<text>Rice University, officially William Marsh Rice University, is a private research university in Houston, Texas, United States. It sits on a campus adjacent to the Houston Museum District and the Texas Medical Center.

Rice University comprises eight schools of academic study, including School of Humanities, School of Social Sciences, Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Business, George R. Brown School of Engineering, Wiess School of Natural Sciences, Susanne M. Glasscock School of Continuing Studies, Rice School of Architecture, and Shepherd School of Music.

Opened in 1912 as the Rice Institute after the murder of its namesake William Marsh Rice, Rice has been a member of the Association of American Universities since 1985 and is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. Rice competes in 14 NCAA Division I varsity sports and is a part of the American Athletic Conference. Its teams are the Rice Owls.

Alumni include 26 Marshall Scholars, 13 Rhodes Scholars, 7 Churchill Scholars, and 3 Nobel laureates.

==History==

===Background===

Rice University&#x27;s history began with the demise of Massachusetts businessman William Marsh Rice, who had made his fortune in real estate, railroad development and cotton trading in the state of Texas. In 1891, Rice decided to charter a free-tuition educational institute in Houston, bearing his name, to be created upon his death, earmarking most of his estate towards funding the project. Rice&#x27;s will specified the institution was to be &quot;a competitive institution of the highest grade&quot; and that only white students would be permitted to attend. On the morning of September 23, 1900, Rice, age 84, was found dead by his valet, Charles F. Jones, and was presumed to have died in his sleep. Shortly thereafter, a large check made out to Rice&#x27;s New York City lawyer, signed by the late Rice, aroused the suspicion of a bank teller, due to the misspelling of the recipient&#x27;s name. The lawyer, Albert T. Patrick, then announced that Rice had changed his will to leave the bulk of his fortune to Patrick, rather than to the creation of Rice&#x27;s educational institute. A subsequent investigation led by the District Attorney of New York resulted in the arrests of Patrick and of Rice&#x27;s butler and valet Charles F. Jones, who had been persuaded to administer chloroform to Rice while he slept. Rice&#x27;s friend and personal lawyer in Houston, Captain James A. Baker, aided in the discovery of what turned out to be a fake will with a forged signature. Jones was not prosecuted since he cooperated with the district attorney, and testified against Patrick. Patrick was found guilty of conspiring to steal Rice&#x27;s fortune and he was convicted of murder in 1901 (he was pardoned in 1912 due to conflicting medical testimony). Baker helped Rice&#x27;s estate direct the fortune, worth $4.6 million in 1904 (equivalent to $ in ), towards the founding of what was to be called the Rice Institute, later to become Rice University. The board took control of the assets on April 29 of that year.
In 1907, the Board of Trustees selected the head of the Department of Mathematics and Astronomy at Princeton University, Edgar Odell Lovett, to head the institute, which was still in the planning stages. He came recommended by Princeton&#x27;s president, Woodrow Wilson. In 1908, Lovett accepted the challenge, and was formally inaugurated as the institute&#x27;s first president on October 12, 1912. Lovett undertook extensive research before formalizing plans for the new Institute, including visits to 78 institutions of higher learning across the world on a long tour between 1908 and 1909. Lovett was impressed by such things as the aesthetic beauty of the uniformity of the architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, a theme which was adopted by the institute, as well as the residential college system at Cambridge University in England, which was added to the Institute several decades later. Lovett called for the establishment of a university &quot;of the highest grade,&quot; &quot;an institution of liberal and technical learning&quot; devoted &quot;quite as much to investigation as to instruction.&quot; [We must] &quot;keep the standards up and the numbers down,&quot; declared Lovett. &quot;The most distinguished teachers must take their part in undergraduate teaching, and their spirit should dominate it all.&quot; 

===Establishment and growth===
In 1911, the cornerstone was laid for the institute&#x27;s first building, the Administration Building, now known as Lovett Hall in honor of the founding president. On September 23, 1912, the 12th anniversary of William Marsh Rice&#x27;s murder, the &quot;William Marsh Rice Institute for the Advancement of Letters, Science, and Art&quot; began course work with 59 enrolled students, who were known as the &quot;59 immortals,&quot; and about a dozen faculty. After 18 additional students joined later, Rice&#x27;s initial class numbered 77, 48 male and 29 female. Unusual for the time, Rice accepted coeducational admissions from its beginning, but on-campus housing would not become co-ed until 1957.

Per William Marsh Rice&#x27;s will and Rice Institute&#x27;s initial charter, the students paid no tuition. Classes were difficult, however, and about half of Rice&#x27;s students had failed after the first 1912 term. At its first commencement ceremony, held on June 12, 1916, Rice awarded 35 bachelor&#x27;s degrees and one master&#x27;s degree. That year, the student body also voted to adopt the Honor System, which still exists today. The first Ph.D. was awarded in 1918 in mathematics.

In the 1920s, many of the university&#x27;s early students were active supporters of the Ku Klux Klan, with a 1922 yearbook showing approximately twenty students wearing Klan robes in a posed photograph. President David Leebron reacted to the re-circulation of these images in 2019 by stating that &quot;It is unsurprising but nonetheless deeply disturbing that racist imagery, including students in blackface and KKK outfits, appeared at Rice with some frequency during the years prior to the admission of black students.&quot; In 1923, a Ku Klux Klan event was held on a Rice-owned Louisiana Street location, near to the home of a Black woman who had filed a lawsuit against the institute in 1909.

The Founder&#x27;s Memorial Statue, a bronze statue of a seated William Marsh Rice, holding the original plans for the campus, was dedicated in 1930, and installed in the central academic quad, facing Lovett Hall. The statue was crafted by John Angel. In 2020, Rice students petitioned the university to take down the statue due to the founder&#x27;s history as a slave owner. In January 2022, the Board of Trustees announced plans to relocate the statue within the academic quadrangle. In November 2023, the statue along with its plinth were taken down in conjunction with a renovation of the Academic Quad.

During World War II, Rice Institute was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program, which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

The residential college system proposed by President Lovett was adopted in 1958, with the East Hall residence becoming Baker College, South Hall residence becoming Will Rice College, West Hall becoming Hanszen College, and the temporary Wiess Hall becoming Wiess College.

In 1959, the Rice Institute Computer went online. 1960 saw Rice Institute formally renamed William Marsh Rice University. Rice acted as a temporary intermediary in the transfer of land between Humble Oil and Refining Company and NASA, for the creation of NASA&#x27;s Manned Spacecraft Center (now called Johnson Space Center) in 1962. President John F. Kennedy then gave a speech at Rice Stadium reiterating that the United States intended to reach the Moon before the end of the decade of the 1960s, and &quot;to become the world&#x27;s leading space-faring nation&quot;. The Rice Space Institute has collaborated with the Johnson Space Center for more than 50 years.

The original charter of Rice Institute dictated that the university admit and educate, tuition-free, &quot;the white inhabitants of Houston, and the state of Texas&quot;. In 1963, the governing board of Rice University filed a lawsuit to allow the university to modify its charter to admit students of all races and to charge tuition. Ph.D. student Raymond Johnson became the first black Rice student when he was admitted that year. In 1964, Rice officially amended the university charter to desegregate its graduate and undergraduate divisions. The Trustees of Rice University prevailed in a lawsuit to void the racial language in the trust in 1966. Rice began charging tuition for the first time in 1965. In the same year, Rice launched a $33-million development campaign (equivalent to $ million in ). $43 million ($ million) was raised by its conclusion in 1970. In 1974, two new schools were founded at Rice, the Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Management and the Shepherd School of Music. The Brown Foundation Challenge, a fund-raising program designed to encourage annual gifts, was launched in 1976 and ended in 1996 having raised $185 million ($ million). The Rice School of Social Sciences was founded in 1979.

On-campus housing was exclusively for men for the first forty years, until 1957. Jones College was the first women&#x27;s residence on the Rice campus, followed by Brown College. According to legend, the women&#x27;s colleges were purposefully situated at the opposite end of campus from the existing men&#x27;s colleges as a way of preserving campus propriety, which was greatly valued by Edgar Odell Lovett, who did not even allow benches to be installed on campus, fearing that they &quot;might lead to co-fraternization of the sexes&quot;. The path linking the north colleges to the center of campus was given the tongue-in-cheek name of &quot;Virgin&#x27;s Walk&quot;. Individual colleges became coeducational between 1973 and 1987, with the single-sex floors of colleges that had them becoming co-ed by 2006. By then, several new residential colleges had been built on campus to handle the university&#x27;s growth, including Lovett College, Sid Richardson College, and Martel College.

===Late twentieth and early twenty-first century===

The Economic Summit of Industrialized Nations was held at Rice in 1990. Three years later, in 1993, the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy was created. In 1997, the Edythe Bates Old Grand Organ and Recital Hall and the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology, renamed in 2005 for the late Nobel Prize winner and Rice professor Richard E. Smalley, were dedicated at Rice. In 1999, the Center for Biological and Environmental Nanotechnology was created. The Rice Owls baseball team was ranked #1 in the nation for the first time in that year (1999), holding the top spot for eight weeks.

In 2003, the Owls won their first national championship in baseball, which was the first for the university in any team sport, beating Southwest Missouri State in the opening game and then the University of Texas and Stanford University twice each en route to the title. In 2008, President David Leebron issued a ten-point plan titled &quot;Vision for the Second Century&quot; outlining plans to increase research funding, strengthen existing programs, and increase collaboration. The plan has brought about another wave of campus constructions, including the newly renamed BioScience Research Collaborative building (intended to foster collaboration with the adjacent Texas Medical Center), a new recreational center and the renovated Autry Court basketball stadium, and the addition of two new residential colleges, Duncan College and McMurtry College.

Beginning in late 2008, the university considered a merger with Baylor College of Medicine, though the merger was ultimately rejected in 2010. Select Rice undergraduates are currently guaranteed admission to Baylor College of Medicine upon graduation as part of the Rice/Baylor Medical Scholars program. According to History Professor John Boles&#x27; 2007 book &quot;University Builder: Edgar Odell Lovett and the Founding of the Rice Institute&quot;, the first president&#x27;s original vision for the university included hopes for future medical and law schools.

In 2018, the university added an online MBA program, MBA@Rice.

In June 2019, the university&#x27;s president announced plans for a task force on Rice&#x27;s &quot;past in relation to slave history and racial injustice&quot;, stating that &quot;Rice has some historical connections to that terrible part of American history and the segregation and racial disparities that resulted directly from it&quot;.

In 2021, President Leebron decided to pursue a development agreement with the City of Houston in response to requests from community members and Rice students regarding the Rice Innovation District. This decision was made instead of implementing a community benefits agreement, which had been suggested by the community. Typically, community benefits agreements involve a community coalition as a signatory, but the proposed agreement with the City of Houston will not include such a coalition.

==Campus==
Located near the city of West University Place, Rice University&#x27;s campus covers a area within Houston&#x27;s museum district and is heavily wooded.
The campus is defined by five streets: Greenbriar Street, Rice Boulevard, Sunset Boulevard, Main Street, and University Boulevard. Throughout its history, Rice University&#x27;s buildings have been situated within this &quot;outer loop.&quot; However, in recent times, new facilities have been constructed in proximity to the campus. Despite this, most of the academic, administrative, and residential structures are still situated within the original pentagonal area. Some off-campus buildings include the Collaborative Research Center, graduate student housing, the Greenbriar building, and the Wiess President&#x27;s House.

Rice University&#x27;s campus houses around 50 buildings that are dispersed between the main entrance located at its easternmost corner and the parking lots and Rice Stadium situated at the western end. The Lynn R. Lowrey Arboretum, consisting of more than 4000 trees and shrubs is spread throughout the campus.

The university&#x27;s first president, Edgar Odell Lovett, intended for the campus to have a uniform architecture style to improve its aesthetic appeal. Nearly every building on campus is noticeably Byzantine in style, with sand and pink-colored bricks, large archways and columns being a common theme among many campus buildings. 

Lovett Hall, named for Rice&#x27;s first president, is the university&#x27;s landmark building. Through its Sallyport arch, new students symbolically enter the university during matriculation and depart as graduates at commencement. Duncan Hall, Rice&#x27;s computational engineering building, was designed to encourage collaboration between the four different departments situated there. The building&#x27;s foyer, drawn from many world cultures, was designed by the architect to symbolically express this collaborative purpose.

The campus is organized in a number of quadrangles. The Academic Quad, anchored by a statue of founder William Marsh Rice, includes Ralph Adams Cram&#x27;s masterpiece, the asymmetrical Lovett Hall, the original administrative building; Fondren Library; Herzstein Hall, the original physics building and home to the largest amphitheater on campus; Sewall Hall for the social sciences and arts; Rayzor Hall for the languages; and Anderson Hall of the Architecture department. The Humanities Building, winner of several architectural awards, is immediately adjacent to the main quad. Further west lies a quad surrounded by McNair Hall of the Jones Business School, the Baker Institute, and Alice Pratt Brown Hall of the Shepherd School of Music. These two quads are surrounded by the university&#x27;s main access road, a one-way loop referred to as the &quot;inner loop&quot;. In the Engineering Quad, a trinity of sculptures by Michael Heizer, collectively entitled &quot;45 Degrees, 90 Degrees, 180 Degrees&quot;, are flanked by Abercrombie Laboratory, the Cox Building, and the Mechanical Laboratory, housing the Electrical, Mechanical, and Earth Science/Civil Engineering departments, respectively. Duncan Hall is the latest addition to this quad, providing new offices for the Computer Science, Computational and Applied Math, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Statistics departments.

Roughly three-quarters of Rice&#x27;s undergraduate population lives on campus. Housing is divided among eleven residential colleges. The colleges are named for university historical figures and benefactor. Five colleges, McMurtry, Duncan, Martel, Jones, and Brown are located on the north side of campus, across from the &quot;South Colleges&quot;, Baker, Will Rice, Lovett, Hanszen, Sid Richardson, and Wiess, on the other side of the Academic Quadrangle. Of the eleven colleges, Baker is the oldest, originally built in 1912, and the twin Duncan and McMurtry colleges are the newest, and opened for the first time for the 2009–10 school year. Will Rice, Baker, and Lovett colleges are undergoing renovation to expand their dining facilities as well as the number of rooms available for students.

The on-campus football facility, Rice Stadium, opened in 1950 with a capacity of 70,000 seats. After improvements in 2006, the stadium is currently configured to seat 47,000 for football but can readily be reconfigured to its original capacity of 70,000. The stadium was the site of Super Bowl VIII and a speech by John F. Kennedy on September 12, 1962, in which he challenged the nation to send a man to the moon by the end of the decade. The recently renovated Tudor Fieldhouse, formerly known as Autry Court, is home to the basketball and volleyball teams. Other stadia include the Rice Track/Soccer Stadium and the Jake Hess Tennis Stadium. A new Rec Center now houses the intramural sports offices and provide an outdoor pool, training and exercise facilities for all Rice students, while athletics training will solely be held at Tudor Fieldhouse and the Rice Football Stadium.

===Innovation District===
In early 2019, Rice announced the site where the abandoned Sears building in Midtown Houston stood, along with its surrounding area, would be transformed into &quot;The Ion,&quot; the hub of the South Main Innovation District. President of Rice, David Leebron stated &quot;We chose the name Ion because it&#x27;s from the Greek ienai, which means &#x27;go&#x27;. We see it as embodying the ever-forward motion of discovery, the spark at the center of a truly original idea. It also represents the last three letters in many of the words that define the building&#x27;s mission, like inspiration, creation, acceleration and innovation.&quot;
Students of Rice and other Houston-area colleges and universities making up the Student Coalition for a Just and Equitable Innovation Corridor are advocating for a community benefits agreement (CBA), a contractual agreement between a developer and a community coalition. Residents of neighboring Third Ward and other members of the Houston Coalition for Equitable Development Without Displacement (HCEDD) have faced consistent opposition from the City of Houston and Rice Management Company to a CBA as traditionally defined, in favor of an agreement between the latter two entities without a community coalition signatory.

==Organization==
Rice University is chartered as a non-profit organization and is governed by a privately appointed board of trustees. The board consists of a maximum of 25 voting members who serve four-year terms. The trustees serve without compensation and a simple majority of trustees must reside in Texas, including at least four within the greater Houston area. The board of trustees delegates its power by appointing a president to serve as the chief executive of the university. Reginald DesRoches was appointed president in 2022 and succeeded David W. Leebron, who served since 2004. The provost, three executive vice presidents, and seven vice presidents report to the president.

The university&#x27;s academics are organized into several schools. The Susanne M. Glasscock School of Continuing Studies has only graduate programs. Schools that have undergraduate and graduate programs include:
* Rice University School of Architecture
* George R. Brown School of Engineering and Computing
* School of Humanities
* Shepherd School of Music
* Wiess School of Natural Sciences
* Rice University School of Social Sciences
* Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Management

Rice&#x27;s undergraduate students are admitted from a centralized admissions process, which admits new students to the university as a whole, rather than a specific school (the schools of Music and Architecture are decentralized). Students are encouraged to select the major path that best suits their desires; a student can later decide that they would rather pursue study in another field, or continue their current coursework and add a second or third major. These transitions are designed to be simple, with students not required to decide on a specific major until their sophomore year of study. Rice offers 360 degrees in over 60 departments. There are 40 undergraduate degree programs, 51 masters programs, and 29 doctoral programs.

Faculty members of each of the departments elect chairs to represent the department to each School&#x27;s dean and the deans report to the Provost who serves as the chief officer for academic affairs.

=== Rice Management Company ===
The Rice Management Company manages the $8.1 billion Rice University endowment (June 2021) and $1.1 billion debt. The endowment provides 40% of Rice&#x27;s operating revenues.

In August 2021, an economic development agreement that would provide Rice Management Company with up to $65 million in cost reimbursement from local taxes was given initial approval by the Midtown Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone. The agreement does not require a community benefits agreement in exchange for funding. Final approval requires a vote by the Houston City Council.

==Academics==

Rice is a medium-sized, highly residential research university. The majority of enrollments are in the full-time, four-year undergraduate program emphasizing arts &amp; sciences and professions. There is a very high level of research activity. It is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools as well as the professional accreditation agencies for engineering, management, and architecture.

Each of Rice&#x27;s departments is organized into one of three distribution groups, and students whose major lies within the scope of one group must take at least 3 courses of at least 3 credit hours each of approved distribution classes in each of the other two groups, as well as completing one physical education course as part of the LPAP (Lifetime Physical Activity Program) requirement. All new students must take a Freshman Writing Intensive Seminar (FWIS) class, and for students who do not pass the university&#x27;s composition examination (administered during the summer before matriculation), FWIS 100, a writing class, becomes an additional requirement.

The majority of Rice&#x27;s undergraduate degree programs grant B.S. or B.A. degrees. Rice has recently begun to offer minors in areas such as business, energy and water sustainability, and global health.

===Student body===
As of fall 2022, men make up 51.1% of the undergraduate body and 63.1% of the professional and post-graduate student body. 36.9% of degree-seeking students are from out of state, 35.9% are from Texas and 27.2% are from outside of the United States. In 2022, the largest proportion of international students came from Asian countries, with 1623 out of the 2344 total students (or 69.24%) coming from China (1145), India (296), Taiwan (93), and Korea (89). Consequently, accounting for international students, whose identities are not disaggregated in Department of Education statistics, the largest student racial group at Rice University is Asian.

===Honor Code===
The Rice Honor Code plays an integral role in academic affairs. Almost all Rice exams are unproctored and professors give timed, closed-book exams that students take home and complete at their own convenience. Potential infractions are reported to the student Honor Council, elected by popular vote. The penalty structure is established every year by Council consensus; typically, penalties have ranged from a letter of reprimand to an &#x27;F&#x27; in the course and a two semester suspension. During Orientation Week, students must take and pass a test demonstrating that they understand the Honor System&#x27;s requirements and sign a Matriculation Pledge. On assignments, Rice students affirm their commitment to the Honor Code by writing &quot;&quot;On my honor, I have neither given nor received any unauthorized aid on this [examination, quiz or paper]&quot;.&quot;

Rice was ranked 1st in the world in materials science research by the Times Higher Education (THE) in 2010.

==Student life==

Rice University&#x27;s campus is located in Houston&#x27;s Museum District and surrounded by greenery, adjacent to Hermann Park, Rice Village, and the Texas Medical Center. Hermann Park features many attractions, including the Houston Museum of Natural Science, Miller Outdoor Theatre, and a municipal golf course. The Houston METRORail system provides access to downtown&#x27;s theatre and nightlife district and Reliant Park, with a station located adjacent to the university&#x27;s main gate. In 2008, Rice University joined the Zipcar program, providing two vehicles to offer more transportation options for students who do not have access to a vehicle.

===Residential colleges===

In 1957, Rice University implemented a residential college system, which was proposed by the university&#x27;s first president, Edgar Odell Lovett. The system was inspired by existing systems in place in England and at several other universities in the United States. The existing residences known as East, South, West, and Wiess Halls became Baker, Will Rice, Hanszen, and Wiess Colleges, respectively.

====List of residential colleges ====
Below is a list of residential colleges in order of founding:
* Baker College, named in honor of Captain James A. Baker, friend and attorney of William Marsh Rice, and first chair of the Rice Board of Governors
* Will Rice College, named for William M. Rice, Jr., the nephew of the university&#x27;s founder, William Marsh Rice
* Hanszen College, named for Harry Clay Hanszen, benefactor to the university and chairman of the Rice Board of Governors from 1946 to 1950
* Wiess College, named for Harry Carothers Wiess (1887–1948), one of the founders and one-time president of Humble Oil, now ExxonMobil
* Jones College, named for Mary Gibbs Jones, wife of prominent Houston philanthropist Jesse Holman Jones
* Brown College, named for Margarett Root Brown by her in-laws, George R. Brown
* Lovett College, named after the university&#x27;s first president, Edgar Odell Lovett.
* Sid Richardson College, named for the Sid Richardson Foundation, which was established by Texas oilman, cattleman, and philanthropist Sid W. Richardson
* Martel College, named for Marian and Speros P. Martel, was built in 2002
* McMurtry College, named for Rice alumni Burt and Deedee McMurtry, Silicon Valley venture capitalists
* Duncan College, named for Charles Duncan, Jr., U.S. Secretary of Energy, 1979-1981

Each residential college has its own cafeteria (serveries) and each residential college has study groups and its own social practices.

Although each college is composed of a full cross-section of students at Rice, they have over time developed their own traditions and &quot;personalities.&quot; When students matriculate they are randomly assigned to one of the eleven colleges, although &quot;legacy&quot; exceptions are made for students whose siblings or parents have attended Rice. Students generally remain members of the college that they are assigned to for the duration of their undergraduate careers, even if they move off-campus at any point. Students are guaranteed on-campus housing for freshman year and two of the next three years; each college has its own system for determining allocation of the remaining spaces, collectively known as &quot;Room Jacking&quot;. Students develop strong loyalties to their college and maintain friendly rivalry with other colleges, especially during events such as Beer Bike and O-Week. Colleges keep their rivalries alive by performing &quot;jacks,&quot; or pranks, on each other, especially during O-Week and Beer Bike Week. During Matriculation, Commencement, and other formal academic ceremonies, the colleges process in the order in which they were established.

====Baker 13====

Baker 13 is a tradition in which students run around campus wearing nothing but shoes and shaving cream at 10 p.m. on the 13th and the 31st of every month, as well as the 26th on months with fewer than 31 days. The event, long sponsored by Baker College, usually attracts a small number of students, but Halloween night and the first and last relevant days of the school year both attract large numbers of revelers.
====Beer Bike Race====
According to the official website, &quot;Beer Bike is a combination intramural bicycle race and drinking competition dating back to 1957. Ten riders and ten chuggers make up a team. Elaborate rules include details such as a prohibition of &quot;bulky or wet clothing articles designed to absorb beer/water or prevent spilled beer/water from being seen&quot; and regulations for chug can design. Each residential college as well as the Graduate Student Association participates with a men&#x27;s team, a women&#x27;s team, and alumni (co-ed) team. Each leg of the race is a relay in which a team&#x27;s &quot;chugger&quot; must chug of beer or water for the men&#x27;s division and for women before the team&#x27;s &quot;rider&quot; may begin to ride. Participants who both ride and chug are referred to as &quot;Ironmen&quot;. Willy Week is a term coined in the 1990s to refer to the week preceding Beer Bike, a time of general energy and excitement on campus. Jacks (pranks) are especially common during Willy Week; some examples in the past include removing showerheads and encasing the Hanszen guardian.&quot;
The morning of the Beer Bike race itself begins with what is by some estimations the largest annual water balloon fight in the world. Beer Bike is Rice&#x27;s most prominent student event, and for younger alumni it serves as an unofficial reunion weekend on par with Homecoming. The 2009 Beer Bike race was dedicated to the memory of Dr. Bill Wilson, a popular professor and long-time resident associate of Wiess College who died earlier that year.

In the event of inclement weather, Beer Bike becomes a Beer Run. The rules are nearly identical, except that the Bikers must instead run the length of the track.

===Campus institutions===
====Rice Coffeehouse====
Rice Coffeehouse began in Hanszen College, where students would serve coffee in the Weenie Loft, a study room in the old section&#x27;s fourth floor. Later, the coffee house moved to the Hanszen basement to accommodate more student patrons. That coffeehouse became known as Breadsticks and Pomegranates, and closed due to flooding. Demand for an on-campus Coffeehouse grew and in 1990, the Rice Coffeehouse was founded.

The Rice Coffeehouse is a not-for-profit student-run organization serving Rice University and the greater Houston community. Over the past few years, it has introduced fair-trade and organic coffee and loose-leaf teas.

Coffeehouse baristas are referred to as K.O.C.&#x27;s, or Keepers of the Coffee. Rice Coffeehouse has also adopted an unofficial mascot, the squirrel, which can be found on T-shirts, mugs, and bumper stickers stuck on laptops across campus. The logo pays tribute to Rice&#x27;s squirrel population, claimed by students to be unusually plump and frighteningly tame.

====The Pub at Rice====
Formerly known as Willy&#x27;s Pub, The Pub at Rice is Rice&#x27;s student-run pub located in the basement of the Rice Memorial Center. It opened on April 11, 1975, with Rice President Norman Hackerman pouring the first beer. The original name was chosen by students in tribute to the university&#x27;s founder, William Marsh Rice. After the drinking age in Texas was raised in 1986, the pub entered a period of financial difficulties and in April 1995, was destroyed in a fire. The space was gutted but renovated and remains open. On February 15, 2022, the Rice Thresher announced the rebranding of Willy&#x27;s Pub as The Pub at Rice.

====Rice Bikes====
Rice Bikes is a full-service on-campus bicycle sale, rental, and repair shop. It originated in the basement of Sid Richardson College in February 2011. In 2012, Rice Bikes officially became the university&#x27;s third student-run business. Rice Bikes merged with a student-run bicycle rental business in 2013, and operations moved to the Rice Memorial Center in 2014. In 2017, the business moved to the garage of the Rice Housing and Dining department&#x27;s headquarters.

Rice Bikes functions as a full bicycle repair shop.

====Student-run media====
Rice has a weekly student newspaper (&quot;The Rice Thresher&quot;), a yearbook (The Campanile ), college radio station (KTRU Rice Radio), and now defunct, campus-wide student television station (RTV5). They are based out of the RMC student center. In addition, Rice hosts several student magazines dedicated to a range of different topics; the spring semester of 2008 saw the founding of two magazines, a literary sex journal called &quot;Open&quot; and an undergraduate science research magazine entitled &quot;Catalyst&quot;.
&quot;The Rice Thresher&quot; is published every Wednesday and is ranked by Princeton Review as one of the top campus newspapers nationally for student readership. It is distributed around campus, and at a few other local businesses and has a website. The &quot;Thresher&quot; has a small staff and has campus news, open submission opinion page, and the satirical Backpage, which has often been the center of controversy. The newspaper has won several awards from the College Media Association, Associated Collegiate Press and Texas Intercollegiate Press Association.

The Rice Campanile was first published in 1916 celebrating Rice&#x27;s first graduating class. It has published continuously since then, publishing two volumes in 1944 since the university had two graduating classes due to World War II. The website was created sometime in the early to mid 2000s.

KTRU Rice Radio is the student-run radio station. It plays genres and artists of music and sound unavailable on other radio stations in Houston, and often, the US. The station takes requests over the phone or online. In 2000 and 2006, KTRU won Houston Press&#x27; Best Radio Station in Houston. In 2003, Rice alum and active KTRU DJ DL&#x27;s hip-hip show won Houston Press&#x27; Best Hip-hop Radio Show. On August 17, 2010, it was announced that Rice University had been in negotiations to sell the station&#x27;s broadcast tower, FM frequency and license to the University of Houston System to become a full-time classical music and fine arts programming station. The new station, KUHA, would be operated as a not-for-profit outlet with listener supporters. The FCC approved the sale and granted the transfer of license to the University of Houston System on April 15, 2011, however, KUHA proved to be an even larger failure and so after four and a half years of operation, The University of Houston System announced that KUHA&#x27;s broadcast tower, FM frequency and license were once again up for sale in August 2015. KTRU continued to operate much as it did previously, streaming live on the Internet, via apps, and on HD2 radio using the 90.1 signal. Under student leadership, KTRU explored the possibility of returning to FM radio for a number of years. In spring 2015, KTRU was granted permission by the FCC to begin development of a new broadcast signal via LPFM radio. On October 1, 2015, KTRU made its official return to FM radio on the 96.1 signal. While broadcasting on HD2 radio has been discontinued, KTRU continues to broadcast via internet in addition to its LPFM signal.

RTV5 is a student-run television network available as channel 5 on campus. RTV5 was created initially as Rice Broadcast Television in 1997; RBT began to broadcast the following year in 1998, and aired its first live show across campus in 1999. It experienced much growth and exposure over the years with successful programs like &quot;Drinking with Phil”, “The Meg &amp; Maggie Show”, which was a variety and call-in show, a weekly news show, and extensive live coverage in December 2000 of the shut down of KTRU by the administration. In spring 2001, the Rice undergraduate community voted in the general elections to support RBT as a blanket tax organization, effectively providing a yearly income of $10,000 to purchase new equipment and provide the campus with a variety of new programming. In the spring of 2005, RBT members decided the station needed a new image and a new name: Rice Television 5. One of RTV5&#x27;s most popular shows was the 24-hour show, where a camera and couch placed in the RMC stayed on air for 24 hours. One such show is held in fall and another in spring, usually during a weekend allocated for visits by prospective students. RTV5 has a video on demand site at rtv5.rice.edu. The station went off the air in 2014 and changed its name to Rice Video Productions. In 2015 the group&#x27;s funding was threatened, but ultimately maintained. In 2016 the small student staff requested to no longer be a blanket-tax organization.

&quot;The Rice Review&quot;, also known as R2, is a yearly student-run literary journal at Rice University that publishes prose, poetry, and creative nonfiction written by undergraduate students, as well as interviews. The journal was founded in 2004 by creative writing professor and author Justin Cronin.

&quot;The Rice Standard&quot; was an independent, student-run variety magazine modeled after such publications as &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;. Prior to fall 2009, it was regularly published three times a semester with a wide array of content, running from analyses of current events and philosophical pieces to personal essays, short fiction and poetry. In August 2009, the &quot;Standard&quot; transitioned to a completely online format with the launch of their redesigned website, ricestandard.org. The first website of its kind on Rice&#x27;s campus, the &quot;Standard&quot; featured blog-style content written by and for Rice students. &quot;The Rice Standard&quot; had around 20 regular contributors, and the site features new content every day (including holidays).

&quot;Open&quot;, a magazine dedicated to &quot;literary sex content&quot;, predictably caused a stir on campus with its initial publication in spring 2008. A mixture of essays, editorials, stories and artistic photography brought attention both on campus and in the Houston Chronicle. The third and last annual edition of &quot;Open&quot; was released in spring of 2010.

==Athletics==
Rice plays in NCAA Division I athletics and has been a member of the American Athletic Conference since 2023. A founding member of the Southwest Conference until its dissolution in 1996, Rice was later a member of the Western Athletic Conference before joining Conference USA in 2005. Rice is the second-smallest school, measured by undergraduate enrollment, competing in NCAA Division I FBS football, only ahead of Tulsa.

The Rice baseball team won the 2003 College World Series, defeating Stanford, giving Rice its only national championship in a team sport. The victory made Rice University the smallest school in 51 years to win a national championship at the highest collegiate level of the sport. The Rice baseball team has played on campus at Reckling Park since the 2000 season. , the baseball team has won 14 consecutive conference championships in three different conferences: the final championship of the defunct Southwest Conference, all nine championships while a member of the Western Athletic Conference, and five more championships in its first five years as a member of Conference USA. Additionally, Rice&#x27;s baseball team has finished third in both the 2006 and 2007 College World Series tournaments. Rice now has made six trips to Omaha for the CWS. In 2004, Rice became the first school ever to have three players selected in the first eight picks of the MLB draft when Philip Humber, Jeff Niemann, and Wade Townsend were selected third, fourth, and eighth, respectively. In 2007, Joe Savery was selected as the 19th overall pick.
In 2004–05, Rice sent its women&#x27;s volleyball, soccer, and basketball teams to their respective NCAA tournaments. The women&#x27;s swim team has consistently brought at least one member of their team to the NCAA championships since 2013. In 2005–06, the women&#x27;s soccer, basketball, and tennis teams advanced, with five individuals competing in track and field. In 2006–07, the Rice women&#x27;s basketball team made the NCAA tournament, while again five Rice track and field athletes received individual NCAA berths. In 2008, the women&#x27;s volleyball team again made the NCAA tournament. 
In 2011 the Women&#x27;s Swim team won their first conference championship in the history of the university. This was an impressive feat considering they won without having a diving team. The team repeated their C-USA success in 2013 and 2014. 
In 2017, the women&#x27;s basketball team, led by second-year head coach Tina Langley, won the Women&#x27;s Basketball Invitational, defeating UNC-Greensboro 74–62 in the championship game at Tudor Fieldhouse. 
Though not a varsity sport, Rice&#x27;s ultimate frisbee women&#x27;s team, named Torque, won consecutive Division III national championships in 2014 and 2015.

In 2006, the football team qualified for its first bowl game since 1961, ending the second-longest bowl drought in the country at the time. On December 22, 2006, Rice played in the New Orleans Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana against the Sun Belt Conference champion, Troy. The Owls lost 41–17. The bowl appearance came after Rice had a 14-game losing streak from 2004 to 2005 and went 1–10 in 2005. The streak followed an internally authorized 2003 McKinsey report that stated football alone was responsible for a $4 million deficit in 2002. Tensions remained high between the athletic department and faculty, as a few professors who chose to voice their opinion were in favor of abandoning the football program. The program success in 2006, the &quot;Rice Renaissance,&quot; proved to be a revival of the Owl football program, quelling those tensions. David Bailiff took over the program in 2007 and has remained head coach. Jarett Dillard set an NCAA record in 2006 by catching a touchdown pass in 13 consecutive games and took a 15-game overall streak into the 2007 season.
In 2008, the football team posted a 9–3 regular season, capping off the year with a 38–14 victory over Western Michigan University in the Texas Bowl. The win over Western Michigan marked the Owls&#x27; first bowl win in 45 years.

Rice Stadium also serves as the performance venue for the university&#x27;s Marching Owl Band, or &quot;MOB.&quot; Despite its name, the MOB is a scatter band that focuses on performing humorous skits and routines rather than traditional formation marching.

Rice Owls men&#x27;s basketball won 10 conference titles in the former Southwest Conference (1918, 1935*, 1940, 1942*, 1943*, 1944*, 1945, 1949*, 1954*, 1970; * denotes shared title). Most recently, guard Morris Almond was drafted in the first round of the 2007 NBA draft by the Utah Jazz. Rice named former Cal Bears head coach Ben Braun as head basketball coach to succeed Willis Wilson, fired after Rice finished the 2007–2008 season with a winless (0–16) conference record and overall record of 3–27.

Rice&#x27;s mascot is Sammy the Owl. In previous decades, the university kept several live owls on campus in front of Lovett College, but this practice has been discontinued, due to public concern regarding animal welfare.

Rice also has a 12-member coed cheerleading squad and a coed dance team, both of which perform at football and basketball games throughout the year.

<text>Richard Errett Smalley (June 6, 1943 – October 28, 2005) was an American chemist who was the Gene and Norman Hackerman Professor of Chemistry, Physics, and Astronomy at Rice University. In 1996, along with Robert Curl, also a professor of chemistry at Rice, and Harold Kroto, a professor at the University of Sussex, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of a new form of carbon, buckminsterfullerene, also known as buckyballs. He was an advocate of nanotechnology and its applications.

==Early life and education==
Smalley, the youngest of 4 siblings, was born in Akron, Ohio on June 6, 1943, to Frank Dudley Smalley, Jr., and Esther Virginia Rhoads. He grew up in Kansas City, Missouri. Richard Smalley credits his father, mother and aunt as formative influences in industry, science and chemistry. His father, Frank Dudley Smalley, Jr. worked with mechanical and electrical equipment and eventually became CEO of a trade journal for farm implements called &quot;Implement and Tractor&quot;. His mother, Esther Rhoads Smalley, completed her B.A. Degree while Richard was a teenager. She was particularly inspired by mathematician Norman N. Royall Jr., who taught Foundations of Physical Science, and communicated her love of science to her son through long conversations and joint activities. Smalley&#x27;s maternal aunt, pioneering female chemist Sara Jane Rhoads, interested Smalley in the field of chemistry, letting him work in her organic chemistry laboratory, and suggesting that he attend Hope College, which had a strong chemistry program.

Smalley attended Hope College for two years before transferring to the University of Michigan where he received his Bachelor of Science in 1965, performing undergraduate research in the laboratory of Raoul Kopelman. Between his studies, he also worked in industry, where he developed his unique managerial style. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1973 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled &quot;The lower electronic states of 1,3,5 (sym)-triazine&quot;, under the supervision of Elliot R. Bernstein. He did postdoctoral work at the University of Chicago from 1973 to 1976, with Donald Levy and Lennard Wharton where he was a pioneer in the development of supersonic beam laser spectroscopy.

==Career==
In 1976, Smalley joined Rice University. In 1982, he was appointed to the Gene and Norman Hackerman Chair in Chemistry at Rice. He helped to found the Rice Quantum Institute in 1979, serving as chairman from 1986 to 1996. In 1990, he became also a professor in the department of physics. In 1990, he helped to found the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology. In 1996, he was appointed its director.

He became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1990, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1991.

===Fullerenes===
Smalley&#x27;s research in physical chemistry investigated the formation of inorganic and semiconductor clusters using pulsed molecular beams and time-of-flight mass spectrometry. As a consequence of this expertise, Robert Curl introduced him to Harry Kroto in order to investigate a question about the constituents of astronomical dust. These are carbon-rich grains expelled by old stars such as R Coronae Borealis. The result of this collaboration was the discovery of C60 (known as Buckyballs) and the fullerenes as the third allotropic form of carbon.

Smalley recognized that the structure of C60 was like that of a soccer ball after cutting and tapping hexagons together in a three-dimensional manner, utilizing 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons. He was also responsible for the name of C60, naming it after Buckminster Fuller, an American architect who was known for his use of geodesic domes in his designs. 

The research that earned Kroto, Smalley and Curl the Nobel Prize mostly comprised three articles. First was the discovery of C60 in the November 14, 1985, issue of &quot;Nature&quot;, &quot;C60: Buckminsterfullerene&quot;. The second article detailed the discovery of the endohedral fullerenes in &quot;Lanthanum Complexes of Spheroidal Carbon Shells&quot; in the &quot;Journal of the American Chemical Society&quot; (1985). The third announced the discovery of the fullerenes in &quot;Reactivity of Large Carbon Clusters: Spheroidal Carbon Shells and Their Possible Relevance to the Formation and Morphology of Soot&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Physical Chemistry&quot; (1986).

Although only three people can be cited for a Nobel Prize, graduate students James R. Heath, Yuan Liu, and Sean C. O&#x27;Brien participated in the work. Smalley mentioned Heath and O&#x27;Brien in his Nobel Lecture. Heath went on to become a professor at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and O&#x27;Brien joined Texas Instruments and is now at MEMtronics. Yuan Liu is a Senior Staff Scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

This research is significant for the discovery of a new allotrope of carbon known as a fullerene. Other allotropes of carbon include graphite, diamond and graphene. Harry Kroto&#x27;s 1985 paper entitled &quot;C60: Buckminsterfullerine&quot;, published with colleagues J. R. Heath, S. C. O&#x27;Brien, R. F. Curl, and R. E. Smalley, was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented to Rice University in 2015. The discovery of fullerenes was recognized in 2010 by the designation of a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society at the Richard E. Smalley Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology at Rice University in Houston, Texas.

===Nanotechnology===
Following nearly a decade&#x27;s worth of research into the formation of alternate fullerene compounds (e.g. C28, C70), as well as the synthesis of endohedral metallofullerenes (M@C60), reports of the identification of carbon nanotube structures led Smalley to begin investigating their iron-catalyzed synthesis.

As a consequence of this research, Smalley was able to persuade the administration of Rice University, under then-president Malcolm Gillis, to create Rice&#x27;s Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) focusing on any aspect of molecular nanotechnology. It was renamed The Richard E. Smalley Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology after Smalley&#x27;s death in 2005, and has since merged with the Rice Quantum Institute, becoming the Smalley-Curl Institute (SCI) in 2015.

Smalley&#x27;s latest research was focused on carbon nanotubes, specifically focusing on the chemical synthesis side of nanotube research. He is well known for his group&#x27;s invention of the high-pressure carbon monoxide (HiPco) method of producing large batches of high-quality nanotubes. Smalley spun off his work into a company, Carbon Nanotechnologies Inc. and associated nanotechnologies.

Smalley and his lab worked solely in this area of study and nothing else for approximately 10 years, up until the end of his life. His research lab carried the slogan &quot;If it ain&#x27;t tubes, we don&#x27;t do it&quot; proudly. 

===Dispute on molecular assemblers===
He was an outspoken skeptic of the idea of molecular assemblers, as advocated by K. Eric Drexler. His main scientific objections, which he termed the &quot;fat fingers problem&quot; and the &quot;sticky fingers problem&quot;, argued against the feasibility of molecular assemblers being able to precisely select and place individual atoms. He also believed that Drexler&#x27;s speculations about apocalyptic dangers of molecular assemblers threatened the public support for development of nanotechnology. He debated Drexler in an exchange of letters which were published in &quot;Chemical &amp; Engineering News&quot; as a point-counterpoint feature.

==Advocacy==
Starting in the late 1990s, Smalley advocated for the need for cheap, clean energy, which he described as the number one problem facing humanity in the 21st century. He described what he called &quot;The Terawatt Challenge&quot;, the need to develop a new power source capable of increasing &quot;our energy output by a minimum factor of two, the generally agreed-upon number, certainly by the middle of the century, but preferably well before that.&quot;

He also presented a list entitled &quot;Top Ten Problems of Humanity for Next 50 Years&quot;. It can be interesting to compare his list, in order of priority, to the Ten Threats formulated by the U.N.&#x27;s High Level Threat Panel in 2004. Smalley&#x27;s list, in order of priority, was:
# Energy
# Water
# Food
# Environment
# Poverty
# Terrorism &amp; war
# Disease
# Education
# Democracy
# Population

Smalley regarded several problems as interlinked: the lack of people entering the fields of science and engineering, the need for an alternative to fossil fuels, and the need to address global warming. He felt that improved science education was essential, and strove to encourage young students to consider careers in science. His slogan for this effort was &quot;Be a scientist, save the world.&quot;

Smalley was a leading advocate of the National Nanotechnology Initiative in 2003. Suffering from hair loss and weakness as a result of his chemotherapy treatments, Smalley testified before the congressional testimonies, arguing for the potential benefits of nanotechnology in the development of targeted cancer therapies. Bill 189, the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act, was introduced in the Senate on January 16, 2003, by Senator Ron Wyden, passed the Senate on November 18, 2003, and at the House of Representatives the next day with a 405–19 vote. President George W. Bush signed the act into law on December 3, 2003, as Public Law 108-
153. Smalley was invited to attend.

==Personal life==
Smalley was married four times, to Judith Grace Sampieri (1968–1978), Mary L. Chapieski (1980–1994), JoNell M. Chauvin (1997–1998) and Deborah Sheffield (2005), and had two sons, Chad Richard Smalley (born June 8, 1969) and Preston Reed Smalley (born August 8, 1997).

In 1999, Smalley was diagnosed with cancer. Smalley died of leukemia, variously reported as non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, on October 28, 2005, at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, at the age of 62.

Upon Smalley&#x27;s death, the US Senate passed a resolution to honor Smalley, crediting him as the &quot;Father of Nanotechnology.&quot;

===Religion during final years===
Smalley, who had taken classes in religion as well as science at Hope College, rediscovered his religious foundation in later life, particularly during his final years while battling cancer. During the final year of his life, Smalley wrote: &quot;Although I suspect I will never fully understand, I now think the answer is very simple: it&#x27;s true. God did create the universe about 13.7 billion years ago, and of necessity has involved Himself with His creation ever since.&quot;

At the Tuskegee University&#x27;s 79th Annual Scholarship Convocation/Parents&#x27; Recognition Program he was quoted making the following statement regarding the subject of evolution while urging his audience to take seriously their role as the higher species on this planet. Genesis&#x27; was right, and there was a creation, and that Creator is still involved ... We are the only species that can destroy the Earth or take care of it and nurture all that live on this very special planet. I&#x27;m urging you to look on these things. For whatever reason, this planet was built specifically for us. Working on this planet is an absolute moral code. ... Let&#x27;s go out and do what we were put on Earth to do.&quot; Old Earth creationist and astronomer Hugh Ross spoke at Smalley&#x27;s funeral, November 2, 2005.

<doc id="25815" wikidata="Q110930" url="?curid=25815" title="Robert Curl">
<text>Robert Floyd Curl Jr. (August 23, 1933 – July 3, 2022) was an American chemist who was Pitzer–Schlumberger Professor of Natural Sciences and professor of chemistry at Rice University. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1996 for the discovery of the nanomaterial buckminsterfullerene, and hence the fullerene class of materials, along with Richard Smalley (also of Rice University) and Harold Kroto of the University of Sussex.

== Early life and education ==
Born in Alice, Texas, United States, Curl was the son of a Methodist minister. Due to his father&#x27;s missionary work, his family moved several times within southern and southwestern Texas, and the elder Curl was involved in starting the San Antonio Medical Center&#x27;s Methodist Hospital. Curl attributes his interest in chemistry to a chemistry set he received as a nine-year-old, recalling that he ruined the finish on his mother&#x27;s porcelain stove when nitric acid boiled over onto it. He is a graduate of Thomas Jefferson High School in San Antonio, Texas. His high school offered only one year of chemistry instruction, but in his senior year his chemistry teacher gave him special projects to work on.

Curl received a Bachelor of Arts in chemistry from Rice Institute (now Rice University) in 1954. He was attracted to the reputation of both the school&#x27;s academics and football team, and the fact that at the time it charged no tuition. He earned his doctorate in chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1957. At Berkeley, he worked in the laboratory of Kenneth Pitzer, then dean of the college of chemistry, with whom he would become a lifelong collaborator. Curl&#x27;s graduate research involved performing infrared spectroscopy to determine the bond angle of disiloxane.

==Scientific career==
Curl was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University with E. B. Wilson, where he used microwave spectroscopy to study the bond rotation barriers of molecules. After that, he joined the faculty of Rice University in 1958. He inherited the equipment and graduate students of George Bird, a professor who was leaving for a job at Polaroid. Curl&#x27;s early research involved the microwave spectroscopy of chlorine dioxide. His research program included both experiment and theory, mainly focused on detection and analysis of free radicals using microwave spectroscopy and tunable lasers. He used these observations to develop the theory of their fine structure and hyperfine structure, as well as information about their structure and the kinetics of their reactions.

== Nobel Prize ==
Curl&#x27;s research at Rice involved the fields of infrared and microwave spectroscopy. Curl&#x27;s research inspired Richard Smalley to come to Rice in 1976 with the intention of collaborating with Curl. In 1985, Curl was contacted by Harold Kroto, who wanted to use a laser beam apparatus built by Smalley to simulate and study the formation of carbon chains in red giant stars. Smalley and Curl had previously used this apparatus to study semiconductors such as silicon and germanium. They were initially reluctant to interrupt their experiments on these semiconductor materials to use their apparatus for Kroto&#x27;s experiments on carbon, but eventually gave in.

They indeed found the long carbon chains they were looking for, but also found an unexpected product that had 60 carbon atoms. Over the course of 11 days, the team studied and determined its structure and named it buckminsterfullerene after noting its similarity to the geodesic domes for which the architect Buckminster Fuller was known. This discovery was based solely on the single prominent peak on the mass spectrograph, implying a chemically inert substance that was geometrically closed with no dangling bonds. Curl was responsible for determining the optimal conditions of the carbon vapor in the apparatus, and examining the spectrograph. Curl noted that James R. Heath and Sean C. O&#x27;Brien deserve equal recognition in the work to Smalley and Kroto. The existence of this type of molecule had earlier been theorized by others, but Curl and his colleagues were at the time unaware of this. Later experiments confirmed their proposed structure, and the team moved on to synthesize endohedral fullerenes that had a metal atom inside the hollow carbon shell. The fullerenes, a class of molecules of which buckminsterfullerene was the first member discovered, are now considered to have potential applications in nanomaterials and molecular scale electronics. Robert Curl&#x27;s 1985 paper entitled &quot;C60: Buckminsterfullerine&quot;, published with colleagues H. Kroto, J. R. Heath, S. C. O’Brien, and R. E. Smalley, was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented to Rice University in 2015. The discovery of fullerenes was recognized in 2010 by the designation of a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society at the Richard E. Smalley Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology at Rice University in Houston, Texas.

After winning the Nobel Prize in 1996, Curl took a quieter path than Smalley, who became an outspoken advocate of nanotechnology, and Kroto, who used his fame to further his interest in science education, saying, &quot;After winning a Nobel, you can either become a scientific pontificator, or you can have some idea for a new science project and you can use your newfound notoriety to get the resources to do it. Or you can say, &#x27;Well, I enjoy what I was doing, and I want to keep doing that.&#x27;&quot; True to that humility, when asked by the President of Rice what he would like, following the Nobel announcement, he asked that a bike rack be installed closer to his office and laboratory.

== Later research ==
Curl&#x27;s later research interests involved physical chemistry, developing DNA genotyping and sequencing instrumentation, and creating photoacoustic sensors for trace gases using quantum cascade lasers. He is known in the residential college life at Rice University for being the first master of Lovett College.

Curl retired in 2008 at the age of 74, becoming a University Professor Emeritus, Pitzer-Schlumberger Professor of Natural Sciences Emeritus, and Professor of Chemistry Emeritus at Rice University.

==Personal life==
Curl married Jonel Whipple in 1955, with whom he had two children. He cycled to his office and lab and every week played bridge with the Rice Bridge Brigade. Curl died in Houston on July 3, 2022, at the age of 88.

<doc id="25816" wikidata="Q17167" url="?curid=25816" title="Roman Republic">
<text>The Roman Republic ( ) was the era of classical Roman civilisation beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom (traditionally dated to 509 BC) and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire following the War of Actium. During this period, Rome&#x27;s control expanded from the city&#x27;s immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world.

Roman society at the time was primarily a cultural mix of Latin and Etruscan societies, as well as of Sabine, Oscan, and Greek cultural elements, which is especially visible in the Ancient Roman religion and its pantheon. Its political organisation developed at around the same time as direct democracy in Ancient Greece, with collective and annual magistracies, overseen by a senate. There were annual elections, but the republican system was an elective oligarchy, not a democracy; a small number of powerful families largely monopolised the magistracies. Roman institutions underwent considerable changes throughout the Republic to adapt to the difficulties it faced, such as the creation of promagistracies to rule its conquered provinces, and differences in the composition of the senate.

Unlike the of the Roman Empire, throughout the republican era Rome was in a state of near-perpetual war. Its first enemies were its Latin and Etruscan neighbours, as well as the Gauls, who sacked Rome in 387 BC. After the Gallic sack, Rome conquered the whole Italian Peninsula in a century and thus became a major power in the Mediterranean. Its greatest strategic rival was Carthage, against which it waged three wars. Rome defeated Carthage at the Battle of Zama in 202 BC, becoming the dominant power of the ancient Mediterranean world. It then embarked on a long series of difficult conquests, defeating Philip V and Perseus of Macedon, Antiochus III of the Seleucid Empire, the Lusitanian Viriathus, the Numidian Jugurtha, the Pontic king Mithridates VI, Vercingetorix of the Arverni tribe of Gaul, and the Egyptian queen Cleopatra. 

At home, during the Conflict of the Orders, the patricians, the closed oligarchic elite, came into conflict with the more numerous plebs; this was resolved peacefully, with the plebs achieving political equality by the 4th century BC. The late Republic, from 133 BC onward, saw substantial domestic strife, often anachronistically seen as a conflict between optimates and populares, referring to conservative and reformist politicians, respectively. The Social War between Rome and its Italian allies over citizenship and Roman hegemony in Italy greatly expanded the scope of civil violence. Mass slavery also contributed to three Servile Wars. Tensions at home coupled with ambitions abroad led to further civil wars. The first involved Marius and Sulla. After a generation, the Republic fell into civil war again in 49 BC between Julius Caesar and Pompey. Despite his victory and appointment as dictator for life, Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. Caesar&#x27;s heir Octavian and lieutenant Mark Antony defeated Caesar&#x27;s assassins in 42 BC, but they eventually split. Antony&#x27;s defeat alongside his ally and lover Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and the Senate&#x27;s grant of extraordinary powers to Octavian as in 27 BC—which effectively made him the first Roman emperor—marked the end of the Republic.
==History==

===Founding===

Rome had been ruled by monarchs since its foundation. These monarchs were elected, for life, by the men of the Roman Senate. The last Roman monarch was called Tarquin the Proud, who in traditional histories was expelled from Rome in 509 BC because his son, Sextus Tarquinius, raped a noblewoman, Lucretia. The tradition asserted that the monarchy was abolished in a revolution led by the semi-mythical Lucius Junius Brutus and the king&#x27;s powers were then transferred to two separate consuls elected to office for a term of one year; each was capable of checking his colleague by . Most modern scholarship describes these accounts as the quasi-mythological detailing of an aristocratic coup within Tarquin&#x27;s own family or a consequence of an Etruscan occupation of Rome rather than a popular revolution.

===Rome in Latium===
====Early campaigns====

According to Rome&#x27;s traditional histories, Tarquin made several attempts to retake the throne, including the Tarquinian conspiracy, which involved Brutus&#x27;s own sons, the war with Veii and Tarquinii, and finally the war between Rome and Clusium. The attempts to restore the monarchy did not succeed.

The first Roman republican wars were wars of expansion. One by one, Rome defeated both the persistent Sabines and the local cities. Rome defeated its rival Latin cities in the Battle of Lake Regillus in 496 BC, the Battle of Ariccia in 495 BC, the Battle of Mount Algidus in 458 BC, and the Battle of Corbio in 446 BC. But it suffered a significant defeat at the Battle of the Cremera in 477 BC, wherein it fought against the most important Etruscan city, Veii; this defeat was later avenged at the Battle of Veii in 396 BC, wherein Rome destroyed the city. By the end of this period, Rome had effectively completed the conquest of its immediate Etruscan and Latin neighbours and secured its position against the immediate threat posed by the nearby Apennine hill tribes.

====Plebeians and patricians====
Beginning with their revolt against Tarquin, and continuing through the early years of the Republic, Rome&#x27;s patrician aristocrats were the dominant force in politics and society. They initially formed a closed group of about 50 large families, called &quot;gentes&quot;, who monopolised Rome&#x27;s magistracies, state priesthoods, and senior military posts. The most prominent of these families were the Cornelii, Aemilii, Claudii, Fabii, and Valerii. The leading families&#x27; power, privilege and influence derived from their wealth, in particular from their landholdings, their position as patrons, and their numerous clients.

The vast majority of Roman citizens were commoners of various social degrees. They formed the backbone of Rome&#x27;s economy, as smallholding farmers, managers, artisans, traders, and tenants. In wartime, they could be summoned for military service. Most had little direct political influence. During the early Republic, the &quot;plebs&quot; (or plebeians) emerged as a self-organised, culturally distinct group of commoners, with its own internal hierarchy, laws, customs, and interests. Plebeians had no access to high religious and civil office. For the poorest, one of the few effective political tools was their withdrawal of labour and services, in a &quot;secessio plebis&quot;; the first such secession occurred in 494 BC, in protest at the abusive treatment of plebeian debtors by the wealthy during a famine. The patrician Senate was compelled to give them direct access to the written civil and religious laws and to the electoral and political process. To represent their interests, the &quot;plebs&quot; elected tribunes, who were personally sacrosanct, immune to arbitrary arrest by any magistrate, and had veto power over legislation.

====Celtic invasion of Italy====
By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes were invading Italy from the north. The Romans met the Gauls in pitched battle at the Battle of Allia River around 390–387 BC. The battle was fought at the confluence of the Tiber and Allia rivers, 11 Roman miles () north of Rome. The Romans were routed and subsequently Rome was sacked by the Senones. There is no destruction layer at Rome around this time, indicating that if a sack occurred, it was largely superficial.

===Roman expansion in Italy===
====Wars against Italian neighbours====

From 343 to 341 BC, Rome won two battles against its Samnite neighbours, but was unable to consolidate its gains, due to the outbreak of war with former Latin allies. In the Latin War (340–338 BC), Rome defeated a coalition of Latins at the battles of Vesuvius and the Trifanum. The Latins submitted to Roman rule.

A Second Samnite War began in 327 BC. The war ended with Samnite defeat at the Battle of Bovianum in 305 BC. By 304 BC, Rome had annexed most Samnite territory and begun to establish colonies there, but in 298 BC the Samnites rebelled, and defeated a Roman army, in a Third Samnite War. After this success, it built a coalition of several previous enemies of Rome. The war ended with Roman victory in 290 BC.

At the Battle of Populonia, in 282 BC, Rome finished off the last vestiges of Etruscan power in the region.
====Rise of the plebeian nobility====
In the 4th century, plebeians gradually obtained political equality with patricians. The first plebeian consular tribunes were elected in 400. The reason behind this sudden gain is unknown, but it was limited as patrician tribunes retained preeminence over their plebeian colleagues. In 385 BC, the former consul and saviour of the besieged capital, Marcus Manlius Capitolinus, is said to have sided with the plebeians, ruined by the sack and largely indebted to patricians. According to Livy, Capitolinus sold his estate to repay the debt of many of them, and even went over to the plebs, the first patrician to do so. Nevertheless, the growing unrest he had caused led to his trial for seeking kingly power; he was sentenced to death and thrown from the Tarpeian Rock.

Between 376 BC and 367 BC, the tribunes of the plebs Gaius Licinius Stolo and Lucius Sextius Lateranus continued the plebeian agitation and pushed for an ambitious legislation, known as the &quot;Leges Liciniae Sextiae&quot;. The most important bill opened the consulship to plebeians. Other tribunes controlled by the patricians vetoed the bills, but Stolo and Lateranus retaliated by vetoing the elections for five years while being continuously reelected by the plebs, resulting in a stalemate. In 367 BC, they carried a bill creating the &quot;Decemviri sacris faciundis&quot;, a college of ten priests, of whom five had to be plebeians, thereby breaking patricians&#x27; monopoly on priesthoods. The resolution of the crisis came from the dictator Camillus, who made a compromise with the tribunes: he agreed to their bills, and they in return consented to the creation of the offices of praetor and curule aediles, both reserved to patricians. Lateranus became the first plebeian consul in 366 BC; Stolo followed in 361 BC.

Soon after, plebeians were able to hold both the dictatorship and the censorship. The four-time consul Gaius Marcius Rutilus became the first plebeian dictator in 356 BC and censor in 351 BC. In 342 BC, the tribune of the plebs Lucius Genucius passed his &quot;leges Genuciae&quot;, which abolished interest on loans, in a renewed effort to tackle indebtedness; required the election of at least one plebeian consul each year; and prohibited magistrates from holding the same magistracy for the next ten years or two magistracies in the same year. In 339 BC, the plebeian consul and dictator Quintus Publilius Philo passed three laws extending the plebeians&#x27; powers. His first law followed the &quot;lex Genucia&quot; by reserving one censorship to plebeians, the second made plebiscites binding on all citizens (including patricians), and the third required the Senate to give its prior approval to plebiscites before they became binding on all citizens.

During the early Republic, consuls chose senators from among their supporters. Shortly before 312 BC, the &quot;lex Ovinia&quot; transferred this power to the censors, who could only remove senators for misconduct, thus appointing them for life. This law strongly increased the power of the Senate, which was by now protected from the influence of the consuls and became the central organ of government. In 312 BC, following this law, the patrician censor Appius Claudius Caecus appointed many more senators to fill the new limit of 300, including descendants of freedmen, which was deemed scandalous. Caecus also launched a vast construction programmee, building the first aqueduct, the &quot;Aqua Appia&quot;, and the first Roman road, the &quot;Via Appia&quot;.

In 300 BC, the two tribunes of the plebs Gnaeus and Quintus Ogulnius passed the &quot;lex Ogulnia&quot;, which created four plebeian pontiffs, equalling the number of patrician pontiffs, and five plebeian augurs, outnumbering the four patricians in the college. The Conflict of the Orders ended with the last secession of the plebs around 287. The dictator Quintus Hortensius passed the &quot;lex Hortensia&quot;, which reenacted the law of 339 BC, making plebiscites binding on all citizens, while also removing the requirement for prior Senate approval. These events were a political victory of the wealthy plebeian elite, who exploited the economic difficulties of the plebs for their own gain: Stolo, Lateranus, and Genucius bound their bills attacking patricians&#x27; political supremacy with debt-relief measures. As a result of the end of the patrician monopoly on senior magistracies, many small patrician &quot;gentes&quot; faded into history during the 4th and 3rd centuries BC due to the lack of available positions. About a dozen remaining patrician &quot;gentes&quot; and 20 plebeian ones thus formed a new elite, called the &quot;nobiles&quot;, or &quot;Nobilitas&quot;.

====Pyrrhic War====


By the early 3rd century BC, Rome had established itself as the major power in Italy, but had not yet come into conflict with the dominant military powers of the Mediterranean: Carthage and the Greek kingdoms. In 282, several Roman warships entered the harbour of Tarentum, triggering a violent reaction from the Tarentine democrats, who sank some. The Roman embassy sent to investigate the affair was insulted and war was promptly declared. Facing a hopeless situation, the Tarentines (together with the Lucanians and Samnites) appealed to Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, for military aid. A cousin of Alexander the Great, he was eager to build an empire for himself in the western Mediterranean and saw Tarentum&#x27;s plea as a perfect opportunity.

Pyrrhus and his army of 25,500 men (with 20 war elephants) landed in the Italian peninsula in 280 BC. The Romans were defeated at Heraclea, as their cavalry were afraid of Pyrrhus&#x27;s elephants. Pyrrhus then marched on Rome, but the Romans concluded a peace in the north and moved south with reinforcements, placing Pyrrhus in danger of being flanked by two consular armies; Pyrrhus withdrew to Tarentum. In 279 BC, Pyrrhus met the consuls Publius Decius Mus and Publius Sulpicius Saverrio at the Battle of Asculum, which remained undecided for two days. Finally, Pyrrhus personally charged into the melee and won the battle but at the cost of an important part of his troops; he allegedly said, &quot;if we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined.&quot;

He escaped the Italian deadlock by answering a call for help from Syracuse, where tyrant Thoenon was desperately fighting an invasion from Carthage. Pyrrhus could not let them take the whole island, as it would have compromised his ambitions in the western Mediterranean, and so declared war. The Carthaginians lifted the siege of Syracuse before his arrival, but he could not entirely oust them from the island as he failed to take their fortress of Lilybaeum. His harsh rule soon led to widespread antipathy among the Sicilians; some cities even defected to Carthage. In 275 BC, Pyrrhus left the island before he had to face a full-scale rebellion. He returned to Italy, where his Samnite allies were on the verge of losing the war. Pyrrhus again met the Romans at the Battle of Beneventum. This time, the consul Manius Dentatus was victorious and even captured eight elephants. Pyrrhus then withdrew from Italy, but left a garrison in Tarentum, to wage a new campaign in Greece against Antigonus II Gonatas of Macedonia. His death in battle at Argos in 272 BC forced Tarentum to surrender to Rome.

=== Punic Wars and expansion in the Mediterranean ===

====First Punic War (264–241 BC)====

Rome and Carthage were initially on friendly terms, lastly in an alliance against Pyrrhus, but tensions rapidly rose after the departure of the Epirote king. Between 288 and 283 BC, Messina in Sicily was taken by the Mamertines, a band of mercenaries formerly employed by Agathocles. They plundered the surroundings until Hiero II, the new tyrant of Syracuse, defeated them (in either 269 or 265 BC). In effect under a Carthaginian protectorate, the remaining Mamertines appealed to Rome to regain their independence. Senators were divided on whether to help. A supporter of war, the consul Appius Claudius Caudex, turned to one of the popular assemblies to get a favourable vote by promising plunder to the voters. After the assembly ratified an alliance with the Mamertines, Caudex was dispatched to cross the strait and lend aid.
Messina fell under Roman control quickly. Syracuse and Carthage, at war for centuries, responded with an alliance to counter the invasion and blockaded Messina, but Caudex defeated Hiero and Carthage separately. His successor, Manius Valerius Maximus, landed with an army of 40,000 men and conquered eastern Sicily, which prompted Hiero to shift his allegiance and forge a long-lasting alliance with Rome. In 262 BC, the Romans moved to the southern coast and besieged Akragas. In order to raise the siege, Carthage sent reinforcements, including 60 elephants—the first time they used them—but still lost the battle. Nevertheless, Rome could not take all of Sicily because Carthage&#x27;s naval superiority prevented it from effectively besieging coastal cities. Using a captured Carthaginian ship as blueprint, Rome therefore launched a massive construction programme and built 100 quinqueremes in only two months. It also invented a new device, the &quot;corvus&quot;, a grappling engine that enabled a crew to board an enemy ship. The consul for 260 BC, Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina, lost the first naval skirmish of the war against Hannibal Gisco at Lipara, but his colleague Gaius Duilius won a great victory at Mylae. He destroyed or captured 44 ships and was the first Roman to receive a naval triumph, which also included captive Carthaginians for the first time. Although Carthage was victorious on land at Thermae in Sicily, the &quot;corvus&quot; gave a strong advantage to Rome on the waters. The consul Lucius Cornelius Scipio (Asina&#x27;s brother) captured Corsica in 259 BC; his successors won the naval battles of Sulci in 258, Tyndaris in 257 BC, and Cape Ecnomus in 256.
To hasten the end of the war, the consuls for 256 BC decided to carry the operations to Africa, on Carthage&#x27;s homeland. The consul Marcus Atilius Regulus landed on the Cap Bon peninsula with about 18,000 soldiers. He captured the city of Aspis, repulsed Carthage&#x27;s counterattack at Adys, and took Tunis. The Carthaginians hired Spartan mercenaries, led by Xanthippus, to command their troops. In 255, the Spartan general marched on Regulus, crushing the Roman infantry on the Bagradas plain; only 2,000 soldiers escaped, and Regulus was captured. The consuls for 255 nonetheless won a naval victory at Cape Hermaeum, where they captured 114 warships. This success was spoilt by a storm that annihilated the victorious navy: 184 ships of 264 sank, 25,000 soldiers and 75,000 rowers drowned. The &quot;corvus&quot; considerably hindered ships&#x27; navigation and made them vulnerable during tempest. It was abandoned after another similar catastrophe in 253 BC. These disasters prevented any significant campaign between 254 and 252 BC.
Hostilities in Sicily resumed in 252 BC, with Rome&#x27;s taking of Thermae. The next year, Carthage besieged Lucius Caecilius Metellus, who held Panormos (now Palermo). The consul had dug trenches to counter the elephants, which once hurt by missiles turned back on their own army, resulting in a great victory for Metellus. Rome then besieged the last Carthaginian strongholds in Sicily, Lilybaeum and Drepana, but these cities were impregnable by land. Publius Claudius Pulcher, the consul of 249, recklessly tried to take the latter from the sea, but suffered a terrible defeat; his colleague Lucius Junius Pullus likewise lost his fleet off Lilybaeum. Without the &quot;corvus&quot;, Roman warships had lost their advantage. By now, both sides were drained and could not undertake large-scale operations. The only military activity during this period was the landing in Sicily of Hamilcar Barca in 247 BC, who harassed the Romans with a mercenary army from a citadel he built on Mt. Eryx.

Unable to take the Punic fortresses in Sicily, Rome tried to decide the war at sea and built a new navy, thanks to a forced borrowing from the rich. In 242 BC, 200 quinqueremes under consul Gaius Lutatius Catulus blockaded Drepana. The rescue fleet from Carthage was soundly defeated by Catulus. Exhausted and unable to bring supplies to Sicily, Carthage sued for peace. Carthage had to pay 1,000 talents immediately and 2,200 over ten years and evacuate Sicily. The fine was so high that Carthage could not pay Hamilcar&#x27;s mercenaries, who had been shipped back to Africa. They revolted during the Mercenary War, which Carthage suppressed with enormous difficulty. Meanwhile, Rome took advantage of a similar revolt in Sardinia to seize the island from Carthage, in violation of the peace treaty. This led to permanent bitterness in Carthage.

====Second Punic War====


After its victory, the Republic shifted its attention to its northern border as the Insubres and Boii were threatening Italy. Meanwhile, Carthage compensated the loss of Sicily and Sardinia with the conquest of Southern Hispania (up to Salamanca), and its rich silver mines. This rapid expansion worried Rome, which concluded a treaty with Hasdrubal in 226, stating that Carthage could not cross the Ebro river. But the city of Saguntum, south of the Ebro, appealed to Rome in 220 to act as arbitrator during a period of internal strife. Hannibal took the city in 219, triggering the Second Punic War.

Initially, the Republic&#x27;s plan was to carry war outside Italy, sending the consuls P. Cornelius Scipio to Hispania and Ti. Sempronius Longus to Africa, while their naval superiority prevented Carthage from attacking from the sea. This plan was thwarted by Hannibal&#x27;s bold move to Italy. In May 218, he crossed the Ebro with a large army of about 100,000 soldiers and 37 elephants. He passed in Gaul, crossed the Rhone, then the Alps, possibly through the Col de Clapier. This exploit cost him almost half of his troops, but he could now rely on the Boii and Insubres, still at war with Rome. Publius Scipio, who had failed to block Hannibal on the Rhone, sent his elder brother Gnaeus with the main part of his army in Hispania according to the initial plan, and went back to Italy with the rest to resist Hannibal in Italy, but he was defeated and wounded near the Ticino river.
Hannibal then marched south and won three outstanding victories. The first one was on the banks of the Trebia in December 218, where he defeated the other consul Ti. Sempronius Longus. More than half the Roman army was lost. Hannibal then ravaged the country around Arretium to lure the new consul C. Flaminius into a trap at Lake Trasimene. This clever ambush resulted in the death of the consul and the complete destruction of his army of 30,000 men. In 216, the new consuls L. Aemilius Paullus and C. Terentius Varro mustered the biggest army possible, with eight legions—some 80,000 soldiers, twice as many as the Punic army—and confronted Hannibal, who was encamped at Cannae, in Apulia. Despite his numerical disadvantage, Hannibal used his heavier cavalry to rout the Roman wings and envelop their infantry, which he annihilated. In terms of casualties, the Battle of Cannae was the worst defeat in Roman history: only 14,500 soldiers escaped, and Paullus was killed as well as 80 senators. Soon after, the Boii ambushed the army of the consul-elect for 215, L. Postumius Albinus, who died with all his army of 25,000 men in the Battle of Silva Litana.

These disasters triggered a wave of defection among Roman allies, with the rebellions of the Samnites, Oscans, Lucanians, and Greek cities of Southern Italy. In Macedonia, Philip V also made an alliance with Hannibal in order to take Illyria and the area around Epidamnus, occupied by Rome. His attack on Apollonia started the First Macedonian War. In 215, Hiero II of Syracuse died of old age, and his young grandson Hieronymus broke the long alliance with Rome to side with Carthage. At this desperate point, the aggressive strategy against Hannibal the Scipiones advocated was abandoned in favour of a slow reconquest of the lost territories, since Hannibal could not be everywhere to defend them. Although he remained invincible on the battlefield, defeating all the Roman armies on his way, he could not prevent Claudius Marcellus from taking Syracuse in 212 after a long siege, nor the fall of his bases of Capua and Tarentum in 211 and 209.

In Hispania, Publius and Gnaeus Scipio won the battles of Cissa in 218, soon after Hannibal&#x27;s departure, and Dertosa against his brother Hasdrubal in 215, which enabled them to conquer the eastern coast of Hispania. But in 211, Hasdrubal and Mago Barca successfully turned the Celtiberian tribes that supported the Scipiones, and attacked them simultaneously at the Battle of the Upper Baetis, in which the Scipiones died. Publius&#x27;s son, the future Scipio Africanus, was then elected with a special proconsulship to lead the Hispanic campaign, winning a series of battles with ingenious tactics. In 209, he took Carthago Nova, the main Punic base in Hispania. The next year, he defeated Hasdrubal at the Battle of Baecula. After his defeat, Carthage ordered Hasdrubal to reinforce his brother in Italy. Since he could not use ships, he followed the same route as his brother through the Alps, but the consuls M. Livius Salinator and C. Claudius Nero were awaiting him and defeated him in the Battle of the Metaurus, where Hasdrubal died. It was the turning point of the war. The campaign of attrition had worked well: Hannibal&#x27;s troops were now depleted; he only had one elephant left (Surus) and retreated to Bruttium, on the defensive. In Greece, Rome contained Philip V without devoting too many forces by allying with the Aetolian League, Sparta, and Pergamon, which also prevented Philip from aiding Hannibal. The war with Macedon resulted in a stalemate, with the Treaty of Phoenice signed in 205.

In Hispania, Scipio continued his successful campaign at the battles of Carmona in 207, and Ilipa (now Seville) in 206, which ended the Punic threat on the peninsula. Elected consul in 205, he convinced the Senate to invade Africa with the support of the Numidian king Masinissa, who had defected to Rome. Scipio landed in Africa in 204. He took Utica and then won the Battle of the Great Plains, which prompted Carthage to open peace negotiations. The talks failed because Scipio wanted to impose harsher terms on Carthage to prevent it from rising again as a threat. Hannibal was therefore sent to face Scipio at Zama. Scipio could now use the heavy Numidian cavalry of Massinissa—which had hitherto been so successful against Rome—to rout the Punic wings, then flank the infantry, as Hannibal had done at Cannae. Defeated for the first time, Hannibal convinced the Carthaginian Senate to pay the war indemnity, which was even harsher than that of 241: 10,000 talents in 50 instalments. Carthage also had to give up all its elephants, all its fleet but ten triremes, and all its possessions outside its core territory in Africa (what is now Tunisia), and it could not declare war without Roman authorisation. In effect, Carthage was condemned to be a minor power, while Rome recovered from a desperate situation to dominate the western Mediterranean.

====Roman supremacy in the Greek East====
Rome&#x27;s preoccupation with its war with Carthage provided an opportunity for Philip V of Macedonia, in the north of the Greek peninsula, to attempt to extend his power westward. He sent ambassadors to Hannibal&#x27;s camp in Italy, to negotiate an alliance as common enemies of Rome. But Rome discovered the agreement when Philip&#x27;s emissaries were captured by a Roman fleet. The First Macedonian War saw the Romans involved directly in only limited land operations, but they achieved their objective of occupying Philip and preventing him from aiding Hannibal.

The past century had seen the Greek world dominated by the three primary successor kingdoms of Alexander the Great&#x27;s empire: Ptolemaic Egypt, Macedonia and the Seleucid Empire. In 202, internal problems led to a weakening of Egypt&#x27;s position, disrupting the power balance among the successor states. Macedonia and the Seleucid Empire agreed to an alliance to conquer and divide Egypt. Fearing this increasingly unstable situation, several small Greek kingdoms sent delegations to Rome to seek an alliance. Rome gave Philip an ultimatum to cease his campaigns against Rome&#x27;s new Greek allies. Doubting Rome&#x27;s strength, Philip ignored the request, and Rome sent an army of Romans and Greek allies, beginning the Second Macedonian War. In 197, the Romans decisively defeated Philip at the Battle of Cynoscephalae, and Philip was forced to give up his recent Greek conquests. The Romans declared the &quot;Peace of the Greeks&quot;, believing that Philip&#x27;s defeat now meant that Greece would be stable, and pulled out of Greece entirely.

With Egypt and Macedonia weakened, the Seleucid Empire made increasingly aggressive and successful attempts to conquer the entire Greek world. Now not only Rome&#x27;s allies against Philip, but even Philip himself, sought a Roman alliance against the Seleucids. The situation was exacerbated by the fact that Hannibal was now a chief military advisor to the Seleucid emperor, and the two were believed to be planning outright conquest not just of Greece, but also of Rome. The Seleucids were much stronger than the Macedonians had ever been, because they controlled much of the former Persian Empire and had almost entirely reassembled Alexander the Great&#x27;s former empire.

Fearing the worst, the Romans began a major mobilisation, all but pulling out of recently conquered Spain and Gaul. This fear was shared by Rome&#x27;s Greek allies, who now followed Rome again for the first time since that war. A major Roman-Greek force was mobilised under the command of the great hero of the Second Punic War, Scipio Africanus, and set out for Greece, beginning the Roman–Seleucid War. After initial fighting that revealed serious Seleucid weaknesses, the Seleucids tried to turn the Roman strength against them at the Battle of Thermopylae, but were forced to evacuate Greece. The Romans pursued the Seleucids by crossing the Hellespont, the first time a Roman army had ever entered Asia. The decisive engagement was fought at the Battle of Magnesia, resulting in complete Roman victory. The Seleucids sued for peace, and Rome forced them to give up their recent Greek conquests. Rome again withdrew from Greece, assuming (or hoping) that the lack of a major Greek power would ensure a stable peace. In fact, it did the opposite.

====Conquest of Greece====


In 179, Philip died. His talented and ambitious son, Perseus, took the throne and showed a renewed interest in conquering Greece. With its Greek allies facing a major new threat, Rome declared war on Macedonia again, starting the Third Macedonian War. Perseus initially had some success against the Romans, but Rome responded by sending a stronger army which decisively defeated the Macedonians at the Battle of Pydna in 168. The Macedonians capitulated, ending the war.

Convinced now that the Greeks (and therefore the rest of the region) would not have peace if left alone, Rome decided to establish its first permanent foothold in the Greek world, and divided Macedonia into four client republics. Yet Macedonian agitation continued. The Fourth Macedonian War, 150 to 148 BC, was fought against a Macedonian pretender to the throne who was again destabilising Greece by trying to reestablish the old kingdom. The Romans swiftly defeated the Macedonians at the second battle of Pydna.

The Achaean League, seeing the direction of Roman policy trending towards direct administration, met at Corinth and declared war &quot;nominally against Sparta but in reality, against Rome&quot;. It was swiftly defeated: in 146, the same year as the destruction of Carthage, Corinth was besieged and destroyed, forcing the league&#x27;s surrender. Rome decided to divide the Greek territories into two new, directly administered Roman provinces, Achaea and Macedonia.

====Third Punic War====

For Carthage, the Third Punic War was a simple punitive mission after the neighbouring Numidians allied to Rome robbed and attacked Carthaginian merchants. Treaties had forbidden any war with Roman allies; viewing defence against banditry as &quot;war action&quot;, Rome decided to annihilate Carthage. Carthage was almost defenceless, and submitted when besieged. But the Romans demanded complete surrender and removal of the city into the desert hinterland, far from any coastal or harbour region; the Carthaginians refused. The city was besieged and completely destroyed. Rome acquired all of Carthage&#x27;s North African and Iberian territories. The Romans rebuilt Carthage 100 years later as a Roman colony, by order of Julius Caesar. It flourished, becoming one of the most important cities in the Roman Empire.

===Social troubles and first civil war===
Views on the structural causes of the Republic&#x27;s collapse differ. One enduring thesis is that Rome&#x27;s expansion destabilised its social organisation between conflicting interests; the Senate&#x27;s policymaking, blinded by its own short-term self-interest, alienated large portions of society, who then joined powerful generals who sought to overthrow the system. Two other theses have challenged this view. The first blames the Romans&#x27; inability to conceive of plausible alternatives to the traditional republican system in a &quot;crisis without alternative&quot;. The second instead stresses the continuity of the republic: until its disruption by Caesar&#x27;s civil war and the following two decades of civil war created conditions for autocratic rule and made return to republican politics impossible: and, per Erich S. Gruen, &quot;civil war caused the fall of the republic, not vice versa&quot;.

A core cause of the Republic&#x27;s eventual demise was the loss of elite&#x27;s cohesion from : the ancient sources called this moral decay from wealth and the hubris of Rome&#x27;s domination of the Mediterranean. Modern sources have proposed multiple reasons why the elite lost cohesion, including wealth inequality and a growing willingness by aristocrats to transgress political norms, especially in the aftermath of the Social War.

====Gracchan period====

In the winter of 138–137 BC, a first slave uprising, known as the First Servile War, broke out in Sicily. After initial successes, the slaves led by Eunus and Cleon were defeated by Marcus Perperna and Publius Rupilius in 132 BC.

In this context, Tiberius Gracchus was elected plebeian tribune in 133 BC. He attempted to enact a law to limit the amount of land anyone could own and establish a commission to distribute public lands to poor rural plebs. The aristocrats, who stood to lose an enormous amount of money, bitterly opposed this proposal. Tiberius submitted this law to the Plebeian Council, but it was vetoed by fellow tribune Marcus Octavius. Tiberius induced the plebs to depose Octavius from his office on the grounds that Octavius acted contrary to the manifest will of the people, a position that was unprecedented and constitutionally dubious. His law was enacted and took effect, but, when Tiberius ostentatiously stood for reelection to the tribunate, he was murdered by his enemies.

Tiberius&#x27;s brother Gaius was elected tribune ten years later in 123 and reelected for 122. He induced the plebs to reinforce rights of appeal to the people against capital extrajudicial punishments and institute reforms to improve the people&#x27;s welfare. While ancient sources tend to &quot;conceive Gracchus&#x27; legislation as an elaborate plot against the authority of the Senate... he showed no sign of wanting to replace the Senate in its normal functions&quot;. Amid wide-ranging and popular reforms to create grain subsidies, change jury pools, establish and require the Senate to assign provinces before elections, Gaius proposed a law that would grant citizenship rights to Rome&#x27;s Italian allies. He stood for election to a third term in 121 but was defeated. During violent protests over repeal of an ally&#x27;s colonisation bill, the Senate moved the first against him, resulting in his death, with many others, on the Aventine. His legislation (like that of his brother) survived; the Roman aristocracy disliked the Gracchan agitation but accepted their policies.

In 121, the province of Gallia Narbonensis was established after the victory of Quintus Fabius Maximus over a coalition of Arverni and Allobroges in southern Gaul in 123. Lucius Licinius Crassus founded the city of Narbo there in 118.

====Rise of Marius====

Rome fought the Jugurthine War from 111 to 104 BC against the North African kingdom of Numidia (in what is now Algeria and Tunisia). In 118, its king, Micipsa, died, and an illegitimate son, Jugurtha, usurped the throne. Numidia had been a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars. Initially, Rome mediated a division of the country. But Jugurtha renewed his offensive, leading to a long and inconclusive war with Rome. Gaius Marius was a legate under the consul directing the war and was elected consul in 107 BC over the objections of the aristocratic senators, relying on support from the businessmen and poor. Marius had the Numidian command reassigned to himself through the popular assembly and, with the capture of Jugurtha at the end of a long campaign, ended the war; in the aftermath, the Romans largely withdrew from the province after installing a client king. Marius&#x27;s victory played on existing themes of senatorial corruption and incompetence, contrasted especially against the military failure of senatorial leadership in the Cimbrian War.

The Cimbrian War (113–101) was a far more serious affair than the earlier Gallic clashes in 121. The Germanic tribes of the Cimbri and the Teutons migrated from northern Europe into Rome&#x27;s northern territories, and clashed with Rome and its allies. The defeat of various aristocrats in the conflict, along with Marius&#x27;s reputation for military victory, led to his holding five successive consulships with little to enable him to lead armies against the threat. At the Battle of Aquae Sextiae and the Battle of Vercellae, Marius led the Roman armies, which virtually annihilated both tribes, ending the threat.

During the Cimbrian War, further conflicts embroiled the Republic: A Second Servile War waged in Sicily from 104 to 101; a campaign was waged against pirates in Cilicia; Rome campaigned in Thrace, adding lands to the province of Macedonia; and Lycaonia was annexed to Rome.

====First civil wars====


In 91, the Social War broke out between Rome and its former allies in Italy: the main causes of the war were Roman encroachment on allied lands due to the Republic&#x27;s land redistribution programmes, harsh Roman treatment of the non-citizen allies, and Roman unwillingness to share in the spoils of the empire. After the assassination, in Rome, of a conservative tribune who sought to grant the Italians citizenship, the allies took up arms: most ancient writers explain the conflict in terms of demands for full citizenship, but contemporary rebel propaganda coins indicate it may have been a primarily anti-Roman secessionist movement. The Romans were able to stave off military defeat by conceding the main point almost immediately, tripling the number of citizens. More recent scholarship also has stressed the importance of the war on the allies in destabilising Roman military affairs by blurring the distinction between Romans and foreign enemies.

Further civil conflict emerged, starting in 88. One of the consuls that year, L. Cornelius Sulla, was assigned to take an army against the Pontic king Mithridates. The local governor there was defeated, but C. Marius induced a tribune to promulgate legislation reassigning Sulla&#x27;s command to Marius. Sulla responded by suborning his army, marching on Rome (the city was undefended but politically outraged), and declaring Marius and 11 of his allies outlaws before departing east to war with Mithridates. Marius, who had escaped into exile, returned, and with L. Cornelius Cinna, took control of the city.

After the Marians took control of the city, they started to purge their political enemies. They elected, in irregular fashion, Marius and Cinna to the consulship of 86 BC. Marius died a fortnight after assuming office. Cinna took control of the state: his policies are unclear and the record is muddled by Sulla&#x27;s eventual victory. The Cinnan regime declared Sulla a public enemy and ostensibly replaced him in command in the east. Instead of cooperating with his replacement, which Sulla viewed as illegitimate, he made peace with Mithridates and prepared to return to Italy. By 85 BC, the Cinnans in Rome started preparations to defend the peninsula from invasion.

In 83, he returned from the east with a small but experienced army. Initial reactions were negative across the peninsula, but after winning a number of victories he was able to overcome resistance and capture the city. In the Battle of the Colline Gate, just outside Rome, Sulla&#x27;s army defeated the Marian defenders and then proceeded to &quot;run riot... killing for profit, pleasure, or personal vengeance anyone they pleased&quot;. He then instituted procedures to centralise the killing, creating lists of proscribed persons who could be killed for their property without punishment. After establishing political control, Sulla had himself made dictator and passed a series of constitutional reforms intended to strengthen the position of the magistrates and the senate in the state and replace custom with new rigid statute laws enforced by new permanent courts. Sulla resigned the dictatorship in 81 after election as consul for 80. He then retired, and died in 78 BC.

====Sullan republic====

Cn. Pompey Magnus served the Sullan regime during a short conflict triggered by the republic&#x27;s own consul, M. Aemilius Lepidus, in 77 BC and afterwards led troops successfully against the remaining anti-Sullan forces in the Sertorian War; he brought the war successfully to a close in 72 BC. While Pompey was in Spain, the Republic faced agitation both foreign and domestic. The main domestic political struggle was the restoration of tribunician powers stripped during Sulla&#x27;s dictatorship. After rumours of a pact between Sertorius&#x27;s ostensible republic-in-exile, Mithridates, and various Mediterranean pirate groups, the Sullan regime feared encirclement and stepped up efforts against the threats: they reinforced Pompey in Spain and fortified Bithynia. In spring 73 BC, Mithridates did so, invading Bithynia.

In 73, a slave uprising started in southern Italy under Spartacus, a gladiator, who defeated the local Roman garrisons and four legions under the consuls of 72. At the head of some 70,000 men, Spartacus led them in a Third Servile War—they sought freedom by escape from Italy—before being defeated by troops raised by M. Licinius Crassus. Although Pompey and Crassus were rivals, they were elected to a joint consulship in 70. During their consulship, they brought—with little opposition—legislation to dismantle the tribunician disabilities imposed by Sulla&#x27;s constitutional reforms. They also shepherded legislation to settle the contentious matter of jury reform.


L. Licinius Lucullus, one of Sulla&#x27;s ablest lieutenants, had fought against Mithridates during the first Mithridatic war before Sulla&#x27;s civil war. Mithridates also had fought Rome in a second Mithridatic war (83–82 BC). Rome for its part seemed equally eager for war and the spoils and prestige that it might bring. After his invasion of Bithynia in 73, Lucullus was assigned against Mithridates and his Armenian ally Tigranes the Great in Asia Minor. Fighting a war of manoeuvre against Mithridates&#x27; supply lines, Lucullus was able force Mithridates from an attempted siege of Cyzicus and pursue him into Pontus and thence into Armenia. After defeat forced the Romans from large parts of Armenia and Pontus in 67, Lucullus was replaced in command by Pompey. Pompey moved against Mithridates in 66. Defeating him in battle and securing the submission of Tigranes, Mithridates fled to Crimea, where he was betrayed and killed by his son Pharnaces in 63. Pompey remained in the East to pacify and settle Roman conquests in the region, also extending Roman control south to Judaea.

===End of the Republic===

====First Triumvirate====

Pompey returned from the Third Mithridatic War at the end of 62 BC. In the interim, before his return to Italy, the senate had successfully suppressed a conspiracy and insurrection led by a senator, Lucius Sergius Catilina, to overthrow that year&#x27;s consuls. In the aftermath of the conspiracy, which was abetted by popular discontent, the Senate moved legislation to temper unrest in Italy: expanding the grain dole and implementing other reforms. Pompey, landing in Brundisium, publicly dismissed his troops, indicating that he had no desire to follow Sulla&#x27;s example and dominate the republic by force, as some conservative senators had feared. He attempted to have his eastern settlements passed by the Senate; ratification was not forthcoming, due to the opposition of Lucullus, Crassus, and Cato the Younger.

After Julius Caesar&#x27;s election as one of the consuls of 59 BC, Pompey, Caesar, and Crassus engaged in a political alliance (traditionally dubbed by scholars as the First Triumvirate). The alliance greatly benefited the three men: Caesar passed legislation to distribute state lands as poor relief while also providing land for Pompey&#x27;s veterans; he also had Pompey&#x27;s eastern settlements ratified; for Crassus, he secured relief for tax farmers and a place on agrarian commission. Caesar won for himself the political support needed to acquire a profitable provincial command in Gaul and secure his political future.

Attempting first to pass portions of his programme through the Senate, Caesar found the curia obstinate. He thus unveiled his alliance with Pompey and Crassus and moved his legislation before the people instead. Political opposition to the allies was immense.

Caesar also facilitated the election of the former patrician Publius Clodius Pulcher to the tribunate for 58. Clodius set about depriving Caesar&#x27;s senatorial enemies of two of their more obstinate leaders in Cato and Cicero. Clodius attempted to try Cicero for executing citizens without a trial during the Catiline conspiracy, resulting in Cicero going into self-imposed exile. Clodius also passed a bill that forced Cato to lead the invasion of Cyprus, which would keep him away from Rome for some years. Clodius also passed a law to expand the previous partial grain subsidy to a fully free grain dole for citizens.

After his term as consul in 59, Caesar was appointed to a five-year term as the proconsular Governor of Cisalpine Gaul (part of current northern Italy), Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and Illyria (part of the modern Balkans). Caesar sought cause to invade Gaul (modern France and Belgium), which would give him the dramatic military success he sought. When two local tribes began to migrate on a route that would take them near (not into) the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his Gallic Wars, fought between 58 and 49.

Caesar defeated large armies at major battles 58 and 57. In 55 and 54 he made two expeditions into Britain, the first Roman to do so. Caesar then defeated a union of Gauls at the Battle of Alesia, completing the Roman conquest of Transalpine Gaul. By 50, all of Gaul lay in Roman hands.

Clodius formed armed gangs that terrorised the city and eventually began to attack Pompey&#x27;s followers, who in response funded counter-gangs formed by Titus Annius Milo. The political alliance of the triumvirate was crumbling. Domitius Ahenobarbus ran for the consulship in 55, promising to take Caesar&#x27;s command from him. Eventually, the triumvirate was renewed at Lucca. Pompey and Crassus were promised the consulship in 55, and Caesar&#x27;s term as governor was extended for five years. Beginning in the summer of 54, a wave of political corruption and violence swept Rome. This chaos reached a climax in January of 52, when Milo murdered Clodius in a gang war.

In 53, Crassus launched a Roman invasion of the Parthian Empire (modern Iraq and Iran). After initial successes, his army was cut off deep in enemy territory, surrounded and slaughtered at the Battle of Carrhae, in which Crassus himself perished. Crassus&#x27;s death destabilised the Triumvirate. While Caesar was fighting in Gaul, Pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome that revealed that he was at best ambivalent towards Caesar. Pompey&#x27;s wife, Julia, who was Caesar&#x27;s daughter, died in childbirth. This event severed the last remaining bond between Pompey and Caesar. In 51, some Roman senators demanded that Caesar not be permitted to stand for consul unless he turned over control of his armies to the state. Caesar chose civil war over laying down his command and facing trial.

====Caesar&#x27;s civil war and dictatorship====

On 1 January 49, an agent of Caesar presented an ultimatum to the senate. The ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution declaring that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be considered an enemy of the Republic. Meanwhile, the senators adopted Pompey as their new champion against Caesar, passing a that vested Pompey with dictatorial powers. On 10 January, Caesar with his veteran army crossed the river Rubicon, the legal boundary of Roman Italy beyond which no commander might bring his army, in violation of Roman laws, and by the spring of 49 swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome. His rapid advance forced Pompey, the consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece. Caesar entered the city unopposed. Afterwards Caesar turned his attention to the Pompeian stronghold of Hispania (modern Spain) but decided to tackle Pompey himself in Greece. Pompey initially defeated Caesar, but failed to follow up on the victory, and was decisively defeated at the Battle of Pharsalus in 48. Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where he was murdered.

Pompey&#x27;s death did not end the civil war. In 46 Caesar lost perhaps as much as a third of his army, but ultimately came back to defeat the Pompeian army of Metellus Scipio in the Battle of Thapsus, after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Hispania. Caesar then defeated the combined Pompeian forces at the Battle of Munda.

With Pompey defeated and order restored, Caesar wanted to achieve undisputed control over the government. The powers he gave himself were later assumed by his imperial successors. Caesar held both the dictatorship and the tribunate, and alternated between the consulship and the proconsulship. In 48, he was given permanent tribunician powers. This made his person sacrosanct, gave him the power to veto the senate, and allowed him to dominate the Plebeian Council. In 46, Caesar was given censorial powers, which he used to fill the senate with his partisans. He then raised the membership of the Senate to 900. This robbed the senatorial aristocracy of its prestige, and made it increasingly subservient to him. Caesar began to prepare for a war against the Parthian Empire. Since his absence from Rome would limit his ability to install consuls, he passed a law that allowed him to appoint all magistrates, and later all consuls and tribunes. This transformed the magistrates from representatives of the people to representatives of the dictator.

Caesar was now the primary figure of the Roman state, enforcing and entrenching his powers. His enemies feared that he had ambitions to become an autocratic ruler. Arguing that the Roman Republic was in danger, a group of senators led by Gaius Cassius and Marcus Brutus hatched a conspiracy and assassinated Caesar at a meeting of the Senate on 15 March 44. Virtually all the conspirators fled the city after Caesar&#x27;s death in fear of retaliation.

====Second Triumvirate====
The civil wars that followed destroyed what was left of the Republic.

After the assassination, Caesar&#x27;s three most important associates, Mark Antony, Caesar&#x27;s co-consul, Octavian, Caesar&#x27;s adopted son and great-nephew, and Lepidus, Caesar&#x27;s , formed an alliance known as the Second Triumvirate. The conspirators were defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42.

Following Philippi, Rome&#x27;s territories were divided between the triumvirs, but the agreement was fragile. Antony detested Octavian and spent most of his time in the East, while Lepidus favoured Antony but felt himself obscured by his colleagues. Following the defeat of Sextus Pompeius, a dispute between Lepidus and Octavian regarding the allocation of lands broke out and, in 36 BC, Lepidus was forced into exile in Circeii and stripped of all his offices except that of . His former provinces were awarded to Octavian.

Antony, meanwhile, married Caesar&#x27;s lover, Cleopatra of Ptolemaic Egypt, intending to use wealthy Egypt as a base to dominate Rome. The ambitious Octavian built a power base of patronage and then launched a campaign against Antony. Another civil war broke out between Octavian on one hand and Antony and Cleopatra on the other. This culminated in the latter&#x27;s defeat at Actium in 31 BC; Octavian&#x27;s forces then chased Antony and Cleopatra to Alexandria, where they both committed suicide in 30 BC.

Octavian was granted a series of special powers, including sole within the city of Rome, permanent consular powers, and credit for every Roman military victory. In 27, he was granted the use of the name &quot;Augustus&quot;, from which point he is generally considered the first Roman Emperor.

==Constitutional system==

The constitutional history of the Roman Republic began with the revolution that overthrew the monarchy in 509 BC and ended with constitutional reforms that transformed the Republic into what would effectively be the Roman Empire, in 27 BC. The Roman Republic&#x27;s constitution was a constantly evolving, unwritten set of guidelines and principles passed down mainly through precedent, by which the government and its politics operated.

===Senate===


The senate&#x27;s authority derived from the senators&#x27; esteem and prestige. This esteem and prestige were based on both precedent and custom, as well as the senators&#x27; calibre and reputation. The senate passed decrees called . These were officially &quot;advice&quot; from the senate to a magistrate, but in practice, the magistrates usually followed them. Through the course of the middle republic and Rome&#x27;s expansion, the senate became more dominant in the state: the only institution with the expertise to administer the empire effectively, it controlled state finances, assignment of magistrates, external affairs, and deployment of military forces. Also, a powerful religious body, it received reports of omens and directed Roman responses thereto.

When its prerogatives started to be challenged in the 2nd century, the senate lost its customary preapproval for legislation. Moreover, after the precedent set in 121 BC with the killing of Gaius Gracchus, the senate claimed to assume the power to issue a : such decrees directed magistrates to take whatever actions were necessary to safeguard the state, irrespective of legality, and signalled the senate&#x27;s willingness to support that magistrate if such actions were later challenged in the courts.

Its members were usually appointed by censors, who ordinarily selected newly elected magistrates for membership in the senate, making the senate a partially elected body. Status was not hereditary and there were always some new men, though sons of former magistrates found it easier to be elected to the qualifying magistracies. During emergencies, a dictator could be appointed for the purpose of appointing senators (as was done after the Battle of Cannae). However, by the end of the republic men such as Caesar and the members of the Second Triumvirate usurped these powers for themselves.

===Legislative assemblies===

The legal status of Roman citizenship was limited and a vital prerequisite to possessing many important legal rights, such as the right to trial and appeal, marry, vote, hold office, enter binding contracts, and to special tax exemptions. An adult male citizen with the full complement of legal and political rights was called (). Citizens who were elected their assemblies, whereupon the assemblies elected magistrates, enacted legislation, presided over trials in capital cases, declared war and peace, and forged or dissolved treaties. There were two types of legislative assemblies: the (&#x27;committees&#x27;), which were assemblies of all citizens , and the (&quot;councils&quot;), which were assemblies of specific groups of citizens .

Citizens were organised on the basis of centuries and tribes, which each gathered into their own assemblies. The (&#x27;Centuriate Assembly&#x27;) was the assembly of the centuries (that is., soldiers). The Comitia Centuriata&#x27;s president was usually a consul. The centuries voted, one at a time, until a measure received support from a majority. The Comitia Centuriata elected magistrates who had (consuls and praetors). It also elected censors. Only the Comitia Centuriata could declare war and ratify the results of a census. It served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases.

The assembly of the tribes, that is, the citizens of Rome, the Comitia Tributa, was presided over by a consul, and composed of 35 tribes. Once a measure received support from a majority of the tribes, voting ended. While it did not pass many laws, the Comitia Tributa did elect quaestors, curule aediles, and military tribunes. The Plebeian Council was identical to the assembly of the tribes but excluded the patricians. They elected their own officers, plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles. Usually, a plebeian tribune would preside over the assembly. This assembly passed most laws and could act as a court of appeal.

===Magistrates===

Each republican magistrate held certain constitutional powers. Each was assigned a by the Senate. This was the scope of that particular office holder&#x27;s authority. It could apply to a geographic area or to a particular responsibility or task. The powers of a magistrate came from the people of Rome (both plebeians and patricians). was held by both consuls and praetors. Strictly speaking, it was the authority to command a military force, but in reality, it carried broad authority in other public spheres, such as diplomacy and the justice system. In extreme cases, those with the imperium power could sentence Roman Citizens to death. All magistrates also had the power of (coercion). Magistrates used this to maintain public order by imposing punishment for crimes. Magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens. This power could also be used to obstruct political opponents.

One check on a magistrate&#x27;s power was (&#x27;collegiality&#x27;). Each magisterial office was held concurrently by at least two people. Another such check was . While in Rome, all citizens were protected from coercion, by , an early form of due process. It was a precursor to . If any magistrate tried to use the powers of the state against a citizen, that citizen could appeal the magistrate&#x27;s decision to a tribune. In addition, once a magistrate&#x27;s one-year term of office expired, he would have to wait ten years before serving in that office again. This created problems for some consuls and praetors, and these magistrates occasionally had their extended. In effect, they retained the powers of the office (as a promagistrate) without officially holding that office.

In times of military emergency, a dictator was appointed for a term of six months. Constitutional government was dissolved, and the dictator was the absolute master of the state. When the dictator&#x27;s term ended, constitutional government was restored.

The censor was a magistrate in ancient Rome who was responsible for maintaining the census, supervising public morality, and overseeing certain aspects of the government&#x27;s finances. The power of the censor was absolute: no magistrate could oppose his decisions, and only another censor who succeeded him could cancel those decisions. The censor&#x27;s regulation of public morality is the origin of the modern meaning of the words &quot;censor&quot; and &quot;censorship&quot;. During the census, they could enroll citizens in the senate or purge them from the senate.

The consuls of the Roman Republic were the highest-ranking ordinary magistrates. Each served for one year. Consular powers included the kings&#x27; former and appointment of new senators. Consuls had supreme power in both civil and military matters. While in the city of Rome, the consuls were the head of the Roman government. They presided over the senate and the assemblies. While abroad, each consul commanded an army. His authority abroad was nearly absolute.

Since the tribunes were considered the embodiment of the plebeians, they were sacrosanct. Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge the plebeians took to kill anyone who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office. It was a capital offense to harm a tribune, disregard his veto, or otherwise interfere with him.

Praetors administered civil law and commanded provincial armies. Aediles were officers elected to conduct domestic affairs in Rome, such as managing public games and shows. The quaestors usually assisted the consuls in Rome, and the governors in the provinces. Their duties were often financial.

==Military==
Rome&#x27;s military secured Rome&#x27;s territory and borders and helped to impose tribute on conquered peoples. Rome&#x27;s armies had a formidable reputation; but Rome also &quot;produced [its] share of incompetents&quot; and catastrophic defeats. Nevertheless, it was generally the fate of Rome&#x27;s greatest enemies, such as Pyrrhus and Hannibal, to win early battles but lose the war.

===Hoplite armies===

During this period, Roman soldiers seem to have been modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves are believed to have copied their style of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city&#x27;s penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578–534). The phalanx was effective in large, open spaces, but not on the hilly terrain of the central Italian peninsula. In the 4th century, the Romans replaced it with the more flexible manipular formation. This change is sometimes attributed to Marcus Furius Camillus and placed shortly after the Gallic invasion of 390; more likely, it was copied from Rome&#x27;s Samnite enemies to the south.

===Manipular legion===

During this period, an army formation of around 5,000 men (of both heavy and light infantry) was known as a legion. &quot;Maniples&quot; were units of 120 men each drawn from a single infantry class. They were typically deployed into three discrete lines based on the three heavy infantry types:

# The first line maniple was the , infantry soldiers who wore a bronze breastplate and a bronze helmet and carried an iron-clad wooden shield. They were armed with a sword and two throwing spears.
# The second line were the . They were armed and armoured in the same manner as the , but wore a lighter coat of mail.
# The formed the third line. They were the last remnant of the hoplite-style troops in the Roman army. They were armed and armoured like the , but carried a lighter spear.

The three infantry classes may have retained some slight parallel to social divisions within Roman society, but at least officially the three lines were based upon age and experience rather than social class. Young, unproven men served in the first line, older men with some military experience in the second, and veteran troops of advanced age and experience in the third.

The heavy infantry of the maniples was supported by a number of light infantry and cavalry troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion. The cavalry was drawn primarily from the richest class of equestrians. There was an additional class of troops that followed the army without specific martial roles and was deployed to the rear of the third line. Its role in accompanying the army was primarily to supply any vacancies that might occur in the maniples. The light infantry consisted of 1,200 unarmoured skirmishing troops drawn from the youngest and lower social classes. They were armed with a sword, a small shield, and several light javelins.

Rome&#x27;s military confederation with the other peoples of the Italian peninsula meant that half of its army was provided by the Socii. According to Polybius, Rome could draw on 770,000 men at the beginning of the Second Punic War, of which 700,000 were infantry and 70,000 met the requirements for cavalry.

A small navy had operated at a fairly low level after about 300, but it was massively upgraded about 40 years later, during the First Punic War. After a period of frenetic construction, the navy mushroomed to more than 400 ships on the Carthaginian (&quot;Punic&quot;) pattern. Once completed, it could accommodate up to 100,000 sailors and embarked troops for battle. The navy thereafter declined in size.

In 217, near the beginning of the Second Punic War, Rome was forced to effectively ignore its long-standing principle that its soldiers must be both citizens and property owners. Severe social stresses, population decline, and the greater collapse of the middle classes meant that the Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers at the expense of the state, which it had not had to do before. The distinction between the heavy infantry types began to blur, perhaps because the state was now assuming the responsibility of providing standard-issue equipment. In addition, the shortage of available manpower led to a greater burden upon Rome&#x27;s allies for the provision of allied troops. Eventually, the Romans were forced to begin hiring mercenaries to fight alongside the legions.

===Late Republican legions===

The organisation of the legions evolved throughout the Republican period. In 107, all citizens, regardless of their wealth or social class, were made eligible for entry into the Roman army. The distinction among the three heavy infantry classes, which had already blurred, had collapsed into a single class of heavy legionary infantry. The heavy infantry legionaries were drawn from citizen stock, while non-citizens came to dominate the ranks of the light infantry. The army&#x27;s higher-level officers and commanders were still drawn exclusively from the Roman aristocracy. Unlike earlier in the Republic, legionaries were no longer fighting on a seasonal basis to protect their land. Instead, they received standard pay and were employed by the state on a fixed-term basis. As a consequence, military duty began to appeal most to the poorest sections of society, to whom a salaried pay was attractive.

The legions of the late Republic were almost entirely heavy infantry. The main legionary sub-unit was a &quot;cohort&quot; of approximately 480 infantrymen, further divided into six centuries of 80 men each. Each century comprised 10 &quot;tent groups&quot; of eight men. Cavalry were used as scouts and dispatch riders rather than as battlefield forces. Legions also contained a dedicated group of artillery crew of perhaps 60 men. Each legion was normally partnered with an approximately equal number of allied (non-Roman) troops.

The army&#x27;s most obvious deficiency lay in its shortage of cavalry, especially heavy cavalry. Particularly in the East, Rome&#x27;s slow-moving infantry legions were often confronted by fast-moving cavalry troops and found themselves at a tactical disadvantage.

After Rome&#x27;s subjugation of the Mediterranean, its navy declined in size, although it underwent short-term upgrading and revitalisation in the late Republic to meet several new demands. Julius Caesar assembled a fleet to cross the English Channel and invade Britannia. Pompey raised a fleet to deal with the Cilician pirates who threatened Rome&#x27;s Mediterranean trading routes. During the civil war that followed, as many as 1,000 ships were either constructed or pressed into service from Greek cities.

==Social structure==

Citizen families were headed by the family&#x27;s oldest male, the , who was lawfully entitled to exercise complete authority () over family property and all family members. Citizenship offered legal protection and rights, but citizens who offended Rome&#x27;s traditional moral code could be declared infamous and lose certain legal and social privileges. Citizenship was also taxable, and undischarged debt was potentially a capital offence. A form of limited, theoretically voluntary slavery (debt bondage, or nexum) allowed wealthy creditors to negotiate payment of debt through bonded service. Poor, landless citizens of the lowest class () might contract their sons to a creditor, patron or third party employer to obtain an income or pay off family debts. was abolished only when slave labour became more readily available, most notably during the Punic wars.
Slaves could be bought, sold, acquired through warfare, or born and raised in slavery. There were no legal limits on the slave-owner&#x27;s power over them. A few slaves were freed by their owners, becoming freedmen and in some circumstances citizens too. This degree of social mobility was unusual in the ancient world but itself limited; for example, freedmen were seen as permanently tainted, and their children could not become magistrates. Freedmen could play notable roles in various crafts and trades, particularly those who had been manumitted by the upper classes. Freed slaves and the master who freed them retained certain legal and moral mutual obligations.

At the other extreme were the senatorial families of the landowning nobility, both patrician and plebeian, bound by shifting allegiances and mutual competition. A plebiscite of 218 forbade senators and their sons to engage in substantial trade or money-lending. A wealthy equestrian class emerged, not subject to the same trading constraints as senators.

One of Rome&#x27;s fundamental social and economic institutions was the client-patron relationship; its obligations were largely moral and social rather than legal, but permeated society, including in politics.

Citizen men and citizen women were expected to marry, produce as many children as possible, and improve—or at worst, conserve—their family&#x27;s wealth, fortune, and public profile. Marriage offered opportunities for political alliance and social advancement. Patricians usually married in a form known as , which transferred the bride from her father&#x27;s legal control () to that of her husband. Patrician status could be inherited only through birth; an early law, introduced by the reactionary Decemviri but rescinded in 445, sought to prevent marriages between patricians and plebeians. Among ordinary plebeians, different marriage forms offered married women considerable more freedom than their patrician counterparts, until marriage was replaced by &quot;free marriage&quot;, in which the wife remained under her absent father&#x27;s legal authority, not her husband&#x27;s. Infant mortality was high. Towards the end of the Republic, the birthrate began to fall among the elite. Some wealthy, childless citizens resorted to adoption to provide male heirs for their estates and to forge political alliances. Adoption was subject to the senate&#x27;s approval.

==Trade and economy==
===Farming===

The Republic was created during a time of warfare, economic recession, food shortages, and plebeian debt. In wartime, plebeian farmers were liable to conscription. In peacetime, most depended on whatever cereal crops they could produce on small farming plots, allotted to them by the state, or by patrons. Soil fertility varied from place to place, and natural water sources were unevenly distributed. In good years, a small holder might trade a small surplus, to meet his family&#x27;s needs, or to buy the armatures required for his military service. In other years, crop failure through soil exhaustion, adverse weather, disease or military incursions could lead to poverty, unsupported borrowing, and debt. Nobles invested much of their wealth in ever-larger, more efficient farming units, exploiting a range of soil conditions through mixed farming techniques. As farming was labour-intensive, and military conscription reduced the pool of available manpower, over time the wealthy became ever more reliant on the increasingly plentiful slave labour provided by successful military campaigns. Large, well-managed agricultural estates helped provide for clients and dependents, support an urban family home, and fund the owner&#x27;s public and military career, in the form of cash for bribes and security for loans. Later Roman moralists idealised farming as an intrinsically noble occupation.

In law, land taken by conquest was (public land). In practice, much of it was exploited by the nobility, using slaves rather than free labour. Rome&#x27;s expansion via war and colonisation was at least partly driven by the land-hunger of displaced peasants, who must otherwise join the swelling, dependent population of urban &quot;plebs&quot;. At the end of the second Punic War, Rome added the fertile , suitable for intense cultivation of vines, olives and cereals. Like the grain-fields of Sicily—seized after the same conflict—it was likely farmed extra-legally by leading landowners, using slave gangs. A portion of Sicily&#x27;s grain harvest was sent to Rome as tribute, for redistribution by the . The urban &quot;plebs&quot; increasingly relied on firstly subsidised, then free grain.
With the introduction of aqueducts (from 312), suburban market-farms could be supplied with runoff or waste aqueduct water. Perishable commodities such as flowers (for perfumes, and festival garlands), fresh grapes, vegetables and orchard fruits, and small livestock such as pigs and chickens, could be farmed close to municipal and urban markets. Food surpluses, no matter how obtained, kept prices low. Faced with increasing competition from provincial and allied grain suppliers, many Roman farmers turned to more profitable crops, especially grapes for wine production. By the late Republican era, Roman wine had been transformed from an indifferent local product for local consumption to a major domestic and export commodity, with some renowned, costly and collectable vintages.

Roman writers have little to say about large-scale stock-breeding but make passing references to its profitability. Drummond speculates that this focus on agriculture rather than livestock might reflect elite preoccupations with historical grain famines, or long-standing competition between agriculturalists and pastoralists. Though meat and hides were valuable by products of stock-raising, cattle were primarily reared to pull carts and ploughs, and sheep were bred for their wool, the mainstay of the Roman clothing industry. Horses, mules and donkeys were bred as civil and military transport. Pigs bred prolifically and could be raised at little cost by any small farmer with rights to pannage. Their central dietary role is reflected by their use as sacrifices in cults and funerals.

==Religion==


Republican Rome&#x27;s religious practices harked back to Rome&#x27;s quasi-mythical history. Romulus, a son of Mars, founded Rome after Jupiter granted him favourable bird-signs regarding the site. Numa Pompilius, Rome&#x27;s second king, had established its basic religious and political institutions after direct instructions from the gods, given through augury, dreams and oracle. Each king thereafter was credited with some form of divinely approved innovation, adaptation or reform. An Imperial-era source claims that the Republic&#x27;s first consul, Brutus, effectively abolished human sacrifice to the goddess Mania, instituted by the last king, Tarquinius.

Romans acknowledged the existence of innumerable deities who controlled the natural world and human affairs. The Roman state&#x27;s well-being depended on its state deities, whose opinions and will could be discerned by priests and magistrates, trained in augury, haruspicy, oracles and the interpretation of omens. The gods were thought to communicate their wrath (&quot;ira deorum&quot;) through prodigies (unnatural or aberrant phenomena).

Individuals, occupations and locations had their own protective tutelary deity, or several. Each was associated with a particular, highly prescriptive form of prayer and sacrifice. Piety () was the correct, dutiful and timely performance of such actions. The well-being of each Roman household was thought to depend on daily cult to its Lares and Penates (guardian deities, or spirits), ancestors, and the divine generative essence embodied within its &quot;pater familias&quot;. A family which neglected its religious responsibilities could not expect to prosper.

Roman religious authorities were unconcerned with personal beliefs or privately funded cults unless they offended natural or divine laws or undermined the &quot;mos maiorum&quot; (roughly, &quot;the way of the ancestors&quot;); the relationship between gods and mortals should be sober, contractual, and of mutual benefit. Undignified grovelling, excessive enthusiasm (&quot;superstitio&quot;) and secretive practices were &quot;weak-minded&quot; and morally suspect. Magical practices were officially banned, as attempts to subvert the will of the gods for personal gain but were probably common among all classes. Private cult organisations that seemed to threaten Rome&#x27;s political and priestly hierarchy were investigated by the Senate, with advice from the priestly colleges. The Republic&#x27;s most notable religious suppression was that of the Bacchanalia, a widespread, unofficial, enthusiastic cult to the Greek wine-god Bacchus. The cult organisation was ferociously suppressed, and its deity was absorbed within the official cult to Rome&#x27;s own wine god, Liber. The official recognition, adoption and supervision of foreign deities and practices had been an important unitary feature in Rome&#x27;s territorial expansion and dominance since the days of the kings.

===Priesthoods===
With the abolition of monarchy, some of its sacral duties were shared by the consuls, while others passed to a Republican &quot;rex sacrorum&quot; (&quot;king of the sacred rites&quot;), a patrician &quot;king&quot;, elected for life, with great prestige but no executive or kingly powers. Rome had no specifically priestly class or caste. As every family&#x27;s &quot;pater familias&quot; was responsible for his family&#x27;s cult activities, he was effectively the senior priest of his own household. In the early Republic, the patricians, as &quot;fathers&quot; to the Roman people, claimed the right of seniority to lead and control the state&#x27;s relationship with the divine. Patrician families, in particular the &quot;Cornelii&quot;, &quot;Postumii&quot; and &quot;Valerii&quot;, monopolised the leading state priesthoods. The patrician &quot;Flamen Dialis&quot; employed the &quot;greater auspices&quot; (&quot;auspicia maiora&quot;) to consult with Jupiter on significant matters of state.

Twelve &quot;lesser flaminates&quot; (&quot;Flamines minores&quot;) were open to plebeians or reserved to them. They included a &quot;Flamen Cerealis&quot; in service of Ceres, goddess of grain and growth, and protector of plebeian laws and tribunes. The priesthoods of local urban and rustic &quot;Compitalia&quot; street festivals, dedicated to the lares of local communities, were open to freedmen and slaves..
The &quot;Lex Ogulnia&quot; (300) gave patricians and plebeians more-or-less equal representation in the augural and pontifical colleges; other important priesthoods, such as the Quindecimviri (&quot;The Fifteen&quot;), and the &quot;epulones&quot; were opened to any member of the senatorial class. To restrain the accumulation and potential abuse of priestly powers, each &quot;gens&quot; was permitted one priesthood at a time, and the censors monitored the senators&#x27; religious activities. Magistrates who held an augurate could claim divine authority for their position and policies. In the late Republic, augury came under the control of the &quot;pontifices&quot;, whose powers were increasingly woven into the civil and military &quot;cursus honorum&quot;. Eventually, the office of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; became a &quot;de facto&quot; consular prerogative.

Some cults may have been exclusively female; for example, the rites of the Good Goddess (&quot;Bona Dea&quot;). Towards the end of the second Punic War, Rome rewarded priestesses of Demeter from &quot;Graeca Magna&quot; with Roman citizenship for training respectable, leading matrons as &quot;sacerdotes&quot; of &quot;Greek rites&quot; to Ceres. Every matron of a family (the wife of its &quot;pater familias&quot;) had a religious duty to maintain the household fire, which was considered an extension of Vesta&#x27;s sacred fire, tended in perpetuity by the chaste Vestal Virgins. The Vestals also made the sacrificial &quot;mola salsa&quot; employed in many State rituals, and represent an essential link between domestic and state religion. Rome&#x27;s survival was thought to depend on their sacred status and ritual purity.

===Temples and festivals===

Rome&#x27;s major public temples were within the city&#x27;s sacred, augural boundary (&quot;pomerium&quot;), which had supposedly been marked out by Romulus, with Jupiter&#x27;s approval. The Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus (&quot;Jupiter, Best and Greatest&quot;) stood on the Capitoline Hill. Among the settled areas outside the &quot;pomerium&quot; was the nearby Aventine Hill. It was traditionally associated with Romulus&#x27;s unfortunate twin, Remus, and in later history with the Latins, and the Roman &quot;plebs&quot;. The Aventine seems to have functioned as a place for the introduction of &quot;foreign&quot; deities. In 392, Camillus established a temple there to Juno Regina, Etruscan Veii&#x27;s protective goddess. Later introductions include Summanus, 278, Vortumnus 264, and at some time before the end of the 3rd century, Minerva. While Ceres&#x27;s Aventine temple was most likely built at patrician expense, to mollify the &quot;plebs&quot;, the patricians brought the Magna Mater (&quot;Great mother of the Gods&quot;) to Rome as their own &quot;Trojan&quot; ancestral goddess, and installed her on the Palatine.

Romulus was said to have pitched his augural tent atop the Palatine. Beneath its southern slopes ran the sacred way, next to the former palace of the kings (Regia), the House of the Vestals and Temple of Vesta. Close by were the Lupercal shrine and the cave where Romulus and Remus were said to have been suckled by the she-wolf. On the flat area between the Aventine and Palatine was the Circus Maximus, which hosted chariot races and religious games. Its several shrines and temples included those to Rome&#x27;s indigenous sun god, Sol, the moon-goddess Luna, the grain-storage god, Consus, and the obscure goddess Murcia.

Whereas Romans marked the passage of years with the names of their ruling consuls, their calendars marked the anniversaries of religious foundations to particular deities, the days when official business was permitted (&quot;fas&quot;), and those when it was not (&quot;nefas&quot;). The Romans observed an eight-day week; law courts were closed and markets were held on the ninth day. Each month was presided over by a particular, usually major deity. The oldest calendars were lunar.

===In the military===

Before any campaign or battle, Roman commanders took auspices, or haruspices, to seek the gods&#x27; opinion regarding the likely outcome. Military success was achieved through a combination of personal and collective &quot;virtus&quot; (roughly, &quot;manly virtue&quot;) and divine will. Triumphal generals dressed as Jupiter Capitolinus and laid their victor&#x27;s laurels at his feet. Religious negligence, or lack of &quot;virtus&quot;, provoked divine wrath and led to military disaster. Military oaths dedicated the oath-takers life to Rome&#x27;s gods and people; defeated soldiers were expected to take their own lives, rather than survive as captives. Examples of &quot;devotio&quot;, as performed by the Decii Mures, in which soldiers offered and gave their lives to the &quot;Di inferi&quot; (gods of the underworld) in exchange for Roman victory were celebrated as the highest good.

==Cities, towns and villas==
===City of Rome===
Life in the Roman Republic revolved around the city of Rome. The most important governing, administrative and religious institutions were concentrated at its heart, on and around the Capitoline and Palatine Hills. The city rapidly outgrew its original sacred boundary (&quot;pomerium&quot;), and its first city walls. Rome&#x27;s first aqueduct (312), built during the Punic wars crisis, provided a plentiful, clean water supply. The building of further aqueducts led to the city&#x27;s expansion and the establishment of public baths (&quot;thermae&quot;) as a central feature of Roman culture. The city also had several theatres, gymnasiums, and many taverns and brothels. Living space was at a premium. Some ordinary citizens and freedmen of middling income might live in modest houses but most of the population lived in apartment blocks (&quot;insulae,&quot; literally &quot;islands&quot;), where the better-off might rent an entire ground floor, and the poorest a single, possibly windowless room at the top, with few or no amenities. Nobles and rich patrons lived in spacious, well-appointed town houses; they were expected to keep &quot;open house&quot; for their peers and clients. A semi-public &quot;atrium&quot; typically functioned as a meeting-space, and a vehicle for display of wealth, artistic taste, and religious piety. Noble &quot;atria&quot; were also display areas for ancestor-masks (&quot;imagines&quot;).

Most Roman towns and cities had a forum and temples, as did the city of Rome itself. Aqueducts brought water to urban centres. Landlords generally resided in cities and left their estates in the care of farm managers.

==Culture==
===Clothing===

The basic Roman garment was the Greek-style tunic, worn knee-length and short-sleeved (or sleeveless) for men and boys, and ankle-length and long-sleeved for women and girls. The toga was distinctively Roman and became a mark of male citizenship, a statement of social degree. Convention also dictated the type, colour and style of (ankle-boots) appropriate to each level of male citizenship.

The whitest, most voluminous togas were worn by the senatorial class. High-ranking magistrates, priests, and citizen&#x27;s children were entitled to a purple-bordered . Triumphal generals wore an all-purple, gold-embroidered , associated with the image of Jupiter and Rome&#x27;s former kingsbut only for a single day; Republican mores simultaneously fostered competitive display and attempted its containment, to preserve at least a notional equality between peers and reduce the potential threats of class envy. Most Roman citizens, particularly the lower class of plebs, opted for more comfortable and practical garments, such as tunics and cloaks.

Luxurious and highly coloured clothing had always been available to those who could afford it, particularly women of the leisured classes. There is material evidence for cloth-of-gold (lamé) as early as the 7th century. By the 3rd century, significant quantities of raw silk were being imported from Han China. Tyrian purple, a quasi-sacred colour, was officially reserved for the border of the and for the solid purple .

For most Romans, even the cheapest linen or woolen clothing represented a major expense. Worn clothing was passed down the social scale until it fell to rags, and these were used for patchwork. Wool and linen were the mainstays of Roman clothing, idealised by moralists as simple and frugal. For most women, the preparation and weaving of wool were part of daily housekeeping, either for family use or for sale. In traditionalist, wealthy households, the family&#x27;s spindles and looms were positioned in the semi-public reception area (), so the and her could demonstrate their industry and frugality: a largely symbolic and moral activity for those of their class, rather than practical necessity.

As the Republic wore on, its trade, territories and wealth increased. Roman conservatives deplored the apparent erosion of traditional, class-based dress distinctions, and an increasing Roman appetite for luxurious fabrics and exotic &quot;foreign&quot; styles among all classes, including their own. Towards the end of the Republic, the ultra-traditionalist Cato the Younger publicly protested the self-indulgence of his peers, and the loss of Republican &quot;manly virtues&quot;, by wearing a &quot;skimpy&quot; dark woolen toga, without tunic or footwear.

===Food and dining===
Modern study of the dietary habits during the Republic are hampered by various factors. Few writings have survived, and because different components of their diet are more or less likely to be preserved, the archaeological record cannot be relied on.
In the early Republic, the main meal (cena) essentially consisted of a kind of porridge, the &quot;puls&quot;. The simplest kind would be made from emmer, water, salt and fat. The wealthy commonly ate their &quot;puls&quot; with eggs, cheese, and honey and it was also occasionally served with meat or fish. Over the course of the Republican period, the &quot;cena&quot; developed into two courses: the main course and a dessert with fruit and seafood (e.g. molluscs, shrimp). By the late Republic, it was usual for the meal to be served in three parts: an appetiser (&quot;gustatio&quot;), main course (&quot;primae mensae&quot;), and dessert (&quot;secundae mensae&quot;).

During the mid-to-later Republic, wine was increasingly treated as a necessity rather than a luxury. In Ancient Rome, wine was normally mixed with water immediately before drinking, since the fermentation was not controlled and the alcohol proof was high. Sour wine mixed with water and herbs (&quot;posca&quot;) was a popular drink for the lower classes and a staple part of the Roman soldier&#x27;s ration. Beer (&quot;cerevisia&quot;) was known but considered vulgar, and was associated with barbarians.

From 123 BC, a ration of unmilled wheat (as much as 33 kg), known as the &quot;frumentatio&quot;, was distributed to as many as 200,000 people every month by the Roman state.

===Education and language===

Rome&#x27;s original native language was early Latin, the language of the Italic Latins. Most surviving Latin literature is written in Classical Latin, a highly stylised and polished literary language which developed from early and vernacular spoken Latin, from the 1st century. Most Latin speakers used Vulgar Latin, which significantly differed from Classical Latin in grammar, vocabulary, and eventually pronunciation.

Following various military conquests in the Greek East, Romans adapted a number of Greek educational precepts to their own fledgling system. Strenuous, disciplined physical training helped prepare boys of citizen class for their eventual citizenship and a military career. Girls generally received instruction from their mothers in the art of spinning, weaving, and sewing. Schooling of a more formal sort began around 200. Education began at the age of around six, and in the next six to seven years, boys and girls were expected to learn reading, writing and counting. By the age of twelve, they would be learning Latin, Greek, grammar and literature, followed by training for public speaking. Effective oratory and good Latin were highly valued among the elite, and were essential to a career in law or politics.

===Arts===
In the 3rd century, Greek art taken as the spoils of war became popular, and many Roman homes were decorated with landscapes by Greek artists.

Over time, Roman architecture was modified as their urban requirements changed, and the civil engineering and building construction technology became developed and refined. Factors such as wealth and high population densities in cities forced the ancient Romans to discover new architectural solutions of their own. The use of vaults and arches, together with a sound knowledge of building materials, enabled them to achieve unprecedented successes in the construction of imposing infrastructure for public use. These were reproduced at a smaller scale in the most important towns and cities in the Roman Republic. The administrative structure and wealth of the Empire made possible very large projects even in locations remote from the main centres.

===Literature===

Early Roman literature was influenced heavily by Greek authors. From the mid-Republic, Roman authors followed Greek models, to produce free-verse and verse-form plays and other in Latin; for example, Livius Andronicus wrote tragedies and comedies. The earliest Latin works to have survived intact are the comedies of Plautus, written during the mid-Republic. Works of well-known, popular playwrights were sometimes commissioned for performance at religious festivals; many of these were satyr plays, based on Greek models and Greek myths. The poet Naevius may be said to have written the first Roman epic poem, although Ennius was the first Roman poet to write an epic in an adapted Latin hexameter. However, only fragments of Ennius&#x27; epic, the &quot;Annales&quot;, have survived, yet both Naevius and Ennius influenced later Latin epic, especially Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Lucretius, in his &quot;On the Nature of Things&quot;, explicated the tenets of Epicurean philosophy.

The politician, poet and philosopher Cicero&#x27;s literary output was remarkably prolific and so influential on contemporary and later literature that the period from 83 BC to 43 BC has been called the &quot;Age of Cicero&quot;. His oratory continues to influence modern speakers, while his philosophical works, particularly Cicero&#x27;s Latin adaptations of Greek Platonic and Epicurean works, influenced many later philosophers. Other prominent writers of this period include the grammarian and historian of religion Varro, the politician, general and military commentator Julius Caesar, the historian Sallust and the love poet Catullus.

===Sports and entertainment===

The Campus Martius was Rome&#x27;s track and field playground, where youth assembled to play and exercise, which included jumping, wrestling, boxing and racing. Equestrian sports, throwing, and swimming were also preferred physical activities. In the countryside, pastimes included fishing and hunting. Board games played in Rome included dice (Tesserae or Tali), Roman chess (Latrunculi), Roman checkers (Calculi), Tic-tac-toe (Terni Lapilli), and Ludus duodecim scriptorum and Tabula, predecessors of backgammon. Other activities included chariot races, and musical and theatrical performances.

<text>Rickenbacker International Corporation is a string instrument manufacturer based in Santa Ana, California. Rickenbacker is the first known maker of electric guitars, with a steel guitar in 1932, and produces a range of electric guitars and basses.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
Adolph Rickenbacher and George Beauchamp founded the company in 1931 as the Ro-Pat-In Corporation (ElectRo-Patent-Instruments) to sell electric Hawaiian guitars. Beauchamp designed his instruments in collaboration with Paul Barth and Harry Watson, who had been active in the National String Instrument Corporation. The Ro-Pat-In brand name would eventually transform into the &#x27;Rickenbacher&#x27; brand, and ultimately the modern &#x27;Rickenbacker’ was adopted. Early examples bear the brand name &#x27;Electro&#x27;.

The early instruments were nicknamed &quot;frying-pans&quot; because of their long necks and small circular bodies. They are the first known solid-bodied electric guitars, though they were a lap-steel type. They had a single pickup with two magnetized steel covers, shaped like horseshoes, that arched over the strings. By the time they ceased producing the &quot;frying pan&quot; model in 1939, they had made several thousand units.

Electro String also sold amplifiers to go with their guitars. A Los Angeles radio manufacturer named Van Nest designed the first Electro String production-model amplifier. Shortly thereafter, design engineer Ralph Robertson further developed the amplifiers, and by the 1940s at least four different Rickenbacker models were available. James B. Lansing of the Lansing Manufacturing Company designed the speaker in the Rickenbacker professional model. During the early 1940s, Rickenbacker amps were sometimes repaired by Leo Fender, whose repair shop evolved into the Fender Electric Instrument Manufacturing Company.

=== Early history ===
George Beauchamp was a vaudeville performer, violinist, and steel guitarist who, like many acoustic guitarists in the pre-electric-guitar 1920s, was looking for some way to make his instrument cut through an orchestra. He first conceived of a guitar fitted with a phonograph-like amplifying horn. He approached inventor and violin-maker John Dopyera, who made a prototype that was, by all accounts, a failure. Their next collaboration involved experiments with mounting three conical aluminum resonators into the body of the guitar beneath the bridge. These efforts produced an instrument that so pleased Beauchamp that he told Dopyera that they should go into business to manufacture them. After further refinements, Dopyera applied for a patent on the so-called tri-cone guitar on April 9, 1927. Thereafter, Dopyera and his brothers made the tri-cone guitars in their Los Angeles shop, under the brand name &quot;National&quot;. On January 26, 1928, the National String Instrument Corporation opened, with a new factory located near a metal-stamping shop owned by Adolph Rickenbacher and staffed by experienced and competent craftsmen. The company made Spanish and Hawaiian style tri-cone guitars as well as four-string tenor guitars, mandolins, and ukuleles.

Adolph Rickenbacher was born in Basel, Switzerland in 1887 and emigrated to the United States to live with relatives after the death of his parents. Sometime after moving to Los Angeles in 1918, he changed his surname to &quot;Rickenbacker&quot;. In 1925, Rickenbacker and two partners formed the Rickenbacker Manufacturing Company and incorporated it in 1927. By the time he met George Beauchamp and began manufacturing metal bodies for the &quot;Nationals&quot; being produced by the National String Instruments Corporation, Rickenbacker was a highly skilled production engineer and machinist. Adolph Rickenbacker became a shareholder in National and, with the assistance of his Rickenbacker Manufacturing Company, National boosted production to fifty guitars a day.

Unfortunately, National&#x27;s line of instruments was not well diversified and, as demand for the expensive and hard-to-manufacture tri-cone guitars began to slip, the company realized that it would need to produce instruments with a lower production cost to remain competitive. Dissatisfaction with what John Dopyera felt was mismanagement led him to resign from National in January 1929. He subsequently formed the Dobro Manufacturing Corporation, later called Dobro Corporation, Ltd, and began to manufacture his own line of resonator-equipped instruments (dobros). Patent infringement disagreements between National and Dobro led to a lawsuit in 1929, with Dobro suing National for $2 million in damages. Problems within National&#x27;s management, as well as pressure from the deepening Great Depression, led to a production slowdown at National. This ultimately resulted in part of the company&#x27;s fractured management structure organizing support for George Beauchamp&#x27;s newest project: development of a fully electric guitar.

By the late twenties, the idea for electrified string instruments had been around for some time, and experimental banjo, violin, and guitar pickups had been developed. George Beauchamp had experimented with electric amplification as early as 1925, but his early efforts, which used microphones, did not produce the effect he desired. Beauchamp also pursued the idea, building a one-string test guitar out of a 2X4 piece of lumber and an electric phonograph pickup. As problems at National became more apparent, Beauchamp&#x27;s home experiments became more rigorous, and he began to attend night classes in electronics and collaborate with fellow National employee Paul Barth. When they finally developed a prototype electric pickup that met their satisfaction, Beauchamp asked former National shop craftsman Harry Watson to make a wooden neck and body to hold the pickup. Somebody nicknamed it the &quot;fry-pan&quot; because of its shape, though Rickenbacker liked to call it the pancake. The final design Beauchamp and Barth developed was an electric pickup consisting of a pair of horseshoe-shaped magnets that enclosed the pickup coil and completely surrounded the strings.

===Fry-pan &amp; Electro-Spanish===

At the end of 1931, Beauchamp, Barth, Rickenbacker and several other individuals banded together and formed the Ro-Pat-In Corporation (elekt&quot;RO&quot;-&quot;PAT&quot;ent-&quot;IN&quot;struments) to manufacture and distribute electrically amplified musical instruments, with an emphasis on their newly developed A-25 Hawaiian Guitar, often referred to as the &quot;fry-pan&quot; lap-steel electric guitar, as well as an Electric Spanish (standard) model and companion amplifiers. In the summer of 1932, Ro-Pat-In began to manufacture cast aluminum production versions of the Fry-Pan as well as a lesser number of standard Spanish Electrics also known as &quot;Electro-Spanish&quot; models, built from wooden bodies similar to those made in Chicago for the National Company. These instruments constitute the origin of the electric guitar by virtue of their string-driven electro-magnetic pick-ups. In 1933 the Ro-Pat-In company&#x27;s name was changed to Electro String Instrument Corporation and its instruments were labeled simply as &quot;Electro&quot;. In 1934 the name of &quot;Rickenbacker&quot; was added in honor of the company&#x27;s principal partner, Adolph Rickenbacker.

During the early production of the A-22 Fry-Pan, Beauchamp and Rickenbacker would experiment with wooden-bodied Spanish guitars and solid body prototypes; ultimately giving birth to the Electro-Spanish Model B and the Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts. Both models had been experimental, produced as early as 1931, and officially released in 1935. The Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts model was subject to a limited production of forty-six. There were several new design elements found on the Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts. The instrument was the first of its kind to be named for an endorser. While most arch-top guitars had 14-fret neck joints, the Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts fingerboard joined the body at the 17th fret allowing much greater access to the higher frets, creating a full 25-1/2&quot; inch scale. This addition made the Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts the first production full-scale (25-1/2&quot;) electrified guitar.

Another new feature on the Electro-Spanish Ken Roberts is the stock Kauffman Vib-rola tailpiece, the world&#x27;s first patented tremolo (). The Ken Roberts is the first instrument of any type to feature a hand-operated vibrato as standard equipment. It also marks Rickenbacker&#x27;s first link to the unit&#x27;s originator, Clayton Doc Kauffman, who would become a design collaborator for the company a couple of years later.

===Model B Electric===

In 1935, the company introduced several new models including the Model &quot;B&quot; Electric Spanish guitar, which is the first known solid-body electric guitar. Because the original aluminum Fry-Pans were susceptible to tuning problems from expansion of the metal under hot performing lights, they made many of the new models from cast Bakelite, an early synthetic plastic used in bowling balls.

Rickenbacker continued to specialize in steel guitars well into the 1950s, but with the advent of rock and roll, F.C. Hall, owner of Radio &amp; Television Equipment Co. (Radio-Tel), purchased the Electro String Company from Adolph Rickenbacker in 1953. Hall overhauled the business and began focusing on standard electric and acoustic guitars rather than the steel guitars the company pioneered. In 1956, Rickenbacker introduced two instruments with the &quot;neck through body&quot; construction that became a standard feature of many of the company&#x27;s products, including the Combo 400 guitar, the model 4000 bass, and, later, the 600 series. Neck Thru consists of a single wooden piece from the neck through the central body section.

In 1958, Hall introduced prototype called &quot;capris&quot; (the same name of Hall family&#x27;s cat from the pronunciation of the French noun for whim).

In 1963, Rickenbacker developed an electric twelve-string guitar with an innovative headstock design that fit all twelve machine heads onto a standard-length headstock by mounting alternate pairs of machine heads at right-angles to each other. After including the twelve-string guitar in the Rickenbacker 300 Series.

=== Guitars and 1960s rock and roll ===

In the 1960s, Rickenbacker benefited tremendously when a couple of Rickenbacker guitar models became permanently intertwined with the sound and look of The Beatles.

In Hamburg, in 1960, Beatles guitarist John Lennon bought a Rickenbacker 325, which he used throughout the early days of The Beatles. He eventually had the guitar&#x27;s natural alder body refinished in black, and made other modifications, including adding a Bigsby vibrato tailpiece and regularly changing the control knobs. Lennon played this guitar for the Beatles&#x27; 1964 debut on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; (as well as for their third Sullivan appearance, pre-taped the same day but broadcast two weeks later). During Lennon&#x27;s post-Beatles years in New York, he had this guitar restored to its original natural wood finish and the cracked gold pickguard replaced with a white one.

Rickenbacker made two new 325s for Lennon and shipped them to him while the Beatles were in Miami Beach, Florida, on the same 1964 visit to the United States: a one-off custom 12-string 325 model and an updated six-string model with modified electronics and vibrato. He used this newer six-string model on the Beatles&#x27; sequentially &quot;second&quot; appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show.

Lennon accidentally dropped the second 325 model during a 1964 Christmas show, breaking the headstock. While it was being repaired, Rickenbacker&#x27;s UK distributor Rose Morris gave Lennon a model 1966 (the export version of a 325, available exclusively in a red finish and with an F-hole). Lennon later gave the 1966 to fellow Beatle Ringo Starr.
Beatles guitarist George Harrison bought a 420 during a brief visit to the United States in 1963. In February 1964, while in New York City, F.C. Hall of Rickenbacker met with the band and their manager, and gave Harrison a model 360/12 (the second electric twelve-string built by Rickenbacker). This instrument became a key part of the Beatles&#x27; sound on their LP &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; and other Beatles songs through late 1964. Harrison played this guitar sporadically throughout the remainder of his life.

On August 21, 1965, during a Beatles concert tour, Randy Resnick of B-Sharp, a Minnesota music store, presented Harrison with a second model 360/12 FG &quot;New Style&quot; 12-string electric guitar, distinguishable from Harrison&#x27;s first 12-string by its rounded cutaways and edges. A television documentary produced by KSTP-TV in Minneapolis documents the event. Harrison used this guitar on the song &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; and during the Beatles&#x27; 1966 tours. This 12-string&#x27;s whereabouts are unknown, as it was stolen at some point after the band ceased touring.

After the Beatles&#x27; 1965 summer tour, Paul McCartney frequently used a left-handed 1964 4001S FG Rickenbacker bass rather than the lightweight Höfner basses he had used previously. The instrument became popular with other bassists influenced by McCartney&#x27;s highly melodic style.

In 1967, McCartney gave his 4001 a psychedelic paint job, as seen in the promo film for &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; and in the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; film. A year or so later, someone sanded off the finish. A second, over-zealous sanding in the early 1970s removed the &quot;points&quot; of the bass&#x27;s cutaways. McCartney used the Rickenbacker bass during his time with Wings and through his &#x27;80s solo career. He continues to record with it to this day.

Partly because of the Beatles&#x27; popularity and their consistent use of the Rickenbacker brand, many sixties guitarists adopted them, including John Fogerty (Creedence Clearwater Revival), Paul Kantner (Jefferson Airplane), and John Entwistle and Pete Townshend of The Who. As both the British Invasion and the 1960s wound down, Rickenbacker guitars fell out of fashion for a time. Rickenbacker basses, however, remained popular through the 1970s and beyond. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Rickenbacker guitars experienced a renaissance as new wave and jangle pop groups turned to them for their distinctive chime. Demand is particularly high among retro groups influenced by the sound and look of the 1960s.

== Hallmarks of Rickenbackers ==
Some Rickenbacker models feature a stereo &quot;Rick-O-Sound&quot; output socket, allowing each pickup to be routed to different amplifiers or effects chains. Another feature is the use of two truss rods to correct twists and curvature in the neck. Rickenbacker guitars typically have a set neck made of multiple pieces of wood laminated together lengthwise, while their basses have a one-piece neck that extends through the entire body. Rickenbacker instruments are known for narrower necks (41.4 mm versus 43 mm at the nut for most competitors) and lacquered rosewood fingerboards, giving them a different feel.

Known for their bright jangle and chime, early Rickenbacker guitars were often favored by folk rock, and British Invasion bands such as the Searchers, The Beatles and The Who. The early models were equipped with low-output toaster pickups. With the late-1960s advent of heavy rock, these were phased out circa 1969–70, and replaced by high-gain pickups with twice the output. Still, the early models were viewed by Pete Townshend as pivotal in his refinement of feedback techniques and the eventual development of the Marshall sound.

Since the 1960s, a diverse cross-section of artists have played Rickenbacker guitars. In 1979, Tom Petty and Mike Campbell of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers used vintage 1960s models to attain that toaster-pickup jangle. The high-gain pickup sound is associated with acts such as The Jam and R.E.M.

== Basses ==
The 4000 series were the first Rickenbacker bass guitars, introduced in 1957. They followed the 4000 with the 4001 (in 1961), 4002 (limited edition bass introduced in 1977), 4008 (an eight-string model introduced in the mid-1970s), 4003 (in 1979, replacing the 4001 entirely in 1986 and still in production in 2024), and most recently the 4004 series. They also made the 4005, a hollow-bodied bass guitar (from 1965 to 1984)—which did not resemble other 4000 series basses, but rather the new style 360-370 guitars. The 4001S (introduced 1964) was basically a 4001 but with no binding and dot fingerboard inlays. It was exported to England as the RM1999. However, Paul McCartney received one of the early 4001S instruments (his unit was left-handed, and later modified to include a zero fret). Along with McCartney, other early adopters of the 4001 were Roger Waters of Pink Floyd, John Entwistle of The Who, Pete Quaife of The Kinks, Chris Squire of Yes (who technically used the RM1999 British import) and Geddy Lee of Rush.

The model 4003S (&quot;standard&quot;) arrived in 1985, was discontinued in 2000, and relaunched in 2015. This was similar to the 4001S with its dot neck markers and no binding. From 1985 to 2002, the 4003 and 4003S had black hardware and black binding options available. Later special editions included the 4003 Blue Boy, 4003 CS (Chris Squire), Blackstar, Shadow Bass, Tuxedo and 4003 Redneck.

Rickenbacker basses have a distinctive tone. The 4001 and 4003 basses have neck-through construction. The 3000 series, made from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, were cheaper instruments with bolt-on 21-fret necks. There was also a glued-in &quot;set neck&quot; 4000 version in 1975-76 (neck set like a Gibson Les Paul), which featured a 20-fret neck, dot inlays, no binding (similar to the 4001S) and only a single bridge-position mono pickup. Fred Turner of Bachman-Turner Overdrive used the 4000 extensively on the &quot;Not Fragile&quot; album, as seen in a promotional clip for &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Seen Nothing Yet.&quot; This bass also appears on the gatefold sleeve of &quot;Four Wheel Drive&quot;.

In the 1970s, the Rickenbacker bass became a staple of progressive rock, as exemplified by British bassists Mike Rutherford (Genesis) and Chris Squire (Yes). Squire was one of the first to run a Rickenbacker in stereo by splitting the signal, sending the signal through both a guitar amp and a bass amp. Combined with his aggressive picking technique on Rotosound roundwound strings, the effect was a growling, grinding, &quot;concrete mixer&quot; tone that continues to be admired and emulated.
In the hard rock vein, Deep Purple&#x27;s Roger Glover was a prominent Rickenbacker aficionado. Geddy Lee of Rush used a Rickenbacker on the band&#x27;s earlier material. Another enthusiast was Metallica bassist Cliff Burton, whose heavily modified 4001, red with white hardware and trim, debuted during the group&#x27;s &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; era. Also noteworthy was Motörhead vocalist/bassist Ian &quot;Lemmy&quot; Kilmister, for whom Rickenbacker produced a 60-bass run of &quot;Lemmy Kilmister&quot; signature basses: the 4004LK, fitted with three pickups, gold hardware, and elaborate wood carving in the shape of oak leaves. In 2019, the company produced a 420-bass run of Al Cisneros signature basses honoring the prominent Sleep and Om bassist, a long-time Rickenbacker proponent. Cisneros&#x27;s 4003AC model features a signature pickguard, green inlays on the fingerboard, and a removable thumb rest.

The sound of Rickenbacker basses featured early on in the UK punk/New wave music explosion of the late 1970s and early 80s and was used by: Glen Matlock (Sex Pistols), Paul Simonon (The Clash), Peter Hook (Joy Division), Bruce Foxton (The Jam), Paul Gray (The Damned, Eddie &amp; the Hot Rods), Tony James (Generation X), Michael Bradley (The Undertones), Youth (Killing Joke) and in the U.S., Mike Mills (R.E.M.) and Kira Roessler (Black Flag).

Brazilian bassist Alex Malheiros from Azymuth used a 4001 bass during the band&#x27;s early years (most notably between 1972 and 1977). His very rich approach to samba, jazz and funk has some echoes of Chris Squire and Paul McCartney these genres can be tackled by the instrument; it is not only a rock bass and, in the right hands, can be good fit for many genres.

== Acoustic guitars ==
Rickenbacker has produced a number of uniquely designed and distinctively trimmed acoustic guitars. Although a small number of Rickenbacker acoustics were sold in the 1950s and were seen in the hands of stars like Ricky Nelson and Sam Cooke, the company concentrated on their electric guitar and western steel guitar business from the early 1960s onward. From about 1959 through 1994, very few Rickenbacker acoustic guitars were made.

In 1995, an effort was made to re-introduce Rickenbacker acoustics, with factory production beginning in their Santa Ana manufacturing facility in 1996. Four models of flat top acoustic Rickenbackers were depicted in factory literature (maple or rosewood back and sides, jumbo or dreadnaught shape). Each of these four models was also available in both six- and twelve-string configurations, yielding a range of eight distinct instruments. (The 760J &quot;Jazzbo&quot;, an archtop model, was only built as a prototype, with three examples known to exist.) It is estimated that fewer than 500 Rickenbacker acoustic guitars were built before the factory shut down the acoustic department in mid-2006.

In late 2006, Rickenbacker gave a license to build Rickenbacker-branded acoustics to Paul Wilczynski, a luthier with a workshop in San Francisco, California. He continued to offer all eight models of the Rickenbacker flat top guitar line, building each instrument to order, until his license expired on February 1, 2013.

== Pickups ==
Rickenbacker manufactures three pickups for their current standard models: high-gain single-coil, Vintage Toaster single coil, and humbucking. All three pickup designs share the same footprint, so they can retrofit into most current or vintage models. The tone varies from one style to the next, partially because of the types of magnets used but also due to the amount of wire wound around the pickup&#x27;s bobbin.

Most contemporary models come with single-coil high-gain pickups as standard equipment. Many post-British-Invasion players such as Peter Buck, Paul Weller, and Johnny Marr have used instruments with these pickups. Rickenbacker&#x27;s HB1 humbucker/dual coil pickup has a similar tone to a Gibson mini-humbucker pickup, and comes standard on the Rickenbacker 650C and 4004 basses. Vintage reissue models, and some signature models, come with Toaster Top pickups, which resemble a classic two-slotted chrome toaster. Despite their slightly lower output, Toasters produce a brighter, cleaner sound, and are generally seen as key to obtaining the true British Invasion guitar tone, as they were original equipment of the era.

In addition to the standard pickups, vintage reissue bass models are equipped with Horseshoe wrap-around style pickups, very similar to the pickups on the earliest Rickenbacker Frying Pan models.

== Trademark enforcement ==
Rickenbacker are known for their efforts to prevent the sale of counterfeits of their instruments.

<text>The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, often shortened to Romeo and Juliet, is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare early in his career about the romance between two Italian youths from feuding families. It was among Shakespeare&#x27;s most popular plays during his lifetime and, along with &quot;Hamlet&quot;, is one of his most frequently performed. Today, the title characters are regarded as archetypal young lovers.

&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; belongs to a tradition of tragic romances stretching back to antiquity. The plot is based on an Italian tale written by Matteo Bandello and translated into verse as &quot;The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet&quot; by Arthur Brooke in 1562 and retold in prose in &quot;Palace of Pleasure&quot; by William Painter in 1567. Shakespeare borrowed heavily from both but expanded the plot by developing a number of supporting characters, in particular Mercutio and Paris. Believed to have been written between 1591 and 1595, the play was first published in a quarto version in 1597. The text of the first quarto version was of poor quality, however, and later editions corrected the text to conform more closely with Shakespeare&#x27;s original.

Shakespeare&#x27;s use of poetic dramatic structure (including effects such as switching between comedy and tragedy to heighten tension, the expansion of minor characters, and numerous sub-plots to embellish the story) has been praised as an early sign of his dramatic skill. The play ascribes different poetic forms to different characters, sometimes changing the form as the character develops. Romeo, for example, grows more adept at the sonnet over the course of the play.

&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; has been adapted numerous times for stage, film, musical, and opera venues. During the English Restoration, it was revived and heavily revised by William Davenant. David Garrick&#x27;s 18th-century version also modified several scenes, removing material then considered indecent, and Georg Benda&#x27;s &quot;Romeo und Julie&quot; omitted much of the action and used a happy ending. Performances in the 19th century, including Charlotte Cushman&#x27;s, restored the original text and focused on greater realism. John Gielgud&#x27;s 1935 version kept very close to Shakespeare&#x27;s text and used Elizabethan costumes and staging to enhance the drama. In the 20th and into the 21st century, the play has been adapted to film in versions as diverse as George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1936), Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1968), Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; (1996), and Carlo Carlei&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (2013).

==Synopsis==

The play, set in Verona, Italy, begins with a street brawl between Montague and Capulet servants who, like the masters they serve, are sworn enemies. Prince Escalus of Verona intervenes and declares that further breach of the peace will be punishable by death. Later, Count Paris talks to Capulet about marrying his daughter Juliet, but Capulet asks Paris to wait another two years and invites him to attend a planned Capulet ball. Lady Capulet and Juliet&#x27;s Nurse try to persuade Juliet to accept Paris&#x27;s courtship.

Meanwhile, Benvolio talks with his cousin Romeo, Montague&#x27;s son, about Romeo&#x27;s recent depression. Benvolio discovers that it stems from unrequited infatuation for a girl named Rosaline, one of Capulet&#x27;s nieces. Persuaded by Benvolio and Mercutio, Romeo attends the ball at the Capulet house in hopes of meeting Rosaline. However, Romeo instead meets and falls in love with Juliet. Juliet&#x27;s cousin, Tybalt, is enraged at Romeo for sneaking into the ball but is stopped from killing Romeo by Juliet&#x27;s father, who does not wish to shed blood in his house. After the ball, in what is now famously known as the &quot;balcony scene,&quot; Romeo sneaks into the Capulet orchard and overhears Juliet at her window vowing her love to him in spite of her family&#x27;s hatred of the Montagues. Romeo makes himself known to her, and they agree to be married. With the help of Friar Laurence, who hopes to reconcile the two families through their children&#x27;s union, they are secretly married the next day.

Tybalt, meanwhile, still incensed that Romeo had sneaked into the Capulet ball, challenges him to a duel. Romeo, now considering Tybalt his kinsman, refuses to fight. Mercutio is offended by Tybalt&#x27;s insolence, as well as Romeo&#x27;s &quot;vile submission&quot;, and accepts the duel on Romeo&#x27;s behalf. Mercutio is fatally wounded when Romeo attempts to break up the fight, and declares a curse upon both households before he dies. (&quot;A plague on both your houses!&quot;) Grief-stricken and racked with guilt, Romeo confronts and slays Tybalt.

Montague argues that Romeo has justly executed Tybalt for the murder of Mercutio. The Prince, now having lost a kinsman in the warring families&#x27; feud, exiles Romeo from Verona, under penalty of death if he ever returns. Romeo secretly spends the night in Juliet&#x27;s chamber, where they consummate their marriage. Capulet, misinterpreting Juliet&#x27;s grief, agrees to marry her to Count Paris and threatens to disown her when she refuses to become Paris&#x27;s &quot;joyful bride&quot;. When she then pleads for the marriage to be delayed, her mother rejects her.

Juliet visits Friar Laurence for help, and he offers her a potion that will put her into a deathlike coma or catalepsy for &quot;two and forty hours&quot;. The Friar promises to send a messenger, Friar John, to inform Romeo of the plan so that he can rejoin her when she awakens. On the night before the wedding, she takes the drug and, when discovered apparently dead, she is laid in the family crypt.

Friar John, however, is unable to deliver the message about Juliet to Romeo because the onset of a plague makes travel impossible. Instead, Romeo learns of Juliet&#x27;s apparent death from his servant, Balthasar. Heartbroken, Romeo buys poison from an apothecary and goes to the Capulet crypt. He encounters Paris who has come to mourn Juliet privately. Believing Romeo to be a vandal, Paris confronts him and, in the ensuing battle, Romeo kills Paris. Still believing Juliet to be dead, he drinks the poison. Juliet then awakens and, discovering that Romeo is dead, stabs herself with his dagger and joins him in death. The feuding families and the Prince meet at the tomb to find all three dead. Friar Laurence recounts the story of the two &quot;star-cross&#x27;d lovers&quot;, fulfilling the curse that Mercutio swore. The families are reconciled by their children&#x27;s deaths and agree to end their violent feud. The play ends with the Prince&#x27;s elegy for the lovers: &quot;For never was a story of more woe / Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.&quot;

==Sources==
&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; borrows from a tradition of tragic love stories dating back to antiquity. One of these is Pyramus and Thisbe, from Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, which contains parallels to Shakespeare&#x27;s story: the lovers&#x27; parents despise each other, and Pyramus falsely believes his lover Thisbe is dead. The &quot;Ephesiaca&quot; of Xenophon of Ephesus, written in the 3rd century, also contains several similarities to the play, including the separation of the lovers, and a potion that induces a deathlike sleep.

One of the earliest references to the names &quot;Montague&quot; and &quot;Capulet&quot; is from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, who mentions the Montecchi (&quot;Montagues&quot;) and the Cappelletti (&quot;Capulets&quot;) in canto six of &quot;Purgatorio&quot;:

However, the reference is part of a polemic against what Dante saw as moral decay of Florence, Lombardy, and the Italian states in general; through his characters, Dante aimed to chastise Albert I of Germany for neglecting what Dante felt were his responsibilities towards Italy (&quot;you who are negligent&quot;) as &quot;King of the Romans&quot;, as well as successive popes for their encroachment from purely spiritual affairs, thus leading to a climate of incessant bickering and warfare between rival political parties in Lombardy. History records the name of the family &quot;Montague&quot; as being lent to such a political party in Verona, but that of the &quot;Capulets&quot; as from a Cremonese family, both of whom play out their conflict in Lombardy as a whole rather than within the confines of Verona. Allied to rival political factions, the parties are grieving (&quot;One lot already grieving&quot;) because their endless warfare has led to the destruction of both parties, rather than a grief from the loss of their ill-fated offspring as the play sets forth, which appears to be a solely poetic creation within this context.
The earliest known version of the &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; tale akin to Shakespeare&#x27;s play is the story of Mariotto and Ganozza by Masuccio Salernitano, in the 33rd novel of his &quot;Il Novellino&quot; published in 1476. Salernitano sets the story in Siena and insists its events took place in his own lifetime. His version of the story includes the secret marriage, the colluding friar, the fray where a prominent citizen is killed, Mariotto&#x27;s exile, Ganozza&#x27;s forced marriage, the potion plot, and the crucial message that goes astray. In this version, Mariotto is caught and beheaded and Ganozza dies of grief.

Luigi da Porto (1485–1529) adapted the story as &quot;Giulietta e Romeo&quot; and included it in his &quot;Historia novellamente ritrovata di due nobili amanti&quot; &quot;(A Newly-Discovered History of two Noble Lovers&quot;), written in 1524 and published posthumously in 1531 in Venice. Da Porto drew on &quot;Pyramus and Thisbe&quot;, Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot;, and Salernitano&#x27;s &quot;Mariotto e Ganozza&quot;, but it is likely that his story is also autobiographical: He was a soldier present at a ball on 26 February 1511, at a residence of the pro-Venice Savorgnan clan in Udine, following a peace ceremony attended by the opposing pro-Imperial Strumieri clan. There, Da Porto fell in love with Lucina, a Savorgnan daughter, but the family feud frustrated their courtship. The next morning, the Savorgnans led an attack on the city, and many members of the Strumieri were murdered. Years later, still half-paralyzed from a battle-wound, Luigi wrote &quot;Giulietta e Romeo&quot; in Montorso Vicentino (from which he could see the &quot;castles&quot; of Verona), dedicating the &quot;novella&quot; to the &quot;bellisima e leggiadra&quot; (the beautiful and graceful) Lucina Savorgnan. Da Porto presented his tale as historically factual and claimed it took place at least a century earlier than Salernitano had it, in the days Verona was ruled by Bartolomeo della Scala (anglicized as Prince Escalus).

Da Porto presented the narrative in close to its modern form, including the names of the lovers, the rival families of Montecchi and Capuleti (Cappelletti) and the location in Verona. He named the friar Laurence (&quot;frate Lorenzo&quot;) and introduced the characters Mercutio (&quot;Marcuccio Guertio&quot;), Tybalt (&quot;Tebaldo Cappelletti&quot;), Count Paris (&quot;conte (Paride) di Lodrone&quot;), the faithful servant, and Giulietta&#x27;s nurse. Da Porto originated the remaining basic elements of the story: the feuding families, Romeo—left by his mistress—meeting Giulietta at a dance at her house, the love scenes (including the balcony scene), the periods of despair, Romeo killing Giulietta&#x27;s cousin (Tebaldo), and the families&#x27; reconciliation after the lovers&#x27; suicides. In da Porto&#x27;s version, Romeo takes poison and Giulietta keeps her breath until she dies.

In 1554, Matteo Bandello published the second volume of his &quot;Novelle&quot;, which included his version of &quot;Giulietta e Romeo&quot;, probably written between 1531 and 1545. Bandello lengthened and weighed down the plot while leaving the storyline basically unchanged (though he did introduce Benvolio). Bandello&#x27;s story was translated into French by Pierre Boaistuau in 1559 in the first volume of his &quot;Histoires Tragiques&quot;. Boaistuau adds much moralising and sentiment, and the characters indulge in rhetorical outbursts.

In his 1562 narrative poem &quot;The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet&quot;, Arthur Brooke translated Boaistuau faithfully but adjusted it to reflect parts of Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;. There was a trend among writers and playwrights to publish works based on Italian &quot;novelle&quot;—Italian tales were very popular among theatre-goers—and Shakespeare may well have been familiar with William Painter&#x27;s 1567 collection of Italian tales titled &quot;Palace of Pleasure&quot;. This collection included a version in prose of the &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; story named &quot;The goodly History of the true and constant love of Romeo and Juliett&quot;. Shakespeare took advantage of this popularity: &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot;, &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot;, and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; are all from Italian &quot;novelle&quot;. &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is a dramatization of Brooke&#x27;s translation, and Shakespeare follows the poem closely but adds detail to several major and minor characters (the Nurse and Mercutio in particular).

Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Hero and Leander&quot; and &quot;Dido, Queen of Carthage&quot;, both similar stories written in Shakespeare&#x27;s day, are thought to be less of a direct influence, although they may have helped create an atmosphere in which tragic love stories could thrive.

==Date and text==

It is unknown when exactly Shakespeare wrote &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Juliet&#x27;s Nurse refers to an earthquake she says occurred 11 years ago. This may refer to the Dover Straits earthquake of 1580, which would date that particular line to 1591. Other earthquakes—both in England and in Verona—have been proposed in support of the different dates. But the play&#x27;s stylistic similarities with &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and other plays conventionally dated around 1594–95, place its composition sometime between 1591 and 1595. One conjecture is that Shakespeare may have begun a draft in 1591, which he completed in 1595.

Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; was published in two quarto editions prior to the publication of the First Folio of 1623. These are referred to as Q1 and Q2. The first printed edition, Q1, appeared in early 1597, printed by John Danter. Because its text contains numerous differences from the later editions, it is labelled a so-called &#x27;bad quarto&#x27;; the 20th-century editor T. J. B. Spencer described it as &quot;a detestable text, probably a reconstruction of the play from the imperfect memories of one or two of the actors&quot;, suggesting that it had been pirated for publication. An alternative explanation for Q1&#x27;s shortcomings is that the play (like many others of the time) may have been heavily edited before performance by the playing company. However, &quot;the theory, formulated by [Alfred] Pollard,&quot; that the &#x27;bad quarto&#x27; was reconstructed from memory by some of the actors is now under attack. Alternative theories are that some or all of &#x27;the bad quartos&#x27; are early versions by Shakespeare or abbreviations made either for Shakespeare&#x27;s company or for other companies.&quot; In any event, its appearance in early 1597 makes 1596 the latest possible date for the play&#x27;s composition.
The superior Q2 called the play &quot;The Most Excellent and Lamentable Tragedie of Romeo and Juliet&quot;. It was printed in 1599 by Thomas Creede and published by Cuthbert Burby. Q2 is about 800 lines longer than Q1. Its title page describes it as &quot;Newly corrected, augmented and amended&quot;. Scholars believe that Q2 was based on Shakespeare&#x27;s pre-performance draft (called his foul papers) since there are textual oddities such as variable tags for characters and &quot;false starts&quot; for speeches that were presumably struck through by the author but erroneously preserved by the typesetter. It is a much more complete and reliable text and was reprinted in 1609 (Q3), 1622 (Q4) and 1637 (Q5). In effect, all later Quartos and Folios of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; are based on Q2, as are all modern editions since editors believe that any deviations from Q2 in the later editions (whether good or bad) are likely to have arisen from editors or compositors, not from Shakespeare.

The First Folio text of 1623 was based primarily on Q3, with clarifications and corrections possibly coming from a theatrical prompt book or Q1. Other Folio editions of the play were printed in 1632 (F2), 1664 (F3), and 1685 (F4). Modern versions—that take into account several of the Folios and Quartos—first appeared with Nicholas Rowe&#x27;s 1709 edition, followed by Alexander Pope&#x27;s 1723 version. Pope began a tradition of editing the play to add information such as stage directions missing in Q2 by locating them in Q1. This tradition continued late into the Romantic period. Fully annotated editions first appeared in the Victorian period and continue to be produced today, printing the text of the play with footnotes describing the sources and culture behind the play.

==Themes and motifs==
Scholars have found it extremely difficult to assign one specific, overarching theme to the play. Proposals for a main theme include a discovery by the characters that human beings are neither wholly good nor wholly evil, but instead are more or less alike, awaking out of a dream and into reality, the danger of hasty action, or the power of tragic fate. None of these have widespread support. However, even if an overall theme cannot be found it is clear that the play is full of several small thematic elements that intertwine in complex ways. Several of those most often debated by scholars are discussed below.

===Love===
&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is sometimes considered to have no unifying theme, save that of young love. Romeo and Juliet have become emblematic of young lovers and doomed love. Since it is such an obvious subject of the play, several scholars have explored the language and historical context behind the romance of the play.

On their first meeting, Romeo and Juliet use a form of communication recommended by many etiquette authors in Shakespeare&#x27;s day: metaphor. By using metaphors of saints and sins, Romeo was able to test Juliet&#x27;s feelings for him in a non-threatening way. This method was recommended by Baldassare Castiglione (whose works had been translated into English by this time). He pointed out that if a man used a metaphor as an invitation, the woman could pretend she did not understand him, and he could retreat without losing honour. Juliet, however, participates in the metaphor and expands on it. The religious metaphors of &quot;shrine&quot;, &quot;pilgrim&quot;, and &quot;saint&quot; were fashionable in the poetry of the time and more likely to be understood as romantic rather than blasphemous, as the concept of sainthood was associated with the Catholicism of an earlier age. Later in the play, Shakespeare removes the more daring allusions to Christ&#x27;s resurrection in the tomb he found in his source work: Brooke&#x27;s &quot;Romeus and Juliet&quot;.

In the later balcony scene, Shakespeare has Romeo overhear Juliet&#x27;s soliloquy, but in Brooke&#x27;s version of the story, her declaration is done alone. By bringing Romeo into the scene to eavesdrop, Shakespeare breaks from the normal sequence of courtship. Usually, a woman was required to be modest and shy to make sure that her suitor was sincere, but breaking this rule serves to speed along the plot. The lovers are able to skip courting and move on to plain talk about their relationship—agreeing to be married after knowing each other for only one night. In the final suicide scene, there is a contradiction in the message—in the Catholic religion, suicides were often thought to be condemned to Hell, whereas people who die to be with their loves under the &quot;Religion of Love&quot; are joined with their loves in Paradise. Romeo and Juliet&#x27;s love seems to be expressing the &quot;Religion of Love&quot; view rather than the Catholic view. Another point is that, although their love is passionate, it is only consummated in marriage, which keeps them from losing the audience&#x27;s sympathy.

The play arguably equates love and sex with death. Throughout the story, both Romeo and Juliet, along with the other characters, fantasise about it as a dark being, often equating it with a lover. Capulet, for example, when he first discovers Juliet&#x27;s (faked) death, describes it as having deflowered his daughter. Juliet later erotically compares Romeo and death. Right before her suicide, she grabs Romeo&#x27;s dagger, saying &quot;O happy dagger! This is thy sheath. There rust, and let me die.&quot;

===Fate and chance===
Scholars are divided on the role of fate in the play. No consensus exists on whether the characters are truly fated to die together or whether the events take place by a series of unlucky chances. Arguments in favour of fate often refer to the description of the lovers as &quot;star-cross&#x27;d&quot;. This phrase seems to hint that the stars have predetermined the lovers&#x27; future. John W. Draper points out the parallels between the Elizabethan belief in the four humours and the main characters of the play (for example, Tybalt as a choleric). Interpreting the text in the light of humours reduces the amount of plot attributed to chance by modern audiences. Still, other scholars see the play as a series of unlucky chances—many to such a degree that they do not see it as a tragedy at all, but an emotional melodrama. Ruth Nevo believes the high degree to which chance is stressed in the narrative makes &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; a &quot;lesser tragedy&quot; of happenstance, not of character. For example, Romeo&#x27;s challenging Tybalt is not impulsive; it is, after Mercutio&#x27;s death, the expected action to take. In this scene, Nevo reads Romeo as being aware of the dangers of flouting social norms, identity, and commitments. He makes the choice to kill, not because of a tragic flaw, but because of circumstance.

===Duality (light and dark)===
Scholars have long noted Shakespeare&#x27;s widespread use of light and dark imagery throughout the play. Caroline Spurgeon considers the theme of light as &quot;symbolic of the natural beauty of young love&quot; and later critics have expanded on this interpretation. For example, both Romeo and Juliet see the other as light in a surrounding darkness. Romeo describes Juliet as being like the sun, brighter than a torch, a jewel sparkling in the night, and a bright angel among dark clouds. Even when she lies apparently dead in the tomb, he says her &quot;beauty makes / This vault a feasting presence full of light.&quot; Juliet describes Romeo as &quot;day in night&quot; and &quot;Whiter than snow upon a raven&#x27;s back.&quot; This contrast of light and dark can be expanded as symbols—contrasting love and hate, youth and age in a metaphoric way. Sometimes these intertwining metaphors create dramatic irony. For example, Romeo and Juliet&#x27;s love is a light in the midst of the darkness of the hate around them, but all of their activity together is done in night and darkness while all of the feuding is done in broad daylight. This paradox of imagery adds atmosphere to the moral dilemma facing the two lovers: loyalty to family or loyalty to love. At the end of the story, when the morning is gloomy and the sun hiding its face for sorrow, light and dark have returned to their proper places, the outward darkness reflecting the true, inner darkness of the family feud out of sorrow for the lovers. All characters now recognise their folly in light of recent events, and things return to the natural order, thanks to the love and death of Romeo and Juliet. The &quot;light&quot; theme in the play is also heavily connected to the theme of time since light was a convenient way for Shakespeare to express the passage of time through descriptions of the sun, moon, and stars.

===Time===
Time plays an important role in the language and plot of the play. Both Romeo and Juliet struggle to maintain an imaginary world void of time in the face of the harsh realities that surround them. For instance, when Romeo swears his love to Juliet by the moon, she protests &quot;O swear not by the moon, th&#x27;inconstant moon, / That monthly changes in her circled orb, / Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.&quot; From the very beginning, the lovers are designated as &quot;star-cross&#x27;d&quot; referring to an astrologic belief associated with time. Stars were thought to control the fates of humanity, and as time passed, stars would move along their course in the sky, also charting the course of human lives below. Romeo speaks of a foreboding he feels in the stars&#x27; movements early in the play, and when he learns of Juliet&#x27;s death, he defies the stars&#x27; course for him.

Another central theme is haste: Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; spans a period of four to six days, in contrast to Brooke&#x27;s poems spanning nine months. Scholars such as G. Thomas Tanselle believe that time was &quot;especially important to Shakespeare&quot; in this play, as he used references to &quot;short-time&quot; for the young lovers as opposed to references to &quot;long-time&quot; for the &quot;older generation&quot; to highlight &quot;a headlong rush towards doom&quot;. Romeo and Juliet fight time to make their love last forever. In the end, the only way they seem to defeat time is through a death that makes them immortal through art.

Time is also connected to the theme of light and dark. In Shakespeare&#x27;s day, plays were most often performed at noon or in the afternoon in broad daylight. This forced the playwright to use words to create the illusion of day and night in his plays. Shakespeare uses references to the night and day, the stars, the moon, and the sun to create this illusion. He also has characters frequently refer to days of the week and specific hours to help the audience understand that time has passed in the story. All in all, no fewer than 103 references to time are found in the play, adding to the illusion of its passage.

==Criticism and interpretation==
===Critical history===

The earliest known critic of the play was diarist Samuel Pepys, who wrote in 1662: &quot;it is a play of itself the worst that I ever heard in my life.&quot; Poet John Dryden wrote 10 years later in praise of the play and its comic character Mercutio: &quot;Shakespear show&#x27;d the best of his skill in his &quot;Mercutio&quot;, and he said himself, that he was forc&#x27;d to kill him in the third Act, to prevent being killed by him.&quot; Criticism of the play in the 18th century was less sparse but no less divided. Publisher Nicholas Rowe was the first critic to ponder the theme of the play, which he saw as the just punishment of the two feuding families. In mid-century, writer Charles Gildon and philosopher Lord Kames argued that the play was a failure in that it did not follow the classical rules of drama: the tragedy must occur because of some character flaw, not an accident of fate. Writer and critic Samuel Johnson, however, considered it one of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;most pleasing&quot; plays.

In the later part of the 18th and through the 19th century, criticism centred on debates over the moral message of the play. Actor and playwright David Garrick&#x27;s 1748 adaptation excluded Rosaline: Romeo abandoning her for Juliet was seen as fickle and reckless. Critics such as Charles Dibdin argued that Rosaline had been included in the play in order to show how reckless the hero was and that this was the reason for his tragic end. Others argued that Friar Laurence might be Shakespeare&#x27;s spokesman in his warnings against undue haste. At the beginning of the 20th century, these moral arguments were disputed by critics such as Richard Green Moulton: he argued that accident, and not some character flaw, led to the lovers&#x27; deaths.

===Dramatic structure===
In &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Shakespeare employs several dramatic techniques that have garnered praise from critics, most notably the abrupt shifts from comedy to tragedy (an example is the punning exchange between Benvolio and Mercutio just before Tybalt arrives). Before Mercutio&#x27;s death in Act III, the play is largely a comedy. After his accidental demise, the play suddenly becomes serious and takes on a tragic tone. When Romeo is banished, rather than executed, and Friar Laurence offers Juliet a plan to reunite her with Romeo, the audience can still hope that all will end well. They are in a &quot;breathless state of suspense&quot; by the opening of the last scene in the tomb: If Romeo is delayed long enough for the Friar to arrive, he and Juliet may yet be saved. These shifts from hope to despair, reprieve, and new hope serve to emphasise the tragedy when the final hope fails and both the lovers die at the end.

Shakespeare also uses sub-plots to offer a clearer view of the actions of the main characters. For example, when the play begins, Romeo is in love with Rosaline, who has refused all of his advances. Romeo&#x27;s infatuation with her stands in obvious contrast to his later love for Juliet. This provides a comparison through which the audience can see the seriousness of Romeo and Juliet&#x27;s love and marriage. Paris&#x27; love for Juliet also sets up a contrast between Juliet&#x27;s feelings for him and her feelings for Romeo. The formal language she uses around Paris, as well as the way she talks about him to her Nurse, show that her feelings clearly lie with Romeo. Beyond this, the sub-plot of the Montague–Capulet feud overarches the whole play, providing an atmosphere of hate that is the main contributor to the play&#x27;s tragic end.

===Language===
Shakespeare uses a variety of poetic forms throughout the play. He begins with a 14-line prologue in the form of a Shakespearean sonnet, spoken by a Chorus. Most of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is, however, written in blank verse, and much of it in strict iambic pentameter, with less rhythmic variation than in most of Shakespeare&#x27;s later plays. In choosing forms, Shakespeare matches the poetry to the character who uses it. Friar Laurence, for example, uses sermon and sententiae forms and the Nurse uses a unique blank verse form that closely matches colloquial speech. Each of these forms is also moulded and matched to the emotion of the scene the character occupies. For example, when Romeo talks about Rosaline earlier in the play, he attempts to use the Petrarchan sonnet form. Petrarchan sonnets were often used by men to exaggerate the beauty of women who were impossible for them to attain, as in Romeo&#x27;s situation with Rosaline. This sonnet form is used by Lady Capulet to describe Count Paris to Juliet as a handsome man. When Romeo and Juliet meet, the poetic form changes from the Petrarchan (which was becoming archaic in Shakespeare&#x27;s day) to a then more contemporary sonnet form, using &quot;pilgrims&quot; and &quot;saints&quot; as metaphors. Finally, when the two meet on the balcony, Romeo attempts to use the sonnet form to pledge his love, but Juliet breaks it by saying &quot;Dost thou love me?&quot; By doing this, she searches for true expression, rather than a poetic exaggeration of their love. Juliet uses monosyllabic words with Romeo but uses formal language with Paris. Other forms in the play include an epithalamium by Juliet, a rhapsody in Mercutio&#x27;s Queen Mab speech, and an elegy by Paris. Shakespeare saves his prose style most often for the common people in the play, though at times he uses it for other characters, such as Mercutio. Humour, also, is important: scholar Molly Mahood identifies at least 175 puns and wordplays in the text. Many of these jokes are sexual in nature, especially those involving Mercutio and the Nurse.

===Psychoanalytic criticism===
Early psychoanalytic critics saw the problem of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in terms of Romeo&#x27;s impulsiveness, deriving from &quot;ill-controlled, partially disguised aggression&quot;, which leads both to Mercutio&#x27;s death and to the double suicide. &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is not considered to be exceedingly psychologically complex, and sympathetic psychoanalytic readings of the play make the tragic male experience equivalent with sicknesses. Norman Holland, writing in 1966, considers Romeo&#x27;s dream as a realistic &quot;wish fulfilling fantasy both in terms of Romeo&#x27;s adult world and his hypothetical childhood at stages oral, phallic and oedipal&quot; – while acknowledging that a dramatic character is not a human being with mental processes separate from those of the author. Critics such as Julia Kristeva focus on the hatred between the families, arguing that this hatred is the cause of Romeo and Juliet&#x27;s passion for each other. That hatred manifests itself directly in the lovers&#x27; language: Juliet, for example, speaks of &quot;my only love sprung from my only hate&quot; and often expresses her passion through an anticipation of Romeo&#x27;s death. This leads on to speculation as to the playwright&#x27;s psychology, in particular to a consideration of Shakespeare&#x27;s grief for the death of his son, Hamnet.

===Feminist criticism===
Feminist literary critics argue that the blame for the family feud lies in Verona&#x27;s patriarchal society. For Coppélia Kahn, for example, the strict, masculine code of violence imposed on Romeo is the main force driving the tragedy to its end. When Tybalt kills Mercutio, Romeo shifts into a violent mode, regretting that Juliet has made him so &quot;effeminate&quot;. In this view, the younger males &quot;become men&quot; by engaging in violence on behalf of their fathers, or in the case of the servants, their masters. The feud is also linked to male virility, as the numerous jokes about maidenheads aptly demonstrate. Juliet also submits to a female code of docility by allowing others, such as the Friar, to solve her problems for her. Other critics, such as Dympna Callaghan, look at the play&#x27;s feminism from a historicist angle, stressing that when the play was written the feudal order was being challenged by increasingly centralised government and the advent of capitalism. At the same time, emerging Puritan ideas about marriage were less concerned with the &quot;evils of female sexuality&quot; than those of earlier eras and more sympathetic towards love-matches: when Juliet dodges her father&#x27;s attempt to force her to marry a man she has no feeling for, she is challenging the patriarchal order in a way that would not have been possible at an earlier time.

===Queer theory===

A number of critics have found the character of Mercutio to have unacknowledged homoerotic desire for Romeo. Jonathan Goldberg examined the sexuality of Mercutio and Romeo utilising queer theory in &quot;Queering the Renaissance&quot; (1994), comparing their friendship with sexual love. Mercutio, in friendly conversation, mentions Romeo&#x27;s phallus, suggesting traces of homoeroticism. An example is his joking wish &quot;To raise a spirit in his mistress&#x27; circle ... letting it there stand / Till she had laid it and conjured it down.&quot; Romeo&#x27;s homoeroticism can also be found in his attitude to Rosaline, a woman who is distant and unavailable and brings no hope of offspring. As Benvolio argues, she is best replaced by someone who will reciprocate. Shakespeare&#x27;s procreation sonnets describe another young man who, like Romeo, is having trouble creating offspring and who may be seen as being a homosexual. Goldberg believes that Shakespeare may have used Rosaline as a way to express homosexual problems of procreation in an acceptable way. In this view, when Juliet says &quot;...that which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet&quot;, she may be raising the question of whether there is any difference between the beauty of a man and the beauty of a woman.

===The balcony scene===
The balcony scene was introduced by Da Porto in 1524. He had Romeo walk frequently by her house, &quot;sometimes climbing to her chamber window&quot;, and wrote, &quot;It happened one night, as love ordained, when the moon shone unusually bright, that whilst Romeo was climbing the balcony, the young lady ... opened the window, and looking out saw him&quot;. After this they have a conversation in which they declare eternal love to each other. A few decades later, Bandello greatly expanded this scene, diverging from the familiar one: Julia has her nurse deliver a letter asking Romeo to come to her window with a rope ladder, and he climbs the balcony with the help of his servant, Julia and the nurse (the servants discreetly withdraw after this).
Nevertheless, in October 2014, Lois Leveen pointed out in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; that the original Shakespeare play did not contain a balcony; it just says that Juliet appears at a window. The word &quot;balcone&quot; is not known to have existed in the English language until two years after Shakespeare&#x27;s death. The balcony was certainly used in Thomas Otway&#x27;s 1679 play, &quot;The History and Fall of Caius Marius&quot;, which had borrowed much of its story from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and placed the two lovers in a balcony reciting a speech similar to that between Romeo and Juliet. Leveen suggested that during the 18th century, David Garrick chose to use a balcony in his adaptation and revival of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; and modern adaptations have continued this tradition.

==Legacy==
===Shakespeare&#x27;s day===

&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; ranks with &quot;Hamlet&quot; as one of Shakespeare&#x27;s most performed plays. Its many adaptations have made it one of his most enduring and famous stories. Even in Shakespeare&#x27;s lifetime, it was extremely popular. Scholar Gary Taylor measures it as the sixth most popular of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, in the period after the death of Christopher Marlowe and Thomas Kyd but before the ascendancy of Ben Jonson during which Shakespeare was London&#x27;s dominant playwright. The date of the first performance is unknown. The First Quarto, printed in 1597, reads &quot;it hath been often (and with great applause) plaid publiquely&quot;, setting the first performance before that date. The Lord Chamberlain&#x27;s Men were certainly the first to perform it. Besides their strong connections with Shakespeare, the Second Quarto names one of its actors, Will Kemp, instead of Peter, in a line in Act V. Richard Burbage was probably the first Romeo, being the company&#x27;s chief tragedian; and Master Robert Goffe (a boy), the first Juliet. The premiere is likely to have been at The Theatre, with other early productions at the Curtain. &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is one of the first Shakespeare plays to have been performed outside England: a shortened and simplified version was performed in Nördlingen in 1604.

===Restoration and 18th-century theatre===
All theatres were closed down by the puritan government on 6 September 1642. Upon the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, two patent companies (the King&#x27;s Company and the Duke&#x27;s Company) were established, and the existing theatrical repertoire was divided between them.
Sir William Davenant of the Duke&#x27;s Company staged a 1662 adaptation in which Henry Harris played Romeo, Thomas Betterton Mercutio, and Betterton&#x27;s wife Mary Saunderson Juliet: she was probably the first woman to play the role professionally. Another version closely followed Davenant&#x27;s adaptation and was also regularly performed by the Duke&#x27;s Company. This was a tragicomedy by James Howard, in which the two lovers survive.

Thomas Otway&#x27;s &quot;The History and Fall of Caius Marius&quot;, one of the more extreme of the Restoration adaptations of Shakespeare, debuted in 1680. The scene is shifted from Renaissance Verona to ancient Rome; Romeo is Marius, Juliet is Lavinia, the feud is between patricians and plebeians; Juliet/Lavinia wakes from her potion before Romeo/Marius dies. Otway&#x27;s version was a hit, and was acted for the next seventy years. His innovation in the closing scene was even more enduring, and was used in adaptations throughout the next 200 years: Theophilus Cibber&#x27;s adaptation of 1744, and David Garrick&#x27;s of 1748 both used variations on it. These versions also eliminated elements deemed inappropriate at the time. For example, Garrick&#x27;s version transferred all language describing Rosaline to Juliet, to heighten the idea of faithfulness and downplay the love-at-first-sight theme. In 1750, a &quot;Battle of the Romeos&quot; began, with Spranger Barry and Susannah Maria Arne (Mrs. Theophilus Cibber) at Covent Garden versus David Garrick and George Anne Bellamy at Drury Lane.

The earliest known production in North America was an amateur one: on 23 March 1730, a physician named Joachimus Bertrand placed an advertisement in the &quot;Gazette&quot; newspaper in New York, promoting a production in which he would play the apothecary. The first professional performances of the play in North America were those of the Hallam Company.

===19th-century theatre===

Garrick&#x27;s altered version of the play was very popular, and ran for nearly a century. Not until 1845 did Shakespeare&#x27;s original return to the stage in the United States with the sisters Susan and Charlotte Cushman as Juliet and Romeo, respectively, and then in 1847 in Britain with Samuel Phelps at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre. Cushman adhered to Shakespeare&#x27;s version, beginning a string of eighty-four performances. Her portrayal of Romeo was considered genius by many. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote: &quot;For a long time Romeo has been a convention. Miss Cushman&#x27;s Romeo is a creative, a living, breathing, animated, ardent human being.&quot; Queen Victoria wrote in her journal that &quot;no-one would ever have imagined she was a woman&quot;. Cushman&#x27;s success broke the Garrick tradition and paved the way for later performances to return to the original storyline.

Professional performances of Shakespeare in the mid-19th century had two particular features: firstly, they were generally star vehicles, with supporting roles cut or marginalised to give greater prominence to the central characters. Secondly, they were &quot;pictorial&quot;, placing the action on spectacular and elaborate sets (requiring lengthy pauses for scene changes) and with the frequent use of tableaux. Henry Irving&#x27;s 1882 production at the Lyceum Theatre (with himself as Romeo and Ellen Terry as Juliet) is considered an archetype of the pictorial style. In 1895, Sir Johnston Forbes-Robertson took over from Irving and laid the groundwork for a more natural portrayal of Shakespeare that remains popular today. Forbes-Robertson avoided the showiness of Irving and instead portrayed a down-to-earth Romeo, expressing the poetic dialogue as realistic prose and avoiding melodramatic flourish.

American actors began to rival their British counterparts. Edwin Booth (brother to John Wilkes Booth) and Mary McVicker (soon to be Edwin&#x27;s wife) opened as Romeo and Juliet at the sumptuous Booth&#x27;s Theatre (with its European-style stage machinery, and an air conditioning system unique in New York) on 3 February 1869. Some reports said it was one of the most elaborate productions of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; ever seen in America; it was certainly the most popular, running for over six weeks and earning over $60,000 (). The programme noted that: &quot;The tragedy will be produced in strict accordance with historical propriety, in every respect, following closely the text of Shakespeare.&quot;

The first professional performance of the play in Japan may have been George Crichton Miln&#x27;s company&#x27;s production, which toured to Yokohama in 1890. Throughout the 19th century, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; had been Shakespeare&#x27;s most popular play, measured by the number of professional performances. In the 20th century it would become the second most popular, behind &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

===20th-century theatre===
In 1933, the play was revived by actress Katharine Cornell and her director husband Guthrie McClintic and was taken on a seven-month nationwide tour throughout the United States. It starred Orson Welles, Brian Aherne and Basil Rathbone. The production was a modest success, and so upon the return to New York, Cornell and McClintic revised it, and for the first time the play was presented with almost all the scenes intact, including the Prologue. The new production opened on Broadway in December 1934. Critics wrote that Cornell was &quot;the greatest Juliet of her time&quot;, &quot;endlessly haunting&quot;, and &quot;the most lovely and enchanting Juliet our present-day theatre has seen&quot;.
John Gielgud&#x27;s New Theatre production in 1935 featured Gielgud and Laurence Olivier as Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six weeks into the run, with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet. Gielgud used a scholarly combination of Q1 and Q2 texts and organised the set and costumes to match as closely as possible the Elizabethan period. His efforts were a huge success at the box office, and set the stage for increased historical realism in later productions. Olivier later compared his performance and Gielgud&#x27;s: &quot;John, all spiritual, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity ... I&#x27;ve always felt that John missed the lower half and that made me go for the other ... But whatever it was, when I was playing Romeo I was carrying a torch, I was trying to sell realism in Shakespeare.&quot;

Peter Brook&#x27;s 1947 version was the beginning of a different style of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; performances. Brook was less concerned with realism, and more concerned with translating the play into a form that could communicate with the modern world. He argued, &quot;A production is only correct at the moment of its correctness, and only good at the moment of its success.&quot; Brook excluded the final reconciliation of the families from his performance text.

Throughout the century, audiences, influenced by the cinema, became less willing to accept actors distinctly older than the teenage characters they were playing. A significant example of more youthful casting was in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s Old Vic production in 1960, with John Stride and Judi Dench, which would serve as the basis for his 1968 film. Zeffirelli borrowed from Brook&#x27;s ideas, altogether removing around a third of the play&#x27;s text to make it more accessible. In an interview with &quot;The Times&quot;, he stated that the play&#x27;s &quot;twin themes of love and the total breakdown of understanding between two generations&quot; had contemporary relevance.

Recent performances often set the play in the contemporary world. For example, in 1986, the Royal Shakespeare Company set the play in modern Verona. Switchblades replaced swords, feasts and balls became drug-laden rock parties, and Romeo killed himself by hypodermic needle.
Neil Bartlett&#x27;s production of Romeo and Juliet themed the play very contemporary with a cinematic look which started its life at the Lyric Hammersmith, London then went to West Yorkshire Playhouse for an exclusive run in 1995. The cast included Emily Woof as Juliet, Stuart Bunce as Romeo, Sebastian Harcombe as Mercutio, Ashley Artus as Tybalt, Souad Faress as Lady Capulet and Silas Carson as Paris. In 1997, the Folger Shakespeare Theatre produced a version set in a typical suburban world. Romeo sneaks into the Capulet barbecue to meet Juliet, and Juliet discovers Tybalt&#x27;s death while in class at school.

The play is sometimes given a historical setting, enabling audiences to reflect on the underlying conflicts. For example, adaptations have been set in the midst of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, in the apartheid era in South Africa, and in the aftermath of the Pueblo Revolt. Similarly, Peter Ustinov&#x27;s 1956 comic adaptation, &quot;Romanoff and Juliet&quot;, is set in a fictional mid-European country in the depths of the Cold War. A mock-Victorian revisionist version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; final scene (with a happy ending, Romeo, Juliet, Mercutio, and Paris restored to life, and Benvolio revealing that he is Paris&#x27;s love, Benvolia, in disguise) forms part of the 1980 stage-play &quot;The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby&quot;. &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s R&amp;J&quot;, by Joe Calarco, spins the classic in a modern tale of gay teenage awakening. A recent comedic musical adaptation was &quot;The Second City&#x27;s Romeo and Juliet Musical: The People vs. Friar Laurence, the Man Who Killed Romeo and Juliet&quot;, set in modern times.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; has often been the choice of Shakespeare plays to open a classical theatre company, beginning with Edwin Booth&#x27;s inaugural production of that play in his theatre in 1869, the newly re-formed company of the Old Vic in 1929 with John Gielgud, Martita Hunt, and Margaret Webster, as well as the Riverside Shakespeare Company in its founding production in New York City in 1977, which used the 1968 film of Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s production as its inspiration.

===21st-century theatre===

In 2009, Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe ran a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; which was directed by Dominic Dromgoole, and starred Adetomiwa Edun as Romeo and Ellie Kendrick as Juliet.

In 2013, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; ran on Broadway at Richard Rodgers Theatre from 19 September to 8 December for 93 regular performances after 27 previews starting on 24 August with Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad in the starring roles.

A production of the play starring Tom Holland and Francesca Amewudah-Rivers ran at Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in London&#x27;s West End from 11 May 2024 for a 12-week limited run. The production was directed by Jamie Lloyd.

A production of the play starring Kit Connor and Rachel Zegler opened on Broadway in Fall 2024. The production featured music by Jack Antonoff, direction by Sam Gold, and movement by Sonya Tayeh.

===Ballet===
The best-known ballet version is Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Originally commissioned by the Kirov Ballet, it was rejected by them when Prokofiev attempted a happy ending and was rejected again for the experimental nature of its music. It has subsequently attained an &quot;immense&quot; reputation, and has been choreographed by John Cranko (1962) and Kenneth MacMillan (1965) among others.

In 1977, Michael Smuin&#x27;s production of one of the play&#x27;s most dramatic and impassioned dance interpretations was debuted in its entirety by San Francisco Ballet. This production was the first full-length ballet to be broadcast by the PBS series &quot;Great Performances: Dance in America&quot;; it aired in 1978.

Dada Masilo, a South African dancer and choreographer, reinterpreted Romeo and Juliet in a new modern light. She introduced changes to the story, notably that of presenting the two families as multiracial.

===Music===
At least 24 operas have been based on &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The earliest, &quot;Romeo und Julie&quot; in 1776, a Singspiel by Georg Benda, omits much of the action of the play and most of its characters and has a happy ending. It is occasionally revived. The best-known is Gounod&#x27;s 1867 &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; (libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré), a critical triumph when first performed and frequently revived today. Bellini&#x27;s &quot;I Capuleti e i Montecchi&quot; is also revived from time to time, but has sometimes been judged unfavourably because of its perceived liberties with Shakespeare; however, Bellini and his librettist, Felice Romani, worked from Italian sources—principally Romani&#x27;s libretto for &quot;Giulietta e Romeo&quot; by Nicola Vaccai—rather than directly adapting Shakespeare&#x27;s play. Among later operas, there is Heinrich Sutermeister&#x27;s 1940 work &quot;Romeo und Julia&quot; and Pascal Dusapin&#x27;s first opera on a libretto by Olivier Cadiot (1988).

&quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot; by Berlioz is a &quot;symphonie dramatique&quot;, a large-scale work in three parts for mixed voices, chorus, and orchestra, which premiered in 1839. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; Fantasy-Overture (1869, revised 1870 and 1880) is a 20-minute symphonic poem, containing the famous melody known as the &quot;love theme&quot;. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s device of repeating the same musical theme at the ball, in the balcony scene, in Juliet&#x27;s bedroom and in the tomb has been used by subsequent directors: for example, Nino Rota&#x27;s love theme is used in a similar way in the 1968 film of the play, as is Des&#x27;ree&#x27;s &quot;Kissing You&quot; in the 1996 film. Other classical composers influenced by the play include Henry Hugh Pearson (&quot;Romeo and Juliet, overture for orchestra&quot;, Op. 86), Svendsen (&quot;Romeo og Julie&quot;, 1876), Delius (&quot;A Village Romeo and Juliet&quot;, 1899–1901), Stenhammar (&quot;Romeo och Julia&quot;, 1922), and Kabalevsky (&quot;Incidental Music to Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Op. 56, 1956).

The play influenced several jazz works, including Peggy Lee&#x27;s &quot;Fever&quot;. Duke Ellington&#x27;s &quot;Such Sweet Thunder&quot; contains a piece entitled &quot;The Star-Crossed Lovers&quot; in which the pair are represented by tenor and alto saxophones: critics noted that Juliet&#x27;s sax dominates the piece, rather than offering an image of equality. The play has frequently influenced popular music, including works by The Supremes, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Waits, Lou Reed, and Taylor Swift. The most famous such track is Dire Straits&#x27; &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

The most famous musical theatre adaptation is &quot;West Side Story&quot; with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. It débuted on Broadway in 1957 and in the West End in 1958 and was twice adapted as popular films in 1961 and in 2021. This version updated the setting to mid-20th-century New York City and the warring families to ethnic gangs. Other musical adaptations include Terrence Mann&#x27;s 1999 rock musical &quot;William Shakespeare&#x27;s Romeo and Juliet&quot;, co-written with Jerome Korman; Gérard Presgurvic&#x27;s 2001 &quot;Roméo et Juliette, de la Haine à l&#x27;Amour&quot;; Riccardo Cocciante&#x27;s 2007 &quot;Giulietta &amp; Romeo&quot; and Johan Christher Schütz; and Johan Petterssons&#x27;s 2013 adaptation &quot;Carnival Tale (Tivolisaga)&quot;, which takes place at a travelling carnival.

===Literature and art===

&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; had a profound influence on subsequent literature. Before then, romance had not even been viewed as a worthy topic for tragedy. In Harold Bloom&#x27;s words, Shakespeare &quot;invented the formula that the sexual becomes the erotic when crossed by the shadow of death&quot;. Of Shakespeare&#x27;s works, &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; has generated the most—and the most varied—adaptations, including prose and verse narratives, drama, opera, orchestral and choral music, ballet, film, television, and painting. The word &quot;Romeo&quot; has even become synonymous with &quot;male lover&quot; in English.

&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; was parodied in Shakespeare&#x27;s own lifetime: Henry Porter&#x27;s &quot;Two Angry Women of Abingdon&quot; (1598) and Thomas Dekker&#x27;s &quot;Blurt, Master Constable&quot; (1607) both contain balcony scenes in which a virginal heroine engages in bawdy wordplay. The play directly influenced later literary works. For example, the preparations for a performance form a major plot in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot;.

&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is one of Shakespeare&#x27;s most-illustrated works. The first known illustration was a woodcut of the tomb scene, thought to be created by Elisha Kirkall, which appeared in Nicholas Rowe&#x27;s 1709 edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. Five paintings of the play were commissioned for the Boydell Shakespeare Gallery in the late 18th century, one representing each of the five acts of the play. Early in the 19th century, Henry Thomson painted &quot;Juliet after the Masquerade&quot;, an of which was published in The Literary Souvenir, 1828, with an accompanying poem by Letitia Elizabeth Landon. The 19th-century fashion for &quot;pictorial&quot; performances led to directors&#x27; drawing on paintings for their inspiration, which, in turn, influenced painters to depict actors and scenes from the theatre. In the 20th century, the play&#x27;s most iconic visual images have derived from its popular film versions.

David Blixt&#x27;s 2007 novel &quot;The Master Of Verona&quot; imagines the origins of the famous Capulet-Montague feud, combining the characters from Shakespeare&#x27;s Italian plays with the historical figures of Dante&#x27;s time. Blixt&#x27;s subsequent novels &quot;Voice Of The Falconer&quot; (2010), &quot;Fortune&#x27;s Fool&quot; (2012), and &quot;The Prince&#x27;s Doom&quot; (2014) continue to explore the world, following the life of Mercutio as he comes of age. More tales from Blixt&#x27;s &quot;Star-Cross&#x27;d&quot; series appear in &quot;Varnished Faces: Star-Cross&#x27;d Short Stories&quot; (2015) and the plague anthology, &quot;We All Fall Down&quot; (2020). Blixt also authored &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Secrets: Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; (2018), a collection of essays on the history of Shakespeare&#x27;s play in performance, in which Blixt asserts the play is structurally not a Tragedy, but a Comedy-Gone-Wrong. In 2014 Blixt and his wife, stage director Janice L Blixt, were guests of the city of Verona, Italy for the launch of the Italian language edition of &quot;The Master Of Verona&quot;, staying with Dante&#x27;s descendants and filmmaker Anna Lerario, with whom Blixt collaborated on a film about the life of Veronese prince Cangrande della Scala.

Lois Leveen&#x27;s 2014 novel &quot;Juliet&#x27;s Nurse&quot; imagined the fourteen years leading up to the events in the play from the point of view of the nurse. The nurse has the third largest number of lines in the original play; only the eponymous characters have more lines.

The play was the subject of a 2017 General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) question by the Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations board that was administered to students. The board attracted widespread media criticism and derision after the question appeared to confuse the Capulets and the Montagues, with exams regulator Ofqual describing the error as unacceptable.

&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; was adapted into manga format by publisher UDON Entertainment&#x27;s Manga Classics imprint and was released in May 2018.

===Screen===
&quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; may be the most-filmed play of all time. The most notable theatrical releases were George Cukor&#x27;s multi-Oscar-nominated 1936 production, Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s 1968 version, and Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s 1996 MTV-inspired &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot;. The latter two were both, in their time, the highest-grossing Shakespeare film ever. &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; was first filmed in the silent era, by Georges Méliès, although his film is now lost. The play was first heard on film in &quot;The Hollywood Revue of 1929&quot;, in which John Gilbert recited the balcony scene opposite Norma Shearer.
Shearer and Leslie Howard, with a combined age over 75, played the teenage lovers in George Cukor&#x27;s MGM 1936 film version. Neither critics nor the public responded enthusiastically. Cinema-goers considered the film too &quot;arty&quot;, staying away as they had from Warner&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; a year before: leading to Hollywood abandoning the Bard for over a decade. Renato Castellani won the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; at the Venice Film Festival for his 1954 film of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. His Romeo, Laurence Harvey, was already an experienced screen actor. By contrast, Susan Shentall, as Juliet, was a secretarial student who was discovered by the director in a London pub and was cast for her &quot;pale sweet skin and honey-blonde hair&quot;.

Stephen Orgel describes Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s 1968 &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; as being &quot;full of beautiful young people, and the camera and the lush technicolour make the most of their sexual energy and good looks&quot;. Zeffirelli&#x27;s teenage leads, Leonard Whiting and Olivia Hussey, had virtually no previous acting experience but performed capably and with great maturity. Zeffirelli has been particularly praised for his presentation of the duel scene as bravado getting out-of-control. The film courted controversy by including a nude wedding-night scene while Olivia Hussey was only fifteen.

Baz Luhrmann&#x27;s 1996 &quot;Romeo + Juliet&quot; and its accompanying soundtrack successfully targeted the &quot;MTV Generation&quot;: a young audience of similar age to the story&#x27;s characters. Far darker than Zeffirelli&#x27;s version, the film is set in the &quot;crass, violent and superficial society&quot; of Verona Beach and Sycamore Grove. Leonardo DiCaprio was Romeo and Claire Danes was Juliet.

The play has been widely adapted for TV and film. In 1960, Peter Ustinov&#x27;s cold-war stage parody, &quot;Romanoff and Juliet&quot; was filmed. The 1961 film &quot;West Side Story&quot;—set among New York gangs—featured the Jets as white youths, equivalent to Shakespeare&#x27;s Montagues, while the Sharks, equivalent to the Capulets, are Puerto Rican. In 2006, Disney&#x27;s &quot;High School Musical&quot; made use of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; plot, placing the two young lovers in different high-school cliques instead of feuding families. Film-makers have frequently featured characters performing scenes from &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The conceit of dramatising Shakespeare writing &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; has been used several times, including John Madden&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;, in which Shakespeare writes the play against the backdrop of his own doomed love affair. An anime series produced by Gonzo and SKY Perfect Well Think, called &quot;Romeo x Juliet&quot;, was made in 2007 and the 2013 version is the latest English-language film based on the play. In 2013, Sanjay Leela Bhansali directed the Bollywood film &quot;Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela&quot;, a contemporary version of the play which starred Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone in leading roles. The film was a commercial and critical success. In February 2014, BroadwayHD released a filmed version of the 2013 Broadway Revival of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The production starred Orlando Bloom and Condola Rashad.

===Modern social media and virtual world productions===
In April and May 2010, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the Mudlark Production Company presented a version of the play, entitled &quot;Such Tweet Sorrow&quot;, as an improvised, real-time series of tweets on Twitter. The production used RSC actors who engaged with the audience as well each other, performing not from a traditional script but a &quot;Grid&quot; developed by the Mudlark production team and writers Tim Wright and Bethan Marlow. The performers also make use of other media sites such as YouTube for pictures and video.

=== Architecture ===
A Juliet balcony (or Juliette balcony) is a balustrade connected to the façade of a building.

=== Astronomy ===
Two of Uranus’s moons, Juliet and Mab, are named for the play.

=== Video Games ===
&quot;The Sims 2&quot; features a neighborhood called Veronaville that features the Capps (Capulet) and the Monty (Montague) families as playable families. The game features the patriarchs of the Capps and Monty families as hating each other, with a love triangle throughout the neighborhood.

<text>Reuben Garrett Lucius Goldberg (July 4, 1883 – December 7, 1970), better known as Rube Goldberg (), was an American cartoonist, sculptor, author, engineer, and inventor.

Goldberg is best known for his popular cartoons depicting complicated gadgets performing simple tasks in indirect, convoluted ways. The cartoons led to the expression &quot;Rube Goldberg machines&quot; to describe similar gadgets and processes. Goldberg received many honors in his lifetime, including a Pulitzer Prize for political cartooning in 1948, the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Gold T-Square Award in 1955, and the Banshees&#x27; Silver Lady Award in 1959. He was a founding member and first president of the National Cartoonists Society, which hosts the annual Reuben Award, honoring the top cartoonist of the year and named after Goldberg, who won the award in 1967. He is the inspiration for international competitions known as Rube Goldberg Machine Contests, which challenge participants to create a complicated machine to perform a simple task.

==Early life and education==
Goldberg was born on July 4, 1883, in San Francisco, California, to Jewish parents Max and Hannah (née Cohn) Goldberg. He was the third of seven children, three of whom died as children; older brother Garrett, younger brother Walter, and younger sister Lillian also survived. Goldberg began tracing illustrations when he was four years old, and he took his only drawing lessons with a local sign painter.
==Personal life==
In 1911, he built the R. L. Goldberg Building at 182–198 Gough Street, San Francisco, for his widowed father to live in, as well as to collect rental income. 

Goldberg married Irma Seeman on October 17, 1916. They lived at 98 Central Park West in New York City and had two sons: Thomas and George. During World War II, as each of his sons headed off to college, Goldberg insisted that they change their surname because of antisemitic sentiment toward him stemming from the political nature of his cartoons. Thomas chose the surname George, and his brother, whose given name was already George, followed suit. In adopting the same surname, George wanted to keep a sense of family cohesiveness.

==Career==

Goldberg&#x27;s father was a San Francisco police and fire commissioner, who encouraged the young Reuben to pursue a career in engineering. Rube graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1904 with a degree in Engineering and was hired by the city of San Francisco as an engineer for the Water and Sewers Department. After six months he resigned his position with the city to join the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; where he became a sports cartoonist. The following year, he took a job with the &quot;San Francisco Bulletin&quot;, where he remained until he moved to New York City in 1907, finding employment as a sports cartoonist with the &quot;New York Evening Mail&quot;.

Goldberg&#x27;s first public hit was a comic strip called &quot;Foolish Questions&quot;, beginning in 1908. The invention cartoons began in 1912. The &quot;New York Evening Mail&quot; was syndicated to the first newspaper syndicate, the McClure Newspaper Syndicate, giving Goldberg&#x27;s cartoons a wider distribution, and by 1915 he was earning $25,000 per year and being billed by the paper as America&#x27;s most popular cartoonist. Arthur Brisbane had offered Goldberg $2,600 per year in 1911 in an unsuccessful attempt to get him to move to William Randolph Hearst&#x27;s newspaper chain, and in 1915 raised the offer to $50,000 per year. Rather than lose Goldberg to Hearst, the &quot;New York Evening Mail&quot; matched the salary offer and formed the Evening Mail Syndicate to syndicate Goldberg&#x27;s cartoons nationally.

In 1916, Goldberg created a series of seven short animated films which focus on humorous aspects of everyday situations in the form of an animated newsreel. The seven films were released on these dates in 1916: May 8, &quot;The Boob Weekly&quot;; May 22, &quot;Leap Year&quot;; June 5, &quot;The Fatal Pie&quot;; Jun 19, &quot;From Kitchen Mechanic to Movie Star&quot;; July 3, &quot;Nutty News&quot;; July 17, &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;; July 31, &quot;Losing Weight&quot;.

Goldberg was syndicated by the McNaught Syndicate from 1922 until 1934.

A prolific artist, it has been estimated that Goldberg created 50,000 cartoons during his lifetime. Some of these cartoons include &quot;Mike and Ike (They Look Alike)&quot;, &quot;Boob McNutt&quot;, &quot;Foolish Questions&quot;, &quot;What Are You Kicking About&quot;, &quot;Telephonies&quot;, &quot;Lala Palooza&quot;, &quot;The Weekly Meeting of the Tuesday Women&#x27;s Club&quot;, and the uncharacteristically serious soap-opera strip, &quot;Doc Wright&quot;, which ran for 10 months beginning January 29, 1933.

The cartoon series that brought him lasting fame was &quot;The Inventions of Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts, A.K.&quot;, which ran in &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot; from January 26, 1929, to December 26, 1931. In that series, Goldberg drew labeled schematics in the form of patent applications of the comically intricate &quot;inventions&quot; that would later bear his name. The character of Professor Butts was based on Rube&#x27;s professor Frederick Slate at the College of Mining and Engineering at the University of California, where Rube attended from 1901 to 1903. Frederick Slate gave his engineering students the task of building a scale that could weigh the Earth. The scale was called the “Barodik&quot;. To Goldberg, this exemplified a comical combination of seriousness and ridiculousness that would come to serve as an inspiration in his work.

From 1938 to 1941, Goldberg drew two weekly strips for the Register and Tribune Syndicate: &quot;Brad and Dad&quot; (1939–1941) and &quot;Side Show&quot; (1938–1941), a continuation of the invention drawings.

Starting in 1938, Goldberg worked as the editorial cartoonist for the &quot;New York Sun&quot;. He won the 1948 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning for a cartoon entitled &quot;Peace Today&quot;. He moved to the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; in 1949 and worked there until his retirement in 1963. In the 1960s, Goldberg began a sculpture career, primarily creating busts.

==Cultural legacy==
The popularity of Goldberg&#x27;s cartoons was such that the term &quot;Goldbergian&quot; was in use in print by 1915, and &quot;Rube Goldberg&quot; by 1928. &quot;Rube Goldberg&quot; appeared in the &quot;Random House Dictionary of the English Language&quot; in 1966 meaning &quot;having a fantastically complicated improvised appearance&quot;, or &quot;deviously complex and impractical.&quot; The 1915 usage of &quot;Goldbergian&quot; was in reference to Goldberg&#x27;s early comic strip &quot;Foolish Questions&quot;, which he drew from 1909 to 1934, while later use of the terms &quot;Goldbergian&quot;, &quot;Rube Goldberg&quot; and &quot;Rube Goldberg machine&quot; refer to the crazy inventions for which he is now best known from his strip &quot;The Inventions of Professor Lucifer Gorgonzola Butts&quot;, drawn from 1914 to 1964.

The corresponding term in the UK was, and still is, &quot;Heath Robinson&quot;, after the English illustrator with an equal devotion to odd machinery, also portraying sequential or chain reaction elements. The Danish equivalent was the painter, author and cartoonist Robert Storm Petersen, better known under his pen name Storm P. To this day, an overly complicated and/or useless object is known as a &quot;Storm P.-machine&quot; in Denmark.

Goldberg&#x27;s work was commemorated posthumously in 1995 with the inclusion of &quot;Rube Goldberg&#x27;s Inventions&quot;, depicting his 1931 &quot;Self-Operating Napkin&quot; in the Comic Strip Classics series of U.S. postage stamps.

The Rube Goldberg Machine Contest originated in 1949 as a competition at Purdue University between two fraternities. It ran until 1956, and was revived in 1983 as a university-wide competition. In 1989 it became a national competition, with a high school division added in 1996. Devices must complete a simple task in a minimum of twenty steps and a maximum of seventy-five in the style of Goldberg. The contest is hosted nationwide by Rube Goldberg Inc., a not-for-profit 501(c)(3), founded by Rube&#x27;s son George W. George, and currently managed by Rube&#x27;s granddaughter, Jennifer George.

In 1998, Justice Scalia remarked in a dissent in a habeas case that &quot;Rube Goldberg would envy the scheme the Court has created.&quot;

===Film and television===
Rube Goldberg wrote the first feature film for the pre-Curly Howard version of The Three Stooges called &quot;Soup to Nuts&quot;, which was released in 1930 and starred Ted Healy. The film featured his machines and included cameos of Rube himself.

In the 1962 John Wayne movie &quot;Hatari!&quot;, an invention to catch monkeys by character Pockets, played by Red Buttons, is described as a &quot;Rube Goldberg.&quot;

In the late 1960s and early &#x27;70s, educational shows like &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Vision On&quot; and &quot;The Electric Company&quot; routinely showed bits that involved Rube Goldberg devices, including the &quot;Rube Goldberg Alphabet Contraption&quot;, and the &quot;What Happens Next Machine&quot;.

Various other films and cartoons have included highly complicated machines that perform simple tasks. Among these are &quot;Flåklypa Grand Prix&quot;, &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot;, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Big Adventure&quot;, &quot;The Way Things Go&quot;, &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, &quot;Honey, I Shrunk the Kids&quot;, &quot;The Goonies&quot;, &quot;Gremlins&quot;, the &quot;Saw&quot; film series, &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot;, &quot;The Cat from Outer Space&quot;, &quot;Malcolm&quot;, &quot;Hotel for Dogs&quot;, the &quot;Home Alone&quot; film series, &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;American Dad!&quot;, &quot;Casper&quot;, and &quot;Waiting...&quot;

In the &quot;Final Destination&quot; film series the characters often die in Rube Goldberg-esque ways. In the film &quot;The Great Mouse Detective&quot;, the villain Ratigan attempts to kill the film&#x27;s heroes, Basil of Baker Street and David Q. Dawson, with a Rube Goldberg style device.
The classic video in this genre was done by the artist duo Peter Fischli &amp; David Weiss in 1987 with their 30-minute video &quot;Der Lauf der Dinge&quot; or &quot;The Way Things Go.&quot;

Honda produced a video in 2003 called &quot;The Cog&quot; using many of the same principles that Fischli and Weiss had done in 1987.

In 2005, the American alternative rock/indie band The Bravery released a video for their debut single, &quot;An Honest Mistake,&quot; which features the band performing the song in the middle of a Rube Goldberg machine.

In 1999, an episode of &quot;The X-Files&quot; was titled &quot;The Goldberg Variation&quot;. The episode intertwined characters FBI agents Mulder and Scully, a simple apartment super, Henry Weems (Willie Garson) and an ailing young boy, Ritchie Lupone (Shia LaBeouf) in a real-life Goldberg device.

The iCarly (2007) episode iDon’t Want to Fight, Spencer built a Rube Goldberg Machine to feed his fish.

The Suite Life on Deck episode A London Carol, Cody built a Rube Goldberg Machine to help Zack wake up at six a.m.

The 2010 music video &quot;This Too Shall Pass – RGM Version&quot; by the rock band OK Go features a machine that, after four minutes of kinetic activity, shoots the band members in the face with paint. &quot;RGM&quot; presumably stands for Rube Goldberg Machine.

2012 The CBS show &quot;Elementary&quot; features a machine in its opening sequence.

The 2012 Discovery Channel show &quot;Unchained Reaction&quot; pitted two teams against each other to create an elaborate Rube Goldberg machine. It was judged and executive-produced by Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, known for hosting the science entertainment series &quot;MythBusters&quot;.

The 2014 web series &quot;Deadbeat&quot; on Hulu features an episode titled &quot;The Ghost in the Machine,&quot; which features the protagonist Kevin helping the ghost of Rube Goldberg complete a contraption. It will bring his grandchildren together after they make a collection of random items into a machine that ends up systematically injuring two of his grandchildren so they end up in the same hospital and finally meet.

===Games===
Both board games and video games have been inspired by Goldberg&#x27;s creations, such as the &#x27;60s board game &quot;Mouse Trap&quot;, the 1990s series of &quot;The Incredible Machine&quot; games, and &quot;Crazy Machines&quot;. The Humongous Entertainment game &quot;Freddi Fish 2: The Case of the Haunted Schoolhouse&quot; involves searching for the missing pieces to a Rube Goldberg machine to complete the game.

In 1909 Goldberg invented the &quot;Foolish Questions&quot; game based on his successful cartoon by the same name. The game was published in many versions from 1909 to 1934.

&quot;Rube Works: The Official Rube Goldberg Invention Game&quot;, the first game authorized by The Heirs of Rube Goldberg, was published by Unity Games (the publishing arm of Unity Technologies) in November 2013.

<text>Robert Stickgold is a professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. A sleep researcher, his work focuses on the relationship between sleep and learning. Stickgold&#x27;s articles in the popular press are intended to illustrate the dangers of sleep deprivation.

Stickgold was born in Chicago. He graduated from Harvard University before attending the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he received his doctorate in biochemistry. He worked with the sleep researcher J. Allan Hobson for many years and has been known to quote Hobson&#x27;s quip: &quot;The only known function of sleep is to cure sleepiness&quot;. Stickgold&#x27;s research has focused on sleep and cognition, dreaming, and conscious states. He has been a proponent of the role of sleep in memory consolidation. Additional research has focused on dreaming. In one experiment, participants played the computer game Tetris for three days and reported dreaming about falling geometric shapes—a phenomenon now known as the Tetris effect. Even patients with anterograde amnesia, who did not remember playing the game, had similar dreams as normal participants. Similar results were found in another study utilizing the video game Alpine Racer 2. Participants reported dreaming about skiing.

Stickgold lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts and has four children.

Stickgold is also a published science fiction author. In 1973, he had his novelette &quot;Susies Reality&quot; published in the May/June issue of &quot;Worlds of IF Science Fiction&quot; anthology magazine. With Mark Noble, he wrote &quot;Gloryhits&quot; in 1978. In 1981, he published &quot;The California Coven Project&quot;.

<text>Religion and mythology differ in scope but have overlapping aspects. Both are systems of concepts that are of high importance to a certain community, making statements concerning the supernatural or sacred. Generally, mythology is considered one component or aspect of religion. Religion is the broader term: besides mythological aspects, it includes aspects of ritual, morality, theology, and mystical experience. A given mythology is almost always associated with a certain religion such as Greek mythology with Ancient Greek religion. Disconnected from its religious system, a myth may lose its immediate relevance to the community and evolve—away from sacred importance—into a legend or folktale.

There is a complex relationship between recital of myths and enactment of rituals.

==Introduction==
The relationship between religion and myth depends on what definition of &quot;myth&quot; one uses. By Robert Graves&#x27;s definition, a religion&#x27;s traditional stories are &quot;myths&quot; if and only if one does not belong to the religion in question. By Segal&#x27;s definition, all religious stories are myths—but simply because nearly all stories are myths. By the folklorists&#x27; definition, all myths are religious (or &quot;sacred&quot;) stories, but not all religious stories are myths: religious stories that involve the creation of the world (e.g., the stories in the Book of Genesis) are myths; however, some religious stories that don&#x27;t explain how things came to be in their present form (e.g., hagiographies of famous saints) are not myths. Generally, mythology is the main component of religion alongside ritual. For example, in the early modern period, distinguished Christian theologians developed elaborated witch mythologies which contributed to the intensification of witch trials. &quot;The Oxford Companion to World Mythology&quot; provides the following summary and examples:Religious stories are &quot;holy scripture&quot; to believers—narratives used to support, explain, or justify a particular system&#x27;s rituals, theology, and ethics—and are myths to people of other cultures or belief systems. […] It is difficult to believe that the Buddha was conceived in a dream by a white elephant, so we call that story a myth as well. But, of course, stories such as the parting of the Sea of Reeds for the fleeing Hebrews, Muhammad&#x27;s Night Journey, and the dead Jesus rising from the tomb are just as clearly irrational narratives to which a Hindu or a Buddhist might understandably apply the word &quot;myth&quot;. All of these stories are definable as myths because they contain events that contradict both our intellectual and physical experience of reality.

Most definitions of &quot;myth&quot; limit myths to stories. Thus, non-narrative elements of religion, such as ritual, are not myths.
===Theology and myth===
The term theology for the first time appears in the writings of the Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle. Initially, theology and mythology were synonymous. With time, both terms gained distinctive qualities:

In the first place, theology is a spiritual or religious attempt of &quot;believers&quot; to explicate their faith. In this sense it is not neutral and is not attempted from the perspective of removed observation—in contrast to a general history of religions. The implication derived from the religious approach is that it does not provide a formal and indifferent scheme devoid of presuppositions within which all religions could be subsumed. In the second place, theology is influenced by its origins in the Greek and Christian traditions, with the implication that the transmutation of this concept to other religions is endangered by the very circumstances of origination.

According to Hege, both primitive and modern theology is inescapably constrained by its mythical backbone:

Hermeneutically, theologians must recognize that mythical thought permeates the biblical texts. Dogmatically, theologians must be aware of the mythological elements of theology and of how extensively theology relies on mythical forms and functions, especially in light of our awareness of the ubiquity of myth.
===Religion===
&quot;Religion&quot; is a belief concerning the supernatural, sacred, or divine, and the moral codes, practices, values, and institutions associated with such belief, although some scholars, such as Durkheim, would argue that the supernatural and the divine are not aspects of all religions. Religious beliefs and practices may include the following: a deity or higher being, eschatology, practices of worship, practices of ethics and politics. Some religions do not include all these features.

===Mythology===
The term &quot;mythology&quot; usually refers either to a system of myths or to the study of myths. However, the word &quot;myth&quot; itself has multiple (and some contradictory) definitions:
* 2007: According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, &quot;Myth: &quot;1 a: a usually traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon. b: Parable, Allegory. 2 a: a popular belief or tradition that has grown up around something or someone; especially: one embodying the ideals and institutions of a society or segment of society. 2b: an unfounded or false notion. 3: a person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence. 4: the whole body of myths.

In regards to the study of culture and religion, these are some of the definitions scholars have used:

* 1968: The classicist Robert Graves defines myths as &quot;whatever religious or heroic legends are so foreign to a student&#x27;s experience that he cannot believe them to be true.&quot;
* 1973: Another classicist, GS Kirk, rejects the notion that all myths are religious or sacred. In the category of &quot;myth&quot;, he includes many legendary accounts that are &quot;secular&quot; for all practical purposes.
* 1997: Folklorists define a myth as &quot;a sacred narrative explaining how the world and humankind came to be in their present form&quot;.
* 2004: In religious studies, the word &quot;myth&quot; is usually reserved for stories whose main characters are gods or demigods.
* 2004: The classicist Richard Buxton defines a myth as &quot;a socially powerful traditional story&quot;.
* 2004: Robert A. Segal, professor of theories of religion at the Lancaster University, defines &quot;myth&quot; broadly as any story whose &quot;main figures [are] personalities -- divine, human, or even animal. Excluded would be impersonal forces such as Plato&#x27;s Good.&quot;

==Similarities between different religious mythologies==

Given any of the above definitions of &quot;myth&quot;, the myths of many religions, both ancient and modern, share common elements. Widespread similarities between religious mythologies include the following:
* an initial Paradise preceding ordinary historical time
* the story of a god who undergoes death and resurrection (life-death-rebirth deity).
* The mythical geography of many religions involves an &quot;axis mundi&quot;, or Cosmic Center.
* Creation myths
* Supreme deity
* Hero&#x27;s journey

The similarities between cultures and time periods can be useful, but it is usually not easy to combine beliefs and histories from different groups. Simplification of cultures and time periods by eliminating detailed data remain vulnerable or flimsy in this area of research.

==Contrasts between different religious mythologies==
Though there are similarities among most religious mythologies, there are also contrasts. Many mythologies focus on explanations of the universe, natural phenomena, or other themes of human existence, often ascribing agency to one or more deities or other supernatural forces. However, some religions have very few of this kind of story of cosmic explanation. For instance, the Buddhist parable of the arrow warns against such speculations as &quot;[Is] the world eternal or not eternal? [Is] the soul different from the body? [Does] the enlightened exist after death or not?&quot;, viewing them as irrelevant to the goal of escaping suffering.

==Academic views==
In academia, the term &quot;myth&quot; often refers to stories whose culture regards them as true (as opposed to fictitious). Thus, many scholars will call a body of stories &quot;mythology&quot;, leaving open the question of whether the stories are true or false. For example, in &quot;Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism&quot;, English professor Howard Schwartz writes, &quot;the definition of &#x27;mythology&#x27; offered here does not attempt to determine if biblical or subsequent narratives are true or false, i.e., historically accurate or not&quot;.

Since the beginning of modern philosophy and science in the 16th century, many Western intellectuals have seen myth as outdated. In fact, some argued that the Christian religion would be better off without mythology, or even that Christianity would be better off without religion:
[J. A. T.] Robinson argued in favor of &quot;the detaching of the Christian doctrine of God from any necessary dependence on a &#x27;supernaturalistic&#x27; worldview&quot;. He understood this as a prophetic aspect of the Church&#x27;s ministry to the world. [...] At this time atheism was regarded as the Christian Gospel that should be preached to the world. J. J. Altizer, for example, maintained [this] boldly by stating, &quot;Throughout its history Christian theology has been thwarted from reaching its intrinsic goal by its bondage to a transcendent, a sovereign, and an impassive God&quot;. [...] [Dietrich] Bonhoffer called persistently for &quot;Religionless Christianity&quot;.
In the 20th century, many scholars have resisted this trend, defending myth from modern criticism. Mircea Eliade, a professor of the history of religions, declared that myth did not hold religion back, that myth was an essential foundation of religion, and that eliminating myth would eliminate a piece of the human psyche. Eliade approached myth sympathetically at a time when religious thinkers were trying to purge religion of its mythological elements:
Eliade wrote about &quot;sky and sky gods&quot; when Christian theology was shaken at its very foundations by the &quot;death of God&quot; theology. He spoke of &quot;God up there&quot; when theologians such as J. A. T. Robinson were busy with erasing the mythical language of [a] three-storied universe that underlies the early Christian thought and experience.
Similarly, Joseph Campbell believed that people could not understand their individual lives without mythology to aid them. By recalling the significance of old myths, he encouraged awareness of them. In responding to the interview question &quot;How would you define mythology?&quot;, Joseph Campbell answered:
My favorite definition of mythology: other people&#x27;s religion. My favorite definition of religion: misunderstanding of mythology.

==Religious views==
Most religions contain a body of traditional sacred stories that are believed to express profound truth. Some religious organizations and practitioners believe that some or all of their traditional stories are not only sacred and &quot;true&quot; but also historically accurate and divinely revealed and that calling such stories &quot;myths&quot; disrespects their special status. Other religious organizations and practitioners have no problem with categorizing their sacred stories as myths.

===Opposition to categorizing all sacred stories as myths===
====Modern-day opposition====
Some religious believers take offense when what they consider to be historical aspects of their faith are labeled as &quot;myth&quot;. Such believers distinguish between religious fables or myths, on one hand, and those sacred narratives which are described by their tradition as being history or revelation, on the other. For instance, Catholic priest Father John A. Hardon insists that &quot;Christianity is not mythology. What we believe in is not religious fantasies, no matter how pious.&quot; Evangelical Christian theologian Carl F. H. Henry insisted that &quot;Judeo-Christian revelation has nothing in common with the category of myth&quot;.

====The roots of the popular meaning of &quot;myth&quot;====
Especially within Christianity, objection to the word &quot;myth&quot; rests on a historical basis. By the time of Christ, the Greco-Roman world had started to use the term &quot;myth&quot; (Greek &quot;muthos&quot;) to mean &quot;fable, fiction, lie&quot;; as a result, the early Christian theologians used &quot;myth&quot; in this sense. Thus, the derogatory meaning of the word &quot;myth&quot; is the traditional Christian meaning, and the expression &quot;Christian mythology&quot;, as used in academic discourse, may offend Christians for this reason.

In addition, this early Christian use of the term &quot;myth&quot; passed into popular usage. Thus, when essential sacred mysteries and teachings are described as &quot;myth&quot;, in modern English, the word often still implies that it is &quot;idle fancy, fiction, or falsehood&quot;. This description could be taken as a direct attack on religious belief, quite contrary to the meaning ostensibly intended by the academic use of the term. Further, in academic writing, though &quot;myth&quot; usually means a fundamental worldview story, even there it is occasionally ambiguous or clearly denotes &quot;falsehood&quot;, as in the &quot;Christ myth theory&quot;. The original term &quot;mythos&quot; (which has no pejorative connotation in English) may be a better word to distinguish the positive definition from the negative.

===Non-opposition to categorizing sacred stories as myths===
Modern day clergy and practitioners within some religious movements have no problem classifying the religion&#x27;s sacred stories as &quot;myths&quot;. They see the sacred texts as indeed containing religious truths, divinely inspired but delivered in the language of mankind. Some examples follow.

====Christianity====
J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s love of myths and devout Catholic faith came together in his assertion that mythology is the divine echo of &quot;the Truth&quot;. Tolkien wrote that myths held &quot;fundamental things&quot;. He expressed these beliefs in his poem &quot;Mythopoeia&quot; circa 1931, which describes myth-making as an act of &quot;sub-creation&quot; within God&#x27;s primary creation. The poem in part says creation is &quot;myth-woven and elf-patterned&quot;:

Tolkien&#x27;s opinion was adopted by another Christian writer, C. S. Lewis, in their conversations: &quot;Tolkien explained to Lewis that the story of Christ was the true myth at the very heart of history and at the very root of reality.&quot; C. S. Lewis freely called the Christ story a &quot;true myth&quot;, and he believed that even pagan myths express spiritual truths. In his opinion, the difference between the Christ story and pagan myths is that the Christ story is historically as well as spiritually true. Lewis writes,
The story of Christ is simply a true myth: a myth working on us in the same way as the others, but with this tremendous difference that it really happened: and one must be content to accept it in the same way, remembering that it is God&#x27;s myth where the others are men&#x27;s myths: i. e. the Pagan stories are God expressing Himself through the minds of poets, using such images as He found there, while Christianity is God expressing Himself through what we call real things.

Another Christian writer, the Catholic priest Father Andrew Greeley, freely applies the term &quot;myth&quot; to Christianity. In his book &quot;Myths of Religion&quot;, he defends this terminology:
Many Christians have objected to my use of this word [myth] even when I define it specifically. They are terrified by a word which may even have a slight suggestion of fantasy. However, my usage is the one that is common among historians of religion, literary critics, and social scientists. It is a valuable and helpful usage; there is no other word which conveys what these scholarly traditions mean when they refer to myth. The Christian would be well advised to get over his fear of the word and appreciate how important a tool it can be for understanding the content of his faith.

At a &quot;Consultation on the Relationship Between the Wesleyan Tradition
and the Natural Sciences&quot; in Kansas City, Missouri, on October 19, 1991, Dennis Bratcher presented a discussion of the adaptation of Near Eastern mythical thought by the Israelites. Bratcher argued that the Old Testament absorbed Near Eastern pagan mythology (although he drew a sharp distinction between the literally-interpreted myths of the Near Eastern pagans and the &quot;mythopoetic&quot; use of imagery from pagan myths by the Hebrews). During this presentation, he gave the following disclaimer:
the term &quot;myth&quot; as used here does not mean &quot;false&quot; or &quot;fiction&quot;. Even in my old and yellowed Webster&#x27;s, &quot;fiction&quot; is the &quot;third&quot; meaning of the word. In its primary and more technical meaning &quot;myth&quot; refers to a story or group of stories that serve to explain how a particular society views their world.

====Judaism====
Some Jewish scholars, including Dov Noy, a professor of folklore at Hebrew University and founder of the Israel Folktale Archives, and Howard Schwartz, Jewish anthologist and English professor at the University of Missouri – St. Louis, have discussed traditional Jewish stories as &quot;mythology&quot;.

Schwartz authored the book &quot;Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism&quot;. It consists of myths and belief statements excerpted from—and, in some cases, synthesized from a number of excerpts from—both Biblical and non-Biblical Jewish texts. According to Schwartz, the Jewish people continue to elaborate on, and compose additions to, their traditional mythology. In the book&#x27;s introduction, Schwartz states that the word &quot;myth&quot;, as used in the book, &quot;is not offered to mean something that is not true, as in the current popular usage&quot;.

====Neopaganism====
Neopagans frequently refer to their sacred stories as &quot;myths&quot;. Asatru, a modern-day revival of Germanic Paganism, holds &quot;that the Eddas, Myths and Norse Sagas are the divinely inspired wisdom of [its] religion&quot;. Wicca, another Neopagan movement, also applies the term &quot;mythology&quot; to its stories.

==Miscellaneous==
The Dewey Decimal system covers &quot;religion&quot; in the 200 range, with books on &quot;&quot;Religious mythology &amp; social theology&quot;, a subset listed under 201.

<text>Red is the color at the long wavelength end of the visible spectrum of light, next to orange and opposite violet. It has a dominant wavelength of approximately 625–750 nanometres. It is a primary color in the RGB color model and a secondary color (made from magenta and yellow) in the CMYK color model, and is the complementary color of cyan. Reds range from the brilliant yellow-tinged scarlet and vermillion to bluish-red crimson, and vary in shade from the pale red pink to the dark red burgundy.

Red pigment made from ochre was one of the first colors used in prehistoric art. The Ancient Egyptians and Mayans colored their faces red in ceremonies; Roman generals had their bodies colored red to celebrate victories. It was also an important color in China, where it was used to color early pottery and later the gates and walls of palaces. In the Renaissance, the brilliant red costumes for the nobility and wealthy were dyed with kermes and cochineal. The 19th century brought the introduction of the first synthetic red dyes, which replaced the traditional dyes. Red became a symbolic color of communism and socialism; Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. The Soviet red banner would subsequently be used throughout the entire history of the Soviet Union. China adopted its own red flag following the Chinese Communist Revolution. A red flag was also adopted by North Vietnam in 1954, and by all of Vietnam in 1975.

Since red is the color of blood, it has historically been associated with sacrifice, danger, and courage. Modern surveys in Europe and the United States show red is also the color most commonly associated with heat, activity, passion, sexuality, anger, love, and joy. In China, India, and many other Asian countries it is the color symbolizing happiness and good fortune.

== Shades and variations ==
Varieties of the color red may differ in hue, chroma (also called saturation, intensity, or colorfulness), or lightness (or value, tone, or brightness), or in two or three of these qualities. Variations in value are also called tints and shades, a tint being a red or other hue mixed with white, a shade being mixed with black. Four examples are shown below.

== In science and nature ==

=== Seeing red ===

The human eye sees red when it looks at light with a wavelength between approximately 625 and 740 nanometers. It is a primary color in the RGB color model and the light just past this range is called infrared, or below red, and cannot be seen by human eyes, although it can be sensed as heat. In the language of optics, red is the color evoked by light that stimulates neither the S or the M (short and medium wavelength) cone cells of the retina, combined with a fading stimulation of the L (long-wavelength) cone cells.

Primates can distinguish the full range of the colors of the spectrum visible to humans, but many kinds of mammals, such as dogs and cattle, have dichromacy, which means they can see blues and yellows, but cannot distinguish red and green (both are seen as gray). Bulls, for instance, cannot see the red color of the cape of a bullfighter, but they are agitated by its movement. (See color vision).

One theory for why primates developed sensitivity to red is that it allowed ripe fruit to be distinguished from unripe fruit and inedible vegetation. This may have driven further adaptations by species taking advantage of this new ability, such as the emergence of red faces.

Red light is used to help adapt night vision in low-light or night time, as the rod cells in the human eye are not sensitive to red.

=== In color theory and on a computer screen ===
In the RYB color model, which is the basis of traditional color theory, red is one of the three primary colors, along with blue and yellow. Painters in the Renaissance mixed red and blue to make violet: Cennino Cennini, in his 15th-century manual on painting, wrote, &quot;If you want to make a lovely violet colour, take fine lac (red lake), ultramarine blue (the same amount of the one as of the other) with a binder&quot;; he noted that it could also be made by mixing blue indigo and red hematite.

In the CMY and CMYK color models, red is a secondary color subtractively mixed from magenta and yellow.

In the RGB color model, red, green and blue are additive primary colors. Red, green and blue light combined makes white light, and these three colors, combined in different mixtures, can produce nearly any other color. This principle is used to generate colors on such as computer monitors and televisions. For example, magenta on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to that used by Cennino Cennini in the Renaissance to make violet, but using additive colors and light instead of pigment: it is created by combining red and blue light at equal intensity on a black screen. Violet is made on a computer screen in a similar way, but with a greater amount of blue light and less red light.

=== Color of sunset ===
As a ray of white sunlight travels through the atmosphere to the eye, some of the colors are scattered out of the beam by air molecules and airborne particles due to Rayleigh scattering, changing the final color of the beam that is seen. Colors with a shorter wavelength, such as blue and green, scatter more strongly, and are removed from the light that finally reaches the eye. At sunrise and sunset, when the path of the sunlight through the atmosphere to the eye is longest, the blue and green components are removed almost completely, leaving the longer wavelength orange and red light. The remaining reddened sunlight can also be scattered by cloud droplets and other relatively large particles, which give the sky above the horizon its red glow.

=== Lasers ===
Lasers emitting in the red region of the spectrum have been available since the invention of the ruby laser in 1960. In 1962 the red helium–neon laser was invented, and these two types of lasers were widely used in many scientific applications including holography, and in education. Red helium–neon lasers were used commercially in LaserDisc players. The use of red laser diodes became widespread with the commercial success of modern DVD players, which use a 660 nm laser diode technology. Today, red and red-orange laser diodes are widely available to the public in the form of extremely inexpensive laser pointers. Portable, high-powered versions are also available for various applications. More recently, 671 nm diode-pumped solid state (DPSS) lasers have been introduced to the market for all-DPSS laser display systems, particle image velocimetry, Raman spectroscopy, and holography.

Red&#x27;s wavelength has been an important factor in laser technologies; red lasers, used in early compact disc technologies, are being replaced by blue lasers, as red&#x27;s longer wavelength causes the laser&#x27;s recordings to take up more space on the disc than would blue-laser recordings.

=== Astronomy ===
* Mars is called the Red Planet because of the reddish color imparted to its surface by the abundant iron oxide present there.
* Astronomical objects that are moving away from the observer exhibit a Doppler red shift.
* Jupiter&#x27;s surface displays a Great Red Spot caused by an oval-shaped mega storm south of the planet&#x27;s equator.
* Red giants are stars that have exhausted the supply of hydrogen in their cores and switched to thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen in a shell that surrounds its core. They have radii tens to hundreds of times larger than that of the Sun. However, their outer envelope is much lower in temperature, giving them an orange hue. Despite the lower energy density of their envelope, red giants are many times more luminous than the Sun due to their large size.
* Red supergiants like Betelgeuse, Antares, Mu Cephei, VV Cephei, and VY Canis Majoris one of the biggest stars in the Universe, are the biggest variety of red giants. They are huge in size, with radii 200 to 1700 times greater than the Sun, but relatively cool in temperature (3000–4500 K), causing their distinct red tint.
* A red dwarf is a small and relatively cool star, which has a mass of less than half that of the Sun and a surface temperature of less than 4,000 K. Red dwarfs are by far the most common type of star in the Galaxy, but due to their low luminosity, from Earth, none are visible to the naked eye.
* Interstellar reddening is caused by the extinction of radiation by dust and gas

=== Pigments and dyes ===

=== Food coloring ===
The most common synthetic food coloring today is Allura Red AC, a red azo dye that goes by several names including: Allura Red, Food Red 17, C.I. 16035, FD&amp;C Red 40, It was originally manufactured from coal tar, but now is mostly made from petroleum.

In Europe, Allura Red AC is not recommended for consumption by children. It is banned in Denmark, Belgium, France and Switzerland, and was also banned in Sweden until the country joined the European Union in 1994. The European Union approves Allura Red AC as a food colorant, but EU countries&#x27; local laws banning food colorants are preserved.

In the United States, Allura Red AC is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in cosmetics, drugs, and food. It is used in some tattoo inks and is used in many products, such as soft drinks, children&#x27;s medications, and cotton candy. On June 30, 2010, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) called for the FDA to ban Red 40. Red 3 dye was banned in the United States in 2025.

Because of public concerns about possible health risks associated with synthetic dyes, many companies have switched to using natural pigments such as carmine, made from crushing the tiny female cochineal insect. This insect, originating in Mexico and Central America, was used to make the brilliant scarlet dyes of the European Renaissance.
=== Autumn leaves ===

The red of autumn leaves is produced by pigments called anthocyanins. They are not present in the leaf throughout the growing season, but are actively produced towards the end of summer. They develop in late summer in the sap of the cells of the leaf, and this development is the result of complex interactions of many influences—both inside and outside the plant. Their formation depends on the breakdown of sugars in the presence of bright light as the level of phosphate in the leaf is reduced.

During the summer growing season, phosphate is at a high level. It has a vital role in the breakdown of the sugars manufactured by chlorophyll. But in the fall, phosphate, along with the other chemicals and nutrients, moves out of the leaf into the stem of the plant. When this happens, the sugar-breakdown process changes, leading to the production of anthocyanin pigments. The brighter the light during this period, the greater the production of anthocyanins and the more brilliant the resulting color display. When the days of autumn are bright and cool, and the nights are chilly but not freezing, the brightest colorations usually develop.

Anthocyanins temporarily color the edges of some of the very young leaves as they unfold from the buds in early spring. They also give the familiar color to such common fruits as cranberries, red apples, blueberries, cherries, raspberries, and plums.

Anthocyanins are present in about 10% of tree species in temperate regions, although in certain areas—a famous example being New England—up to 70% of tree species may produce the pigment. In autumn forests they appear vivid in the maples, oaks, sourwood, sweetgums, dogwoods, tupelos, cherry trees and persimmons. These same pigments often combine with the carotenoids&#x27; colors to create the deeper orange, fiery reds, and bronzes typical of many hardwood species. (See Autumn leaf color).

Oxygenated blood is red due to the presence of oxygenated hemoglobin that contains iron molecules, with the iron components reflecting red light. Red meat gets its color from the iron found in the myoglobin and hemoglobin in the muscles and residual blood.

Plants like apples, strawberries, cherries, tomatoes, peppers, and pomegranates are often colored by forms of carotenoids, red pigments that also assist photosynthesis.

=== Hair color ===
Red hair occurs naturally on approximately 1–2% of the human population. It occurs more frequently (2–6%) in people of northern or western European ancestry, and less frequently in other populations. Red hair appears in people with two copies of a recessive gene on chromosome 16 which causes a mutation in the MC1R protein.

Red hair varies from a deep burgundy through burnt orange to bright copper. It is characterized by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin. The term &quot;redhead&quot; (originally &quot;redd hede&quot;) has been in use since at least 1510.

=== In animal and human behavior ===
Red is associated with dominance in a number of animal species. For example, in mandrills, red coloration of the face is greatest in alpha males, increasingly less prominent in lower ranking subordinates, and directly correlated with levels of testosterone. Red can also affect the perception of dominance by others, leading to significant differences in mortality, reproductive success and parental investment between individuals displaying red and those not. In humans, wearing red has been linked with increased performance in competitions, including professional sport and multiplayer video games. Controlled tests have demonstrated that wearing red does not increase performance or levels of testosterone during exercise, so the effect is likely to be produced by perceived rather than actual performance. Judges of tae kwon do have been shown to favor competitors wearing red protective gear over blue, and, when asked, a significant majority of people say that red abstract shapes are more &quot;dominant&quot;, &quot;aggressive&quot;, and &quot;likely to win a physical competition&quot; than blue shapes. In contrast to its positive effect in physical competition and dominance behavior, exposure to red decreases performance in cognitive tasks and elicits aversion in psychological tests where subjects are placed in an &quot;achievement&quot; context (e.g. taking an IQ test).

== History and art==
=== In prehistory and the ancient world ===
Inside cave 13B at Pinnacle Point, an archeological site found on the coast of South Africa, paleoanthropologists in 2000 found evidence that, between 170,000 and 40,000 years ago, Late Stone Age people were scraping and grinding ochre, a clay colored red by iron oxide, probably with the intention of using it to color their bodies.

Red hematite powder was also found scattered around the remains at a grave site in a Zhoukoudian cave complex near Beijing. The site has evidence of habitation as early as 700,000 years ago. The hematite might have been used to symbolize blood in an offering to the dead.

Red, black and white were the first colors used by artists in the Upper Paleolithic age, probably because natural pigments such as red ochre and iron oxide were readily available where early people lived. Madder, a plant whose root could be made into a red dye, grew widely in Europe, Africa and Asia. The cave of Altamira in Spain has a painting of a bison colored with red ochre that dates to between 15,000 and 16,500 BC.

A red dye called Kermes was made beginning in the Neolithic Period by drying and then crushing the bodies of the females of a tiny scale insect in the genus &quot;Kermes&quot;, primarily &quot;Kermes vermilio&quot;. The insects live on the sap of certain trees, especially Kermes oak trees near the Mediterranean region. Jars of kermes have been found in a Neolithic cave-burial at Adaoutse, Bouches-du-Rhône. Kermes from oak trees was later used by Romans, who imported it from Spain. A different variety of dye was made from &quot;Porphyrophora hamelii&quot; (Armenian cochineal) scale insects that lived on the roots and stems of certain herbs. It was mentioned in texts as early as the 8th century BC, and it was used by the ancient Assyrians and Persians.

In ancient Egypt, red was associated with life, health, and victory. Egyptians would color themselves with red ochre during celebrations. Egyptian women used red ochre as a cosmetic to redden cheeks and lips and also used henna to color their hair and paint their nails.

The ancient Romans wore togas with red stripes on holidays, and the bride at a wedding wore a red shawl, called a &quot;flammeum&quot;. Red was used to color statues and the skin of gladiators. Red was also the color associated with army; Roman soldiers wore red tunics, and officers wore a cloak called a paludamentum which, depending upon the quality of the dye, could be crimson, scarlet or purple. In Roman mythology red is associated with the god of war, Mars. The vexilloid of the Roman Empire had a red background with the letters SPQR in gold. A Roman general receiving a triumph had his entire body painted red in honor of his achievement.

The Romans liked bright colors, and many Roman villas were decorated with vivid red murals. The pigment used for many of the murals was called vermilion, and it came from the mineral cinnabar, a common ore of mercury. It was one of the finest reds of ancient times – the paintings have retained their brightness for more than twenty centuries. The source of cinnabar for the Romans was a group of mines near Almadén, southwest of Madrid, in Spain. Working in the mines was extremely dangerous, since mercury is highly toxic; the miners were slaves or prisoners, and being sent to the cinnabar mines was a virtual death sentence.

=== The Middle Ages ===

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, red was adopted as a color of majesty and authority by the Byzantine Empire, and the princes of Europe. It also played an important part in the rituals of the Roman Catholic Church, symbolizing the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs.

In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation. Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red colored habitus. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany. In medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures; both Christ and the Virgin Mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles.

In western countries red is a symbol of martyrs and sacrifice, particularly because of its association with blood. Beginning in the Middle Ages, the Pope and Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church wore red to symbolize the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs. The banner of the Christian soldiers in the First Crusade was a red cross on a white field, the St. George&#x27;s Cross. According to Christian tradition, Saint George was a Roman soldier who was a member of the guards of the Emperor Diocletian, who refused to renounce his Christian faith and was martyred. The Saint George&#x27;s Cross became the Flag of England in the 16th century, and now is part of the Union Flag of the United Kingdom, as well as the Flag of the Republic of Georgia.

=== Renaissance ===

In Renaissance painting, red was used to draw the attention of the viewer; it was often used as the color of the cloak or costume of Christ, the Virgin Mary, or another central figure.

In Venice, Titian was the master of fine reds, particularly vermilion; he used many layers of pigment mixed with a semi-transparent glaze, which let the light pass through, to create a more luminous color. The figures of God, the Virgin Mary and two apostles are highlighted by their vermilion red costumes.

Queen Elizabeth I of England liked to wear bright reds, before she adopted the more sober image of the &quot;Virgin Queen&quot;. 
Red costumes were not limited to the upper classes. In Renaissance Flanders, people of all social classes wore red at celebrations. One such celebration was captured in &quot;The Wedding Dance&quot; (1566) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder.

The painter Johannes Vermeer skilfully used different shades and tints of vermilion to paint the red skirt in &quot;The Girl with the Wine Glass&quot;, then glazed it with madder lake to make a more luminous color.

=== Reds from the New World ===
In Latin America, the Aztec people, the Paracas culture and other societies used cochineal, a vivid scarlet dye made from insects. From the 16th until the 19th century, cochineal became a highly profitable export from Spanish Mexico to Europe.

=== 18th to 20th century ===

In the 18th century, red began to take on a new identity as the color of resistance and revolution. It was already associated with blood, and with danger; a red flag hoisted before a battle meant that no prisoners would be taken. In 1793–94, red became the color of the French Revolution. A red Phrygian cap, or &quot;liberty cap&quot;, was part of the uniform of the sans-culottes, the most militant faction of the revolutionaries.

In the late 18th century, during a strike English dock workers carried red flags, and it thereafter became closely associated with the new labour movement, and later with the Labour Party in the United Kingdom, founded in 1900.

In Paris in 1832, a red flag was carried by working-class demonstrators in the failed June Rebellion (an event immortalised in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;), and later in the 1848 French Revolution. The red flag was proposed as the new national French flag during the 1848 revolution, but was rejected by at the urging of the poet and statesman Alphonse Lamartine in favour of the tricolor flag. It appeared again as the flag of the short-lived Paris Commune in 1871. It was then adopted by Karl Marx and the new European movements of socialism and communism. Soviet Russia adopted a red flag following the Bolshevik Revolution in 1917. The People&#x27;s Republic of China adopted the red flag following the Chinese Communist Revolution. It was adopted by North Vietnam in 1954, and by all of Vietnam in 1975.

== Symbolism ==

=== Courage and sacrifice ===
Surveys show that red is the color most associated with courage. In western countries red is a symbol of martyrs and sacrifice, particularly because of its association with blood. Beginning in the Middle Ages, the Pope and Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church wore red to symbolize the blood of Christ and the Christian martyrs. The banner of the Christian soldiers in the First Crusade was a red cross on a white field, the St. George&#x27;s Cross. According to Christian tradition, Saint George was a Roman soldier who was a member of the guards of the Emperor Diocletian, who refused to renounce his Christian faith and was martyred. The Saint George&#x27;s Cross became the Flag of England in the 16th century, and now is part of the Union Flag of the United Kingdom, as well as the Flag of the Republic of Georgia.

=== Hatred, anger, aggression, passion, heat and war ===
While red is the color most associated with love, it also the color most frequently associated with hatred, anger, aggression and war. People who are angry are said to &quot;.&quot; Red is the color most commonly associated with passion and heat. In ancient Rome, red was the color of Mars, the god of war—the planet Mars was named for him because of its red color.

=== Warning and danger ===
Red is the traditional color of warning and danger, and is therefore often used on flags. In the Middle Ages up through the French Revolution, a red flag shown in warfare indicated the intent to take no prisoners. Similarly, a red flag hoisted by a pirate ship meant no mercy would be shown to their target. In Britain, in the early days of motoring, motor cars had to follow a man with a red flag who would warn horse-drawn vehicles, before the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 abolished this law. In automobile races, the red flag is raised if there is danger to the drivers. In international football, a player who has made a serious violation of the rules is shown a red penalty card and ejected from the game.

Several studies have indicated that red carries the strongest reaction of all the colors, with the level of reaction decreasing gradually with the colors orange, yellow, and white, respectively. For this reason, red is generally used as the highest level of warning, such as threat level of terrorist attack in the United States. In fact, teachers at a primary school in the UK have been told not to mark children&#x27;s work in red ink because it encourages a &quot;negative approach&quot;.

Red is the international color of stop signs and stop lights on highways and intersections. It was standardized as the international color at the Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals of 1968. It was chosen partly because red is the brightest color in daytime (next to orange), though it is less visible at twilight, when green is the most visible color. Red also stands out more clearly against a cool natural backdrop of blue sky, green trees or gray buildings. But it was mostly chosen as the color for stoplights and stop signs because of its universal association with danger and warning. The 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals of 1968 uses red color also for the margin of danger warning sign, give way signs and prohibitory signs, following the previous German-type signage (established by Verordnung über Warnungstafeln für den Kraftfahrzeugverkehr in 1927).

=== The color that attracts attention ===

Red is the color that most attracts attention. Surveys show it is the color most frequently associated with visibility, proximity, and extroverts. It is also the color most associated with dynamism and activity.

Red is used in modern fashion much as it was used in Medieval painting; to attract the eyes of the viewer to the person who is supposed to be the center of attention. People wearing red seem to be closer than those dressed in other colors, even if they are actually the same distance away. Monarchs, wives of presidential candidates and other celebrities often wear red to be visible from a distance in a crowd. It is also commonly worn by lifeguards and others whose job requires them to be easily found.

Because red attracts attention, it is frequently used in advertising, though studies show that people are less likely to read something printed in red because they know it is advertising, and because it is more difficult visually to read than black and white text.

=== Seduction, sexuality and sin ===
Red by a large margin is the color most commonly associated with seduction, sexuality, eroticism and immorality, possibly because of its close connection with passion and with danger.

Red was long seen as having a dark side, particularly in Christian theology. It was associated with sexual passion, anger, sin, and the devil. In the Old Testament of the Bible, the Book of Isaiah said: &quot;Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow.&quot; In the New Testament, in the Book of Revelation, the Antichrist appears as a red monster, ridden by a woman dressed in scarlet, known as the Whore of Babylon.

Satan is often depicted as colored red and/or wearing a red costume in both iconography and popular culture. By the 20th century, the devil in red had become a folk character in legends and stories. The devil in red appears more often in cartoons and movies than in religious art.

In 17th-century New England, red was associated with adultery. In the 1850 novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne, &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot;, set in a Puritan New England community, a woman is punished for adultery with ostracism, her sin represented by a red letter &#x27;A&#x27; sewn onto her clothes.

Red is still commonly associated with prostitution. At various points in history, prostitutes were required to wear red to announce their profession. Houses of prostitution displayed a red light. Beginning in the early 20th century, houses of prostitution were allowed only in certain specified neighborhoods, which became known as red-light districts. Large red-light districts are found today in Bangkok and Amsterdam.

In the handkerchief code, the color red signifies interest in the sexual act of fisting.

In both Christian and Hebrew tradition, red is also sometimes associated with murder or guilt, with &quot;having blood on one&#x27;s hands&quot;, or &quot;being caught red-handed.

== In religion ==
* In Christianity, red is associated with the blood of Christ and the sacrifice of martyrs. In the Roman Catholic Church it is also associated with pentecost and the Holy Spirit. Since 1295, it is the color worn by Cardinals, the senior clergy of the Roman Catholic Church. Red is the liturgical color for the feasts of martyrs, representing the blood of those who suffered death for their faith. It is sometimes used as the liturgical color for Holy Week, including Palm Sunday and Good Friday, although this is a modern (20th-century) development. In Catholic practice, it is also the liturgical color used to commemorate the Holy Spirit (for this reason it is worn at Pentecost and during Confirmation masses). Because of its association with martyrdom and the Spirit, it is also the color used to commemorate saints who were martyred, such as St. George and all the Apostles (except for the Apostle St. John, who was not martyred, where white is used). As such, it is used to commemorate bishops, who are the successors of the Apostles (for this reason, when funeral masses are held for bishops, cardinals, or popes, red is used instead of the white that would ordinarily be used).
* In Buddhism, red is one of the five colors which are said to have emanated from the Buddha when he attained enlightenment, or nirvana. It is particularly associated with the benefits of the practice of Buddhism; achievement, wisdom, virtue, fortune and dignity. It was also believed to have the power to resist evil. In China red was commonly used for the walls, pillars, and gates of temples.
* In the Shinto religion of Japan, the gateways of temples, called torii, are traditionally painted vermilion red and black. The torii symbolizes the passage from the profane world to a sacred place. The bridges in the gardens of Japanese temples are also painted red (and usually only temple bridges are red, not bridges in ordinary gardens), since they are also passages to sacred places. Red was also considered a color which could expel evil and disease.
* In Taoism, red is sometimes used to symbolize yang.
* In Chinese folk religion, red is also sometimes used to symbolize yang in the context of the creator Pangu, who hatched out of a cosmic egg colored like a &quot;taijitu&quot;. Some art of Pangu colored yang as red. In addition, red is also an auspicious color according to Chinese beliefs.
== Military uses ==
=== Red uniform ===

The red military uniform was adopted by the English Parliament&#x27;s New Model Army in 1645, and was still worn as a dress uniform by the British Army until the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914. Ordinary soldiers wore red coats dyed with madder, while officers wore scarlet coats dyed with the more expensive cochineal. This led to British soldiers being known as red coats.

In the modern British army, scarlet is still worn by the Foot Guards, the Life Guards, and by some regimental bands or drummers for ceremonial purposes. Officers and NCOs of those regiments which previously wore red retain scarlet as the color of their &quot;mess&quot; or formal evening jackets. The Royal Gibraltar Regiment has a scarlet tunic in its winter dress.

Scarlet is worn for some full dress, military band or mess uniforms in the modern armies of a number of the countries that made up the former British Empire. These include the Australian, Jamaican, New Zealand, Fijian, Canadian, Kenyan, Ghanaian, Indian, Singaporean, Sri Lankan and Pakistani armies.

The musicians of the United States Marine Corps Band wear red, following an 18th-century military tradition that the uniforms of band members are the reverse of the uniforms of the other soldiers in their unit. Since the US Marine uniform is blue with red facings, the band wears the reverse.

Red Serge is the uniform of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, created in 1873 as the North-West Mounted Police, and given its present name in 1920. The uniform was adapted from the tunic of the British Army. Cadets at the Royal Military College of Canada also wear red dress uniforms.

The Brazilian Marine Corps wears a red dress uniform.
NATO Military Symbols for Land Based Systems uses red to denote hostile forces, hence the terms &quot;red team&quot; and &quot;Red Cell&quot; to denote challengers during exercises.

== In sports ==

The first known team sport to feature red uniforms was chariot racing during the late Roman Empire. The earliest races were between two chariots, one driver wearing red, the other white. Later, the number of teams was increased to four, including drivers in light green and sky blue. Twenty-five races were run in a day, with a total of one hundred chariots participating.

Today many sports teams throughout the world feature red on their uniforms. Along with blue, red is the most commonly used non-white color in sports. Numerous national sports teams wear red, often through association with their national flags. A few of these teams feature the color as part of their nickname such as Spain (with their association football (soccer) national team nicknamed &quot;La Furia Roja&quot; or &quot;The Red Fury&quot;) and Belgium (whose football team bears the nickname &quot;Rode Duivels&quot; or &quot;Red Devils&quot;).

In club association football (soccer), red is a commonly used color throughout the world. Among European notable club teams most often playing at home in red shirts include Bayern Munich, Benfica, Liverpool, Manchester United and Roma. Furthermore, many prominent teams play in partially red color schemes, involving different-colored sleeves or stripes. A number of teams&#x27; nicknames feature the color. A red penalty card is issued to a player who commits a serious infraction: the player is immediately disqualified from further play and his team must continue with one fewer player for the game&#x27;s duration.

Rosso Corsa is the red international motor racing color of cars entered by teams from Italy. Since the 1920s Italian race cars of Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Lancia, and later Ferrari and Abarth have been painted with a color known as &quot;rosso corsa&quot; (&quot;racing red&quot;). National colors were mostly replaced in Formula One by commercial sponsor liveries in 1968, but unlike most other teams, Ferrari always kept the traditional red, although the shade of the color varies. Ducati traditionally run red factory bikes in motorcycle World Championship racing.

The color is commonly used for professional sports teams in Canada and the United States with eleven Major League Baseball teams, eleven National Hockey League teams, seven National Football League teams and eleven National Basketball Association teams prominently featuring some shade of the color. The color is also featured in the league logos of Major League Baseball, the National Football League and the National Basketball Association. In the National Football League, a red flag is thrown by the head coach to challenge a referee&#x27;s decision during the game. During the 1950s when red was strongly associated with communism in the United States, the modern Cincinnati Reds team was known as the &quot;Redlegs&quot; and the term was used on baseball cards. After the red scare faded, the team was known as the &quot;Reds&quot; again.

In boxing, red is often the color used on a fighter&#x27;s gloves. George Foreman wore the same red trunks he used during his loss to Muhammad Ali when he defeated Michael Moorer 20 years later to regain the title he lost. Boxers named or nicknamed &quot;red&quot; include Red Burman, Ernie &quot;Red&quot; Lopez, and his brother Danny &quot;Little Red&quot; Lopez.

== On flags ==

Red is the most common color found in national flags, found on the flags of 77 percent of the 210 countries listed as independent in 2016; far ahead of white (58 percent); green (40 percent) and blue (37 percent). The British flag bears the colors red, white and blue; it includes the cross of Saint George, patron saint of England, and the saltire of Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, both of which are red on white. The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain, the colors of the French include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries&#x27; flags, such as those of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country. Many former colonies of Spain, such as Mexico, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico and Venezuela, also feature red-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners. Red flags are also used to symbolize storms, bad water conditions, and many other dangers.

The red on the flag of Nepal represents the floral emblem of the country, the rhododendron.

Red, blue, and white are also the Pan-Slavic colors adopted by the Slavic solidarity movement of the late nineteenth century. Initially these were the colors of the Russian flag; as the Slavic movement grew, they were adopted by other Slavic peoples including Slovaks, Slovenes, and Serbs. The flags of the Czech Republic and Poland use red for historic heraldic reasons (see Coat of arms of Poland and Coat of arms of the Czech Republic) &amp; not due to Pan-Slavic connotations. In 2004 Georgia adopted a new white flag, which consists of four small and one big red cross in the middle touching all four sides.

Red, white, and black were the colors of the German Empire from 1870 to 1918, and as such they came to be associated with German nationalism. In the 1920s they were adopted as the colors of the Nazi flag. In &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, Hitler explained that they were &quot;revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past.&quot; The red part of the flag was also chosen to attract attention – Hitler wrote: &quot;the new flag ... should prove effective as a large poster&quot; because &quot;in hundreds of thousands of cases a really striking emblem may be the first cause of awakening interest in a movement.&quot; The red also symbolized the social program of the Nazis, aimed at German workers. Several designs by a number of different authors were considered, but the one adopted in the end was Hitler&#x27;s personal design.

Red, white, green and black are the colors of Pan-Arabism and are used by many Arab countries.

Red, gold, green, and black are the colors of Pan-Africanism. Several African countries thus use the color on their flags, including South Africa, Ghana, Senegal, Mali, Ethiopia, Togo, Guinea, Benin, and Zimbabwe. The Pan-African colors are borrowed from the flag of Ethiopia, one of the oldest independent African countries. Rwanda, notably, removed red from its flag after the Rwandan genocide because of red&#x27;s association with blood.

The flags of Japan and Bangladesh both have a red circle in the middle of different colored backgrounds. The flag of the Philippines has a red trapezoid on the bottom signifying blood, courage, and valor (also, if the flag is inverted so that the red trapezoid is on top and the blue at the bottom, it indicates a state of war). The flag of Singapore has a red rectangle on the top. The field of the flag of Portugal is green and red. The Ottoman Empire adopted several different red flags during the six centuries of its rule, with the successor Republic of Turkey continuing the 1844 Ottoman flag.
== In politics ==
 
In 18th-century Europe, red was usually associated with the monarchy and with those in power. The Pope wore red, as did the Swiss Guards of the Kings of France, the soldiers of the British Army and the Danish Army.

In the Roman Empire, freed slaves were given a red Phrygian cap as an emblem of their liberation. Because of this symbolism, the red &quot;Liberty cap&quot; became a symbol of the American patriots fighting for independence from England. During the French Revolution, the Jacobins also adapted the red Phrygian cap, and forced the deposed King Louis XVI to wear one after his arrest.

===Socialism and communism===
In the 19th century, with the Industrial Revolution and the rise of worker&#x27;s movements, red became the color of socialism (especially the Marxist variant), and, with the Paris Commune of 1871, of revolution.

In the 20th century, red was the color first of the Russian Bolsheviks and then, after the success of the Russian Revolution of 1917, of communist parties around the world. However, after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia went back to the pre-revolutionary blue, white and red flag.

Red also became the color of many social democratic parties in Europe, including the Labour Party in Britain (founded 1900); the Social Democratic Party of Germany (whose roots went back to 1863) and the French Socialist Party, which dated back under different names, to 1879. The Socialist Party of America (1901–1972) and the Communist Party USA (1919) both also chose red as their color.

Members of the Christian-Social People&#x27;s Party in Liechtenstein (founded 1918) advocated an expansion of democracy and progressive social policies, and were often referred to disparagingly as &quot;Reds&quot; for their social liberal leanings and party colors.

The Chinese Communist Party, founded in 1920, adopted the red flag and hammer and sickle emblem of the Soviet Union, which became the national symbols when the Party took power in China in 1949. Under Party leader Mao Zedong, the Party anthem became &quot;The East Is Red&quot;, and Mao Zedong himself was sometimes referred to as a &quot;red sun&quot;. During the Cultural Revolution in China, Party ideology was enforced by the Red Guards, and the sayings of Mao Zedong were published as a little red book in hundreds of millions of copies. Today the Chinese Communist Party claims to be the largest political party in the world, with eighty million members.

Beginning in the 1960s and the 1970s, paramilitary extremist groups such as the Red Army Faction in Germany, the Japanese Red Army and the Shining Path Maoist movement in Peru used red as their color. But in the 1980s, some European socialist and social democratic parties, such as the Labour Party in Britain and the Socialist Party in France, moved away from the symbolism of the far left, keeping the red color but changing their symbol to a less-threatening red rose.

Red is used around the world by political parties of the left or center-left. In the United States, it is the color of the Communist Party USA, and of the Social Democrats, USA.

===United States===
In the United States, political commentators often refer to the &quot;red states&quot;, which voted for Republican candidates in the last four presidential elections, and &quot;blue states&quot;, which voted for Democrats. This convention is relatively recent: before the 2000 presidential election, media outlets assigned red and blue to both parties, sometimes alternating the allocation for each election. Fixed usage was established during the 39-day recount following the 2000 election, when the media began to discuss the contest in terms of &quot;red states&quot; versus &quot;blue states&quot;. States which voted for different parties in two of the last four presidential elections are called &quot;Swing States&quot;, and are usually colored purple, a mix of red and blue.

== Social and special interest groups ==
Such names as Red Club (a bar), Red Carpet (a discothèque) or Red Cottbus and Club Red (event locations) suggest liveliness and excitement. The Red Hat Society is a social group founded in 1998 for women 50 and over. Use of the color red to call attention to an emergency situation is evident in the names of such organizations as the Red Cross (humanitarian aid), Red Hot Organization (AIDS support), and the Red List of Threatened Species (of IUCN). In reference to humans, term &quot;red&quot; is often used in the West to describe the indigenous peoples of the Americas.

== Idioms ==
Many idiomatic expressions exploit the various connotations of red:
Expressing emotion
* &quot;to see red&quot; (to be angry or aggressive)
* &quot;to have red ears / a red face&quot; (to be embarrassed)
* &quot;to paint the town red&quot; (to have an enjoyable evening, usually with a generous amount of eating, drinking, dancing)
Giving warning
* &quot;to raise a red flag&quot; (to signal that something is problematic)
* &quot;like a red rag to a bull&quot; (to cause someone to be enraged)
* &quot;to be in the red&quot; (to be losing money, from the accounting convention of writing deficits and losses in red ink)
Calling attention
* &quot;a red letter day&quot; (a special or important event, from the medieval custom of printing the dates of saints&#x27; days and holy days in red ink.)

* &quot;to give red-carpet treatment&quot; (to treat someone as important or special)
* &quot;to catch someone red-handed&quot; (to catch or discover someone doing something bad or wrong)

Other idioms
* &quot;to tie up in red tape&quot;. In England red tape was used by lawyers and government officials to identify important documents. It became a term for excessive bureaucratic regulation. It was popularized in the 19th century by the writer Thomas Carlyle, who complained about &quot;red-tapism&quot;.
* &quot;red herring&quot;. A false clue that leads investigators off the track. Refers to the practice of using a fragrant smoked fish to distract hunting or tracking dogs from the track they are meant to follow.
* &quot;red ink&quot; (to show a business loss)

<doc id="25829" wikidata="Q170148" url="?curid=25829" title="Ragnarök">
<text>In Norse mythology,  (also Ragnarok; or ; ) is a foretold series of impending events, including a great battle in which numerous great Norse mythological figures will perish (including the gods Odin, Thor, Týr, Freyr, Heimdall, and Loki); it will entail a catastrophic series of natural disasters, including the burning of the world, and culminate in the submersion of the world underwater. After these events, the world will rise again, cleansed and fertile, the surviving and returning gods will meet, and the world will be repopulated by two human survivors, Líf and Lífþrasir. is an important event in Norse mythology and has been the subject of scholarly discourse and theory in the history of Germanic studies.

The event is attested primarily in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled in the 13th century from earlier traditional sources, and the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written in the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; and in a single poem in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, the event is referred to as , a usage popularised by 19th-century composer Richard Wagner with the title of the last of his &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; operas, (1876), which is &quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot; in German.

==Etymology==
The Old Norse compound word has a long history of interpretation. Its first element is clear: , the genitive plural of (n. pl.) &#x27;the ruling powers, gods.&#x27; The second element is more problematic, as it occurs in two variants, and . Writing in the early 20th century, philologist Geir Zoëga treats the two forms as two separate compounds, glossing as &#x27;the doom or destruction of the gods&#x27; and as &#x27;the twilight of the gods.&#x27; The plural noun has several meanings, including &#x27;development&#x27;, &#x27;origin&#x27;, &#x27;cause&#x27;, &#x27;relation&#x27;, &#x27;fate.&#x27; The word as a whole is then usually interpreted as the &#x27;final destiny of the gods.&#x27;

The singular form is found in a stanza of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem &quot;Lokasenna&quot;, and in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;. The noun means &#x27;twilight&#x27; (from the verb &#x27;to grow dark&#x27;), suggesting a translation &#x27;twilight of the gods.&#x27; This reading was widely considered a result of folk etymology, or a learned reinterpretation of the original term due to the merger of (spelled ǫ) and (spelled ø) in Old Icelandic after 
(nevertheless giving rise to the calque &#x27;Twilight of the Gods&#x27; in the German reception of Norse mythology).

Other terms used to refer to the events surrounding in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; include ( means age, &#x27;end of an age&#x27;) from a stanza of , from two stanzas of , (&#x27;when the gods die&#x27;) from , (&#x27;when the gods will be destroyed&#x27;) from , , and , (&#x27;destruction of the age&#x27;) from , (&#x27;end of the gods&#x27;) from , and, in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, (&#x27;when the sons of Muspell move into battle&#x27;) can be found in chapters 18 and 36 of .

==Presence in literature==
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===
The &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; contains various references to :



In the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; poem , references to begin from stanza 40 until 58, with the rest of the poem describing the aftermath. In the poem, a (a female seer) recites information to Odin. In stanza 41, the says:
The then describes three roosters crowing: In stanza 42, the herdsman Eggthér sits on a mound and cheerfully plays his harp while the crimson rooster Fjalar (Old Norse &quot;hider, deceiver&quot;) crows in the forest Gálgviðr. The golden rooster Gullinkambi crows to the Æsir in Valhalla, and the third, unnamed soot-red rooster crows in the halls of the underworld location of Hel in stanza 43.

After these stanzas, the further relates that the hound Garmr produces deep howls in front of the cave of Gnipahellir. Garmr&#x27;s bindings break and he runs free. The describes the state of humanity:
The &quot;sons of Mím&quot; are described as being &quot;at play,&quot; though this reference is not further explained in surviving sources. Heimdall raises the Gjallarhorn into the air and blows deeply into it, and Odin converses with Mím&#x27;s head. The world tree Yggdrasil shudders and groans. The Hrym comes from the east, his shield before him. The Midgard serpent Jörmungandr furiously writhes, causing waves to crash. &quot;The eagle shrieks, pale-beaked he tears the corpse,&quot; and the ship Naglfar breaks free thanks to the waves made by Jormungandr and sets sail from the east. The fire inhabitants of Muspelheim come forth.

The continues that Jötunheimr, the land of the , is aroar, and that the Æsir are in council. The dwarfs groan by their stone doors. Surtr advances from the south, his sword brighter than the sun. Rocky cliffs open and the women sink.

The gods then do battle with the invaders: Odin is swallowed whole and alive fighting the wolf Fenrir, causing his wife Frigg her second great sorrow (the first being the death of her son, the god Baldr). Odin&#x27;s son Víðarr avenges his father by rending Fenrir&#x27;s jaws apart and stabbing it in the heart with his spear, thus killing the wolf. The serpent Jörmungandr opens its gaping maw, yawning widely in the air, and is met in combat by Thor. Thor, also a son of Odin and described here as protector of the earth, furiously fights the serpent, defeating it, but Thor is only able to take nine steps afterwards before collapsing dead from the Serpent&#x27;s venom. The god Freyr fights Surtr and loses. After this, people flee their homes, and the sun becomes black while the earth sinks into the sea, the stars vanish, steam rises, and flames touch the heavens.

The sees the earth reappearing from the water and an eagle over a waterfall hunting fish on a mountain. The surviving Æsir meet together at the field of Iðavöllr. They discuss Jörmungandr, great events of the past, and the runic alphabet. In stanza 61, in the grass, they find the golden game pieces that the gods are described as having once happily enjoyed playing games with long ago (attested earlier in the same poem). The reemerged fields grow without needing to be sown. The gods Höðr and Baldr return from Hel and live happily together.

The says that the god Hœnir chooses wooden slips for divination and that the sons of two brothers will widely inhabit the windy world. She sees a hall thatched with gold in Gimlé, where nobility will live and spend their lives pleasurably. Stanzas 65, found in the version of the poem, refers to a &quot;powerful, mighty one&quot; that &quot;rules over everything&quot; and who will arrive from above at the court of the gods (Old Norse ), which has been interpreted as a Christian addition to the poem. In stanza 66, the ends her account with a description of the dragon Níðhöggr, corpses in his jaws, flying through the air. The then &quot;sinks down.&quot; It is unclear if stanza 66 indicates that the is referring to the present time or if this is an element of the post- world.

The Vanir god Njörðr is mentioned in relation to in stanza 39 of the poem &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;. In the poem, Odin, disguised as Gagnráðr, faces off with the wise Vafþrúðnir in a battle of wits. Vafþrúðnismál references Njörðr&#x27;s status as a hostage during the earlier Æsir–Vanir War, and that he will &quot;come back home among the wise Vanir&quot; at &quot;the doom of men.&quot;

In stanza 44, Odin poses the question to Vafþrúðnir as to who of mankind will survive the &quot;famous&quot; (&quot;Mighty Winter&quot;). Vafþrúðnir responds in stanza 45 that those survivors will be Líf and Lífþrasir and that they will hide in the forest of , that they will consume the morning dew, and will produce generations of offspring. In stanza 46, Odin asks what sun will come into the sky after Fenrir has consumed the sun that exists. Vafþrúðnir responds that Sól will bear a daughter before Fenrir assails her and that after this daughter will continue her mother&#x27;s path.

In stanza 51, Vafþrúðnir states that, after Surtr&#x27;s flames have been sated, Odin&#x27;s sons Víðarr and Váli will live in the temples of the gods, and that Thor&#x27;s sons Móði and Magni will possess the hammer Mjolnir. In stanza 52, the disguised Odin asks the about his fate. Vafþrúðnir responds that &quot;the wolf&quot; will consume Odin, and that Víðarr will avenge him by sundering its cold jaws in battle. Odin ends the duel with one final question: what did Odin say to his son before preparing his funeral pyre? With this, Vafþrúðnir realizes that he is dealing with none other than Odin, whom he refers to as &quot;the wisest of beings,&quot; adding that Odin alone could know this. Odin&#x27;s message has been interpreted as a promise of resurrection to Baldr after .
 is briefly referenced in stanza 40 of the poem . Here, the valkyrie Sigrún&#x27;s unnamed maid is passing the deceased hero Helgi Hundingsbane&#x27;s burial mound. Helgi is there with a retinue of men, surprising the maid. The maid asks if she is witnessing a delusion since she sees dead men riding, or if has occurred. In stanza 41, Helgi responds that it is neither.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===
Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot; quotes heavily from and elaborates extensively in prose on the information there, though some of this information conflicts with that provided in .

====&quot;Gylfaginning&quot; chapters 26 and 34====
In the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; book &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, various references are made to . is first mentioned in chapter 26, where the throned figure of High, king of the hall, tells Gangleri (King Gylfi in disguise) some basic information about the goddess Iðunn, including that her apples will keep the gods young until .

In chapter 34, High describes the binding of the wolf Fenrir by the gods, causing the god Týr to lose his right hand, and that Fenrir remains there until . Gangleri asks High why, since the gods could only expect destruction from Fenrir, they did not simply kill Fenrir once he was bound. High responds that &quot;the gods hold their sacred places and sanctuaries in such respect that they chose not to defile them with the wolf&#x27;s blood, even though the prophecies foretold that he would be the death of Odin.&quot;

As a consequence of his role in the death of the god Baldr, Loki (described as father of Fenrir) is bound on top of three stones with the internal organs of his son Narfi (which are turned into iron) in three places. There, venom drops onto his face periodically from a snake placed by the Skaði. Loki&#x27;s wife Sigyn collects the venom into a bucket, but whenever she leaves to empty it, the drops reach Loki&#x27;s face, and the pain he experiences causes convulsions, resulting in earthquakes. Loki is further described as being bound this way until the onset of .

==== chapter 51====
Chapter 51 provides a detailed account of interspersed with various quotes from , while chapters 52 and 53 describe the aftermath of these events. In Chapter 51, High states that the first sign of will be , during which time three winters will arrive without a summer, and the sun will be useless. High details that, before these winters, three earlier winters will have occurred, marked with great battles throughout the world. During this time, greed will cause brothers to kill brothers, and fathers and sons will suffer from the collapse of kinship bonds. High then quotes stanza 45 of . Next, High describes that the wolf will swallow the sun, then his brother will swallow the moon, and mankind will consider the occurrence as a great disaster resulting in much ruin. The stars will disappear. The earth and mountains will shake so violently that the trees will come loose from the soil, the mountains will topple, and all restraints will break, causing Fenrir to break free from his bonds.

High relates that the great serpent Jörmungandr, also described as a child of Loki in the same source, will breach land as the sea violently swells onto it. The ship Naglfar, described in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot; as being made from the human nails of the dead, is released from its mooring and sets sail on the surging sea, steered by a named Hrym. At the same time, Fenrir, eyes and nostrils spraying flames, charges forward with his mouth wide open, his upper jaw reaching to the heavens, and his lower jaw touching the earth. At Fenrir&#x27;s side, Jörmungandr sprays venom throughout the air and the sea.

During all of this, the sky splits into two. From the split, the &quot;sons of Muspell&quot; ride forth. Surtr rides first, surrounded by flames, his sword brighter than the sun. High says that &quot;Muspell&#x27;s sons&quot; will ride across Bifröst, described in as a rainbow bridge, and that the bridge will then break. The sons of Muspell (and their shining battle troop) advance to the field of Vígríðr, described as an expanse that reaches &quot;a hundred leagues in each direction,&quot; where Fenrir, Jörmungandr, Loki (followed by &quot;Hel&#x27;s own&quot;), and Hrym (accompanied by all frost ) join them. While this occurs, Heimdallr stands and blows the Gjallarhorn with all his might. The gods awaken at the sound, and they meet. Odin rides to Mímisbrunnr in search of counsel from Mímir. Yggdrasil shakes, and everything, everywhere fears.

High relates that the Æsir and the Einherjar dress for war and head to the field. Odin, wearing a gold helmet and an intricate coat of mail, carries his spear Gungnir and rides before them. Odin advances against Fenrir, while Thor moves at his side, though Thor is unable to assist Odin because he has engaged Jörmungandr in combat. According to High, Freyr fights fiercely with Surtr, but falls because he lacks the sword he once gave to his messenger, Skírnir. The hound Garmr (described here as the &quot;worst of monsters&quot;) breaks free from his bonds in front of Gnipahellir, and fights the god Týr, resulting in both of their deaths.

Thor kills Jörmungandr but is poisoned by the serpent, and manages to walk only nine steps before falling to the earth dead. Fenrir swallows Odin, though immediately afterwards his son Víðarr kicks his foot into Fenrir&#x27;s lower jaw, grips the upper jaw, and rips apart Fenrir&#x27;s mouth, killing the great wolf. Loki fights Heimdallr and the two kill each other. Surtr covers the earth in fire, causing the entire world to burn. High quotes stanzas 46 to 47 of , and additionally stanza 18 of (the latter relating information about the battlefield Vígríðr).

====&quot;Gylfaginning&quot; chapters 52 and 53====
At the beginning of chapter 52, Gangleri asks &quot;what will be after heaven and earth and the whole world are burned? All the gods will be dead, together with the Einherjar and the whole of mankind. Didn&#x27;t you say earlier that each person will live in some world throughout all ages?&quot;

The figure of Third, seated on the highest throne in the hall, responds that there will be many good places to live, but also many bad ones. Third states that the best place to be is Gimlé in the heavens, where a place exists called Okolnir that houses a hall called Brimir—where one can find plenty to drink. Third describes a hall made of red gold located in Niðafjöll called Sindri, where &quot;good and virtuous men will live.&quot; Third further relates an unnamed hall in Náströnd, the beaches of the dead, that he describes as a large repugnant hall facing north that is built from the spines of snakes, and resembles &quot;a house with walls woven from branches&quot;; the heads of the snakes face the inside of the house and spew so much venom that rivers of it flow throughout the hall, in which oath breakers and murderers must wade. Third here quotes stanzas 38 to 39, with the insertion of original prose stating that the worst place of all to be is in Hvergelmir, followed by a quote from to highlight that the dragon Níðhöggr harasses the corpses of the dead there.

Chapter 53 begins with Gangleri asking if any of the gods will survive and if there will be anything left of the earth or the sky. High responds that the earth will appear once more from the sea, beautiful and green, where self-sown crops grow. The field Iðavöllr exists where Asgard once was, and, there, untouched by Surtr&#x27;s flames, Víðarr and Váli reside. Now possessing their father&#x27;s hammer Mjölnir, Thor&#x27;s sons Móði and Magni will meet them there, and, coming from Hel, Baldr and Höðr also arrive. Together, they all sit and recount memories, later finding the gold game pieces the Æsir once owned. stanza 51 is then quoted.

High reveals that two humans, Líf and Lífþrasir, will have also survived the destruction by hiding in the wood Hoddmímis holt. These two survivors consume the morning dew for sustenance, and from their descendants, the world will be repopulated. stanza 45 is then quoted. The personified sun, Sól, will have a daughter at least as beautiful as she, and this daughter will follow the same path as her mother. stanza 47 is quoted, and so ends the foretelling of in .

==Archaeological record==

Various objects have been identified as depicting events from .

===Thorwald&#x27;s Cross===
Thorwald&#x27;s Cross, a partially surviving runestone erected at Kirk Andreas on the Isle of Man, depicts a bearded human holding a spear downward at a wolf, his right foot in its mouth, while a large bird sits at his shoulder. Rundata dates it to 940, while Pluskowski dates it to the 11th century. This depiction has been interpreted as Odin, with a raven or eagle at his shoulder, being consumed by Fenrir at . On the other side of the stone is a depiction of a large cross and another image parallel to the Odin figure that has been described as Christ triumphing over Satan. These combined elements have led to the cross as being described as &quot;syncretic art,&quot; a mixture of pagan and Christian beliefs.

===Gosforth Cross===

The Gosforth Cross (920–950), in Cumbria, England, is a standing cross of a typical Anglo-Saxon form, carved on all sides of the long shaft, which is nearly square in section. Based on the mythological stories found in Old Norse texts written in Iceland in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, it has been assumed that the figural carvings of the Gosforth Cross depict Norse mythological episodes connected to Ragnarök. Apart from panels of ornament, the scenes include a Christian crucifixion, and possibly another scene in Hell, but the other scenes are generally interpreted as narrative incidents from the story, even by a scholar as cautious of such interpretations as David M. Wilson. The battle itself may be depicted on the north side. The cross features various figures depicted in Borre style, including a man with a spear facing a monstrous head, with one foot thrust into the beast&#x27;s forked tongue and on its lower jaw, and the other is against its upper jaw, a scene interpreted as Víðarr fighting Fenrir.

===Ledberg stone===
The 11th-century Ledberg stone in Sweden, similarly to Thorwald&#x27;s Cross, is regarded as alluding to the final battle of Ragnarök through the stones images. The stone features a figure with his foot at the mouth of a four-legged beast, and this may also be a depiction of Odin being devoured by Fenrir at . Below the beast and the man is a depiction of a legless, helmeted man, with his arms in a prostrate position. The Younger Futhark inscription on the stone bears a commonly seen memorial dedication, but is followed by an encoded runic sequence that has been described as &quot;mysterious,&quot; and &quot;an interesting magic formula which is known from all over the ancient Norse world.&quot; 

===Skarpåker stone===
On the early 11th-century Skarpåker Stone, from Södermanland, Sweden, a father grieving his dead son used the same verse form, , as in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; in the following engraving:

Jansson (1987) notes that at the time of the inscription, everyone who read the lines would have thought of and the allusion that the father found fitting as an expression of his grief. The inscription on the stone depicts a time of religious transition in Viking Age Scandinavia by fusing Christian and Norse components. The presence of a Christian cross on the stone indicates an attempt to combine Norse prophetic themes with Christian concepts of resurrection and endless life. The ship on the stone, with its mast shaped like a cross, is believed to represent the trip to the afterlife, fusing Christian imagery with Viking Age culture.

==Theories and interpretations==

===Cyclic time and &quot;Hoddmímis holt&quot;===
Rudolf Simek theorizes that the survival of Líf and Lífþrasir at the end of is &quot;a case of reduplication of the anthropogeny, understandable from the cyclic nature of the Eddic eschatology.&quot; Simek says that Hoddmímis holt &quot;should not be understood literally as a wood or even a forest in which the two keep themselves hidden, but rather as an alternative name for the world-tree Yggdrasill. Thus, the creation of mankind from tree trunks (Askr, Embla) is repeated after the as well.&quot; Simek says that in Germanic regions, the concept of mankind originating from trees is ancient, and additionally points out legendary parallels in a Bavarian legend of a shepherd who lives inside a tree, whose descendants repopulate the land after life there has been wiped out by plague (citing a retelling by F. R. Schröder). In addition, Simek points to an Old Norse parallel in the figure of Örvar-Oddr, &quot;who is rejuvenated after living as a tree-man (&quot;Ǫrvar-Odds saga&quot; 24–27).&quot;

===, , and Christianity===
Theories have been proposed about the relation between and the 9th-century Old High German epic poem &quot;Muspilli&quot; about the Christian Last Judgment, where the word appears, and the 9th-century Old Saxon epic poem about the life of Christ, where various other forms of the word appear. In both sources, the word is used to signify the end of the world through fire. The Christian thought of the Last Judgment as it is presented in the Book of Revelation is similar to the apocalyptic story of Ragnarök, which features imagery of a final cosmic conflict, devastation, and eventual renewal. Key elements, such as the role of a savior figure and the contrast between divine forces and evil, may mirror Christian theological concepts brought during the conversion of Scandinavia. Old Norse forms of the term also appear throughout accounts of , where the world is also consumed in flames, and, though various theories exist about the meaning and origins of the term, its etymology has not been solved. 

===Proto-Indo-European basis===
Parallels have been pointed out between the of Norse religion and the beliefs of other related Indo-European peoples. Subsequently, theories have been put forth that represents a later evolution of a Proto-Indo-European belief along with other cultures descending from the Proto-Indo-Europeans. These parallels include comparisons of a cosmic winter motif between the Norse , the Iranian and . Víðarr&#x27;s stride has been compared to the Vedic god Vishnu in that both have a &quot;cosmic stride&quot; with a special shoe used to tear apart a beastly wolf. Larger patterns have also been drawn between &quot;final battle&quot; events in Indo-European cultures, including the occurrence of a blind or semi-blind figure in &quot;final battle&quot; themes, and figures appearing suddenly with surprising skills. 

Similar Indo-European mythological elements are highlighted by comparisons between Ragnarök and Iranian prophetic traditions. The wolves&#x27; destruction of the sun and moon in Völuspá is consistent with Iranian customs about the Fravashi, divine guardians who intervene against demonic powers to guarantee the sun and moon&#x27;s paths. Iranian traditions depict this conflict as a part of the world&#x27;s continuous war between good and evil, whereas Scandinavian mythology depicts the cosmic catastrophe as taking place at the end of time. These parallels highlight a common cosmological concern for upholding order in the face of chaotic forces. Ragnarök epitomizes the Old Norse warrior culture, in which bravery and resistance are used to face death&#x27;s inevitable course. Gods such as Odin and Thor represent the ideal warrior archetypes, and the tale reflects a deeply ingrained cultural ideal of heroic tenacity. This philosophy supported a worldview in which destruction is not an end but a necessary prerequisite for rebirth. Iranian traditions share similarities with Ragnarök&#x27;s warrior ethos. Warriors are portrayed in both mythologies as seeking for a spot in paradise, which is known as Valhalla in Norse mythology. This shared ideal reinforces the relationship between apocalyptic myths and societal ideals in Indo-European traditions by reflecting a cultural emphasis on the afterlife as a compensation for bravery and devotion in combat.

===Volcanic eruptions===
Hilda Ellis Davidson theorizes that the events in occurring after the death of the gods (the sun turning black, steam rising, flames touching the heavens, etc.) may be inspired by the volcanic eruptions on Iceland. Records of eruptions in Iceland bear strong similarities to the sequence of events described in , especially the eruption at Laki that occurred in 1783. Bertha Phillpotts theorizes that the figure of Surtr was inspired by Icelandic eruptions and that he was a volcano demon. Surtr&#x27;s name occurs in some Icelandic place names, among them the lava tube Surtshellir, a number of dark caverns in the volcanic central region of Iceland. This viewpoint is expanded by recent research by Mathias Nordvig and Felix Riede, which connects the apocalyptic themes of Ragnarök to important geological and climatic occurrences in the sixth century AD. Massive volcanic eruptions created a &quot;dust veil&quot; at this time, which produced broad climatic changes throughout the Northern Hemisphere, including as longer periods of darkness and colder temperatures. Known as one of the most intense volcanic winters in history, the years 536–550 AD brought about significant environmental changes in Scandinavia and shifts in settlement patterns during this time of climate disturbance, indicating a social reaction to these environmental issues.
Parallels have been pointed out between a poem spoken by a found in the 13th-century (&quot;the tale of the mountain dweller&quot;). In the tale, Thórd and his servant get lost while travelling to church in winter, and so take shelter for the night within a cave. Inside the cave they hear noises, witness a pair of immense burning eyes, and then the being with burning eyes recites a poem of 12 stanzas. The poem the being recites contains references to Norse mythology (including a mention of Thor) and also prophecies (including that &quot;mountains will tumble, the earth will move, men will be scoured by hot water and burned by fire&quot;). Surtr&#x27;s fire receives a mention in stanza 10. John Lindow says that the poem may describe &quot;a mix of the destruction of the race of giants and of humans, as in &quot; but that &quot;many of the predictions of disruption on earth could also fit the volcanic activity that is so common in Iceland.&quot;

==Modern influences==
The events of Ragnarok are dramatized, albeit briefly, in Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;The Marsh King&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

In late 2013 and early 2014, English-language media outlets widely reported that was foretold to occur on 22 February 2014. Apparently patterned after the 2012 phenomenon, the claim was at times attributed to a &quot;Viking Calendar&quot;. No such calendar is known to have existed, and the source was a &quot;prediction&quot; made to media outlets by the Jorvik Viking Centre in York, England, intended to draw attention to an event that the institution was to hold on that date. The Jorvik Viking Centre was criticized for misleading the public to promote the event. In a 2014 article on the claims, philologist Joseph S. Hopkins perceives the media response as an example of a broad revival of interest in the Viking Age and ancient Germanic topics.

The Norwegian fantasy adventure film &quot;Gåten Ragnarok&quot; was released in 2013 and centres on the discovery of the mythical serpent in contemporary Finnmark.

The myth is central to the 2017 Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;&quot;, at whose climax the demon Surtur destroys Asgard as its people flee into space under the guidance of Thor, Valkyrie, Loki, Heimdall, Hulk, and Korg.

A. S. Byatt published a novel entitled &quot;Ragnarok: The End of the Gods&quot; in 2011.

Ragnarök is set up at the end of the 2018 video game &quot;God of War&quot;, which is rooted in Norse mythology, after the protagonist Kratos kills Baldr. The 2022 sequel, &quot;God of War Ragnarök&quot;, deals with the aftermath of this event and covers the in-game version of Ragnarök.

Norse mythology and climate change inspired the eponymous TV series &quot;Ragnarok&quot;. The town of Edda in Western Norway is plagued by climate change and industrial pollution caused by the factories owned by the Jutul family, a group of . They are challenged by a teenage boy, Magne, the reincarnation of Thor. Thus begins the event Ragnarok (&quot;twilight of the gods&quot;), the fight against those who are destroying the planet.

In the 2020 video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot;, which is partially inspired by Norse mythology, the Æsir are depicted as members of the Isu, who within the series&#x27; fictional lore, are an advanced civilization that predate humanity, and Ragnarök refers to a series of events revolving around the Toba Catastrophe, or the &quot;Great Catastrophe&quot;, which was a solar flare that hit the Earth, killing most of the Isu. In one of the game&#x27;s story arcs, the protagonist Eivor Varinsdottir assumes the role of Odin (later revealed to be her previous life), who searches for a way for himself and the other Æsir to survive beyond Ragnarök, during which they are all foretold to perish. One of the game&#x27;s downloadable content packs, titled &quot;Dawn of Ragnarök&quot;, builds upon this, as it follows Odin just as the events of Ragnarök are about to begin.

<doc id="25830" wikidata="Q2517513" url="?curid=25830" title="Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead">
<text>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is an absurdist, existential tragicomedy by Tom Stoppard, first staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 1966. The play expands upon the exploits of two minor characters from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, the courtiers Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, and the main setting is Denmark.

The action of Stoppard&#x27;s play takes place mainly &quot;in the wings&quot; of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, with brief appearances of major characters from &quot;Hamlet&quot; who enact fragments of the original&#x27;s scenes. Between these episodes, the two protagonists voice their confusion at the progress of events occurring onstage without them in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, of which they have no direct knowledge.

Comparisons have also been drawn with Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, for the presence of two central characters who almost appear to be two halves of a single character. Many plot features are similar as well: the characters pass time by playing Questions, impersonating other characters, and interrupting each other or remaining silent for long periods of time.

==Title==
The title is taken directly from the final scene of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. In an earlier scene, Prince Hamlet has been exiled to England by the treacherous King of Denmark (his uncle Claudius, who has murdered Hamlet&#x27;s father to obtain the throne). En route to England, Hamlet discovers a letter from King Claudius which is being carried to England by Hamlet&#x27;s old but now untrusted friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. The letter commands that Hamlet be put to death upon his arrival in England. Hamlet rewrites the letter to command that instead, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern be put to death. He then escapes back to Denmark. 
By the end of Shakespeare&#x27;s play, Prince Hamlet, Laertes, Ophelia, Polonius, King Claudius, and Queen Gertrude all lie dead.

An ambassador from England arrives on the scene to bluntly report &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead&quot; (&quot;Hamlet&quot;. Act V, Scene II, line 411); they join the stabbed, poisoned and drowned key characters. By the end of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Horatio is the only main figure left alive.

==Characters==
* Rosencrantz and Guildenstern: childhood friends of Hamlet.
* The Player: a travelling actor.
* Hamlet: the Prince of Denmark, nephew to Claudius.
* Tragedians: travelling with the Player, including Alfred. 
* King Claudius: the King of Denmark, Hamlet&#x27;s uncle and stepfather.
* Gertrude: the Queen of Denmark, and Hamlet&#x27;s mother. 
* Polonius: Claudius&#x27;s chief adviser.
* Laertes: Polonius&#x27;s son
* Ophelia: Polonius&#x27;s daughter.
* Horatio: friend of Hamlet.
* Fortinbras: nephew of the King of Norway.

==Synopsis==
With William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot; as the backdrop&quot;,&quot; &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; concerns the musings and mishaps of the titular characters. The play is structured as the inverse of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, in which Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are two minor characters who were childhood friends of the Prince; instead, the duo remains the focus and Hamlet himself is a minor role whose actions occur largely offstage, with the exception of a few short scenes in which the dramatic plays converge.

In &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern operate under the King&#x27;s command in an attempt to discover Hamlet&#x27;s motives and plot against him. Hamlet, however, derisively mocks and outwits them, so that they, rather than he, are sentenced to death in the end. &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot; explores these events from the perspective of the duo; their actions seem largely nonsensical because they are superseded and, therefore, determined by Hamlet&#x27;s plot.

After witnessing a performance of &quot;The Murder of Gonzago&quot; – the play within the play in &quot;Hamlet&quot; – they find themselves on a ship, transporting Prince Hamlet to the King in England, with the troupe that staged the performance also on board as stowaways. They are supposed to give the King a letter with an instruction to execute Hamlet, who discovers this and replaces the letter with another one. During the voyage, the ship is hijacked by pirates, after which it is discovered that Hamlet has disappeared and the letter now instructs the English monarch to execute instead.

The troupe recreates the duel scene from &quot;Hamlet&quot; with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, at the end, accepting &quot;quo fata ferunt&quot; (&quot;whither the fates carry [us]&quot;). The play concludes with the final scene from &quot;Hamlet&quot; in which the English Ambassador arrives and announces that &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead&quot;.

==Summary==

===Act One===
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are betting on coin flips. Rosencrantz, who bets heads each time, wins 92 flips in a row. The extreme unlikeliness of this event according to the laws of probability leads Guildenstern to suggest that they may be &quot;within un-, sub- or supernatural forces&quot;. It is revealed that the duo are journeying to court on the orders of the King. Guildenstern theorizes on the nature of reality, focusing on how an event becomes increasingly real as more people witness it.

A troupe of Tragedians arrives and offers the two men a show. They seem capable only of performances involving s. The next two scenes at court are from the plot of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The first, involving Hamlet and Ophelia, takes place offstage in &quot;Hamlet&quot;—the stage directions repeat exactly the words with which Ophelia describes the event to Polonius in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The second is taken directly from &quot;Hamlet&quot;: Rosencrantz and Guildenstern&#x27;s first appearance in that play. The Danish king and queen, Claudius and Gertrude, ask the two to discover the nature of Hamlet&#x27;s recent madness. The royal couple demonstrate an inability to distinguish the two courtiers from one another, as do the characters themselves (to their irritation).

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern attempt to practise for their meeting with the Prince by one pretending to be Hamlet and the other asking him questions, but they glean no new information from it. The act closes with another scene from &quot;Hamlet&quot; in which they finally meet the Prince face to face.

===Act Two===
The conversation ends between Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and Hamlet. Guildenstern tries to be optimistic, while Rosencrantz admits that the pair made no progress and Hamlet entirely outwitted them.

The Player returns to the stage. He is angry that the pair did not stay to watch their play earlier because, without an audience, his Tragedians are nothing. He tells them to stop questioning their existence because life appears too chaotic to comprehend upon examination. The Player, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern lose themselves in another illogical conversation that demonstrates the limits of language. The Player leaves to prepare for his production of &quot;The Murder of Gonzago&quot;, set to be put on in front of Hamlet and the King and Queen.

Claudius and Gertrude enter and begin another short scene taken directly from &quot;Hamlet&quot;: they ask about the duo&#x27;s encounter with the Prince, and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern inform them about his interest in the Tragedians&#x27; production. After Claudius and Gertrude leave, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern contemplate their job. They see Hamlet walk by but fail to seize the opportunity to interrogate him.

The Tragedians return and perform their dress rehearsal of &quot;The Murder of Gonzago&quot;. Their play moves beyond the scope of what the reader sees in &quot;Hamlet&quot;; characters resembling Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are seen taking a sea voyage and meeting their deaths at the hands of English courtiers, foreshadowing the duo&#x27;s true fate. Rosencrantz does not quite make the connection, but Guildenstern is frightened into a verbal attack on the Tragedians&#x27; inability to capture the real essence of death. The stage becomes dark.

When the stage is once again visible, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern lie in the same position as had the actors portraying their deaths. The duo are upset that they have become the pawns of the royal couple. Claudius enters again and tells them to find where Hamlet has hidden Polonius&#x27;s corpse. After many false starts, they eventually find Hamlet, who leaves with Claudius.

Rosencrantz is delighted to find that his mission is complete, but Guildenstern knows it has not ended. Hamlet enters, speaking with a Norwegian soldier. Rosencrantz decides that he is happy to accompany Hamlet to England because it means freedom from the orders of the Danish court. Guildenstern understands that wherever they go, they are still trapped in this world.

===Act Three===
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern find themselves on a ship that has already set sail. The pair seem to have no knowledge of how they got there. At first, they try to determine whether they are still alive, before they recognize that they are not dead and are on board a boat. They remember that Claudius has given them a letter to deliver to England. After some brief confusion over who actually has the letter, they find it and eventually open it. They realize that Claudius has asked for Hamlet to be killed. While Rosencrantz seems hesitant to follow their orders now, Guildenstern convinces him that they are not worthy of interfering with fate and the plans of kings. The stage darkens and, presumably, the characters go to sleep. Hamlet switches the letter with one he has written himself, an act which takes place offstage in &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

The pair discovers that the Tragedians are hidden (&quot;impossibly&quot;, according to the stage directions) in several barrels on deck. They are fleeing Denmark because their play offended Claudius. When Rosencrantz complains that there is not enough action, pirates attack. Hamlet, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and the Player all hide in separate barrels. The lights dim.

When the lights come on again, Hamlet has vanished (in &quot;Hamlet&quot; it is reported that he was kidnapped by pirates from the ship). Rosencrantz and Guildenstern panic, then re-read the letter to find that it now calls for them to be put to death instead of the prince. Guildenstern cannot understand why he and Rosencrantz are so important as to necessitate their executions.

The Player tells Guildenstern that all paths end in death. Guildenstern snaps and draws the Player&#x27;s dagger from his belt, shouting that his portrayals of death do not do justice to the real thing. He stabs the Player and the Player appears to die. Guildenstern fully believes that he has killed the Player. Seconds later, the Tragedians begin to clap and the Player stands up and bows, revealing the knife to be a theatrical one with a retractable blade. The Tragedians then act out the deaths from the final scene of &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

The lighting shifts so that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern appear alone. Rosencrantz still does not understand why they must die, yet he resigns himself to his fate and he disappears. Guildenstern wonders when he passed the point where he could have stopped the series of events that has brought him to this point. He disappears as well. The final scene features the last few lines from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;, as the Ambassador from England announces that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.

==Motifs and ideas==

===Absurdity===
Stoppard emphasizes the randomness of the world. In the beginning of Act One, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern bet on coin flips and Rosencrantz wins with heads ninety-two times in a row. Guildenstern creates a series of syllogisms in order to interpret this phenomenon, but nothing truly coincides with probability theory.

===Art vs. reality===
The players help demonstrate the conflict between art and reality. The world in which Rosencrantz and Guildenstern live lacks order, but art allows people to create artificial order. As the Player says, &quot;There&#x27;s a design at work in all art.&quot; Art and the real world are in conflict. In order to reach out to the only reality he can be sure of, Guildenstern exclaims, &quot;No one gets up after death—there is no applause—there is only silence and some second-hand clothes, and that&#x27;s death.&quot; Stoppard also uses his characters to comment on the believability of theatre. While Guildenstern criticises the Player for his portrayal of death, he believes the Player&#x27;s performance when Guildenstern thinks he has stabbed him with a knife. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern believe exactly what the actors want them to believe.

===Metatheatre===
Metatheatre is a central structural element of &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;. Scenes that are staged as plays, dumb shows, or commentaries on dramatic theory and practice are prominent in both Stoppard&#x27;s play and Shakespeare&#x27;s original tragedy &quot;Hamlet&quot;. In &quot;Hamlet&quot;, metatheatrical elements include the Player&#x27;s speech (2.2), Hamlet&#x27;s advice to the Players (3.2), and the meta-play &quot;The Mousetrap&quot; (3.3). Since Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are characters from &quot;Hamlet&quot; itself, Stoppard&#x27;s entire play can be considered a piece of metatheatre. Bernardina da Silveira Pinheiro observes that Stoppard uses metatheatrical devices to produce a &quot;parody&quot; of the key elements of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; that includes foregrounding two minor characters considered &quot;nonentities&quot; in the original tragedy.

==Notable productions==

===United Kingdom and Ireland===
The play had its first incarnation as a 1964 one-act titled &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Meet King Lear&quot;. The expanded version under the current title was first staged at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe on 24 August 1966, by the Oxford Theatre Group. The play debuted in London with a production at the Old Vic directed by Derek Goldby, designed by Desmond Heeley, and scored by Marc Wilkinson. It premiered on 11 April 1967, with John Stride as Rosencrantz, Edward Petherbridge as Guildenstern, Graham Crowden as the Player, and John McEnery as Hamlet. The play returned to the National Theatre on 14 December 1995 and this production with Adrian Scarborough as Rosencrantz and Simon Russell Beale as Guildenstern subsequently toured to Belfast, Cork, Bath, Newcastle, Sheffield and Bradford.

In 2011 the play was revived in a production directed by Sir Trevor Nunn, opening at Chichester Festival Theatre before transferring to the Theatre Royal Haymarket in London&#x27;s West End (June–August 2011). It starred Samuel Barnett and Jamie Parker. Tim Curry was originally scheduled to appear as The Player, but dropped out during preview performances at Chichester Festival Theatre due to ill health and was replaced by Chris Andrew Mellon. In 2013, an excerpt of the play was performed by Benedict Cumberbatch (Rosencrantz) and Kobna Holdbrook-Smith (Guildenstern) on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the National Theatre.

From 25 February to 6 May 2017 the play returned to The Old Vic in a production celebrating its 50th anniversary, directed by David Leveaux and starring Daniel Radcliffe as Rosencrantz, Joshua McGuire as Guildenstern and David Haig as The Player.

===Broadway and Off-Broadway===
The Royal National Theatre production of &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern&quot; had a year-long Broadway run from 9 October 1967, through 19 October 1968, initially at the Alvin Theatre, then transferring to the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre on 8 January 1968.

The production, which was Stoppard&#x27;s first on Broadway, totalled eight previews and 420 performances. It was directed by Derek Goldby and designed by Desmond Heeley and starred Paul Hecht as the Player, Brian Murray as Rosencrantz and John Wood as Guildenstern. The play was nominated for eight Tony Awards, and won four: Best Play, Scenic Design, Costume Design and Producer; the director and the three leading actors, all nominated for Tonys, did not win.

The play also won Best Play from the New York Drama Critics Circle in 1968, and Outstanding Production from the Outer Critics Circle in 1969. Clive Barnes of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the play as &quot;very funny, very brilliant, very chilling.&quot;

The play was profiled in the William Goldman book &quot;The Season: A Candid Look at Broadway&quot;.

The play had a 1987 New York revival by Roundabout Theatre at the Union Square Theatre, directed by Robert Carsen and featuring John Wood as the Player, Stephen Lang as Rosencrantz and John Rubinstein as Guildenstern. It ran for 40 performances from 29 April to 28 June 1987.

Several times since 1995, the American Shakespeare Center has mounted repertories that included both &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern&quot;, with the same actors performing the same roles in each; in their 2001 and 2009 seasons the two plays were &quot;directed, designed, and rehearsed together to make the most out of the shared scenes and situations&quot;.

Halifax&#x27;s Neptune Theatre company began a production of the play in January 2024 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and collaborated with Mirvish Productions for a Toronto, Ontario run beginning in March 2024—the latter of which was extended twice before the first production due to high sales. Both runs featured Billy Boyd as Guildenstern, Dominic Monaghan as Rosencrantz, and Michael Blake as the Player, with the Toronto Star describing them as &quot;a trio of brilliant performances&quot; and awarding the production 3.5/4 stars.

=== Other worldwide productions ===
In 2013, Sydney Theatre Company presented a production directed by Simon Phillips with a cast featuring Tim Minchin as Rosencrantz and Toby Schmitz as Guildenstern from 6 August to 7 September 2013.

===Radio adaptations===
The play has been adapted three times for BBC Radio:
* 24 December 1978, an adaptation by Stoppard himself, directed by John Tydeman; the cast included Edward Petherbridge as Guildenstern, Edward Hardwicke as Rosencrantz, Freddie Jones as The Player, Robert Lang as Claudius, Maxine Audley as Gertrude, Angela Pleasence as Ophelia, and Martin Jarvis as Hamlet.
* 15 July 2007 as part of a celebration of Stoppard&#x27;s 70th birthday, another version of Stoppard&#x27;s adaptation, this time directed by Peter Kavanagh; the cast included Danny Webb as Rosencrantz, Andrew Lincoln as Guildenstern, Desmond Barrit as The Player, John Rowe as Polonius, Abigail Hollick as Ophelia, Liza Sadovy as Gertrude, Simon Treves as Claudius and John Dougall as Hamlet.
* A two-part adaptation broadcast 30 and 31 March 2019 on BBC Radio 4, directed by Emma Harding; the cast included Mathew Baynton as Rosencrantz, Andrew Buchan as Guildenstern, Toby Jones as The Player, Sam Dale as Tragedian, Ronny Jhutti as Alfred, Sarah Ovens as Ophelia, Michael Bertenshaw as Polonius, Parth Thakerar as Hamlet, Don Gilet as Claudius and Clare Corbett as Gertrude.

A 1983 radio adaptation was broadcast on the BBC World Service on 17 October directed by Gordon House, with Nigel Anthony as Rosencrantz, Nicky Henson as Guildenstern, Jack May as The Player, John Duttine as Hamlet, Peter Vaughan as Claudius, Marcia Warren as Gertrude, Eileen Tully as Ophelia, Cyril Shaps as Polonius and Alex Jennings as a Tragedian.

In June 2022, a production directed by Rosalind Ayres for the L.A. Theatre Works was broadcast from and recorded at the Invisible Studios, West Hollywood. The cast included Adhir Kalyan as Rosencrantz, Matthew Wolf as Guildenstern, Martin Jarvis as The Player, Anna Lyse Erikson as Alfred/Ophelia, Seamus Dever as Hamlet, JD Cullum as Claudius/Soldier, André Sogliuzzo as Polonius/Player-King/Horatio/Ambassador and Susan Sullivan as Gertrude.

===Film adaptation===

Film rights to the play were originally bought by MGM in 1968 for a reported $350,000 plus 10% of the profits. John Boorman was announced as director with Bob Chartoff and Irwin Winkler to produce. The film was not made, however.

The play was eventually adapted for a film released in February 1990, with screenplay and direction by Stoppard. The motion picture is Stoppard&#x27;s only film directing credit: &quot;[I]t began to become clear that it might be a good idea if I did it myself—at least the director wouldn&#x27;t have to keep wondering what the author meant. It just seemed that I&#x27;d be the only person who could treat the play with the necessary disrespect.&quot; The cast included Gary Oldman as Rosencrantz, Tim Roth as Guildenstern, Richard Dreyfuss as the Player, Joanna Roth as Ophelia, Ian Richardson as Polonius, Joanna Miles as Gertrude, Donald Sumpter as Claudius, and Iain Glen as Hamlet.

==Works inspired by &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;==
* A 2022 play &quot;Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are (Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead)&quot; is an irreverent and absurd one-act in which Rosencrantz and Guildenstern realize they are characters in a meta-play written by Tom Stoppard. Subsequently he realizes that he is a character in a meta-meta-play written by Etai Shuchatowitz.
* The 2004 Disney direct-to-video film &quot;The Lion King 1½&quot; shares many features of &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, being a re-telling of the original 1994 film &quot;The Lion King&quot; (itself based largely on the plot of &quot;Hamlet&quot;) from the perspective of the characters Timon and Pumbaa and occasionally featuring major characters and plot points from the original film.
* The 1999 video game &quot;Half-Life: Opposing Force&quot; was inspired by the play, as stated by one of the lead developers. It is an expansion pack to the original &quot;Half-Life&quot; that retells the events from the perspective of a different character, Adrian Shepherd, that features events and plot points from the original game.

<text>In cryptography, RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4, also known as ARC4 or ARCFOUR, meaning Alleged RC4, see below) is a stream cipher. While it is remarkable for its simplicity and speed in software, multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in RC4, rendering it insecure. It is especially vulnerable when the beginning of the output keystream is not discarded, or when nonrandom or related keys are used. Particularly problematic uses of RC4 have led to very insecure protocols such as WEP.

, there is speculation that some state cryptologic agencies may possess the capability to break RC4 when used in the TLS protocol. IETF has published RFC 7465 to prohibit the use of RC4 in TLS; Mozilla and Microsoft have issued similar recommendations.

A number of attempts have been made to strengthen RC4, notably Spritz, RC4A, VMPC, and RC4+.

==History==
RC4 was designed by Ron Rivest of RSA Security in 1987. While it is officially termed &quot;Rivest Cipher 4&quot;, the RC acronym is alternatively understood to stand for &quot;Ron&#x27;s Code&quot; (see also RC2, RC5 and RC6).

RC4 was initially a trade secret, but in September 1994, a description of it was anonymously posted to the Cypherpunks mailing list. It was soon posted on the sci.crypt newsgroup, where it was broken within days by Bob Jenkins. From there, it spread to many sites on the Internet. The leaked code was confirmed to be genuine, as its output was found to match that of proprietary software using licensed RC4. Because the algorithm is known, it is no longer a trade secret. The name &quot;RC4&quot; is trademarked, so RC4 is often referred to as &quot;ARCFOUR&quot; or &quot;ARC4&quot; (meaning &quot;alleged RC4&quot;) to avoid trademark problems. RSA Security has never officially released the algorithm; Rivest has, however, linked to the English Wikipedia article on RC4 in his own course notes in 2008 and confirmed the history of RC4 and its code in a 2014 paper by him.

RC4 became part of some commonly used encryption protocols and standards, such as WEP in 1997 and WPA in 2003/2004 for wireless cards; and SSL in 1995 and its successor TLS in 1999, until it was prohibited for all versions of TLS by RFC 7465 in 2015, due to the RC4 attacks weakening or breaking RC4 used in SSL/TLS. The main factors in RC4&#x27;s success over such a wide range of applications have been its speed and simplicity: efficient implementations in both software and hardware were very easy to develop.

==Description==
RC4 generates a pseudorandom stream of bits (a keystream). As with any stream cipher, these can be used for encryption by combining it with the plaintext using bitwise exclusive or; decryption is performed the same way (since exclusive or with given data is an involution). This is similar to the one-time pad, except that generated &quot;pseudorandom bits&quot;, rather than a prepared stream, are used. 

To generate the keystream, the cipher makes use of a secret internal state which consists of two parts:
# A permutation of all 256 possible bytes (denoted &quot;S&quot; below).
# Two 8-bit index-pointers (denoted &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot;).
The permutation is initialized with a variable-length key, typically between 40 and 2048 bits, using the &quot;key-scheduling&quot; algorithm (KSA). Once this has been completed, the stream of bits is generated using the &quot;pseudo-random generation algorithm&quot; (PRGA).

===Key-scheduling algorithm (KSA)===
The key-scheduling algorithm is used to initialize the permutation in the array &quot;S&quot;. &quot;keylength&quot; is defined as the number of bytes in the key and can be in the range 1 ≤ keylength ≤ 256, typically between 5 and 16, corresponding to a key length of 40–128 bits. First, the array &quot;S&quot; is initialized to the identity permutation. S is then processed for 256 iterations in a similar way to the main PRGA, but also mixes in bytes of the key at the same time.

 for i from 0 to 255
 S[i] := i
 endfor
 j := 0
 for i from 0 to 255
 j := (j + S[i] + key[i mod keylength]) mod 256
 swap values of S[i] and S[j]
 endfor

===Pseudo-random generation algorithm (PRGA)===
For as many iterations as are needed, the PRGA modifies the state and outputs a byte of the keystream. In each iteration, the PRGA: 
* increments ;
* looks up the th element of , , and adds that to ;
* exchanges the values of and , then uses the sum as an index to fetch a third element of (the keystream value below);
* then bitwise exclusive ORed (XORed) with the next byte of the message to produce the next byte of either ciphertext or plaintext.

Each element of S is swapped with another element at least once every 256 iterations.

 i := 0
 j := 0
 while GeneratingOutput:
 i := (i + 1) mod 256
 j := (j + S[i]) mod 256
 swap values of S[i] and S[j]
 t := (S[i] + S[j]) mod 256
 K := S[t]
 output K
 endwhile

Thus, this produces a stream of which are XORed with the to obtain the . So .

===RC4-based random number generators===
Several operating systems include , an API originating in OpenBSD providing access to a random number generator originally based on RC4. The API allows no seeding, as the function initializes itself using /dev/random. The use of RC4 has been phased out in most systems implementing this API. Man pages for the new arc4random include the backronym &quot;A Replacement Call for Random&quot; for ARC4 as a mnemonic, as it provides better random data than rand() does.

* In OpenBSD 5.5, released in May 2014, was modified to use ChaCha20. The implementations of arc4random in FreeBSD, NetBSD also use ChaCha20.
** Linux typically uses glibc, which did not offer &quot;arc4random&quot; until 2022. Instead, a separate library, libbsd, offers the function; it was updated to use ChaCha20 in 2016. In 2022, glibc added its own version of &quot;arc4random&quot;, also based on ChaCha20.
* According to manual pages shipped with the operating system, in the 2017 release of macOS and iOS operating systems, Apple replaced RC4 with AES in its implementation of arc4random. 

Proposed new random number generators are often compared to the RC4 random number generator.

Several attacks on RC4 are able to distinguish its output from a random sequence.

===Implementation===
Many stream ciphers are based on linear-feedback shift registers (LFSRs), which, while efficient in hardware, are less so in software. The design of RC4 avoids the use of LFSRs and is ideal for software implementation, as it requires only byte manipulations. It uses 256 bytes of memory for the state array, S[0] through S[255], k bytes of memory for the key, key[0] through key[k−1], and integer variables, i, j, and K. Performing a modular reduction of some value modulo 256 can be done with a bitwise AND with 255 (which is equivalent to taking the low-order byte of the value in question).

===Test vectors===
These test vectors are not official, but convenient for anyone testing their own RC4 program. The keys and plaintext are ASCII, the keystream and ciphertext are in hexadecimal.

==Security==
Unlike a modern stream cipher (such as those in eSTREAM), RC4 does not take a separate nonce alongside the key. This means that if a single long-term key is to be used to securely encrypt multiple streams, the protocol must specify how to combine the nonce and the long-term key to generate the stream key for RC4. One approach to addressing this is to generate a &quot;fresh&quot; RC4 key by hashing a long-term key with a nonce. However, many applications that use RC4 simply concatenate key and nonce; RC4&#x27;s weak key schedule then gives rise to related-key attacks, like the Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack (which is famous for breaking the WEP standard).
Because RC4 is a stream cipher, it is more malleable than common block ciphers. If not used together with a strong message authentication code (MAC), then encryption is vulnerable to a bit-flipping attack. The cipher is also vulnerable to a stream cipher attack if not implemented correctly.

It is noteworthy, however, that RC4, being a stream cipher, was for a period of time the only common cipher that was immune to the 2011 BEAST attack on TLS 1.0. The attack exploits a known weakness in the way cipher-block chaining mode is used with all of the other ciphers supported by TLS 1.0, which are all block ciphers.

In March 2013, there were new attack scenarios proposed by Isobe, Ohigashi, Watanabe and Morii, as well as AlFardan, Bernstein, Paterson, Poettering and Schuldt that use new statistical biases in RC4 key table to recover plaintext with large number of TLS encryptions.

The use of RC4 in TLS is prohibited by RFC 7465 published in February 2015.

===Roos&#x27; biases and key reconstruction from permutation===
In 1995, Andrew Roos experimentally observed that the first byte of the keystream is correlated with the first three bytes of the key, and the first few bytes of the permutation after the KSA are correlated with some linear combination of the key bytes. These biases remained unexplained until 2007, when Goutam Paul, Siddheshwar Rathi and Subhamoy Maitra proved the keystream–key correlation and, in another work, Goutam Paul and Subhamoy Maitra proved the permutation–key correlations. The latter work also used the permutation–key correlations to design the first algorithm for complete key reconstruction from the final permutation after the KSA, without any assumption on the key or initialization vector. This algorithm has a constant probability of success in a time, which is the square root of the exhaustive key search complexity. Subsequently, many other works have been performed on key reconstruction from RC4 internal states. Subhamoy Maitra and Goutam Paul also showed that the Roos-type biases still persist even when one considers nested permutation indices, like or . These types of biases are used in some of the later key reconstruction methods for increasing the success probability.

===Biased outputs of the RC4===
The keystream generated by the RC4 is biased to varying degrees towards certain sequences, making it vulnerable to distinguishing attacks. The best such attack is due to Itsik Mantin and Adi Shamir, who showed that the second output byte of the cipher was biased toward zero with probability 1/128 (instead of 1/256). This is due to the fact that if the third byte of the original state is zero, and the second byte is not equal to 2, then the second output byte is always zero. Such bias can be detected by observing only 256 bytes.

Souradyuti Paul and Bart Preneel of COSIC showed that the first and the second bytes of the RC4 were also biased. The number of required samples to detect this bias is 225 bytes.

Scott Fluhrer and David McGrew also showed attacks that distinguished the keystream of the RC4 from a random stream given a gigabyte of output.

The complete characterization of a single step of RC4 PRGA was performed by Riddhipratim Basu, Shirshendu Ganguly, Subhamoy Maitra, and Goutam Paul. Considering all the permutations, they proved that the distribution of the output is not uniform given i and j, and as a consequence, information about j is always leaked into the output.

===Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack===
In 2001, a new and surprising discovery was made by Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir: over all the possible RC4 keys, the statistics for the first few bytes of output keystream are strongly non-random, leaking information about the key. If the nonce and long-term key are simply concatenated to generate the RC4 key, this long-term key can be discovered by analysing a large number of messages encrypted with this key. This and related effects were then used to break the WEP (&quot;wired equivalent privacy&quot;) encryption used with 802.11 wireless networks. This caused a scramble for a standards-based replacement for WEP in the 802.11 market and led to the IEEE 802.11i effort and WPA.

Protocols can defend against this attack by discarding the initial portion of the keystream. Such a modified algorithm is traditionally called &quot;RC4-drop[]&quot;, where is the number of initial keystream bytes that are dropped. The SCAN default is = 768 bytes, but a conservative value would be = 3072 bytes.

The Fluhrer, Mantin and Shamir attack does not apply to RC4-based SSL, since SSL generates the encryption keys it uses for RC4 by hashing, meaning that different SSL sessions have unrelated keys.

===Klein&#x27;s attack===
In 2005, Andreas Klein presented an analysis of the RC4 stream cipher, showing more correlations between the RC4 keystream and the key. Erik Tews, Ralf-Philipp Weinmann, and Andrei Pychkine used this analysis to create aircrack-ptw, a tool that cracks 104-bit RC4 used in 128-bit WEP in under a minute. Whereas the Fluhrer, Mantin, and Shamir attack used around 10 million messages, aircrack-ptw can break 104-bit keys in 40,000 frames with 50% probability, or in 85,000 frames with 95% probability.

===Combinatorial problem===
A combinatorial problem related to the number of inputs and outputs of the RC4 cipher was first posed by Itsik Mantin and Adi Shamir in 2001, whereby, of the total 256 elements in the typical state of RC4, if &quot;x&quot; number of elements (&quot;x&quot; ≤ 256) are &quot;only&quot; known (all other elements can be assumed empty), then the maximum number of elements that can be produced deterministically is also in the next 256 rounds. This conjecture was put to rest in 2004 with a formal proof given by Souradyuti Paul and Bart Preneel.

===Royal Holloway attack===
In 2013, a group of security researchers at the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway, University of London reported an attack that can become effective using only 234 encrypted messages. While yet not a practical attack for most purposes, this result is sufficiently close to one that it has led to speculation that it is plausible that some state cryptologic agencies may already have better attacks that render RC4 insecure. Given that, , a large amount of TLS traffic uses RC4 to avoid attacks on block ciphers that use cipher block chaining, if these hypothetical better attacks exist, then this would make the TLS-with-RC4 combination insecure against such attackers in a large number of practical scenarios.

In March 2015, researcher to Royal Holloway announced improvements to their attack, providing a 226 attack against passwords encrypted with RC4, as used in TLS.

===Bar mitzvah attack===

At the Black Hat Asia 2015 Conference, Itsik Mantin presented another attack against SSL using RC4 cipher.

===NOMORE attack===
In 2015, security researchers from KU Leuven presented new attacks against RC4 in both TLS and WPA-TKIP. Dubbed the Numerous Occurrence MOnitoring &amp; Recovery Exploit (NOMORE) attack, it is the first attack of its kind that was demonstrated in practice. Their attack against TLS can decrypt a secure HTTP cookie within 75 hours. The attack against WPA-TKIP can be completed within an hour and allows an attacker to decrypt and inject arbitrary packets.

==RC4 variants==
As mentioned above, the most important weakness of RC4 comes from the insufficient key schedule; the first bytes of output reveal information about the key. This can be corrected by simply discarding some initial portion of the output stream. This is known as RC4-drop&quot;N&quot;, where &quot;N&quot; is typically a multiple of 256, such as 768 or 1024.

A number of attempts have been made to strengthen RC4, notably Spritz, RC4A, VMPC, and RC4+.

===RC4A===
Souradyuti Paul and Bart Preneel have proposed an RC4 variant, which they call RC4A.

RC4A uses two state arrays and , and two indexes and . Each time is incremented, two bytes are generated:
# First, the basic RC4 algorithm is performed using and , but in the last step, is looked up in .
# Second, the operation is repeated (without incrementing again) on and , and is output.

Thus, the algorithm is:

 &quot;All arithmetic is performed modulo 256&quot;
 i := 0
 j1 := 0
 j2 := 0
 while GeneratingOutput:
 i := i + 1
 j1 := j1 + S1[i]
 swap values of S1[i] and S1[j1]
 output S2[S1[i] + S1[j1]]
 j2 := j2 + S2[i]
 swap values of S2[i] and S2[j2]
 output S1[S2[i] + S2[j2]]
 endwhile

Although the algorithm required the same number of operations per output byte, there is greater parallelism than RC4, providing a possible speed improvement.

Although stronger than RC4, this algorithm has also been attacked, with Alexander Maximov and a team from NEC developing ways to distinguish its output from a truly random sequence.

===VMPC===

Variably Modified Permutation Composition (VMPC) is another RC4 variant. It uses similar key schedule as RC4, with
 iterating 3 × 256 = 768 times rather than 256, and with an optional additional 768 iterations to incorporate an initial vector. The output generation function operates as follows:

 &quot;All arithmetic is performed modulo 256.&quot;
 i := 0
 while GeneratingOutput:
 a := S[i]
 j := S[j + a]
 output S[S[S[j] + 1]]
 Swap S[i] and S[j] (&quot;b := S[j]; S[i] := b; S[j] := a)&quot;)
 i := i + 1
 endwhile

This was attacked in the same papers as RC4A, and can be distinguished within 238 output bytes.

===RC4+===
RC4+ is a modified version of RC4 with a more complex three-phase key schedule (taking about three times as long as RC4, or the same as RC4-drop512), and a more complex output function which performs four additional lookups in the S array for each byte output, taking approximately 1.7 times as long as basic RC4.

 &quot;All arithmetic modulo 256. &quot;«&quot; and &quot;»&quot; are left and right shift, &quot;⊕&quot; is exclusive OR&quot;
 while GeneratingOutput:
 i := i + 1
 a := S[i]
 j := j + a
 Swap S[i] and S[j] (&quot;b := S[j]; S[j] := S[i]; S[i] := b;&quot;)
 c := S[i«5 ⊕ j»3] + S[j«5 ⊕ i»3]
 output (S[a+b] + S[c⊕0xAA]) ⊕ S[j+b]
 endwhile

This algorithm has not been analyzed significantly.

===Spritz===

In 2014, Ronald Rivest gave a talk and co-wrote a paper on an updated redesign called Spritz. A hardware accelerator of Spritz was published in Secrypt, 2016 and shows that due to multiple nested calls required to produce output bytes, Spritz performs rather slowly compared to other hash functions such as SHA-3 and the best known hardware implementation of RC4.

Like other sponge functions, Spritz can be used to build a cryptographic hash function, a deterministic random bit generator (DRBG), an encryption algorithm that supports authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD), etc.

In 2016, Banik and Isobe proposed an attack that can distinguish Spritz from random noise. In 2017, Banik, Isobe, and Morii proprosed a simple fix that removes the distinguisher in the first two keystream bytes, requiring only one additional memory access without diminishing software performance substantially.

==RC4-based protocols==
* WEP
* TKIP (default algorithm for WPA, but can be configured to use AES-CCMP instead of RC4)
* BitTorrent protocol encryption
* Microsoft Office XP (insecure implementation since nonce remains unchanged when documents get modified)
* Microsoft Point-to-Point Encryption
* Transport Layer Security / Secure Sockets Layer (was optional and then the use of RC4 was prohibited in RFC 7465)
* Secure Shell (optionally)
* Remote Desktop Protocol (optionally)
* Kerberos (optionally)
* SASL Mechanism Digest-MD5 (optionally, &quot;historic&quot;, obsoleted in RFC 6331)
* Gpcode.AK, an early June 2008 computer virus for Microsoft Windows, which takes documents hostage for ransom by obscuring them with RC4 and RSA-1024 encryption
* PDF
* Skype (in modified form)

Where a protocol is marked with &quot;(optionally)&quot;, RC4 is one of multiple ciphers the system can be configured to use.

<text>Sir Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, songwriter and actor who achieved international fame as the drummer for the Beatles. Starr occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;. He also wrote and sang the Beatles songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass Me By&quot; and &quot;Octopus&#x27;s Garden&quot;, and is credited as a co-writer of four others.

Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, with periods of prolonged hospitalisation. As a teenager Starr became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll around early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes when he was asked to join the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best.

In addition to the Beatles&#x27; films, Starr has acted in numerous others. After the Beatles disbanded, he released several successful singles including the US top-ten hit &quot;It Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot;, and number ones &quot;Photograph&quot; and &quot;You&#x27;re Sixteen&quot;. His most successful UK single was &quot;Back Off Boogaloo&quot;, which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album &quot;Ringo&quot;, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US. Starr has also featured in numerous documentaries, hosted television shows, narrated the first two series of the children&#x27;s television programme &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; and portrayed &quot;Mr. Conductor&quot; during the first season of the PBS children&#x27;s television series &quot;Shining Time Station&quot;. Since 1989, he has toured with thirteen variations of Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band.

Starr&#x27;s playing style, which emphasised feel over technical virtuosity, influenced many drummers to reconsider their playing from a compositional perspective. He also influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings. In his opinion, his finest recorded performance was on the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Rain&quot;. In 1999, he was inducted into the &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; Hall of Fame. In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers named him the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. He was inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a Beatle in 1988 and as a solo artist in 2015, and appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music.

==Early life==

Richard Starkey was born on 7 July 1940 at 9 Madryn Street in Dingle, an inner-city area of Liverpool. He is the only child of confectioners Richard Starkey (1 October 1913 – 5 December 1981) and Elsie Gleave (19 October 1914 – 1 January 1987). Elsie enjoyed singing and dancing, a hobby that she shared with her husband, an avid fan of swing. Prior to the birth of their son, whom they called &quot;Ritchie&quot;, the couple had spent much of their free time on the local ballroom circuit, but their regular outings ended soon after his birth. Elsie adopted an overprotective approach to raising her son that bordered on fixation. Subsequently, &quot;Big Ritchie&quot;, as Starkey&#x27;s father became known, lost interest in his family, choosing instead to spend long hours drinking and dancing in pubs, sometimes for several consecutive days.

In an effort to reduce their housing costs, his family moved in 1944 to another neighbourhood in the Dingle, Admiral Grove; soon afterwards his parents separated, and they divorced within the year. Starkey later stated that he has &quot;no real memories&quot; of his father, who made little effort to bond with him, visiting as few as three times thereafter. Elsie found it difficult to survive on her ex-husband&#x27;s support payments of thirty shillings a week, so she took on several menial jobs cleaning houses before securing a position as a barmaid, an occupation that she held for twelve years.
At the age of six, Starkey developed appendicitis. Following a routine appendectomy he contracted peritonitis, causing him to fall into a coma that lasted days. His recovery spanned twelve months, which he spent away from his family at Liverpool&#x27;s Myrtle Street children&#x27;s hospital. Upon his discharge in May 1948, his mother allowed him to stay at home, causing him to miss school. At age eight, he remained illiterate, with a poor grasp of mathematics. His lack of education contributed to a feeling of alienation at school, which resulted in his regularly playing truant at Sefton Park. After several years of twice-weekly tutoring from his surrogate sister and neighbour, Marie Maguire Crawford, Starkey had nearly caught up to his peers academically, but in 1953, he contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium, where he remained for two years. During his stay the medical staff made an effort to stimulate motor activity and relieve boredom by encouraging their patients to join the hospital band, leading to his first exposure to a percussion instrument: a makeshift mallet made from a cotton bobbin that he used to strike the cabinets next to his bed. Soon afterwards, he grew increasingly interested in drumming, receiving a copy of the Alyn Ainsworth song &quot;Bedtime for Drums&quot; as a convalescence gift from Crawford. Starkey commented: &quot;I was in the hospital band ... That&#x27;s where I really started playing. I never wanted anything else from there on ... My grandparents gave me a mandolin and a banjo, but I didn&#x27;t want them. My grandfather gave me a harmonica ... we had a piano – nothing. Only the drums.&quot;

Starkey attended St Silas, a Church of England primary school near his house where his classmates nicknamed him &quot;Lazarus&quot;, and later Dingle Vale Secondary modern school, where he showed an aptitude for art and drama, as well as practical subjects including mechanics. As a result of the prolonged hospitalisations, he fell behind his peers scholastically and was ineligible for the 11-plus qualifying examination required for attendance at a grammar school. After the extended hospital stay following Starkey&#x27;s recovery from tuberculosis, he did not return to school, preferring instead to stay at home and listen to music while playing along by beating biscuit tins with sticks. On 17 April 1954, Starkey&#x27;s mother married Harry Graves at the register office on Mount Pleasant, Liverpool. He was an ex-Londoner who had moved to Liverpool following the failure of his first marriage. Graves, an impassioned fan of big band music and their vocalists, introduced Starkey to recordings by Dinah Shore, Sarah Vaughan and Billy Daniels. Graves stated that he and &quot;Ritchie&quot; never had an unpleasant exchange between them; Starkey later commented: &quot;He was great ... I learned gentleness from Harry.&quot;

Beatles biographer Bob Spitz described Starkey&#x27;s upbringing as &quot;a Dickensian chronicle of misfortune&quot;. Houses in the area were &quot;poorly ventilated, postage-stamp-sized ... patched together by crumbling plaster walls, with a rear door that opened onto an outhouse.&quot; Crawford commented: &quot;Like all of the families who lived in the Dingle, he was part of an ongoing struggle to survive.&quot; The children who lived there spent much of their time at Prince&#x27;s Park, escaping the soot-filled air of their coal-fuelled neighbourhood. Adding to their difficult circumstances, violent crime was an almost constant concern for people living in one of the oldest and poorest inner-city districts in Liverpool. Starkey later commented: &quot;You kept your head down, your eyes open, and you didn&#x27;t get in anybody&#x27;s way.&quot;

After his return home from the sanatorium in late 1955, Starkey entered the workforce but was lacking in motivation and discipline; his initial attempts at gainful employment proved unsuccessful. In an effort to secure himself some warm clothes, he briefly held a railway worker&#x27;s job with British Rail, which came with an employer-issued suit. He was supplied with a hat but no uniform and, unable to pass the physical examination, he was laid off and granted unemployment benefits. He then found work as a waiter serving drinks on a day boat that travelled from Liverpool to North Wales, but his fear of conscription into military service led him to quit the job, not wanting to give the Royal Navy the impression that he was suitable for seafaring work. In mid-1956, Graves secured Starkey a position as an apprentice machinist at Henry Hunt and Son, a Liverpool school equipment manufacturer. While working at the facility Starkey befriended Roy Trafford, and the two bonded over their shared interest in music. Trafford introduced Starkey to skiffle, and he quickly became a fervent admirer.

== Career ==

=== First bands ===

Soon after Trafford piqued Starkey&#x27;s interest in skiffle, the two began rehearsing songs in the manufacturing plant&#x27;s cellar during their lunch breaks. Trafford recalled: &quot;I played a guitar, and [Ritchie] just made a noise on a box ... Sometimes, he just slapped a biscuit tin with some keys, or banged on the backs of chairs.&quot; The pair were joined by Starkey&#x27;s neighbour and co-worker, the guitarist Eddie Miles, forming the Eddie Miles Band, later renamed Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares after a Liverpool landmark. The band performed popular skiffle songs such as &quot;Rock Island Line&quot; and &quot;Walking Cane&quot;, with Starkey raking a thimble across a washboard, creating primitive, driving rhythms. Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier, and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools. Though the lessons were short-lived, they provided Starkey and Trafford with an introduction that allowed them to dance competently while enjoying nights out on the town.

On Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a second-hand drum kit consisting of a snare drum, bass drum and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from a rubbish bin lid. Although basic and crude, the kit facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, who went on to book prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American rock and roll became popular in the UK.

In November 1959, Starkey joined Al Caldwell&#x27;s Texans, a skiffle group who were looking for someone with a proper drum kit so that the group could transition from one of Liverpool&#x27;s best-known skiffle acts to a full-fledged rock and roll band. They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes shortly before recruiting Starkey. About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore and also because it implied a country and western influence. His singing solos were billed as &quot;Starr Time&quot;.

By early 1960, the Hurricanes had become one of Liverpool&#x27;s leading bands. In May, they were offered a three-month residency at a Butlins holiday camp in Wales. Although initially reluctant to accept the residency and end his five-year machinist apprenticeship that he had begun four years earlier, Starr eventually agreed to the arrangement. The Butlins gig led to other opportunities for the band, including an unpleasant tour of US Air Force bases in France about which Starr commented: &quot;The French don&#x27;t like the British; at least I didn&#x27;t like them.&quot; The Hurricanes became so successful that when initially offered a highly coveted residency in Hamburg, they turned it down because of their prior commitment with Butlins. They eventually accepted, joining the Beatles at Bruno Koschmider″s Kaiserkeller on 1 October 1960, where Starr first met the band. Storm&#x27;s Hurricanes were given top-billing over the Beatles, who also received less pay. Starr performed with the Beatles during a few stand-in engagements while in Hamburg. On 15 October 1960, he drummed with John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison, recording with them for the first time while backing Hurricanes singer Lu Walters on the song &quot;Summertime&quot;. During Starr&#x27;s first stay in Hamburg he also met Tony Sheridan, who valued his drumming abilities to the point of asking Starr to leave the Hurricanes and join his band.

=== The Beatles ===
==== Replacing Best ====

Starr quit Rory Storm and the Hurricanes in January 1962 and briefly joined Sheridan in Hamburg before returning to the Hurricanes for a third season at Butlins. On 14 August, Starr accepted Lennon&#x27;s invitation to join the Beatles. On 16 August, Beatles manager Brian Epstein fired their drummer, Pete Best, who recalled: &quot;He said &#x27;I&#x27;ve got some bad news for you. The boys want you out and Ringo in.&#x27; He said [Beatles producer] George Martin wasn&#x27;t too pleased with my playing [and] the boys thought I didn&#x27;t fit in.&quot; Starr first performed as a member of the Beatles on 18 August 1962, at a horticultural society dance at Port Sunlight. After his appearance at the Cavern Club the following day, Best fans, upset by his firing, held vigils outside his house and at the club shouting &quot;Pete forever! Ringo never!&quot; Harrison received a black eye from one upset fan, and Epstein, whose car tyres they had flattened in anger, temporarily hired a bodyguard.

Starr&#x27;s first recording session as a member of the Beatles took place on 4 September 1962. He stated that Martin had thought that he &quot;was crazy and couldn&#x27;t play ... because I was trying to play the percussion and the drums at the same time, we were just a four-piece band&quot;. For their second recording session with Starr, on 11 September 1962, Martin replaced him with session drummer Andy White while recording takes for what would be the two sides of the Beatles&#x27; first single, &quot;Love Me Do&quot;, backed with &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;. Starr played tambourine on &quot;Love Me Do&quot; and maracas on &quot;P.S. I Love You&quot;. Concerned about his status in the Beatles, he thought: &quot;That&#x27;s the end, they&#x27;re doing a Pete Best on me.&quot; Martin later clarified: &quot;I simply didn&#x27;t know what Ringo was like and I wasn&#x27;t prepared to take any risks.&quot;

By November 1962, Starr had been accepted by Beatles fans, who were now calling for him to sing. He began receiving an amount of fan mail equal to that of the others, which helped to secure his position within the band. Starr considered himself fortunate to be on the same &quot;wavelength&quot; as the other Beatles: &quot;I had to be, or I wouldn&#x27;t have lasted. I had to join them as people as well as a drummer.&quot; He was given a small percentage of Lennon and McCartney&#x27;s publishing company, Northern Songs, but derived his primary income during this period from a one-quarter share of Beatles Ltd, a corporation financed by the band&#x27;s net concert earnings. He commented on the nature of his lifestyle after having achieved success with the Beatles: &quot;I lived in nightclubs for three years. It used to be a non-stop party.&quot; Like his father, Starr became well known for his late-night dancing and he received praise for his skills.

==== Worldwide success ====

During 1963, the Beatles enjoyed increasing popularity in Britain. In January, their second single, &quot;Please Please Me&quot;, followed &quot;Love Me Do&quot; into the UK charts and a successful television appearance on &quot;Thank Your Lucky Stars&quot; earned favourable reviews, leading to a boost in sales and radio play. By the end of the year, the phenomenon known as Beatlemania had spread throughout the country, and by February 1964 the Beatles had become an international success when they performed in New York City on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; to a record 73 million viewers. Starr commented: &quot;In the States I know I went over well. It knocked me out to see and hear the kids waving for me. I&#x27;d made it as a personality ... Our appeal ... is that we&#x27;re ordinary lads.&quot; He was a source of inspiration for several songs written at the time, including Penny Valentine&#x27;s &quot;I Want to Kiss Ringo Goodbye&quot; and Rolf Harris&#x27;s &quot;Ringo for President&quot;. Cher released her first single, &quot;Ringo, I Love You&quot; in 1964 under the pseudonym Bonnie Joe Mason.

In 1964, &quot;I love Ringo&quot; lapel pins were the bestselling Beatles merchandise. The prominent placing of the Ludwig logo on the bass drum of his American import drum kit gave the company such a burst of publicity that it became the dominant drum manufacturer in North America for the next twenty years. During live performances, the Beatles continued the &quot;Starr Time&quot; routine that had been popular among his fans: Lennon would place a microphone in front of Starr&#x27;s kit in preparation for his spotlight moment and audiences would erupt in screams. When the Beatles made their film debut in &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, Starr garnered praise from critics, who considered his delivery of deadpan one-liners and his non-speaking scenes highlights. The extended non-speaking sequences had to be arranged by director Richard Lester because of Starr&#x27;s lack of sleep the previous night; Starr commented: &quot;Because I&#x27;d been drinking all night I was incapable of saying a line.&quot; Epstein attributed Starr&#x27;s acclaim to &quot;the little man&#x27;s quaintness&quot;. After the release of the Beatles&#x27; second feature film, &quot;Help!&quot; (1965), Starr won a &quot;Melody Maker&quot; poll against his fellow Beatles for his performance as the central character in the film.

During an interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; in 1964, Lennon explained that Starr had filled in with the Beatles when Best was ill; Starr replied: &quot;[Best] took little pills to make him ill&quot;. Soon after, Best filed a libel suit against him that lasted four years before the court reached an undisclosed settlement in Best&#x27;s favour. In June, the Beatles were scheduled to begin their world tour of Denmark, the Netherlands, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Before the start of the tour, Starr was stricken with a high-grade fever, pharyngitis and tonsillitis, and briefly stayed in a local hospital, followed by several days of recuperation at home. He was temporarily replaced for five concerts by 24-year-old session drummer Jimmie Nicol. Starr was discharged from the hospital and rejoined the band in Melbourne on 15 June. He later said that he feared he would be permanently replaced during his illness. In August, the Beatles were introduced to American songwriter Bob Dylan, who offered the group cannabis cigarettes. Starr was the first to try one but the others were hesitant.

On 11 February 1965, Starr married Maureen Cox, whom he had met in 1962. By this time the stress and pressure of Beatlemania had reached a peak for him. He received a telephoned death threat before a show in Montreal, and resorted to positioning his cymbals vertically in an attempt to defend against would-be assassins. The constant pressure affected the Beatles&#x27; performances; Starr commented: &quot;We were turning into such bad musicians ... there was no groove to it.&quot; He was also feeling increasingly isolated from the musical activities of his bandmates, who were moving past the traditional boundaries of rock music into territory that often did not require his accompaniment; during recording sessions he spent hours playing cards with their road manager Neil Aspinall and road manager Mal Evans while the other Beatles perfected tracks without him. In a letter published in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, a fan asked the Beatles to let Starr sing more; he replied: &quot;[I am] quite happy with my one little track on each album&quot;.

==== Studio years ====
In August 1966, the Beatles released &quot;Revolver&quot;, their seventh UK LP. It included the song &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot;, their only British number-one single with Starr as the lead singer. Later that month, owing to the increasing pressures of touring, the Beatles gave their final concert, a 30-minute performance at San Francisco Candlestick Park. Starr commented: &quot;We gave up touring at the right time. Four years of Beatlemania were enough for anyone.&quot; By December he had moved to a larger estate called Sunny Heights, in size, at St George&#x27;s Hill in Weybridge, Surrey, near to Lennon. Although he had equipped the house with many luxury items, including numerous televisions, light machines, film projectors, stereo equipment, a billiard table, go-kart track and a bar named the Flying Cow, he did not include a drum kit; he explained: &quot;When we don&#x27;t record, I don&#x27;t play.&quot;

For the Beatles&#x27; seminal 1967 album, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon–McCartney composition &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;. Although the Beatles had enjoyed widespread commercial and critical success with &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, the long hours they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr&#x27;s increased feeling of alienation within the band; he commented: &quot;[It] wasn&#x27;t our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but for me it was a bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play.&quot; His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his downtime, Starr worked on his guitar playing, and said: &quot;I jump into chords that no one seems to get into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar&quot;.

Epstein&#x27;s death in August 1967 left the Beatles without management; Starr remarked: &quot;[It was] a strange time for us, when it&#x27;s someone who we&#x27;ve relied on in the business, where we never got involved.&quot; Soon afterwards, the band began an ill-fated film project, &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;. Starr&#x27;s growing interest in photography led to his billing as the movie&#x27;s Director of Photography, and his participation in the film&#x27;s editing was matched only by that of McCartney. In February 1968, Starr became the first Beatle to sing on another artist&#x27;s show without the others. He sang the Buck Owens hit &quot;Act Naturally&quot;, and performed a duet with Cilla Black, &quot;Do You Like Me Just a Little Bit?&quot; on her BBC One television programme, &quot;Cilla&quot;.

In November 1968, Apple Records released &quot;The Beatles&quot;, commonly known as the &quot;White Album&quot;. The album was partly inspired by the band&#x27;s recent interactions with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. While attending the Maharishi&#x27;s intermediate course at his ashram in Rishikesh, India, they enjoyed one of their most prolific writing periods, composing most of the album there. It was here that Starr completed his first recorded Beatles song, &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass Me By&quot;, but he left after 10 days and later compared his time there to a stay at Butlin&#x27;s. The long-lasting health problems that began in his childhood had an impact on his time in India, causing him to experience allergies and sensitivities to the local food; when the band travelled there, he resorted to taking his own food with him.

Relations within the Beatles deteriorated during the recording of the White Album, and there were occasions where only one or two members were involved in the recording of a track. Starr had become tired of McCartney&#x27;s increasingly overbearing approach, Lennon&#x27;s passive-aggressive behaviour, and the near-constant presence of Lennon&#x27;s wife Yoko Ono. After one particularly difficult session which included McCartney harshly criticising his drumming, Starr briefly quit the Beatles and went on holiday to Sardinia, where he and his family stayed on a boat loaned to them by actor Peter Sellers. During a lunch there, the chef served octopus and Starr refused to eat it; an ensuing conversation with the ship&#x27;s captain about the animal inspired Starr&#x27;s song &quot;Octopus&#x27;s Garden&quot; from the Beatles&#x27; album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, which he wrote using a guitar during the trip. Two weeks later, he returned to the studio to find that Harrison had covered his drum kit in flowers as a welcome-back gesture.

Despite a temporary return to friendly interactions during the completion of the White Album, production of the Beatles&#x27; fourth feature film &quot;Let It Be&quot; and its accompanying album further strained band relationships. On 20 August 1969, the Beatles gathered for the final time at Abbey Road Studios for a mixing session for &quot;I Want You&quot;. At a business meeting exactly one month later, Lennon told the others that he was leaving the band, effective immediately. However, the band&#x27;s break-up would not become public knowledge until McCartney&#x27;s announcement on 10 April 1970 that he was also leaving.

=== Solo career ===

==== 1970s ====

Shortly before McCartney announced his exit from the Beatles in April 1970, he and Starr had a falling out due to McCartney&#x27;s refusal to cede the release date of his eponymous solo album to allow for Starr&#x27;s debut, &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot;, and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot;. Starr&#x27;s album – composed of renditions of pre-rock standards that included musical arrangements by Quincy Jones, Maurice Gibb, George Martin and McCartney – peaked at number seven in the UK and number 22 in the US. Starr followed &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; with the country-inspired &quot;Beaucoups of Blues&quot;, engineered by Scotty Moore and featuring renowned Nashville session musician Pete Drake. Despite favourable reviews, the album was a commercial failure. Starr subsequently combined his musical activities with developing a career as a film actor.

Starr played drums on Lennon&#x27;s &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; (1970), Ono&#x27;s &quot;Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band&quot; (1970), and on Harrison&#x27;s albums &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; (1970), &quot;Living in the Material World&quot; (1973) and &quot;Dark Horse&quot; (1974). In 1971, Starr participated in the Concert for Bangladesh, organised by Harrison, and with him co-wrote the hit single &quot;It Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot;, which reached number four in both the US and the UK. The following year he released his most successful UK hit, &quot;Back Off Boogaloo&quot; (again produced and co-written by Harrison), which peaked at number two (US number nine). Having become friends with the English singer Marc Bolan, Starr made his directorial debut with the 1972 T. Rex documentary &quot;Born to Boogie&quot;.

In 1973 and 1974, Starr had two number one hits in the US: &quot;Photograph&quot;, a UK number eight hit co-written with Harrison, and &quot;You&#x27;re Sixteen&quot;, written by the Sherman Brothers. Starr&#x27;s third million-selling single in the US, &quot;You&#x27;re Sixteen&quot; was released in the UK in February 1974 where it peaked at number four. Both tracks appeared on Starr&#x27;s debut rock album, &quot;Ringo&quot;, produced by Richard Perry and featuring further contributions from Harrison as well as a song each from Lennon and McCartney. A commercial and critical success, the LP also included &quot;Oh My My&quot;, a US number five. The album reached number seven in the UK and number two in the US. Author Peter Doggett describes &quot;Ringo&quot; as a template for Starr&#x27;s solo career, saying that, as a musician first rather than a songwriter, &quot;he would rely on his friends and his charm, and if both were on tap, then the results were usually appealing&quot;.

&quot;Goodnight Vienna&quot; followed in 1974 and was also successful, reaching number eight in the US and number 30 in the UK. Featuring contributions from Lennon, Elton John and Harry Nilsson, the album included a cover (suggested by Lennon) of the Platters&#x27; 1954 hit &quot;Only You (And You Alone)&quot;, which peaked at number six in the US and number 28 in the UK, and Hoyt Axton&#x27;s &quot;No No Song&quot;, which was a US number three and Starr&#x27;s seventh consecutive top-ten hit. The Elton John-written &quot;Snookeroo&quot; failed to chart in the UK, however. In mid-November 1974, a music video for the song and promotional film for the album was filmed on the rooftop of the Capitol Records Building in Los Angeles, designed to resemble a stack of discs. Lennon provided a voiceover as Starr&#x27;s spacecraft landed on the building and Starr boarded it before taking off over the city. Starr, Nilsson, and Keith Moon were among the cast, along with a forty-foot robot named &#x27;Gort&#x27; placed on the building. During this period Starr became romantically involved with Lynsey de Paul. He played tambourine on a song she wrote and produced for Vera Lynn, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Remember When&quot;, and he inspired another De Paul song, &quot;If I Don&#x27;t Get You the Next One Will&quot;, which she described as being about revenge after he missed a dinner appointment with her because he was asleep in his office.

Starr founded the record label Ring O&#x27; Records in 1975. The company signed eleven artists and released fifteen singles and five albums between 1975 and 1978, including works by David Hentschel, Graham Bonnet and Rab Noakes. The commercial impact of Starr&#x27;s own career diminished over the same period, however, although he continued to record and remained a familiar celebrity presence. Speaking in 2001, he attributed this downward turn to his &quot;[not] taking enough interest&quot; in music, saying of himself and friends such as Nilsson and Keith Moon: &quot;We weren&#x27;t musicians dabbling in drugs and alcohol; now we were junkies dabbling in music.&quot; Starr, Nilsson and Moon were members of a drinking club, the Hollywood Vampires.

From the late 1960s until the mid-1980s, Starr and the designer Robin Cruikshank ran a furniture and interior design company, ROR. ROR&#x27;s designs were placed on sale in the department stores of Harvey Nichols and Liberty of London. The company designed the interiors of palaces in Abu Dhabi and Oman, and the apartments of Paul Raymond and Starr&#x27;s friend Nilsson.

In November 1976, Starr appeared as a guest at the Band&#x27;s farewell concert, featured in the 1978 Martin Scorsese documentary &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;. Also in 1976, Starr issued &quot;Ringo&#x27;s Rotogravure&quot;, the first release under his new contract with Atlantic Records for the North American market and Polydor for all other territories. The album was produced by Arif Mardin and featured compositions by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. Starr promoted the release heavily, yet &quot;Rotogravure&quot; and its accompanying singles failed to chart in the UK. In America, the LP produced two minor hits, &quot;A Dose of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (number 26) and a cover of &quot;Hey! Baby&quot; (number 74), and achieved moderate sales, reaching a chart position of 28. Its disappointing performance inspired Atlantic to revamp Starr&#x27;s formula; the result was a blend of disco and 1970s pop, &quot;Ringo the 4th&quot; (1977). The album failed to chart in the UK and peaked at number 162 in the US. In 1978 Starr released &quot;Bad Boy&quot;, which reached number 129 in the US and again failed to place on the UK albums chart.

In April 1979, Starr became seriously ill with intestinal problems relating to his childhood bout of peritonitis and was taken to the Princess Grace Hospital in Monte Carlo. He almost died and during an operation on 28 April, several feet of intestine had to be removed. Three weeks later he played with McCartney and Harrison at Eric Clapton&#x27;s wedding. On 28 November, a fire destroyed his Hollywood home and much of his Beatles memorabilia.

==== 1980s ====
On 19 May 1980, Starr and Barbara Bach survived a car crash in Surrey, England.

Following Lennon&#x27;s murder in December 1980, Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had originally written for Starr, &quot;All Those Years Ago&quot;, as a tribute to their former bandmate. Released as a Harrison single in 1981, the track, which included Starr&#x27;s drum part and overdubbed backing vocals by McCartney, peaked at number two in the US charts and number 13 in the UK. Later that year, Starr released &quot;Stop and Smell the Roses&quot;, featuring songs produced by Nilsson, McCartney, Harrison, Ronnie Wood and Stephen Stills. The album&#x27;s lead single, the Harrison-composed &quot;Wrack My Brain&quot;, reached number 38 in the US charts, but failed to chart in the UK. Lennon had offered a pair of songs for inclusion on the album – &quot;Nobody Told Me&quot; and &quot;Life Begins at 40&quot; – but following his death, Starr did not feel comfortable recording them. Soon after the murder, Starr and his girlfriend Barbara Bach flew to New York City to be with Lennon&#x27;s widow Yoko Ono.

Following &quot;Stop and Smell the Roses&quot;, Starr&#x27;s recording projects were beset with problems. After completing &quot;Old Wave&quot; in 1982 with producer Joe Walsh, he was unable to find a record company willing to release the album in the UK or the US. In 1987, he abandoned sessions in Memphis for a planned country album, produced by Chips Moman, after which Moman was blocked by a court injunction from issuing the recordings. Starr narrated the 1984–1986 series of the children&#x27;s series &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;, a Britt Allcroft production based on the books by the Reverend W. Awdry. For a single season in 1989, Starr also portrayed the character Mr. Conductor in the American &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; spin-off, &quot;Shining Time Station&quot;.

In 1985, Starr performed with his son Zak as part of Artists United Against Apartheid on the protest song &quot;Sun City&quot;, and, with Harrison and Eric Clapton, was among the special guests on Carl Perkins&#x27; TV special &quot;Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session&quot;. In 1987, he played drums on Harrison&#x27;s Beatles pastiche &quot;When We Was Fab&quot; and also appeared in Godley &amp; Creme&#x27;s innovative video clip for the song. The same year, Starr joined Harrison, Clapton, Jeff Lynne and Elton John in a performance at London&#x27;s Wembley Arena for the Prince&#x27;s Trust charity. In January 1988, he attended the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony in New York, with Harrison and Ono (the latter representing Lennon), to accept the Beatles&#x27; induction into the Hall of Fame.

During October and November 1988, Starr and Bach attended a detox clinic in Tucson, Arizona; each received a six-week treatment for alcoholism. He later commented on his longstanding addiction: &quot;Years I&#x27;ve lost, absolute years ... I&#x27;ve no idea what happened. I lived in a blackout.&quot; Having embraced sobriety, Starr focused on re-establishing his career by making a return to touring. On 23 July 1989, Ringo Starr &amp; His All-Starr Band gave their first performance to an audience of ten thousand in Dallas, Texas. Setting a pattern that would continue over the following decades, the band consisted of Starr and an assortment of musicians who had been successful in their own right at different times. The concerts interchanged Starr&#x27;s singing, including selections of his Beatles and solo songs, with performances of each of the other artists&#x27; well-known material, the latter incorporating either Starr or another musician as drummer.

==== 1990s ====
The first All-Starr excursion led to the release of &quot;Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band&quot; (1990), a compilation of live performances from the 1989 tour. Also in 1990, Starr recorded a version of the song &quot;I Call Your Name&quot; for a television special marking the 10th anniversary of John Lennon&#x27;s death and the 50th anniversary of Lennon&#x27;s birth. The track, produced by Lynne, features a supergroup composed of Lynne, Tom Petty, Joe Walsh and Jim Keltner.

The following year, Starr made a cameo appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Brush with Greatness&quot; and contributed an original song, &quot;You Never Know&quot;, to the soundtrack of the John Hughes film &quot;Curly Sue&quot;. In 1992, he released his first studio album in nine years, &quot;Time Takes Time&quot;, which was produced by Phil Ramone, Don Was, Lynne and Peter Asher and featured guest appearances by various stars including Brian Wilson and Harry Nilsson. The album failed to achieve commercial success, although the single &quot;Weight of the World&quot; peaked at number 74 in the UK, marking his first appearance on the singles chart there since &quot;Only You&quot; in 1974.

In 1994, he began a collaboration with the surviving former Beatles for the &quot;Beatles Anthology&quot; project. They recorded two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon and gave lengthy interviews about the Beatles&#x27; career. Released in December 1995, &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; was the first new Beatles single since 1970. In March 1996, they released a second single, &quot;Real Love&quot;. The temporary reunion ended when Harrison refused to participate in the completion of a third song. Starr then played drums on McCartney&#x27;s 1997 album &quot;Flaming Pie&quot;. Among the tracks to which he contributed, &quot;Little Willow&quot; was a song McCartney wrote about Starr&#x27;s ex-wife Maureen, who died in 1994, while &quot;Really Love You&quot; was the first official release ever credited to McCartney–Starkey.

In 1998, he released two albums on the Mercury label. The studio album &quot;Vertical Man&quot; marked the beginning of a nine-year partnership with Mark Hudson, who produced the album and, with his band the Roundheads, formed the core of the backing group on the recordings. In addition, many famous guests joined on various tracks, including Martin, Petty, McCartney and, in his final appearance on a Starr album, Harrison. Most of the songs were written by Starr and the band. Joe Walsh and the Roundheads joined Starr for his appearance on &quot;VH1 Storytellers&quot;, which was released as an album under the same name. During the show, he performed greatest hits and new songs and told anecdotes relating to them. Starr&#x27;s final release for Mercury was the 1999 Christmas-themed &quot;I Wanna Be Santa Claus&quot;. The album was a commercial failure, although the record company chose not to issue it in Britain.

==== 2000s ====

Starr was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 2002, joining an elite group of drummers and percussionists that include Buddy Rich, William F. Ludwig Sr. and William F. Ludwig Jr. On 29 November 2002 (the first anniversary of Harrison&#x27;s death), he performed &quot;Photograph&quot; and a cover of Carl Perkins&#x27; &quot;Honey Don&#x27;t&quot; at the Concert for George held in the Royal Albert Hall, London. Early the following year, he released the album &quot;Ringo Rama&quot;, which contained a song he co-wrote as a tribute to Harrison, &quot;Never Without You&quot;. Also in 2003, he formed Pumkinhead Records with All-Starr Band member Mark Hudson. The label was not prolific, but their first signing was Liam Lynch, who produced a 2003 LP entitled &quot;Fake Songs&quot;.

Starr served as an honorary Santa Tracker and voice-over personality in 2003 and 2004 during the London stop in Father Christmas&#x27;s annual Christmas Eve journey, as depicted in the annual NORAD tracks Santa program. According to NORAD officials, he was &quot;a Starr in the east&quot; who helped guide North American Aerospace Defense Command&#x27;s Santa-tracking tradition.
His 2005 release &quot;Choose Love&quot; eschewed the star-guests approach of his last two studio albums but failed to chart in the UK or the US. That same year, Liverpool&#x27;s City Council announced plans to demolish Starr&#x27;s birthplace, 9Madryn Street, stating that it had &quot;no historical significance&quot;. The LCC later announced that the building would be taken apart brick by brick and preserved.

Starr released the album &quot;Liverpool 8&quot; in January 2008, coinciding with the start of Liverpool&#x27;s year as the European Capital of Culture. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings, but after a falling out with Starr, he was replaced by David A. Stewart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlewine/Liverpool8&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Starr performed the title track at the opening ceremony for Liverpool&#x27;s appointment, but thereafter attracted controversy over his seemingly unflattering comments about his city of birth. Later that year, he was the object of further criticism in the press for posting a video on his website in which he harangued fans and autograph hunters for sending him items to sign.

In April 2009, he reunited with McCartney at the David Lynch Foundation&#x27;s &quot;Change Begins Within&quot; benefit concert, held at New York&#x27;s Radio City Music Hall. Having played his own set beforehand, Starr joined McCartney for the finale and performed &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot;, among other songs. Starr also appeared on-stage during Microsoft&#x27;s June 2009 E3 press conference with Yoko Ono, McCartney and Olivia Harrison to promote &quot;The Beatles: Rock Band&quot; video game.

==== 2010s ====

In 2010, Starr self-produced and released his fifteenth studio album, &quot;Y Not&quot;, which included the track &quot;Walk with You&quot; and featured a vocal contribution from McCartney. Later that year, he appeared during &quot;Hope for Haiti Now: A Global Benefit for Earthquake Relief&quot; as a celebrity phone operator. On 7 July 2010, he celebrated his 70th birthday at Radio City Music Hall with another All-Starr Band concert, topped with friends and family joining him on stage including Ono, his son Zak, and McCartney.

Starr recorded a cover of Buddy Holly&#x27;s &quot;Think It Over&quot; for the 2011 tribute album &quot;Listen to Me: Buddy Holly&quot;. In January 2012, he released the album &quot;Ringo 2012&quot;. Later that year, he announced that his All-Starr Band would tour the Pacific Rim during 2013 with select dates in New Zealand, Australia and Japan; it was his first performance in Japan since 1996, and his debut in both New Zealand and Australia.

In January 2014, Starr joined McCartney for a special performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, where they performed the song &quot;Queenie Eye&quot;. That summer he toured Canada and the US with an updated version of the Twelfth All-Starr Band, featuring multi-instrumentalist Warren Ham instead of saxophonist Mark Rivera. In July, Starr became involved in &quot;#peacerocks&quot;, an anti-violence campaign started by fashion designer John Varvatos, in conjunction with the David Lynch Foundation.&lt;ref name=&quot;instyle7/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2014, he won at the &quot;GQ&quot; Men of the Year Awards for his humanitarian work with the David Lynch Foundation.

In January 2015, Starr tweeted the title of his new studio album &quot;Postcards from Paradise&quot;. The album came a few weeks in advance of Starr&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and was released on 31 March 2015 to mixed to positive reviews. Later that month, Starr and his band announced a forthcoming Summer 2016 Tour of the US. Full production began in June 2016 in Syracuse.

On 7 July 2017 (his 77th birthday), Starr released &quot;Give More Love&quot; as a single, which was followed two months later by his nineteenth studio album, also titled &quot;Give More Love&quot; and issued by UMe. The album includes appearances by McCartney, as well as frequent collaborators such as Joe Walsh, David A. Stewart, Gary Nicholson and members of the All-Starr Band.

On 13 September 2019, Starr announced the upcoming release of his 20th album, &quot;What&#x27;s My Name&quot;, to be released by UMe on 25 October 2019. He recorded the album in his home studio, Roccabella West in Los Angeles.

==== 2020s ====
In celebration of his 80th birthday in July 2020, Starr organised a live-streamed concert featuring appearances by many of his friends and collaborators including McCartney, Walsh, Ben Harper, Dave Grohl, Sheryl Crow, Sheila E. and Willie Nelson. The show replaced his annual public birthday celebration at the Capitol Records Building, which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On 16 December 2020, Starr released the song &quot;Here&#x27;s to the Nights&quot;. An accompanying video was released on 18 December. The song of peace, love and friendship was written by Diane Warren and features a group of his friends, including McCartney, Joe Walsh, Corinne Bailey Rae, Eric Burdon, Sheryl Crow, Finneas, Dave Grohl, Ben Harper, Lenny Kravitz, Jenny Lewis, Steve Lukather, Chris Stapleton and Yola. The song was the lead single from his EP &quot;Zoom In&quot;, which was released on 19 March 2021 via UMe.

On 16 March 2021, Starr stated in an interview with &quot;Esquire&quot; that it was unlikely that he would record another full-length album, preferring to release EPs instead. On 24 September that year, he released the EP &quot;Change the World&quot;, a sequel to the previous EP &quot;Zoom In&quot;.

On 7 February 2022, Starr announced his intention to return to touring with his band for the first time since 2019. The tour was announced to run from 27 May to 26 June, though several concerts held in June would end up being postponed till October due to two members of the band catching COVID-19. These postponed events were added to the band&#x27;s previously announced fall tour to be held in September and October. On 1 October, he cancelled a concert at the Four Winds New Buffalo casino due to an unspecified illness affecting his voice. Another concert to be held at Mystic Lake Casino Hotel the following day was also postponed. On 3 October, it was confirmed that Starr had tested positive for COVID-19, after which several shows in Canada were cancelled.

On 16 September 2022, Starr released the EP &quot;EP3&quot;. On 12 January 2023, Starr announced that he and the All-Starr Band would be touring in the US that spring, from 19 May to 17 June. In May 2023, a series of tour dates in the fall were also announced, from 17 September to 13 October. Another EP by Starr, &quot;Rewind Forward&quot;, released on 13 October. Another, &quot;Crooked Boy&quot;, was initially released as a Record Store Day exclusive in 2024, with digital and physical releases on 26 April and 31 May, respectively. A country and roots album, &quot;Look Up&quot;, produced by T Bone Burnett, was released on 10 January 2025.

==Artistry==
===Influences===
During his youth, Starr had been a devoted fan of skiffle and blues music, but by the time he joined the Texans in 1958, he had developed a preference for rock and roll. He was also influenced by country artists, including Hank Williams, Buck Owens and Hank Snow, and jazz artists such as Chico Hamilton and Yusef Lateef, whose compositional style inspired Starr&#x27;s fluid and energetic drum fills and grooves. While reflecting on Buddy Rich, Starr commented: &quot;He does things with one hand that I can&#x27;t do with nine, but that&#x27;s technique. Everyone I talk to says &#x27;What about Buddy Rich?&#x27; Well, what about him? Because he doesn&#x27;t turn me on.&quot; He stated that he &quot;was never really into drummers&quot;, but identified Cozy Cole 1958 cover of Benny Goodman &quot;Topsy Part Two&quot; as &quot;the one drum record&quot; he bought.

Starr&#x27;s first musical hero was Gene Autry, about whom he commented: &quot;I remember getting shivers up my back when he sang, &#x27;South of the Border. By the early 1960s he had become an ardent fan of Lee Dorsey. In November 1964, Starr told &quot;Melody Maker&quot;: &quot;Our music is second-hand versions of negro music ... Ninety per cent of the music I like is coloured.&quot;

===Drums===

Starr said of his drumming: &quot;I&#x27;m no good on the technical things ... I&#x27;m your basic offbeat drummer with funny fills ... because I&#x27;m really left-handed playing a right-handed kit. I can&#x27;t roll around the drums because of that.&quot; Beatles producer George Martin said: &quot;Ringo hit good and hard and used the tom-tom well, even though he couldn&#x27;t do a roll to save his life&quot;, but later said, &quot;He&#x27;s got tremendous feel. He always helped us to hit the right tempo for a song, and gave it that support – that rock-solid back-beat – that made the recording of all the Beatles&#x27; songs that much easier.&quot; Starr said he did not believe the drummer&#x27;s role was to &quot;interpret the song&quot;. Instead, comparing his drumming to painting, he said: &quot;I am the foundation, and then I put a bit of glow here and there ... If there&#x27;s a gap, I want to be good enough to fill it.&quot;

In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers voted Starr the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. Journalist Robyn Flans wrote for the Percussive Arts Society: &quot;I cannot count the number of drummers who have told me that Ringo inspired their passion for drums&quot;. Drummer Steve Smith said:

Starr said his favourite drummer is Jim Keltner, with whom he first played at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. The pair subsequently played drums together on some of Harrison&#x27;s recordings during the 1970s, on &quot;Ringo&quot; and other albums by Starr, and on the early All-Starr Band tours. For &quot;Ringo&#x27;s Rotogravure&quot; in 1976, Starr credited himself as &quot;Thunder&quot; and Keltner as &quot;Lightnin.

Starr is widely known for sitting behind the drum kit in a higher position than most drummers. This position gives him better access to the tom-tom and cymbals as well as doing the rimshot.

Starr influenced the Genesis drummer Phil Collins, who said: &quot;I think he&#x27;s vastly underrated, Ringo. The drum fills on &#x27;A Day in the Life&#x27; are very, very complex things. You could take a great drummer from today and say, &#x27;I want it like that&#x27;, and they really wouldn&#x27;t know what to do.&quot; Collins said his drumming on the 1983 Genesis song &quot;That&#x27;s All&quot; was an affectionate attempt at a &quot;Ringo Starr drum part&quot;.

In an often-repeated but apocryphal story, when asked if Starr was the best drummer in the world, Lennon quipped that he &quot;wasn&#x27;t even the best drummer in the Beatles&quot;. The line actually comes from a 1981 episode of the BBC Radio 4 comedy series &quot;Radio Active&quot;, and gained more prominence when it was used by the television comedian Jasper Carrott in 1983, three years after Lennon&#x27;s death. In September 1980, Lennon told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that Starr was a &quot;damn good drummer&quot; whose talent would have surfaced even without the Beatles.

Tjinder Singh of the indie rock band Cornershop said Starr was a pioneering drummer: &quot;There was a time when the common consensus was that Ringo couldn&#x27;t play. What&#x27;s that all about? He&#x27;s totally unique, a one-off, and hip hop has a lot to thank him for.&quot; In his book &quot;The Complete Beatles Recording Sessions&quot;, Mark Lewisohn says there were fewer than a dozen occasions in the Beatles&#x27; eight-year recording career where session breakdowns were caused by Starr making a mistake, while the vast majority of takes were stopped due to mistakes by the other Beatles. Starr influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings. According to Ken Micallef and Donnie Marshall, co-authors of &quot;Classic Rock Drummers&quot;: &quot;Ringo&#x27;s fat tom sounds and delicate cymbal work were imitated by thousands of drummers.&quot;

In 2021, Starr announced a ten-part MasterClass course called &quot;Drumming and Creative Collaboration&quot;.

===Vocals===
Starr sang lead vocals for a song on most of the Beatles&#x27; studio albums as part of an attempt to establish a vocal personality for each band member. In many cases, Lennon or McCartney wrote the lyrics and melody especially for him, as they did for &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; from &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. These melodies were tailored to Starr&#x27;s limited baritone vocal range. Because of his distinctive voice, Starr rarely performed backing vocals during his time with the Beatles, but they can be heard on songs such as &quot;Maxwell&#x27;s Silver Hammer&quot; and &quot;Carry That Weight&quot;. He is also the lead vocalist on his compositions &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass Me By&quot; and &quot;Octopus&#x27;s Garden&quot;. In addition, he sang lead on &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;, &quot;Boys&quot;, &quot;Matchbox&quot;, &quot;Honey Don&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;Act Naturally&quot;, &quot;Good Night&quot; and &quot;What Goes On&quot;.

===Songwriting===
Starr&#x27;s idiosyncratic turns of phrase or &quot;Ringoisms&quot;, such as &quot;a hard day&#x27;s night&quot; and &quot;tomorrow never knows&quot;, were used as song titles by the Beatles, particularly by Lennon. McCartney commented: &quot;Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic.&quot; Starr also occasionally contributed lyrics to unfinished Lennon–McCartney songs, such as the line &quot;darning his socks in the night when there&#x27;s nobody there&quot; in &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;.

Starr is credited as the sole composer of two Beatles songs: &quot;Don&#x27;t Pass Me By&quot; and &quot;Octopus&#x27;s Garden&quot;, the latter written with assistance from Harrison. While promoting the &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album in 1969, Harrison recognised Starr&#x27;s lyrics to &quot;Octopus&#x27;s Garden&quot; as an unwittingly profound message about finding inner peace, and therefore an example of how &quot;Ringo writes his cosmic songs without knowing it.&quot; Starr is also credited as a co-writer of &quot;What Goes On&quot;, &quot;Flying&quot; and &quot;Dig It&quot;. On material issued after the band&#x27;s break-up, he received a writing credit for &quot;Taking a Trip to Carolina&quot; and joint songwriting credits with the other Beatles for &quot;12-Bar Original&quot;, &quot;Los Paranoias&quot;, &quot;Christmas Time (Is Here Again)&quot;, &quot;Suzy Parker&quot; (from the &quot;Let It Be&quot; film), &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Dream&quot; (from the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; film), &quot;Free as a Bird&quot; and &quot;Now and Then&quot;.

In a 2003 interview, Starr discussed Harrison&#x27;s input in his songwriting and said: &quot;I was great at writing two verses and a chorus – I&#x27;m still pretty good at that. Finishing songs is not my forte.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ruttenburg/TimeOutNY&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison helped Starr complete two of his biggest hit songs, &quot;It Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot; and &quot;Back Off Boogaloo&quot;, although he only accepted a credit for &quot;Photograph&quot;, which they wrote together in France. Starting with the &quot;Ringo&quot; album in 1973, Starr shared a songwriting partnership with Vini Poncia. One of the pair&#x27;s first collaborations was &quot;Oh My My&quot;. Over half of the songs on &quot;Ringo the 4th&quot; were Starkey–Poncia compositions, but the partnership produced just two more songs, released on &quot;Bad Boy&quot; in 1978.

==Personal life==
Starr met hairdresser Maureen Cox in 1962, the same week that he joined the Beatles. They married at Caxton Hall on 11 February 1965. Starr&#x27;s stepfather Harry Graves and fellow Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon were all witnesses, while Beatles manager Brian Epstein served as best man. Their marriage became the subject of the novelty song &quot;Treat Him Tender, Maureen&quot; by the Chicklettes. The couple had three children: Zak (b. 13 September 1965), Jason (b. 19 August 1967) and Lee (b. 11 November 1970). In 1971, Starr purchased Lennon&#x27;s home Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire and moved his family there. The couple divorced in 1975 following Starr&#x27;s repeated infidelities, alcoholism, and volatile behavior. Cox died from leukaemia at the age of 48 in December 1994.

In 1985, he was the first of the Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of Zak&#x27;s daughter Tatia Jayne Starkey. Zak is also a drummer, and he spent time with the Who&#x27;s Keith Moon during his father&#x27;s regular absences; he has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours. Starr has eight grandchildren: two from Zak, three from Jason, and three from Lee. In 2016, he was the first Beatle to become a great-grandfather.
Starr met actress Barbara Bach in 1980 on the set of the film &quot;Caveman&quot;, and they were married at Marylebone Town Hall on 27 April 1981. Starr and Bach split their time between homes in Cranleigh in Surrey, Los Angeles, and Monte Carlo. He was listed at number 56 in the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List 2011&quot; with an estimated personal wealth of £150 million. In 2012, he was estimated to be the wealthiest drummer in the world. In 2014, Starr announced that his Surrey estate at Rydinghurst at Cranleigh was for sale, with its Grade II-listed Jacobean house. However, he retains a property in the London district of Chelsea off King&#x27;s Road, and he and Bach continue to divide their time between London and Los Angeles.

In December 2015, Starr and Bach auctioned some of their personal and professional items via Julien&#x27;s Auctions in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Julien/Property&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The collection included Starr&#x27;s first Ludwig Black Oyster Pearl drum kit, instruments given to him by Harrison, Lennon, and Marc Bolan, and a first-pressing copy of the Beatles&#x27; White Album numbered &quot;0000001&quot;. The auction raised over $9 million, a portion of which was set aside for the Lotus Foundation, a charity founded by Starr and Bach.

In 2016, Starr expressed his support for the United Kingdom&#x27;s withdrawal from the European Union. &quot;I thought the European Union was a great idea,&quot; he said, &quot;but I didn&#x27;t see it going anywhere lately.&quot; In 2017, he described his impatience for Britain to &quot;get on with&quot; Brexit, declaring that &quot;to be in control of your country is a good move&quot;.

In October 2021, Starr was named in the Pandora Papers, which alleged secret financial deals among politicians and celebrities using tax havens in an effort to avoid the payment of owed taxes.

Starr is a vegetarian. Mary McCartney confirmed he is allergic to garlic and onions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maclean/Independent&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He meditates daily, and his catchphrase and motto for life is &quot;peace and love&quot;.

==Awards and honours==
Starr and the other members of the Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1965 Birthday Honours; they received their insignia from Queen Elizabeth II at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October. He and the other Beatles were collectively nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer for their performances in the 1964 film &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. In 1971, the Beatles received an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film &quot;Let It Be&quot;. The minor planet 4150 Starr, discovered on 31 August 1984 by Brian A. Skiff at the Anderson Mesa Station of the Lowell Observatory, was named in Starr&#x27;s honour. Starr was nominated for a 1989 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a Children&#x27;s Series for his role as Mr. Conductor in the television series &quot;Shining Time Station&quot;.

In 2015, 27 years after he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the Beatles, Starr became the last Beatle to be inducted for a solo career. Unlike the other three Beatles who were inducted within the &quot;Performers&quot; category, Starr was inducted within the &quot;Musical Excellence&quot; category. During the 50th Grammy Awards, Starr, George Martin and his son Giles accepted the Best Compilation Soundtrack award for &quot;Love&quot;. On 9 November 2008, Starr accepted a Diamond Award on behalf of the Beatles during the 2008 World Music Awards ceremony in Monaco. On 8 February 2010, he was honoured with the 2,401st star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. It is located at 1750 North Vine Street, in front of the Capitol Records building, as are the stars for Lennon, McCartney and Harrison.

Starr was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music. He was knighted in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace by Prince William, Duke of Cambridge on 20 March 2018.

In 2022, Starr received an honorary Doctor of Music degree from the Berklee College of Music for his &quot;immeasurable impact on music, film and television, and popular culture&quot;.

==Film career==

Starr has received praise from critics and movie industry professionals regarding his acting; director and producer Walter Shenson called him &quot;a superb actor, an absolute natural&quot;. By the mid-1960s, Starr had become a connoisseur of film. In addition to his roles in &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; (1964), &quot;Help!&quot; (1965), &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; (1967) and &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970), Starr also acted in &quot;Candy&quot; (1968), &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; (1969), &quot;Blindman&quot; (1971), &quot;Son of Dracula&quot; (1974) and &quot;Caveman&quot; (1981). In 1971, he starred as Larry the Dwarf in Frank Zappa&#x27;s &quot;200 Motels&quot; and was featured in Harry Nilsson&#x27;s animated film &quot;The Point!&quot; He co-starred in &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; (1973) as a Teddy Boy and appeared in &quot;The Last Waltz&quot;, the Martin Scorsese documentary film about the 1976 farewell concert of the Band.

Starr played the Pope in Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;Lisztomania&quot; (1975), and a fictionalised version of himself in McCartney&#x27;s &quot;Give My Regards to Broad Street&quot; in 1984. Starr appeared as himself and a downtrodden alter-ego Ognir Rrats in &quot;Ringo&quot; (1978), an American-made television comedy film based loosely on &quot;The Prince and the Pauper&quot;. For the 1979 documentary film on the Who, &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot;, Starr appeared in interview segments with fellow drummer Keith Moon.

<text>rn (short for &quot;Read News&quot;) is a Usenet newsreader written by Larry Wall and originally released in 1984. It was one of the first newsreaders to take full advantage of a character-addressable CRT terminal (codice_1 by Kenneth Almquist was first). Previous newsreaders, such as &quot;readnews&quot;, were mostly line-oriented and designed for use on the printing terminals which were common on the early Unix minicomputers where the Usenet software and network originated. Later variants of the original &quot;rn&quot; program included &quot;rrn&quot;, &quot;trn&quot;, and &quot;strn&quot;.

==Features==
&quot;rn&quot; was also notable for three other features it introduced: Kill file, &quot;do the right thing&quot;, and automatic configuration. 

A Kill file is a file (called, obviously enough, ) containing regular expressions matched against the subjects of news articles in each group. If an article matches, it is marked as having already been read. This feature was essential as the growth of the Usenet made it impossible to read every article in even a limited selection of newsgroups.

&quot;Do the right thing&quot; introduced a fundamental change in user-interface from previous news software. Rather than require a user to navigate menus or learn a command vocabulary for each mode of the program, certain single-keystroke commands were used throughout the user interface to perform the most appropriate function based on context. For example, the space character will &quot;go on to the next thing&quot;, and the &quot;next thing&quot; could be the next page, the next article, or the next newsgroup, depending on where the user is in the process of reading news.

Finally, automatic configuration is a feature for system administrators not visible to users that allows for building and installing the application with relative ease. Most Unix programs, and in particular Usenet software, were (and still often are) distributed in source code form which requires building and installing before users can use it. Because different versions of Unix were organized differently, a system administrator required sufficient programming skill to modify the source code to account for these differences. &quot;rn&quot; changed that paradigm by including a script, called &quot;Configure&quot;, with enough intelligence to customize the build and install process for the system it was running on. Since its introduction in the &quot;rn&quot; codebase, the pattern of including a similar configure script in any software distribution became and still is popular.

==History==
Like all of the original newsreaders and the Usenet software itself, &quot;rn&quot; was designed for the environment of a large time-shared minicomputer, which users connected to using terminals wired directly to the machine, and where the only networks available were accessed by slow and expensive dial-up modem connections. All of the articles in all of the newsgroups were stored in files on the local disk (known as the &quot;news spool&quot;), and &quot;rn&quot; could simply read those files directly when presenting them to the user. When local area networks became widespread, it was natural that administrators and users would desire remote access to the news spool, and NNTP, the Network News Transfer Protocol, was developed to serve that need. While working at Baylor College of Medicine, Stan O. Barber developed &quot;remote rn&quot; (rrn), a set of patches to &quot;rn&quot; which allowed it to communicate with an NNTP server over a local-area (or even wide-area) network. Barber later took over maintenance responsibility for &quot;rn&quot; itself from Larry Wall.

As news volumes continued to increase, it became apparent that even KILL files could not possibly keep up with the sheer number of users and articles. A new concept, the &quot;threaded&quot; newsreader, was needed as users gradually switched from a &quot;read most, kill few&quot; model to &quot;ignore most, read few&quot;. By organizing the articles in a newsgroup according to threads of discussion, using headers that had long been present in Usenet articles but practically unused, a threaded newsreader would allow users to keep up with topics and discussions they were interested without having to explicitly deselect uninteresting threads. Kim F. Storm&#x27;s &quot;nn&quot; newsreader was the first to implement this new model, and it looked for a while as if &quot;nn&quot; would do to &quot;rn&quot; what &quot;rn&quot; did to &quot;readnews&quot;. This fate was averted when Wayne Davison developed trn, a set of patches to &quot;rn&quot; which gave it both threading at the article level and a new user interface that would allow users to select only the threads they desired, while remaining true to the original &quot;rn&quot; interface philosophy of &quot;do the right thing&quot;.

An even more recent addition to the &quot;rn&quot; family has been the addition of &quot;scoring&quot;, which allows a more complex method of evaluating articles to determine whether the user wishes to read them; originally this was implemented in a code fork of &quot;trn&quot; called &quot;strn&quot;, but later this was integrated into the official &quot;trn&quot; distribution.

<text>Carl Rolf Ekéus (born 7 July 1935) is a Swedish diplomat. From 1978 to 1983, he was a representative to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva, and he has worked on various other disarmament committees and commissions.

Between 1991 and 1997 he was director of the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq, the United Nations disarmament observers in Iraq after the Gulf War. In late July 2002 he reportedly said in the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper that during his time in this position he attempted to resist attempts by the United States to use the commission to perform espionage. His successor as director was Richard Butler.

The journalist Andrew Cockburn reported in &quot;The First Post&quot; that Ekéus told him how the former US President Bill Clinton attempted to prevent Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq from being certified as free of weapons of mass destruction. Despite Ekéus&#x27; belief that Iraq was nearly certifiable as being free of such weapons, US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced that United Nations sanctions would not be lifted until such time as Hussein was no longer in power.

Ekéus later became Sweden&#x27;s ambassador to the United States and the chairman of the board of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

According to the journalist Christopher Hitchens, Ekéus &quot;told me that he&#x27;d been offered by Tariq Aziz in person, to his face, a bribe of a million and a half dollars to change his inspection report. That was going on throughout the entire process. Rolf wouldn&#x27;t, of course, agree to take it, but if they were asking him, it means they were asking everybody.&quot; The story has also been covered by The Telegraph.

In January 2000, Ekéus was nominated to head the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspections Commission (UNMOVIC), charged with investigating allegations that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. But Ekéus&#x27; name failed to receive the approval of the UN Security Council, due to the opposition of France, Russia and China, and so Hans Blix was appointed instead.

Ekéus was High Commissioner on National Minorities at the OSCE from 2001 till 2007, as well as on the board of directors for the Nuclear Threat Initiative (NTI). Since 2005, Ekéus has been a Commissioner of the International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP). He is also Member of the Supervisory Council of the International Luxembourg Forum on Preventing Nuclear Catastrophe, a not-for-profit organisation uniting leading experts on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, materials and delivery vehicles.

<text>Sir Robert Gordon Menzies (20 December 1894 – 15 May 1978) was an Australian politician and lawyer who served as the 12th prime minister of Australia from 1939 to 1941 and from 1949 to 1966. He held office as the leader of the United Australia Party (UAP) in his first term, and subsequently as the inaugural leader of the Liberal Party of Australia in his second. He was the member of parliament (MP) for the Victorian division of Kooyong from 1934 to 1966. He is the longest-serving prime minister in Australian history.

Menzies studied law at the University of Melbourne and became one of Melbourne&#x27;s leading lawyers. He was Deputy Premier of Victoria from 1932 to 1934, and then transferred to Federal Parliament, subsequently becoming Attorney-General of Australia and Minister for Industry in the government of Joseph Lyons. In April 1939, following Lyons&#x27;s death, Menzies was elected leader of the United Australia Party (UAP) and sworn in as prime minister. He authorised Australia&#x27;s entry into World War II in September 1939, and spent four months in England to participate in meetings of Churchill&#x27;s war cabinet. On his return to Australia in August 1941, Menzies found that he had lost the support of his party and consequently resigned as prime minister. He subsequently helped to create the new Liberal Party, and was elected its inaugural leader in August 1945.

At the 1949 federal election, Menzies led the Liberal–Country coalition to victory and returned as prime minister. His appeal to the home and family, promoted via reassuring radio talks, matched the national zeitgeist as the economy grew and middle-class values prevailed; the Australian Labor Party&#x27;s support had also been eroded by Cold War scares. After 1955, his government also received support from the Democratic Labor Party, a breakaway group from the Labor Party. Menzies won seven consecutive elections during his second period, eventually retiring as prime minister in January 1966. Despite the failures of his first administration, his government is remembered for its development of Australia&#x27;s capital city of Canberra, its expanded post-war immigration scheme, emphasis on higher education, and national security policies, which saw Australia contribute troops to the Korean War, the Malayan Emergency, the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, and the Vietnam War.

==Early life==
===Birth and family background===
Robert Gordon Menzies was born on 20 December 1894 at his parents&#x27; home in Jeparit, Victoria. He was the fourth of five children born to Kate (&quot;née&quot; Sampson) and James Menzies; he had two elder brothers, an elder sister Isabel, and a younger brother. Menzies was the first Australian prime minister to have two Australian-born parents: his father was born in Ballarat and his mother in Creswick. His grandparents on both sides had been drawn to Australia by the Victorian gold rush. His maternal grandparents were born in Penzance, Cornwall. His paternal grandfather, also named Robert Menzies, was born in Renfrewshire, Scotland, and arrived in Melbourne in 1854. The following year he married Elizabeth Band, the daughter of a cobbler from Fife. Menzies was proud of his Scottish heritage, and preferred his surname to be pronounced in the traditional Scottish manner ( ) rather than as it is spelled ( ). This gave rise to his nickname &quot;Ming&quot;, which was later expanded to &quot;Ming the Merciless&quot; after the comic strip character. His middle name was given in honour of Charles George Gordon.

The Menzies family had moved to Jeparit, a small Wimmera township, in the year before Robert&#x27;s birth. At the 1891 census, the settlement had a population of just 55 people. His elder siblings had been born in Ballarat, where his father was a locomotive painter at the Phoenix Foundry. Seeking a new start, he moved the family to Jeparit to take over the general store, which &quot;survived rather than prospered&quot;. During Menzies&#x27;s childhood, three of his close relatives were elected to parliament. His uncle Hugh was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1902, followed by his father in 1911, while another uncle, Sydney Sampson, was elected to the federal Australian House of Representatives in 1906. Each of the three represented rural constituencies, and were defeated after a few terms. Menzies&#x27;s maternal grandfather John Sampson was active in the trade union movement. He was the inaugural president of the Creswick Miners&#x27; Association, which he co-founded with future Australian Labor Party MP William Spence, and was later prominent in the Amalgamated Miners&#x27; Association.

===Childhood===
Growing up, Menzies and his siblings &quot;had the normal enjoyments and camaraderies of a small country town&quot;. He began his formal education in 1899 at the Jeparit State School, a single-teacher one-room school. When he was about eleven, he and his sister were sent to Ballarat to live with his paternal grandmother; his two older brothers were already living there. In 1906, Menzies began attending the Humffray Street State School in Bakery Hill. The following year, aged 13, he ranked first in the state-wide scholarship examinations. This feat financed the entirety of his secondary education, which had to be undertaken at private schools, as Victoria did not yet have a system of public secondary schools. In 1908 and 1909, Menzies attended Grenville College, a small private school in Ballarat Central. He and his family moved to Melbourne in 1910, where he enrolled in Wesley College. Menzies was &quot;not very interested in and certainly incompetent at sport&quot;, but excelled academically. In his third and final year at Wesley he won a £40 exhibition for university study, one of 25 awarded by the state government.

===University===
In 1913, Menzies entered the Melbourne Law School. He won a variety of prizes, exhibitions, and scholarships during his time as a student, graduating as a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) in 1916 and a Master of Laws (LL.M.) in 1918. He did, however, fail Latin in his first year. One of his prize-winning essays, &quot;The Rule of Law During the War&quot;, was published as a brochure with an introduction by Harrison Moore, the law school dean. In 1916, Menzies was elected president of the Student Representatives&#x27; Council and editor of the &quot;Melbourne University Magazine&quot;. He wrote both prose and poetry for the magazine, and also contributed a song about &quot;little Billy Hughes&quot; to an end-of-year revue. Menzies was also president of the Students&#x27; Christian Union, a founding member of the Historical Society, and a prominent member of the Law Students&#x27; Society. He had &quot;a reputation as an &quot;unusually bright and articulate member of the undergraduate community&quot;, and was known as a skilful debater. However, he had also begun to develop the traits of pomposity and arrogance that would cause difficulties later in his career. His fellow law student and future parliamentary colleague Percy Joske noted Menzies as a student &quot;did not suffer fools gladly [...] the trouble was that his opponents frequently were not fools and that he tended to say things that were not only cutting and unkind but that were unjustified&quot;.

During World War I, Menzies served his compulsory militia service in the Melbourne University Rifles (a part-time militia unit) from 1915 to 1919. This unit was not efficient and Menzies noted in his diary that training in even basic skills such as rifle shooting was sub-standard. He was commissioned a second lieutenant on 6 January 1915. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he did not volunteer for overseas service, something that would later be used against him by political opponents; in 1939 he described it as &quot;a stream of mud through which I have waded at every campaign in which I have participated&quot;. Menzies never publicly addressed the reasons for his decision not to enlist, stating only that they were &quot;compelling&quot; and related to his &quot;intimate personal and family affairs&quot;. His two older brothers did serve overseas. In a 1972 interview, his brother Frank Menzies recalled that a &quot;family conference&quot; had determined that Robert should not enlist. They believed that having two of the family&#x27;s three adult sons serving overseas was a sufficiently patriotic contribution to the war effort, and that the family&#x27;s interests would be served best by Robert continuing his academic career. Another reason for keeping one of the elder sons home was the health of their father, James, who was physically unwell and emotionally unstable at the time. It has been noted that, as a student, Menzies supported the introduction of compulsory overseas conscription, which if implemented would have made him one of the first to be conscripted. Promoted to lieutenant, he resigned his commission with effect from 16 February 1921.

=== Legal career ===
After graduating from the University of Melbourne in 1916 with first-class honours in Law, Menzies was admitted to the Victorian Bar and to the High Court of Australia in 1918. Establishing his own practice in Melbourne, Menzies specialised chiefly in constitutional law which he had read with the leading Victorian jurist and future High Court judge, Sir Owen Dixon. In 1920, Menzies was an advocate for the Amalgamated Society of Engineers which eventually took its appeal to the High Court of Australia. The case became a landmark authority for the positive reinterpretation of Commonwealth powers over those of the States. The High Court&#x27;s verdict raised Menzies&#x27;s profile as a skilled advocate, and eventually he was appointed a King&#x27;s Counsel in 1929.

==Early career in politics==
=== State politics ===
In 1928, Menzies entered state parliament as a member of the Victorian Legislative Council from East Yarra Province, representing the Nationalist Party of Australia. He stood for constitutional democracy, the rule of law, the sanctity of contracts and the jealous preservation of existing institutions. Suspicious of the Labor Party, Menzies stressed the superiority of free enterprise except for certain public utilities such as the railways. His candidacy was nearly defeated when a group of ex-servicemen attacked him in the press for not having enlisted. Within weeks of his entry to parliament, he was made a minister without portfolio in a new minority Nationalist State government led by Premier William McPherson. The new government had formed when the previous Labor government lost the support of the cross-bench Country Progressives. The following year he shifted to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the member for the Electoral district of Nunawading. In 1929, he founded the Young Nationalists as his party&#x27;s youth wing and was its first president. Holding the portfolios of Attorney-General and Minister for the Railways, Menzies was Deputy Premier of Victoria from May 1932 until July 1934.

=== Federal politics ===
In August 1934, Menzies resigned from state parliament to contest the federal Division of Kooyong in the upcoming general election for the United Australia Party (UAP), which was the result of a merger during his tenure as a state parliamentarian of the Nationalists, Labor dissidents and the Australian Party.

The previous member, John Latham, had given up the seat in order to prepare for appointment as Chief Justice of Australia. Kooyong was a safely conservative seat based on Kew, and Menzies won easily. He was immediately appointed Attorney-General of Australia and Minister for Industry in the Lyons government. In 1937 he was appointed a Privy Counsellor. In late 1934 and early 1935 Menzies, then attorney-general, unsuccessfully prosecuted the government&#x27;s highly controversial case for the attempted exclusion from Australia of Egon Kisch, a Czech Jewish communist. The initial prohibition on Kisch&#x27;s entry to Australia, however, had not been imposed by Menzies but by the Country Party minister for the interior, Thomas Paterson.

Menzies had extended discussions with British experts on Germany in 1935, but could not make up his mind whether Adolf Hitler was a &quot;real German patriot&quot; or a &quot;mad swash-buckler&quot;. He condemned Nazi antisemitism, in 1933 writing to the organisers of an anti-Nazi protest at the Melbourne Town Hall that &quot;I hope that I may be associated with the protest of the meeting tonight against the barbaric and medieval persecution to which their fellow Jews in Europe are apparently being subjected&quot;. In July 1939, Menzies, by then prime minister, declared in a speech that &quot;history will label Hitler as one of the great men of the century&quot;.

In August 1938, while Attorney-General, Menzies spent several weeks on an official visit to Nazi Germany. He was strongly committed to democracy for the British peoples, but he initially thought that the Germans should take care of their own affairs. He strongly supported the appeasement policies of the Chamberlain government in London, and sincerely believed that war could and should be avoided at all costs. after the visit to Germany in 1938, Menzies wrote that the &quot;abandonment by the Germans of individual liberty ... has something rather magnificent about it&quot;. Menzies also praised the &quot;really spiritual quality in the willingness of Germans to devote themselves to the service and well-being of the state&quot;.

Menzies supported British foreign policy, including appeasement, and was initially reticent about the prospect of going to war with Germany. However, by September 1939 the unfolding crisis in Europe changed his public stance that the diplomatic efforts by Chamberlain and other leaders to broker a peace agreement had failed, and that war was now an inevitability. In his Declaration of War broadcast on 3 September 1939, Menzies explained the dramatic turn of events over the past twelve months necessitating this change of course: 

In those past 12 months, what has happened? in cold-blooded breach of the solemn obligations implied in both the statements I have quoted, Hitler has annexed the whole of the Czechoslovak state. Has, without flickering an eyelid, made a pact with Russia, a country the denouncing and reviling of which has been his chief stock-in-trade ever since he became chancellor. And has now, under circumstances which I will describe to you, invaded with armed force and in defiance of civilised opinion, the independent nation of Poland. Your own comments on this dreadful history will need no reinforcement by me. All I need say is, that whatever the inflamed ambitions of the German Führer may be, he will undoubtedly learn, as other great enemies of freedom have learned before, that no empire, no dominion, can be soundly established upon a basis of broken promises or dishonoured agreements. 

Menzies went on to say that if Hitler&#x27;s expansionist &quot;policy were allowed to go unchecked there could be no security in Europe and there could be no just peace for the world&quot;. However, in a letter written by Menzies on 11 September 1939, he privately urged for peace negotiations and the continuation of appeasement with Hitler.

Meanwhile, on the domestic front, animosity developed between Sir Earle Page and Menzies which was aggravated when Page became Acting Prime Minister during Lyons&#x27;s illness after October 1938. Menzies and Page attacked each other publicly. He later became deputy leader of the UAP. His supporters began promoting him as Lyons&#x27;s natural successor; his critics accused Menzies of wanting to push Lyons out, a charge he denied.

In 1938, as part of the Dalfram dispute, he was ridiculed as &quot;Pig Iron Bob&quot;, the result of an industrial conflict with the Waterside Workers&#x27; Federation of Australia whose members had refused to load Australian pig iron being sold to an arms manufacturer in the Empire of Japan, for that country&#x27;s war against China. In 1939, he resigned from the Cabinet in protest at postponement of the national insurance scheme and insufficient expenditure on defence.

== First prime ministership ==

With Lyons&#x27;s sudden death on 7 April 1939, Page became caretaker prime minister until the UAP could elect a new leader. On 18 April 1939, Menzies was elected party leader over three other candidates. He was sworn in as prime minister eight days later.

A crisis arose almost immediately, however, when Page refused to serve under him. In an extraordinary personal attack in the House, Page accused Menzies of cowardice for not having enlisted in the War, and of treachery to Lyons. Menzies then formed a minority government. When Page was deposed as Country Party leader a few months later, Menzies took the Country Party back into his government in a full-fledged Coalition, with Page&#x27;s successor, Archie Cameron, as number-two-man in the government. 

===Lead-up to World War II===
During the Danzig crisis, Menzies, who had long felt that the Treaty of Versailles was too harsh towards Germany, supported having the Free City of Danzig (modern Gdańsk) rejoin Germany. Though Hitler had only asked for extraterritorial highways across the Polish Corridor to link East Prussia with the rest of the &quot;Reich&quot;, Menzies also supported having the Polish Corridor returned to Germany. Despite his support for the Germans&#x27; claims to Danzig, Menzies was opposed to the prospect of German domination of Europe. Menzies in a speech on 28 March 1939 declared: &quot;I do not accept this doctrine of an unimpeded march by Germany to a territorial conquest of middle and southeastern Europe&quot;. Ultimately, the fear of Japan proved decisive for Menzies, who believed that for Australia to not support Britain in the Danzig crisis would lead to Britain eventually abandoning Australia to face Japan alone. The prospect of war in Europe threatened to undermine the Singapore strategy that called for the main British battle fleet to be sent out to Singapore (the major British naval base in Asia) in the event of a threat from Japan. A war with Germany would require the majority of the Royal Navy&#x27;s ships to stay within European waters, and an inability to execute the Singapore strategy as planned was widely feared in Canberra to be a strong encouragement for Japan to strike south against Australia. However, Menzies had a strong faith in the ability of Neville Chamberlain to handle the Danzig crisis. Menzies believed that the crisis should and would be resolved by a Munich-type deal under which the Free City of Danzig would be peacefully allowed to &quot;go home to the &quot;Reich&quot;&quot; while at the same time Germany should and would be deterred from going to war against Poland. Though Menzies felt that Poland was in the wrong in opposing the return of the Free City to Germany, he did not want to see the crisis end with Poland being subjected to Germany.

Several times, Menzies declared that there were &quot;two sides&quot; both equally worthy of consideration to the Danzig dispute. He dismissed the &quot;jitters&quot;, as he called it, on the stock market in the summer of 1939 while he spoke of &quot;an outpouring of the sentiments of peace in the minds of the people&quot;. Throughout the summer of 1939, Menzies stressed in his speeches that war was &quot;not inevitable&quot; as he urged Australians to enjoy their summer vacations. In the cabinet, Menzies was opposed to expanding the tiny Australian Army beyond its current size of 1, 571 soldiers on economic grounds. The news of the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact of 22 August 1939 was greeted with both relief and concern in Menzies&#x27;s cabinet. It was understood that the German-Soviet nonaggression pact ended the prospect of a &quot;peace front&quot; of Britain, France and the Soviet Union to deter Germany from invading Poland, and that war was more likely than not in Europe. Conversely, the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact had (temporarily as it proved) alienated Japan from Germany, and within the Australian cabinet, it was felt that Japan would be less likely to enter a war against the British empire because of the German-Soviet agreement, which had come as a most unwanted surprise in Tokyo. In Tokyo, the failure to achieve an alliance with Germany alongside the shock of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact caused the Japanese Prime Minister Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō to submit his resignation to the Emperor, which was accepted. The possibility that at least for the moment that Japan would stay neutral if the Danzig crisis led to war in Europe encouraged the cabinet in Canberra to stand by Britain.

===At war===
On 3 September 1939 Britain and France declared war on Germany due to its invasion of Poland on 1 September, leading to the start of World War II. Menzies responded immediately by also declaring Australia to be at war in support of Britain, and delivered a radio broadcast to the nation on that same day, which began &quot;Fellow Australians. It is my melancholy duty to inform you officially that in consequence of a persistence by Germany in her invasion of Poland, Great Britain has declared war upon her and that, as a result, Australia is also at war.&quot; A couple of days after the declaration, Menzies recalled parliament and asked for general support as the government faced the enormous responsibility of leading the nation in war time. Page and Curtin, as party leaders, pledged their support for all that needed to be done for the defence of the country.

Thus, Menzies at the age of 44 found himself a wartime leader of a small nation of 7 million people. He was especially worried about the military threat from Japan. Australia had very small forces, and depended on Britain for defence against the looming threat of the Japanese Empire, with its 100 million people, a very powerful Army and Navy and an aggressive foreign policy. He hoped that a policy of appeasement would head off a war with Japan, and repeatedly pressured London. Menzies did his best to rally the country, but the bitter memories of the disillusionment which followed World War I made his task difficult; this was compounded by his lack of a service record. Furthermore, as attorney-general and deputy prime minister, he had made an official visit to Germany in 1938, when the official policy of the Australian government, supported by the Opposition, was strong support for Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s policy of Appeasement. Menzies, then also holding the responsibility for the Department of Munitions created a couple of months earlier, led the Coalition into the 1940 election and suffered an eight-seat swing, losing the slender majority he had inherited from Lyons. The result was a hung parliament, with the Coalition two seats short of a majority. Menzies managed to form a minority government with the support of two independent MPs, Arthur Coles and Alex Wilson. Labor, led by John Curtin, refused Menzies&#x27;s offer to form a war coalition, and opposed using the Australian army for a European war, preferring to keep it at home to defend Australia. Labor agreed to participate in the Advisory War Council.

===Strategic debates===
Menzies sent the bulk of the army to help the British in the Middle East and Singapore, and told Winston Churchill the Royal Navy needed to strengthen its Far Eastern forces. On 11 August 1940, Churchill sent a long letter to Menzies promising that if Japan entered the war, Britain would activate the Singapore strategy by sending a strong Royal Navy force to Singapore. Menzies continued to be worried about the fact that the Singapore base-despite being billed as the &quot;Gibraltar of the East&quot; was a base, not the fortress that it was presented as; about the shoddy state of the fortifications at Singapore; and about the lack of details in Churchill&#x27;s promises. 

Just before the September 1940 election, on 13 August 1940, three members of Menzies&#x27;s cabinet had been killed in an air crash—the Canberra air disaster—along with General Brudenell White, Chief of the General Staff; two other passengers and four crew. This event weakened Menzies&#x27;s government. On the night of 11 November 1940, aircraft from the carriers of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Mediterranean fleet disabled a number of Italian capital ships at anchor at the Italian base at Taranto. In December 1940, Menzies sent Churchill a letter expressing concern that the Imperial Japanese Navy might likewise use air power to cripple the Singapore base. In the same letter, Menzies asked Churchill to activate the Singapore strategy by stationing at least three or four capital ships at Singapore. In response, Churchill wrote back to Menzies that to say he would not have capital ships &quot;sitting idle&quot; at Singapore and that to transfer capital ships to Singapore would mean &quot;ruining the Mediterranean situation. This I am sure you would not want to do unless or until the Japanese danger became far more menacing than at present&quot;. In March 1941 and again in August 1941, Menzies appealed to Churchill in letters to activate the Singapore strategy as he wrote that he was highly concerned about Japanese ambitions in the Asia-Pacific region.

From 24 January 1941, Menzies spent four months in Britain discussing war strategy with Churchill and other Empire leaders, while his position at home deteriorated. &quot;En route&quot; to the UK he took the opportunity to stop over to visit Australian troops serving in the North African Campaign. On 20 February 1941, Churchill asked Menzies to give his approval to send the Australian forces in North Africa to Greece. Like many other Australians of his generation, Menzies was haunted by the memory of the Battle of Gallipoli-which came about because of Churchill&#x27;s plans to send an Allied fleet up the Dardanelles-and he was highly suspicious of another of Churchill&#x27;s plans for victory in the Mediterranean. On 25 February 1941, Menzies reluctantly gave his approval to send the 6th Division to Greece. Professor David Day, an Australian historian, has posited that Menzies might have replaced Churchill as British prime minister, and that he had some support in the UK for this. Support came from Viscount Astor, Lord Beaverbrook and former WWI Prime Minister David Lloyd George, who were trenchant critics of Churchill&#x27;s purportedly autocratic style, and favoured replacing him with Menzies, who had some public support for staying on in the War Cabinet for the duration, which was strongly backed by Sir Maurice Hankey, former WWI Colonel and member of both the WWI and WWII War Cabinets. Writer Gerard Henderson has rejected this theory, but history professors Judith Brett and Joan Beaumont support Day, as does Menzies&#x27;s daughter, Heather Henderson, who claimed Lady Astor &quot;even offered all her sapphires if he would stay on in England&quot;.

Menzies came home to a hero&#x27;s welcome. However, his support in Parliament was less certain. Not only did some Coalition MPs doubt his popularity in the electorate, but they also believed that a national unity government was the only long-term solution. Menzies&#x27;s reputation was badly damaged by the failure of the Allied expedition to Greece, in which Australian troops played a prominent role. &quot;The Australian Worker&quot; newspaper in an editorial on 11 June 1941 attacked Menzies for having &quot;too readily acquiesced in the ill-starred Greek campaign, of which the Cretan misadventure was the inevitable sequel ... As a military adventure, it was madness. As a political gesture, it was stupid because it was doomed to failure.&quot; Menzies sought to blame General Sir Thomas Blamey for the Greek expedition as he maintained that he had only given permission to send the Australians to Greece after Blamey did not oppose it. Menzies maintained that if Blamey had given his disapproval in his opinion as a professional soldier, he would never have sent the Australians to Greece. Matters came to a head in August, when the cabinet voted to have Menzies return to London to speak for Australia&#x27;s interests in the War Cabinet. However, since Labor and the Coalition were level (both sides had 36 MPs), Menzies needed the support of the Labor Party in order to travel to Britain. Amid rumours that Menzies&#x27;s real intention was to launch a political career in Britain, Labor insisted that the crisis was too dire for Menzies to leave the country.

===Downfall===
With Labor unwilling to support him travelling to London and his position within his own party room weakening, Menzies called an emergency cabinet meeting. He announced his intention to resign and advise the Governor-General, Lord Gowrie to commission Curtin as prime minister. The Cabinet instead urged Menzies to make another overture to Labor for a national unity government, but Labor turned the offer down. With his position now untenable, Menzies resigned the prime ministership on 27 August 1941.

A joint UAP-Country Party conference chose Country Party leader Arthur Fadden as Coalition leader—and hence Prime Minister—even though the Country Party was the junior partner in the Coalition. Menzies was bitter about this treatment from his colleagues, and nearly left politics, but was persuaded to become Minister for Defence Co-ordination in Fadden&#x27;s cabinet. The Fadden government lasted only 40 days before being defeated on a confidence motion. On 9 October 1941, Menzies resigned as leader of the UAP after failing to convince his colleagues that he should become Leader of the Opposition in preference to Fadden. He was replaced as UAP leader by former prime minister Billy Hughes, who was 79 years old at the time.

==Interregnum==
=== Menzies&#x27;s &quot;Forgotten People&quot; ===
During his time in the political wilderness Menzies built up a large popular base of support by his frequent appeals, often by radio, to ordinary non-elite working citizens whom he called &#x27;the Forgotten People&#x27;—especially those who were not suburban and rich or members of organised labour. From November 1941, he began a series of weekly radio broadcasts reaching audiences across New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. A selection of these talks was edited into a book bearing the title of his most famous address, &quot;The Forgotten People&quot;, delivered on 22 May 1942. In this landmark address, Menzies appealed to his support base:

I do not believe that the real life of this nation is to be found either in great luxury hotels and the petty gossip of so-called fashionable suburbs, or in the officialdom of the organised masses. It is to be found in the homes of people who are nameless and unadvertised, and who, whatever their individual religious conviction or dogma, see in their children their greatest contribution to the immortality of their race. The home is the foundation of sanity and sobriety; it is the indispensable condition of continuity; its health determines the health of society as a whole.

Menzies himself described &quot;The Forgotten People&quot; collection as &#x27;a summarised political philosophy&#x27;. Representing the blueprint of his liberal philosophy, &quot;The Forgotten People&quot; encompassed a wide range of topics including Roosevelt&#x27;s Four Freedoms, the control of the war, the role of women in war and peace, the future of capitalism, the nature of democracy and especially the role of the middle class, &#x27;the forgotten people&#x27; of the title and their importance to Australia&#x27;s future as a democracy. The addresses frequently emphasised the values which Menzies regarded as critical to shaping Australia&#x27;s wartime and postwar policies. These were essentially the principles of liberalism: individual freedom, personal and community responsibility, the rule of law, parliamentary government, economic prosperity and progress based on private enterprise and reward for effort.

After losing the UAP leadership, Menzies moved to the backbench. Besides his overall sense of duty, the war would have made it nearly impossible for him to return to his legal practice in any event. Labor won a crushing victory at the 1943 election, taking 49 of 74 seats and 58.2 percent of the two-party-preferred vote as well as a Senate majority. The Coalition, which had sunk into near-paralysis in opposition, was knocked down to only 19 seats. Hughes resigned as UAP leader, and Menzies was elected as his successor on the second ballot, defeating three other candidates. The UAP also voted to end the joint opposition arrangement with the Country Party, allowing Menzies to replace Fadden as opposition leader.

=== Formation of the Liberal Party ===
Soon after his return, Menzies concluded that the UAP was at the end of its useful life. Menzies called a conference of anti-Labor parties with meetings in Canberra on 13 October 1944 and again in Albury (NSW) in December 1944. At the Canberra conference, the fourteen parties, with the UAP as the nucleus, decided to merge as one new non-Labor party—the Liberal Party of Australia. The organisational structure and constitutional framework of the new party was formulated at the Albury Conference. Officially launched at the Sydney Town Hall on 31 August 1945, the Menzies-led Liberal Party of Australia inherited the UAP&#x27;s role as senior partner in the Coalition. Curtin died in office in 1945 and was succeeded by Ben Chifley.

The reconfigured Coalition faced its first national test in the 1946 election. It won 26 of 74 seats on 45.9 percent of the two-party vote and remained in minority in the Senate. Despite winning a seven-seat swing, the Coalition failed to make a serious dent in Labor&#x27;s large majority.

====1949 election campaign====
Over the next few years, however, the anti-communist atmosphere of the early Cold War began to erode Labor&#x27;s support. In 1947, Chifley announced that he intended to nationalise Australia&#x27;s private banks, arousing intense middle-class opposition which Menzies successfully exploited. In addition to campaigning against Chifley&#x27;s bank nationalization proposal, Menzies successfully led the &#x27;No&#x27; case for a referendum by the Chifley government in 1948 to extend commonwealth wartime powers to control rents and prices. In the election campaign of 1949, Menzies and his party were resolved to stamp out the communist movement and to fight in the interests of free enterprise against what they termed as Labor&#x27;s &#x27;socialistic measures&#x27;. If Menzies won office, he pledged to counter inflation, extend child endowment and end petrol rationing. With the lower house enlarged from 74 to 121 seats, the Menzies Liberal/Country Coalition won the 1949 election with 74 House seats and 51.0 percent of the two-party vote but remained in minority in the Senate. Whatever else Menzies&#x27;s victory represented, his anti-communism and advocacy for free enterprise had captured a new and formidable support base in postwar Australian society.

==Second prime ministership==
After his election victory, Menzies returned to the office of prime minister on 19 December 1949.

=== Cold War and national security ===
The spectre of communism and the threat it was deemed to pose to national security became the dominant preoccupation of the new government in its first phase. Menzies introduced legislation in 1950 to ban the Communist Party, hoping that the Senate would reject it and give him a trigger for a double dissolution election, but Labor let the bill pass. It was subsequently ruled unconstitutional by the High Court. But when the Senate rejected his banking bill, he called a double dissolution election. At that election, the Coalition suffered a five-seat swing, winning 69 of 121 seats and 50.7 percent of the two-party vote. However, it won six seats in the Senate, giving it control of both chambers. Later in 1951 Menzies decided to hold a referendum on the question of changing the Constitution to permit the parliament to make laws in respect of Communists and Communism where he said this was necessary for the security of the Commonwealth. If passed, this would have given a government the power to introduce a bill proposing to ban the Communist Party. Chifley died a few months after the 1951 election. The new Labor leader, H. V. Evatt, campaigned against the referendum on civil liberties grounds, and it was narrowly defeated. Menzies sent Australian troops to the Korean War. 

Economic conditions deteriorated in the early 1950s and Labor was confident of winning the 1954 election. Menzies engaged in red-baiting of political opponents. Shortly before the election, Menzies announced that a Soviet diplomat in Australia Vladimir Petrov, had defected, and that there was evidence of a Soviet spy ring in Australia, including members of Evatt&#x27;s staff. Evatt felt compelled to state on the floor of Parliament that he&#x27;d personally written to Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov, who assured him there were no Soviet spy rings in Australia, bringing the House into silence momentarily before both sides of Parliament laughed at Evatt&#x27;s naivety.

This Cold War scare was claimed by some to enable the Menzies government to win the election. The Menzies government won 64 of 121 seats and 49.3 percent of the two-party vote. Evatt accused Menzies of arranging Petrov&#x27;s defection. The aftermath of the 1954 election caused a split in the Labor Party, with several anti-Communist members from Victoria defecting to form the Australian Labor Party (Anti-Communist). The new party directed its preferences to the Liberals, with the Menzies government re-elected with an increased majority at the 1955 election. Menzies was re-elected almost as easily at the 1958 election, again with the help of preferences from what had become the Democratic Labor Party.

=== Foreign policy ===


The Menzies era saw immense regional changes, with post-war reconstruction and the withdrawal of European Powers and the British Empire from the Far East (including independence for India and Indonesia). In response to these geopolitical developments, the Menzies government maintained strong ties with Australia&#x27;s traditional allies such as Britain and the United States while also reorienting Australia&#x27;s foreign policy focus towards the Asia Pacific. With his first Minister for External Affairs, Percy Spender, the Menzies government signed the ANZUS treaty in San Francisco on 1 September 1951. Menzies later told parliament that this security pact between Australia, New Zealand and the United States was &#x27;based on the utmost good will, the utmost good faith and unqualified friendship&#x27; saying &#x27;each of us will stand by it&#x27;. At the same time as strengthening the alliance with the United States, Menzies and Spender were committed to Australia being on &#x27;good neighbour terms&#x27; with the countries of South and South East Asia. To help forge closer ties in the region, the Menzies government initiated the Colombo Plan that would see almost 40 000 students from the region come to study in Australia over the four subsequent decades. Recognising the economic potential of a burgeoning postwar Japan, Menzies, together with Trade Minister Jack McEwan and his new minister for External Affairs, Richard Casey, negotiated the Commerce Agreement with Japan in 1957. This trade agreement was followed by bilateral agreements with Malaya in 1958 and Indonesia in 1959.

=== Economic policy ===
Throughout his second period in office, Menzies practised classical liberal economics with an emphasis on private enterprise and self-sufficiency in contrast to Labor&#x27;s &#x27;socialist objective&#x27;. Accordingly, the economic policy emphasis of the Menzies government moved towards tax incentives to release productive capacity, boosting export markets, research and undertaking public works to provide power, water and communications.

In 1951, the top marginal tax rate for incomes above £10,000 (equivalent to $487,272.73 in 2022) was 75 per cent under Menzies; from 1955 until the mid-1980s, the top marginal tax rate was 67 per cent.

=== Social reform ===
In 1949, Parliament legislated to ensure that all Aboriginal ex-servicemen should have the right to vote. In 1961 a Parliamentary Committee was established to investigate and report to the Parliament on Aboriginal voting rights, and in 1962, Menzies&#x27;s &quot;Commonwealth Electoral Act&quot; provided that all Indigenous Australians should have the right to enrol and vote at federal elections.

In 1960, the Menzies government introduced a new pharmaceutical benefits scheme, which expanded the range of prescribed medicines subsidised by the government. Other social welfare measures of the government included the extension of the Commonwealth Child Endowment scheme, the pensioner medical and free medicines service, the Aged Persons&#x27; Homes Assistance scheme, free provision of life-saving drugs; the provision of supplementary pensions to dependent pensioners paying rent; increased rates of pension, unemployment and sickness benefits, and rehabilitation allowances; and a substantial system of tax incentives and rewards. In 1961, the &quot;Matrimonial Causes Act&quot; introduced a uniform divorce law across Australia, provided funding for marriage counselling services and made allowances for a specified period of separation as sufficient grounds for a divorce.

In response to the decision by the Catholic Diocese of Goulburn in July 1962 to close its schools in protest at the lack of government assistance, the Menzies government announced a new package of state aid for independent and Catholic schools. Menzies promised five million pounds annually for the provision of buildings and equipment facilities for science teaching in secondary schools. Also promised were 10 000 scholarships to help students stay at school for the last two years with a further 2 500 scholarships for technical schools. Despite the historically firm Catholic support base of the Labor Party, the Opposition under Arthur Calwell opposed state aid before eventually supporting it with the ascension of Gough Whitlam as Labor leader.

In 1965, the Menzies government took the decision to end open discrimination against married women in the public service, by allowing them to become permanent public servants, and allowing female officers who were already permanent public servants to retain that status after marriage.

=== Immigration policy ===
The Menzies government maintained and indeed expanded the Chifley Labor government&#x27;s postwar immigration scheme established by Immigration Minister Arthur Calwell in 1947. Beginning in 1949, Immigration Minister Harold Holt decided to allow 800 non-European war refugees to remain in Australia, and Japanese war brides to be admitted to Australia. In 1950, External Affairs Minister Percy Spender instigated the Colombo Plan, under which students from Asian countries were admitted to study at Australian universities, then in 1957, non-Europeans with 15 years&#x27; residence in Australia were allowed to become citizens. In a watershed legal reform, a 1958 revision of the Migration Act introduced a simpler system for entry and abolished the &quot;dictation test&quot; which had permitted the exclusion of migrants on the basis of their ability to take down a dictation offered in any European language. Immigration Minister Alick Downer announced that &quot;distinguished and highly qualified Asians&quot; might immigrate. Restrictions continued to be relaxed through the 1960s in the lead-up to the Holt government&#x27;s watershed &quot;Migration Act, 1966&quot;.

This was despite a discussion with radio 2UE&#x27;s Stewart Lamb in 1955, in which Menzies was a defender of the White Australia policy:

(Menzies) &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see reproduced in Australia the kind of problem they have in South Africa or in America or increasingly in Great Britain. I think it&#x27;s been a very good policy and it&#x27;s been of great value to us and most of the criticism of it that I&#x27;ve ever heard doesn&#x27;t come from these oriental countries it comes from wandering Australians.

(Lamb) &quot;For these years of course in the past Sir Robert you have been described as a racist.&quot;

(Menzies) &quot;Have I?&quot;

(Lamb) &quot;I have read this, yes.&quot;

(Menzies) &quot;Well if I were not described as a racist I&#x27;d be the only public man who hasn&#x27;t been.&quot;

=== Higher education expansion ===
The Menzies government extended Federal involvement in higher education and introduced the Commonwealth scholarship scheme in 1951, to cover fees and pay a generous means-tested allowance for promising students from lower socioeconomic groups. In 1956, a committee headed by Sir Keith Murray was established to inquire into the financial plight of Australia&#x27;s universities, and Menzies&#x27;s pumped funds into the sector under conditions which preserved the autonomy of universities. In its support for higher education, the Menzies government tripled Federal government funding and provided emergency grants, significant increases in academic salaries, extra funding for buildings, and the establishment of a permanent committee, from 1961, to oversee and make recommendations concerning higher education.

=== Development of Canberra ===
The Menzies government developed the city of Canberra as the national capital. In 1957, the Menzies government established the National Capital Development Commission as independent statutory authority charged with overseeing the planning and development of Canberra. During Menzies&#x27; time in office, the great bulk of the federal public service moved from the state capitals to Canberra.

==Later life==
Menzies turned 71 in December 1965 and began telling others of his intention to retire in the new year. He informed cabinet of his decision on 19 January 1966 and resigned as leader of the Liberal Party the following day; Harold Holt was elected unopposed as his successor. Holt&#x27;s swearing-in was delayed by the death of Defence Minister Shane Paltridge on 21 January. Menzies and Holt were pallbearers at Paltridge&#x27;s state funeral in Perth on 25 January, before returning to Canberra where Menzies formally concluded his term on 26 January.

Menzies&#x27;s farewell press conference was the first political press conference telecast live in Australia. He resigned from Parliament on 17 February, ending 32 years in Parliament (most of them spent as either a cabinet minister or opposition frontbencher), a combined 25 years as leader of the non-Labor Coalition, and 38 years as an elected official. To date, Menzies is the last Australian prime minister to leave office on his or her own terms. He was succeeded as Liberal Party leader and prime minister by his former treasurer, Harold Holt. He left office at the age of 71 years, 1 month and 6 days, making him the oldest person ever to be prime minister. Although the coalition remained in power for almost another seven years (until the 1972 Federal election), it did so under four different prime ministers, in part due to his successor&#x27;s death, only 22 months after taking office.

On his retirement he became the thirteenth chancellor of the University of Melbourne and remained the head of the university from March 1967 until March 1972. Much earlier, in 1942, he had received the first honorary degree of Doctor of Laws of Melbourne University. His responsibility for the revival and growth of university life in Australia was widely acknowledged by the award of honorary degrees in the Universities of Queensland, Adelaide, Tasmania, New South Wales, and the Australian National University and by thirteen universities in Canada, the United States and Britain, including Oxford and Cambridge. Many learned institutions, including the Royal College of Surgeons (Hon. FRCS) and the Royal Australasian College of Physicians (Hon. FRACP), elected him to Honorary Fellowships, and the Australian Academy of Science, for which he supported its establishment in 1954, made him a fellow (FAAS) in 1958. On 7 October 1965, Menzies was installed as the ceremonial office of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports and Constable of Dover Castle as appointed by the Queen, which included an official residence at Walmer Castle during his annual visits to Britain. At the end of 1966 Menzies took up a scholar-in-residence position at the University of Virginia. He presented a series of lectures, published the following year as &quot;Central Power in the Australian Commonwealth&quot;. He later published two volumes of memoirs. In March 1967 he was elected Chancellor of Melbourne University, serving a five-year term. In 1971, Menzies suffered a severe stroke and was permanently paralysed on one side of his body for the remainder of his life. He suffered a second stroke in 1972. His official biographer, Lady McNicoll wrote after his death in &quot;The Australian&quot; that Menzies was &quot;splendid and sharp right up until the end&quot; also that &quot;each morning he underwent physiotherapy and being helped to face the day.&quot; In March 1977, Menzies accepted his knighthood of the Order of Australia (AK) from Queen Elizabeth in a wheelchair in the Long Room of the Melbourne Cricket Ground during the Centenary Test.

== Personal life ==
On 27 September 1920, Menzies married Pattie Leckie at Kew Presbyterian Church in Melbourne. Pattie Leckie was the eldest daughter of John Leckie, a Deakinite Commonwealth Liberal who was elected the member for the Electoral district of Benambra in the Victorian Legislative Assembly in 1913. Soon after their marriage, the Menzies bought the house in Howard Street, Kew, which would become their family home for 25 years. They had three surviving children: Kenneth (1922–1993), Robert Jr (known by his middle name, Ian; 1923–1974) and a daughter, Margery (known by her middle name, Heather; born 1928). Another child died at birth.

Kenneth was born in Hawthorn on 14 January 1922. He married Marjorie Cook on 16 September 1949, and had six children: Alec, Lindsay, Robert III, Diana, Donald, and Geoffrey. He died in Kooyong on 8 September 1993. Ian and Heather were both born in Kew, on 12 October 1923 and 3 August 1928, respectively. Ian was afflicted with an undisclosed illness for most of his life. He never married, nor had children, and died in 1974 in East Melbourne at the age of 50. Heather married Peter Henderson, a diplomat and public servant (working at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia at the time of their marriage, and serving as the Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs from 1979 to 1984), on 1 May 1955. A daughter, Roberta, named after Menzies, was born in 1956.

According to Mungo MacCallum, Menzies as prime minister engaged in an affair with Betty Fairfax, the first wife of Sir Warwick Oswald Fairfax. That claim was subsequently disputed by Gerard Henderson and Menzies&#x27;s own family.

==Death and funeral==
Menzies died from a heart attack while reading in his study at his Haverbrack Avenue home in Malvern, Melbourne on 15 May 1978. Tributes from across the world were sent to the Menzies family. Notably among those were from HM Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Australia: &quot;I was distressed to hear of the death of Sir Robert Menzies. He was a distinguished Australian whose contribution to his country and the Commonwealth will long be remembered&quot;, and from Malcolm Fraser, Prime Minister of Australia: &quot;All Australians will mourn his passing. Sir Robert leaves an enduring mark on Australian history.&quot;

Menzies was accorded a state funeral, held in Scots&#x27; Church, Melbourne on 19 May, at which Prince Charles represented the Queen. Other dignitaries to attend included current and former Prime Ministers of Australia Malcolm Fraser, John McEwen, John Gorton and William McMahon (the two surviving Labor Prime Ministers, Frank Forde and Gough Whitlam, did not attend the funeral), as well as the Governor General of Australia, Sir Zelman Cowan. Former Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom Alec Douglas-Home and Harold Wilson also attended.

The service was and is to this day one of the largest state funerals ever held in Australia, with over 100,000 people lining the streets of Melbourne from Scots&#x27; Church to Springvale Crematorium, where a private service was held for the Menzies family and a 19-gun salute was fired at the end of the ceremony. In July 1978, a memorial service was held for Menzies in the United Kingdom at Westminster Abbey. Sir Robert and Dame Pattie Menzies&#x27;s ashes are interred in the &#x27;Prime Ministers Garden&#x27; within the grounds of Melbourne General Cemetery.

Some of Menzies&#x27;s detractors also commemorated his passing in 1978, with a screenprinted poster, &quot;Pig Iron Bob / Dead at last&quot;, designed by Chips Mackinolty from the Earthworks Poster Collective.

== Religious views ==
Menzies was the son of a Presbyterian-turned-Methodist lay preacher and imbibed his father&#x27;s Protestant faith and values. During his studies at the University of Melbourne, Menzies was president of the Students&#x27; Christian Union. Proud of his Scottish Presbyterian heritage with a living faith steeped in the Bible, Menzies nonetheless preached religious freedom and non-sectarianism as the norm for Australia. Indeed, his cooperation with Australian Catholics on the contentious state aid issue was recognised when he was invited as guest of honour to the annual Cardinal&#x27;s Dinner in Sydney in 1964, presided over by Cardinal Norman Gilroy.

==Legacy and assessment==
Menzies was by far the longest serving Prime Minister of Australia, in office for a combined total of 18 years, five months and 12 days. His second period of 16 years, one month and seven days is by far the longest unbroken tenure in that office. During his second period he dominated Australian politics as no one else has ever done. He managed to live down the failures of his first period in office and to rebuild the conservative side of politics from the nadir it hit at the 1943 election. However, it can also be noted that while retaining government on each occasion, Menzies lost the two-party-preferred vote at three separate elections – in 1940, 1954 and 1961.

He was the only Australian prime minister to recommend the appointment of four governors-general (Viscount Slim, and Lords Dunrossil, De L&#x27;Isle, and Casey). Only two other prime ministers have ever chosen more than one governor-general.

The Menzies era saw Australia become an increasingly affluent society, with average weekly earnings in 1965 50% higher in real terms than in 1945. The increased prosperity enjoyed by most Australians during this period was accompanied by a general increase in leisure time, with the five-day workweek becoming the norm by the mid-1960s, together with three weeks of paid annual leave.

Several books have been filled with anecdotes about Menzies. While he was speaking in Williamstown, Victoria, in 1954, a heckler shouted, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t vote for you if you were the Archangel Gabriel&quot;to which Menzies coolly replied, &quot;If I were the Archangel Gabriel, I&#x27;m afraid you wouldn&#x27;t be in my constituency.&quot;

Jo Gullett, who first knew him as a family friend of his father, Henry Gullett, wartime Minister for External Affairs, and who later served under Menzies as a Liberal Party member of parliament himself in Canberra in the 1950s, offered this assessment:

Planning for an official biography of Menzies began soon after his death, but it was long delayed by Dame Pattie Menzies&#x27;s protection of her husband&#x27;s reputation and her refusal to co-operate with the appointed biographer. In 1991, the Menzies family appointed A. W. Martin to write a biography, which appeared in two volumes, in 1993 and 1999. In 2019, Troy Bramston, a journalist for &quot;The Australian&quot; and a political historian, wrote the first biography of Menzies since Martin&#x27;s two volumes, titled &quot;Robert Menzies: The Art of Politics&quot;. Bramston had access to previously unavailable Menzies family papers, conducted new interviews with Menzies&#x27; contemporaries and it was endorsed by Menzies&#x27; daughter, Heather Henderson. It was described as having &quot;the most attractive combination of research and readability&quot; of all the Menzies biographies. The National Museum of Australia in Canberra holds a significant collection of memorabilia relating to Robert Menzies, including a range of medals and civil awards received by Sir Robert such as his Jubilee and Coronation medals, Order of Australia, Order of the Companions of Honour and US Legion of Merit. There are also a number of special presentation items including a walking stick, cigar boxes, silver gravy boats from the Kooyong electorate and a silver inkstand presented by Queen Elizabeth II. Robert Menzies&#x27;s personal library of almost 4,000 books is held at the University of Melbourne Library.

He was the second of only two Australian prime ministers to be knighted during their term of office (the first prime minister, Edmund Barton, was knighted during his term in 1902).
* On 29 April 1964, Menzies was awarded the honorary degree of a Doctor of Letters (DLitt) by the University of Western Australia. Menzies was also awarded with an Honorary Doctor of Science by the University of New South Wales.
* In 1973, Menzies was awarded Japan&#x27;s Order of the Rising Sun, Grand Cordon, First Class (other Australian prime ministers to be awarded this honour were Edmund Barton, John McEwen, Malcolm Fraser and Gough Whitlam).
* On 7 June 1976, he was appointed a Knight of the Order of Australia (AK). The category of Knight of the order had been created only on 24 May, and the Chancellor and Principal Knight of the Order, the Governor-General Sir John Kerr, became the first appointee, &quot;ex officio&quot;. Menzies&#x27;s was the first appointment made after this.
* In 1984, the Australian Electoral Commission proclaimed at a redistribution on 14 September 1984, the Division of Menzies for representation in the Australian House of Representatives in honour of the former prime minister. The division neighbours Menzies&#x27;s old division of Kooyong in metropolitan Melbourne, Victoria.
* In 1994, the year of the centenary of Menzies&#x27;s birth, the Menzies Research Centre was created as an independent public policy think tank associated with the Liberal Party.
* In 2009, during the Australia Day celebrations, the &quot;R.G. Menzies Walk&quot; was officially opened by the then Governor-General, Quentin Bryce. The walk runs alongside the northern shore of Lake Burley Griffin in Australia&#x27;s capital, Canberra.
* In 2012, a life-sized bronze statue of Menzies was erected on the R.G. Menzies Walk. 
* Sir Robert Menzies Park, in Wahroonga, New South Wales 
* Sir Robert Menzies Reserve, in Malvern, Victoria

<doc id="25840" wikidata="Q201405" url="?curid=25840" title="Renaissance music">
<text>Renaissance music is traditionally understood to cover European music of the 15th and 16th centuries, later than the Renaissance era as it is understood in other disciplines. Rather than starting from the early 14th-century &quot;ars nova&quot;, the Trecento music was treated by musicology as a coda to medieval music and the new era dated from the rise of triadic harmony and the spread of the &quot;contenance angloise&quot; style from the British Isles to the Burgundian School. A convenient watershed for its end is the adoption of basso continuo at the beginning of the Baroque period.

The period may be roughly subdivided, with an early period corresponding to the career of Guillaume Du Fay (–1474) and the cultivation of cantilena style, a middle dominated by Franco-Flemish School and the four-part textures favored by Johannes Ockeghem (1410s or &#x27;20s–1497) and Josquin des Prez (late 1450s–1521), and culminating during the Counter-Reformation in the florid counterpoint of Palestrina (–1594) and the Roman School.

Music was increasingly freed from medieval constraints, and more variety was permitted in range, rhythm, harmony, form, and notation. On the other hand, rules of counterpoint became more constrained, particularly with regard to treatment of dissonances. In the Renaissance, music became a vehicle for personal expression. Composers found ways to make vocal music more expressive of the texts they were setting. Secular music absorbed techniques from sacred music, and vice versa. Popular secular forms such as the chanson and madrigal spread throughout Europe. Courts employed virtuoso performers, both singers and instrumentalists. Music also became more self-sufficient with its availability in printed form, existing for its own sake.

Precursor versions of many familiar modern instruments (including the violin, guitar, lute and keyboard instruments) developed into new forms during the Renaissance. These instruments were modified to respond to the evolution of musical ideas, and they presented new possibilities for composers and musicians to explore. Early forms of modern woodwind and brass instruments like the bassoon and trombone also appeared, extending the range of sonic color and increasing the sound of instrumental ensembles. During the 15th century, the sound of full triads became common, and towards the end of the 16th century the system of church modes began to break down entirely, giving way to functional tonality (the system in which songs and pieces are based on musical &quot;keys&quot;), which would dominate Western art music for the next three centuries.

From the Renaissance era, notated secular and sacred music survives in quantity, including vocal and instrumental works and mixed vocal/instrumental works. A wide range of musical styles and genres flourished during the Renaissance, including masses, motets, madrigals, chansons, accompanied songs, instrumental dances, and many others. Beginning in the late 20th century, numerous early music ensembles were formed. Ensembles specializing in music of the Renaissance era give concert tours and make recordings, using modern reproductions of historical instruments and using singing and performing styles which musicologists believe were used during the era.

==Overview==
The main characteristics of Renaissance music are:
* Music based on modes.
* Rich texture, with four or more independent melodic parts being performed simultaneously. These interweaving melodic lines, a style called polyphony, is one of the defining features of Renaissance music.
* Blending, rather than contrasting, melodic lines in the musical texture.
* Harmony that placed a greater concern on the smooth flow of the music and its progression of chords.

The development of polyphony produced the notable changes in musical instruments that mark the Renaissance musically from the Middle Ages. Its use encouraged the development of larger ensembles and demanded sets of instruments that would blend together across the whole vocal range.

One of the most pronounced features of early Renaissance European art music was the increasing reliance on the interval of the third and its inversion, the sixth. (In the Middle Ages, thirds and sixths had been considered dissonances; and consonances were derived only of the perfect intervals: the perfect fourth, the perfect fifth, the octave, and the unison). Polyphony—the use of multiple, independent melodic lines played simultaneously—became increasingly elaborate throughout the 14th century, with highly independent voices in both vocal music and instrumental music. The beginning of the 15th century showed simplification, with the composers often striving for smoothness in the melodic parts. This was possible because of a greatly increased vocal range in music. Previously, in the Middle Ages, the narrow vocal range necessitated frequent crossing of parts, thus requiring a greater contrast between them to distinguish the different parts. 

The modal character of Renaissance music—later replaced by the tonal approach developing in the subsequent Baroque music era—began to break down towards the end of the (Renaissance) period with the increased use of root motions of fifths or fourths; (see Circle of fifths for details). An example of a chord progression in which the chord roots move by the interval of a fourth is the chord progression in the key of C Major: &quot;D minor/G Major/C Major&quot;—these are all triads; three-note chords. The movement from the D minor chord to the G Major chord is an interval of a perfect fourth. The movement from the G Major chord to the C Major chord is also an interval of a perfect fourth. This later developed into one of the defining characteristics of tonality during the Baroque era.

=== Background ===
As in the other arts, the music of the period was significantly influenced by the developments which define the Early Modern period: the rise of humanistic thought; the recovery of the literary and artistic heritage of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome; increased innovation and discovery; the growth of commercial enterprises; the rise of a bourgeois class; and the Protestant Reformation. From this changing society emerged a common, unifying musical language, in particular, the polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish school.

The invention of the printing press in 1439 made it cheaper and easier to distribute music and music theory texts on a wider geographic scale and to more people. Prior to the invention of printing, written music and music theory texts had to be hand-copied, a time-consuming and expensive process. Demand for music as entertainment and as a leisure activity for educated amateurs increased with the emergence of a bourgeois class. Dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout Europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style which culminated in the second half of the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, Orlande de Lassus, Thomas Tallis, William Byrd and Tomás Luis de Victoria. Relative political stability and prosperity in the Low Countries, along with a flourishing system of music education in the area&#x27;s many churches and cathedrals allowed the training of large numbers of singers, instrumentalists, and composers. These musicians were highly sought throughout Europe, particularly in Italy, where churches and aristocratic courts hired them as composers, performers, and teachers. Since the printing press made it easier to disseminate printed music, by the end of the 16th century, Italy had absorbed the northern musical influences with Venice, Rome, and other cities becoming centers of musical activity. This reversed the situation from a hundred years earlier. Opera, a dramatic staged genre in which singers are accompanied by instruments, arose at this time in Florence. Opera was developed as a deliberate attempt to resurrect the music of ancient Greece.

===Genres===
Principal liturgical (church-based) musical forms, which remained in use throughout the Renaissance period, were masses and motets, with some other developments towards the end of the era, especially as composers of sacred music began to adopt secular (non-religious) musical forms (such as the madrigal) for religious use. The 15th and 16th century masses had two kinds of sources that were used: monophonic (a single melody line) and polyphonic (multiple, independent melodic lines), with two main forms of elaboration, based on &quot;cantus firmus&quot; practice or, beginning some time around 1500, the new style of &quot;pervasive imitation&quot;, in which composers would write music in which the different voices or parts would imitate the melodic and/or rhythmic motifs performed by other voices or parts. Several main types of masses were used:
* Cyclic mass (tenor mass)
* Paraphrase mass
* Imitation mass

Masses were normally titled by the source from which they borrowed. &quot;Cantus firmus&quot; mass uses the same monophonic melody, usually drawn from chant and usually in the tenor and most often in longer note values than the other voices. Other sacred genres were the madrigale spirituale and the laude.

During the period, secular (non-religious) music had an increasing distribution, with a wide variety of forms, but one must be cautious about assuming an explosion in variety: since printing made music more widely available, much more has survived from this era than from the preceding medieval era, and probably a rich store of popular music of the late Middle Ages is lost. Secular music was music that was independent of churches. The main types were the German Lied, Italian frottola, the French chanson, the Italian madrigal, and the Spanish villancico. Other secular vocal genres included the caccia, rondeau, virelai, bergerette, ballade, musique mesurée, canzonetta, villanella, villotta, and the lute song. Mixed forms such as the motet-chanson and the secular motet also appeared.

Purely instrumental music included consort music for recorders or viols and other instruments, and dances for various ensembles. Common instrumental genres were the toccata, prelude, ricercar, and canzona. Dances played by instrumental ensembles (or sometimes sung) included the basse danse (It. &quot;bassadanza&quot;), tourdion, saltarello, pavane, galliard, allemande, courante, bransle, canarie, piva, and lavolta. Music of many genres could be arranged for a solo instrument such as the lute, vihuela, harp, or keyboard. Such arrangements were called intabulations (It. &quot;intavolatura&quot;, Ger. &quot;Intabulierung&quot;).

Towards the end of the period, the early dramatic precursors of opera such as monody, the madrigal comedy, and the intermedio are heard.

===Theory and notation===

According to Margaret Bent: &quot;Renaissance notation is under-prescriptive by our [modern] standards; when translated into modern form it acquires a prescriptive weight that overspecifies and distorts its original openness&quot;. Renaissance compositions were notated only in individual parts; scores were extremely rare, and barlines were not used. Note values were generally larger than are in use today; the primary unit of beat was the semibreve, or whole note. As had been the case since the Ars Nova (see Medieval music), there could be either two or three of these for each breve (a double-whole note), which may be looked on as equivalent to the modern &quot;measure,&quot; though it was itself a note value and a measure is not. The situation can be considered this way: it is the same as the rule by which in modern music a quarter-note may equal either two eighth-notes or three, which would be written as a &quot;triplet.&quot; By the same reckoning, there could be two or three of the next smallest note, the &quot;minim,&quot; (equivalent to the modern &quot;half note&quot;) to each semibreve.

These different permutations were called &quot;perfect/imperfect tempus&quot; at the level of the breve–semibreve relationship, &quot;perfect/imperfect prolation&quot; at the level of the semibreve–minim, and existed in all possible combinations with each other. Three-to-one was called &quot;perfect,&quot; and two-to-one &quot;imperfect.&quot; Rules existed also whereby single notes could be halved or doubled in value (&quot;imperfected&quot; or &quot;altered,&quot; respectively) when preceded or followed by other certain notes. Notes with black noteheads (such as quarter notes) occurred less often. This development of white mensural notation may be a result of the increased use of paper (rather than vellum), as the weaker paper was less able to withstand the scratching required to fill in solid noteheads; notation of previous times, written on vellum, had been black. Other colors, and later, filled-in notes, were used routinely as well, mainly to enforce the aforementioned imperfections or alterations and to call for other temporary rhythmical changes.

Accidentals (e.g. added sharps, flats and naturals that change the notes) were not always specified, somewhat as in certain fingering notations for guitar-family instruments (tablatures) today. However, Renaissance musicians would have been highly trained in dyadic counterpoint and thus possessed this and other information necessary to read a score correctly, even if the accidentals were not written in. As such, &quot;what modern notation requires [accidentals] would then have been perfectly apparent without notation to a singer versed in counterpoint.&quot; (See musica ficta.) A singer would interpret his or her part by figuring cadential formulas with other parts in mind, and when singing together, musicians would avoid parallel octaves and parallel fifths or alter their cadential parts in light of decisions by other musicians. It is through contemporary tablatures for various plucked instruments that we have gained much information about which accidentals were performed by the original practitioners.

For information on specific theorists, see Johannes Tinctoris, Franchinus Gaffurius, Heinrich Glarean, Pietro Aron, Nicola Vicentino, Tomás de Santa María, Gioseffo Zarlino, Vicente Lusitano, Vincenzo Galilei, Giovanni Artusi, Johannes Nucius, and Pietro Cerone.

===Composers – timeline===
==Early period (1400–1470)==
The key composers from the early Renaissance era also wrote in a late medieval style, and as such, they are transitional figures. Leonel Power (c. 1370s or 1380s–1445) was an English composer of the late medieval and early Renaissance music eras. Along with John Dunstaple, he was one of the major figures in English music in the early 15th century. Power is the composer best represented in the &quot;Old Hall Manuscript&quot;, one of the only undamaged sources of English music from the early 15th century. He was one of the first composers to set separate movements of the ordinary of the mass which were thematically unified and intended for contiguous performance. The Old Hall Manuscript contains his mass based on the Marian antiphon, Alma Redemptoris Mater, in which the antiphon is stated literally in the tenor voice in each movement, without melodic ornaments. This is the only cyclic setting of the mass ordinary which can be attributed to him. He wrote mass cycles, fragments, and single movements and a variety of other sacred works.

John Dunstaple (c. 1390–1453) was an English composer of polyphonic music of the late medieval era and early Renaissance periods. He was one of the most famous composers active in the early 15th century, a near-contemporary of Power, and was widely influential, not only in England but on the continent, especially in the developing style of the Burgundian School.
Dunstaple&#x27;s influence on the continent&#x27;s musical vocabulary was enormous, particularly considering the relative paucity of his (attributable) works. He was recognized for possessing something never heard before in music of the Burgundian School: &quot;la contenance angloise&quot; (&quot;the English countenance&quot;), a term used by the poet Martin le Franc in his &quot;Le Champion des Dames.&quot; Le Franc added that the style influenced Dufay and Binchois. Writing a few decades later in about 1476, the Flemish composer and music theorist Tinctoris reaffirmed the powerful influence Dunstaple had, stressing the &quot;new art&quot; that Dunstaple had inspired. Tinctoris hailed Dunstaple as the &quot;fons et origo&quot; of the style, its &quot;wellspring and origin.&quot;

The &quot;contenance angloise&quot;, while not defined by Martin le Franc, was probably a reference to Dunstaple&#x27;s stylistic trait of using full triadic harmony (three note chords), along with a liking for the interval of the third. Assuming that he had been on the continent with the Duke of Bedford, Dunstaple would have been introduced to French &quot;fauxbourdon&quot;; borrowing some of the sonorities, he created elegant harmonies in his own music using thirds and sixths (an example of a third interval is the notes C and E; an example of a sixth interval is the notes C and A). Taken together, these are seen as defining characteristics of early Renaissance music. Many of these traits may have originated in England, taking root in the Burgundian School around the middle of the century.

Because numerous copies of Dunstaple&#x27;s works have been found in Italian and German manuscripts, his fame across Europe must have been widespread. Of the works attributed to him only about fifty survive, among which are two complete masses, three connected mass sections, fourteen individual mass sections, twelve complete isorhythmic motets and seven settings of Marian antiphons, such as &quot;Alma redemptoris Mater&quot; and &quot;Salve Regina, Mater misericordiae&quot;. Dunstaple was one of the first to compose masses using a single melody as &quot;cantus firmus.&quot; A good example of this technique is his &quot;Missa Rex seculorum&quot;. He is believed to have written secular (non-religious) music, but no songs in the vernacular can be attributed to him with any degree of certainty.

Oswald von Wolkenstein (c. 1376–1445) is one of the most important composers of the early German Renaissance. He is best known for his well-written melodies, and for his use of three themes: travel, God and sex.

Gilles Binchois (–1460) was a Dutch composer, one of the earliest members of the Burgundian school and one of the three most famous composers of the early 15th century. While often ranked behind his contemporaries Guillaume Dufay and John Dunstaple by contemporary scholars, his works were still cited, borrowed and used as source material after his death. Binchois is considered to be a fine melodist, writing carefully shaped lines which are easy to sing and memorable. His tunes appeared in copies decades after his death and were often used as sources for mass composition by later composers. Most of his music, even his sacred music, is simple and clear in outline, sometimes even ascetic (monk-like). A greater contrast between Binchois and the extreme complexity of the &quot;ars subtilior&quot; of the prior (fourteenth) century would be hard to imagine. Most of his secular songs are rondeaux, which became the most common song form during the century. He rarely wrote in strophic form, and his melodies are generally independent of the rhyme scheme of the verses they are set to. Binchois wrote music for the court, secular songs of love and chivalry that met the expectations and satisfied the taste of the Dukes of Burgundy who employed him, and evidently loved his music accordingly. About half of his extant secular music is found in the Oxford Bodleian Library.

Guillaume Du Fay (–1474) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the early Renaissance. The central figure in the Burgundian School, he was regarded by his contemporaries as the leading composer in Europe in the mid-15th century. Du Fay composed in most of the common forms of the day, including masses, motets, Magnificats, hymns, simple chant settings in fauxbourdon, and antiphons within the area of sacred music, and rondeaux, ballades, virelais and a few other chanson types within the realm of secular music. None of his surviving music is specifically instrumental, although instruments were certainly used for some of his secular music, especially for the lower parts; all of his sacred music is vocal. Instruments may have been used to reinforce the voices in actual performance for almost any of his works. Seven complete masses, 28 individual mass movements, 15 settings of chant used in mass propers, three Magnificats, two Benedicamus Domino settings, 15 antiphon settings (six of them Marian antiphons), 27 hymns, 22 motets (13 of these isorhythmic in the more angular, austere 14th-century style which gave way to more melodic, sensuous treble-dominated part-writing with phrases ending in the &quot;under-third&quot; cadence in Du Fay&#x27;s youth) and 87 chansons definitely by him have survived.

Many of Du Fay&#x27;s compositions were simple settings of chant, obviously designed for liturgical use, probably as substitutes for the unadorned chant, and can be seen as chant harmonizations. Often the harmonization used a technique of parallel writing known as fauxbourdon, as in the following example, a setting of the Marian antiphon &quot;Ave maris stella&quot;. Du Fay may have been the first composer to use the term &quot;fauxbourdon&quot; for this simpler compositional style, prominent in 15th-century liturgical music in general and that of the Burgundian school in particular. Most of Du Fay&#x27;s secular (non-religious) songs follow the formes fixes (rondeau, ballade, and virelai), which dominated secular European music of the 14th and 15th centuries. He also wrote a handful of Italian ballate, almost certainly while he was in Italy. As is the case with his motets, many of the songs were written for specific occasions, and many are datable, thus supplying useful biographical information. Most of his songs are for three voices, using a texture dominated by the highest voice; the other two voices, unsupplied with text, were probably played by instruments.

Du Fay was one of the last composers to make use of late-medieval polyphonic structural techniques such as isorhythm, and one of the first to employ the more mellifluous harmonies, phrasing and melodies characteristic of the early Renaissance. His compositions within the larger genres (masses, motets and chansons) are mostly similar to each other; his renown is largely due to what was perceived as his perfect control of the forms in which he worked, as well as his gift for memorable and singable melody. During the 15th century, he was universally regarded as the greatest composer of his time, an opinion that has largely survived to the present day.

==Middle period (1470–1530)==
During the 16th century, Josquin des Prez ( – 27 August 1521) gradually acquired the reputation as the greatest composer of the age, his mastery of technique and expression universally imitated and admired. Writers as diverse as Baldassare Castiglione and Martin Luther wrote about his reputation and fame.

==Late period (1530–1600)==

In Venice, from about 1530 until around 1600, an impressive polychoral style developed, which gave Europe some of the grandest, most sonorous music composed up until that time, with multiple choirs of singers, brass and strings in different spatial locations in the Basilica San Marco di Venezia (see Venetian School). These multiple revolutions spread over Europe in the next several decades, beginning in Germany and then moving to Spain, France, and England somewhat later, demarcating the beginning of what we now know as the Baroque musical era.

The Roman School was a group of composers of predominantly church music in Rome, spanning the late Renaissance and early Baroque eras. Many of the composers had a direct connection to the Vatican and the papal chapel, though they worked at several churches; stylistically they are often contrasted with the Venetian School of composers, a concurrent movement which was much more progressive. By far the most famous composer of the Roman School is Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. While best known as a prolific composer of masses and motets, he was also an important madrigalist. His ability to bring together the functional needs of the Catholic Church with the prevailing musical styles during the Counter-Reformation period gave him his enduring fame.

The brief but intense flowering of the musical madrigal in England, mostly from 1588 to 1627, along with the composers who produced them, is known as the English Madrigal School. The English madrigals were a cappella, predominantly light in style, and generally began as either copies or direct translations of Italian models. Most were for three to six voices.

&quot;Musica reservata&quot; is either a style or a performance practice in a cappella vocal music of the latter half of the 16th century, mainly in Italy and southern Germany, involving refinement, exclusivity, and intense emotional expression of sung text.

The cultivation of European music in the Americas began in the 16th century soon after the arrival of the Spanish, and the conquest of Mexico. Although fashioned in European style, uniquely Mexican hybrid works based on native Mexican language and European musical practice appeared very early. Musical practices in New Spain continually coincided with European tendencies throughout the subsequent Baroque and Classical music periods. Among these New World composers were Hernando Franco, Antonio de Salazar, and Manuel de Zumaya.

In addition, writers since 1932 have observed what they call a &quot;seconda prattica&quot; (an innovative practice involving monodic style and freedom in treatment of dissonance, both justified by the expressive setting of texts) during the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

===Mannerism===
In the late 16th century, as the Renaissance era closed, an extremely manneristic style developed. In secular music, especially in the madrigal, there was a trend towards complexity and even extreme chromaticism (as exemplified in madrigals of Luzzaschi, Marenzio, and Gesualdo). The term &quot;mannerism&quot; derives from art history.

===Transition to the Baroque===

Beginning in Florence, there was an attempt to revive the dramatic and musical forms of Ancient Greece, through the means of monody, a form of declaimed music over a simple accompaniment; a more extreme contrast with the preceding polyphonic style would be hard to find; this was also, at least at the outset, a secular trend. These musicians were known as the Florentine Camerata.

We have already noted some of the musical developments that helped to usher in the Baroque, but for further explanation of this transition, see antiphon, concertato, monody, madrigal, and opera, as well as the works given under &quot;Sources and further reading.&quot;

==Instruments==
Many instruments originated during the Renaissance; others were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously. Some have survived to the present day; others have disappeared, only to be recreated in order to perform music of the period on authentic instruments. As in the modern day, instruments may be classified as brass, strings, percussion, and woodwind.

Medieval instruments in Europe had most commonly been used singly, often self-accompanied with a drone, or occasionally in parts. From at least as early as the 13th century through the 15th century there was a division of instruments into &quot;haut&quot; (loud, shrill, outdoor instruments) and &quot;bas&quot; (quieter, more intimate instruments). Only two groups of instruments could play freely in both types of ensembles: the cornett and sackbut, and the tabor and tambourine.

At the beginning of the 16th century, instruments were considered to be less important than voices. They were used for dances and to accompany vocal music. Instrumental music remained subordinated to vocal music, and much of its repertory was in varying ways derived from or dependent on vocal models.

===Organs===
Various kinds of organs were commonly used in the Renaissance, from large church organs to small portatives and reed organs called regals.

===Brass===
Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals. Some of the more common brass instruments that were played:
* Slide trumpet: Similar to the trombone of today except that instead of a section of the body sliding, only a small part of the body near the mouthpiece and the mouthpiece itself is stationary. Also, the body was an S-shape so it was rather unwieldy, but was suitable for the slow dance music which it was most commonly used for.
* Cornett: Made of wood and played like the recorder (by blowing in one end and moving the fingers up and down the outside) but using a cup mouthpiece like a trumpet.
* Trumpet: Early trumpets had no valves, and were limited to the tones present in the overtone series. They were also made in different sizes.
* Sackbut (sometimes sackbutt or sagbutt): A different name for the trombone, which replaced the slide trumpet by the middle of the 15th century.

===Strings===

As a family, strings were used in many circumstances, both sacred and secular. A few members of this family include:
* Viol: This instrument, developed in the 15th century, commonly has six strings. It was usually played with a bow. It has structural qualities similar to the Spanish plucked vihuela (called &quot;viola da mano&quot; in Italy); its main separating trait is its larger size. This changed the posture of the musician in order to rest it against the floor or between the legs in a manner similar to the cello. Its similarities to the vihuela were sharp waist-cuts, similar frets, a flat back, thin ribs, and identical tuning. When played in this fashion, it was sometimes referred to as &quot;viola da gamba&quot;, in order to distinguish it from viols played &quot;on the arm&quot;: viole da braccio, which evolved into the violin family.
* Lyre: Its construction is similar to a small harp, although instead of being plucked, it is strummed with a plectrum. Its strings varied in quantity from four, seven, and ten, depending on the era. It was played with the right hand, while the left hand silenced the notes that were not desired. Newer lyres were modified to be played with a bow.
* Irish Harp: Also called the Clàrsach in Scottish Gaelic, or the Cláirseach in Irish, during the Middle Ages it was the most popular instrument of Ireland and Scotland. Due to its significance in Irish history, it is seen even on the Guinness label and is Ireland&#x27;s national symbol even to this day. To be played it is usually plucked. Its size can vary greatly from a harp that can be played in one&#x27;s lap to a full-size harp that is placed on the floor
* Hurdy-gurdy: (Also known as the wheel fiddle), in which the strings are sounded by a wheel which the strings pass over. Its functionality can be compared to that of a mechanical violin, in that its bow (wheel) is turned by a crank. Its distinctive sound is mainly because of its &quot;drone strings&quot; which provide a constant pitch similar in their sound to that of bagpipes.
* Gittern and mandore: these instruments were used throughout Europe. Forerunners of modern instruments including the mandolin and guitar.
* Lira da braccio
* Bandora
* Cittern

===Percussion===
Some Renaissance percussion instruments include the triangle, the Jew&#x27;s harp, the tambourine, the bells, cymbals, the rumble-pot, and various kinds of drums.
* Tambourine: The tambourine is a frame drum. The skin that surrounds the frame is called the vellum and produces the beat by striking the surface with the knuckles, fingertips, or hand. It could also be played by shaking the instrument, allowing the tambourine&#x27;s jingles or pellet bells (if it has either) to &quot;clank&quot; and &quot;jingle&quot;.
* Jew&#x27;s harp: An instrument that produces sound using shapes of the mouth and attempting to pronounce different vowels with one&#x27;s mouth. The loop at the bent end of the tongue of the instrument is plucked in different scales of vibration creating different tones.

===Woodwinds (aerophones)===

Woodwind instruments (aerophones) produce sound by means of a vibrating column of air within the pipe. Holes along the pipe allow the player to control the length of the column of air, and hence the pitch. There are several ways of making the air column vibrate, which ways define the subcategories of woodwind instruments. 

A player may blow across a mouth hole, as in a transverse flute, or into a whistle mouthpiece, as in a recorder (a duct flute); into a single-reed mouthpiece, as in a modern-day clarinet or saxophone; or into a double-reed mouthpiece, as in an oboe or bassoon. All three methods of tone production can be found in Renaissance woodwinds.
* Shawm: A typical oriental shawm is keyless and is about a foot long with seven finger holes and a thumb hole. The pipes were also most commonly made of wood and many of them had carvings and decorations on them. It was the most popular double reed instrument of the Renaissance period; it was commonly used in the streets with drums and trumpets because of its brilliant, piercing, and often deafening sound. To play the shawm a person puts the entire reed in their mouth, puffs out their cheeks, and blows into the pipe whilst breathing through their nose.
* Reedpipe: Made from a single short length of cane with a mouthpiece, four or five finger holes, and reed fashioned from it. The reed is made by cutting out a small tongue, but leaving the base attached. It is the predecessor of the saxophone and the clarinet.
* Hornpipe: Same as reed pipe but with a bell at the end.
* Bagpipe/Bladderpipe: Believed by the faithful to have been invented by herdsmen who thought using a bag made out of sheep or goat skin would provide continuing air pressure so that when its player is obliged to take a breath, the player need only squeeze the bag tucked underneath their arm to continue the tone. The mouth pipe has a simple round piece of leather hinged on to the bag end of the pipe and acts like a non-return valve. The reed is located inside the long mouthpiece, which would have been known as a bocal, had it been made of metal and had the reed been on the outside instead of the inside.
* Panpipe: Employs a number of wooden tubes with a stopper at one end and open on the other. Each tube is a different size (thereby producing a different tone), giving it a range of an octave and a half. The player can then place their lips against the desired tube and blow across it.
* Transverse flute: The transverse flute is similar to the modern flute with a mouth hole near the stoppered end and finger holes along the body. The player blows across the mouth hole and holds the flute to either the right or left side.
* Recorder: The recorder was a common instrument during the Renaissance period. Rather than a reed, it uses a whistle mouthpiece as its main source of sound production. It is usually made with seven finger holes and a thumb hole.
