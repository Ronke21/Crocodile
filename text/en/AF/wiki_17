<text>Primate () is a title or rank bestowed on some important archbishops in certain Christian churches. Depending on the particular tradition, it can denote either jurisdictional authority (title of authority) or (usually) ceremonial precedence (title of honour).

==Catholic Church==

In the Latin Church, a primate is an archbishop—or, rarely, a suffragan or exempt bishop—of a specific (mostly metropolitan) episcopal see (called a &quot;primatial see&quot;) who has precedence over the bishoprics of one or more ecclesiastical provinces of a particular historical, political or cultural area. Historically, primates of particular sees were granted privileges including the authority to call and preside at national synods, jurisdiction to hear appeals from metropolitan tribunals, the right to crown the sovereign of the nation, and presiding at the investiture (installation) of archbishops in their sees.
The office is generally found only in older Catholic countries, and is now purely honorific, enjoying no effective powers under canon law—except for the archbishop of Esztergom (Gran) in Hungary. Thus, e.g., the primate of Poland holds no jurisdictional authority over other Polish bishops or their dioceses, but is &quot;durante munere&quot; a member of the standing committee of the episcopal conference, and has honorary precedence among Polish bishops (e.g., in liturgical ceremonies). The Holy See has also granted Polish primates the privilege of wearing cardinal&#x27;s crimson attire, except for the skullcap and biretta, even if they have not been made cardinals.

Where the title of primate exists, it may be vested in one of the oldest archdioceses in a country, often based in a city other than the present capital, but which was the capital when the country was first Christianized. The city may no longer have the prominence it had when the title was granted. The political area over which primacy was originally granted may no longer exist: for example, the Archbishop of Toledo was designated &quot;Primate of the Visigothic Kingdom&quot;, and the Archbishop of Lyon is the &quot;Primate of the Gauls&quot;. The title of Primate can, therefore, also be disputed between different Archdioceses who, at some point, held proeminence over a shifting territory; such is the dispute over the Primacy of the Spains that was fought over by the Archdioceses of Braga, Toledo and Santiago de Compostela. After the founding of Portugal, the Archbishop of Braga held precedence over all other archbishops in the country, though his role declined under the rise of the Archdiocese of Lisbon, which culminated in 1716, when Archbishop Tomás de Almeida (1670–1754) was elevated to Patriarch.

Some of the leadership functions once exercised by Primates, specifically presiding at meetings of the bishops of a nation or region, are now exercised by the president of the conference of bishops: &quot;The president of the Conference or, when he is lawfully impeded, the vice-president, presides not only over the general meetings of the Conference but also over the permanent committee.&quot; The president is generally elected by the conference, but by exception the President of the Italian Episcopal Conference is appointed by the Pope, and the Irish Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference has the Primate of All Ireland as president and the Primate of Ireland as vice-president. Other former functions of primates, such as hearing appeals from metropolitan tribunals, were reserved to the Holy See by the early 20th century. Soon after, by the norm of the Code of Canon Law of 1917, confirmed in the 1983 Code, the tribunal of second instance for appeals from a metropolitan tribunal is &quot;the tribunal which the metropolitan has designated in a stable manner with the approval of the Apostolic See&quot;.

The closest equivalent position in the Eastern Churches in 1911 was an Exarch.

The Holy See has continued in modern times to grant the title of Primate. With the papal decree &quot;Sollicitae Romanis Pontificibus&quot; of 24 January 1956 it granted the title of Primate of Canada to the Archbishop of Quebec. As stated above, this is merely an honorary title involving no additional power.

A right of precedence over other bishops and similar privileges can be granted even to a bishop who is not a Primate. Thus, in 1858, the Holy See granted the Archbishop of Baltimore precedence in meetings of the United States bishops. The Archbishop of Westminster has not been granted the title of Primate of England and Wales, which is sometimes applied to him, but his position has been described as that of &quot;Chief Metropolitan&quot; and as &quot;similar to&quot; that of the Archbishop of Canterbury.

The title of Primate is sometimes applied loosely to the Archbishop of a country&#x27;s capital, as in the case of the Archbishops of Seoul in South Korea and of Edinburgh in Scotland.

The pre-reformation metropolitan Archbishop of Nidaros was sometimes referred to as Primate of Norway, even though it is unlikely that this title ever was officially granted to him by the Holy See.

===Regular clergy equivalent===
In the modern confederation of the Benedictine Order, all the Black Monks of St. Benedict were united under the presidency of an Abbot Primate (Leo XIII, &quot;Summum semper&quot;, 12 July 1893); but the unification, fraternal in its nature, brought no modification to the abbatial dignity, and the various congregations preserved their autonomy intact. The loose structure of the Benedictine Confederation is claimed to have made Pope Leo XIII exclaim that the Benedictines were &quot;ordo sine ordine&quot; (&quot;an order without order&quot;). The powers of the Abbot Primate are specified, and his position defined, in a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops and Regulars dated 16 September 1893. The primacy is attached to the global Benedictine Confederation whose Primate resides at Sant&#x27;Anselmo in Rome. He takes precedence of all other abbots, is empowered to pronounce on all doubtful matters of discipline, to settle difficulties arising between monasteries, to hold a canonical visitation, if necessary, in any congregation of the order, and to exercise a general supervision for the regular observance of monastic discipline. The Primatial powers are only vested in the Abbot Primate to act by virtue of the proper law of its autonomous Benedictine congregation, which at the present is minimal to none. However, certain branches of the Benedictine Order seem to have lost their original autonomy to some extent.
In a similar way the Confederation of Canons Regular of St. Augustine, elects an Abbot Primate as figurehead of the Confederation and indeed the whole Canonical Order. The Abbots and Superiors General of the nine congregations of confederated congregations of Canons Regular elect a new Abbot Primate for a term of office lasting six years. The Current Abbot Primate is Rt Rev. Fr Jean-Michel Girard, CRB, Abbot General of the Canons Regular of the Grand St Bernard.

== Anglicanism ==
Anglican usage styles the bishop who heads an independent church as its &quot;primate&quot;, though commonly they hold some other title (e.g. archbishop, presiding bishop, or moderator). The primates&#x27; authority within their churches varies considerably: some churches give the primate some executive authority, while in others they may do no more than preside over church councils and represent the church ceremonially.

===Anglican Communion===

In the context of the Anglican Communion Primates&#x27; Meeting, the chief bishop of each of the thirty-nine churches (also known as provinces) that compose the Anglican Communion acts as its primate, though this title may not necessarily be used within their own provinces. Thus the United Churches of Bangladesh, of North India, of Pakistan and of South India, which are united with other originally non-Anglican churches, are represented at the meetings by their moderators.

In both the Church of England and the Church of Ireland, two bishops have the title of primate: the archbishops of Canterbury and York in England and of Armagh and Dublin in Ireland. Only the bishop of the senior primatial see of each of these two churches participates in the meetings.

The archbishop of Canterbury, who is considered &quot;primus inter pares&quot; of all the participants, convokes the meetings and issues the invitations.

Primates and archbishops are styled &quot;The Most Reverend&quot;. All other bishops are styled &quot;The Right Reverend&quot;, with the exception of the Bishop of Meath and Kildare in the Church of Ireland.

==Eastern Orthodox equivalent==
Historically, the primatial title in Western Christianity corresponded to the title and office of supra-metropolitan exarch in Eastern Christianity. Such exarchs, or primates, were archbishops of Ephesus (for the Diocese of Asia), Heraclea (for the Diocese of Thrace) and Caesarea (for the Diocese of Pontus).

<text>Penny Arcade is a webcomic focused on video games and video game culture, written by Jerry Holkins and illustrated by Mike Krahulik. The comic debuted in 1998 on the website &quot;loonygames.com&quot;. Since then, Holkins and Krahulik have established their own site, which is typically updated with a new comic strip each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The comics are accompanied by regular updates on the site&#x27;s blog.

By 2005, &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; was among the most popular and longest running webcomics online, listed in 2010 as having 3.5 million readers. Holkins and Krahulik were among the first webcomic creators successful enough to make a living from their work. In addition to the comic, Holkins and Krahulik also created Child&#x27;s Play, a children&#x27;s charity; PAX, a gaming convention; Penny Arcade TV, a YouTube channel; Pinny Arcade, a pin exchange; and the episodic video game &quot;Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness&quot; with Hothead Games and Zeboyd Games.

==Overview==

The strip features Krahulik and Holkins&#x27; cartoon alter egos, John &quot;Gabe&quot; Gabriel and Tycho Brahe, respectively. While often borrowing from the authors&#x27; experiences, Holkins and Krahulik do not treat them as literal avatars or caricatures of themselves. The two characters spend much of their time playing and commenting on both computer and video games, which forms the basis of the humor in the strip. Most of the time Gabe serves the purpose of the comic and Tycho the comic foil. The strip can feature in-jokes that are explained in the news posts accompanying each comic, written by the authors.

Both Krahulik and Holkins make a living from &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;, placing them in a small group of professional webcomic artists devoted to their creations full-time. Originally, like many webcomics, &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; was supported solely by donations. A graph on the main page indicated how much people had donated that month. After hiring Robert Khoo as their business manager, Holkins and Krahulik switched to a different income stream based on advertising and merchandise revenue alone. According to Holkins, the website handled more than two million pageviews daily (excluding forum traffic) in 2006. On November 13, 2005, the website was redesigned in celebration of their seventh year running and to match the designs of the Child&#x27;s Play Charity and Penny Arcade Expo websites. Afterwards, the site has been redesigned multiple times.

==Attributes of the comic strip==
As a (primarily) topical video gaming news comic, there is little plot or general continuity in &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; strips. Any story sustained for longer than a single strip is referred to as &quot;dreaded continuity&quot;, something of a running gag in the newsposts. A character who dies a violent death in one strip will come back in the next, perfectly whole, though occasionally these deaths have an effect on later comics. For example, often, when Gabe kills Tycho or vice versa, the killer takes a certain Pac-Man watch off the dead character, but only if he currently has the watch. Profanity and violence are common in &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; and the strip is known for its surrealism; zombies, a talking alcoholic DIVX player called Div, Santa Claus, a robotic juicer called the &quot;Fruit Fucker 2000&quot;, and Jesus, among others, are known to drop in often and for petty reasons. Other such occurrences are implied, if not shown, such as mentioning Dante from &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; living in the building next door. However, the comic does occasionally expand into more serious issues; one even had Krahulik, in the guise of the character Gabe, proposing to his girlfriend of two years, while another had both Gabe and Tycho praising Casey Heynes for standing up to bullying.

Some of the strips are drawn from the perspective of fictional characters within a game or movie. Occasionally, Gabe and Tycho are featured as they would be as characters or players in the game themselves, often having some sarcastic remark to make about some feature or bug in the game. At times the comic also depicts meetings between game developers or business people, and features or mocks the reporters of a news article that is commented on in Holkins&#x27; newspost.

&quot;Penny Arcade&quot; has a theme song, &quot;Penny Arcade Theme&quot;, written and performed by nerdcore artist MC Frontalot. It was written as a thank-you by Frontalot for the creators of the webcomic linking his website to their and declaring him their &quot;rapper laureate&quot; in 2002. The song appears in the dance game &quot;In the Groove&quot;, released in 2004.

==Protagonists==
===Jonathan &quot;Gabe&quot; Gabriel===
Mike Krahulik&#x27;s comic alter ego is energetic and free-spirited, but has a propensity to become extremely angry. As a contrast to Tycho&#x27;s expansive vocabulary, Gabe usually speaks using only simple, common words. He almost always wears a yellow Pac-Man shirt, and has a Pac-Man tattoo on his right arm. His eyes are a shade of slate blue. 

He has a fascination with unicorns, a secret love of Barbies, is a dedicated fan of Spider-Man and &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and has proclaimed &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Girl&quot; to be the greatest song of all time. He has a wife and son. Gabe is a diabetic, though he continues to consume large quantities of sugar products. 

Krahulik named his son &quot;Gabriel&quot; in honor of the character.
===Tycho Brahe===
Jerry Holkins&#x27; comic alter ego (named after the astronomer Tycho Brahe) is bitter and sarcastic. His eyes are burnt sienna, and he&#x27;s almost invariably clad in a blue-striped sweater. Tycho enjoys books, role-playing video games, using large and uncommon words in conversation, and deflating Gabe&#x27;s ego. He is an enthusiastic fan of &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He also plays &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; often (the website&#x27;s previous banner illustrated him holding a 20-sided die), and adopts a wildly theatrical style when acting as a dungeon master.

Tycho occasionally makes reference to his scarring childhood, during which his mother physically abused him. Tycho also has a drinking problem.

In &quot;Poker Night at the Inventory&quot;, Tycho is voiced by Kid Beyond.

==Podcast==
Krahulik and Holkins began to record and release audio content on March 20, 2006, titled &quot;Downloadable Content.&quot; The podcasts specifically captured the creative process that goes into the creation of a &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; comic, usually starting with a perusal of recent gaming news, with conversational tangents and digressions to follow. As well as being a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;, Krahulik and Holkins discussed possible subjects for the comic.

The format of the show was mostly &quot;fly-on-the-wall&quot; style, in that the hosts rarely acknowledged the existence of the microphone. There was no theme music, intro, or outro. The podcasts were of varying lengths, beginning abruptly and ending with the idea for the current comic. New episodes were released irregularly, with six month gaps not uncommon.

Although the shows were initially published weekly, Holkins stated in a May 2006 blog post that they found difficulties when trying to produce the podcasts on a regular basis. The duo planned to keep recording podcasts occasionally.

Since airing the first episode of the new PATV in February 2010, the podcast has not been updated. A new segment has since appeared on PATV called &quot;The Fourth Panel,&quot; which presents a fly-on-the-wall look at comics creation much as the podcast did.

On May 8, 2013 Penny Arcade launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the continuation of &quot;Downloadable Content&quot;. The kickstarter was successful, with new Podcasts being added each Wednesday. &quot;Downloadable Content&quot; is &quot;currently on hiatus,&quot; with the latest episode dated August 23, 2018.

==Games==
&quot;Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness&quot; is an episodic video game based on the strip. The first two episodes were developed by Hothead Games, and were built on a version of the Torque Game Engine. The first episode was released worldwide on May 21, 2008, and the second on October 29, 2008. They were self-published via the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live as well as the PlayGreenhouse.com service created by &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; to distribute independent games. The game features many elements of the &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; universe in a 1920s steampunk setting. In 2010, Krahulik and Holkins announced that the remainder of the series had been cancelled, to allow Hothead to focus on other projects. At PAX Prime 2011, however, it was announced that the series would be revived and developed by Zeboyd Games, with a retro style similar to Zeboyd&#x27;s past titles. The third episode was released on Steam and on Penny Arcade&#x27;s web store June 25, 2012. The fourth and final episode was announced in January 2013, and released to Steam and Xbox Live in June 2013.

A teaser trailer released by Telltale Games on August 28, 2010, revealed that Tycho would appear in an upcoming game alongside &quot;Team Fortress 2&#x27;s&quot; Heavy, &quot;Homestar Runner&#x27;s&quot; Strong Bad and &quot;Sam &amp; Max&#x27;s&quot; Max. The game, called &quot;Poker Night at the Inventory&quot;, was officially revealed on September 2, 2010.

&quot;The Last Christmas&quot; and &quot;The Hawk and the Hare&quot;, two stories that were published on the site, were released as motion comics for iOS developed by SRRN Games.

The North American release of &quot;Tekken 6&quot; has a skin for Yoshimitsu based on the Cardboard Tube Samurai. An official DLC skin pack was released for Dungeon Defenders featuring Tycho, Cardboard Tube Samurai Gabe, Annarchy and Jim Darkmagic skins.

Cryptozoic Entertainment released the licensed deck-building card game &quot;Penny Arcade The Game: Gamers Vs. Evil&quot; in 2011, and followed it with the expansion pack &quot;Penny Arcade The Game: Rumble in R&#x27;lyeh&quot; in 2012. Playdek released a digital conversion of &quot;Penny Arcade The Game: Gamers Vs. Evil&quot; for iOS in 2012.

==&quot;Penny Arcade: The Series&quot;==
&quot;Penny Arcade: The Series&quot; first aired online on February 20, 2010. It is a multi-season documentary series based on the exploits of the Penny Arcade company and its founders Krahulik and Holkins. The last episode of the series was posted in September 2015.

==Other works==
===Penny Arcade Presents===
Under the banner of &quot;Penny Arcade Presents&quot;, Krahulik and Holkins are sometimes commissioned to create promotional artwork/comic strips for new video games, with their signature artistic style and humor. They are usually credited simply as &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; rather than by their actual names. Some of these works have been included with the distribution of the game, and others have appeared on pre-launch official websites. An official list could be found on the Penny Arcade website. The last of these commissions was posted in 2012.

=== Collectible Card Game ===
On August 8, 2005, Krahulik announced that &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;, in partnership with Sabertooth Games, would be producing a collectible card game based on the &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; franchise. The resulting &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; &quot;battle box&quot; was released in February 2006 as part of the Universal Fighting System.

There are also a few spinoffs from the main comic that have gained independent existences. An example is &quot;Epic Legends Of The Hierarchs: The Elemenstor Saga&quot; (ELotH:TES), a parody of the written-by-committee fantasy fiction used as back-story for a wide variety of games: originally a one-off gag in the &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; comic, in late 2005 this was expanded into a complete fantasy universe, documented on a hoax &quot;fan-wiki&quot;. ELotH:TES first appeared in the webcomic of February 7, 2005, and has subsequently been featured in the comics of November 7, 2005 and November 30, 2005. Several elements of the ELotH:TES universe are featured on the cover of their second comics collection, &quot;Epic Legends of the Magic Sword Kings&quot;.

=== ESRB ad campaigns ===
On May 31, 2006 Krahulik announced a new advertising campaign for the Entertainment Software Rating Board. According to Krahulik, the ESRB &quot;wanted a campaign that would communicate to gamers why the ESRB is important even if they don&#x27;t think it directly affects them.&quot; Among the reasons he listed for &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;&#x27;s accepting the job was that he and Holkins are both fathers and are concerned about the games their children might play. The ad campaign was rolled out in the summer and fall of 2006 and a second campaign was released in 2012 featuring a mother, a father and a gamer describing the tools employed by the ESRB.

===&quot;The New Kid&quot; film===
Announced on June 2, 2011, Paramount Pictures had acquired the rights to produce an animated film, via Paramount Animation to make this, of the one-off strip &quot;The New Kid&quot; which was published on October 29, 2010. The strip was one of three mini-strips which featured a cinematic opening to a larger story left unexplored. &quot;The New Kid&quot; is about a boy who&#x27;s moving to a new planet with his family because of his father&#x27;s career. The script was written by Gary Whitta and would have been produced by Mary Parent and Cale Boyter.

At PAX Australia in 2016, during a Q&amp;A session, Holkins revealed that changes at Paramount resulted in the movie rights being returned to Penny Arcade and the project canceled. He did note, however, that Whitta&#x27;s script was complete and the project could move forward with another production company in the future.

===The Trenches===
The Trenches was a comic series by Krahulik and Holkins in collaboration with webcomic &quot;PvP&quot;&#x27;s creator Scott Kurtz. The comic followed a man named Issac and his life as a game tester. The series was launched on August 9, 2011 and featured new strips every Tuesday and Thursday, usually accompanied by a &quot;Tale from the Trenches&quot;, which was a short piece submitted by a reader detailing their own experiences in the game industry.

In September 2012, Kurtz stopped illustrating the webcomic, due to lack of time, and was replaced by Mary Cagle, a former intern of his, and the creator of the webcomic Kiwi Blitz. Kurtz still continued to collaborate with Krahulik and Holkins in writing the comic. In late August 2013, illustration was taken over by Ty Halley (&quot;Secret Life of a Journal Writer&quot;) and Monica Ray (&quot;Phuzzy Comics&quot;), former contestants of the Penny Arcade series &quot;Strip Search&quot;.

&quot;The Trenches&quot; was ultimately abandoned. The last comic was posted January 5, 2016, while the last &quot;Tales&quot; is from September 10, 2015.

===The Decideotron===
In 2011, Krahulik and Holkins released an application for iOS devices called &quot;The Decide-o-tron&quot;, presented by Eedar and developed by The Binary Mill. The app worked as a recommendation engine for video games; users would input games they&#x27;d enjoyed and the app attempted to predict their ratings of titles they had not yet played. Holkins described it as &quot;Pandora for games&quot;. By 2014, the decideotron.com website was dead.

===Kickstarter===
Penny Arcade has created two Kickstarter projects. The first was the &quot;Penny Arcade&#x27;s Paint the Line&quot; card game which was used as an alternative to pre-ordering it and came with an exclusive comic. The second was entitled &quot;Penny Arcade Sells Out&quot; and was intended to replace advertising revenue with crowd funding. The leaderboard ad on the home page of Penny Arcade would be removed if the minimum goal of $250,000 were reached, whereas the entire site would become completely ad-free for a year at $999,999. The reality web series described as &quot;our version of America&#x27;s Next Top Webcomic&quot; titled &quot;Strip Search&quot; arose from the $450,000 stretch goal.

Krahulik and Holkins created a comic strip which compares the 7th generation consoles that appears in the December 2006 issue of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine.

==&quot;Penny Arcade&quot; events==

Every Christmas since 2003, &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; hosts a charity called Child&#x27;s Play to buy new toys for children&#x27;s hospitals. They have also sponsored a three-day gaming festival called the Penny Arcade Expo, later renamed to PAX, every August since 2004.

==Legal issues and controversy==
===Strawberry Shortcake===
Krahulik and Holkins received a cease-and-desist letter from American Greetings Corporation over the use of American Greetings&#x27; Strawberry Shortcake and Plum Puddin&#x27; characters in the April 14, 2003 &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; strip entitled &quot;Tart as a Double Entendre&quot;.

The duo chose not to enter into a legal battle over whether or not the strip was a protected form of parody, and they complied with the cease-and-desist by replacing it with an image directing their audience to send a letter to a lawyer for American Greetings. They later lampooned the incident by portraying an American Greetings employee as a Nazi.

===Jack Thompson===
On October 17, 2005 Krahulik and Holkins donated US$10,000 to the Entertainment Software Association foundation in the name of Jack Thompson, a disbarred attorney and activist against violence in video games. Earlier, Thompson himself had promised to donate $10,000 if a video game was created in which the player kills video game developers (&quot;A Modest Video Game Proposal&quot;), but after a mod to the game &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; was pointed out to already exist, Thompson called his challenge satire (referring to the title of the letter as a reference to &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot;) and refused to donate the money. He claimed these games were not going to be manufactured, distributed, or sold like retail games, as his Modest Proposal stated, and therefore, the deal went unfulfilled. His refusal was met with disdain, given that multiple games were created or in the process of being created under Thompson&#x27;s criteria. Krahulik and Holkins donated the money in his place, with a check containing the memo: &quot;For Jack Thompson, Because Jack Thompson Won&#x27;t&quot;.

Thompson proceeded to phone Krahulik, as related by Holkins in the corresponding news post.

On October 18, 2005 it was reported that Jack Thompson had faxed a letter to Seattle Police Chief Gil Kerlikowske claiming that &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; &quot;employs certain personnel who have decided to commence and orchestrate criminal harassment of me by various means&quot;. Holkins defended the site by saying that the &quot;harassment&quot; Thompson referred to was simply &quot;the natural result of a public figure making statements that people disagree with, and letting him know their thoughts on the matter via his publicly available contact information&quot;.

On October 21, 2005 Thompson claimed to have sent a letter to John McKay, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington, in an attempt to get the FBI involved. Thompson re-iterated his claims of &quot;extortion&quot; and accused &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; of using &quot;their Internet site and various other means to encourage and solicit criminal harassment&quot;. Penny Arcade denied the charge of &quot;extortion&quot;, noting that they paid the $10,000 to charity, and asked nothing in return.

Thompson claimed the harassment of him is a direct result of Mike Krahulik&#x27;s posts, which listed links to the Florida Bar Association. Thompson accused &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; of soliciting complaints to the Bar against him, even though Krahulik actually posted the opposite, asking fans to cease sending letters to the Bar, as the Bar acknowledged that it is aware of Thompson&#x27;s actions, thanks to previous letters.

The Seattle PD eventually acknowledged receiving a complaint from Thompson, but have commented that they believe the issue to be a civil, rather than criminal, matter. They noted that this was from initial impressions of the letter they received, and their criminal investigations bureau is reviewing the letter to make sure that there were not any criminal matters that they missed.

On the same day, Scott Kurtz, creator of the webcomic &quot;PvP&quot; and a longtime friend of Krahulik and Holkins, used the image of the letter Thompson sent to the Seattle PD to create a parody letter in which Jack attempts to enlist the aid of the Justice League of America by claiming Gabe and Tycho to be villains of some description.

The &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; shop had at the time sold an &quot;I hate Jack Thompson&quot; T-shirt, claiming that every living creature, including Thompson&#x27;s own mother, hates Jack Thompson.

On March 21, 2007 Thompson filed a countersuit to the lawsuit brought against him by Take Two Interactive claiming that they are at the center of a RICO conspiracy. &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; was named as one of the co-conspirators. At Sakura-Con 2007, Krahulik announced that the suit had been dropped.
===Dickwolves controversy===
In an August 11, 2010 comic entitled &quot;The Sixth Slave&quot;, an NPC pleads with a player who then refuses to save him: &quot;Every morning, we are roused by savage blows. Every night, we are raped to sleep by the dickwolves&quot;. The strip drew criticism from many commentators, including from &quot;The American Prospect&quot; and &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot;. Krahulik and Holkins dismissed these criticisms, later selling &quot;Team Dickwolves&quot; T-shirts based on the strip. They later removed the &quot;Team Dickwolves&quot; shirt from their store due to complaints that it made potential PAX attendees uncomfortable. After the removal, Krahulik posted online that removing the shirts was only partly caving to pressure but mainly due to people who had personally emailed him and were reasonable with their concerns. Krahulik also stated that anyone still hesitant about going to PAX even after removal of the shirts should not come to PAX. In September 2013, on the last day of PAX, Krahulik told a panel that he thought that &quot;pulling the dickwolves merchandise was a mistake&quot;, to cheers from the crowd. However, Krahulik later apologized on the &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; website, stating that he regretted contributing to the furor that had followed the original comic. Both critics of the comic strip and Krahulik and Holkins, made claims of receiving verbal abuse through social media and death threats.

In a 2012 article in the &quot;Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media&quot;, academics Salter &amp; Blodgett used the Dickwolves incident as a case study into &quot;hypermasculinity and sexism within the gaming community&quot;, and argued that &quot;this case highlights how the hypermasculine discourse encourages the overt privileging of masculinity over femininity and discourages women from engaging in gendered discourse within the community.&quot;

==&quot;Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory&quot;==

&quot;John Gabriel&#x27;s Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory&quot; was posted in the &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; strip published March 19, 2004. It regards the online disinhibition effect, in which Internet users exhibit unsociable tendencies while interacting with other Internet users. Krahulik and Holkins suggest that, given both anonymity and an audience, an otherwise regular person becomes aggressively antisocial. In 2013, Holkins gave the corollary that &quot;Normal Person - &quot;Consequences&quot; + Audience = Total Fuckwad&quot;.

Clay Shirky, an adjunct professor at New York University who studies social and economic effects of Internet technologies, explains: &quot;There’s a large crowd and you can act out in front of it without paying any personal price to your reputation,” which &quot;creates conditions most likely to draw out the typical Internet user’s worst impulses.&quot; In an &quot;Advocate&quot; article about online homophobia, this theory was used to account for behavior on online forums where one can remain anonymous in front of an audience: for instance, posting comments on popular YouTube videos.

==Reception==
On December 13, 2006, &quot;Next Generation Magazine&quot; rated Krahulik and Holkins among its &quot;Top 25 People of the Year&quot;. Also appearing on the list were Nintendo of America President Reggie Fils-Aimé and former Xbox corporate vice-president Peter Moore. Krahulik made a post about the honor, in which he explained that &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; was created only because Next Gen rejected the duo&#x27;s entry to a comic contest many years before. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; listed &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; on their &quot;100 Sites to Bookmark Now,&quot; calling it &quot;a hilarious and smart webcomic for gamers.&quot; MTV Online named Holkins and Krahulik two of the world&#x27;s most influential gamers, saying &quot;they have become the closest the medium has to leaders of a gamers&#x27; movement.&quot; Time.com named &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; as one of its &quot;50 Best Websites&quot; for 2008 &quot;...for the way it pokes fun at the high-tech industry and the people who love it.&quot;
1UP.com described it as &quot;the One True Gaming Webcomic.&quot; &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; was used along with &quot;American Elf&quot;, &quot;Fetus-X&quot;, and &quot;Questionable Content&quot; as an example of comics using the web to create &quot;an explosion of diverse genres and styles&quot; in Scott McCloud&#x27;s 2006 book &quot;Making Comics&quot;.

==Awards and recognition==
On March 5, 2009, the Washington State Senate honored Holkins and Krahulik, both originally from Spokane, for the contribution that they had made to the state, the video game industry, and to children&#x27;s charities from around the world courtesy of their Child&#x27;s Play initiative. Later in March, &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; won the category &quot;Best Webcomic&quot; in the fan voted Project Fanboy Awards for 2008.

In 2010, Holkins, Krahulik, and Khoo were awarded the annual &quot;Ambassador Award&quot; at GDC&#x27;s Game Developers Choice Awards for contributions they had made to the industry. The same year, &quot;Time&quot; included Holkins and Krahulik in the annual &quot;Time 100&quot;, the magazine&#x27;s listing of the world&#x27;s 100 most influential people.

In July 2015, Holkins and Krahulik were recognized as &quot;Multimedia Empire Builders&quot; in Ad Week&#x27;s 10 Visual Artists Changing the Way We See Advertising issue.

<doc id="24676" wikidata="Q213702" url="?curid=24676" title="President of Ireland">
<text>The president of Ireland () is the head of state of Ireland and the supreme commander of the Irish Defence Forces. The presidency is a predominantly ceremonial institution, serving as the representative of the Irish state both at home and abroad. Nevertheless, the office of president is endowed with certain reserve powers which have constitutional importance. When invoking these powers, the president acts as the guardian of the Irish constitution. This representative and moderating role is in keeping with the president&#x27;s solemn oath to &quot;...maintain the Constitution of Ireland and uphold its laws..&quot;, to &quot;...fulfil my duties faithfully and conscientiously in accordance with the Constitution and the law...&quot;, and to &quot;...dedicate my abilities to the service and welfare of the people of Ireland.&quot; The president&#x27;s official residence and principal workplace is in Phoenix Park, Dublin.

Presidents hold office for seven years, and can be elected for a maximum of two terms. The president is elected directly by the people, although there is no poll if only one candidate is nominated, which has occurred on six occasions, most recently in 2004. The office was established by the Constitution of Ireland in 1937. The first president assumed office in 1938, and became recognised internationally as head of state in 1949 after the coming into effect of the Republic of Ireland Act. The current president is Michael D. Higgins, who was first elected on 29 October 2011, and inaugurated on 11 November 2011. He was re-elected for a second term on 26 October 2018.

==Ordinary duties and functions==
The Constitution of Ireland provides for a parliamentary system of government, by which the role of the head of state is largely a ceremonial one. The president is formally one of three parts of the Oireachtas (national parliament), which also comprises Dáil Éireann (the Assembly of Ireland or lower house) and Seanad Éireann (the Senate of Ireland or upper house).

Unlike most parliamentary republics, the president is not designated as the &quot;nominal&quot; chief executive. Rather, executive authority in Ireland is expressly vested in the government (cabinet). The government is obliged, however, to keep the president generally informed on matters of policy both foreign and domestic. Most of the functions of the president may be performed only in accordance with the strict instructions of the Constitution, or the binding &quot;advice&quot; of the government. The president does, however, possess certain personal powers that may be exercised discretionally.

===Constitutional functions===
The main functions as prescribed by the Constitution:
;Appoints the government: The president formally appoints the taoiseach (that is, Ireland&#x27;s head of government) and other ministers, and accepts their resignations. The taoiseach is appointed upon the nomination of the Dáil, and the president is required to appoint whomever the Dáil designates without the right to refuse appointment. All other ministers are appointed upon the nomination of the taoiseach and approval of the Dáil; as with appointing the taoiseach, the president is required to make the appointment without the right to appoint someone else. The taoiseach and ministers altogether comprise the Government, Ireland&#x27;s central executive authority. Ministers are dismissed by the advice of the taoiseach and the taoiseach must, unless there is a dissolution of the Dáil, resign upon losing the confidence of the house.
;Appoints the judiciary: The president appoints the judges to all courts in Ireland, on the advice of the Government.
;Convenes and dissolves the Dáil:This power is exercised on the advice of the taoiseach; Government or Dáil approval is not needed. The president may only refuse a dissolution when a taoiseach has lost the confidence of the Dáil.
;Signs bills into law: A ceremonial duty, as the president cannot veto a bill that the Dáil and the Seanad have duly adopted. However, the president may refer it to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. If the Supreme Court upholds the bill, the president is obliged to sign it. If, however, it is found to be unconstitutional, the president may refuse to give assent.
;Represents the state in foreign affairs: This power is exercised only by the advice of the Government. The president accredits ambassadors and receives the letters of credence of foreign diplomats. Ministers sign international treaties in the president&#x27;s name. This role was not exercised by the president prior to the Republic of Ireland Act 1948.
;Serves as Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces: Supreme command and control over the Defence Forces vests in the president. This role is similar in status to that of a commander-in-chief. An officer&#x27;s commission is signed and sealed by the president. This is a nominal function, the powers of which are exercised by the advice of the Government. (See Minister for Defence.)
;Exercises the power of clemency: The president has &quot;the right of pardon and the power to commute or remit punishment&quot;. Pardon, for miscarriages of justice, has applied rarely: Thomas Quinn in 1940, Brady in 1943, and Nicky Kelly in 1992. The current procedure is specified by Section 7 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1993. There were plans in 2005 for paramilitary fugitives to receive pardons as part of the Northern Ireland peace process, to supplement the 1998 early release of serving prisoners after the Good Friday Agreement. This was controversial and was soon abandoned along with similar British proposals. Power of commutation and remittance are not restricted to the president, though this was the case for death sentences handed down prior to the abolition of capital punishment.

===Statutory functions===
;Appoints certain state officials: The president appoints, on the advice of the government, the Senior Professors and chairman of the council of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies; the governor of the Central Bank of Ireland; the members of the Irish Financial Services Appeals Tribunal; the Ombudsman; and the members of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.
;Appoints Chester Beatty Library trustee: The president appoints one trustee to the Chester Beatty Library. This was specified in Chester Beatty&#x27;s will and given effect by a 1968 Act of the Oireachtas.
;Presides over Irish Red Cross Society: The president is &quot;ex officio&quot; president of the Irish Red Cross Society.
;Acts as Patron of Gaisce - The President&#x27;s Award: The president is &quot;ex officio&quot; patron of Gaisce – The President&#x27;s Award, established by trust deed in 1985.

===Civic functions===
;Acts as Patron of Clans of Ireland: The president is &quot;ex officio&quot; patron of Clans of Ireland, including its Order of Merit, since he so agreed in January 2012.
;Awards the dignity of Saoi for life: The president confers the title of Saoi for life on those so elected from among the existing membership of Aosdána, a state-supported association of Irish creative artists. The title is the highest honour bestowed by the organization. There are at most seven living Saoithe at any time; a limit increased from five in 2007–08.
;Supports various charities: The president serves as a patron to myriad charities in Ireland. The charities ultimately supported vary from president to president and are in keeping with the president&#x27;s vision and theme for their presidency.

===Special limitations===
*The president may not leave the state without the consent of the government.
*Every formal address or message &quot;to the nation&quot; or to either or both Houses of the Oireachtas must have prior approval of the government. Other than on these two (quite rare) occasions, there is no limitation on the president&#x27;s right to speak. While earlier presidents were exceptionally cautious in delivering speeches and on almost every occasion submitted them for vetting, Mary Robinson and Mary McAleese made much more use of their right to speak without government approval, with McAleese doing many live television and radio interviews. Nonetheless, by convention presidents refrain from direct criticism and commentary of the government.

==Reserve powers==

===Powers exercised in absolute discretion===
The president possesses the following powers exercised &quot;in his absolute discretion&quot; according to the English version of the Constitution. The Irish version states that these powers are exercised &quot;as a chomhairle féin&quot; which is usually translated as &quot;under his own counsel&quot;. Lawyers have suggested that a conflict may exist in this case between the two versions of the constitution. In the event of a clash between the Irish and English versions of the constitution, the Irish one is given supremacy. While &quot;absolute discretion&quot; appears to leave some freedom for manoeuvre for a president in deciding whether to initiate contact with the opposition, &quot;own counsel&quot; has been interpreted by some lawyers as suggesting that &quot;no&quot; contact whatsoever can take place. As a result, it is considered controversial for the president to be contacted by the leaders of any political parties in an effort to influence a decision made using the discretionary powers.

====Refusal of a Dáil dissolution====
A taoiseach who has &quot;ceased to retain the support of a majority in Dáil Eireann&quot; is required to resign, unless the taoiseach asks the president to dissolve the Dáil. The president has the right to refuse such a request, in which case the taoiseach must resign immediately. This power has never been invoked. However, the necessary circumstances existed in 1944, 1982 and 1994. The apparent discrepancy, referred to above, between the Irish and English versions of the Constitution has discouraged presidents from contemplating the use of the power. On the three occasions when the necessary circumstances existed, presidents have adopted an ultra-strict policy of non-contact with the opposition. The most notable instance of this was in January 1982, when Patrick Hillery instructed an aide, Captain Anthony Barber, to ensure that no telephone calls from the opposition were to be passed on to him. Nevertheless, three opposition figures, including Fianna Fáil leader Charles Haughey, demanded to be connected to Hillery, with Haughey threatening to end Barber&#x27;s career if the calls weren&#x27;t put through. Hillery, as Supreme Commander of the Defence Forces, recorded the threat in Barber&#x27;s military personnel file and recorded that Barber had been acting on his instructions in refusing the call. Even without this consideration, refusing such a request would arguably create a constitutional crisis, as it is considered a fairly strong constitutional convention that the head of state always grants a parliamentary dissolution.

====Appointment of members of the Council of State====

The president appoints up to seven members of the Council of State, and may remove or replace such appointed members at their discretion.

===Powers exercised after consultation with the Council of State===
It is required that, before exercising certain reserve powers, the president consult the Council of State. However, the president is not compelled to act in accordance with the Council&#x27;s advice. Indeed, the president may act contrary to its advice.

====Refer bills to the Supreme Court====
The president may refer a bill, in whole or part, to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. If the Supreme Court finds any referred part unconstitutional, the entire bill falls. This power may not be applied to a money bill, a bill to amend the Constitution, or an urgent bill the time for the consideration of which has been abridged in the Seanad. This is the most widely used reserve power; a full list is at Council of State (Ireland)#Referring of bills. In a 1982 judgment delivered under such a referral, Chief Justice Tom O&#x27;Higgins bemoaned the crude strictures of the prescribed process; especially the fact that, if the court finds that a bill does not violate the Constitution, this judgment can never subsequently be challenged.

====Refer bills to the people====

If requested to do so by a petition signed by a majority of the membership of the Seanad and one-third of the membership of the Dáil, the president may, after consultation with the Council of State, decline to sign into law a bill (other than a bill to amend the constitution) they consider to be of great &quot;national importance&quot; until it has been approved by either the people in a referendum or the Dáil reassembling after a general election, held within eighteen months. This power has never been used, and no such petition has been invoked. Of the 60 senators, 11 are nominated by the Taoiseach, so there is rarely a majority opposed to a government bill.

====Abridge time for consideration of bills in the Seanad====
The president may, at the request of the Dáil, impose a time-limit on the period during which the Seanad may consider a bill. The effect of this power is to restrict the power of the Seanad to delay a bill that the government considers urgent.

====Appoint a Committee of Privileges====
The president may, if requested to do so by the Seanad, establish a Committee of Privileges to resolve a dispute between the two Houses of the Oireachtas as to whether or not a bill is a money bill.

====Address the Oireachtas====
The president may address, or send a message to, either or both Houses of the Oireachtas. Four such addresses have been made: one by de Valera, two by Robinson, and one by McAleese. The approval of the government is needed for the message; in practice, the entire text is submitted.

====Address the Nation====
The president may &quot;address a message to the Nation&quot; subject to the same conditions as an address to the Oireachtas. This power has never been used. Commonplace messages, such as Christmas greetings, are not considered to qualify.

====Convene extraordinary meetings of the Oireachtas====
The president may convene a meeting of either or both Houses of the Oireachtas. This power would allow the president to step in if, in extraordinary circumstances, the ordinary procedures for convening the houses had broken down.

==Selection==

The president is directly elected by secret ballot using the instant-runoff voting, the single-winner analogue of the single transferable vote. Under the Presidential Elections Act, 1993 a candidate&#x27;s election formally takes place in the form of a &#x27;declaration&#x27; by the returning officer. Where more than one candidate is nominated, the election is &#x27;adjourned&#x27; so that a ballot can take place, allowing the electors to choose between candidates. A presidential election is held in time for the winner to take office the day after the end of the incumbent&#x27;s seven-year term. In the event of premature vacancy, an election must be held within sixty days.

Only resident Irish citizens aged eighteen or more may vote; a 1983 bill to extend the right to resident British citizens was ruled unconstitutional.

Candidates must be Irish citizens and over 35 years old. There is a discrepancy between the English- and Irish-language texts of Article 12.4.1°. According to the English text, an eligible candidate &quot;has reached his thirty-fifth year of age&quot;, whereas the Irish text states &quot; (has completed his thirty-five years)&quot;. Because a person&#x27;s thirty-fifth year of life begins on their thirty-fourth birthday, this means there is a year&#x27;s difference between the minimum ages as stated in the two texts. However, the Irish version of the subsection prevails in accordance with the rule stated in Article 25.5.4°. Various proposals have been made to amend the Constitution so as to eliminate this discrepancy. The 29th government introduced the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Age of Eligibility for Election to the Office of President) Bill 2015 to reduce the age of candidacy from 35 to 21, which was put to referendum in May 2015; the bill was heavily defeated, with approximately 73% of voters voting against.

Presidents can serve a maximum of two terms, consecutive or otherwise. They must be nominated by one of the following:
* At least 20 members of the Oireachtas; (there are 234 members)
* At least four county or city councils (there are 31 councils)
* Themselves (in the case of incumbent or former presidents who have served one term).
Where only one candidate is nominated, the candidate is deemed elected without the need for a ballot. For this reason, where there is a consensus among political parties not to have a contest, the president may be &#x27;elected&#x27; without the occurrence of an actual ballot. Since the establishment of the office this has occurred on six occasions.

The most recent presidential election was held on 26 October 2018.

==Absence of a president==
There is no office of vice president of Ireland. In the event of a premature vacancy in the presidency, a successor must be elected within sixty days. In a vacancy or where the president is unavailable, the duties and functions of the office are carried out by a presidential commission, consisting of the chief justice, the ceann comhairle (speaker) of the Dáil, and the cathaoirleach (chairperson) of the Seanad. Routine functions, such as signing bills into law, have often been fulfilled by the presidential commission when the president is abroad on a state visit. The government&#x27;s power to prevent the president leaving the state is relevant in aligning the diplomatic and legislative calendars.

Technically each president&#x27;s term of office expires at midnight on the day before the new president&#x27;s inauguration. Therefore, between midnight and the inauguration the following day the presidential duties and functions are carried out by the presidential commission. The constitution also empowers the Council of State, acting by a majority of its members, to &quot;make such provision as to them may seem meet&quot; for the exercise of the duties of the president in any contingency the constitution does not foresee. However, to date, it has never been necessary for the council to take up this role. Although an outgoing president who has been re-elected is usually described in the media as &quot;president&quot; before the taking of the Declaration of Office, that is actually incorrect. Technically, the outgoing president is a &quot;former&quot; president and, if re-elected, &quot;president-elect&quot;.

Vacancies in the presidency have occurred three times: on the death in office of Erskine Hamilton Childers in 1974, and on the resignations of Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh in 1976 and Mary Robinson in 1997.

==Official residence, salute, style and address==

The official residence of the president is Áras an Uachtaráin, located in the Phoenix Park in Dublin. The ninety-two-room building formerly served as the &#x27;out-of-season&#x27; residence of the Irish Lord Lieutenant and the residence of two of the three Irish Governors-General: Tim Healy and James McNeill. The president is normally referred to as &#x27;President&#x27; or &#x27;Uachtarán&#x27;, rather than &#x27;Mr/Madam President&#x27; or similar forms. The style used is normally &quot;His Excellency/Her Excellency&quot; (); sometimes people may orally address the president as &#x27;Your Excellency&#x27; ( ), or simply &#x27;President&#x27; ( (vocative case)). The Presidential Salute is taken from the National Anthem, &quot;&quot;. It consists of the first four bars followed by the last five, without lyrics.

==Inauguration==

The inauguration ceremony takes place on the day following the expiry of the term of office of the preceding president. No location is specified in the constitution, but all inaugurations have taken place in Saint Patrick&#x27;s Hall in the State Apartments in Dublin Castle. The ceremony is transmitted live by national broadcaster RTÉ on its principal television and radio channels, typically from around 11 am. To highlight the significance of the event, all key figures in the executive (the government of Ireland), the legislature (Oireachtas) and the judiciary attend, as do members of the diplomatic corps and other invited guests.

During the period of the Irish Free State (1922 to 1937), the governor-general had been installed into office as the representative of the Crown in a low-key ceremony, twice in Leinster House (the seat of the Oireachtas), but in the case of the last governor-general, Domhnall Ua Buachalla, in his brother&#x27;s drawing room. By contrast, the Constitution of Ireland adopted in 1937 requires the president&#x27;s oath of office be taken in public.

==Impeachment and removal from office==
The president can be removed from office in two ways, neither of which has ever been invoked. The Supreme Court, in a sitting of at least five judges, may find the president &quot;permanently incapacitated&quot;, while the Oireachtas may remove the president for &quot;stated misbehaviour&quot;. Either house of the Oireachtas may instigate the latter process by passing an impeachment resolution, provided at least thirty members move it and at least two-thirds support it. The other house will then either investigate the stated charges or commission a body to do so; following which at least two-thirds of members must agree both that the president is guilty and that the charges warrant removal.

==Security and transport==

As head of state of Ireland, the president receives the highest level of protection in the state. Áras an Uachtaráin is protected by armed guards from the Garda Síochána and Defence Forces at all times, and is encircled by security fencing and intrusion detection systems. At all times the president travels with an armed security detail in Ireland and overseas, which is provided by the Special Detective Unit (SDU), an elite wing of the Irish police force. Protection is increased if there is a known threat. The presidential limousine is a Mercedes-Benz S-Class LWB. The Presidential Limousine is dark navy blue and carries the presidential standard on the left front wing and the tricolour on the right front wing. When travelling the presidential limousine is always accompanied by support cars (normally BMW 5 Series, Audi A6 and Volvo S60 driven by trained drivers from the SDU) and several Garda motorcycle outriders from the Garda Traffic Corps which form a protective convoy around the car.

The president-elect is usually escorted to and from the ceremony by the Presidential Motorcycle Escort ceremonial outriders. Until 1947 they were a cavalry mounted escort, wearing light blue hussar-style uniforms. However to save money the first Inter-Party Government replaced the Irish horses by Japanese motorbikes, which the then Minister for Defence believed would be &quot;much more impressive&quot;.

At the presidential inauguration in 1945, alongside the mounted escort on horseback, president-elect Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly rode in the old state landau of Queen Alexandra. The use of the state carriage was highly popular with crowds. However an accident with a later presidential carriage at the Royal Dublin Society Horse show led to the abolition of the carriage and its replacement by a Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith in 1947. The distinctive 1947 Rolls-Royce is still used to bring the president to and from the inauguration today.

The Presidential State Car is a 1947 Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith landaulette, which is used only for ceremonial occasions.

The president also has the full use of all Irish Air Corps aircraft at his/her disposal if so needed, including helicopters and private jets.

==History==
The office of president was established in 1937, in part as a replacement for the office of governor-general that existed during the 1922–37 Irish Free State. The seven-year term of office of the president was inspired by that of the presidents of Weimar Germany. At the time the office was established critics warned that the post might lead to the emergence of a dictatorship. However, these fears were not borne out as successive presidents played a limited, largely apolitical role in national affairs.

===Head of state from 1937 to 1949===

During the period of 1937 to 1949 it was unclear whether the Irish head of state was actually the president of Ireland or George VI, the king of Ireland. This period of confusion ended in 1949 when the state was declared to be a republic. The 1937 constitution did not mention the king, but neither did it state that the president was head of state, saying rather that the president &quot;shall take precedence over all other persons in the State&quot;. The president exercised some powers that could be exercised by heads of state but which could also be exercised by governors or governors-general, such as appointing the government and promulgating the law.

However, upon his accession to the throne in 1936, George VI had been proclaimed, as previous monarchs had been, &quot;King of Ireland&quot; and, under the External Relations Act of the same year, it was this king who represented the state in its foreign affairs. Treaties, therefore, were signed in the name of the King of Ireland, who also accredited ambassadors and received the letters of credence of foreign diplomats. This role meant, in any case, that George VI was the Irish head of state in the eyes of foreign nations. The Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which came into force in April 1949, proclaimed a republic and transferred the role of representing the state abroad from the monarch to the president. No change was made to the constitution.

According to Desmond Oulton (owner of Clontarf Castle), his father John George Oulton had suggested to Éamon de Valera towards the end of the Irish Free State, that Ireland should have its own king again, as it was in the times of Gaelic Ireland. He suggested to him, a member of the O&#x27;Brien Clan, descended in the paternal line from Brian Boru, a previous High King of Ireland: the most senior representative at the time was Donough O&#x27;Brien, 16th Baron Inchiquin. Oulton said that Donough&#x27;s nephew Conor O&#x27;Brien, 18th Baron Inchiquin, confirmed that De Valera did offer Donough O&#x27;Brien the title of Prince-President of the Irish Republic, but this was turned down and so a President of Ireland was instituted instead.

===Evolving role===
After the inaugural presidency of Douglas Hyde, who was an interparty nominee for the office, the nominees of the Fianna Fáil political party won every presidential election until 1990. The party traditionally used the nomination as a reward for its most senior and prominent members, such as party founder and longtime Taoiseach Éamon de Valera and European Commissioner Patrick Hillery. Most of its occupants to that time followed Hyde&#x27;s precedent-setting conception of the presidency as a conservative, low-key institution that used its ceremonial prestige and few discretionary powers sparingly. In fact, the presidency was such a quiet position that Irish politicians sought to avoid contested presidential elections as often as possible, feeling that the attention such elections would bring to the office was an unnecessary distraction, and office-seekers facing economic austerity would often suggest the elimination of the office as a money-saving measure.

Despite the historical meekness of the presidency, however, it has been at the centre of some high-profile controversies. In particular, the fifth president, Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, faced a contentious dispute with the government in 1976 over the signing of a bill declaring a state of emergency, which ended in Ó Dálaigh&#x27;s resignation. His successor, Patrick Hillery, was also involved in a controversy in 1982, when then-Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald requested a dissolution of the Dáil Éireann. Hillery was bombarded with phone calls from opposition members urging him to refuse the request, an action that Hillery saw as highly inappropriate interference with the president&#x27;s constitutional role and resisted the political pressure.

The presidency began to be transformed in the 1990s. Hillery&#x27;s conduct regarding the dissolution affair in 1982 came to light in 1990, imbuing the office with a new sense of dignity and stability. However, it was Hillery&#x27;s successor, seventh president Mary Robinson, who ultimately revolutionized the presidency. The winner of an upset victory in the highly controversial election of 1990, Robinson was the Labour nominee, the first president to defeat Fianna Fáil in an election and the first female president. Upon election, however, Robinson took steps to de-politicize the office. She also sought to widen the scope of the presidency, developing new economic, political and cultural links between the state and other countries and cultures, especially those of the Irish diaspora. Robinson used the prestige of the office to activist ends, placing emphasis during her presidency on the needs of developing countries, linking the history of the Great Irish Famine to today&#x27;s nutrition, poverty and policy issues, attempting to create a bridge of partnership between developed and developing countries. Since 2019 the President has attended annual meetings of the Arraiolos Group of European non-executive presidents.

===Remuneration and expenses===
After the 2018 presidential election the official salary or &quot;personal remuneration&quot; of the president will be €249,014. The incumbent, Michael D. Higgins, chooses to receive the same salary although he is entitled to a higher figure of €325,507. The president&#x27;s total &quot;emoluments and allowances&quot; includes an additional €317,434 for expenses. The Office of the President&#x27;s total budget estimate for 2017 was €3.9 million, of which €2.6 million was for pay and running costs, and the balance for the &quot;President&#x27;s Bounty&quot; paid to centenarians on their hundredth birthday.

The salary was fixed at IR£5000 from 1938 to 1973, since when it has been calculated as 10% greater than that of the Chief Justice. After the post-2008 Irish economic downturn most public-sector workers took significant pay cuts, but the Constitution prohibited a reduction in the salary of the president and the judiciary during their terms of office, in order to prevent such a reduction being used by the government to apply political pressure on them. While a 2011 Constitutional amendment allows judges&#x27; pay to be cut, it did not extend to the president, although incumbent Mary McAleese offered to take a voluntary cut in solidarity.

==Issues of controversy==
===Role of the president in relation to Northern Ireland===
The text of the Constitution of Ireland, as originally enacted in 1937, made reference in its Articles 2 and 3 to two geopolitical entities: a thirty-two county &#x27;national territory&#x27; (i.e., the island of Ireland), and a twenty-six county &#x27;state&#x27; formerly known as the Irish Free State. The implication behind the title &#x27;president of Ireland&#x27; was that the president would function as the head of all Ireland. However, this implication was challenged by the Ulster Unionists and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland which was the state internationally acknowledged as having sovereignty over Northern Ireland. Articles 2 and 3 were substantially amended in consequence of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.

Ireland in turn challenged the proclamation in the United Kingdom of Queen Elizabeth II in 1952 as &#x27;[Queen] of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland&#x27;. The Irish government refused to attend royal functions as a result; for example, Patrick Hillery declined on government advice to attend the wedding of the Prince of Wales to Lady Diana Spencer in 1981, to which he had been invited by Queen Elizabeth, just as Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly had declined on government advice to attend the 1953 Coronation Garden Party at the British Embassy in Dublin. Britain in turn insisted on referring to the president as &#x27;president of the Republic of Ireland&#x27; or &#x27;president of the Irish Republic&#x27;. Letters of Credence from Queen Elizabeth, on the British government&#x27;s advice, appointing United Kingdom ambassadors to Ireland were not addressed to the &#x27;president of Ireland&#x27; but to the president personally (for example: &#x27;President Hillery&#x27;).

The naming dispute and consequent avoidance of contact at head of state level has gradually thawed since 1990. President Robinson (1990–97) chose unilaterally to break the taboo by regularly visiting the United Kingdom for public functions, frequently in connection with Anglo-Irish Relations or to visit the Irish emigrant community in Great Britain. In another breaking of precedent, she accepted an invitation to Buckingham Palace by Queen Elizabeth II. Palace accreditation supplied to journalists referred to the &quot;visit of the president of Ireland&quot;. Between 1990 and 2010, both Robinson and her successor President McAleese (1997–2011) visited the Palace on numerous occasions, while senior members of the British royal family – the then-Prince of Wales (now Charles III); the Duke of York; Prince Edward, then Earl of Wessex; and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh – all visited both presidents of Ireland at Áras an Uachtaráin. The presidents also attended functions with the Princess Royal. President Robinson jointly hosted a reception with the queen at St. James&#x27;s Palace, London, in 1995, to commemorate the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the foundation of the Queen&#x27;s Colleges in 1845 (the Queen&#x27;s Colleges are now known as Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, University College Cork, and the University of Galway). These contacts eventually led to a state visit of Elizabeth II to Ireland in 2011.

Though the president&#x27;s title implicitly asserted authority in Northern Ireland, in reality the Irish president needed government permission to visit there. (The Constitution of Ireland in Article 3 explicitly stated that &quot;[p]ending the re-integration of the national territory&quot; the authority of the Irish state did not extend to Northern Ireland. Presidents prior to the presidency of Mary Robinson were regularly refused permission by the Irish government to visit Northern Ireland.)

However, since the 1990s and in particular since the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, the president has regularly visited Northern Ireland. President McAleese, who was the first president to have been born in Northern Ireland, continued on from President Robinson in this regard. In a sign of the warmth of modern British-Irish relations, she has even been warmly welcomed by most leading unionists. At the funeral for a child murdered by the Real IRA in Omagh she symbolically walked up the main aisle of the church hand-in-hand with the Ulster Unionist Party leader and then First Minister of Northern Ireland, David Trimble. But in other instances, Mary McAleese had been criticised for certain comments, such as a reference to the way in which Protestant children in Northern Ireland had been brought up to hate Catholics just as German children had been encouraged to hate Jews under the Nazi regime, on 27 January 2005, following her attendance at the ceremony commemorating the sixtieth anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz concentration camp. These remarks caused outrage among Northern Ireland&#x27;s unionist politicians, and McAleese later apologised and conceded that her statement had been unbalanced.

===Suggestions for reform===
There have been many suggestions for reforming the office of president over the years. In 1996, the Constitutional Review Group recommended that the office of President should remain largely unchanged. However, it suggested that the Constitution should be amended to explicitly declare the president to be head of state (at present that term does not appear in the text), and that consideration be given to the introduction of a constructive vote of no confidence system in the Dáil, along the lines of that in Germany. If this system were introduced then the power of the president to refuse a Dáil dissolution would be largely redundant and could be taken away. The All-party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution&#x27;s 1998 Report made similar recommendations.

In an October 2009 poll, concerning support for various potential candidates in the 2011 presidential election conducted by the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, a &quot;significant number&quot; of people were said to feel that the presidency is a waste of money and should be abolished.

==List of presidents of Ireland==
The functions of the president were exercised by the Presidential Commission from the coming into force of the Constitution on 29 December 1937 until the election of Douglas Hyde in 1938, and during the vacancies of 1974, 1976, and 1997.

Former presidents who are able and willing to act are members of the Council of State.

<text>The premier of Queensland is the head of government in the Australian state of Queensland.

By convention the premier is the leader of the party with a parliamentary majority in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. The premier is appointed by the governor of Queensland.

The incumbent premiership is that of David Crisafulli.

==Constitutional role==
Under section 43 of the Constitution of Queensland the premier and other members of Cabinet are appointed by the governor. They are collectively responsible to Parliament in accordance with responsible government. The text of the Constitution assigns to the premier certain powers, such as the power to assign roles (s 25) to assistant ministers (formerly known as parliamentary secretaries), and to appoint ministers as acting ministers (s 45) for a period of 14 days.

In practice, under the conventions of the Westminster System followed in Queensland, the premier&#x27;s power is derived from two sources: command of a majority in the Legislative Assembly, and the premier&#x27;s role as chair of Cabinet, determining the appointment and roles of ministers. Although ministerial appointments are the prerogative of the governor of Queensland, in normal circumstances the governor will make these appointments on the advice of the premier.

Immediately following an election for the Legislative Assembly, the governor will call on the leader of the party which commands a majority in the Legislative Assembly to become premier and ask them to commission a government. A re-elected government will be resworn, with adjustments to the ministry as determined by the premier.

Prior to the existence of political parties within the Leglislative Assembly, to become premier, that member had to be able to command the support of a majority of the individual members of the assembly; this group of members were known informally as &quot;Ministerialists&quot;, while those who did not support the member who became premier were known informally as &quot;Oppositionists&quot; (or the Opposition).

==Premier&#x27;s office==
The premier has an office in the Executive Annexe of Parliament House, Brisbane, which is normally used while Parliament is sitting. At other times the premier&#x27;s ministerial office is in 1 William Street, which is across the road from the Executive Annexe.

==List of premiers of Queensland==
Before the 1890s, there was no developed party system in Queensland. Political affiliation labels before that time indicate a general tendency only. Before the end of the first decade of the twentieth century, political parties were more akin to parliamentary factions, and were fluid, informal and disorganised by modern standards.

<text>The premier of South Australia is the head of government in the state of South Australia, Australia. The Government of South Australia follows the Westminster system, with a Parliament of South Australia acting as the legislature. The premier is appointed by the governor of South Australia, and by modern convention holds office by virtue of their ability to command the support of a majority of members of the lower house of Parliament, the House of Assembly.

Peter Malinauskas is the current premier, having served since 21 March 2022.

==History==

The office of premier of South Australia was established upon the commencement of responsible government with the passage of the &quot;Constitution Act 1856&quot;. The role was based upon that of the prime minister of the United Kingdom, with the premier requiring the support of a majority of the members of the lower house to remain head of government. For the early years of responsible government, the office was held in conjuction with that of Chief Secretary of South Australia, a role that had existed since colonsiation, but by the 1890&#x27;s, this was no longer a convention.

No parties or solid groupings would be formed until after the 1890 election, which resulted in frequent changes of the premier of South Australia. If for any reason the incumbent premier lost sufficient support through a successful motion of no confidence at any time on the floor of the house, he would tender his resignation to the governor of South Australia, which would result in another member deemed to have the support of the House of Assembly being sworn in by the governor as the next premier.

Informal groupings began and increased government stability occurred from the 1887 election. The United Labor Party would be formed in 1891, while the National Defence League would be formed later in the same year.

Before the 1890s when there was no formal party system in South Australia, MPs tended to have historical liberal or conservative beliefs. The liberals dominated government from the 1893 election to 1905 election with the support of the South Australian United Labor Party, with the conservatives mostly in opposition. Labor took government with the support of eight dissident liberals in 1905 when Labor won the most seats for the first time. The rise of Labor saw non-Labor politics start to merge into various party incarnations.

The two independent conservative parties, the Australasian National League (formerly the National Defence League) and the Farmers and Producers Political Union merged with the Liberal and Democratic Union to become the Liberal Union in 1910. Labor formed South Australia&#x27;s first majority government after winning the 1910 state election, triggering the merger. The 1910 election came two weeks after federal Labor formed Australia&#x27;s first elected majority government at the 1910 federal election.

No &quot;Country&quot; or rural conservative parties emerged as serious long-term forces in South Australian state politics, the majority folding into the main non-Labor party.

==List of premiers of South Australia==
The first six governors of South Australia oversaw governance from proclamation in 1836 until self-government and an elected Parliament of South Australia was enacted in the year prior to the inaugural 1857 election.

<doc id="24680" wikidata="Q1550276" url="?curid=24680" title="Premier of Western Australia">
<text>The premier of Western Australia is the head of government of the state of Western Australia. The role of premier at a state level is similar to the role of the prime minister of Australia at a federal level. The premier leads the executive branch of the Government of Western Australia and is accountable to the Parliament of Western Australia. The premier is appointed by the governor of Western Australia. By convention, the governor appoints as premier whoever has the support of the majority of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, the lower house of the Parliament of Western Australia. In practice, this means that the premier is the leader of the political party or group of parties with a majority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. Since Western Australia achieved self-governance in 1890, there have been 31 premiers. Roger Cook is the current premier, having been appointed to the position on 8 June 2023.

==History==
The position of premier is not mentioned in the constitution of Western Australia. From 1890 to 1917, the premier was not an official position, rather, it was the title unofficially given, but widely used to refer, to the head of the government. When Western Australia became a self-governing colony in 1890, Governor William Robinson initially indicated he would use the title &quot;prime minister&quot; to refer to the head of the government. However, after he appointed John Forrest, the title &quot;premier&quot; was used for consistency with the other Australian colonies. The position was first officially mentioned when the governor appointed Henry Lefroy as premier on 28 June 1917. However, when the governor designated and declared the six executive offices of the government on 2 July 1917, the position of premier was not listed, creating an ambiguity. It was not until 3 April 1947 that the premier became one of the executive offices of the government.

The most common cause for a change of premier is an election. Since the 1990s, elections have occurred roughly every four years. Before then, elections were at most three years apart, except for during World War II. A less common cause for a change of premier is the ruling party changing its leader. This can occur as a result of a resignation, death or leadership spill. In this case, the new premier is whoever the party elects as its new leader. Another cause for a change of premier is a loss of majority support in the Legislative Assembly. This commonly occurred in the first three decades of self-governance, but has not occurred since 1916. If this occurs, the premier must either resign or be dismissed by the governor.

==Powers and function==
The powers of the premier are set out by convention and by legislation. By convention, the premier advises the Monarch of Australia as to who to appoint as governor. The premier advises the governor as to who to appoint to cabinet and which portfolios should be given to each cabinet minister. The premier sets out the responsibilities of ministers and the acts that they would administer. The premier leads the cabinet and chairs cabinet meetings. They communicate with the governor, the cabinet, the state government, other state and territory governments, the federal government, and overseas governments. The premier advises the governor on when state elections should be held. They oversee the Department of the Premier and Cabinet. While premier, they stay as a member of parliament and they retain their responsibility for representing their electoral district.

==Characteristics==
As of 2023, there have been 31 premiers of Western Australia. Carmen Lawrence, who was appointed on 12 February 1990, is the first and only woman to be premier of Western Australia. She is also the first woman to be premier of an Australian state. By convention, the premier is a member of the Legislative Assembly. However, the premier can be a member of either house of parliament. Hal Colebatch is the only premier to be a member of the Legislative Council (upper house). He served for 30 days in 1919, making him the shortest serving premier of Western Australia. David Brand is the longest serving premier, serving for 11 years and 335 days between 1959 and 1971. The youngest premier is John Scaddan, who was 35 years, 2 months and 3 days old when he was sworn in in 1911. The oldest premier is John Tonkin, who was 69 years, 1 month and 1 day old when he was sworn in in 1971. Newton Moore became premier after two years in parliament, the least time aside from Forrest. Tonkin became premier after almost 38 years in parliament, the most time in parliament before becoming premier. The only father and son pair to have both been premier is Charles Court and his son Richard Court. George Leake, who died of pneumonia on 24 June 1902, is the only premier to have died in office. Moore, Philip Collier, John Willcock and Geoff Gallop are the only premiers to have resigned due to ill health.

Forrest, Colebatch and Lawrence are the only premiers to have served in the Parliament of Australia as well. Forrest and Lawrence are the only premiers to have been ministers in the Government of Australia as well. Moore is the only premier to have served in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The only premier to subsequently serve as governor is James Mitchell. George Leake, Frank Wilson, Phillip Collier and Mitchell are the only people to have been premier more than once. There are currently eight living former premiers. The most recent premier to die is Ray O&#x27;Connor, who was premier from 1982 to 1983 and died in 2013.

Two former premiers have been sentenced to jail. In 1994, Brian Burke was sentenced to two years in jail for defrauding the state by $17,000 by making false claims on the parliamentary imprest account. He was released on parole after serving seven months. In 1995, O&#x27;Connor served six months in jail for stealing a $25,000 cheque from the Bond Corporation during his time as premier. In 1997, Burke was sentenced to three years jail for stealing $122,585 in Labor Party campaign donations. He served six months before this conviction was quashed upon appeal.

<doc id="24681" wikidata="Q3235843" url="?curid=24681" title="Pigeonhole sort">
<text>Pigeonhole sorting is a sorting algorithm that is suitable for sorting lists of elements where the number &quot;n&quot; of elements and the length &quot;N&quot; of the range of possible key values are approximately the same. It requires O(&quot;n&quot; + &quot;N&quot;) time. It is similar to counting sort, but differs in that it &quot;moves items twice: once to the bucket array and again to the final destination [whereas] counting sort builds an auxiliary array then uses the array to compute each item&#x27;s final destination and move the item there.&quot;

The pigeonhole algorithm works as follows:
# Given an array of values to be sorted, set up an auxiliary array of initially empty &quot;pigeonholes&quot; (analogous to a pigeon-hole messagebox in an office or desk), one pigeonhole for each key in the range of the keys in the original array.
# Going over the original array, put each value into the pigeonhole corresponding to its key, such that each pigeonhole eventually contains a list of all values with that key.
# Iterate over the pigeonhole array in increasing order of keys, and for each pigeonhole, put its elements into the original array in increasing order.

==Example==
Suppose one were sorting these value pairs by their first element:

* (5, &quot;hello&quot;)
* (3, &quot;pie&quot;)
* (8, &quot;apple&quot;)
* (5, &quot;king&quot;)

For each value between 3 and 8 we set up a pigeonhole, then move each element to its pigeonhole:

* 3: (3, &quot;pie&quot;)
* 4:
* 5: (5, &quot;hello&quot;), (5, &quot;king&quot;)
* 6:
* 7:
* 8: (8, &quot;apple&quot;)

The pigeonhole array is then iterated over in order, and the elements are moved back to the original list.

The difference between pigeonhole sort and counting sort is that in counting sort, the auxiliary array does not contain lists of input elements, only counts:

* 3: 1
* 4: 0
* 5: 2
* 6: 0
* 7: 0
* 8: 1

For arrays where &quot;N&quot; is much larger than &quot;n&quot;, bucket sort is a generalization that is more efficient in space and time.

<text>Pope Innocent XIII (; ; 13 May 1655 – 7 March 1724), born as Michelangelo dei Conti, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 8 May 1721 to his death in March 1724. He is the most recent pope to take the pontifical name of &quot;Innocent&quot; upon his election.

Pope Innocent XIII was reform-oriented, and he imposed new standards of frugality, abolishing excessive spending. He took steps to end the practice of nepotism by issuing a decree which forbade his successors from granting land, offices or income to any relatives – something opposed by many cardinals who hoped that they might become pope and benefit their families.

Michelangelo dei Conti was born on 13 May 1655 in Poli, near Rome as the son of Carlo II, Duke of Poli, and Isabella d&#x27;Monti. Like Pope Innocent III (1198–1216), Pope Gregory IX (1227–1241) and Pope Alexander IV (1254–1261), he was a member of the aristocratic landowning family of the Conti, who held the titles of counts and dukes of Segni. He included the family shield in his pontifical coats of arms.

Conti commenced his studies in Ancona and then with the Jesuits in Rome at the Collegio Romano and then later at La Sapienza University. After he received his doctorate in canon law and civil law, he was ordained to the priesthood. Conti also served as the Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura in 1691, later to be appointed as the Governor of Ascoli until 1692. Conti was also the Governor of Campagna and Marittima from 1692 to 1693 and the Governor of Viterbo from 1693 to 1695.

Pope Innocent XII selected Conti as the Titular Archbishop of Tarsus on 13 June 1695 and he received his episcopal consecration on 16 June 1695 in Rome. Conti was also the nuncio to both Switzerland and Portugal.

===Cardinalate===
On 7 June 1706, Conti was elevated to the cardinalate under Pope Clement XI (1700–21) and was made the Cardinal-Priest of Santi Quirico e Giulitta. His appointment came about as the replacement of Gabriele Filippucci who resigned the cardinalate. He would receive his titular church on 23 February 1711. From 1697 to 1710 he acted as papal nuncio to the Kingdom of Portugal, where he is believed to have formed those unfavourable impressions of the Jesuits which afterwards influenced his conduct towards them. While in Portugal, he was witness to Father Bartolomeu de Gusmão&#x27;s early aerostat experiments.

He was also transferred to Osimo as its archbishop in 1709 and was later translated one last time to Viterbo e Toscanella in 1712. He resigned his position in his diocese due to illness in 1719.

==Pontificate==
===Papal election===

After the death of Pope Clement XI in 1721, a conclave was called to choose a new pope. It took 75 ballots just to reach a decision and choose Conti as the successor of Clement XI. After all candidates seemed to slip, support turned to Conti. The curial factions also turned their attention to him. His high reputation for ability, learning, purity, and a kindly disposition secured his election, which occurred the morning of 8 May 1721. He chose the name of Innocent XIII in honour of Pope Innocent III. On the following 18 May, he was solemnly crowned by the protodeacon, Cardinal Benedetto Pamphili.

===Actions===
His pontificate was prosperous, but comparatively uneventful. He held two consistories that saw three new cardinals elevated on 16 June 1721 and 16 July 1721.

The Chinese Rites controversy that started under his predecessor continued during his reign. Innocent XIII prohibited the Jesuits from prosecuting their mission in China, and ordered that no new members should be received into the order. This indication of his sympathies encouraged some French bishops to approach him with a petition for the recall of the papal bull &quot;Unigenitus&quot; by which Jansenism had been condemned; the request, however, was peremptorily denied.

The Pope also assisted Hospitaller Malta in its struggles against the Barbary pirates.

Innocent XIII, like his predecessor, showed much favour to James Francis Edward Stuart, the &quot;Old Pretender&quot; to the British throne and liberally supported him. The pope&#x27;s cousin, Francesco Maria Conti, from Siena, became chamberlain of James&#x27; little court in the Roman Muti Palace.

====Consistories====

Innocent XIII held two consistories in which he named three cardinals. One of those new cardinals was his own brother, Bernardo Maria.

====Beatifications====
Innocent XIII beatified three individuals during his pontificate: John of Nepomuk (31 May 1721), Dalmazio Moner (13 August 1721), and Andrea dei Conti (11 December 1723).

====Doctor of the Church====
On 25 April 1722, he named Saint Isidore of Seville as a Doctor of the Church.

==Death and legacy==

Innocent XIII fell ill in 1724. He was tormented by a hernia of which he spoke to nobody but his valet. At one point, it had burst and caused inflammation and fever. Innocent XIII asked for the last rites, made his profession of faith, and died on 7 March 1724, at the age of 68. His pontificate was unremarkable, given that he was hampered by physical suffering. He was interred in the grotto at Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

Innocent XIII had suffered from a hernia about three to four months after his election but also suffered from acute attacks of pain due to kidney stones. But Innocent XIII did himself no favors with his excessive appetite and no exercise. He also suffered from lethargy that caused him to sleep a great deal. In mid-February 1724, his suffering grew worse to the point that he could no longer get up, suffering from an accumulation of water in his lower limbs in what was an indication of severe kidney problems. This led to his doctors fearing that he could develop congestive heart failure. On 3 March, despite his failing health, Innocent XIII set to work signing documents, though he suffered poor sleep that night and had a better day on 4 March. In the morning on 5 March, one of the papal doctors fed Innocent XIII a purgative, however, this backfired and only aggravated the hernia. An attempted reduction was only partially successful, resulting in a strangulated hernia, while the pope experienced great pain in the night between 5 and 6 March. However, a serious inflammation quickly set in, causing the pope to contract a fever. Innocent XIII, now very well aware of his state of health, immediately asked for the Viaticum, receiving it on 6 March as his family gathered to see him. However, there had been attempts to get the pope to name new cardinals, simply to create stronger factions in the conclave. At 4:00pm on 6 March, he signed a codicil to his will, and that night asked for and received the Extreme Unction. Innocent XIII died at sunset, around 23:00 hours (Rome time) on 7 March.

<doc id="24684" wikidata="Q103101" url="?curid=24684" title="Pope Julius I">
<text>Pope Julius I was the bishop of Rome from 6 February 337 to his death on 12 April 352. He was appealed to by Athanasius when the latter was deposed from his position as patriarch by Arian bishops, Julius then supported Athanasius and condemned his deposition as unjust. He was notable for asserting the authority of the pope over the Arian Eastern bishops, as well as setting December 25 as the official birthdate of Jesus.

==Pontificate==
Julius was a native of Rome and was chosen as successor of Pope Mark after the Roman seat had been vacant for four months.

===Arianism===
Julius is chiefly known by the part he took in the Arian controversy. After the followers of Eusebius of Nicomedia, who had become the patriarch of Constantinople, renewed their deposition of Athanasius of Alexandria at a synod held in Antioch in 341, they resolved to send delegates to Constans, emperor of the West, and also to Julius, setting forth the grounds on which they had proceeded. Julius, after expressing an opinion favourable to Athanasius, adroitly invited both parties to lay the case before a synod to be presided over by himself. This proposal, however, the Arian Eastern bishops declined to accept.

On this second banishment from Alexandria, Athanasius came to Rome, and was recognised as a regular bishop by the synod presided over by Julius in 342. Julius sent a letter to the Eastern bishops that is an early instance of the claims of primacy for the bishop of Rome. Even if Athanasius and his companions were somewhat to blame, the letter runs, the Alexandrian Church should first have written to the pope. &quot;Can you be ignorant,&quot; writes Julius, &quot;that this is the custom, that we should be written to first, so that from here what is just may be defined&quot; (Epistle of Julius to Antioch, c. xxii).

It was through the influence of Julius that, at a later date, the council of Sardica in Illyria was held, which was attended by only seventy-six Eastern bishops, who speedily withdrew to Philippopolis and deposed Julius at the council of Philippopolis, along with Athanasius and others. The three hundred Western bishops who remained, confirmed the previous decisions of the Roman synod and issued a number of decrees regarding church discipline. The first canon forbade the transfer of bishops from one see to another, for if frequently made, it was seen to encourage covetousness and ambition.

By its 3rd, 4th, and 5th decrees relating to the rights of revision claimed by Julius, the council of Sardica perceptibly helped forward the claims of the bishop of Rome. Julius built several basilicas and churches.

=== Christmas ===
Some have stated that, around 350 AD, Julius I declared December 25 as the official date of the birth of Jesus; this is based on a letter quoted only in a 9th-century source, and this letter is spurious. At the time this was one of the commonly believed dates for Jesus&#x27; birth and was used by Hippolytus of Rome in his Commentary on Daniel around 200 AD. It is claimed – falsely – that Pope Julius declared December 25 as Christmas after patriarch Cyril of Jerusalem asked for clarification on what date historical records stored in Rome indicate as Jesus&#x27; birth. It was also believed that Jesus and John the Baptist were born around the same time from reading the Gospel of Luke.

The actual date of Jesus&#x27;s birth is unknown. It has been noted that 25 December is two days after the end of the Roman festival of Saturnalia. Some have speculated that part of the reason this date was chosen may have been because Julius was trying to create a Christian alternative to Saturnalia. Another reason for the decision may have been because, in 274 AD, the Roman emperor Aurelian had allegedly declared 25 December the birthdate of Sol Invictus and that Julius I allegedly may have thought that he could attract more converts to Christianity by allowing them to continue to celebrate on the same day, but this cannot be historically verified. He may have also been influenced by the idea that Jesus had died on the anniversary of his conception; because Jesus died during Passover and, in the third century AD, Passover was celebrated on 25 March, he may have assumed that Jesus&#x27;s birthday must have come nine months later, on 25 December.

==Death and veneration==
Julius I died in Rome on 12 April 352. He was succeeded by Liberius. Julius is venerated as a saint by the Catholic Church. His feast day is on 12 April.

<doc id="24685" wikidata="Q169911" url="?curid=24685" title="Pope Julius III">
<text>Pope Julius III (; ; 10 September 1487 – 23 March 1555), born Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 22 February 1550 to his death, in March 1555.

After a career as a distinguished and effective diplomat, he was elected to the papacy as a compromise candidate after the death of Paul III. As pope, he made only reluctant and short-lived attempts at reform, mostly devoting himself to a life of personal pleasure. His reputation, and that of the Catholic Church, were greatly harmed by his scandal-ridden relationship with his adopted nephew, Innocenzo Ciocchi Del Monte.

==Education and early career==
Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte was born in Monte San Savino, the son of a distinguished Roman jurist. He was educated by the humanist Raffaele Brandolini Lippo, and later studied law at Perugia and Siena. During his career, he distinguished himself as a brilliant canonist rather than as a theologian.

Del Monte was the nephew of Antonio Maria Ciocchi del Monte, Archbishop of Manfredonia (1506–1511). His uncle exchanged this see for a position as a Cardinal in 1511; Giovanni Maria Ciocchi del Monte succeeded to Manfredonia in 1513. In 1520, del Monte also became Bishop of Pavia. Popular for his affable manner and respected for his administrative skills, he was twice Prefect of Rome and was entrusted by the papal curia with several duties. At the Sack of Rome (1527) he was one of the hostages given by Pope Clement VII to the Emperor&#x27;s forces, and barely escaped execution. Pope Paul III created him Cardinal-Priest of San Vitale on 22 December, 1536; and raised him to the dignity of cardinal-bishop with the Diocese of Palestrina on 5 October, 1543. He was employed him in several important legations, notably as papal legate and first president of the Council of Trent (1545/47) and then at Bologna (1547/48).

==Papacy==
===Election===

Paul III died on 10 November 1549, and in the ensuing conclave the forty-eight cardinals were divided into three factions: of the primary factions, the Imperial faction wished to see the Council of Trent reconvened, the French faction wished to see it dropped. The Farnese faction, loyal to the family of the previous Pope, supported the election of Paul III&#x27;s grandson, Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, and also the family&#x27;s claim to the Duchy of Parma, which was contested by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor.

Neither the French nor the Germans favoured del Monte, and the Emperor had expressly excluded him from the list of acceptable candidates, but the French were able to block the other two factions, allowing del Monte to promote himself as a compromise candidate and be elected on 7 February 1550. Ottavio Farnese, whose support had been crucial to the election, was immediately confirmed as Duke of Parma. But, when Farnese applied to France for aid against the emperor, Julius allied himself with the emperor, declared Farnese deprived of his fief, and sent troops under the command of his nephew Giambattista del Monte to co-operate with governor Ferrante Gonzaga of Milan in the capture of Parma.

===Church reforms===
At the start of his reign Julius had seriously desired to bring about a reform of the Catholic Church and to reconvene the Council of Trent, but very little was actually achieved during his five years in office. In 1551, at the request of Emperor Charles V, he consented to the reopening of the Council of Trent and entered into a league against the duke of Parma and Henry II of France (1547–59), causing the War of Parma. However, Julius soon came to terms with the duke and France and in 1553 suspended the meetings of the council.

Henry had threatened to withdraw recognition from the Pope if the new Pope was pro-Habsburg in orientation, and when Julius III reconvened the Council of Trent, Henry blocked French bishops from attending and did not enforce the papal decrees in France. Even after Julius III suspended the council again he proceeded to bully the pope into taking his side against the Habsburgs by threatening schism.

Julius increasingly contented himself with Italian politics and retired to his luxurious palace at the Villa Giulia, which he had built for himself close to the Porta del Popolo. From there he passed the time in comfort, emerging from time to time to make timid efforts to reform the Church through the reestablishment of the reform commissions. He was a friend of the Jesuits, to whom he granted a fresh confirmation in 1550; and through the papal bull, &quot;Dum sollicita&quot; of August 1552, he founded the Collegium Germanicum, and granted an annual income.

During his pontificate, Catholicism was restored in England under Queen Mary in 1553. Julius sent Cardinal Reginald Pole as legate with powers that he could use at his discretion to help the restoration succeed. In February 1555, an envoy was dispatched from the English Parliament to Julius to inform him of the country&#x27;s formal submission, but the pope died before the envoy reached Rome.

Shortly before his death, Julius dispatched Cardinal Giovanni Morone to represent the interests of the Holy See at the Peace of Augsburg. His inactivity during the last three years of his pontificate may have been caused by the frequent and severe attacks of gout.

===Artistic endeavors===

The pope&#x27;s lack of interest in political or ecclesiastical affairs caused dismay among his contemporaries. When his efforts at church reform proved ineffective, Julius III focused his attentions instead on artistic and architectural commissions as well as his lavish Villa Giulia. He spent the bulk of his time, and a great deal of papal money, on entertainments at the Villa Giulia, created for him by Vignola. Bartolomeo Ammannati designed a number of garden features under the general direction of Giorgio Vasari, with guidance from the knowledgeable pope and Michelangelo, who worked there. Today the Villa Giulia houses the National Etruscan Museum, a collection of Etruscan art and artifacts. 

More significant and lasting was his patronage of the great Renaissance composer Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, whom he brought to Rome as his &quot;maestro di cappella&quot;. 

===The Innocenzo scandal===
Julius&#x27; papacy was marked by scandals, the most notable of which is centered around the pope&#x27;s adoptive nephew, Innocenzo Ciocchi Del Monte. Innocenzo del Monte was a teenaged beggar found in the streets of Parma who was hired by the family as a lowly hall boy in their primary residence, the boy&#x27;s age being variously given as 14, 15, or 17 years. After the elevation of Julius to the papacy, Innocenzo Del Monte was adopted into the family by the pope&#x27;s brother and was then promptly created cardinal-nephew by Julius. The pope showered his favourite with benefices, including the &quot;commendatario&quot; of the abbeys of Mont Saint-Michel in Normandy and Saint Zeno in Verona, and, later, of the abbeys of Saint Saba, Miramondo, Grottaferrata and Frascati, among others. As rumours began to circle about the particular relationship between the pope and his adoptive nephew, Julius refused to take advice. The cardinals Reginald Pole and Giovanni Carafa warned the pope of the &quot;evil suppositions to which the elevation of a fatherless young man would give rise&quot;.

The courtier and poet Girolamo Muzio in a letter of 1550 to Ferrante Gonzaga, governor of Milan, wrote: &quot;They write many bad things about this new pope; that he is vicious, proud, and odd in the head.&quot;

The poet Joachim du Bellay, who lived in Rome through this period in the retinue of his relative, Cardinal Jean du Bellay, expressed his scandalised opinion of Julius in two sonnets in his series Les regrets (1558), hating to see, he wrote, &quot;a Ganymede with the red hat on his head&quot;. 

The Pope&#x27;s political enemies likewise made capital of the scandal. In Italy, it was said that Julius showed the impatience of a &quot;lover awaiting a mistress&quot; while awaiting Innocenzo&#x27;s arrival in Rome and boasted of the boy&#x27;s prowess in bed, while the Venetian ambassador reported that Innocenzo Del Monte shared the pope&#x27;s bed &quot;as if he [Innocenzo] were his [Julius&#x27;] own son or grandson.&quot; &quot;The charitably-disposed told themselves the boy might after all be simply his bastard son.&quot;

For some time afterwards, Protestants, too, seized upon the rumours in the cause of polemic. As late as 1597, in his work &quot;The Theatre of God&#x27;s judgement&quot;, the English Puritan clergyman Thomas Beard, asserted that it was Julius&#x27; &quot;custome ... to promote none to ecclesiastical livings, save only his buggerers&quot;. 

Despite the damage which the scandal was inflicting on the church, it was not until after Julius&#x27; death in 1555 that anything could be done to curb Innocenzo&#x27;s visibility. He underwent temporary banishment following the murder of two men who had insulted him, and then again following the rape of two women. He tried to use his connections in the College of Cardinals to plead his cause, but his influence waned, and he died in obscurity. He was buried in Rome in the del Monte family chapel. One outcome of the cardinal-nephew scandal, however, was the upgrading of the position of Papal Secretary of State, as the incumbent had to take over the duties Innocenzo Del Monte was unfit to perform: the Secretary of State eventually replaced the cardinal-nephew as the most important official of the Holy See.

===Other activities===
====Consistories====

Throughout his pontificate, Julius III named twenty new cardinals in four consistories, including one cardinal whom he nominated &quot;in pectore&quot; in 1551 and revealed in the following year.

====Beatifications====
While he did not canonize any saints during his papacy, Julius III did beatify the Basilian monk and hermit Silvester of Troina.

==Death==

Julius III died at 7:00pm on 23 March 1555. Having suffered from gout in his later years (which he tried to cure simply by fasting), he died due to stomach ailments. As he was dying, he had difficulties in swallowing to the point that he ate little, having found it uncomfortable. It was believed after his death that the pope had died from stomach or esophageal cancer.

==In fiction==
In the novel &quot;Q&quot; by Luther Blissett, Julius appears toward the end of the book as a moderate cardinal favouring religious tolerance, in the upheavals caused by the Reformation and the Roman Church&#x27;s response during the 16th century. His election as pope and the subsequent unleashing of the Inquisition form the last chapters of the novel.

<doc id="24686" wikidata="Q199498" url="?curid=24686" title="Pope Eugene I">
<text>Pope Eugene I (; died 2 June 657) was the bishop of Rome from 10 August 654 to his death. He was chosen to become Pope after the deposition and banishment of Martin I by Emperor Constans II over the dispute about Monothelitism.

==Unusual election==
Eugene was a Roman from the Aventine, son of Rufinianus. He was brought up in the Church&#x27;s ministry, and was already an elderly priest when a dispute flared up between the papacy in Rome, which opposed the monothelite teachings, and the imperial government in Constantinople, which supported it. As a result, Pope Martin I was deposed by Emperor Constans II and carried off from Rome on 18 June 653, eventually ending up banished to Cherson. Little is known about what happened in Rome after Martin&#x27;s departure, but it was typical in those days for the Holy See to be governed by the archpriest and archdeacon. Martin hoped that a successor would not be elected while he lived, but the imperial court exerted pressure on Rome through the exarch of Ravenna. On 10 August 654, Eugene was appointed the new pope, to which Martin acceded. The imperial government believed that Eugene would be cooperative and ratified his election.

==Pontificate==
As pope, Eugene consecrated twenty-one bishops for different parts of the world and received the youthful Wilfrid on the occasion of his first visit to Rome (c. 654).

Eugene I showed greater deference than his predecessor to the emperor&#x27;s wishes and made no public stand against the Monothelitism of the patriarchs of Constantinople. One of the first acts of the new pope was to send legates to Constantinople with letters to Emperor Constans II informing him of his election and professing his faith. The legates were deceived, or bribed, and brought back a synodical letter from Patriarch Peter of Constantinople (656–666), while the emperor&#x27;s envoy, who accompanied them, brought offerings for Saint Peter and a request from the emperor that the pope would enter into communion with the patriarch of Constantinople. Peter&#x27;s letter proved to be written in a difficult and obscure style and avoided making any specific declaration as to the number of &quot;wills or operations&quot; in Christ. When its contents were read to the clergy and people in the church of St. Mary Major in 656, they not only rejected the letter with indignation, but would not allow the pope to leave the basilica until he had promised that he would not on any account accept it.

The imperial officials were furious at this harsh rejection of the wishes of the emperor and patriarch. Constans threatened to dispose of Eugene just as he had disposed of Martin, but was preoccupied by defending the empire from the Muslim conquests.

==Death and legacy==
Eugene I died on 2 June 657, before Constans II could act against him. He was buried in Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. He was acclaimed a saint, his day being 2 June. He is commemorated as the patron and namesake of the Cathedral of Saint Eugene in the Diocese of Santa Rosa in California.

<doc id="24687" wikidata="Q104205" url="?curid=24687" title="Pope Eugene II">
<text>Pope Eugene II (; died 27 August 827) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 6 June 824 to his death. A native of Rome, he was chosen by nobles to succeed Paschal I as pope despite the clergy and the people favoring Zinzinnus. The influence of the Carolingian Franks on the selection of popes was then firmly established. Pope Eugene convened a council at Rome in 826 to condemn simony and suspend untrained clergy. It was decreed that schools were to be established at cathedral churches and other places to give instruction in sacred and secular literature. His involvement in the Byzantine Iconoclasm controversy was largely inconsequential.

==Early career==

In earlier editions of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; Eugene is said to have been the son of Boemund, but in the more recent and more accurate editions, his father&#x27;s name is not given. While he was archpriest of St Sabina on the Aventine, and was said to have fulfilled most conscientiously the duties of his position. Eugene is described by his biographer as simple and humble, learned and eloquent, handsome and generous, a lover of peace, and wholly occupied with the thought of doing what was pleasing to God.

==Accession==
Eugene was elected pope on 6 June 824, after the death of Paschal I. Paschal had attempted to curb the rapidly increasing power of the Roman nobility, who had turned for support to the Franks to strengthen their positions against him. When Paschal died, these nobles made strenuous efforts to replace him with a candidate of their own. The clergy put forward Zinzinnus, a candidate likely to continue the policy of Paschal. Even though the Roman Council of 769 under Stephen III had decreed that the nobles had no right to a real share in a papal election, the nobles were successful in securing the consecration of Eugene. Eugene&#x27;s candidacy was endorsed by Abbot Walla, who was then in Rome and served as a councilor to both the current emperor, Louis the Pious, and his predecessor, Charlemagne.

The election of Eugene II was a triumph for the Franks, and they subsequently resolved to improve their position. Emperor Louis the Pious accordingly sent his son Lothair I to Rome to strengthen the Frankish influence. The Roman nobles who had been banished during the preceding reign and fled to France were recalled, and their property was restored to them. A &quot;Constitutio Romana&quot; was then agreed upon between the pope and the emperor in 824 which advanced the imperial pretensions in the city of Rome, but also checked the power of the nobles. This constitution included the statute that no pope should be consecrated until his election had the approval of the Frankish emperor. It decreed that those who were under the special protection of the pope or emperor were to be inviolable, and that church property not be plundered after the death of a pope.

==Pontificate==

Seemingly before Lothair left Rome, there arrived ambassadors from Emperor Louis and from the Greeks concerning the controversy of Byzantine Iconoclasm. At first the iconoclast Eastern Roman Emperor Michael II showed himself tolerant towards the icon worshippers, and their great champion, Theodore the Studite, wrote to him to exhort him &quot;to unite us (the Church of Constantinople) to the head of the Churches of God, Rome, and through it with the three patriarchs&quot; and to refer any doubtful points to the decision of Old Rome in accordance with ancient custom. But Michael soon forgot his tolerance, bitterly persecuted the icon worshippers, and endeavoured to secure the co-operation of Louis the Pious. He also sent envoys to the pope to consult him on certain points connected with the worship of icons. Before taking any steps to meet the wishes of Michael, Louis asked the pope&#x27;s permission for a number of his bishops to assemble and make a selection of passages from the Fathers to elucidate the question that the Greeks had put before them. The leave was granted, but the bishops who met at Paris in 825 were incompetent for the task. Their collection of extracts from the Fathers was a mass of confused and ill-digested lore, and both their conclusions and the letters they wished the pope to forward to the Greeks were based on a complete misunderstanding of the decrees of the Second Council of Nicaea. Their labours do not appear to have accomplished much; nothing is known of the result of their researches.

In 826 Eugene held an important council at Rome of 62 bishops, in which 38 disciplinary decrees were issued. The council passed several enactments for the restoration of church discipline, and took measures for the foundation of schools or chapters. The decrees are noteworthy as showing that Eugene had at heart the advancement of learning. Not only were ignorant bishops and priests to be suspended till they had acquired sufficient learning to perform their sacred duties, but it was decreed that, as in some localities there were neither masters nor zeal for learning, masters were to be attached to the episcopal palaces, cathedral churches and other places to give instruction in sacred and polite literature. It also ruled against priests wearing secular dress or engaging in secular occupations. Simony was forbidden. Eugene also adopted various provisions for the care of the poor, widows and orphans, and on that account received the name of &quot;father of the people&quot;.

To help in the work of the conversion of the North, Eugene wrote commending St. Ansgar, the Apostle of the Scandinavians, and his companions &quot;to all the sons of the Catholic Church&quot;.

== Death and legacy ==
Eugene II died on 27 August 827. It is supposed that he was buried in St. Peter&#x27;s in accordance with the custom of the time, even though there is no documentary record to confirm it. He was succeeded by Valentine, with whom he had been so close that rumours circulated that Eugene was Valentine&#x27;s father or lover.

Coins of Eugene II are extant bearing his name and that of Emperor Louis. As pope, Eugene beautified his ancient church of St. Sabina with mosaics and metalwork bearing his name that were still intact as late as the 16th century.

<text>Pope Eugene III (; c. 1080 – 8 July 1153), born Bernardo Pignatelli, or possibly Paganelli, called Bernardo da Pisa, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 15 February 1145 to his death in 1153. He was the first Cistercian to become pope. In response to the fall of Edessa to the Muslims in 1144, Eugene proclaimed the Second Crusade. The crusade failed to recapture Edessa, which was the first of many failures by the Christians in the crusades to recapture lands won in the First Crusade. He was beatified in 1872 by Pope Pius IX.

==Early life==
Bernardo was born in the vicinity of Pisa. Little is known about his origins and family except that he was son of a certain Godius. From the 16th century he is commonly identified as member of the family of Paganelli di Montemagno, which belonged to the Pisan aristocracy, but this has not been proven and contradicts earlier testimonies that suggest he was a man of rather humble origins. In 1106 he was a canon of the cathedral chapter in Pisa and from 1115 is attested as subdeacon. 1133–1138 he acted as &quot;vicedominus&quot; of the archdiocese of Pisa.

Between May 1134 and February 1137 he was ordained to the priesthood by Pope Innocent II, who resided at that time in Pisa. Under the influence of Bernard of Clairvaux he entered the Cistercian Order in the monastery of Clairvaux in 1138. A year later he returned to Italy as leader of the Cistercian community in Scandriglia. In Autumn 1140, Innocent II named him abbot of the monastery of S. Anastasio alle Tre Fontane outside Rome. Some chronicles indicate that he was also elevated to the College of Cardinals, but these testimonies probably resulted from a confusion because Bernardo is not attested as cardinal in any document and from the letter of Bernard of Clairvaux addressed to the cardinals shortly after his election it clearly appears that he was not a cardinal.

==Papal election==

Bernardo was elected pope on 15 February 1145, the same day as the death of his predecessor Lucius II. Lucius had unwisely decided to take the offensive against the Roman Senate and was killed by a &quot;heavy stone&quot; thrown at him during an attack on the Capitol. Bernardo took the pontifical name Eugene III. He was &quot;a simple character, gentle and retiring - not at all, men thought, the material of which Popes are made&quot;. He owed his elevation partly to the fact that no one was eager to accept an office the duties of which were at the time so difficult and dangerous and because the election was &quot;held on safe Frangipani territory&quot;.

Bernardo&#x27;s election was assisted by his being a pupil and friend of Bernard of Clairvaux, the most influential ecclesiastic of the Western Church and a strong promoter of the temporal authority of the popes. The choice did not have the approval of Bernard, however, who remonstrated against the election, writing to the entire Curia:&quot;May God forgive you what you have done! ... What reason or counsel, when the Supreme Pontiff was dead, made you rush upon a mere rustic, lay hands on him in his refuge, wrest from his hands the axe, pick or hoe, and raise him to a throne?&quot;Bernard was equally forthright in his views directly to Eugene, writing:&quot;Thus does the finger of God raise up the poor out of the dust and lift up the beggar from the dunghill that he may sit with princes and inherit the throne of glory.&quot;Despite these criticisms, Eugene seems to have borne no resentment against Bernard and his initial reaction, once the choice had been made, it has been claimed that Bernard took advantage of the very qualities in Eugene III that he had criticised so as virtually to rule in the pope&#x27;s name.

For their part, the cardinals resented Bernard&#x27;s influence over the pope, stating &quot;You should know that, having been elevated to the rule of entire church by us, around whom, like pivots [&quot;cardines&quot;] the axis of the church universal swings, and having been made by us from a private person into the father of the universal church, it is necessary from now on that you belong not just to yourself but to us; that you do not rank particular and recent friendships before those which are general and of ancient standing&quot;.

Bernard reacted strongly to the cardinals&#x27; assertions, writing to Pope Eugenius that the cardinals had &quot;no power except that which you grant them or permit them to exercise&quot; and that their claims &quot;make no sense... [are] derived from no tradition... [and] had the support of authority&quot;.

The issue remained unresolved for the whole of Eugenius&#x27; pontificate.

==Pontificate==

During nearly the whole of his pontificate, Eugene III was unable to reside in Rome. Hardly had he left the city to be consecrated in the Farfa Abbey (about 40 km north of Rome), when the citizens, under the influence of Arnold of Brescia, the great opponent of the Pope&#x27;s temporal power, established the old Roman constitution, the Commune of Rome and elected Giordano Pierleoni to be patrician. Eugene III appealed for help to Tivoli, Italy, to other cities at feud with Rome, and to King Roger II of Sicily (who sent his general Robert of Selby), and with their aid was successful in making such conditions with the Roman citizens as enabled him for a time to hold the semblance of authority in his capital. But as he would not agree to a treacherous compact against Tivoli, he was compelled to leave the city in March 1146. He stayed for some time at Viterbo, and then at Siena, but went ultimately to France.

On hearing of the fall of Edessa (now the modern day city of Urfa, the first of the Crusader states established in the Levant) to the Turks, which occurred in 1144, he had, in December 1145, addressed the bull &quot;Quantum praedecessores&quot; to Louis VII of France, calling on him to take part in another crusade. Earlier the same year, Eugenius issued the Militia Dei, allowing the Templar Order to charge tithes and fees for burials. At a great diet held at Speyer in 1146, King Conrad III of Germany and many of his nobles were also incited to dedicate themselves to the crusade by the eloquence of Bernard of Clairvaux, preached to an enormous crowd at Vézelay. The Second Crusade turned out to be &quot;an ignominious fiasco&quot; and, after travelling for a year, the army abandoned their campaign after just five days of siege &quot;having regained not one inch of Muslim territory.&quot; The crusaders suffered immense losses in both men and materiel and suffered, in the view of one modern historian, &quot;the ultimate humiliation which neither they, nor their enemies, would forget&quot;.

Eugene III held synods in northern Europe at Paris, Rheims (March 1148), and Trier in 1147 that were devoted to the reform of clerical life. He also considered and approved the works of Hildegard of Bingen.
In June 1148, Eugene III returned to Italy and took up his residence at Viterbo. He was unable to return to Rome due to the popularity of Arnold of Brescia, who opposed papal temporal authority, in the city. He established himself at Ptolemy II&#x27;s fortress in Tusculum, the closest town to Rome at which he could safely install himself, on 8 April 1149. There he met the returning Crusader couple Louis VII of France and Eleanor of Aquitaine, who were by then barely on speaking terms given the strains of the failed Crusade and the rumors of Eleanor&#x27;s incestuous adultery during the Crusade. Eugene, &quot;a gentle, kind-hearted man who hated to see people unhappy&quot; attempted to assuage the pain of the failed Crusade and their failing marriage by insisting that they slept in the same bed and &quot;by daily converse to restore the love between them&quot;. His efforts were unsuccessful, and two years later Eugene agreed to annul the marriage on the grounds of consanguinity.

Eugene stayed at Tusculum until 7 November. At the end of November 1149, through the aid of the king of Sicily, he was again able to enter Rome, but the atmosphere of open hostility from the Comune soon compelled him to retire (June 1150). Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa promised to aid Eugene against his subjects who had revolted but the support never came. Eugene III died at Tivoli on 8 July 1153. Though the citizens of Rome resented Eugene III&#x27;s effort to assert his temporal authority, they recognized him as their spiritual lord. Until the day of his death he continued to wear the coarse habit of a Cistercian monk under his robe. He was buried in the Vatican with every mark of respect.

==Veneration==

The people of Rome were quick to recognize Eugene III as a pious figure who was meek and spiritual. His tomb acquired considerable fame owing to the miracle purported to have occurred there and his cause for sainthood commenced. Pope Pius IX beatified him in 1872.

<text>A plaintiff ([[pi (letter)|Π]] in legal shorthand) is the party who initiates a lawsuit (also known as an &quot;action&quot;) before a court. By doing so, the plaintiff seeks a legal remedy. If this search is successful, the court will issue judgment in favor of the plaintiff and make the appropriate court order (e.g., an order for damages). Plaintiff is the term used in civil cases in most English-speaking jurisdictions, the notable exceptions being England and Wales, where a plaintiff has, since the introduction of the Civil Procedure Rules in 1999, been known as a &quot;claimant&quot; and Scotland, where the party has always been known as the &quot;pursuer&quot;. In criminal cases, the prosecutor brings the case against the defendant, but the key complaining party is often called the &quot;complainant&quot;.

In some jurisdictions, a lawsuit is commenced by filing a summons, claim form or a complaint. These documents are known as pleadings, that set forth the alleged wrongs committed by the defendant or defendants with a demand for relief. In other jurisdictions, the action is commenced by service of legal process by delivery of these documents on the defendant by a process server; they are only filed with the court subsequently with an affidavit from the process server that they had been given to the defendant according to the rules of civil procedure.

==Terminology==
In most English-speaking jurisdictions, including Hong Kong, Nigeria, Australia (except in federal jurisdiction), Canada, the United States, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the legal term &quot;plaintiff&quot; is used as a general term for the party taking action in a civil case.

The word &quot;plaintiff&quot; can be traced to the year 1278, and stems from the Anglo-French word &quot;pleintif&quot; meaning &quot;complaining&quot;. It was identical to &quot;&quot; at first and receded into legal usage with the -iff spelling in the 15th century.

A plaintiff identified by name in a class action is called a named plaintiff.

In most common-law jurisdictions, the term &quot;claimant&quot; used in England and Wales since 1999 (see below) is used only in specific, often non-judicial contexts. In particular, in American usage, terms such as &quot;claimant&quot; and &quot;claim form&quot; are limited to extrajudicial process in insurance and administrative law. After exhausting remedies available through an insurer or government agency, an American claimant in need of further relief would turn to the courts, file a complaint (thus establishing a real court case under judicial supervision) and become a plaintiff.

In England and Wales, the term &quot;claimant&quot; replaced &quot;plaintiff&quot; after the Civil Procedure Rules came into force on 26 April 1999. The move, which brings England and Wales out of line with general usage in English-speaking jurisdictions, was reportedly based on an assessment that the word &quot;claimant&quot; is more acceptable as &quot;plain English&quot; than the word &quot;plaintiff&quot;. In Scottish law a plaintiff is referred to as a &quot;pursuer&quot; and a defendant as a &quot;defender&quot;.

The similar term &quot;complainant&quot; denotes the complaining witness in a criminal proceeding.

In the Federal Court of Australia, most plaintiffs are called &quot;applicants&quot;, but in admiralty and corporations law matters they are called &quot;plaintiffs&quot;.

==In case names==
Case names are usually given with the plaintiff first, as in &quot;Plaintiff v. Defendant&quot; (orally, &quot;Plaintiff and Defendant&quot;). The party against whom the complaint is made is the defendant; or, in the case of a petition, a respondent. Subsequent references to a case may use only one of the names, typically that of the first nongovernmental party.

Criminal cases are usually brought by the prosecution, not a plaintiff. The prosecution may bring the case formally in the name of the monarch, state or government. In many Commonwealth realms, this is the king (or queen, when the monarch is female), named &quot;the Crown,&quot; abbreviated &quot;R&quot;, thus &quot;R v Defendant&quot; (orally, &quot;R against (versus) Defendant&quot;). In several U.S. states, including California, Illinois, Michigan, and New York, the prosecution of a criminal case is captioned as &quot;The People of the State of&quot;, followed by the name of the state, or &quot;People&quot; for short.

<text>Personal property is property that is movable. In common law systems, personal property may also be called chattels or personalty. In civil law systems, personal property is often called movable property or movables—any property that can be moved from one location to another.

Personal property can be understood in comparison to real estate, immovable property or real property (such as land and buildings).

Movable property on land (larger livestock, for example) was not automatically sold with the land, it was &quot;personal&quot; to the owner and moved with the owner.

The word &quot;cattle&quot; is the Old Norman variant of Old French &quot;chatel&quot;, chattel, and today cheptel (derived from Latin &quot;capitalis&quot;, &quot;of the head&quot;), which was once synonymous with general movable personal property.

== Classifications ==
Personal property may be classified in a variety of ways.

=== Intangible ===
Intangible personal property or &quot;intangibles&quot; refers to personal property that cannot actually be moved, touched or felt, but instead represents something of value such as negotiable instruments, securities, service (economics), and intangible assets including chose in action.

=== Tangible ===
Tangible personal property refers to any type of property that can generally be moved (i.e., it is not attached to real property or land), touched or felt. These generally include items such as furniture, clothing, jewelry, art, writings, or household goods. In some cases, there can be formal title documents that show the ownership and transfer rights of that property after a person&#x27;s death (for example, motor vehicles, boats, etcetera) In many cases, however, tangible personal property will not be &quot;titled&quot; in an owner&#x27;s name and is presumed to be whatever property he or she was in possession of at the time of his or her death.

=== Other distinctions ===
Accountants distinguish personal property from real property because personal property can be depreciated faster than improvements (while land is not depreciable at all). It is an owner&#x27;s right to get tax benefits for chattel, and there are businesses that specialize in appraising personal property, or chattel.

The distinction between these types of property is significant for a variety of reasons. Usually, one&#x27;s rights on movables are more attenuated than one&#x27;s rights on immovables (or real property). The statutes of limitations or prescriptive periods are usually shorter when dealing with personal or movable property. Real property rights are usually enforceable for a much longer period of time and in most jurisdictions real estate and immovables are registered in government-sanctioned land registers. In some jurisdictions, rights (such as a lien or other security interest) can be registered against personal or movable property.

In common law it is possible to place a mortgage upon real property. Such a mortgage requires payment, or the owner of the mortgage can seek foreclosure. Personal property can often be secured with a similar kind of device, variously called a &quot;chattel mortgage&quot;, a &quot;trust receipt&quot;, or a &quot;security interest&quot;. In the United States, Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code governs the creation and enforcement of security interests in most (but not all) types of personal property.

There is no similar institution to the mortgage in the civil law, however a hypothec is a device to secure real rights against property. These real rights follow the property along with the ownership. In common law a lien also remains on the property, and it is not extinguished by alienation of the property; liens may be real or equitable.

Many jurisdictions levy a personal property tax, an annual tax on the privilege of owning or possessing personal property within the boundaries of the jurisdiction. Automobile and boat registration fees are a subset of this tax. Most household goods are exempt as long as they are kept or used within the household.

The distinction between tangible and intangible personal property is also significant in some of the jurisdictions which impose sales taxes. In Canada, for example, provincial and federal sales taxes were imposed primarily on sales of tangible personal property whereas sales of intangibles tended to be exempt. The move to value added taxes, under which almost all transactions are taxable, has diminished the significance of the distinction.

== Personal vis-à-vis private property ==
* Marxists argue that private property is a social relationship between the owner and persons deprived, i.e. not a relationship between person and thing. Private property may include artifacts, factories, mines, dams, infrastructure, natural vegetation, mountains, deserts, and seas these generate capital for the owner without the owner necessarily having to perform any physical labor. Conversely, those who perform labor using somebody else&#x27;s private property are considered deprived of the value of their work in Marxist theory, and are instead given a salary that is disjointed from the value generated by the worker.
* Personal property, or &quot;possessions&quot;, includes &quot;items intended for personal use&quot; (e.g., one&#x27;s toothbrush, clothes, and vehicles, and rarely, money). The owner has a distributive right to exclude others (i.e. the right to command a &quot;fair share&quot; of personal property).
* In anarchist theory, &quot;private property&quot; typically refers to capital or the means of production, whereas &quot;personal property&quot; refers to consumer and non-capital goods and services.

<doc id="24696" wikidata="Q837138" url="?curid=24696" title="Prima facie">
<text>Prima facie (; ) is a Latin expression meaning &quot;at first sight&quot;, or &quot;based on first impression&quot;. The literal translation would be &quot;at first face&quot; or &quot;at first appearance&quot;, from the feminine forms of &#x27; (&quot;first&quot;) and&#x27; (&quot;face&quot;), both in the ablative case. In modern, colloquial, and conversational English, a common translation would be &quot;on the face of it&quot;. 

The term &quot;prima facie&quot; is used in modern legal English (including both civil law and criminal law) to signify that upon initial examination, sufficient corroborating evidence appears to exist to support a case. In common law jurisdictions, a reference to &quot;prima facie evidence&quot; denotes evidence that, unless rebutted, would be sufficient to prove a particular proposition or fact. The term is used similarly in academic philosophy. Most legal proceedings, in most jurisdictions, require a &quot;prima facie&quot; case to exist, following which proceedings may then commence to test it, and create a ruling.

==Burden of proof==
In most legal proceedings, one party has a burden of proof, which requires it to present &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence for all of the essential facts in its case. If it cannot, its claim may be dismissed without any need for a response by other parties. A &quot;prima facie&quot; case might not stand or fall on its own; if an opposing party introduces other evidence or asserts an affirmative defense, it can be reconciled only with a full trial. Sometimes the introduction of &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence is informally called &quot;making a case&quot; or &quot;building a case&quot;. For example, in a trial under criminal law, the prosecution has the burden of presenting &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence of each element of the crime charged against the defendant. In a murder case, this would include evidence that the victim was in fact dead, that the defendant&#x27;s act caused the death, and that the defendant acted with malice aforethought. If no party introduces new evidence, the case stands or falls just by the &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence or lack thereof, respectively.

&quot;Prima facie&quot; evidence does not need to be conclusive or irrefutable: at this stage, evidence rebutting the case is not considered, only whether any party&#x27;s case has enough merit to take it to a full trial. In common law jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and the United States, the prosecution in a criminal trial must disclose all evidence to the defense. This includes the &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence. An aim of the doctrine of &quot;prima facie&quot; is to prevent litigants from bringing spurious charges which simply waste all other parties&#x27; time.

==&quot;Res ipsa loquitur&quot;==
&quot;Prima facie&quot; is often confused with &quot;res ipsa loquitur&quot; (&#x27;the thing speaks for itself&#x27;, or literally &#x27;the thing itself speaks&#x27;), the common law doctrine that when the facts make it self-evident that negligence or other responsibility lies with a party, it is not necessary to provide extraneous details, since any reasonable person would immediately find the facts of the case. The difference between the two is that &quot;prima facie&quot; is a term meaning there is enough evidence for there to be a case to answer, while &quot;res ipsa loquitur&quot; means that the facts are so obvious a party does not need to explain any more. For example: &quot;There is a &quot;prima facie&quot; case that the defendant is liable. They controlled the pump. The pump was left on and flooded the plaintiff&#x27;s house. The plaintiff was away and had left the house in the control of the defendant. &quot;Res ipsa loquitur&quot;.&quot; In Canadian tort law, this doctrine has been subsumed by general negligence law.

==Use in academic philosophy==

The phrase is also used in academic philosophy. Among its most notable uses is in the theory of ethics first proposed by W. D. Ross in his 1930 book &quot;The Right and the Good&quot;, often called the &quot;Ethic of Prima Facie Duties&quot;, as well as in epistemology, as used, for example, by Robert Audi. It is generally used in reference to an obligation. &quot;I have a &quot;prima facie&quot; obligation to keep my promise and meet my friend&quot; means that I am under an obligation, but this may yield to a more pressing duty. A more modern usage prefers the title &quot;pro tanto obligation&quot;: an obligation that may be later overruled by another more pressing one; it exists only &quot;pro tempore&quot;.

==Other uses and references==
The phrase &quot;prima facie&quot; is sometimes misspelled &#x27; in the mistaken belief that &#x27; is the actual Latin word; however, &quot;faciē&quot; is in fact the ablative case of &quot;faciēs&quot;, a fifth declension Latin noun. In policy debate theory, &quot;prima facie&quot; is used to describe the mandates or planks of an affirmative case, or, in some rare cases, a negative counterplan. When the negative team appeals to &quot;prima facie&quot;, it appeals to the fact that the affirmative team cannot add or amend anything in its plan after being stated in the first affirmative constructive.

A common usage of the phrase is the concept of a &quot;&quot;prima facie&quot; speed limit&quot;, which has been used in Australia and the United States. A &quot;prima facie&quot; speed limit is a default speed limit that applies when no other specific speed limit is posted, and may be exceeded by a driver; however, if the driver is detected, and cited by police for exceeding the limit, the onus of proof is on the driver to show that the speed at which the driver was travelling was safe under the circumstances. In most jurisdictions, this type of speed limit has been replaced by absolute speed limits.

<text>Product liability is the area of law in which manufacturers, distributors, suppliers, retailers, and others who make products available to the public are held responsible for the injuries those products cause. Although the word &quot;product&quot; has broad connotations, product liability as an area of law is traditionally limited to products in the form of tangible personal property.

==Product liability by country==

The overwhelming majority of countries have strongly preferred to address product liability through legislative means. In most countries, this occurred either by enacting a separate product liability act, adding product liability rules to an existing civil code, or including strict liability within a comprehensive Consumer Protection Act. In the United States, product liability law was developed primarily through case law from state courts as well as the &quot;Restatements of the Law&quot; produced by the American Law Institute (ALI).

The United States and the European Union&#x27;s product liability regimes are the two leading models for how to impose strict liability for defective products, meaning that &quot;[v]irtually every product liability regime in the world follows one of these two models.&quot;

===United States===

The United States was the birthplace of modern product liability law during the 20th century, due to the 1963 &quot;Greenman&quot; decision which led to the emergence of product liability as a distinct field of private law. In 1993, it was reported that &quot;[n]o other country can match the United States for the number and diversity of its product liability cases, nor for the prominence of the subject in the eyes of the general public and legal practitioners.&quot; This was still true as of 2015: &quot;In the United States, product liability continues to play a big role: litigation is much more frequent there than anywhere else in the world, awards are higher, and publicity is significant.&quot;

In the United States, the majority of product liability laws are determined at the state level and vary widely from state to state. Each type of product liability claim requires proof of different elements in order to present a valid claim.

====History====
For a variety of complex historical reasons beyond the scope of this article, personal injury lawsuits in tort for monetary damages were virtually nonexistent before the Second Industrial Revolution of the 19th century. As a subset of personal injury cases, product liability cases were extraordinarily rare, but it appears that in the few that were brought, the general rule at early common law was probably what modern observers would call no-fault or strict liability. In other words, the plaintiff only needed to prove causation and damages.

Common law courts began to shift towards a no-liability regime for products (except for cases of fraud or breach of express warranty) by developing the doctrine of &quot;caveat emptor&quot; (buyer beware) in the early 1600s. As personal injury and product liability claims began to slowly increase during the early First Industrial Revolution (due to increased mobility of both people and products), common law courts in both England and the United States in the 1840s erected further barriers to plaintiffs by requiring them to prove negligence on the part of the defendant (i.e., that the defendant was at fault because its conduct had failed to meet the standard of care expected of a reasonable person), and to overcome the defense of lack of privity of contract in cases where the plaintiff had not dealt directly with the manufacturer (as exemplified by &quot;Winterbottom v. Wright&quot; (1842)). During the Second Industrial Revolution of the mid-to-late 19th century, consumers increasingly became several steps removed from the original manufacturers of products and the unjust effects of all these doctrines became widely evident.

State courts in the United States began to look for ways to ameliorate the harsh effects of such legal doctrines, as did the British Parliament. For example, one method was to find implied warranties implicit in the nature of certain contracts; by the end of the 19th century, enough U.S. states had adopted an implied warranty of merchantable quality that this warranty was restated in statutory form in the U.S. Uniform Sales Act of 1906, which drew inspiration from the British Sale of Goods Act 1893.

During the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, American law professors Fleming James Jr. and William Prosser published competing visions for the future of the nascent field of product liability. James acknowledged that traditional negligence and warranty law were inadequate solutions for the problems presented by defective products, but argued in 1955 those issues could be resolved by a modification of warranty law &quot;tailored to meet modern needs,&quot; while Prosser argued in 1960 that strict liability in tort ought to be &quot;declared outright&quot; without &quot;an illusory contract mask.&quot; Ultimately, it was Prosser&#x27;s view which prevailed.

=====Landmark legal cases=====

The first step towards modern product liability law occurred in the landmark New York case of &quot;MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.&quot; (1916), which demolished the privity bar to recovery in negligence actions. By 1955, James was citing &quot;MacPherson&quot; to argue that &quot;[t]he citadel of privity has crumbled,&quot; although Maine, the last holdout, would not adopt &quot;MacPherson&quot; until 1982.

The second step was the landmark New Jersey case of &quot;Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc.&quot; (1960), which demolished the privity bar to recovery in actions for breach of implied warranty. Prosser cited &quot;Henningsen&quot; in 1960 as the &quot;fall of the citadel of privity.&quot; The &quot;Henningsen&quot; court helped articulate the rationale for the imminent shift from breach of warranty (sounding in contract) to strict liability (sounding in tort) as the dominant theory in product liability cases, but did not actually impose strict liability for defective products.

The third step was the landmark California case of &quot;Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.&quot; (1963), in which the Supreme Court of California openly articulated and adopted the doctrine of strict liability in tort for defective products. &quot;Greenman&quot; heralded a fundamental shift in how Americans thought about product liability towards a theory of enterprise liability—instead of basing liability on the defendant&#x27;s &quot;fault&quot; or &quot;warranty&quot;, the defendant&#x27;s liability should be predicated, as a matter of public policy, on the simple question of whether it was part of a business enterprise responsible for inflicting injuries on human beings. The theoretical foundation for enterprise liability had been laid by James as well as another law professor, Leon Green. As noted above, it was &quot;Greenman&quot; which led to the actual emergence of product liability as a distinct field of private law in its own right. Before this point, products had appeared in case law and scholarly literature only in connection with the application of existing doctrines in contract and tort.

The &quot;Greenman&quot; majority opinion was authored by then-Associate Justice Roger J. Traynor, who cited to his own earlier concurring opinion in &quot;Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co.&quot; (1944). In &quot;Escola&quot;, now also widely recognized as a landmark case, Justice Traynor laid the foundation for &quot;Greenman&quot; with these words:

Even if there is no negligence, however, public policy demands that responsibility be fixed wherever it will most effectively reduce the hazards to life and health inherent in defective products that reach the market. It is evident that the manufacturer can anticipate some hazards and guard against the recurrence of others, as the public cannot. Those who suffer injury from defective products are unprepared to meet its consequences. The cost of an injury and the loss of time or health may be an overwhelming misfortune to the person injured, and a needless one, for the risk of injury can be insured by the manufacturer and distributed among the public as a cost of doing business. It is to the public interest to discourage the marketing of products having defects that are a menace to the public. If such products nevertheless find their way into the market it is to the public interest to place the responsibility for whatever injury they may cause upon the manufacturer, who, even if he is not negligent in the manufacture of the product, is responsible for its reaching the market. However intermittently such injuries may occur and however haphazardly they may strike, the risk of their occurrence is a constant risk and a general one. Against such a risk there should be general and constant protection and the manufacturer is best situated to afford such protection.

Traynor&#x27;s argument for imposing strict liability in &quot;Escola&quot; &quot;has had an enormous impact on the way legal scholars have understood products liability and tort law more generally&quot;. The year after &quot;Greenman&quot;, the Supreme Court of California proceeded to extend strict liability to &quot;all&quot; parties involved in the manufacturing, distribution, and sale of defective products (including retailers). In 1969, the court then held that such defendants were liable not only to direct customers and users, but also to any innocent bystanders randomly injured by defective products.

=====Nationwide adoption of product liability=====

In turn, Prosser was able to propagate the &quot;Greenman&quot; holding to a nationwide audience because the American Law Institute had appointed him as the official reporter of the Restatement of Torts, Second. The Institute approved the Restatement&#x27;s final draft in 1964 and published it in 1965; the Restatement codified the &quot;Greenman&quot; doctrine in Section 402A. &quot;Greenman&quot; and Section 402A &quot;spread like wildfire across America&quot;. The highest courts of nearly all U.S. states and territories (and a few state legislatures) embraced this &quot;bold new doctrine&quot; during the late 1960s and 1970s. As of 2018, the five exceptions who have rejected strict liability are Delaware, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, and Virginia. In four of those states, warranty law has been so broadly construed in favor of plaintiffs that only North Carolina truly lacks anything resembling strict liability in tort for defective products. (North Carolina&#x27;s judiciary never attempted to adopt the doctrine, and the state legislature enacted a statute expressly banning strict liability for defective products in 1995.) In a landmark 1986 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court also embraced strict liability for defective products by adopting it as part of federal admiralty law.

=====Factors behind nationwide adoption=====

In the conventional narrative, there are two main factors that explain the rapid embrace of &quot;Greenman&quot; and Section 402A. First, they came along just as Americans were coalescing around a consensus in favor of consumer protection, which would eventually cause Congress to enact several landmark federal product safety and vehicle safety statutes. Between 1960 and 1977, Congress passed at least forty-two laws dealing with consumer and worker safety. Second, American academic experts in the field of law and economics developed new theories that helped to justify strict liability, such as those articulated by Guido Calabresi in &quot;The Costs of Accidents&quot; (1970).

To this, Kyle Graham adds three more factors: (3) the rise of attorneys specializing exclusively in plaintiffs&#x27; personal injury cases and their professional associations like the organization now known as the American Association for Justice; (4) the ubiquity of so-called &quot;bottle cases&quot; (personal injury cases arising from broken glass bottles) before aluminum cans and plastic bottles displaced glass bottles as the primary beverage container during the 1970s; and (5) the resistance of the Uniform Commercial Code&#x27;s editorial board to extending warranties to bystander victims before 1966—in states whose legislatures had not already acted, state courts were more receptive to extending the common law to grant bystanders a strict liability tort claim.

Prosser inexplicably imposed in Section 402A a requirement that a product defect must be &quot;unreasonably dangerous.&quot; Since the &quot;unreasonably dangerous&quot; qualifier implicitly connotes some sense of the idea of &quot;fault&quot; which Traynor was trying to exorcise from product liability, it was subsequently rejected as incompatible with strict liability for defective products by Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico and West Virginia.

=====The mass tort product liability explosion=====

Early proponents of strict liability believed its economic impact would be minor because they were focused on manufacturing defects. They failed to foresee the logical implications of applying the rule to other types of product defects. Only in the late 1960s did Americans begin to draw a clear analytical distinction between manufacturing and design defects, and since the early 1980s, defective design claims &quot;have formed the overwhelming bulk&quot; of American product liability lawsuits. It was &quot;the unintended application of [Section] 402A to the design context&quot; which resulted in the explosion of mass tort product liability cases during the 1980s throughout the United States. In the federal judicial system, the number of product liability civil actions filed per year increased from 2,393 in 1975 to 13,408 in 1989, and product liability&#x27;s percentage of all federal civil cases increased from 2.0% to 5.7% during the same period. These numbers reflect only a small portion of the 1980s explosion in product liability cases; the vast majority of American lawsuits are heard in state courts and not federal courts.

In subsequent decades, American federal judges began to heavily rely upon the multidistrict litigation (MDL) statute () to manage an ever-increasing number of complex civil cases. For the first time, by the end of 2018 more than half (51.9%) of all pending American federal civil cases had been centralized into MDLs, with 156,511 cases in 248 MDLs out of a total of 301,766 civil cases. Product liability was the dominant category both in terms of percentage of total active MDLs (32.9%) and percentage of total civil cases centralized into MDLs (91%).

Among the factors which led to the large numbers of product liability cases seen today in the United States are relatively low fees for filing lawsuits, the availability of class actions, the strongest right to a jury trial in the world, the highest awards of monetary damages in the world (frequently in the millions of dollars for pain and suffering noneconomic damages and in rare cases soaring into the billions for punitive damages), and the most extensive right to discovery in the world. No other country has adopted the U.S. standard of disclosure of information that is &quot;reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.&quot; American reported cases are replete with plaintiffs whose counsel artfully exploited this standard to obtain so-called &quot;smoking gun&quot; evidence of product defects and made defendants pay &quot;a tremendous price&quot; for their callous disregard for product safety.

=====Tort reform and the neo-conservative reaction=====

In response to these developments, a tort reform movement appeared in the 1980s which persuaded many state legislatures to enact various limitations like damage caps and statutes of repose. However, the majority of states left untouched the basic rule of strict liability for defective products, and all efforts at the federal level to enact a uniform federal product liability regime were unsuccessful.

From the mid-1960s onward, state courts struggled for over four decades to develop a coherent test for design defects, either phrased in terms of consumer expectations or whether risks outweigh benefits or both (i.e., a hybrid test in which the first does not apply to defects that are too complex). Risk-benefit analysis, of course, can be seen as a way of measuring the reasonableness of the defendant&#x27;s conduct—or in other words, negligence. A neo-conservative turn among many American courts and tort scholars during the 1980s led to a recognition that liability in design defect and failure-to-warn cases had never been entirely strict, or had been operating in some respects as a &quot;de facto&quot; fault-based regime all along, and the American Law Institute expressly backed a return to tests associated with negligence for design and warning defects with the 1998 publication of the &quot;Restatement of Torts, Third: Products Liability&quot;. This attempt to resurrect negligence and to limit strict liability to its original home in manufacturing defects &quot;has been highly controversial among courts and scholars.&quot; In arguing in 2018 that U.S. product liability law as restated in 1998 had come full circle back to where it started in 1964, two law professors also conceded that &quot;some courts&quot; continue to &quot;tenaciously cling[] to the rationale and doctrine of [Section] 402A.&quot;

====Types of liability====
Section 2 of the &quot;Restatement (Third) of Torts: Products Liability&quot; distinguishes between three major types of product liability claims:

* Manufacturing defect
* Design defect
* Failure to warn (also known as marketing defects)

However, in most states, these are not legal claims in and of themselves, but are pleaded in terms of the legal theories mentioned above. For example, a plaintiff might plead negligent failure to warn or strict liability for defective design.

The three types of product liability claims are defined as follows:

* Manufacturing defects are those that occur in the manufacturing process and usually involve poor-quality materials or shoddy workmanship. In other words, the defective product differs from the others on the same assembly line and does not conform to the manufacturer&#x27;s intended design.
* Design defects occur where the product design is inherently dangerous or useless (and hence defective) no matter how carefully manufactured. In other words, the defective product is the same as every other one on the same assembly line because it is exactly what the manufacturer designed and intended to build, but the plaintiff is contending that the design itself is defective. The Third Restatement expressly prefers to measure defective design in terms of whether the product design&#x27;s risks outweigh its benefits, and expressly deprecates the consumer expectations test associated with Section 402A of the Second Restatement. As noted above, state courts either use one test or the other or both. The Third Restatement also places the burden of proof on the plaintiff to prove that risks outweigh benefits by proving the feasibility of a safer alternative design. 
* Failure-to-warn defects arise in products that carry inherent nonobvious dangers which can be mitigated through adequate warnings to the user, and which are present regardless of how well the product is manufactured and designed for its intended purpose. This class of defects also includes failure to provide relevant product instructions or sufficient product warnings.

====Theories of liability====
In the United States, the claims most commonly associated with product liability are negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, and various consumer protection claims.

=====Breach of warranty=====
Warranties are statements by a manufacturer or seller concerning a product during a commercial transaction. Warranty claims historically required privity between the injured party and the manufacturer or seller; in plain English, they must be dealing directly with one another. As noted above, this requirement was demolished in the landmark &quot;Henningsen&quot; case.

Breach of warranty-based product liability claims usually focus on one of three types:
#Breach of an express warranty,
#Breach of an implied warranty of merchantability, and
#Breach of an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.
Express warranty claims focus on express statements by the manufacturer or the seller concerning the product (e.g., &quot;This chainsaw is useful to cut turkeys&quot;).

The various implied warranties cover those expectations common to all products (e.g., that a tool is not unreasonably dangerous when used for its proper purpose), unless specifically disclaimed by the manufacturer or the seller. They are implied by operation of law from the act of manufacturing, distributing, or selling the product. Claims involving real estate (especially mass-produced tract housing) may also be brought under a theory of implied warranty of habitability.

=====Negligence=====
A basic negligence claim consists of proof of

# a duty owed,
# a breach of that duty,
# the breach was the cause in fact of the plaintiff&#x27;s injury (actual cause)
# the breach proximately caused the plaintiff&#x27;s injury.
# and the plaintiff suffered actual quantifiable injury (damages).

As demonstrated in cases such as &quot;Winterbottom v. Wright&quot;, the scope of the duty of care was limited to those with whom one was in privity. Later cases like &quot;MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.&quot; broadened the duty of care to all who could be foreseeably injured by one&#x27;s conduct.

Over time, negligence concepts have arisen to deal with certain specific situations, including negligence &quot;per se&quot; (using a manufacturer&#x27;s violation of a law or regulation, in place of proof of a duty and a breach) and res ipsa loquitur (an inference of negligence under certain conditions).

=====Strict liability=====

Rather than focus on the behavior of the manufacturer (as in negligence), strict liability claims focus on the product itself. Under strict liability, the manufacturer is liable if the product is defective, even if the manufacturer was not negligent in making that product defective.

Under a strict liability theory, the plaintiff merely needs to prove:

*the defendant manufactured, distributed, or supplied a product;
*the product was defective;
*the defect caused injury to the plaintiff; and 
*as a result, the plaintiff sustained damages.

=====Consumer protection=====
In addition to common law remedies, many states have enacted consumer protection statutes that provide specific remedies for certain specific types of product defects. One reason for the appearance of such statutes is that under the &quot;economic loss rule&quot;, strict liability in tort is unavailable for products that cause damage only to themselves. In other words, strict liability is unavailable for defects that merely render the product unusable (or less useful), and hence cause only economic injury, but do not cause personal injury or damage to other property. Breach of warranty actions governed by Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code also often fail to provide adequate remedies in such situations.

The best-known examples of consumer protection statutes for product defects are lemon laws, which provide protection to purchasers of defective new vehicles and, in a small number of states, used vehicles. In the United States, &quot;cars are typically the second most valuable asset most people own, outranked only by their home.&quot;

===Europe===

Although European observers followed &quot;Greenman&quot; and Section 402A &quot;with great interest&quot;, European countries did not initially adopt such a doctrine. For example, after the landmark case of &quot;Donoghue v Stevenson&quot; [1932] (which followed &quot;MacPherson&quot;), UK product liability law did not change any further for many decades, despite &quot;trenchant academic criticism&quot;. Strict liability for defective products finally came to Europe as a result of the thalidomide scandal and the victims&#x27; ensuing struggle during the 1960s to obtain adequate compensation, especially in the UK and West Germany.

The thalidomide scandal highlighted the need for a strict product liability claim sounding in tort because the affected infants were mere bystander victims, as distinguished from product buyers or users. After the UK formed the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, 80% of pharmaceuticals were provided to patients through the NHS. By assuming financial responsibility for the provision of drugs, the government had thereby barred the majority of mothers (the actual product users) and their infants from bringing breach of warranty claims sounding in contract. For such victims, their only possible claim was a negligence claim sounding in tort, but it is so difficult under English law to prove the standard of care of a reasonable drug manufacturer that as of late 1993, none had ever been held liable in an English court under a negligence theory (although there had been a number of out-of-court settlements).

The first international effort in Europe to harmonize product liability resulted in the Council of Europe Convention on Products Liability in regard to Personal Injury and Death (the Strasbourg Convention) in 1977, which never entered into force: while it was signed by Austria, Belgium, France and Luxembourg, it was ratified by none of them.

On July 25, 1985, the then-European Economic Community adopted the Product Liability Directive. In language resembling what Traynor wrote in &quot;Escola&quot; and &quot;Greenman&quot;, the Directive&#x27;s preface states that &quot;liability without fault on the part of the producer is the sole means of adequately solving the problem, peculiar to our age of increasing technicality, of a fair apportionment of the risks inherent in modern technological production.&quot; The Directive gave each member state the option of imposing a liability cap of 70 million euros per defect. Unlike the United States, the Directive only imposed strict liability upon &quot;producers&quot;—that is, manufacturers of raw materials, component parts, and finished products, as well as importers—and deviated significantly from the American model by deciding not to impose strict liability on purely domestic distributors or retailers. By using the 20-year-old Section 402A as their model, the Directive&#x27;s drafters decided not to include a number of changes such as the subsequent differentiation between three major types of product defects used in the US.

As of 2003, on the one hand, product liability had expanded around the world within the past two decades to become a &quot;global phenomenon,&quot; and therefore, &quot;the United States is no longer the only country with tough product liability rules.&quot; On the other hand, the picture looked very different when one &quot;turn[ed] from the law on the books to the law in action.&quot; In the real world, the actual protection afforded to consumers by product liability law &quot;depends heavily on whether claims are realistically enforceable,&quot; and that depends upon whether the procedural law of the forum state is actually able to facilitate access to justice.

Traditionally, European courts have provided no discovery or rather minimal discovery (by American standards). Where available, European discovery is rarely self-executing (that is, automatically effective by operation of law), meaning that the defendant and third parties have no obligation to disclose anything unless and until the plaintiff obtains a court order. Civil law countries strongly dislike and oppose the American principle of broad discovery in civil litigation. For example, since 1968, it has been a crime for a French company to produce commercial information in foreign legal proceedings without express authorization from a French court, and in turn, this has been raised as a defense to discovery by French defendants in American product liability cases. Since the defendant usually possesses most of the extant evidence of a product defect, in most European countries it is &quot;very difficult, if not impossible, for a victim or her lawyer to investigate a product liability case.&quot;

Other obstacles—especially in civil law countries—include high filing fees, no right to a jury trial, low damages for pain and suffering, the unavailability of punitive damages, and the unavailability (before the 2010s) of class actions. As of 2003, there was &quot;no&quot; country outside of the United States where plaintiffs were able to recover noneconomic damages above US$300,000 for even the most catastrophic injuries. As of 2015, product liability in Europe &quot;has remained a fairly minor field which generates fewer cases, more modest awards, and rarely makes it into the headlines&quot; (in comparison to its American cousin). In July 2018, European Commission staff reported that from 2000 to 2016, a total of only 798 product liability claims had been filed in the national courts of EU member states. As of 2020, the much smaller number of cases in the UK meant that &quot;English case law ha[d] barely begun to consider&quot; many of the product liability issues already explored thoroughly by American courts, which therefore required an English legal treatise to cite to a &quot;significant proportion&quot; of American cases in order to illustrate where English product liability law could go in the future.

During the late 2010s, the comparative outcomes for consumers affected by the Volkswagen emissions scandal vividly highlighted the deficiencies of European civil procedure as applied to a defendant who had already publicly admitted to violations of U.S. environmental laws. In the United States, Volkswagen quickly settled the consolidated consumer class action and agreed to pay US$11.2 billion directly to consumers affected by its allegedly defective diesel vehicles. In contrast, consumers in Europe and elsewhere around the world had to fight much longer and harder for less compensation. Many of them were unimpressed with Volkswagen&#x27;s vigorous advocacy of legal defenses based on technical differences between different nations&#x27; environmental laws; from their perspective, they had paid for a &quot;clean diesel&quot; car, they did not get a &quot;clean diesel&quot; car, and did not understand why they deserved far less compensation than American consumers for what they perceived to be the same defect. This embarrassed Germany into dropping its longstanding opposition to European collective redress proposals, and the country also made reforms to its domestic civil procedure. As a result, on 25 November 2020, the European Parliament and Council adopted the Directive on Representative Actions. Paragraph 1 of Article 1 of the Directive states that it is intended &quot;to improve consumers&#x27; access to justice.&quot;

In 2024, Directive (EU) 2024/2853 on the liability for defective products repealed Council Directive 85/374/EEC and provided an expanded scope on product liability, now including components of products as well as software.

The legislatures of many other countries outside the EU (then: EEC) subsequently enacted strict liability regimes based on the European model (that is, generally applying only to manufacturers and importers), including Israel (March 1980, based on an early proposed draft of the Directive), Brazil (September 1990), Peru (November 1991), Australia (July 1992), Russia (February 1992), Switzerland (December 1992), Argentina (October 1993), Japan (June 1994), Taiwan (June 1994), Malaysia (August 1999), South Korea (January 2000), Thailand (December 2007), and South Africa (April 2009).

As of 2015, in most countries outside of the United States and European Union, &quot;product liability remains largely a regime of paper rules with little practical impact[.]&quot;

==Applicable law==
The law that needs to be applied in product liability cases is governed by the Convention on the Law Applicable to Products Liability of 1971 for the 11 countries that are party to it. The country where the damage occurred determines the applicable law, if that country is also the residence of the person suffering damage, the principal place of business of the person held liable or the place where the product was bought. If that is not the case, the law of the country of residence is used, provided the product was bought there, or it was the principal place of business of the person held liable.

==Debate over strict liability laws==
Advocates of strict liability laws argue that strict products liability causes manufacturers to internalize costs they would normally externalize. Strict liability thus requires manufacturers to evaluate the full costs of their products. In this way, strict liability provides a mechanism for ensuring that a product&#x27;s absolute good outweighs its absolute harm.

Between two parties who are not negligent (manufacturer and consumer), one will necessarily shoulder the costs of product defects. Proponents say it is preferable to place the economic costs on the manufacturer because it can better absorb them and pass them on to other consumers. The manufacturer thus becomes a de facto insurer against its defective products, with premiums built into the product&#x27;s price.

Strict liability also seeks to diminish the impact of information asymmetry between manufacturers and consumers. Manufacturers have better knowledge of their own products&#x27; dangers than do consumers. Therefore, manufacturers properly bear the burden of finding, correcting, and warning consumers of those dangers.

Strict liability reduces litigation costs, because a plaintiff need only prove causation, not imprudence. Where causation is easy to establish, parties to a strict liability suit will most likely settle, because only damages are in dispute.

Critics charge that strict liability creates risk of moral hazard. They claim that strict liability causes consumers to under invest in care even when they are the least-cost avoiders. This, they say, results in a lower aggregate level of care than under a negligence standard. Proponents counter that people have enough natural incentive to avoid inflicting serious harm on themselves to mitigate this concern.

Critics charge that the requiring manufacturers to internalize costs they would otherwise externalize increases the price of goods. Critics claim that in elastic, price-sensitive markets, price increases cause some consumers to seek substitutes for that product. As a result, they say, manufacturers may not produce the socially optimal level of goods. Proponents respond that these consumer opt outs reflect a product whose absolute harm outweighs its absolute value; products that do more harm than good ought not be produced.

In the law and economics literature, there is a debate about whether liability and regulation are substitutes or complements. If they are substitutes, then either liability or regulation should be used. If they are complements, then the joint use of liability and regulation is optimal.

<text>In law and insurance, a proximate cause is an event sufficiently related to an injury that the courts deem the event to be the cause of that injury. There are two types of causation in the law: cause-in-fact, and proximate (or legal) cause. Cause-in-fact is determined by the &quot;but for&quot; test: But for the action, the result would not have happened. (For example, but for running the red light, the collision would not have occurred.) The action is a necessary condition, but may not be a sufficient condition, for the resulting injury. A few circumstances exist where the but-for test is ineffective (see But-for test below). Since but-for causation is very easy to show (but for stopping to tie your shoe, you would not have missed the train and would not have been mugged), a second test is used to determine if an action is close enough to a harm in a &quot;chain of events&quot; to be legally valid. This test is called proximate cause. Proximate cause is a key principle of insurance and is concerned with how the loss or damage actually occurred. There are several competing theories of proximate cause (see Other factors). For an act to be deemed to cause a harm, both tests must be met; proximate cause is a legal limitation on cause-in-fact.

The formal Latin term for &quot;but for&quot; (cause-in-fact) causation, is sine qua non causation.

==But-for test==
A few circumstances exist where the &quot;but for&quot; test is complicated, or the test is ineffective. The primary examples are:
* Concurrent causes. Where two separate acts of negligence combine to cause an injury to a third party, each actor is liable. For example, a construction worker negligently leaves the cover off a manhole, and a careless driver negligently clips a pedestrian, forcing the pedestrian to fall into the open manhole. Both the construction worker and the careless driver are equally liable for the injury to the pedestrian. This example obeys the but for test. The injury could have been avoided by the elimination of either act of negligence, thus each is a but for cause of the injury.
*Sufficient combined causes. Where an injury results from two separate acts of negligence, either of which would have been sufficient to cause the injury, both actors are liable. For example, two campers in different parts of the woods negligently leave their campfires unattended. A forest fire results, but the same amount of property damage would have resulted from either fire. Both campers are equally liable for all damage. A famous case establishing this principle in the United States is &quot;Corey v. Havener.&quot;
*In the United States, the rule of Summers v. Tice holds that where two parties have acted negligently, but only one causes an injury to a third party, the burden shifts to the negligent parties to prove that they were &quot;not&quot; the cause of the injury. In that case, two hunters negligently fired their shotguns in the direction of their guide, and a pellet lodged in his eye. Because it was impossible to tell which hunter fired the shot that caused the injury, the court held both hunters liable.
*Market share evidence. Injury or illness is occasioned by a fungible product made by all the manufacturers joined in a lawsuit. The injury or illness is due to a design hazard, with each having been found to have sold the same type of product in a manner that made it unreasonably dangerous, there is inability to identify the specific manufacturer of the product or products that brought about the Plaintiff&#x27;s injury or illness and there are enough manufacturers of the fungible product joined in the lawsuit, to represent a substantial share of the market. Any damages would then be divided according to the market share ratio.

Since but-for causation is very easy to show and does not assign culpability (but for the rain, you would not have crashed your carthe rain is not morally or legally culpable but still constitutes a cause), there is a second test used to determine if an action is close enough to a harm in a &quot;chain of events&quot; to be a legally culpable cause of the harm. This test is called proximate cause, from the Latin &quot;causa proxima.&quot; 

==Other factors==

There are several competing theories of proximate cause.

===Foreseeability===
The most common test of proximate cause under the American legal system is foreseeability. It determines if the harm resulting from an action could reasonably have been predicted. The test is used in most cases only in respect to the type of harm. It is foreseeable, for example, that throwing a baseball at someone could cause them a blunt-force injury. But proximate cause is still met if a thrown baseball misses the target and knocks a heavy object off a shelf behind them, which causes a blunt-force injury.

This is also known as the &quot;extraordinary in hindsight&quot; rule.

In the United Kingdom, a &quot;threefold test&quot; of foreseeability of damage, proximity of relationship and reasonableness was established in the case of Caparo v Dickman (1990) and adopted in the litigation between Lungowe and others and Vedanta Resources plc (Supreme Court ruling 2019).

===Direct causation===
Direct causation is a minority test, which addresses only the metaphysical concept of causation. It does not matter how foreseeable the result as long as what the negligent party&#x27;s physical activity can be tied to what actually happened. The main thrust of direct causation is that there are no intervening causes between an act and the resulting harm. An intervening cause has several requirements: it must 1) be independent of the original act, 2) be a voluntary human act or an abnormal natural event, and 3) occur in time between the original act and the harm.

Direct causation is the only theory that addresses only causation and does not take into account the culpability of the original actor.

===Risk enhancement/causal link===

The plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant&#x27;s action increased the risk that the particular harm suffered by the plaintiff would occur. If the action were repeated, the likelihood of the harm would correspondingly increase. This is also called foreseeable risk.

===Harm within the risk===

The harm within the risk (HWR) test determines whether the victim was among the class of persons who could foreseeably be harmed, and whether the harm was foreseeable within the class of risks. It is the strictest test of causation, made famous by Benjamin Cardozo in &quot;Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Co.&quot; case under New York state law.

The first element of the test is met if the injured person was a member of a class of people who could be expected to be put at risk of injury by the action. For example, a pedestrian, as an expected user of sidewalks, is among the class of people put at risk by driving on a sidewalk, whereas a driver who is distracted by another driver driving on the sidewalk, and consequently crashes into a utility pole, is not.

The HWR test is no longer much used, outside of New York law. When it is used, it is used to consider the class of people injured, not the type of harm. The main criticism of this test is that it is preeminently concerned with culpability, rather than actual causation.

===The &quot;Risk Rule&quot; ===
Referred to by the Reporters of the Second and Third Restatements of the Law of Torts as the &quot;scope-of-the-risk&quot; test, the term &quot;Risk Rule&quot; was coined by the University of Texas School of Law&#x27;s Dean Robert Keeton. The rule is that “[a]n actor’s liability is limited to those physical harms that result from the risks that made the actor’s conduct tortious.” Thus, the operative question is &quot;what were the particular risks that made an actor&#x27;s conduct negligent?&quot; If the injury suffered is not the result of one of those risks, there can be no recovery. Two examples will illustrate this principle:

* The classic example is that of a father who gives his child a loaded gun, which she carelessly drops upon the plaintiff&#x27;s foot, causing injury. The plaintiff argues that it is negligent to give a child a loaded gun and that such negligence caused the injury, but this argument fails, for the injury did not result from the risk that made the conduct negligent. The risk that made the conduct negligent was the risk of the child accidentally firing the gun; the harm suffered could just as easily have resulted from handing the child an unloaded gun.
* Another example familiar to law students is that of the restaurant owner who stores rat poison above the grill in his luncheonette. The story is that during the lunch rush, the can explodes, severely injuring the chef who is preparing food in the kitchen. The chef sues the owner for negligence. The chef may not recover. Storing rat poison above the grill was negligent because it involved the risk that the chef might inadvertently mistake it for a spice and use it as an ingredient in a recipe. The explosion of the container and subsequent injury to the chef was not what made the chosen storage space risky.

The notion is that it must be the risk associated with the negligence of the conduct that results in an injury, not some other risk invited by aspects of the conduct that in of themselves would not be negligent.

==Controversy==
The doctrine of proximate cause is notoriously confusing. The doctrine is phrased in the language of causation, but in most of the cases in which proximate cause is actively litigated, there is not much real dispute that the defendant but-for caused the plaintiff&#x27;s injury. The doctrine is actually used by judges in a somewhat arbitrary fashion to limit the scope of the defendant&#x27;s liability to a subset of the total class of potential plaintiffs who may have suffered some harm from the defendant&#x27;s actions.

For example, in the two famous &quot;Kinsman Transit&quot; cases from the 2nd Circuit (exercising admiralty jurisdiction over a New York incident), it was clear that mooring a boat improperly could lead to the risk of that boat drifting away and crashing into another boat, and that both boats could crash into a bridge, which collapsed and blocked the river, and in turn, the wreckage could flood the land adjacent to the river, as well as prevent any traffic from traversing the river until it had been cleared. But under proximate cause, the property owners adjacent to the river could sue (&quot;Kinsman I&quot;), but not the owners of the boats or cargoes which could not move until the river was reopened (&quot;Kinsman II&quot;).

Therefore, in the final version of the &quot;Restatement (Third), Torts: Liability for Physical and Emotional Harm&quot;, published in 2010, the American Law Institute argued that proximate cause should be replaced with scope of liability. Chapter 6 of the Restatement is titled &quot;Scope of Liability (Proximate Cause).&quot; It begins with a special note explaining the institute&#x27;s decision to reframe the concept in terms of &quot;scope of liability&quot; because it does not involve true causation, and to also include &quot;proximate cause&quot; in the chapter title in parentheses to help judges and lawyers understand the connection between the old and new terminology. The Institute added that it &quot;fervently hopes&quot; the parenthetical will be unnecessary in a future fourth Restatement of Torts.

==Efficient proximate cause==
A related doctrine is the insurance law doctrine of efficient proximate cause. Under this rule, in order to determine whether a loss resulted from a cause covered under an insurance policy, a court looks for the predominant cause which sets into motion the chain of events producing the loss, which may not necessarily be the &quot;last&quot; event that immediately preceded the loss. Many insurers have attempted to contract around efficient proximate cause through the use of &quot;anti-concurrent causation&quot; (ACC) clauses, under which if a covered cause and a noncovered cause join to cause a loss, the loss is not covered.

ACC clauses frequently come into play in jurisdictions where property insurance does not normally include flood insurance and expressly excludes coverage for floods. The classic example of how ACC clauses work is where a hurricane hits a building with wind and flood hazards &quot;at the same time.&quot; If the evidence later shows that the wind blew off a building&#x27;s roof and then water damage resulted only because there was no roof to prevent rain from entering, there would be coverage, but if the building was simultaneously flooded (i.e., because the rain caused a nearby body of water to rise or simply overwhelmed local sewers), an ACC clause would completely block coverage for the &quot;entire&quot; loss (even if the building owner could otherwise attribute damage to wind v. flood).

A minority of jurisdictions have ruled ACC clauses to be unenforceable as against public policy, but they are generally enforceable in the majority of jurisdictions.

<doc id="24702" wikidata="Q454" url="?curid=24702" title="Peace">
<text>Peace is a state of harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a societal sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. 

Promotion of peace is a core tenet of many philosophies, religions, and ideologies, many of which consider it a core tenant of their philosophy. Some examples are, faiths such as Buddhism and Islam, important figures like Gandhi, and throughout literature like &quot;Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch&quot; by Immanuel Kant, &quot;The Art of Peace&quot; by Morihei Ueshiba, or ideologies that strictly adhere to it such as Pacifism within a sociopolitical scope. It is a frequent subject of symbolism and features prominently in art and other cultural traditions.

The representation of peace has taken many shapes, with a variety of symbols pertaining to it based on culture, context, and history; each with their respective symbolism whose nature can be very complex. An example, being during post-violence, in contexts where intense emotions, these symbols can form to evoke unity and cooperation, described as to fill groups of people with pride and connection, yet the symbolism could also possibly form to convey oppression, hatred, or else.
As such, a universal definition for peace does not concretely exist but gets expanded and defined proactively based on context and culture, in which it can serve many meanings not particularly benevolent in its symbolism.

&quot;Psychological peace&quot; (such as peaceful thinking and emotions) is less relatively well-defined, yet perhaps a necessary precursor to establishing &quot;behavioural peace&quot;. Peaceful behaviour sometimes results from a &quot;peaceful inner disposition&quot;. It has been argued by some that inner qualities such as tranquility, patience, respect, compassion, kindness, self-control, courage, moderation, forgiveness, equanimity, and the ability to see the big picture can promote peace within an individual, regardless of the external circumstances of their life.

== Etymology ==

The term &#x27;peace&#x27; originates from the Anglo-French , and the Old French , meaning &quot;peace, reconciliation, silence, agreement&quot; (11th century). The Anglo-French term itself comes from the Latin , meaning &quot;peace, compact, agreement, treaty of peace, tranquility, absence of hostility, harmony.&quot;

The English word came into use in various personal greetings from as a translation of the Hebrew word , which, according to Jewish theology, comes from a Hebrew verb meaning &#x27;to be complete, whole&#x27;. Although &quot;peace&quot; is the usual translation, it is an incomplete one, because , which is also cognate with the Arabic , has multiple other meanings in addition to peace, including justice, good health, safety, well-being, prosperity, equity, security, good fortune, and friendliness, as well as simply the greetings, &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;goodbye&quot;.

On a personal level, peaceful behaviours are kind, considerate, respectful, just, and tolerant of others&#x27; beliefs and behaviors – tending to manifest goodwill. This understanding of peace can also pertain to an individual&#x27;s introspective sense or concept of her/himself, as in being &quot;at peace&quot; in one&#x27;s own mind, as found in European references from . The early English term is also used in the sense of &quot;quiet&quot;, reflecting calm, serene, and meditative approaches to family or group relationships that have an absence of quarreling, disturbances and agitation; but seek clarity of conversation, and tranquility.

In many languages, the word &#x27;peace&#x27; is also used as a greeting or a farewell, for example the Hawaiian word , as well as the Arabic word . In English the word peace is occasionally used as a farewell, especially for the dead, as in the phrases &quot;rest in peace&quot; or &quot;&quot;.

== History ==

Peace was forged through diplomacy in the form of royal marriages, both in the distant past and in modern times. Two early examples of royal marriages being used to establish diplomatic relations are Hermodike I, who married the king of Phrygia around 800 BCE, and Hermodike II, who married the king of Lydia around 600 BCE. Both marriages involved Greek princesses from the house of Agamemnon and kings from what is now Turkey. The marriages between the Greek princesses and the kings of Phrygia and Lydia had a significant impact on the region, leading to the transfer of important technological innovations from Anatolia to Greece. In particular, the Phrygians introduced the Greek alphabet, while the Lydians pioneered the use of coinage as a form of currency. Both inventions were rapidly adopted by surrounding nations through further trade and cooperation.

Peace has not always been achieved through peaceful means; in many cases, it has been enforced by the victors of war, often through the use of violence and coercion. In his work &quot;Agricola&quot;, the Roman historian Tacitus, writes passionately and critically about the greed and arrogance of the Roman Empire, portraying it as a ruthless and self-serving power. One, that Tacitus says is by the Caledonian chieftain Calgacus, ends with: &quot;&quot; (&quot;To ravage, to slaughter, to usurp under false titles, they call empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace.&quot; —Oxford Revised Translation).

Discussion of peace is therefore at the same time an inquiry into its form. Is it simply the absence of mass organized killing (war), or does peace require a particular morality and justice? (&quot;just peace&quot;).
Societal peace can be seen at least in two forms:
# A simple silence of arms, absence of war.
# Absence of war accompanied by particular requirements for the mutual settlement of relations, which are characterized by justice, mutual respect, respect for law, and good will.

Since 1945, the United Nations and the United Nations Security Council have operated under the aim to resolve conflicts without war. Nonetheless, nations have entered numerous military conflicts since then.

==Organizations and prizes==

=== United Nations ===

The United Nations (UN) is an international organization whose stated aims are to facilitate cooperation in international law, international security, economic development, social progress, human rights, and achieving world peace. The UN was founded in 1945 after World War II to replace the League of Nations, to stop wars between countries, and to provide a platform for dialogue.

After authorization by the Security Council, the UN sends peacekeepers to regions where armed conflict has recently ceased or paused to enforce the terms of peace agreements and to discourage combatants from resuming hostilities. Since the UN does not maintain its own military, peacekeeping forces are voluntarily provided by member states of the UN. The forces, also called the &quot;Blue Helmets&quot;, who enforce UN accords are awarded United Nations Medals, which are considered international decorations instead of military decorations. The peacekeeping force as a whole received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988.

===Police===
 
The obligation of the state to provide for domestic peace within its borders is usually charged to the police and other general domestic policing activities. The police are a constituted body of persons empowered by a state to enforce the law, to protect the lives, liberty and possessions of citizens, and to prevent crime and civil disorder. Their powers include the power of arrest and the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with the police forces of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from the military and other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. Police forces are usually public sector services, funded through taxes.

===National security===

The national security apparatus of a nation is responsible for providing peace and security against foreign threats and aggression. National security can be threatened by a range of factors, including actions by other states (such as military or cyber attacks), violent non-state actors (such as terrorist attacks), organized criminal groups (such as narcotic cartels), and natural disasters (such as floods and earthquakes). Systemic drivers of insecurity, which may be transnational, include economic inequality and marginalisation, political exclusion, climate change, and nuclear proliferation. In view of the wide range of risks, the preservation of peace and the security of a nation state have several dimensions, including economic security, energy security, physical security, environmental security, food security, border security, and cyber security. These dimensions correlate closely with elements of national power.

===League of Nations===
The principal forerunner of the United Nations was the League of Nations. It was created at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, and emerged from the advocacy of Woodrow Wilson and other idealists during World War I. The Covenant of the League of Nations was included in the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, and the League was based in Geneva until its dissolution as a result of World War II and replacement by the United Nations. The high hopes widely held for the League in the 1920s, for example amongst members of the League of Nations Union, gave way to widespread disillusion in the 1930s as the League struggled to respond to challenges from Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Japan.

The prominent scholar, Sir Alfred Eckhard Zimmern, who is widely regarded as one of the most influential intellectuals of the League of Nations, drew inspiration for his studies from the classics, along with other British scholars such as Gilbert Murray and Florence Stawell. This group of scholars is often referred to as the &quot;Greece and peace&quot; set, due to their shared interest in ancient Greek civilization and the promotion of peace.

The creation of the League of Nations, and the hope for informed public opinion on international issues (expressed for example by the Union for Democratic Control during World War I), also saw the creation after World War I of bodies dedicated to understanding international affairs, such as the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and the Royal Institute of International Affairs at Chatham House in London. At the same time, the academic study of international relations started to professionalise, with the creation of the first professorship of international politics, named for Woodrow Wilson, at Aberystwyth, Wales, in 1919.

===Olympic Games===
The late 19th century idealist advocacy of peace which led to the creation of the Nobel Peace Prize, the Rhodes Scholarships, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and ultimately the League of Nations, also saw the re-emergence of the ancient Olympic ideal. Led by Pierre de Coubertin, this culminated in the holding in 1896 of the first of the modern Olympic Games.

===Nobel Peace Prize===
Since 1901, the Nobel Peace Prize has been the world&#x27;s most prestigious honor given to individuals or organizations who have made significant contributions to peace. The prize is awarded by the Norwegian Nobel Committee, a group of five individuals chosen by the Norwegian parliament. Nominees for the prize come from around the world, and are often those who have worked to end conflict, protect human rights, or promote humanitarian efforts. It is awarded annually to internationally notable persons following the prize&#x27;s creation in the will of Alfred Nobel. According to Nobel&#x27;s will, the Peace Prize shall be awarded to the person who &quot;...shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses.&quot;

===Rhodes, Fulbright and Schwarzman scholarships===
In creating the Rhodes Scholarships for outstanding students from the United States, Germany and much of the British Empire, Cecil Rhodes wrote in 1901 that &#x27;the object is that an understanding between the three great powers will render war impossible and educational relations make the strongest tie&#x27;. This peace purpose of the Rhodes Scholarships was very prominent in the first half of the 20th century, and became prominent again in recent years under Warden of the Rhodes House Donald Markwell, a historian of thought about the causes of war and peace. This vision greatly influenced Senator J. William Fulbright in the goal of the Fulbright fellowships to promote international understanding and peace, and has guided many other international fellowship programs, including the Schwarzman Scholars to China created by Stephen A. Schwarzman in 2013.

===Gandhi Peace Prize===
The International Gandhi Peace Prize, named after Mahatma Gandhi, is awarded annually by the Government of India. It was launched as a tribute to the ideals espoused by Gandhi in 1995 on the occasion of the 125th anniversary of his birth. This is an annual award given to individuals and institutions for their contributions towards social, economic and political transformation through non-violence and other Gandhian methods. The award carries Rs. 10 million in cash, convertible in any currency in the world, a plaque and a citation. It is open to all persons regardless of nationality, race, creed or sex.

===Student Peace Prize===

The Student Peace Prize is awarded biennially to a student or a student organization that has made a significant contribution to promoting peace and human rights.

===Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize===

The Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize, is awarded annually &quot;in recognition of an individual&#x27;s or an organisation&#x27;s contribution for the advancement of the cause of peace&quot;. The prize was first launched in 2009 by the Ahmadiyya Muslim Peace Prize Committee under the directive of the caliph of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, Mirza Masroor Ahmad.

===Culture of Peace News Network===

The Culture of Peace News Network, otherwise known simply as CPNN, is a UN authorized interactive online news network, committed to supporting the global movement for a culture of peace.

===Sydney Peace Prize===
Every year in the first week of November, the Sydney Peace Foundation presents the Sydney Peace Prize. The Sydney Peace Prize is awarded to an organization or an individual whose life and work has demonstrated significant contributions to:
The achievement of peace with justice locally, nationally or internationally
The promotion and attainment of human rights
The philosophy, language and practice of non-violence

===Museums===

A peace museum is a museum that documents historical peace initiatives. Many provide advocacy programs for nonviolent conflict resolution. This may include conflicts at the personal, regional or international level.

Smaller institutions include the Randolph Bourne Institute, the McGill Middle East Program of Civil Society and Peace Building and the International Festival of Peace Poetry.

==Religious beliefs ==

Religious beliefs often seek to identify and address the basic problems of human life, including conflicts between, among, and within persons and societies. In ancient Greek-speaking areas, the virtue of peace was personified as the goddess Eirene, and in Latin-speaking areas as the goddess Pax. Her image was typically represented by ancient sculptors as a full-grown woman, usually with a horn of plenty and scepter and sometimes with a torch or olive leaves.
===Christianity===

Christians, who believe Jesus of Nazareth to be the Jewish Messiah called Christ (meaning Anointed One), interpret as a messianic prophecy of Jesus in which he is called the &quot;Prince of Peace&quot;. In the Gospel of Luke, Zechariah celebrates his son John: &quot;And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High; for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways, to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the forgiveness of their sins. By the tender mercy of our God, the dawn from on high will break upon us, to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.&quot;

As a testimony of peace, Peace Churches in the Anabaptist Christian tradition (such as the Mennonites and Quakers), as well Holiness Methodist Pacifists (such as the Immanuel Missionary Church), practice nonresistance and do not participate in warfare.

In the Catholic Church, numerous pontifical documents on the Holy Rosary document a continuity of views of the Popes to have confidence in the Holy Rosary as a means to foster peace. In the Encyclical &quot;Mense maio&quot;, 1965, in which he urged the practice of the Holy Rosary, and as reaffirmed in the encyclical &quot;Christi Matri&quot;, 1966, to implore peace, Pope Paul VI stated in the apostolic &quot;Recurrens mensis&quot;, October 1969, that the Rosary is a prayer that favors the great gift of peace.

===Hinduism===
Hindu texts contain the following passages:


===Buddhism===
Buddhists believe that peace is attained by ending pain and suffering. They regard pain and suffering is stemming from cravings (in the extreme, greed), aversions (fears), and delusions and suffering is attachments to outcomes. To eliminate such pain and suffering and achieve personal peace, followers in the path of the Buddha adhere to a set of teachings called the Four Noble Truths — a central tenet in Buddhist philosophy.

===Islam===
Islam derived from the root word which literally means peace. Quran states &quot;those who believe and whose hearts find comfort in the remembrance of Allah. Surely in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find comfort.&quot; and stated &quot;O believers! When you are told to make room in gatherings, then do so. Allah will make room for you ˹in His grace˺. And if you are told to rise, then do so. Allah will elevate those of you who are faithful, and ˹raise˺ those gifted with knowledge in rank. And Allah is All-Aware of what you do.&quot;

=== Judaism ===
The Judaic tradition associates God with peace, as evidenced by various principles and laws in Judaism.

, the biblical and modern Hebrew word for peace, is one of the names for God according to the Judaic law and tradition. For instance, in traditional Jewish law, individuals are prohibited from saying &quot;&quot; when they are in the bathroom as there is a prohibition on uttering any of God&#x27;s names in the bathroom, out of respect for the divine name.

Jewish liturgy and prayer is replete with prayers asking God to establish peace in the world. The שמונה עשרה, a key prayer in Judaism that is recited three times each day, concludes with a blessing for peace. The last blessing of the שמונה עשרה, also known as the Amida (&quot;standing&quot; as the prayer is said while standing), is focused on peace, beginning and ending with supplications for peace and blessings.

Peace is central to Judaism&#x27;s core principle of מָשִׁיחַ (&quot;messiah&quot;) which connotes a time of universal peace and abundance, a time where weapons will be turned into plowshares and lions will sleep with lambs. As it is written in the Book of Isaiah:


This last metaphor from Tanakh (Hebrew bible) symbolizes the peace by which a longed-for messianic age will be characterized, a peace in which natural enemies, the strong and the weak, predator and prey, will live in harmony.

Jews pray for the messianic age of peace every day in the מָשִׁיחַ, in addition to faith in the coming of the messianic age constituting one of the thirteen core principles of faith in Judaism, according to Maimonides.

==Ideological beliefs==

===Pacifism===
Pacifism is the categorical opposition to the behaviors of war or violence as a means of settling disputes or of gaining advantage. Pacifism covers a spectrum of views ranging from the belief that international disputes can and should all be resolved via peaceful behaviors; to calls for the abolition of various organizations which tend to institutionalize aggressive behaviors, such as the military, or arms manufacturers; to opposition to any organization of society that might rely in any way upon governmental force. Groups that sometimes oppose the governmental use of force include anarchists and libertarians. Absolute pacifism opposes violent behavior under all circumstance, including defense of self and others.

Pacifism may be based on moral principles (a deontological view) or pragmatism (a consequentialist view). Principled pacifism holds that all forms of violent behavior are inappropriate responses to conflict, and are morally wrong. Pragmatic pacifism holds that the costs of war and inter-personal violence are so substantial that better ways of resolving disputes must be found.

===Inner peace, meditation and prayerfulness===
Psychological or inner peace (i.e. peace of mind) refers to a state of being internally or spiritually at peace, with sufficient clarity of knowledge and understanding to remain calm in the face of apparent discord, stress and discomfort. Being internally &quot;at peace&quot; is considered to be a healthy playable mental state, a homeostasis of emotions and to be the opposite of feeling stressful, mentally anxious, or emotionally unstable. Within meditative traditions, the achievement of &quot;peace of mind&quot; is often associated with bliss and happiness.

Peace of mind, serenity, and calmness are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress. In some meditative traditions, inner peace is believed to be a state of consciousness or enlightenment that may be cultivated by various types of meditation, prayer, tai chi, yoga, or other various types of mental or physical disciplines. Many such practices refer to this peace as an experience of knowing oneself. An emphasis on finding inner peace is often associated with traditions such as Buddhism, Hinduism, and some traditional Christian contemplative practices such as monasticism, as well as with the New Age movement.

===Non-aggression principle===
The non-aggression principle asserts that aggression against an individual or an individual&#x27;s property is always an immoral violation of life, liberty, and property rights. Utilizing deceit instead of consent to achieve ends is also a violation of the Non-Aggression Principle. Therefore, under the framework of this principle, rape, murder, deception, involuntary taxation, government regulation, and other behaviors that initiate aggression against otherwise peaceful individuals are considered violations. This principle is most commonly adhered to by libertarians. A common elevator pitch for this principle is, &quot;Good ideas don&#x27;t require force.&quot;

===Satyagraha===
Satyagraha is a philosophy and practice of nonviolent resistance developed by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. He deployed satyagraha techniques in campaigns for Indian independence and also during his earlier struggles in South Africa.

The word &quot;satyagraha&quot; itself was coined through a public contest that Gandhi sponsored through the newspaper he published in South Africa, &quot;Indian Opinion&quot;, when he realized that neither the common, contemporary Hindu language nor the English language contained a word which fully expressed his own meanings and intentions when he talked about his nonviolent approaches to conflict. According to Gandhi&#x27;s autobiography, the contest winner was Maganlal Gandhi (presumably no relation), who submitted the entry &#x27;sadagraha&#x27;, which Gandhi then modified to &#x27;satyagraha&#x27;. Etymologically, this Hindic word means &#x27;truth-firmness&#x27;, and is commonly translated as &#x27;steadfastness in the truth&#x27; or &#x27;truth-force&#x27;.

Satyagraha theory also influenced Martin Luther King Jr., James Bevel, and others during the campaigns they led during the civil rights movement in the United States. The theory of satyagraha sees means and ends as inseparable. Therefore, it is contradictory to try to use violence to obtain peace. As Gandhi wrote: &quot;They say, &#x27;means are, after all, means&#x27;. I would say, &#x27;means are, after all, everything&#x27;. As the means so the end...&quot; A quote sometimes attributed to Gandhi, but also to A. J. Muste, sums it up: &quot;There is no way to peace; peace is the way&quot;.

==Theories==

Many different theories of &quot;peace&quot; exist in the world of peace studies, which involves the study of de-escalation, conflict transformation, disarmament, and cessation of violence. The definition of &quot;peace&quot; can vary with religion, culture, or subject of study.

===Balance of power===

The classical &quot;realist&quot; position is that the key to promoting order between states, and so of increasing the chances of peace, is the maintenance of a balance of power between states – a situation where no state is so dominant that it can &quot;lay down the law to the rest&quot;. Exponents of this view have included Metternich, Bismarck, Hans Morgenthau, and Henry Kissinger. A related approach – more in the tradition of Hugo Grotius than Thomas Hobbes – was articulated by the so-called &quot;English school of international relations theory&quot; such as Martin Wight in his book &quot;Power Politics&quot; (1946, 1978) and Hedley Bull in &quot;The Anarchical Society&quot; (1977).

As the maintenance of a balance of power could in some circumstances require a willingness to go to war, some critics saw the idea of a balance of power as promoting war rather than promoting peace. This was a radical critique of those supporters of the Allied and Associated Powers who justified entry into World War I on the grounds that it was necessary to preserve the balance of power in Europe from a German bid for hegemony.

In the second half of the 20th century, and especially during the Cold War, a particular form of balance of power – mutual nuclear deterrence – emerged as a widely held doctrine on the key to peace between the great powers. Critics argued that the development of nuclear stockpiles increased the chances of war rather than peace, and that the &quot;nuclear umbrella&quot; made it &quot;safe&quot; for smaller wars (e.g. the Vietnam War and the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia to end the Prague Spring), so making such wars more likely.

===Appeasement and deterrence===
Appeasement is a strategy to achieve peace by making political, material, or territorial concessions to an aggressive power. Deterrence is a strategy to achieve peace by using threats or limited force to dissuade an actor from escalating conflict, typically because the prospective attacker believes that the probability of success is low and the costs of attack are high.
=== Speaking truth to power ===

Speaking truth to power is a non-violent political tactic, employed by dissidents against the received wisdom or propaganda of governments they regard as oppressive, authoritarian or an ideocracy. Practitioners who have campaigned for a more just and truthful world have included Apollonius of Tyana, Vaclav Havel, Nelson Mandela, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Mahatma Gandhi, Bacha Khan, and the Dalai Lama.

The phrase originated with a pamphlet, &quot;Speak Truth to Power: a Quaker Search for an Alternative to Violence&quot;, published by the American Friends Service Committee in 1955. A contributor of the pamphlet&#x27;s contents was civil rights activist Bayard Rustin.

=== Free trade and interdependence ===

It was a central tenet of classical liberalism, for example among English liberal thinkers of the late 19th and early 20th century, that free trade promoted peace. For example, the Cambridge economist John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946) said that he was &quot;brought up&quot; on this idea and held it unquestioned until at least the 1920s. During the economic globalization in the decades leading up to World War I, writers such as Norman Angell argued that the growth of economic interdependence between the great powers made war between them futile and therefore unlikely. He made this argument in 1913. A year later Europe&#x27;s economically interconnected states were embroiled in what would later become known as the First World War.

=== Democratic peace theory ===

The democratic peace theory posits that democracy causes peace (between democracies) because of the accountability, institutions, values, and norms of democratic countries.

=== Territorial peace theory ===

The territorial peace theory posits that peace causes democracy because territorial wars between neighbor countries lead to authoritarian attitudes and disregard for democratic values. 
This theory is supported by historical studies showing that countries rarely become democratic until after their borders have been settled by territorial peace with neighbor countries.

=== War game ===
The &quot;Peace and War Game&quot; is an approach in game theory to understand the relationship between peace and conflicts.

The iterated game hypotheses was originally used by academic groups and computer simulations to study possible strategies of cooperation and aggression.

As peace makers became richer over time, it became clear that making war had greater costs than initially anticipated. One of the well studied strategies that acquired wealth more rapidly was based on Genghis Khan, i.e. a constant aggressor making war continually to gain resources. This led, in contrast, to the development of what&#x27;s known as the &quot;provokable nice guy strategy&quot;, a peace-maker until attacked, improved upon merely to win by occasional forgiveness even when attacked. By adding the results of all pairwise games for each player, one sees that multiple players gain wealth cooperating with each other while bleeding a constantly aggressive player.

=== Socialism and managed capitalism ===
Socialist, communist, and left-wing liberal writers of the 19th and 20th centuries (e.g., Lenin, J.A. Hobson, John Strachey) argued that capitalism caused war (e.g. through promoting imperial or other economic rivalries that lead to international conflict). This led some to argue that international socialism was the key to peace.

However, in response to such writers in the 1930s who argued that capitalism caused war, the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883–1946) argued that managed capitalism could promote peace. This involved international coordination of fiscal/monetary policies, an international monetary system that did not pit the interests of countries against each other, and a high degree of freedom of trade. These ideas underlay Keynes&#x27;s work during World War II that led to the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank at Bretton Woods in 1944, and later of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (subsequently the World Trade Organization).

===International organization and law===
One of the most influential theories of peace, especially since Woodrow Wilson led the creation of the League of Nations at the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, is that peace will be advanced if the intentional anarchy of states is replaced through the growth of international law promoted and enforced through international organizations such as the League of Nations, the United Nations, and other functional international organizations. One of the most important early exponents of this view was Alfred Eckhart Zimmern, for example in his 1936 book &quot;The League of Nations and the Rule of Law&quot;.

=== Trans-national solidarity ===
Many &quot;idealist&quot; thinkers about international relations – e.g. in the traditions of Kant and Karl Marx – have argued that the key to peace is the growth of some form of solidarity between peoples (or classes of people) spanning the lines of cleavage between nations or states that lead to war.

One version of this is the idea of promoting international understanding between nations through the international mobility of students – an idea most powerfully advanced by Cecil Rhodes in the creation of the Rhodes Scholarships, and his successors such as J. William Fulbright.

Another theory is that peace can be developed among countries on the basis of active management of water resources.

==Day==
World Peace Day, celebrated on 21 September, was founded as a day to recognize, honour and promote peace. It is commemorated each year by United Nations members.

==Studies, rankings, and periods==
===Peace and conflict studies===
&quot;Peace and conflict studies&quot; is an academic field which identifies and analyses violent and nonviolent behaviours, as well as the structural mechanisms attending violent and non-violent social conflicts. This is to better understand the processes leading to a more desirable human condition. One variation,
&quot;Peace studies&quot; (irenology), is an interdisciplinary effort aiming at the prevention, de-escalation, and solution of conflicts. This contrasts with war studies (polemology), directed at the efficient attainment of victory in conflicts. Disciplines involved may include political science, geography, economics, psychology, sociology, international relations, history, anthropology, religious studies, and gender studies, as well as a variety of other disciplines.

===Measurement and ranking===

Although peace is widely perceived as something intangible, various organizations have been making efforts to quantify and measure it. The Global Peace Index produced by the Institute for Economics and Peace is a known effort to evaluate peacefulness in countries based on 23 indicators of the absence of violence and absence of the fear of violence.

The 2015 edition of the Index ranked 163 countries on their internal and external levels of peace. According to the 2017 Global Peace Index, Iceland is the most peaceful country in the world while Syria is the least peaceful one. Fragile States Index (formerly known as the Failed States Index) created by the Fund for Peace focuses on risk for instability or violence in 178 nations. This index measures how fragile a state is by 12 indicators and subindicators that evaluate aspects of politics, social economy, and military facets in countries. The 2015 Failed State Index reports that the most fragile nation is South Sudan, and the least fragile one is Finland. University of Maryland publishes the Peace and Conflict Instability Ledger in order to measure peace. It grades 163 countries with 5 indicators, and pays the most attention to risk of political instability or armed conflict over a three-year period. The most recent ledger shows that the most peaceful country is Slovenia on the contrary Afghanistan is the most conflicted nation. Besides indicated above reports from the Institute for Economics and Peace, Fund for Peace, and University of Maryland, other organizations including George Mason University release indexes that rank countries in terms of peacefulness.

===Long periods===

The longest continuing period of peace and neutrality among currently existing states is observed in Sweden since 1814 and in Switzerland, which has had an official policy of neutrality since 1815. This was made possible partly by the periods of relative peace in Europe and the world known as Pax Britannica (1815–1914), Pax Europaea/Pax Americana (since 1950s), and Pax Atomica (also since the 1950s).

Other examples of long periods of peace are:
* the isolationistic Edo period (also known as Tokugawa shogunate) in Japan 1603 to 1868 (265 years)
* Pax Khazarica in Khazar Khanate (south-east Turkey) about (250 years)
* Pax Romana in the Roman empire (for 190 or 206 years).

<text>The Portland Vase is a Roman cameo glass vase, which is dated between AD 1 and AD 25, though low BC dates have some scholarly support. It is the best known piece of Roman cameo glass and has served as an inspiration to many glass and porcelain makers from about the beginning of the 18th century onwards. It was first recorded in Rome in 1600–1601, and since 1810 has been in the British Museum in London. The museum held it on loan from the dukes of Portland until 1945, and bought it from them that year (GR 1945,0927.1). It is normally on display in Room 70.

The vase measures about high and in diameter. It is made of violet-blue glass, and surrounded with a single continuous white glass cameo making two distinct scenes, depicting seven human figures, plus a large snake, and two bearded and horned heads below the handles, marking the break between the scenes.

The bottom of the vase was a cameo glass disc, also in blue and white, showing a head, presumed to be of Paris or Priam based on the Phrygian cap it wears. This roundel clearly does not belong to the vase and has been displayed separately since 1845. It may have been added in antiquity or later, or is the result of a conversion from an original amphora form (paralleled by a similar blue-glass cameo vessel from Pompeii). It was attached to the bottom from at least 1826.

==Iconography==
The meaning of the images on the vase is unclear, and none of the many theories put forward has been found generally satisfactory. They fall into two main groups: mythological and historical, though a historical interpretation of a myth is also a possibility. Historical interpretations focus on Augustus, his family and his rivals, especially given the quality and expense of the object, and the somewhat remote neo-classicism of the style, which compares with some Imperial gemstone cameos featuring Augustus and his family with divine attributes, such as the Gemma Augustea, the Great Cameo of France and the Blacas Cameo (the last also in the British Museum). Interpretations of the portrayals have included that of a marine setting (due to the presence of a ketos or sea-snake), and of a marriage theme/context, as the vase may have been a wedding gift. Many scholars (including Charles Towneley) have concluded that the figures do not fit into a single iconographic set.

===Scene 1===
Interpretations include:
* The marriage of mortal Peleus and the sea goddess Thetis, &quot;the most enduring mythological interpretation&quot;.
* Dionysos greeting Ariadne with her sacred serpent, in the sacred grove for their marriage, symbolized by Cupid with a nuptial torch, in the presence of his foster-father, Silenus
* The story of the Emperor Augustus&#x27; supposed siring by the god Apollo in the form of a snake 
* The younger man is Mark Antony being lured by the wiles of the reclining woman, Cleopatra VII (accompanied by an asp, the alleged type of venomous snake involved in the death of Cleopatra), into losing his manly romanitas and becoming decadent, with the bearded elder male figure being his mythical ancestor Anton looking on.
* The dream of Olympias, mother of Alexander the Great, who is emerging from the building to greet her, with his father Apollo as the serpent. This was the first theory, dating to 1633, and connected to Severus Alexander and his mother, &quot;of whom a similar tale of reptilian paternity was told&quot;.

===Scene 2===

Interpretations include:
* A divinatory dream by Hecuba that the Judgement of Paris would lead to the destruction of Troy
* Ariadne languishing on Naxos
* The woman languishing is Octavia Minor, abandoned by Mark Antony, between her brother Augustus (left, as a god, as on the contemporary Sword of Tiberius) and Venus Genetrix, the ancestor of Augustus and Octavia&#x27;s Julian gens.

====Octavian theory====

Another variant theory is that the vase dates back to circa 32 BC, and was commissioned by Octavian (later Caesar Augustus), as an attempt to promote his case against his fellow triumvirs, Mark Antony and Marcus Lepidus in the period after the death of Julius Caesar. It is based on the skill of the famous Greek carver of engraved gems Dioskourides, who is recorded as active and at his peak circa 40–15 BC and three of whose attributed cameos bear a close resemblance in line and quality to the Portland vase figures. This theory proposes that the first two figures are Gaius Octavius, father of the future emperor, and Atia, his mother (hence Cupid with the arrow) who had a dream of being impregnated by Apollo in the form of a sea serpent (ketos), note the snake&#x27;s prominent teeth. The onlooker with his staff, could be Aeneas, a hero of the Trojan Wars who saved his father by carrying him over his back (hence his hunched position, and his Trojan beard) and who is believed to have founded Rome, and from whom the Julian gens, including Julius Caesar and Attia, claimed descent, witnessing the conception of Rome&#x27;s future savior as an Empire, and the greatest of all the Emperors.

On the reverse is Octavian, Octavia his sister, widow of Mark Antony (downcast flambeau, broken tablets) and Livia, Octavian&#x27;s third wife who outlived him. These two are looking directly at each other. Octavian commanded she divorce her then husband and marry him with a few weeks of meeting, she was mother to the future Emperor Tiberius.

This vase suggests Octavian was descended partly from Apollo (thus partly divine, shades of Achilles), whom he worshiped as a god, gave private parties in his honor together with Minerva, Roman Goddess of War, from the founder of Rome, and his connection to his uncle Julius Caesar, for whom as a young man he gave a remarkable funeral oratory, and who adopted him on his father&#x27;s death, when he was only four. All the pieces and people fit in this theory and it explains most mysteries (apart from who actually made it). It would have been a fabulously expensive piece to commission, so that few men of the period could have afforded it. Several attempts at creating the vase must have been made, as modern reproduction trials show today (see below). Historians and archeologists dismiss this modern theory as gods and goddesses with mythical allegories were usually portrayed.

==Manufacture==
Cameo glass vessels were probably all made within about two generations, as experiments when the blowing technique (discovered in about 50 BC) was still in its infancy. Recent research suggests that the Portland Vase, like most cameo glass vessels, was made by the dip-overlay method, whereby an elongated bubble of glass was partially dipped into a crucible of white glass before the two were blown together. After cooling the white layer was cut away to form the design.

Making a 19th-century copy required painstaking work. This experience suggests that creation of the original Portland Vase required two years of work. Cutting was probably performed by a skilled gem-cutter, possibly Dioskourides. Engraved gems are extant which are of a similar period and are signed and thought to be cut by him (Vollenweider 1966, see Gem in the collection of the duke of Devonshire &quot;Diomedes stealing the Palladium&quot;). This is supported by the Corning Museum in their 190-page study of the vase.

According to a controversial theory by Rosemarie Lierke, the vase, along with the rest of Roman cameo glass, was moulded rather than cold-cut, probably using white glass powder for the white layer.

Jerome Eisenberg has argued in &quot;Minerva&quot; that the vase was produced in the 16th century AD and not in antiquity, because the iconography is incoherent, but this theory has not been widely accepted.

==Rediscovery and provenance==
One story suggests that it was discovered by Fabrizio Lazzaro in what was then thought to be the sarcophagus of the Emperor Alexander Severus (died 235) and his mother, at Monte del Grano near Rome, and excavated some time around 1582.

The first historical reference to the vase is in a letter of 1601 from the French scholar Nicolas Claude Fabri de Peiresc to the painter Peter Paul Rubens, where it is recorded as in the collection of Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte in Italy. In 1626, it passed into the Barberini family collection (which also included sculptures such as the &quot;Barberini Faun&quot; and &quot;Barberini Apollo&quot;) where it remained for some two hundred years, being one of the treasures of Maffeo Barberini, later Pope Urban VIII (1623–1644). It was at this point that the Severan connection is first recorded. The vase was known as the &quot;Barberini Vase&quot; in this period.

===1778 to present===
Between 1778 and 1780, Sir William Hamilton, British ambassador in Naples, bought the vase from James Byres, a Scottish art dealer, who had acquired it after it was sold by Cornelia Barberini-Colonna, Princess of Palestrina. She had inherited the vase from the Barberini family. Hamilton brought it to England on his next leave, after the death of his first wife, Catherine. In 1784, with the assistance of his niece, Mary, he arranged a private sale of the vase to Margaret Cavendish-Harley, Dowager Duchess of Portland. It was sold at auction in 1786 and passed into the possession of the duchess&#x27;s son, William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland.

The 3rd duke lent the original vase to Josiah Wedgwood and then to the British Museum for safe-keeping, by which point it was known as the &quot;Portland Vase&quot;. It was deposited there permanently by the fourth duke in 1810, after a friend of his broke its base. It has remained in the British Museum ever since 1810, apart from 1929 to 1932, when the 6th duke put it up for sale at Christie&#x27;s (where it failed to reach its reserve). It was finally purchased by the museum from the 7th duke in 1945 with the aid of a bequest from James Rose Vallentin.

====Copies====

The 3rd duke lent the vase to Josiah Wedgwood, who had already had it described to him by the sculptor John Flaxman as &quot;the finest production of Art that has been brought to England and seems to be the very apex of perfection to which you are endeavoring&quot;. Wedgwood devoted four years of painstaking trials at duplicating the vase – not in glass but in black and white jasperware. He had problems with his copies ranging from cracking and blistering (clearly visible on the example at the Victoria and Albert Museum) to the sprigged reliefs &#x27;lifting&#x27; during the firing, and in 1786 he feared that he could never apply the Jasper relief thinly enough to match the glass original&#x27;s subtlety and delicacy. He finally managed to perfect it in 1790, with the issue of the &quot;first-edition&quot; of copies (with some of this edition, including the V&amp;A one, copying the cameo&#x27;s delicacy by a combination of undercutting and shading the reliefs in grey), and it marks his last major achievement.

Wedgwood put the first edition on private show between April and May 1790, with that exhibition proving so popular that visitor numbers had to be restricted by only printing 1,900 tickets, before going on show in his public London showrooms. (One ticket to the private exhibition, illustrated by Samuel Alkin and printed with &quot;Admission to see Mr Wedgwood&#x27;s copy of The Portland Vase, Greek Street, Soho, between 12 o&#x27;clock and 5&quot;, was bound into the Wedgwood catalogue on view in the Victoria and Albert Museum&#x27;s British Galleries.) As well as the V&amp;A copy (said to have come from the collection of Wedgwood&#x27;s grandson, the naturalist Charles Darwin), others are held at the Fitzwilliam Museum (this is the copy sent by Wedgwood to Erasmus Darwin which his descendants lent to the Museum in 1963 and later sold to them); the Department of Britain, Europe and Prehistory at the British Museum, and the Indianapolis Museum of Art. The Auckland War Memorial Museum has a 19th-century jasperware facsimile in their collections. The soap magnate William Hesketh Lever, who has one of the finest collections of Wedgwood Jasperware in existence today, purchased two of Wedgwood&#x27;s Portland vases. One of them is on display in the Wedgwood rooms of the Lady Lever Art Gallery in Port Sunlight

The vase also inspired a 19th-century competition to duplicate its cameo-work in glass, with Benjamin Richardson offering a £1,000 prize to anyone who could achieve that feat. Taking three years, glass maker Philip Pargeter made a copy and John Northwood engraved it, to win the prize. This copy is in the Corning Museum of Glass in Corning, New York.

The Wedgwood Museum collection is now branded the V&amp;A Wedgwood Collection. Displays at Barlaston, near Stoke-on-Trent, are now branded World of Wedgwood and described on its website as “Home to Stoke-on-Trent&#x27;s most prestigious brand, Wedgwood”, and include the galleries of the V&amp;A Wedgwood Collection.

====Vandalism and reconstruction====
At 3:45 p.m. on 7 February 1845, the vase was shattered by William Lloyd, who, after drinking all the previous week, threw a nearby sculpture on top of the case, smashing both it and the vase. He was arrested and charged with the crime of willful damage. When his lawyer said that an error in the wording of the act seemed to limit its application to the destruction of objects worth no more than £5, he was convicted instead of the destruction of the glass case in which the vase had sat. He was sentenced to either pay a fine of £3 (approximately £350 equivalent in 2017) or spend two months in prison. He remained in prison until an anonymous benefactor paid the fine by mail. The name William Lloyd is thought to be a pseudonym. Investigators hired by the British Museum concluded that he was actually William Mulcahy, a student who had gone missing from Trinity College Dublin. Detectives reported that the Mulcahy family was impoverished. The owner of the vase declined to bring a civil action against William Mulcahy because he did not want his family to suffer for &quot;an act of folly or madness which they could not control&quot;.

The vase was pieced together with fair success in 1845 by British Museum restorer John Doubleday. At the time, the restoration was termed &quot;masterly&quot; and Doubleday was lauded by &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; for demonstrating &quot;skilful ingenuity&quot; and &quot;cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers&quot;.

However, Doubleday was unable to replace thirty-seven small fragments of the vase, which had been put into a box and apparently forgotten. On 5 October 1948, the keeper Bernard Ashmole received them in a box from G. A. Croker of Putney, who did not know what they were. After Doubleday&#x27;s death, a fellow restorer from the British Museum took them to G. H. Gabb, a box maker, who was asked to make a box with thirty seven compartments, one for each fragment. However, the restorer also died and the box was never collected. After Gabb&#x27;s death, the executor of his estate, Amy Reeves, brought in Croker to assess Gabb&#x27;s effects. This was how Crocker came to bring them to the museum to ask for help in identifying them.

By November 1948, the restoration appeared aged and it was decided to restore the vase again. It was dismantled by conservator J. W. R. Axtell in mid-November 1948. The pieces were examined by D. B. Harden and W. A. Thorpe, who confirmed that the circular glass base removed in 1845 was not original. Axtell then carried out a reconstruction, completed by 2 February 1949, in which he was only successful in replacing three of the 37 loose fragments. He reportedly used &quot;new adhesives&quot; for this restoration, which some thought might be epoxy resins or shellac, but were later discovered to simply be the same type of animal glue that Doubleday used in 1845. He also filled some areas with wax. No documentation of his work was produced.

By the late 1980s, the adhesive was again yellowing and brittle. Although the vase was shown at the British Museum as part of the &quot;Glass of the Caesars&quot; exhibition (November 1987 – March 1988), it was too fragile to travel to other locations afterwards. Instead, another reconstruction was performed between 1 June 1988 and 1 October 1989 by Nigel Williams and Sandra Smith. The pair was overseen by David Akehurst (CCO of Glass and Ceramics) who had assessed the vase&#x27;s condition during the &quot;Glass of the Caesars&quot; exhibition and decided to go ahead with reconstruction and stabilization. The treatment had scholarly attention and press coverage. The vase was photographed and drawn to record the position of fragments before dismantling; the BBC filmed the conservation process. Conservation scientists at the museum tested many adhesives for long-term stability, choosing an epoxy resin with excellent ageing properties. Reassembly revealed some fragments had been filed down during the restorations, complicating the process. All but a few small splinters were integrated. Gaps were filled with blue or white resin.

Little sign of the original damage is visible, and, except for light cleaning, it is hoped that the vase should not require major conservation work for at least another century.

<doc id="24707" wikidata="Q12431" url="?curid=24707" title="Pyrenees">
<text>The Pyrenees are a mountain range straddling the border of France and Spain. They extend nearly from their union with the Cantabrian Mountains to Cap de Creus on the Mediterranean coast, reaching a maximum altitude of at the peak of Aneto.

For the most part, the main crest forms a divide between Spain and France, with the microstate of Andorra sandwiched in between. Historically, the Crown of Aragon and the Kingdom of Navarre extended on both sides of the mountain range.

== Etymology ==
In Greek mythology, Pyrene is a princess who gave her name to the Pyrenees. The Greek historian Herodotus says Pyrene is the name of a town in Celtic Europe. According to Silius Italicus, she was the virgin daughter of Bebryx, a king in Mediterranean Gaul by whom the hero Hercules was given hospitality during his quest to steal the cattle of Geryon during his famous Labours. Hercules, characteristically drunk and lustful, violates the sacred code of hospitality and rapes his host&#x27;s daughter. Pyrene gives birth to a serpent and runs away to the woods, afraid that her father will be angry. Alone, she pours out her story to the trees, attracting the attention of wild beasts who tear her to pieces.

After his victory over Geryon, Hercules passes through the kingdom of Bebryx again, finding the girl&#x27;s lacerated remains. As is often the case in stories of this hero, the sober Hercules responds with heartbroken grief and remorse at the actions of his darker self, and lays Pyrene to rest tenderly, demanding that the surrounding geography join in mourning and preserve her name: &quot;struck by Herculean voice, the mountaintops shudder at the ridges; he kept crying out with a sorrowful noise &#x27;Pyrene!&#x27; and all the rock-cliffs and wild-beast haunts echo back &#x27;Pyrene!&#x27; ... The mountains hold on to the wept-over name through the ages.&quot; Pliny the Elder connects the story of Hercules and Pyrene to Lusitania, but rejects it as &quot;fabulosa&quot;, highly fictional.

Other classical sources derived the name from the Greek word for fire, (IPA: ). According to Greek historian Diodorus Siculus &quot;in ancient times, we are told, certain herdsmen left a fire and the whole area of the mountains was entirely consumed; and due to this fire, since it raged continuously day after day, the surface of the earth was also burned and the mountains, because of what had taken place, were called the Pyrenees.&quot;

== Geography ==

=== Political divisions ===
The Spanish Pyrenees are part of the following provinces, from east to west: Girona, Barcelona, Lleida (all in Catalonia), Huesca (in Aragon), Navarra (in Navarre).

The French Pyrenees are part of the following &quot;départements&quot;, from east to west: Pyrénées-Orientales (also known as Northern Catalonia), Aude, Ariège, Haute-Garonne, Hautes-Pyrénées, and Pyrénées-Atlantiques (the latter two of which include the Pyrenees National Park).

The independent principality of Andorra is sandwiched in the eastern portion of the mountain range between the Spanish Pyrenees and French Pyrenees.




=== Physiographical divisions ===

Physiographically, the Pyrenees may be divided into three sections: the Atlantic (or Western), the Central, and the Eastern Pyrenees. Together, they form a distinct physiographic province of the larger Alpine System division.

In the Western Pyrenees, from the Basque mountains near the Bay of Biscay of the Atlantic Ocean, the average elevation gradually increases from west to east.

The Central Pyrenees extend eastward from the Somport pass to the Aran Valley, and they include the highest summits of this range:
* Pico de Aneto in the Maladeta ridge,
* Pico Posets ,
* Monte Perdido .

In the Eastern Pyrenees, with the exception of one break at the eastern extremity of the &quot;Pyrénées Ariégeoises&quot; in the Ariège area, the mean elevation is remarkably uniform until a sudden decline occurs in the easternmost portion of the chain known as the Albères.

==== Foothills ====

Most foothills of the Pyrenees are on the Spanish side, where there is a large and complex system of ranges stretching from Spanish Navarre, across northern Aragon and into Catalonia, almost reaching the Mediterranean coast with summits reaching . At the eastern end on the southern side lies a distinct area known as the Sub-Pyrenees.

On the French side the slopes of the main range descend abruptly and there are no foothills except in the Corbières Massif in the northeastern corner of the mountain system.

== Geology ==
The Pyrenees are older than the Alps: their sediments were first deposited in coastal basins during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras. During Ediacaran to Ordovician times, Pyrenees were located at the Northwest margin of Gondwana, where they formed a lateral continuity of neighbouring areas, such as the Montagne Noire and the Mouthoumet massifs and Southwestern territory of Sardinia. Between 100 and 150 million years ago, during the Early Cretaceous Period, the Bay of Biscay fanned out, pushing present-day Spain against France and applying intense compressional pressure to large layers of sedimentary rock. The intense pressure and uplifting of the Earth&#x27;s crust first affected the eastern part and moved progressively to the entire chain, culminating in the Eocene Epoch.

The eastern part of the Pyrenees consists largely of granite and gneissose rocks, while in the western part the granite peaks are flanked by layers of limestone. The massive and unworn character of the chain comes from its abundance of granite, which is particularly resistant to erosion, as well as weak glacial development.

The upper parts of the Pyrenees contain low-relief surfaces forming a peneplain. This peneplain originated no earlier than in Late Miocene times. Presumably it formed at height as extensive sedimentation raised the local base level considerably.

== Landscape ==
Conspicuous features of Pyrenean scenery are:
* the absence of great lakes, such as those that fill the lateral valleys of the Alps
* the rarity and relative high elevation of usable passes
* the large number of the mountain torrents locally called &quot;gaves&quot;, which often form lofty waterfalls, surpassed in Europe only by those of Scandinavia
* the frequency with which the upper end of a valley assumes the form of a semicircle of precipitous cliffs, called a cirque.

The highest waterfall is Gavarnie (462 m or 1,515 ft), at the head of the Gave de Pau; the Cirque de Gavarnie, in the same valley, together with the nearby Cirque de Troumouse and Cirque d&#x27;Estaubé, are notable examples of the cirque formation.

Low passes are lacking, and the principal roads and the railroads between France and Spain run only in the lowlands at the western and eastern ends of the Pyrenees, near sea level. The main passes of note are:
* Col de la Perche (), towards the east, between the valley of the Têt and the valley of the Segre,
* Col de Puymorens (), on European route E09 between France and Spain.
* The nearby Pas de la Casa or Port d&#x27;Envalira, the highest road pass in the Pyrenees at , and one of the highest points of the European road network, which provides the route from France to Andorra,
* The Port de la Bonaigua (), in the middle of the range at the head of the Aran Valley.
* Plan de Beret ()
* Col du Pourtalet ().
* The Col de Somport or Port de Canfranc (), where there were old Roman roads.
* Col de la Pierre St Martin ()
* Puerto de Larrau ()
* The Roncevaux Pass (), entirely in Navarre (Spain) is an important point on the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route.
Because of the lack of low passes a number of tunnels have been created, beneath the passes at Somport, Envalira, and Puymorens and new routes in the center of the range at Bielsa and Vielha.

A notable visual feature of this mountain range is La Brèche de Roland, a gap in the ridge line, whichaccording to legendwas created by Roland.


== Natural resources ==
The metallic ores of the Pyrenees are not in general of much importance now, though there were iron mines at several locations in Andorra, as well as at Vicdessos in Ariège, and the foot of Canigó in Pyrénées-Orientales long ago. Coal deposits capable of being profitably worked are situated chiefly on the Spanish slopes, but the French side has beds of lignite. The open pit of Trimoun near the commune of Luzenac (Ariège) is one of the greatest sources of talc in Europe.
There are many marble quarries in the Pyrenees, most of which were opened by the Romans in ancient times. Quarried intermittently, they provided prestigious marbles such as Grand Antique (used in Rome and Constantinople by the Romans), statuary white marbles as well as coloured marbles used to decorate the royal palaces of the Louvre and Versailles in France and the Royal Palace of Madrid in Spain.

Mineral springs are abundant and remarkable, and especially noteworthy are the hot springs. The hot springs, among which those of Les Escaldes in Andorra, Panticosa and Lles in Spain, Ax-les-Thermes, Bagnères-de-Luchon and Eaux-Chaudes in France may be mentioned, are sulfurous and mostly situated high, near the contact of the granite with the stratified rocks. The lower springs, such as those of Bagnères-de-Bigorre (Hautes-Pyrénées), Rennes-les-Bains (Aude), and Campagne-sur-Aude (Aude), are mostly selenitic and not hot.

== Climate ==
The amount of precipitation the range receives, including rain and snow, is much greater in the western than in the eastern Pyrenees because of the moist air that blows in from the Atlantic Ocean over the Bay of Biscay. After dropping its moisture over the western and central Pyrenees, the air is left dry over the eastern Pyrenees. The winter average temperature is .

Sections of the mountain range vary in more than one respect. There are some glaciers in the western and snowy central Pyrenees, but there are no glaciers in the eastern Pyrenees because there is insufficient snowfall to cause their development. Glaciers are confined to the northern slopes of the central Pyrenees, and do not descend, like those of the Alps, far down into the valleys but rather have their greatest lengths along the direction of the mountain chain. They form, in fact, in a narrow zone near the crest of the highest mountains. Here, as in the other great mountain ranges of central Europe, there is substantial evidence of a much wider expanse of glaciation during the glacial periods. The best evidence of this is in the valley of Argeles Gazost, between Lourdes and Gavarnie, in the &quot;&quot; of Hautes-Pyrénées.

The annual snow-line varies in different parts of the Pyrenees from about above sea level. In average the seasonal snow is observed at least 50% of the time above between December and April.

== Flora and fauna ==

=== Flora ===


A still more marked effect of the preponderance of rainfall in the western half of the chain is seen in the vegetation. The lower mountains in the extreme west are wooded, but the extent of forest declines as one moves eastwards. The eastern Pyrenees are peculiarly wild and barren, all the more since it is in this part of the chain that granitic masses prevail. Also moving from west to east, there is a change in the composition of the flora, with the change becoming most evident as one passes the centre of the mountain chain from which point the Corbières Massif stretch north-eastwards towards the central plateau of France. Though the difference in latitude is only about 1°, in the west the flora resembles that of central Europe while in the east it is distinctly Mediterranean in character. The Pyrenees are nearly as rich in endemic species as the Alps, and among the most remarkable instances of that endemism is the occurrence of the monotypic genus &quot;Xatardia&quot; (family Apiaceae), which grows only on a high alpine pass between the Val d&#x27;Eynes and Catalonia. Other examples include &quot;Arenaria montana&quot;, &quot;Bulbocodium vernum&quot;, and &quot;Ranunculus glacialis&quot;. The genus most abundantly represented in the range is that of the saxifrages, several species of which are endemic here.

=== Fauna ===
In their fauna the Pyrenees present some striking instances of endemism. The Pyrenean desman is found only in some of the streams of the northern slopes of these mountains; the only other desman, the Russian desman, is confined to the Volga river basin in southern Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. The Pyrenean brook salamander (&quot;Calotriton asper&quot;), an endemic amphibian, also lives in streams and lakes located at high altitudes. Among other peculiarities of Pyrenean fauna are blind insects in the caverns of Ariège, the principal genera of which are &quot;Anophthalmus&quot; and &quot;Adelops&quot;.

The Pyrenean ibex, an endemic subspecies of the Iberian ibex, became extinct in January 2000; another subspecies, the western Spanish ibex, was introduced into the area, with the population numbering over 400 individuals as of 2020. The native brown bear population was hunted to near-extinction in the 1990s, but its numbers rebounded in 1996 when three bears were brought from Slovenia. The bear population has bred successfully, and there are now believed to be about 15 brown bears in the central region around Fos, with only four native ones still living in the Aspe Valley.

== Protected areas ==

Principal nature reserves and national parks:
* Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park (Spain)
* Pyrénées National Park (France)
* Aigüestortes i Estany de Sant Maurici National Park (Spain)
* Posets-Maladeta Natural Park (Spain)

In 1997, part of the Pyrenees (including Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park and Pyrenees National Park) was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List for its spectacular geologic landforms and testimony to the unique &quot;transhumance&quot; agricultural system.

== Demographics and culture ==

The Pyrenean region possesses a varied ethnology, folklore and history: see Andorra; Aragon; Ariège; Basque Country; Béarn; Catalonia; Navarre; Roussillon. For their history, see also Almogavars, Marca Hispanica.

The principal languages spoken in the area are Spanish, French, Aragonese, Catalan (in Andorra and in Northern and Southern Catalonia), and Basque. Also spoken, to a lesser degree, is the Occitan language, consisting of the Gascon and Languedocien dialects in France and the Aranese dialect in the Aran Valley.

An important feature of rural life in the Pyrenees is &#x27;transhumance&#x27;, the moving of livestock from the farms in the valleys up to the higher grounds of the mountains for the summer. In this way the farming communities could keep larger herds than the lowland farms could support on their own. The principal animals moved were cows and sheep, but historically most members of farming families also moved to the higher pastures along with their animals, so they also took with them pigs, horses and chickens. Transhumance thus took the form of a mass biannual migration, moving uphill in May or June and returning to the farms in September or October. During the summer period, the families would live in basic stone cabins in the high mountains.

Nowadays, industrialisation and changing agriculture practices have diminished the custom. However, the importance of transhumance continues to be recognised through its celebration in popular festivals.

==Scientific facilities==
===Pic du Midi Observatory===

The Pic du Midi Observatory is an astronomical observatory located at 2877 metres on top of the Pic du Midi de Bigorre in the French Pyrenees. Construction of the observatory began in 1878 and the 8-metre dome was completed in 1908.

The observatory housed a powerful mechanical equatorial reflector which was used in 1909 to formally discredit the Martian canal theory. A telescope was installed in 1963, funded by NASA and was used to take detailed photographs of the surface of the Moon in preparation for the Apollo missions. Other studies conducted in 1965 provided a detailed analysis of the composition of the atmospheres on Mars and Venus, this served as a basis for Jet Propulsion Laboratory scientists to predict that these planets had no life.

Since 1980, the observatory has had a 2-metre telescope, which is the largest telescope in France. Overtaken by the giant telescopes built in recent decades, today the observatory is widely open to amateur astronomy.

===Odeillo solar furnace===

The Odeillo solar furnace is the world&#x27;s largest solar furnace. It is situated in Font-Romeu-Odeillo-Via, in the department of Pyrénées-Orientales, in south of France. Built between 1962 and 1968, it is and wide, and includes 63 heliostats. The site was chosen because of the length and the quality of sunshine with direct light (more than 2,500 h/year) and the purity of its atmosphere (high altitude and low average humidity).

This furnace serves as a science research site studying materials at very high temperatures. Temperatures above can be obtained in a few seconds; in addition, it provides rapid temperature changes and therefore allows studying the effect of thermal shocks.

==Urban areas==

No big cities are in the range itself. The largest urban area close to the Pyrenees is Toulouse (Haute-Garonne), France with a population of 1,330,954 in its metropolitan area. On the Spanish side Pamplona (Navarre) is the closest city, with a population of 319,208 in its metropolitan area. Inside the Pyrenees the main towns are Andorra la Vella (22,256) and Escaldes-Engordany (14,367) in Andorra, Jaca (12,813) and La Seu d&#x27;Urgell (12,252) in Spain, and Lourdes (13,976) and Foix (10,046) in France.

== Sports and leisure ==

Both sides of the Pyrenees are popular spots for winter sports such as alpine skiing and mountaineering. The Pyrenees are also a good place for athletes to do high-altitude training in the summertime, such as by bicycling and cross-country running.

In the summer and the autumn, the Pyrenees are usually featured in two of cycling&#x27;s grand tours, the Tour de France held annually in July and the Vuelta a España held in September. The stages held in the Pyrenees are often crucial legs of both tours, drawing hundreds of thousands of spectators to the region.

Three main long-distance footpaths run the length of the mountain range: the GR 10 across the northern slopes, the GR 11 across the southern slopes, and the HRP which traverses peaks and ridges along a high altitude route. In addition, there are numerous marked and unmarked trails throughout the region.

&quot;Pirena&quot; is a dog-mushing competition held in the Pyrenees.

<doc id="24709" wikidata="Q1463003" url="?curid=24709" title="Planetary nomenclature">
<text>Planetary [[nomenclature]], like terrestrial nomenclature, is a system of uniquely identifying features on the surface of a planet or natural satellite so that the features can be easily located, described, and discussed. Since the invention of the telescope, astronomers have given names to the surface features they have discerned, especially on the Moon and Mars. To found an authority on planetary nomenclature, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) was organized in 1919 to designate and standardize names for features on Solar System bodies.

== IAU approval procedure ==

When images are first obtained of the surface of a planet or satellite, a theme for naming features is chosen and a few important features are named, usually by members of the appropriate IAU task group (a commonly accepted planet-naming group). Later, as higher resolution images and maps become available, additional features are named at the request of investigators mapping or describing specific surfaces, features, or geologic formations. Anyone may suggest that a specific name be considered by a task group. If the members of the task group agree that the name is appropriate, it can be retained for use when there is a request from a member of the scientific community for a name of a specific feature. Names that pass review by a task group are submitted to the IAU Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN). Once approved by the WGPSN, names are considered official and can be used on maps and in publications. They are also listed in the Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature.

== IAU rules and conventions ==

Names adopted by the IAU must follow various rules and conventions established and amended through the years by the Union. These include:

#Nomenclature is a tool and the first consideration should be to make it simple, clear, and unambiguous.
#In general, official names will not be given to features whose longest dimensions are less than 100 meters, although exceptions may be made for smaller features having exceptional scientific interest.
#The number of names chosen for each body should be kept to a minimum. Features should be named only when they have special scientific interest, and when the naming of such features is useful to the scientific and cartographic communities at large.
#Duplication of the same surface feature name on two or more bodies, and of the same name for satellites and minor planets, is discouraged. Duplications may be allowed when names are especially appropriate and the chances for confusion are very small.
#Individual names chosen for each body should be expressed in the language of origin. Transliteration for various alphabets should be given, but there will be no translation from one language to another.
#Where possible, the themes established in early solar system nomenclature should be used and expanded on.
#Solar system nomenclature should be international in its choice of names. Recommendations submitted to the IAU national committees will be considered, but final selection of the names is the responsibility of the International Astronomical Union. Where appropriate, the WGPSN strongly supports an equitable selection of names from ethnic groups, countries, and gender on each map; however, a higher percentage of names from the country planning a landing is allowed on landing site maps.
#No names having political, military or (modern) religious significance may be used, except for names of political figures prior to the 19th century.
#Commemoration of persons on planetary bodies should not normally be a goal in itself, but may be employed in special circumstances and is reserved for persons of high and enduring international standing. Persons being so honored must have been deceased for at least three years.
#When more than one spelling of a name is extant, the spelling preferred by the person, or used in an authoritative reference, should be used. Diacritical marks are a necessary part of a name and will be used.
#Ring and ring-gap nomenclature and names for newly discovered satellites are developed in joint deliberation between WGPSN and IAU Commission 20. Names will not be assigned to satellites until their orbital elements are reasonably well known or definite features have been identified on them.
#Accessible and authoritative sources, including Internet sources, are required for adopted names. Wikipedia is not sufficient as a source, but may be useful for identifying appropriate sources.

In addition to these general rules, each task group develops additional conventions as it formulates an interesting and meaningful nomenclature for individual planetary bodies.

== Naming conventions ==

Names for all planetary features include a descriptor term, with the exception of two feature types. For craters, the descriptor term is implicit. Some features named on Io and Triton do not carry a descriptor term because they are ephemeral.

In general, the naming convention for a feature type remains the same regardless of its size. Exceptions to this rule are valleys and craters on Mars and Venus; naming conventions for these features differ according to size.

One feature classification, &quot;regio&quot;, was originally used on early maps of the Moon and Mercury (drawn from telescopic observations) to describe vague albedo features. It is now used to delineate a broad geographic region.

Named features on bodies so small that coordinates have not yet been determined are identified on drawings of the body that are included in the IAU Transactions volume of the year when the names were adopted. Satellite rings and gaps in the rings are named for scientists who have studied these features; drawings that show these names are also included in the pertinent Transactions volume. Names for atmospheric features are informal at present; a formal system will be chosen in the future.

The boundaries of many large features (such as &quot;terrae, regiones, planitiae&quot; and &quot;plana&quot;) are not topographically or geomorphically distinct; the coordinates of these features are identified from an arbitrarily chosen center point. Boundaries (and thus coordinates) may be determined more accurately from geochemical and geophysical data obtained by future missions.

During active missions, small surface features are often given informal names. These may include landing sites, spacecraft impact sites, and small topographic features, such as craters, hills, and rocks. Such names will not be given official status by the IAU, except as provided for by Rule 2 above. As for the larger objects, official names for any such small features would have to conform to established IAU rules and categories.

== Descriptor terms (feature types) ==
== Categories for naming features on planets and satellites ==

=== Mercury ===


=== Venus ===

All but three features on Venus are named after female personages (goddesses and historical or mythological women). These three exceptions were named before the convention was adopted, being respectively Alpha Regio, Beta Regio, and Maxwell Montes which is named after James Clerk Maxwell.

=== The Moon ===

=== Mars and martian satellites ===

==== Mars ====


When space probes have landed on Mars, individual small features such as rocks, dunes, and hollows have often been given informal names. Many of these are frivolous: features have been named after ice cream (such as Cookies N Cream); cartoon characters (such as SpongeBob SquarePants and Patrick); and 1970s music acts (such as ABBA and the Bee Gees).

==== Deimos ====
Features on Deimos are named after authors who wrote about Martian satellites. There are currently two named features on Deimos Swift crater and Voltaire crater after Jonathan Swift and Voltaire who predicted the presence of Martian moons.

==== Phobos ====

All features on Phobos are named after scientists involved with the discovery, dynamics, or properties of the Martian satellites or people and places from Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;.

=== Satellites of Jupiter ===

==== Amalthea====

People and places associated with the Amalthea myth.

====Thebe====

Features on Thebe are named after people and places associated with the Thebe myth. There is only one named feature on Thebe Zethus Crater.

====Io====

====Europa====

====Ganymede====

====Callisto====

====Small satellites====
There are currently no named features on Uranian small satellites, however the naming convention is heroines from plays by Shakespeare and Pope.

=== Satellites of Neptune ===

====Proteus====

Features on Proteus are to be named after water-related spirits, gods or goddesses who are neither Greek nor Roman. The only named feature on Proteus is crater Pharos.

====Triton====

Geological features on Triton should be assigned aquatic names, excluding those which are Roman and Greek in origin. Possible themes for individual descriptor terms include worldwide aquatic spirits, famous terrestrial fountains or fountain locations, terrestrial aquatic features, famous terrestrial geysers or geyser locations and terrestrial islands.

====Nereid====

There are currently no named features on Nereid. When features are discovered, they are to be named after individual nereids.

====Small satellites====

Features on other satellites of Neptune, once discovered, should be named after gods and goddesses associated with Neptune/Poseidon mythology or generic mythological aquatic beings.

=== Pluto and satellites ===
In February 2017, the IAU approved the following themes for surface features on Pluto and its satellites:
==== Pluto ====

* Gods, goddesses, and other beings associated with the Underworld from mythology, folklore and literature.
* Names for the Underworld and for Underworld locales from mythology, folklore and literature.
* Heroes and other explorers of the Underworld.
* Scientists and engineers associated with Pluto and the Kuiper Belt.
* Pioneering space missions and spacecraft.

<text>The North American Aviation P-51 Mustang is an American long-range, single-seat fighter and fighter-bomber used during World War II and the Korean War, among other conflicts. The Mustang was designed in 1940 by a team headed by James H. Kindelberger of North American Aviation (NAA) in response to a requirement of the British Purchasing Commission. The commission approached NAA to build Curtiss P-40 fighters under license for the Royal Air Force (RAF). Rather than build an old design from another company, NAA proposed the design and production of a more modern fighter. The prototype NA-73X airframe was completed on 9 September 1940, 102 days after contract signing, achieving its first flight on 26 October.

The Mustang was designed to use the Allison V-1710 engine without an export-sensitive turbosupercharger or a multi-stage supercharger, resulting in limited high-altitude performance. The aircraft was first flown operationally and very successfully by the RAF and as a tactical-reconnaissance aircraft and fighter-bomber (Mustang Mk I). In mid 1942, a development project known as the Rolls-Royce Mustang X, replaced the Allison engine with a Rolls-Royce Merlin 65 two-stage inter-cooled supercharged engine. During testing at Rolls-Royce&#x27;s airfield at Hucknall in England, it was clear the engine dramatically improved the aircraft&#x27;s performance at altitudes above without sacrificing range. Following receipt of the test results and after further flights by a number of USAAF pilots, the results were so positive that North American began work on converting several aircraft developing into the P-51B/C (Mustang Mk III) model, which became the first long range fighter to be able to compete with the Luftwaffe&#x27;s fighters. The definitive version, the P-51D, was powered by the Packard V-1650-7, a license-built version of the two-speed, two-stage-supercharged Merlin 66, and was armed with six .50 caliber (12.7 mm) AN/M2 Browning machine guns.

From late 1943, P-51Bs and P-51Cs (supplemented by P-51Ds from mid-1944) were used by the USAAF&#x27;s Eighth Air Force to escort bombers in raids over Germany, while the RAF&#x27;s Second Tactical Air Force and the USAAF&#x27;s Ninth Air Force used the Merlin-powered Mustangs as fighter-bombers, roles in which the Mustang helped ensure Allied air superiority in 1944. The P-51 was also used by Allied air forces in the North African, Mediterranean, Italian, and Pacific theaters. During World War II, Mustang pilots claimed to have destroyed 4,950 enemy aircraft.

At the start of the Korean War, the Mustang, by then redesignated F-51, was the main fighter of the United States until jet fighters, including North American&#x27;s F-86 Sabre, took over this role; the Mustang then became a specialized fighter-bomber. Despite the advent of jet fighters, the Mustang remained in service with some air forces until the early 1980s. After the Korean War, Mustangs became popular civilian warbirds and air racing aircraft.

==Design and development==


In 1938, the British government established a purchasing commission in the United States, headed by Sir Henry Self. Self was given overall responsibility for RAF production, research, and development, and also served with Sir Wilfrid Freeman, the Air Member for Development and Production. Self also sat on the British Air Council Subcommittee on Supply (or &quot;Supply Committee&quot;), and one of his tasks was to organize the manufacturing and supply of American fighter aircraft for the RAF. At the time, the choice was very limited, as no U.S. aircraft then in production or flying met European standards, with only the Curtiss P-40 Tomahawk coming close. The Curtiss-Wright plant was running at capacity, so P-40s were in short supply.

North American Aviation (NAA) was already supplying its T-6 Texan (known in British service as the &quot;Harvard&quot;) trainer to the RAF, but was otherwise underused. NAA President &quot;Dutch&quot; Kindelberger approached Self to sell a new medium bomber, the North American B-25 Mitchell. Instead, Self asked if NAA could manufacture P-40s under license from Curtiss. Kindelberger said NAA could have a better aircraft with the same Allison V-1710 engine in the air sooner than establishing a production line for the P-40.

John Attwood of NAA spent much time from January to April 1940 at the British Purchasing Commission&#x27;s offices in New York discussing the British specifications of the proposed aircraft with British engineers. The discussions consisted of free-hand conceptual drawings of an aircraft with the British officials. Self was concerned that NAA had not ever designed a fighter, insisting they obtain the drawings and study the wind-tunnel test results for the P-40, before presenting them with detailed design drawings based on the agreed concept. NAA purchased the drawings and data from Curtiss for £56,000, confirming the purchase with the British Purchasing Commission. The commission approved the resulting detailed design drawings, signing the commencement of the Mustang project on 4 May 1940, and firmly ordering 320 on 29 May 1940. Prior to this, NAA only had a letter of intent for an order of 320 aircraft. Curtiss engineers accused NAA of plagiarism.

The British Purchasing Commission stipulated armament of four .303 in (7.7 mm) machine guns (as used on the Tomahawk), a unit cost of no more than $40,000, and delivery of the first production aircraft by January 1941. In March 1940, 320 aircraft were ordered by Freeman, who had become the executive head of the Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP) and the contract was promulgated on 24 April.

The &quot;NA-73X&quot;, which was designed by a team led by lead engineer Edgar Schmued, followed the best conventional practice of the era, designed for ease of mass manufacturing. The design included several new features. One was a wing designed using laminar flow airfoils, which were developed co-operatively by NAA and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA). These airfoils generated low drag at high speeds. During the development of the NA-73X, a wind-tunnel test of two wings, one using NACA five-digit airfoils and the other using the new NAA/NACA 45–100 airfoils, was performed in the University of Washington Kirsten Wind Tunnel. The results of this test showed the superiority of the wing designed with the NAA/NACA 45–100 airfoils.
The other feature was a new cooling arrangement positioned aft (single ducted water and oil radiators assembly) that reduced the fuselage drag and effects on the wing. Later, after much development, they discovered that the cooling assembly could take advantage of the Meredith effect, in which heated air exited the radiator with a slight amount of jet thrust. Because NAA lacked a suitable wind tunnel to test this feature, it used the GALCIT wind tunnel at the California Institute of Technology. This led to some controversy over whether the Mustang&#x27;s cooling system aerodynamics were developed by NAA&#x27;s engineer Schmued or by Curtiss, as NAA had purchased the complete set of P-40 wind tunnel data and flight test reports. The NA-73X was also one of the first aircraft to have a fuselage lofted mathematically using conic sections; this resulted in smooth, low-drag surfaces. To aid production, the airframe was divided into five main sections—forward, center, rear fuselage, and two wing halves—all of which were fitted with wiring and piping before being joined.

The prototype NA-73X was rolled out in September 1940, just 102 days after the order had been placed; it first flew on 26 October 1940, 149 days into the contract, an uncommonly short development period even during the war. With test pilot Vance Breese at the controls, the prototype handled well and accommodated an impressive fuel load. The aircraft&#x27;s three-section, semi-monocoque fuselage was constructed entirely of 24S aluminum alloy (a type of Duralumin) to save weight. It was armed with four .30 caliber (7.62 mm) AN/M2 Browning machine guns in the wings and two .50 caliber (12.7 mm) AN/M2 Browning machine guns mounted under the engine and firing through the propeller arc using a gun-synchronizing gear.

While the USAAC could block any sales it considered detrimental to the interests of the US, the NA-73 was considered to be a special case because it had been designed at the behest of the British and all dealings were directly between the BPC and NAA, and did not involve the US Army or Wright Field in any way. In September 1940, a further 300 NA-73s were ordered by the MAP. To ensure uninterrupted delivery, Colonel Oliver P. Echols arranged with the Anglo-French Purchasing Commission to deliver the aircraft and NAA gave two examples (41-038 and 41-039) to the USAAC for evaluation.

It is important to note that the Mustang I (NA-73 and NA-83) and the Ia (NA-91), produced for the British, were not equivalent to the P-51A which was a later model (NA-99). Two British Mustang Is were held back by the USAAF and given the provisional model number XP-51. The USAAF held back 57 Mustang Ia aircraft armed with 4 x 20mm Hispano cannon, from the third British order, converting most of them to tactical reconnaissance aircraft and designating them P-51-2/F6A. North American retained the second aircraft of this batch to help develop the P-51A.

The Allison engine in the Mustang I had a single-stage supercharger that caused power to drop off rapidly above . This made it unsuitable for use at the altitudes where combat was taking place in Europe. Allison&#x27;s attempts at developing a high-altitude engine were underfunded, but produced the V-1710-45, which featured a variable-speed auxiliary supercharger and developed at . In November 1941, NAA studied the possibility of using it, but fitting its excessive length in the Mustang would require extensive airframe modifications and cause long production delays. In May 1942, following positive reports from the RAF on the Mustang I&#x27;s performance below 15,000 ft, Ronald Harker, a test pilot for Rolls-Royce, suggested fitting a Merlin 61, as fitted to the Spitfire Mk IX. The Merlin 61 had a two-speed, two-stage, intercooled supercharger, designed by Stanley Hooker of Rolls-Royce. Both the Merlin 61 and V-1710-39 were capable of about war emergency power at relatively low altitudes, but the Merlin developed at versus the Allison&#x27;s at , delivering an increase in top speed from at ~ to an estimated at . In the end the Merlin 61 was never fitted to the Mustang X, (or any other Mustang). The 65 series (a medium altitude engine) was fitted to all Mustang X prototypes.

Initially, the Mustang&#x27;s steadfast champion, USAAC/F Assistant Air Attaché Major Thomas Hitchcock, was concerned that the USAAF had little or no interest in the potential of the P-51A and its development with the Merlin engine. He wrote: &quot;Its development in this theatre has suffered for various reasons. Sired by the English out of an American mother, the Mustang has no parent in the Army Air Corps to appreciate and push its good points. It does not fully satisfy good people on both sides of the Atlantic who seem more interested in pointing with pride to the development of a 100% national product...&quot;

Nevertheless, during the British service development program of the Mustang I at Rolls-Royce&#x27;s airfield at Hucknall, a close relationship was developed between NAA, the RAF Air Fighting Development Unit and Rolls Royce Rolls-Royce Flight Test Establishment at Hucknall.

Following extensive communication between Hitchcock (based in England), Rolls Royce engineers and Phillip Legarra at NAA regarding the promising outlook of a Merlin Mustang, along with the subsequent work in progress by Rolls Royce on the Mustang X, NAA representatives including Mustang designer Schmued visited the UK to examine and discuss the project in detail.

The promising calculations and modification progress by Rolls Royce led in July 1942 to a contract being let for two NAA Merlin prototypes, briefly designated XP-78, but soon to become the XP-51B. Based on the Packard V-1650-3 duplicating the Merlin 61&#x27;s performance, NAA estimated for the XP-78 a top speed of at , and a service ceiling of .

Initial flights of what was known to Rolls-Royce as the Mustang X were completed at Hucknall in October 1942.

The first flight of the US version, designated XP-51B took place in November 1942, but the USAAF had become so interested in the Merlin Mustang project that an initial contract for 400 aircraft was placed three months beforehand in August. The conversion led to production of the P-51B beginning at NAA&#x27;s Inglewood, California, plant in June 1943, and P-51s started to become available to the 8th and 9th air forces in the winter of 1943–1944. Conversion to the two-stage supercharged and intercooled Merlin 60 series, over heavier than the single-stage Allison, driving a four-bladed Hamilton Standard propeller, required moving the wing slightly forward to correct the aircraft&#x27;s center of gravity. After the USAAF, in July 1943, directed fighter aircraft manufacturers to maximize internal fuel capacity, NAA calculated the P-51B&#x27;s center of gravity to be forward enough to include an additional fuel tank in the fuselage behind the pilot, greatly increasing the aircraft&#x27;s range over that of the earlier P-51A. NAA incorporated the tank in the production of the P-51B-10, and supplied kits to retrofit it to all existing P-51Bs.

==Operational history==
===United Kingdom operational service===

The Mustang was initially developed for the RAF, which was its first user. As the first Mustangs were built to British requirements, these aircraft used factory numbers and were not P-51s; the order comprised 320 NA-73s, followed by 300 NA-83s, all of which were designated Mustang Mark I by the RAF. The first RAF Mustangs supplied under Lend-Lease were 93 Mk Ia designated as P-51s by the USAAF, followed by 50 P-51As used as Mustang Mk IIs. Aircraft supplied to Britain under Lend-Lease were required for accounting purposes to be on the USAAC&#x27;s books before they could be supplied to Britain, but the British Aircraft Purchasing Commission signed its first contract for the North American NA-73 on 24 April 1940, before Lend-Lease was in effect. Thus, the initial order for the P-51 Mustang (as it was later known) was placed by the British under the &quot;cash and carry&quot; program, as required by the US Neutrality Acts of the 1930s.

After the arrival of the initial aircraft in the UK in October 1941, the first squadron of Mustang Mk Is entered service in January 1942, the first being No. 26 Squadron RAF. Due to poor high-altitude performance, the Mustangs were used by Army Co-operation Command, rather than Fighter Command, and were used for tactical reconnaissance and ground-attack duties. On 10 May 1942, Mustangs first flew over France, near Berck-sur-Mer. On 27 July 1942, 16 RAF Mustangs undertook their first long-range reconnaissance mission over Germany. During the amphibious Dieppe Raid on the French coast (19 August 1942), four British and Canadian Mustang squadrons, including 26 Squadron, saw action covering the assault on the ground. By 1943–1944, British Mustangs were used extensively to seek out V-1 flying bomb sites. The last RAF Mustang Mk I and Mustang Mk II aircraft were struck off charge in 1945.

Army Co-operation Command used the Mustang&#x27;s superior speed and long range to conduct low-altitude &quot;Rhubarb&quot; raids over continental Europe, sometimes penetrating German airspace. The V-1710 engine ran smoothly at 1,100 rpm, versus 1,600 for the Merlin, enabling long flights over water at altitude before approaching the enemy coastline. Over land, these flights followed a zig-zag course, turning every six minutes to foil enemy attempts at plotting an interception. During the first 18 months of Rhubarb raids, RAF Mustang Mk.Is and Mk.Ias destroyed or heavily damaged 200 locomotives, over 200 canal barges, and an unknown number of enemy aircraft parked on the ground, for a loss of eight Mustangs. At sea level, the Mustangs were able to outrun all enemy aircraft encountered. The RAF gained a significant performance enhancement at low altitude by removing or resetting the engine&#x27;s manifold pressure regulator to allow overboosting, raising output as high as 1,780 horsepower at 70 in Hg. In December 1942, Allison approved only 1,570 horsepower at 60 in Hg manifold pressure for the V-1710-39.

The RAF later operated 308 P-51Bs and 636 P-51Cs, which were known in RAF service as Mustang Mk IIIs; the first units converted to the type in late 1943 and early 1944. Mustang Mk III units were operational until the end of World War II, though many units had already converted to the Mustang Mk IV (P-51D) and Mk IVa (P-51K) (828 in total, comprising 282 Mk IV and 600 Mk IVa). As all except the earliest aircraft were obtained under Lend-Lease, all Mustang aircraft still on RAF charge at the end of the war were either returned to the USAAF &quot;on paper&quot; or retained by the RAF for scrapping. The last RAF Mustangs were retired from service in 1947.

===U.S. operational service===
====Prewar theory====
Prewar doctrine was based on the idea &quot;the bomber will always get through&quot;. Despite RAF and Luftwaffe experience with daylight bombing, the USAAF still incorrectly believed in 1942 that tightly packed formations of bombers would have so much firepower that they could fend off fighters on their own. Fighter escort was a low priority, but when the concept was discussed in 1941, the Lockheed P-38 Lightning was considered to be most appropriate, as it had the speed and range. Another school of thought favored a heavily up-armed &quot;gunship&quot; conversion of a strategic bomber. A single-engined, high-speed fighter with the range of a bomber was thought to be an engineering impossibility.

====Eighth Air Force bomber operations 1942–1943====

The 8th Air Force started operations from Britain in August 1942. At first, because of the limited scale of operations, no conclusive evidence showed American doctrine was failing. In the 26 operations flown to the end of 1942, the loss rate had been under 2%.

In January 1943, at the Casablanca Conference, the Allies formulated the Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO) plan for &quot;round-the-clock&quot; bombing – USAAF daytime operations complementing the RAF nighttime raids on industrial centers. In June 1943, the Combined Chiefs of Staff issued the Pointblank Directive to destroy the Luftwaffe&#x27;s capacity before the planned invasion of Europe, putting the CBO into full implementation. German daytime fighter efforts were, at that time, focused on the Eastern Front and several other distant locations. Initial efforts by the 8th met limited and unorganized resistance, but with every mission, the Luftwaffe moved more aircraft to the west and quickly improved their battle direction. In fall 1943, the 8th Air Force&#x27;s heavy bombers conducted a series of deep-penetration raids into Germany, beyond the range of escort fighters. The Schweinfurt–Regensburg mission in August lost 60 B-17s of a force of 376, the 14 October attack lost 77 of a force of 291—26% of the attacking force.

For the US, the very concept of self-defending bombers was called into question, but instead of abandoning daylight raids and turning to night bombing, as the RAF suggested, they chose other paths; at first, bombers converted to gunships (the Boeing YB-40) were believed to be able to escort the bomber formations, but when the concept proved to be unsuccessful, thoughts then turned to the Lockheed P-38 Lightning. In early 1943, the USAAF also decided that the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt and P-51B be considered for the roles of smaller escort fighters, and in July, a report stated that the P-51B was &quot;the most promising plane&quot; with an endurance of 4 hours 45 minutes with the standard internal fuel of 184 gallons plus 150 gallons carried externally. In August, a P-51B was fitted with an extra internal 85-gallon tank, but problems with longitudinal stability occurred, so some compromises in performance with the full tank were made. Since the fuel from the fuselage tank was used during the initial stages of a mission, the fuel tank would be fitted in all Mustangs destined for VIII Fighter Command.

====P-51 introduction====
The P-51 Mustang was a solution to the need for an effective bomber escort. It used a common, reliable engine and had internal space for a larger-than-average fuel load. With external fuel tanks, it could accompany the bombers from England to Germany and back.

By the time the Pointblank offensive resumed in early 1944, matters had changed. Bomber escort defenses were initially layered, using the shorter-range P-38s and P-47s to escort the bombers during the initial stages of the raid before handing over to the P-51s when they were forced to turn for home. This provided continuous coverage during the raid. The Mustang was so clearly superior to earlier US designs that the 8th Air Force began to steadily switch its fighter groups to the Mustang, first swapping arriving P-47 groups to the 9th Air Force in exchange for those that were using P-51s, then gradually converting its Thunderbolt and Lightning groups. By the end of 1944, 14 of its 15 groups flew Mustangs.

The Luftwaffe&#x27;s twin-engined Messerschmitt Bf 110 heavy fighters brought up to deal with the bombers proved to be easy prey for the Mustangs, and had to be quickly withdrawn from combat. The Focke-Wulf Fw 190A, already suffering from poor high-altitude performance, was outperformed by the Mustang at the B-17&#x27;s altitude, and when laden with heavy bomber-hunting weapons as a replacement for the more vulnerable twin-engined &quot;Zerstörer&quot; heavy fighters, it suffered heavy losses. The Messerschmitt Bf 109 had comparable performance at high altitudes, but its lightweight airframe was even more greatly affected by increases in armament. The Mustang&#x27;s much lighter armament, tuned for antifighter combat, allowed it to overcome these single-engined opponents.

====Fighting the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;====
At the start of 1944, Major General James Doolittle, the new commander of the 8th Air Force, released most fighters from the requirement of flying in close formation with the bombers, allowing them free rein to attack the Luftwaffe wherever it could be found. The aim was to achieve air supremacy. Mustang groups were sent far ahead of the bombers in a &quot;fighter sweep&quot; to intercept German fighters. Bomber crews complained, but by June, supremacy was achieved.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; answered with the &quot;Gefechtsverband&quot; (&quot;battle formation&quot;). This consisted of a &quot;Sturmgruppe&quot; of heavily armed and armored Fw 190As escorted by two &quot;Begleitgruppen&quot; of Bf 109s, whose task was to keep the Mustangs away from the Fw 190s as they attacked the bombers. This strategy proved to be problematic, as the large German formation took a long time to assemble and was difficult to maneuver. It was often intercepted by the P-51 &quot;fighter sweeps&quot; before it could attack the bombers. However, German attacks against bombers could be effective when they did occur; the bomber-destroyer Fw 190As swept in from astern and often pressed their attacks to within .
While not always able to avoid contact with the escorts, the threat of mass attacks and later the &quot;company front&quot; (eight abreast) assaults by armored &quot;Sturmgruppe&quot; Fw 190As brought an urgency to attacking the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; wherever it could be found, either in the air or on the ground. Beginning in late February 1944, 8th Air Force fighter units began systematic strafing attacks on German airfields with increasing frequency and intensity throughout the spring, with the objective of gaining air supremacy over the Normandy battlefield. In general, these were conducted by units returning from escort missions, but beginning in March, many groups also were assigned airfield attacks instead of bomber support. The P-51, particularly with the advent of the K-14 gyro gunsight and the development of &quot;Clobber Colleges&quot; for the training of fighter pilots in fall 1944, was a decisive element in Allied countermeasures against the &quot;Jagdverbände&quot;.

The numerical superiority of the USAAF fighters, superb flying characteristics of the P-51, and pilot proficiency helped cripple the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s fighter force. As a result, the fighter threat to the US, and later British, bombers was greatly diminished by July 1944. The RAF, long proponents of night bombing for protection, were able to reopen daylight bombing in 1944 as a result of the crippling of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighter arm. Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, commander of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; during the war, was quoted as saying, &quot;When I saw Mustangs over Berlin, I knew the jig was up.&quot;

====Beyond Pointblank====
On 15 April 1944, VIII Fighter Command began &quot;Operation Jackpot&quot;, attacks on Luftwaffe fighter airfields. As the efficacy of these missions increased, the number of fighters at the German airbases fell to the point where they were no longer considered worthwhile targets. On 21 May, targets were expanded to include railways, locomotives, and other rolling stock used by the Germans to transport materiel and troops, in missions dubbed &quot;Chattanooga&quot;. The P-51 excelled at this mission, although losses were much higher on strafing missions than in air-to-air combat, partially because the Mustang&#x27;s liquid-cooled engine (particularly its liquid coolant system) was vulnerable to small-arms fire, unlike the air-cooled R-2800 radials of its Republic P-47 Thunderbolt stablemates based in England, regularly tasked with ground-strafing missions.
Given the overwhelming Allied air superiority, the Luftwaffe put its effort into the development of aircraft of such high performance that they could operate with impunity, but which also made bomber attack much more difficult, merely from the flight velocities they achieved. Foremost among these were the Messerschmitt Me 163B point-defense rocket interceptors, which started their operations with JG 400 near the end of July 1944, and the longer-endurance Messerschmitt Me 262A jet fighter, first flying with the &quot;Gruppe&quot;-strength Kommando Nowotny unit by the end of September 1944. In action, the Me 163 proved to be more dangerous to the Luftwaffe than to the Allies and was never a serious threat. The Me 262A was a serious threat, but attacks on their airfields neutralized them. The pioneering Junkers Jumo 004 axial-flow jet engines of the Me 262As needed careful nursing by their pilots, and these aircraft were particularly vulnerable during takeoff and landing. Lt. Chuck Yeager of the 357th Fighter Group was one of the first American pilots to shoot down an Me 262, which he caught during its landing approach. On 7 October 1944, Lt. Urban L. Drew of the 361st Fighter Group shot down two Me 262s that were taking off, while on the same day, Lt. Col. Hubert Zemke, who had transferred to the Mustang-equipped 479th Fighter Group, shot down what he thought was a Bf 109, only to have his gun camera film reveal that it may have been an Me 262. On 25 February 1945, Mustangs of the 55th Fighter Group surprised an entire &quot;Staffel&quot; of Me 262As at takeoff and destroyed six jets.

The Mustang also proved useful against the V-1s launched toward London. P-51B/Cs, using 150-octane fuel, were fast enough to catch the V-1 and operated in concert with shorter-range aircraft such as advanced marks of the Supermarine Spitfire and Hawker Tempest.

By 8 May 1945, the 8th, 9th, and 15th Air Force&#x27;s P-51 groups claimed some 4,950 aircraft shot down (about half of all USAAF claims in the European theater, the most claimed by any Allied fighter in air-to-air combat) and 4,131 destroyed on the ground. Losses were about 2,520 aircraft. The 8th Air Force&#x27;s 4th Fighter Group was the top-scoring fighter group in Europe, with 1,016 enemy aircraft claimed destroyed. This included 550 claimed in aerial combat and 466 on the ground.

In air combat, the top-scoring P-51 units (both of which exclusively flew Mustangs) were the 357th Fighter Group of the 8th Air Force with 565 air-to-air combat victories and the 9th Air Force&#x27;s 354th Fighter Group with 664, which made it one of the top-scoring fighter groups. The top Mustang ace was the USAAF&#x27;s George Preddy, whose final tally stood at 26.83 victories (a number that includes shared one half- and one third victory credits), 23 of which were scored with the P-51. Preddy was shot down and killed by friendly fire on Christmas Day 1944 during the Battle of the Bulge.

====In China and the Pacific Theater====

In early 1945, P-51C, D, and K variants also joined the Chinese Nationalist Air Force. These Mustangs were provided to the 3rd, 4th, and 5th Fighter Groups and used to attack Japanese targets in occupied areas of China. The P-51 became the most capable fighter in China, while the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force used the Nakajima Ki-84 &quot;Hayate&quot; against it.

The P-51 was a relative latecomer to the Pacific theater, due largely to the need for the aircraft in Europe, although the P-38&#x27;s twin-engined design was considered a safety advantage for long, over-water flights. The first P-51s were deployed in the Far East later in 1944, operating in close-support and escort missions, as well as tactical photoreconnaissance. As the war in Europe wound down, the P-51 became more common. With the capture of Iwo Jima, USAAF P-51 Mustang fighters of the VII Fighter Command were stationed on that island starting in March 1945, being initially tasked with escorting Boeing B-29 Superfortress missions against the Japanese homeland.

The command&#x27;s last major raid of May was a daylight incendiary attack on Yokohama on 29 May conducted by 517 B-29s escorted by 101 P-51s. This force was intercepted by 150 A6M Zero fighters, sparking an intense air battle in which five B-29s were shot down and another 175 damaged. In return, the P-51 pilots claimed 26 &quot;kills&quot; and 23 &quot;probables&quot; for the loss of three fighters. The 454 B-29s that reached Yokohama struck the city&#x27;s main business district and destroyed of buildings; over 1000 Japanese were killed. Overall, the attacks in May destroyed of buildings, which was equivalent to one-seventh of Japan&#x27;s total urban area. The minister of home affairs, Iwao Yamazaki, concluded after these raids that Japan&#x27;s civil defense arrangements were &quot;considered to be futile&quot;. On the first day of June, 521 B-29s escorted by 148 P-51s were dispatched in a daylight raid against Osaka. While en route to the city, the Mustangs flew through thick clouds, and 27 of the fighters were destroyed in collisions. Nevertheless, 458 heavy bombers and 27 P-51s reached the city, and the bombardment killed 3,960 Japanese and destroyed of buildings. On 5 June, 473 B-29s struck Kobe by day and destroyed of buildings for the loss of 11 bombers. A force of 409 B-29s attacked Osaka again on 7 June; during this attack, of buildings were burnt out and the Americans did not suffer any losses. Osaka was bombed for the fourth time that month, on 15 June, when 444 B-29s destroyed of the city and another of nearby Amagasaki; 300,000 houses were destroyed in Osaka. This attack marked the end of the first phase of XXI Bomber Command&#x27;s attack on Japan&#x27;s cities. During May and June, the bombers had destroyed much of the country&#x27;s six largest cities, killing between 112,000 and 126,762 people and rendering millions homeless. The widespread destruction and high number of casualties from these raids caused many Japanese to realize that their country&#x27;s military was no longer able to defend the home islands. American losses were low compared to Japanese casualties; 136 B-29s were downed during the campaign. In Tokyo, Osaka, Nagoya, Yokohama, Kobe, and Kawasaki, &quot;over 126,762 people were killed ... and a million and a half dwellings and over of urban space were destroyed.&quot; In Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya, &quot;the areas leveled (almost ) exceeded the areas destroyed in all German cities by both the American and British air forces (about ).&quot;

P-51s also conducted a series of independent ground-attack missions against targets in the home islands. The first of these operations took place on 16 April, when 57 P-51s strafed Kanoya Air Field in Kyushu. In operations conducted between 26 April and 22 June, the American fighter pilots claimed the destruction of 64 Japanese aircraft and damage to another 180 on the ground, as well as a further 10 shot down in flight; these claims were lower than the American planners had expected, however, and the raids were considered unsuccessful. USAAF losses were 11 P-51s to enemy action and seven to other causes.

Due to the lack of Japanese air opposition to the American bomber raids, VII Fighter Command was solely tasked with ground-attack missions from July. These raids were frequently made against airfields to destroy aircraft being held in reserve to attack the expected Allied invasion fleet. While the P-51 pilots only occasionally encountered Japanese fighters in the air, the airfields were protected by antiaircraft batteries and barrage balloons. By the end of the war, VII Fighter Command had conducted 51 ground-attack raids, of which 41 were considered successful. The fighter pilots claimed to have destroyed or damaged 1,062 aircraft and 254 ships, along with large numbers of buildings and railway rolling stock. American losses were 91 pilots killed and 157 Mustangs destroyed.

====Medal of Honor recipients====

Two P-51 pilots received the Medal of Honor during World War II:
*USAAF Lt Col. James H. Howard of the 356th Fighter Squadron, 354th Fighter Group was awarded the Medal of Honor for his action during a bomber escort mission near Oschersleben, Germany on 11 January 1944, flying P-51B, serial number nicknamed &quot;Ding Hao&quot;. Despite being outnumbered, Howard shot down three German planes and continued to defend the bombers even when his guns went out of action and fuel supply became dangerously low.
*USAAF Maj. William A. Shomo of the 82nd Reconnaissance Squadron, 71st Reconnaissance Group was awarded the Medal of Honor for his action during a mission over Luzon, Philippines on 11 January 1945, flying an F-6D, the armed photo reconnaissance variant of the P-51, serial number nicknamed &quot;Snooks the 5th&quot;. On that mission, Shomo shot down seven Japanese planes and became an &quot;ace in a day&quot;.

===Pilot observations===
Chief Naval Test Pilot and C.O. Captured Enemy Aircraft Flight Capt. Eric Brown, RN, tested the Mustang at RAE Farnborough in March 1944 and noted:
The U.S. Air Forces, Flight Test Engineering, assessed the Mustang B on 24 April 1944 thus:
Kurt Bühligen, the third-highest scoring German fighter pilot of World War II&#x27;s Western Front (with 112 confirmed victories, three against Mustangs), later stated:
German fighter ace Heinz Bär said that the P-51:
===After World War II===


In the aftermath of World War II, the USAAF consolidated much of its wartime combat force and selected the P-51 as a &quot;standard&quot; piston-engined fighter, while other types, such as the P-38 and P-47, were withdrawn or given substantially reduced roles. As the more advanced (P-80 and P-84) jet fighters were introduced, the P-51 was also relegated to secondary duties.

In 1947, the newly formed USAF Strategic Air Command employed Mustangs alongside F-6 Mustangs and F-82 Twin Mustangs, due to their range capabilities. In 1948, the designation P-51 (P for pursuit) was changed to &quot;F-51&quot; (&quot;F&quot; for fighter) and the existing &quot;F&quot; designator for photographic reconnaissance aircraft was dropped because of a new designation scheme throughout the USAF. Aircraft still in service in the USAF or Air National Guard (ANG) when the system was changed included: &quot;F-51B&quot;, &quot;F-51D&quot;, &quot;F-51K&quot;, &quot;RF-51D&quot; (formerly &quot;F-6D&quot;), &quot;RF-51K&quot; (formerly &quot;F-6K&quot;) and &quot;TRF-51D&quot; (two-seat trainer conversions of F-6Ds). They remained in service from 1946 through 1951. By 1950, although Mustangs continued in service with the USAF after the war, the majority of the USAF&#x27;s Mustangs had become surplus to requirements and placed in storage, while some were transferred to the Air Force Reserve and the ANG.

From the start of the Korean War, the Mustang once again proved useful. A &quot;substantial number&quot; of stored or in-service F-51Ds were shipped, via aircraft carriers, to the combat zone, and were used by the USAF, the South African Air Force, and the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF). The F-51 was used for ground attack, fitted with rockets and bombs, and photo reconnaissance, rather than being as interceptors or &quot;pure&quot; fighters, where it was already surpassed by early jets. After the first North Korean invasion, USAF units were forced to fly from bases in Japan and the F-51Ds, with their long range and endurance, could attack targets in Korea that short-ranged F-80 jets could not. Because of the vulnerable liquid cooling system, however, the F-51s sustained heavy losses to ground fire. Due to its lighter structure and a shortage of spare parts, the newer, faster F-51H was not used in Korea. On August 5, 1950, Major Louis J. Sebille of the 67th Fighter-Bomber Squadron attacked a North Korean armored column advancing on United Nations military units during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter. Though his aircraft was heavily damaged and he was wounded during the first pass on the column, he turned his F-51 around and deliberately crashed into the convoy at the cost of his life, and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.

Mustangs continued flying with USAF and ROKAF fighter-bomber units on close support and interdiction missions in Korea until 1953 when they were largely replaced as fighter-bombers by USAF F-84s and by United States Navy (USN) Grumman F9F Panthers. Other air forces and units using the Mustang included the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s 77 Squadron, which flew Australian-built Mustangs as part of British Commonwealth Forces Korea. The Mustangs were replaced by Gloster Meteor F8s in 1951. The South African Air Force&#x27;s 2 Squadron used U.S.-built Mustangs as part of the U.S. 18th Fighter Bomber Wing and had suffered heavy losses by 1953, after which 2 Squadron converted to the F-86 Sabre.

F-51s flew in the Air Force Reserve and ANG throughout the 1950s. The last American USAF Mustang was F-51D-30-NA AF serial no. , which was finally withdrawn from service with the West Virginia Air National Guard&#x27;s 167th Fighter Interceptor Squadron in January 1957 and retired to what was then called the Air Force Central Museum, although it was briefly reactivated to fly at the 50th anniversary of the Air Force Aerial Firepower Demonstration at the Air Proving Ground, Eglin AFB, Florida, on 6 May 1957. This aircraft, painted as P-51D-15-NA serial no. , is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, Wright-Patterson AFB, in Dayton, Ohio.

The final withdrawal of the Mustang from USAF dumped hundreds of P-51s onto the civilian market. The rights to the Mustang design were purchased from North American by the Cavalier Aircraft Corporation, which attempted to market the surplus Mustang aircraft in the U.S. and overseas. In 1967 and again in 1972, the USAF procured batches of remanufactured Mustangs from Cavalier, most of them destined for air forces in South America and Asia that were participating in the Military Assistance Program (MAP). These aircraft were remanufactured from existing original F-51D airframes fitted with new V-1650-7 engines, a new radio, tall F-51H-type vertical tails, and a stronger wing that could carry six machine guns and a total of eight underwing hardpoints. Two bombs and six rockets could be carried. They all had an original F-51D-type canopy but carried a second seat for an observer behind the pilot. One additional Mustang was a two-seat, dual-control TF-51D (67-14866) with an enlarged canopy and only four wing guns. Although these remanufactured Mustangs were intended for sale to South American and Asian nations through the MAP, they were delivered to the USAF with full USAF markings. They were, however, allocated new serial numbers (, and ).

The last U.S. military use of the F-51 was in 1968 when the U. S. Army employed a vintage F-51D (44-72990) as a chase aircraft for the Lockheed YAH-56 Cheyenne armed helicopter project. This aircraft was so successful that the Army ordered two F-51Ds from Cavalier in 1968 for use at Fort Rucker as chase planes. They were assigned the serials and . These F-51s had wingtip fuel tanks and were unarmed. Following the end of the Cheyenne program, these two chase aircraft were used for other projects. One of them (68-15795) was fitted with a 106 mm recoilless rifle for evaluation of the weapon&#x27;s value in attacking fortified ground targets. Cavalier Mustang 68-15796 survives at the Air Force Armament Museum, Eglin AFB, Florida, displayed indoors in World War II markings.

The F-51 was adopted by many foreign air forces and continued to be an effective fighter into the mid-1980s with smaller air arms. The last Mustang ever downed in battle occurred during Operation Power Pack in the Dominican Republic in 1965, with the last aircraft finally being retired by the Dominican Air Force in 1984.

===Service with other air forces===
After World War II, the P-51 Mustang served in the air arms of more than 25 nations. During the war, a Mustang cost about $51,000, while many hundreds were sold postwar for the nominal price of one dollar to signatories of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance, ratified in Rio de Janeiro in 1947.

These countries used the P-51 Mustang:

;Australia

:In November 1944, 3 Squadron RAAF became the first Royal Australian Air Force unit to use Mustangs. At the time of its conversion from the P-40 to the Mustang, the squadron was based in Italy with the RAF&#x27;s First Tactical Air Force.
:3 Squadron was renumbered 4 Squadron after returning to Australia from Italy, and converted to P-51Ds. Several other Australian or Pacific-based squadrons converted to either CAC-built Mustangs or to imported P-51Ks from July 1945, having been equipped with P-40s or Boomerangs for wartime service; these units were: 76, 77, 82, 83, 84 and 86 squadrons. Only 17 Mustangs reached the RAAF&#x27;s First Tactical Air Force front-line squadrons by the time World War II ended in August 1945.

:76, 77 and 82 squadrons were formed into 81 Fighter Wing of the British Commonwealth Air Force, which was part of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force stationed in Japan from February 1946. 77 Squadron used its P-51s extensively during the first months of the Korean War, before converting to Gloster Meteor jets.

:Five reserve units from the Citizen Air Force also operated Mustangs. 21 &quot;City of Melbourne&quot; Squadron, based in the state of Victoria; 22 &quot;City of Sydney&quot; Squadron, based in New South Wales; 23 &quot;City of Brisbane&quot; Squadron, based in Queensland; 24 &quot;City of Adelaide&quot; Squadron, based in South Australia; and 25 &quot;City of Perth&quot; Squadron, based in Western Australia; all of these units were equipped with CAC Mustangs, rather than P-51D or Ks. The last Mustangs were retired from these units in 1960 when CAF units adopted a nonflying role.

;Bolivia

: Nine Cavalier F-51D (including the two TF-51s) were given to Bolivia, under a program called Peace Condor.

;Canada 

:Canada had five squadrons equipped with Mustangs during World War II. RCAF 400, 414, and 430 squadrons flew Mustang Mk Is (1942–1944) and 441 and 442 squadrons flew Mustang Mk IIIs and IVAs in 1945. Postwar, a total of 150 Mustang P-51Ds were purchased and served in two regular (416 &quot;Lynx&quot; and 417 &quot;City of Windsor&quot;) and six auxiliary fighter squadrons (402 &quot;City of Winnipeg&quot;, 403 &quot;City of Calgary&quot;, 420 &quot;City of London&quot;, 424 &quot;City of Hamilton&quot;, 442 &quot;City of Vancouver&quot; and 443 &quot;City of New Westminster&quot;). The Mustangs were declared obsolete in 1956, but a number of special-duty versions served on into the early 1960s.

;Republic of China 

: The Chinese Nationalist Air Force obtained the P-51 during the late Sino-Japanese War to fight against the Japanese. After the war, Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s Nationalist government used the planes against insurgent Communist forces. The Nationalists retreated to Taiwan in 1949. Pilots supporting Chiang brought most of the Mustangs with them, where the aircraft became part of the island&#x27;s defense arsenal.

;People&#x27;s Republic of China

: The Communist Chinese captured 39 P-51s from the Nationalists while they were retreating to Taiwan. In August 1949, the People&#x27;s Liberation Army Air Force formed its first P-51 squadron at Beijing Nanyuan Airport and were tasked of the defending Beijing&#x27;s airspace from Nationalist Air Force aircraft. On 1 October 1949, when Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, nine P-51s conducted a fly-past during the military parade in Beijing. By 1950, when Soviet Union began supplying modern military equipment to China, surviving P-51s were relegated to PLAAF&#x27;s aviation school and 13 P-51s were modified as two-seat trainers. By September 1953, most P-51s were retired from service and only eight P-51s remained in service to teach Ilyushin Il-10 pilots on how to taxi aircraft.

;Costa Rica
:The Costa Rican Air Force flew four P-51Ds from 1955 to 1964. 

;Cuba
: In November 1958, three US-registered civilian P-51D Mustangs were illegally flown separately from Miami to Cuba, on delivery to the rebel forces of the 26th of July Movement, then headed by Fidel Castro during the Cuban Revolution. One of the Mustangs was damaged during delivery and none of them were used operationally. After the success of the revolution in January 1959, with other rebel aircraft plus those of the existing Cuban government forces, they were adopted into the Fuerza Aérea Revolucionaria. Due to increasing U.S. restrictions and lack of spares and maintenance experience, they never achieved operational status. At the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion, the two intact Mustangs were already effectively grounded at Campo Columbia and at Santiago. After the failed invasion, they were placed on display with other symbols of &quot;revolutionary struggle&quot; and one remains on display at the Museo del Aire.

;Dominican Republic 
: The Dominican Republic was the largest Latin American air force to employ the P-51D, with six aircraft acquired in 1948, 44 ex-Swedish F-51Ds purchased in 1948, and a further Mustang obtained from an unknown source. It was the last nation to have any Mustangs in service, with some remaining in use as late as 1984. Nine of the final 10 aircraft were sold back to American collectors in 1988.

;El Salvador 
: The Salvadoran Air Force (&quot;Fuerza Aérea Salvadoreña&quot; or FAS) purchased five Cavalier Mustang IIs (and one dual-control Cavalier TF-51) that featured wingtip fuel tanks to increase combat range and up-rated Merlin engines. Seven P-51D Mustangs were also in service. They were used during the 1969 Football War against Honduras, the last time the P-51 was used in combat. One of them, FAS-404, was shot down by a Vought F4U-5 Corsair flown by Captain Fernando Soto in the last aerial combat between piston-engined fighters in the world.

;France
: In late 1944, the first French unit began its transition to reconnaissance Mustangs. In January 1945, the Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron 2/33 of the French Air Force took their F-6Cs and F-6Ds over Germany on photographic mapping missions. The Mustangs remained in service until the early 1950s, when they were replaced by jet fighters.

;Germany
: Several P-51s were captured by the Luftwaffe as &quot;Beuteflugzeug&quot; (&quot;captured aircraft&quot;) following crash landings. These aircraft were subsequently repaired and test-flown by the &quot;Zirkus Rosarius&quot;, or &quot;Rosarius Staffel&quot;, the official &quot;Erprobungskommando&quot; of the Luftwaffe High Command, for combat evaluation at Göttingen. The aircraft were repainted with German markings and bright yellow noses, tails, and bellies for identification. A number of P-51B/P-51Cs – including examples marked with Luftwaffe &quot;Geschwaderkennung&quot; codes T9+CK, T9+FK, T9+HK, and T9+PK (with the &quot;T9&quot; prefix not known to be officially assigned to any existing Luftwaffe formation from their own records, outside of the photos of &quot;Zirkus Rosarius&quot;–flown aircraft)—with a total of three captured P-51Ds were also flown by the unit. Some of these P-51s were found by Allied forces at the end of the war; others crashed during testing. The Mustang is also listed in the appendix to the novel &quot;KG 200&quot; as having been flown by the German secret operations unit KG 200, which tested, evaluated, and sometimes clandestinely operated captured enemy aircraft during World War II.

;Guatemala

: The Guatemalan Air Force had 30 P-51D Mustangs in service from 1954 to the early 1970s.

;Haiti 
: Haiti had four P-51D Mustangs when President Paul Eugène Magloire was in power from 1950 to 1956, with the last retired in 1973–1974 and sold for spares to the Dominican Republic.

;Indonesia

: Indonesia acquired 26 P-51D/Ks from the departing Netherlands East Indies Air Force in 1949–1950 and later received 35 P-51Ds from the United States in 1960–1961. The Mustangs were used against numerous rebellions during the 1950s, such as the CIA-backed Permesta rebels in 1958–1961. During this period, the Mustang scored the first and (as of 2022) the only aerial victory of the Indonesian Air Force, when on 18 May 1958, a P-51D Mustang piloted by Capt. Ignatius Dewanto shot down a Permesta&#x27;s Revolutionary Air Force B-26 Invader piloted by Allen Lawrence Pope near Ambon. They were also used against Commonwealth (RAF, RAAF, and RNZAF) forces during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation in the early 1960s. Indonesia received a shipment of five or seven Cavalier II Mustangs and one TF-51D (without tip tanks) delivered in 1972–1973 as part of &quot;Peace Pony&quot; program under the Mutual Defense Assistance Act. The last time Mustangs were deployed for military purposes was during the &quot;Wibawa V&quot; exercise at Mount Lawu, Magetan in February 1975. The Indonesian Mustangs were also used for filming &quot;Janur Kuning&quot;, which was released in 1980. The Mustangs were replaced in 1976.

;Israel

: A few P-51 Mustangs were illegally bought by Israel in 1948, crated, and smuggled into the country as agricultural equipment for use in the 1947–1949 Palestine war, serving alongside upwards of 23 Avia S-199 fighters (Czech-built Messerschmitt Bf 109Gs) in Israeli service, with the Mustangs quickly establishing themselves as the best fighter in the Israeli inventory. Further aircraft were bought from Sweden and were replaced by jets at the end of the 1950s, but not before the type was used in the Suez Crisis, at the opening of Operation Kadesh. In conjunction with a surprise parachute drop at the Mitla Pass, four P-51s were specially detailed to cut telephone and telegraph wires using their wings in extreme low level runs, which resulted in major interruptions to Egyptian communications.

;Italy 

: Italy was a postwar operator of P-51Ds; deliveries were slowed by the Korean War, but between September 1947 and January 1951, by MDAP count, 173 examples were delivered. They were used in all the AMI fighter units: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 51 &quot;Stormo&quot; (wing), plus some employed in schools and experimental units. Considered a &quot;glamorous&quot; fighter, P-51s were even used as personal aircraft by several Italian commanders. Some restrictions were placed on its use due to unfavorable flying characteristics. Handling had to be done with much care when fuel tanks were fully used, and several aerobatic maneuvers were forbidden. Overall, the P-51D was highly rated even compared to the other primary postwar fighter in Italian service, the Supermarine Spitfire, partly because these P-51Ds were in very good condition in contrast to all other Allied fighters supplied to Italy. Phasing out of the Mustang began in summer 1958.

;Japan 
: The P-51C-11-NT &quot;Evalina&quot;, marked as &quot;278&quot; (former USAAF serial: ) and flown by 26th FS, 51st FG, was hit by gunfire on 16 January 1945 and belly-landed on Suchon Airfield in China, which was held by the Japanese. The Japanese repaired the aircraft, roughly applied Hinomaru roundels and flew the aircraft to the Fussa evaluation center (now Yokota Air Base) in Japan.

;Netherlands

: The Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force received 40 P-51Ds and flew them in the course of the Indonesian National Revolution, particularly during the two Dutch police actions: Operation Product in 1947 and Operation Kraai in 1948–1949. When the conflict was over, Indonesia received 26 of these Mustangs.

;New Zealand

:New Zealand ordered 370 P-51 Mustangs to supplement its F4U Corsairs in the Pacific Ocean Areas theater. Scheduled deliveries were for an initial batch of 30 P-51Ds, followed by 137 more P-51Ds and 203 P-51Ms. The original 30 were being shipped as the war ended in August 1945; these were stored in their packing cases, and the order for the additional Mustangs was canceled. In 1951, the stored Mustangs entered service in 1 (Auckland), 2 (Wellington), 3 (Canterbury), and 4 (Otago) squadrons of the Territorial Air Force (TAF). The Mustangs remained in service until they were prematurely retired in August 1955 following a series of problems with undercarriage and coolant-system corrosion problems. Four Mustangs served on as target tugs until the TAF was disbanded in 1957. RNZAF pilots in the Royal Air Force also flew the P-51 and at least one New Zealand pilot scored victories over Europe while on loan to a USAAF P-51 squadron.

;Nicaragua 
: The Nicaraguan National Guard purchased 26 P-51D Mustangs from Sweden in 1954 and later received 30 P-51D Mustangs from the U.S. together with two TF-51 models from MAP after 1954. All aircraft of this type were retired from service by 1964.

;Philippines

:The Philippines acquired 103 P-51D Mustangs after World War II, operated by the 6th &quot;Cobras&quot;, 7th &quot;Bulldogs&quot; and 8th &quot;Scorpions&quot; tactical fighter squadrons of the 5th Fighter Wing. These became the backbone of the postwar Philippine Army Air Corps and Philippine Air Force, and were used extensively during the Huk campaign, fighting against communist insurgents, as well as the suppression of Moro rebels led by Hadji Kamlon in southern Philippines until 1955. The Mustangs were also the first aircraft of the Philippine air demonstration team, which was formed in 1953 and given the name the &quot;Blue Diamonds&quot; the following year. The Mustangs were replaced by 56 F-86 Sabres in the late 1950s, but some were still in service for COIN roles up to the early 1980s.

;Poland
:During World War II, five Polish Air Force in Great Britain squadrons used Mustangs. The first Polish unit equipped (7 June 1942) with Mustang Mk Is was &quot;B&quot; Flight of 309 &quot;Ziemi Czerwieńskiej&quot; Squadron (an Army Co-Operation Command unit), followed by &quot;A&quot; Flight in March 1943. Subsequently, 309 Squadron was redesignated a fighter/reconnaissance unit and became part of Fighter Command. On 13 March 1944, 316 &quot;&quot;Warszawski&quot; Squadron received their first Mustang Mk IIIs; rearming of the unit was completed by the end of April. By 26 March 1944, 306 &quot;Toruński&quot; Sqn and 315 &quot;Dębliński&quot; Sqn received Mustangs Mk IIIs (the whole operation took 12 days). On 20 October 1944, Mustang Mk Is in 309 Squadron were replaced by Mk IIIs. On 11 December 1944, the unit was again renamed, becoming 309 &quot;Dywizjon Myśliwski&quot; &quot;Ziemi Czerwieńskiej&quot;&quot; or 309 &quot;Land of Czerwien&quot; Polish Fighter Squadron. In 1945, 303 &quot;Kościuszko&quot; Sqn received 20 Mustangs Mk IV/Mk IVA replacements. Postwar, between 6 December 1946 and 6 January 1947, all five Polish squadrons equipped with Mustangs were disbanded. Poland returned about 80 Mustang Mk IIIs and 20 Mustangs Mk IV/IVAs to the RAF, which transferred them to the U.S. government.

;Somalia
: The Somalian Air Force operated eight P-51Ds in post-World War II service.

;South Africa

:No.5 Squadron South African Air Force operated a number of Mustang Mk IIIs (P-51B/C) and Mk IVs (P-51D/K) in Italy during World War II, beginning in September 1944, when the squadron converted to the Mustang Mk III from Kittyhawks. The Mk IV and Mk IVA came into SA service in March 1945. These aircraft were generally camouflaged in the British style, having been drawn from RAF stocks; all carried RAF serial numbers and were struck off charge and scrapped in October 1945. In 1950, 2 Squadron SAAF was supplied with F-51D Mustangs by the United States for Korean War service. The type performed well in South African hands before being replaced by the F-86 Sabre in 1952 and 1953.

;South Korea

:Within a month of the outbreak of the Korean War, 10 F-51D Mustangs were provided to the badly depleted Republic of Korea Air Force as a part of the Bout One Project. They were flown by both South Korean airmen, several of whom were veterans of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy air services during World War II, as well as by U.S. advisers led by Major Dean Hess. Later, more were provided both from U.S. and from South African stocks, as the latter were converting to F-86 Sabres. They formed the backbone of the South Korean Air Force until they were replaced by Sabres.
:It also served with the ROKAF Black Eagles aerobatic team, until retired in 1954.

;Sweden

:Sweden&#x27;s &quot;Flygvapnet&quot; first recuperated four of the P-51s (two P-51Bs and two early P-51Ds) that had been diverted to Sweden during missions over Europe. In February 1945, Sweden purchased 50 P-51Ds designated J 26, which were delivered by American pilots in April and assigned to the Uppland Wing (F 16) at Uppsala as interceptors. In early 1946, the Jämtland Wing (F 4) at Östersund was equipped with a second batch of 90 P-51Ds. A final batch of 21 Mustangs was purchased in 1948. In all, 161 J 26s served in the Swedish Air Force during the late 1940s. About 12 were modified for photo reconnaissance and redesignated S 26. Some of these aircraft participated in the secret Swedish mapping of new Soviet military installations at the Baltic coast in 1946–47 (&quot;Operation Falun&quot;), an endeavor that entailed many intentional violations of Soviet airspace. However, the Mustang could outdive any Soviet fighter of that era, so no S 26s were lost in these missions. The J 26s were replaced by De Havilland Vampires around 1950. The S 26s were replaced by S 29Cs in the early 1950s.

;Switzerland 

:The Swiss Air Force operated a few USAAF P-51s that had been impounded by Swiss authorities during World War II after the pilots were forced to land in neutral Switzerland. After the war, Switzerland also bought 130 P-51s for $4,000 each. They served until 1958.

;Soviet Union
: The Soviet Union received at least 10 early-model ex-RAF Mustang Mk Is and tested them, but found them to &quot;under-perform&quot; compared to contemporary USSR fighters, relegating them to training units. Later Lend-Lease deliveries of the P-51B/C and D series, along with other Mustangs abandoned in Russia after the famous &quot;shuttle missions&quot;, were repaired and used by the Soviet Air Force, but not in front-line service.

;Uruguay 
: The Uruguayan Air Force used 25 P-51D Mustangs from 1950 to 1960; some were subsequently sold to Bolivia.

===P-51s and civil aviation===
Many P-51s were sold as surplus after the war, often for as little as $1,500. Some were sold to former wartime fliers or other aficionados for personal use, while others were modified for air racing.

One of the most significant Mustangs involved in air racing was serial number , a surplus P-51C-10-NT purchased by film stunt pilot Paul Mantz. He modified the wings, sealing them to create a giant fuel tank in each one; these &quot;wet wings&quot; reduced the need for fuel stops or drag-inducing drop tanks. Named &quot;Blaze of Noon&quot; after the film &quot;Blaze of Noon&quot;, the aircraft won the 1946 and 1947 Bendix Air Races, took second in the 1948 Bendix, and placed third in the 1949 Bendix. Mantz also set a U.S. coast-to-coast record in 1947. He sold the Mustang to Charles F. Blair Jr (future husband of Maureen O&#x27;Hara), who renamed it &quot;Excalibur III&quot; and used it to set a New York-to-London (about ) record in 1951: 7 hr 48 min from takeoff at Idlewild to overhead London Airport. Later that year, Blair flew from Norway to Fairbanks, Alaska, via the North Pole (about ), proving that navigation via sun sights was possible over the magnetic North Pole region. For this feat, he was awarded the Harmon Trophy and the Air Force was forced to change its thoughts on a possible Soviet air strike from the north. This Mustang now sits in the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.
In 1958, the RCAF retired its 78 remaining Mustangs. RCAF pilot Lynn Garrison ferried them from their various storage locations to Canastota, New York, where the American buyers were based. Garrison flew each of the surviving aircraft at least once. These aircraft make up a large percentage of the aircraft presently flying worldwide.

The most prominent firm to convert Mustangs to civilian use was Trans-Florida Aviation, later renamed Cavalier Aircraft Corporation, which produced the Cavalier Mustang. Modifications included a taller tailfin and wingtip tanks. A number of conversions included a Cavalier Mustang specialty: a &quot;tight&quot; second seat added in the space formerly occupied by the military radio and fuselage fuel tank.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, when the United States Department of Defense wished to supply aircraft to South American countries and later Indonesia for close air support and counterinsurgency, it paid Cavalier to return some of their civilian conversions back to updated military specifications.

In the 21st century, a P-51 can command a price of more than $1 million, even for only partially restored aircraft. There were 204 privately owned P-51s in the U.S. on the FAA registry in 2011, most of which are still flying, often associated with organizations such as the Commemorative Air Force (formerly the Confederate Air Force).

In May 2013, Doug Matthews set an altitude record of in a P-51 named &quot;The Rebel&quot; for piston-powered aircraft weighing . Flying from a grass runway at Florida&#x27;s Indiantown airport and over Lake Okeechobee, Matthews set world records for time to reach altitudes of , 18 minutes and , 31 minutes. He set a level-flight altitude record of in level flight and an absolute altitude record of , breaking the previous record of set in 1954.

==== Incidents ====
* On 9 June 1973, William Penn Patrick (43) a certified pilot and his passenger, Christian Hagert, died when Patrick&#x27;s P-51 Mustang crashed in Lakeport, California.
* On 1 July 1990 at the National Capital Air Show (Ottawa, Ontario, Canada), Harry E. Tope was killed when his P-51 Mustang crashed.
* On 16 September 2011 &quot;The Galloping Ghost&quot;, a modified P-51 piloted by Jimmy Leeward of Ocala, Florida, crashed during an air race in Reno, Nevada. Leeward and at least nine people on the ground were killed when the racer suddenly crashed near the edge of the grandstand.

==Variants==

Over 20 variants of the P-51 Mustang were produced from 1940 to after the war.

===Production===
Except for the small numbers assembled or produced in Australia, all Mustangs were built by North American initially at Inglewood, California, but then additionally in Dallas, Texas.

*&quot;Red Tail Reborn&quot; (2007) is the story behind the restoration of a flying memorial aircraft.

==Scale replicas==
As indicative of the iconic nature of the P-51, manufacturers within the hobby industry have created scale plastic model kits of the P-51 Mustang, with varying degrees of detail and skill levels. The aircraft have also been the subject of numerous scale flying replicas. Aside from the popular model aircraft, several kitplane manufacturers offer ½, ⅔, and ¾-scale replicas capable of comfortably seating one (or even two) and offering high performance combined with more forgiving flight characteristics. Such aircraft include the Titan T-51 Mustang, W.A.R. P-51 Mustang, Linn Mini Mustang, Jurca Gnatsum, Thunder Mustang, Stewart S-51D Mustang, Loehle 5151 Mustang and ScaleWings SW51 Mustang.

<doc id="24714" wikidata="Q104225" url="?curid=24714" title="Precession">
<text>Precession is a change in the orientation of the rotational axis of a rotating body. In an appropriate reference frame it can be defined as a change in the first Euler angle, whereas the third Euler angle defines the rotation itself. In other words, if the axis of rotation of a body is itself rotating about a second axis, that body is said to be precessing about the second axis. A motion in which the second Euler angle changes is called &quot;nutation&quot;. In physics, there are two types of precession: torque-free and torque-induced.

In astronomy, &quot;precession&quot; refers to any of several slow changes in an astronomical body&#x27;s rotational or orbital parameters. An important example is the steady change in the orientation of the axis of rotation of the Earth, known as the precession of the equinoxes.

==Torque-free or torque neglected==
Torque-free precession implies that no external moment (torque) is applied to the body. In torque-free precession, the angular momentum is a constant, but the angular velocity vector changes orientation with time. What makes this possible is a time-varying moment of inertia, or more precisely, a time-varying inertia matrix. The inertia matrix is composed of the moments of inertia of a body calculated with respect to separate coordinate axes (e.g. , , ). If an object is asymmetric about its principal axis of rotation, the moment of inertia with respect to each coordinate direction will change with time, while preserving angular momentum. The result is that the component of the angular velocities of the body about each axis will vary inversely with each axis&#x27; moment of inertia.

The torque-free precession rate of an object with an axis of symmetry, such as a disk, spinning about an axis not aligned with that axis of symmetry can be calculated as follows:
formula_1
where is the precession rate, is the spin rate about the axis of symmetry, is the moment of inertia about the axis of symmetry, is moment of inertia about either of the other two equal perpendicular principal axes, and is the angle between the moment of inertia direction and the symmetry axis.

When an object is not perfectly rigid, inelastic dissipation will tend to damp torque-free precession, and the rotation axis will align itself with one of the inertia axes of the body.

For a generic solid object without any axis of symmetry, the evolution of the object&#x27;s orientation, represented (for example) by a rotation matrix that transforms internal to external coordinates, may be numerically simulated. Given the object&#x27;s fixed internal moment of inertia tensor and fixed external angular momentum , the instantaneous angular velocity is
formula_2
Precession occurs by repeatedly recalculating and applying a small rotation vector for the short time ; e.g.:
formula_3
for the skew-symmetric matrix . The errors induced by finite time steps tend to increase the rotational kinetic energy:
formula_4
this unphysical tendency can be counteracted by repeatedly applying a small rotation vector perpendicular to both and , noting that
formula_5

==Torque-induced==
Torque-induced precession (gyroscopic precession) is the phenomenon in which the axis of a spinning object (e.g., a gyroscope) describes a cone in space when an external torque is applied to it. The phenomenon is commonly seen in a spinning toy top, but all rotating objects can undergo precession. If the speed of the rotation and the magnitude of the external torque are constant, the spin axis will move at right angles to the direction that would intuitively result from the external torque. In the case of a toy top, its weight is acting downwards from its center of mass and the normal force (reaction) of the ground is pushing up on it at the point of contact with the support. These two opposite forces produce a torque which causes the top to precess.
The device depicted on the right is gimbal mounted. From inside to outside there are three axes of rotation: the hub of the wheel, the gimbal axis, and the vertical pivot.

To distinguish between the two horizontal axes, rotation around the wheel hub will be called &quot;spinning&quot;, and rotation around the gimbal axis will be called &quot;pitching&quot;. Rotation around the vertical pivot axis is called &quot;rotation&quot;.

First, imagine that the entire device is rotating around the (vertical) pivot axis. Then, spinning of the wheel (around the wheelhub) is added. Imagine the gimbal axis to be locked, so that the wheel cannot pitch. The gimbal axis has sensors, that measure whether there is a torque around the gimbal axis.

In the picture, a section of the wheel has been named . At the depicted moment in time, section is at the perimeter of the rotating motion around the (vertical) pivot axis. Section , therefore, has a lot of angular rotating velocity with respect to the rotation around the pivot axis, and as is forced closer to the pivot axis of the rotation (by the wheel spinning further), because of the Coriolis effect, with respect to the vertical pivot axis, tends to move in the direction of the top-left arrow in the diagram (shown at 45°) in the direction of rotation around the pivot axis. Section of the wheel is moving away from the pivot axis, and so a force (again, a Coriolis force) acts in the same direction as in the case of . Note that both arrows point in the same direction.

The same reasoning applies for the bottom half of the wheel, but there the arrows point in the opposite direction to that of the top arrows. Combined over the entire wheel, there is a torque around the gimbal axis when some spinning is added to rotation around a vertical axis.

It is important to note that the torque around the gimbal axis arises without any delay; the response is instantaneous.

In the discussion above, the setup was kept unchanging by preventing pitching around the gimbal axis. In the case of a spinning toy top, when the spinning top starts tilting, gravity exerts a torque. However, instead of rolling over, the spinning top just pitches a little. This pitching motion reorients the spinning top with respect to the torque that is being exerted. The result is that the torque exerted by gravity – via the pitching motion – elicits gyroscopic precession (which in turn yields a counter torque against the gravity torque) rather than causing the spinning top to fall to its side.

Precession or gyroscopic considerations have an effect on bicycle performance at high speed. Precession is also the mechanism behind gyrocompasses.

===Classical (Newtonian)===

Precession is the change of angular velocity and angular momentum produced by a torque. The general equation that relates the torque to the rate of change of angular momentum is:
formula_6
where formula_7 and formula_8 are the torque and angular momentum vectors respectively.

Due to the way the torque vectors are defined, it is a vector that is perpendicular to the plane of the forces that create it. Thus it may be seen that the angular momentum vector will change perpendicular to those forces. Depending on how the forces are created, they will often rotate with the angular momentum vector, and then circular precession is created.

Under these circumstances the angular velocity of precession is given by: 

:formula_9

where is the moment of inertia, is the angular velocity of spin about the spin axis, is the mass, is the acceleration due to gravity, is the angle between the spin axis and the axis of precession and is the distance between the center of mass and the pivot. The torque vector originates at the center of mass. Using , we find that the period of precession is given by:
formula_10

Where is the moment of inertia, is the period of spin about the spin axis, and is the torque. In general, the problem is more complicated than this, however.

===Relativistic (Einsteinian) ===

The special and general theories of relativity give three types of corrections to the Newtonian precession, of a gyroscope near a large mass such as Earth, described above. They are:
* Thomas precession, a special-relativistic correction accounting for an object (such as a gyroscope) being accelerated along a curved path.
* de Sitter precession, a general-relativistic correction accounting for the Schwarzschild metric of curved space near a large non-rotating mass.
* Lense–Thirring precession, a general-relativistic correction accounting for the frame dragging by the Kerr metric of curved space near a large rotating mass.

The Schwarzschild geodesics (sometimes Schwarzschild precession) is used in the prediction of the anomalous perihelion precession of the planets, most notably for the accurate prediction of the apsidal precession of Mercury.

== Astronomy ==

In astronomy, precession refers to any of several gravity-induced, slow and continuous changes in an astronomical body&#x27;s rotational axis or orbital path. Precession of the equinoxes, perihelion precession, changes in the tilt of Earth&#x27;s axis to its orbit, and the eccentricity of its orbit over tens of thousands of years are all important parts of the astronomical theory of ice ages. &quot;(See Milankovitch cycles.)&quot;

=== Axial precession (precession of the equinoxes) ===
Axial precession is the movement of the rotational axis of an astronomical body, whereby the axis slowly traces out a cone. In the case of Earth, this type of precession is also known as the &quot;precession of the equinoxes&quot;, &quot;lunisolar precession&quot;, or &quot;precession of the equator&quot;. Earth goes through one such complete precessional cycle in a period of approximately 26,000 years or 1° every 72 years, during which the positions of stars will slowly change in both equatorial coordinates and ecliptic longitude. Over this cycle, Earth&#x27;s north axial pole moves from where it is now, within 1° of Polaris, in a circle around the ecliptic pole, with an angular radius of about 23.5°.

The ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus (c. 190–120 BC) is generally accepted to be the earliest known astronomer to recognize and assess the precession of the equinoxes at about 1° per century (which is not far from the actual value for antiquity, 1.38°), although there is some minor dispute about whether he was. In ancient China, the Jin-dynasty scholar-official Yu Xi ( 307–345 AD) made a similar discovery centuries later, noting that the position of the Sun during the winter solstice had drifted roughly one degree over the course of fifty years relative to the position of the stars. The precession of Earth&#x27;s axis was later explained by Newtonian physics. Being an oblate spheroid, Earth has a non-spherical shape, bulging outward at the equator. The gravitational tidal forces of the Moon and Sun apply torque to the equator, attempting to pull the equatorial bulge into the plane of the ecliptic, but instead causing it to precess. The torque exerted by the planets, particularly Jupiter, also plays a role.

===Apsidal precession===
The orbits of planets around the Sun do not really follow an identical ellipse each time, but actually trace out a flower-petal shape because the major axis of each planet&#x27;s elliptical orbit also precesses within its orbital plane, partly in response to perturbations in the form of the changing gravitational forces exerted by other planets. This is called perihelion precession or apsidal precession.

In the adjunct image, Earth&#x27;s apsidal precession is illustrated. As the Earth travels around the Sun, its elliptical orbit rotates gradually over time. The eccentricity of its ellipse and the precession rate of its orbit are exaggerated for visualization. Most orbits in the Solar System have a much smaller eccentricity and precess at a much slower rate, making them nearly circular and nearly stationary.

Discrepancies between the observed perihelion precession rate of the planet Mercury and that predicted by classical mechanics were prominent among the forms of experimental evidence leading to the acceptance of Einstein&#x27;s Theory of Relativity (in particular, his General Theory of Relativity), which accurately predicted the anomalies. Deviating from Newton&#x27;s law, Einstein&#x27;s theory of gravitation predicts an extra term of , which accurately gives the observed excess turning rate of 43 arcseconds every 100 years.

===Nodal precession===

Orbital nodes also precess over time.

<text>Punjab (; ; also romanised as Panjāb or Panj-Āb), also known as the Land of the Five Rivers, is a geopolitical, cultural, and historical region in South Asia. It is located in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent, comprising areas of modern-day eastern-Pakistan and northwestern-India. Punjab&#x27;s major cities are Lahore, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Multan, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Chandigarh, Jalandhar, Sialkot, Patiala, Mohali, Bathinda, and Bahawalpur.

Punjab grew out of the settlements along the five rivers, which served as an important route to the Near East as early as the ancient Indus Valley civilization, dating back to , followed by migrations of the Indo-Aryan peoples. Agriculture has been the chief economic feature of the Punjab and formed the foundation of Punjabi culture. The Punjab emerged as an important agricultural region, especially following the Green Revolution during the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, and has been described as the &quot;breadbasket of both India and Pakistan.&quot;

Punjab&#x27;s history is a tapestry of conflict, marked by the rise of indigenous dynasties and empires. Following Alexander the Great&#x27;s invasion in the 4th century BCE, Chandragupta Maurya allied with Punjabi republics to establish the Maurya Empire. Successive reigns of the Indo-Greek Kingdom, Kushan Empire, and Indo-Scythians followed, but were ultimately defeated by Eastern Punjab Janapadas such as the Yaudheya, Trigarta Kingdom, Audumbaras, Arjunayanas, and Kuninda Kingdom. In the 5th and 6th centuries CE, Punjab faced devastating Hunnic invasions, yet the Vardhana dynasty emerged triumphant, ruling over Northern India. The 8th century CE witnessed the Hindu Shahis rise, known for defeating the Saffarid dynasty and the Samanid Empire. Concurrently, the Tomara dynasty and Katoch Dynasty controlled eastern Punjab, resisting Ghaznavid invasions. Islam took hold in Western Punjab under Ghaznavid rule. The Delhi Sultanate then succeeded the Ghaznavids in which the Tughlaq dynasty and Sayyid dynasty Sultans are described as Punjabi origin. The 15th century saw the emergence of the Langah Sultanate in south Punjab, acclaimed for its victory over the Lodi dynasty. After the Mughal Empire&#x27;s decline in the 18th century, Punjab experienced a period of anarchy. In 1799 CE, the Sikh Empire established its rule, undertaking conquests into Kashmir and Durrani Empire held territories, shaping the diverse and complex history of Punjab.

The boundaries of the region are ill-defined and focus on historical accounts and thus the geographical definition of the term &quot;Punjab&quot; has changed over time. In the 16th century Mughal Empire the Punjab region was divided into three, with the Lahore Subah in the west, the Delhi Subah in the east and the Multan Subah in the south. Under the British Raj until the Partition of India in 1947, the Punjab Province encompassed the present Indian states and union territories of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Chandigarh, and Delhi, and the Pakistani regions of Punjab, and Islamabad Capital Territory.

The predominant ethnolinguistic group of the Punjab region are the Punjabi people, who speak the Indo-Aryan Punjabi language. Punjabi Muslims are the majority in West Punjab (Pakistan), while Punjabi Sikhs are the majority in East Punjab (India). Other religious groups include Hinduism, Christianity, Jainism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, and Ravidassia.

==Etymology==
The name Punjab is of Persian origin, with its two parts ( and ) being cognates of the Sanskrit words and , of the same meaning. The word &quot;pañjāb&quot; is thus calque of Indo-Aryan &quot;pañca-áp&quot; and means &quot;The Land of Five Waters&quot;, referring to the rivers Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas. All are tributaries of the Indus River, the Sutlej being the largest. References to a land of five rivers may be found in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, in which one of the regions is named as &quot;Panchanada&quot; (). Earlier, the Punjab was known as Sapta Sindhu in the Rigveda or &quot;Hapta Hendu&quot; in Avesta, translating into &quot;The Land of Seven Rivers&quot;, with the other two being Indus and Kabul. The ancient Greeks referred to the region as &quot;Pentapotamía&quot; (), which has the same meaning as that of Punjab.

== History ==

=== Ancient period ===
The Punjab region is noted as the site of one of the earliest urban societies, the Indus Valley Civilization which flourished from about and declined rapidly 1,000 years later, following the Indo-Aryan migrations that overran the region in waves between and . Frequent intertribal wars stimulated the growth of larger groupings ruled by chieftains and kings, who ruled local kingdoms known as Mahajanapadas. The rise of kingdoms and dynasties in the Punjab is chronicled in the ancient Hindu epics, particularly the Mahabharata. The epic battles described in the &quot;Mahabharata&quot; are chronicled as being fought in what is now the state of Haryana and historic Punjab. The Gandharas, Kambojas, Trigartas, Andhra, Pauravas, Bahlikas (Bactrian settlers of the Punjab), Yaudheyas, and others sided with the Kauravas in the great battle fought at Kurukshetra. According to Fauja Singh and L.M. Joshi: &quot;There is no doubt that the Kambojas, Daradas, Kaikayas, Andhra, Pauravas, Yaudheyas, Malavas, Saindhavas, and Kurus had jointly contributed to the heroic tradition and composite culture of ancient Punjab.&quot;

==== Invasions of Alexander the Great (c. 4th century BCE) ====
The earliest known notable local king of this region was known as King Porus, who fought the famous Battle of the Hydaspes against Alexander the Great. His kingdom spanned between rivers &quot;Hydaspes&quot; (Jhelum) and &quot;Acesines&quot; (Chenab); Strabo had held the territory to contain almost 300 cities. He (alongside Abisares) had a hostile relationship with the Kingdom of Taxila which was ruled by his extended family. When the armies of Alexander crossed the Indus in its eastward migration, probably in Udabhandapura, he was greeted by the ruler of Taxila, Omphis. Omphis had hoped to force both Porus and Abisares into submission leveraging the might of Alexander&#x27;s forces and diplomatic missions were mounted, but while Abisares accepted the submission, Porus refused. This led Alexander to seek for a face-off with Porus. Thus began the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BCE; the exact site remains unknown. The battle is thought to be resulted in a decisive Greek victory; however, A. B. Bosworth warns against an uncritical reading of Greek sources that were exaggerated.

Alexander later founded two cities—&quot;Nicaea&quot; at the site of victory and &quot;Bucephalous&quot; at the battle-ground, in memory of his horse, who died soon after the battle. Later, tetradrachms would be minted depicting Alexander on horseback, armed with a &quot;sarissa&quot; and attacking a pair of Indians on an elephant. Porus refused to surrender and wandered about atop an elephant, until he was wounded and his force routed. When asked by Alexander how he wished to be treated, Porus replied &quot;Treat me as a king would treat another king&quot;. Despite the apparently one-sided results, Alexander was impressed by Porus and chose to not depose him. Not only was his territory reinstated but also expanded with Alexander&#x27;s forces annexing the territories of Glausaes, who ruled to the northeast of Porus&#x27; kingdom.

After Alexander&#x27;s death in , Perdiccas became the regent of his empire, and after Perdiccas&#x27;s murder in , Antipater became the new regent. According to Diodorus, Antipater recognized Porus&#x27;s authority over the territories along the Indus River. However, Eudemus, who had served as Alexander&#x27;s satrap in the Punjab region, treacherously killed Porus.

==== Mauryan Empire (c. 320–180 BCE) ====
Chandragupta Maurya, with the aid of Kautilya, had established his empire around . The early life of Chandragupta Maurya is not clear. Kautilya enrolled the young Chandragupta in the university at Taxila to educate him in the arts, sciences, logic, mathematics, warfare, and administration. Megasthenes&#x27; account, as it has survived in Greek texts that quote him, states that Alexander the Great and Chandragupta met, which if true would mean his rule started earlier than . As Alexander never crossed the Beas River, so his territory probably lay in the Punjab region. With the help of the small Janapadas of Punjab, he had gone on to conquer much of the North West Indian subcontinent. He then defeated the Nanda rulers in Pataliputra to capture the throne. Chandragupta Maurya fought Alexander&#x27;s successor in the east, Seleucus when the latter invaded. In a peace treaty, Seleucus ceded all territories west of the Indus and offered a marriage, including a portion of Bactria, while Chandragupta granted Seleucus 500 elephants. The chief of the Mauryan military was also always a Yaudheyan warrior according to the Bijaygadh Pillar inscription, which states that the Yaudheyas elected their own chief who also served as the general for the Mauryans. The Mauryan military was also made up vastly of men from the Punjab Janapadas.

Chandragupta&#x27;s rule was very well organised. The Mauryans had an autocratic and centralised administration system, aided by a council of ministers, and also a well-established espionage system. Much of Chandragupta&#x27;s success is attributed to Chanakya, the author of the &quot;Arthashastra.&quot; Much of the Mauryan rule had a strong bureaucracy that had regulated tax collection, trade and commerce, industrial activities, mining, statistics and data, maintenance of public places, and upkeep of temples.

=== Medieval period ===

==== Hindu Shahis (c. 820–1030 CE) ====
In the 9th century, the Hindu Shahi dynasty originating from the region of Oddiyana, replaced the Taank kingdom, ruling Western Punjab along with eastern Afghanistan. The tribe of the Gakhars/Khokhars, formed a large part of the Hindu Shahi army according to the Persian historian Firishta. The most notable rulers of the empire were Lalliya, Bhimadeva and Jayapala who were accredited for military victories.

Lalliya had reclaimed the territory at and around Kabul between 879 and 901 CE after it had been lost under his predecessor to the Saffarid dynasty. He was described as a fearsome Shahi. Two of his ministers reconstructed by Rahman as Toramana and Asata are said to of have taken advantage of Amr al-Layth&#x27;s preoccupation with rebellions in Khorasan, by successfully raiding Ghazna around 900 CE.

After a defeat in Eastern Afghanistan suffered on the Shahi ally Lawik, Bhimadeva mounted a combined attack around 963 CE. Abu Ishaq Ibrahim was expelled from Ghazna and Shahi-Lawik strongholds were restored in Kabul and adjacent areas. This victory appears to have been commemorated in the Hund Slab Inscription (HSI).

==== Turkic rule (c. 1030–1320 CE) ====
The Turkic Ghaznavids in the tenth century overthrew the Hindu Shahis and consequently ruled for 157 years in Western Punjab, gradually declining as a power until the Ghurid conquest of Lahore by Muhammad of Ghor in 1186, deposing the last Ghaznavid ruler Khusrau Malik. Following the death of Muhammad of Ghor in 1206 by Punjabi assassins near the Jhelum river, the Ghurid state fragmented and was replaced in northern India by the Delhi Sultanate.

==== Tughlaq dynasty (c. 1320–1410 CE) ====
The Tughlaq dynasty&#x27;s reign formally started in 1320 in Delhi when Ghazi Malik assumed the throne under the title of Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq after defeating Khusrau Khan at the Battle of Lahrawat.

During Ghazi Malik&#x27;s reign, in 1321 he sent his eldest son Jauna Khan, later known as Muhammad bin Tughlaq, to Deogir to plunder the Hindu kingdoms of Arangal and Tilang (now part of Telangana). His first attempt was a failure. Four months later, Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq sent large army reinforcements for his son asking him to attempt plundering Arangal and Tilang again. This time Jauna Khan succeeded and Arangal fell, it was renamed to Sultanpur, and all plundered wealth, state treasury and captives were transferred from the captured kingdom to the Delhi Sultanate.The Muslim aristocracy in Lukhnauti (Bengal) invited Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq to extend his coup and expand eastwards into Bengal by attacking Shamsuddin Firoz Shah, which he did over 1324–1325 CE, after placing Delhi under control of his son Ulugh Khan, and then leading his army to Lukhnauti. Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq succeeded in this campaign.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1325 CE, Muhammad bin Tughlaq assumed power and his rule saw the empire expand to most of the Indian subcontinent, its peak in terms of geographical reach. He attacked and plundered Malwa, Gujarat, Lakhnauti, Chittagong, Mithila and many other regions in India. His distant campaigns were expensive, although each raid and attack on non-Muslim kingdoms brought new looted wealth and ransom payments from captured people. The extended empire was difficult to retain, and rebellions became commonplace all over the Indian subcontinent. Muhammad bin Tughlaq died in March 1351 while trying to chase and punish people for rebellion and their refusal to pay taxes in Sindh and Gujarat.

After Muhammad bin Tughlaq&#x27;s death, the Tughlaq empire was in a state of disarray with many regions assuming independence; it was at this point that Firuz Shah Tughlaq, Ghazi Malik&#x27;s nephew, took reign. His father&#x27;s name was Rajab (the younger brother of Ghazi Malik) who had the title &quot;Sipahsalar&quot;. His mother Naila was a Punjabi Bhatti princess (daughter of Rana Mal) from Dipalpur and Abohar according to the historian William Crooke. The southern states had drifted away from the Sultanate and there were rebellions in Gujarat and Sindh, while &quot;Bengal asserted its independence.&quot; He led expeditions against Bengal in 1353 and 1358. He captured Cuttack, desecrated the Jagannath Temple, Puri, and forced Raja Gajpati of Jajnagar in Orissa to pay tribute. He also laid siege to the Kangra Fort and forced Nagarkot to pay tribute. During this time, Tatar Khan of Greater Khorasan attacked Punjab, but he was defeated and his face slashed by the sword given by Feroz Shah Tughlaq to Raja Kailas Pal who ruled the Nagarkot region in Punjab.

==== Sayyid dynasty (c. 1410–1450 CE) ====

Khizr Khan established the Sayyid dynasty, the fourth dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate after the fall of the Tughlaqs.

Following Timur&#x27;s 1398 sack of Delhi, he appointed Khizr Khan as deputy of Multan (Punjab). He held Lahore, Dipalpur, Multan and Upper Sindh. Khizr Khan captured Delhi on 28 May 1414 thereby establishing the Sayyid dynasty. Khizr Khan did not take up the title of sultan, but continued the fiction of his allegiance to Timur as &quot;Rayat-i-Ala&quot;(vassal) of the Timurids - initially that of Timur, and later his son Shah Rukh. After the accession of Khizr Khan, the Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Sindh were reunited under the Delhi Sultanate, where he spent his time subduing rebellions. Punjab was the powerbase of Khizr Khan and his successors as the bulk of the Delhi army during their reigns came from Multan and Dipalpur.

Khizr Khan was succeeded by his son Mubarak Shah after his death on 20 May 1421. Mubarak Shah referred to himself as &quot;Muizz-ud-Din Mubarak Shah&quot; on his coins, removing the Timurid name with the name of the Caliph, and declared himself a Shah. He defeated the advancing Hoshang Shah Ghori, ruler of Malwa Sultanate and forced him to pay heavy tribute early in his reign. Mubarak Shah also put down the rebellion of Jasrath Khokhar and managed to fend off multiple invasions by the Timurids of Kabul.

The last ruler of the Sayyids, Ala-ud-Din, voluntarily abdicated the throne of the Delhi Sultanate in favour of Bahlul Khan Lodi on 19 April 1451, and left for Badaun, where he died in 1478.

==== Langah Sultanate (c. 1450–1540 CE) ====
In 1445, Sultan Qutbudin, chief of &quot;Langah&quot; (a Jat Zamindar tribe), established the Langah Sultanate in Multan after the fall of the Sayyid dynasty. Husseyn Langah I (reigned 1456–1502) was the second ruler of Langah Sultanate. He undertook military campaigns in Punjab and captured Chiniot and Shorkot from the Lodis. Shah Husayn successfully repulsed attempted invasion by the Lodis led by Tatar Khan and Barbak Shah, as well as his daughter Zeerak Rumman.

=== Modern period ===
==== Mughal Empire (c. 1526–1761 CE) ====
The Mughals came to power in the early 16th century and gradually expanded to control all of the Punjab from their capital at Lahore. During the Mughal era, Saadullah Khan, born into a family of Punjabi agriculturalists belonging to the Thaheem tribe from Chiniot remained grand vizier (or Prime Minister) of the Mughal Empire in the period 1645–1656. Other prominent Muslims from Punjab who rose to nobility during the Mughal Era include Wazir Khan, Adina Beg Arain, and Shahbaz Khan Kamboh. The Mughal Empire ruled the region until it was severely weakened in the eighteenth century. As Mughal power weakened, Afghan rulers took control of the region. Contested by the Marathas and Afghans, the region was the center of the growing influence of the misls, who expanded and established the Sikh Confederacy as the Mughals and Afghans weakened, ultimately ruling the Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and territories north into the Himalayas.

==== Sikh Empire (c. 1799–1849 CE) ====

In the 19th century, Maharajah Ranjit Singh established the Sikh Empire based in the Punjab. The empire existed from 1799, when Ranjit Singh captured Lahore, to 1849, when it was defeated and conquered in the Second Anglo-Sikh War. It was forged on the foundations of the Khalsa from a collection of autonomous Sikh &quot;misls&quot;. At its peak in the 19th century, the Empire extended from the Khyber Pass in the west to western Tibet in the east, and from Mithankot in the south to Kashmir in the north. It was divided into four provinces: Lahore, in Punjab, which became the Sikh capital; Multan, also in Punjab; Peshawar; and Kashmir from 1799 to 1849. Religiously diverse, with an estimated population of 3.5 million in 1831 (making it the 19th most populous country at the time), it was the last major region of the Indian subcontinent to be annexed by the British Empire.

==== British Punjab (c. 1849–1947 CE) ====
The Sikh Empire ruled the Punjab until the British annexed it in 1849 following the First and Second Anglo-Sikh Wars. Most of the Punjabi homeland formed a province of British India, though a number of small princely states retained local rulers who recognized British authority. The Punjab with its rich farmlands became one of the most important colonial assets. Lahore was a noted center of learning and culture, and Rawalpindi became an important military installation. Most Punjabis supported the British during World War I, providing men and resources to the war effort even though the Punjab remained a source of anti colonial activities. Disturbances in the region increased as the war continued. At the end of the war, high casualty rates, heavy taxation, inflation, and a widespread influenza epidemic disrupted Punjabi society. In 1919, Colonel Reginald Dyer ordered troops under command to fire on a crowd of demonstrators, mostly Sikhs in Amritsar. The Jallianwala massacre fueled the Indian independence movement. Nationalists declared the independence of India from Lahore in 1930 but were quickly suppressed. When the Second World War broke out, nationalism in British India had already divided into religious movements. Many Sikhs and other minorities supported the Hindus, who promised a secular multicultural and multireligious society, and Muslim leaders in Lahore passed a resolution to work for a Muslim Pakistan, making the Punjab region a center of growing conflict between Indian and Pakistani nationalists. At the end of the war, the British granted separate independence to India and Pakistan, setting off massive communal violence as Muslims fled to Pakistan and Hindu and Sikh Punjabis fled east to India.

The British Raj had major political, cultural, philosophical, and literary consequences in the Punjab, including the establishment of a new system of education. During the independence movement, many Punjabis played a significant role, including Madan Lal Dhingra, Sukhdev Thapar, Ajit Singh Sandhu, Bhagat Singh, Udham Singh, Kartar Singh Sarabha, Bhai Parmanand, Choudhry Rahmat Ali, and Lala Lajpat Rai. At the time of partition in 1947, the province was split into East and West Punjab. East Punjab (48%) became part of India, while West Punjab (52%) became part of Pakistan. The Punjab bore the brunt of the civil unrest following partition, with casualties estimated to be in the millions.

Another major consequence of partition was the sudden shift towards religious homogeneity occurred in all districts across Punjab owing to the new international border that cut through the province. This rapid demographic shift was primarily due to wide scale migration but also caused by large-scale religious cleansing riots which were witnessed across the region at the time. According to historical demographer Tim Dyson, in the eastern regions of Punjab that ultimately became Indian Punjab following independence, districts that were 66% Hindu in 1941 became 80% Hindu in 1951; those that were 20% Sikh became 50% Sikh in 1951. Conversely, in the western regions of Punjab that ultimately became Pakistani Punjab, all districts became almost exclusively Muslim by 1951.

== Geography ==
The geographical definition of the term &quot;Punjab&quot; has changed over time. In the 16th century Mughal Empire it referred to a relatively smaller area between the Indus and the Sutlej rivers.

=== Sikh Empire ===

At its height in the first half of the 19th century, the Sikh Empire spanned a total of over .

The Punjab was a region straddling India and the Afghan Durrani Empire. The following modern-day political divisions made up the historical Punjab region during the Sikh Empire:
* Punjab region, to Mithankot in the south
** Punjab, Pakistan, excluding Bahawalpur State
** Punjab, India, south to areas just across the Sutlej river
** Himachal Pradesh, India, south to areas just across the Sutlej river
** Jammu Division, Jammu and Kashmir, India and Pakistan (1808–1846)
* Kashmir region, Pakistan/China
** Kashmir Valley, India (1819–1846)
** Gilgit, Gilgit–Baltistan, Pakistan (1842–1846)
** Ladakh, India (1834–1846)
* Khyber Pass, Pakistan/Afghanistan
** Peshawar, Pakistan (taken in 1818, retaken in 1834)
** Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan (documented from Hazara, taken in 1818, again in 1836 to Bannu)
* Parts of Western Tibet, China (briefly in 1841, to Taklakot)
After Ranjit Singh&#x27;s death in 1839, the empire was severely weakened by internal divisions and political mismanagement. This opportunity was used by the East India Company to launch the First and Second Anglo-Sikh Wars. The country was finally annexed and dissolved at the end of the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849 into separate princely states and the province of Punjab. Eventually, a Lieutenant Governorship was formed in Lahore as a direct representative of the Crown.

=== Punjab (British India) ===

In British India, until the Partition of India in 1947, the Punjab Province was geographically a triangular tract of country of which the Indus River and its tributary the Sutlej formed the two sides up to their confluence, the base of the triangle in the north being the Lower Himalayan Range between those two rivers. Moreover, the province as constituted under British rule also included a large tract outside these boundaries. Along the northern border, Himalayan ranges divided it from Kashmir and Tibet. On the west it was separated from the North-West Frontier Province by the Indus, until it reached the border of Dera Ghazi Khan District, which was divided from Baluchistan by the Sulaiman Range. To the south lay Sindh and Rajputana, while on the east the rivers Jumna and Tons separated it from the United Provinces. In total Punjab had an area of approximately 357 000 km square about the same size as modern day Germany, being one of the largest provinces of the British Raj.
It encompassed the present day Indian states of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, and some parts of Himachal Pradesh which were merged with Punjab by the British for administrative purposes (but excluding the former princely states which were later combined into the Patiala and East Punjab States Union) and the Pakistani regions of the Punjab, Islamabad Capital Territory and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

In 1901 the frontier districts beyond the Indus were separated from Punjab and made into a new province: the North-West Frontier Province. Subsequently, Punjab was divided into four natural geographical divisions by colonial officials on the decadal census data:

# Indo-Gangetic Plain West geographical division (including Hisar district, Loharu State, Rohtak district, Dujana State, Gurgaon district, Pataudi State, Delhi, Karnal district, Jalandhar district, Kapurthala State, Ludhiana district, Malerkotla State, Firozpur district, Faridkot State, Patiala State, Jind State, Nabha State, Lahore District, Amritsar district, Gujranwala District, and Sheikhupura district);
# Himalayan geographical division (including Nahan State, Simla District, Simla Hill States, Kangra district, Mandi State, Suket State, and Chamba State);
# Sub-Himalayan geographical division (including Ambala district, Kalsia State, Hoshiarpur district, Gurdaspur district, Sialkot District, Gujrat District, Jhelum District, Rawalpindi District, and Attock District;
# North-West Dry Area geographical division (including Montgomery District, Shahpur District, Mianwali District, Lyallpur District, Jhang District, Multan District, Bahawalpur State, Muzaffargarh District, and Dera Ghazi Khan District).

=== Partition of British Punjab ===
The struggle for Indian independence witnessed competing and conflicting interests in the Punjab. The landed elites of the Muslim, Hindu and Sikh communities had loyally collaborated with the British since annexation, supported the Unionist Party and were hostile to the Congress party–led independence movement. Amongst the peasantry and urban middle classes, the Hindus were the most active National Congress supporters, the Sikhs flocked to the Akali movement whilst the Muslims eventually supported the Muslim League.

Since the partition of the sub-continent had been decided, special meetings of the Western and Eastern Section of the Legislative Assembly were held on 23 June 1947 to decide whether or not the Province of the Punjab be partitioned. After voting on both sides, partition was decided and the existing Punjab Legislative Assembly was also divided into West Punjab Legislative Assembly and the East Punjab Legislative Assembly. This last Assembly before independence, held its last sitting on 4 July 1947.

=== Major cities ===
Historically, Lahore has been the capital of the Punjab region and continues to be the most populous city in the region, with a population of 11 million for the city proper. Faisalabad is the 2nd most populous city and largest industrial hub in this region. Other major cities are Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Multan, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jalandhar, and Chandigarh are the other cities in Punjab with a city-proper population of over a million.

== Climate ==
The climate has significant impact on the economy of Punjab, particularly for agriculture in the region. Climate is not uniform over the whole region, as the areas adjacent to the Himalayas generally receive heavier rainfall than those at a distance.

There are three main seasons and two transitional periods. During the hot season, from mid-April to the end of June, the temperature may reach . The monsoon season, from July to September, is a period of heavy rainfall, providing water for crops in addition to the supply from canals and irrigation systems. The transitional period after the monsoon season is cool and mild, leading to the winter season, when the temperature in January falls to at night and by day. During the transitional period from winter to the hot season, sudden hailstorms and heavy showers may occur, causing damage to crops.

==Demographics==
===Languages===
The major language is Punjabi, which is written in India with the Gurmukhi script, and in Pakistan using the Shahmukhi script. The Punjabi language has official status and is widely used in education and administration in Indian Punjab, whereas in Pakistani Punjab these roles are instead fulfilled by the Urdu language.

Several languages closely related to Punjabi are spoken in the various parts of the region. Dogri, Kangri, and other western Pahari dialects are spoken in the north-central and northeastern parts of the region, while Bagri is spoken in south-central and southeastern sections. Meanwhile, Saraiki is generally spoken across a wide belt covering the southwest, while in the northwest there are large pockets containing speakers of Hindko and Pothwari.

=== Religions ===
==== Background ====
Hinduism is the oldest of the religions practised by Punjabi people, however, the term &quot;Hindu&quot; was also applied over a vast territory with much regional diversity. The historical Vedic religion constituted the religious ideas and practices in the Punjab during the Vedic period (), centered primarily in the worship of Indra. The bulk of the Rigveda was composed in the Punjab region between circa 1500 and 1200 BCE, while later Vedic scriptures were composed more eastwards, between the Yamuna and Ganges rivers. An ancient Indian law book called the Manusmriti, developed by Brahmin Hindu priests, shaped Punjabi religious life from 200 BCE onward.

Later, the spread of Buddhisim and Jainism in the Indian subcontinent saw the growth of Buddhism and Jainism in the Punjab. Islam was introduced via southern Punjab in the 8th century, becoming the majority by the 16th century, via local conversion. There was a small Jain community left in Punjab by the 16th century, while the Buddhist community had largely disappeared by the turn of the 10th century. The region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of the Punjab region.

The rise of Sikhism in the 1700s saw some Punjabis, both Hindu and Muslim, accepting the new Sikh faith. A number of Punjabis during the colonial period of India became Christians, with all of these religions characterizing the religious diversity now found in the Punjab region.

==== Colonial era ====

A number of Punjabis during the colonial period of India became Christians, with all of these religions characterizing the religious diversity now found in the Punjab region. Additionally during the colonial era, the practice of religious syncretism among Punjabi Muslims and Punjabi Hindus was noted and documented by officials in census reports:




The &quot;Indo−Gangetic Plain West geographical division&quot; included Hisar district, Loharu State, Rohtak district, Dujana State, Gurgaon district, Pataudi State, Delhi, Karnal district, Jalandhar district, Kapurthala State, Ludhiana district, Malerkotla State, Firozpur district, Faridkot State, Patiala State, Jind State, Nabha State, Lahore District, Amritsar district, Gujranwala District, and Sheikhupura District.

The &quot;Himalayan geographical division&quot; included Sirmoor State, Simla District, Simla Hill States, Bilaspur State, Kangra district, Mandi State, Suket State, and Chamba State.

The &quot;Sub−Himalayan geographical division&quot; included Ambala district, Kalsia State, Hoshiarpur district, Gurdaspur district, Sialkot District, Gujrat District, Jhelum District, Rawalpindi District, and Attock District.

The &quot;North−West Dry Area geographical division&quot; included Montgomery District, Shahpur District, Mianwali District, Lyallpur District, Jhang District, Multan District, Bahawalpur State, Muzaffargarh District, Dera Ghazi Khan District, and the Biloch Trans–Frontier Tract.

==== Post-partition ====
In the present-day, the vast majority of Pakistani Punjabis are Sunni Muslim by faith, but also include significant minority faiths, such as Shia Muslims, Ahmadi Muslims, Hindus, Sikhs and Christians.

Sikhism, founded by Guru Nanak is the main religion practised in the post-1966 Indian Punjab state. About 57.7% of the population of Punjab state is Sikh, 38.5% is Hindu, with the remaining population including Muslims, Christians, and Jains. Punjab state contains the holy Sikh cities of Amritsar, Anandpur Sahib, Tarn Taran Sahib, Fatehgarh Sahib and Chamkaur Sahib.

The Punjab was home to several Sufi saints, and Sufism is well established in the region. Also, Kirpal Singh revered the Sikh Gurus as saints.

=== Tribes ===




The Punjab region is diverse. Historic census reports taken in the colonial era details the main castes are represented, alongside numerous subcastes and tribes (also known as &quot;Jāti&quot; or &quot;Barādarī&quot;), formed parts of the various ethnic groups in the region, contemporarily known as Punjabis, Saraikis, Haryanvis, Hindkowans, Dogras, Paharis, and more.
==Economy==
The historical region of Punjab produces a relatively high proportion of the food output from India and Pakistan. The region has been used for extensive wheat farming. In addition, rice, cotton, sugarcane, fruit, and vegetables are also grown.

The agricultural output of the Punjab region in Pakistan contributes significantly to Pakistan&#x27;s GDP. Both Indian and Pakistani Punjab is considered to have the best infrastructure of their respective countries. The Indian state of Punjab is currently the 16th richest state or the eighth richest large state of India. Pakistani Punjab produces 68% of Pakistan&#x27;s foodgrain production. Its share of Pakistan&#x27;s GDP has historically ranged from 51.8% to 54.7%.

Called &quot;The Granary of India&quot; or &quot;The Bread Basket of India&quot;, Indian Punjab produces 1% of the world&#x27;s rice, 2% of its wheat, and 2% of its cotton. In 2001, it was recorded that farmers made up 39% of Indian Punjab&#x27;s workforce. In the Punjab region of Pakistan, 42.3% of the labour force is engaged in the agriculture sector.

Alternatively, Punjab is also adding to the economy with the increase in employment of Punjab youth in the private sector. Government schemes such as &#x27;Ghar Ghar Rozgar and Karobar Mission&#x27; have brought enhanced employability in the private sector. , more than 32,000 youths have been placed in different jobs and 12,000 have been skill-trained.

<text>A ring system is a disc or torus orbiting an astronomical object that is composed of solid material such as dust, meteoroids, planetoids, moonlets, or stellar objects.

Ring systems are best known as planetary rings, common components of satellite systems around giant planets such as the rings of Saturn, or circumplanetary disks. But they can also be galactic rings and circumstellar discs, belts of planetoids, such as the asteroid belt or Kuiper belt, or rings of interplanetary dust, such as around the Sun at distances of Mercury, Venus, and Earth, in mean motion resonance with these planets. Evidence suggests that ring systems may also be found around other types of astronomical objects, including moons and brown dwarfs.

In the Solar System, all four giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) have ring systems. Ring systems around minor planets have also been discovered via occultations. Some studies even theorize that the Earth may have had a ring system during the mid-late Ordovician period.

== Formation ==
There are three ways that thicker planetary rings have been proposed to have formed: from material originating from the protoplanetary disk that was within the Roche limit of the planet and thus could not coalesce to form moons, from the debris of a moon that was disrupted by a large impact, or from the debris of a moon that was disrupted by tidal stresses when it passed within the planet&#x27;s Roche limit. Most rings were thought to be unstable and to dissipate over the course of tens or hundreds of millions of years, but it now appears that Saturn&#x27;s rings might be quite old, dating to the early days of the Solar System.

Fainter planetary rings can form as a result of meteoroid impacts with moons orbiting around the planet or, in the case of Saturn&#x27;s E-ring, the ejecta of cryovolcanic material.

Ring systems may form around centaurs when they are tidally disrupted in a close encounter (within 0.4 to 0.8 times the Roche limit) with a giant planet. For a differentiated body approaching a giant planet at an initial relative velocity of 3−6 km/s with an initial rotational period of 8 hours, a ring mass of 0.1%−10% of the centaur&#x27;s mass is predicted. Ring formation from an undifferentiated body is less likely. The rings would be composed mostly or entirely of material from the parent body&#x27;s icy mantle. After forming, the ring would spread laterally, leading to satellite formation from whatever portion of it spreads beyond the centaur&#x27;s Roche Limit. Satellites could also form directly from the disrupted icy mantle. This formation mechanism predicts that roughly 10% of centaurs will have experienced potentially ring-forming encounters with giant planets.

== Ring systems of planets ==
The composition of planetary ring particles varies, ranging from silicates to icy dust. Larger rocks and boulders may also be present, and in 2007 tidal effects from eight moonlets only a few hundred meters across were detected within Saturn&#x27;s rings. The maximum size of a ring particle is determined by the specific strength of the material it is made of, its density, and the tidal force at its altitude. The tidal force is proportional to the average density inside the radius of the ring, or to the mass of the planet divided by the radius of the ring cubed. It is also inversely proportional to the square of the orbital period of the ring.

Some planetary rings are influenced by &quot;shepherd moons&quot;, small moons that orbit near the inner or outer edges of a ringlet or within gaps in the rings. The gravity of shepherd moons serves to maintain a sharply defined edge to the ring; material that drifts closer to the shepherd moon&#x27;s orbit is either deflected back into the body of the ring, ejected from the system, or accreted onto the moon itself.

It is also predicted that Phobos, a moon of Mars, will break up and form into a planetary ring in about 50 million years. Its low orbit, with an orbital period that is shorter than a Martian day, is decaying due to tidal deceleration.

=== Jupiter ===

Jupiter&#x27;s ring system was the third to be discovered, when it was first observed by the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; probe in 1979, and was observed more thoroughly by the &quot;Galileo&quot; orbiter in the 1990s. Its four main parts are a faint thick torus known as the &quot;halo&quot;; a thin, relatively bright main ring; and two wide, faint &quot;gossamer rings&quot;. The system consists mostly of dust.

===Saturn===

Saturn&#x27;s rings are the most extensive ring system of any planet in the Solar System, and thus have been known to exist for quite some time. Galileo Galilei first observed them in 1610, but they were not accurately described as a disk around Saturn until Christiaan Huygens did so in 1655. The rings are not a series of tiny ringlets as many think, but are more of a disk with varying density. They consist mostly of water ice and trace amounts of rock, and the particles range in size from micrometers to meters.

===Uranus===

Uranus&#x27;s ring system lies between the level of complexity of Saturn&#x27;s vast system and the simpler systems around Jupiter and Neptune. They were discovered in 1977 by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Jessica Mink. In the time between then and 2005, observations by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; and the Hubble Space Telescope led to a total of 13 distinct rings being identified, most of which are opaque and only a few kilometers wide. They are dark and likely consist of water ice and some radiation-processed organics. The relative lack of dust is due to aerodynamic drag from the extended exosphere-corona of Uranus.

===Neptune===

The system around Neptune consists of five principal rings that, at their densest, are comparable to the low-density regions of Saturn&#x27;s rings. However, they are faint and dusty, much more similar in structure to those of Jupiter. The very dark material that makes up the rings is likely organics processed by radiation, like in the rings of Uranus. 20 to 70 percent of the rings are dust, a relatively high proportion. Hints of the rings were seen for decades prior to their conclusive discovery by &quot;Voyager 2&quot; in 1989.

=== Prehistoric ring systems ===

==== Earth ====
A 2024 study suggests that Earth may have had a ring system for a period of 40 million years, starting from the middle of the Ordovician period (around 466 million years ago). This ring system may have originated from a large asteroid that passed by Earth at this time and had a significant amount of debris stripped by Earth&#x27;s gravitational pull, forming a ring system. Evidence for this ring comes from impact craters from the Ordovician meteor event appearing to cluster in a distinctive band around the Earth&#x27;s equator at that time. The presence of this ring may have led to significant shielding of Earth from sun&#x27;s rays and a severe cooling event, thus causing the Hirnantian glaciation, the coldest known period of the last 450 million years.

==Rings systems of minor planets and moons==
Reports in March 2008 suggested that Saturn&#x27;s moon Rhea may have its own tenuous ring system, which would make it the only moon known to have a ring system. A later study published in 2010 revealed that imaging of Rhea by the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft was inconsistent with the predicted properties of the rings, suggesting that some other mechanism is responsible for the magnetic effects that had led to the ring hypothesis.

Prior to the arrival of &quot;New Horizons&quot;, some astronomers hypothesized that Pluto and Charon might have a circumbinary ring system created from dust ejected off of Pluto&#x27;s small outer moons in impacts. A dust ring would have posed a considerable risk to the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft. However, this possibility was ruled out when &quot;New Horizons&quot; failed to detect any dust rings around Pluto.

===Chariklo===

10199 Chariklo, a centaur, was the first minor planet discovered to have rings. It has two rings, perhaps due to a collision that caused a chain of debris to orbit it. The rings were discovered when astronomers observed Chariklo passing in front of the star UCAC4 248-108672 on June 3, 2013 from seven locations in South America. While watching, they saw two dips in the star&#x27;s apparent brightness just before and after the occultation. Because this event was observed at multiple locations, the conclusion that the dip in brightness was in fact due to rings is unanimously the leading hypothesis. The observations revealed what is likely a -wide ring system that is about 1,000 times closer than the Moon is to Earth. In addition, astronomers suspect there could be a moon orbiting amidst the ring debris. If these rings are the leftovers of a collision as astronomers suspect, this would give fodder to the idea that moons (such as the Moon) form through collisions of smaller bits of material. Chariklo&#x27;s rings have not been officially named, but the discoverers have nicknamed them Oiapoque and Chuí, after two rivers near the northern and southern ends of Brazil.

===Chiron===

A second centaur, 2060 Chiron, has a constantly evolving disk of rings. Based on stellar-occultation data that were initially interpreted as resulting from jets associated with Chiron&#x27;s comet-like activity, the rings are proposed to be in radius, though their evolution does change the radius somewhat. Their changing appearance at different viewing angles can explain the long-term variation in Chiron&#x27;s brightness over time. Chiron&#x27;s rings are suspected to be maintained by orbiting material ejected during seasonal outbursts, as a third partial ring detected in 2018 had become a full ring by 2022, with an outburst in between in 2021.

===Haumea===
A ring around Haumea, a dwarf planet and resonant Kuiper belt member, was revealed by a stellar occultation observed on 21 January 2017. This makes it the first trans-Neptunian object found to have a ring system. The ring has a radius of about , a width of ≈ and an opacity of 0.5. The ring plane coincides with Haumea&#x27;s equator and the orbit of its larger, outer moon Hi’iaka (which has a semimajor axis of ≈). The ring is close to the 3:1 resonance with Haumea&#x27;s rotation, which is located at a radius of . It is well within Haumea&#x27;s Roche limit, which would lie at a radius of about if Haumea were spherical (being nonspherical pushes the limit out farther).

=== Quaoar ===
In 2023, astronomers announced the discovery of a widely separated ring around the dwarf planet and Kuiper belt object Quaoar. Further analysis of the occultation data uncovered a second inner, fainter ring.

Both rings display unusual properties. The outer ring orbits at a distance of , approximately 7.5 times the radius of Quaoar and more than double the distance of its Roche limit. The inner ring orbits at a distance of , approximately 4.6 times the radius of Quaoar and also beyond its Roche limit. The outer ring appears to be inhomogeneous, containing a thin, dense section as well as a broader, more diffuse section.

== Rings around exoplanets ==

Because all giant planets of the Solar System have rings, the existence of exoplanets with rings is plausible. Although particles of ice, the material that is predominant in the rings of Saturn, can only exist around planets beyond the frost line, within this line rings consisting of rocky material can be stable in the long term. Such ring systems can be detected for planets observed by the transit method by additional reduction of the light of the central star if their opacity is sufficient. As of 2024, two candidate extrasolar ring systems have been found by this method, around HIP 41378 f and K2-33b.

Fomalhaut b was found to be large and unclearly defined when detected in 2008. This was hypothesized to either be due to a cloud of dust attracted from the dust disc of the star, or a possible ring system, though in 2020 Fomalhaut b itself was determined to very likely be an expanding debris cloud from a collision of asteroids rather than a planet. Similarly, Proxima Centauri c has been observed to be far brighter than expected for its low mass of 7 Earth masses, which may be attributed to a ring system of about 5 .

A 56-day-long sequence of dimming events in the star V1400 Centauri observed in 2007 was interpreted as a substellar object with a circumstellar disk or massive rings transiting the star. This substellar object, dubbed &quot;J1407b&quot;, is most likely a free-floating brown dwarf or rogue planet several times the mass of Jupiter. The circumstellar disk or ring system of J1407b is about in radius. J1407b&#x27;s transit of V1400 Centauri revealed gaps and density variations within its disk or ring system, which has been interpreted as hints of exomoons or exoplanets forming around J1407b.

<doc id="24722" wikidata="Q285614" url="?curid=24722" title="P-code machine">
<text>In computer programming, a P-code machine (portable code machine) is a virtual machine designed to execute &quot;P-code,&quot; the assembly language or machine code of a hypothetical central processing unit (CPU). The term &quot;P-code machine&quot; is applied generically to all such machines (such as the Java virtual machine (JVM) and MATLAB pre-compiled code), as well as specific implementations using those machines. One of the most notable uses of P-Code machines is the P-Machine of the Pascal-P system. The developers of the UCSD Pascal implementation within this system construed the &quot;P&quot; in &quot;P-code&quot; to mean &quot;pseudo&quot; more often than &quot;portable;&quot; they adopted a unique label for &quot;pseudo-code&quot; meaning instructions for a pseudo-machine.

Although the concept was first implemented circa 1966 as O-code for the Basic Combined Programming Language (BCPL) and P code for the language Euler, the &quot;term&quot; P-code first appeared in the early 1970s. Two early compilers generating P-code were the Pascal-P compiler in 1973, by Kesav V. Nori, Urs Ammann, Kathleen Jensen, Hans-Heinrich Nägeli, and Christian Jacobi, and the Pascal-S compiler in 1975, by Niklaus Wirth.

Programs that have been translated to P-code can either be interpreted by a software program that emulates the behaviour of the hypothetical CPU, or translated into the machine code of the CPU on which the program is to run and then executed. If there is sufficient commercial interest, a hardware implementation of the CPU specification may be built (e.g., the Pascal MicroEngine or a version of a Java processor).

==P-code versus machine code==

While a typical compiler model is aimed at translating a program code into machine code, the idea of a P-code machine follows a two-stage approach involving translation into P-code and execution by interpreting or just-in-time compilation (JIT) through the P-code machine.

This separation makes it possible to detach the development of a P-code interpreter from the underlying machine code compiler, which has to consider machine-dependent behaviour in generating its bytecode. This way a P-code interpreter can also be implemented quicker, and the ability to interpret the code at runtime allows for additional run-time checks which might not be similarly available in native code. Further, as P-code is based on an ideal virtual machine, a P-code program can often be smaller than the same program translated to machine code. Conversely, the two-step interpretation of a P-code-based program leads to a slower execution speed, though this can sometimes be addressed with just-in-time compilation, and its simpler structure is easier to reverse-engineer than native code.

==Implementations of P-code==
In the early 1980s, at least two operating systems achieved machine independence through extensive use of P-code . The Business Operating System (BOS) was a cross-platform operating system designed to run P-code programs exclusively. The UCSD p-System, developed at The University of California, San Diego, was a self-compiling and self-hosting operating system based on P-code optimized for generation by the Pascal language.

In the 1990s, translation into p-code became a popular strategy for implementations of languages such as Python, Microsoft P-Code in Visual Basic and Java bytecode in Java.

The language Go uses a generic, portable assembly as a form of p-code, implemented by Ken Thompson as an extension of the work on Plan 9 from Bell Labs. Unlike Common Language Runtime (CLR) bytecode or JVM bytecode, there is no stable specification and the Go build tools do not emit a bytecode format to be used at a later time. The Go assembler uses the generic assembly language as an intermediate representation and the Go executables are machine-specific statically linked binaries.

==UCSD P-Machine==

===Architecture===
Like many other P-code machines, the UCSD P-Machine is a stack machine, which means that most instructions take their operands from a stack, and place results back on the stack. Thus, the codice_1 instruction replaces the two topmost elements of the stack with their sum. A few instructions take an immediate argument. Like Pascal, the P-code is strongly typed, supporting Boolean (b), character (c), integer (i), real (r), set (s), and pointer (a) data types natively.

Some simple instructions:

 Insn. Stack Stack Description
 before after
 adi i1 i2 i1+i2 add two integers
 adr r1 r2 r1+r2 add two reals
 inn i1 s1 b1 set membership; b1 = whether i1 is a member of s1
 ldi i1 i1 i1 load integer constant
 mov a1 a2 a2 move
 not b1 b1 -b1 Boolean negation

===Environment===
Similar to a real target CPU, the P-System has only one stack shared by procedure stack frames (providing return address, etc.) and the arguments to local instructions. Three of the machine&#x27;s registers point into the stack (which grows upwards):
* SP points to the top of the stack (the stack pointer).
* MP marks the beginning of the active stack frame (the mark pointer).
* EP points to the highest stack location used in the current procedure (the extreme pointer).

Also present is a constant area, and, below that, the heap growing down towards the stack. The NP (the new pointer) register points to the top (lowest used address) of the heap. When EP gets greater than NP, the machine&#x27;s memory is exhausted.

The fifth register, PC, points at the current instruction in the code area.

===Calling conventions===
Stack frames look like this:

 EP -&gt;
 local stack
 SP -&gt; ...
 locals
 parameters
 return address (previous PC)
 previous EP
 dynamic link (previous MP)
 static link (MP of surrounding procedure)
 MP -&gt; function return value

The procedure calling sequence works as follows: The call is introduced with

 mst n

where codice_2 specifies the difference in nesting levels (remember that Pascal supports nested procedures). This instruction will &quot;mark&quot; the stack, i.e. reserve the first five cells of the above stack frame, and initialize previous EP, dynamic, and static link. The caller then computes and pushes any parameters for the procedure, and then issues

 cup n, p

to call a user procedure (codice_2 being the number of parameters, codice_4 the procedure&#x27;s address). This will save the PC in the return address cell, and set the procedure&#x27;s address as the new PC.

User procedures begin with the two instructions

 ent 1, i
 ent 2, j

The first sets SP to MP + codice_5, the second sets EP to SP + codice_6. So codice_5 essentially specifies the space reserved for locals (plus the number of parameters plus 5), and codice_6 gives the number of entries needed locally for the stack. Memory exhaustion is checked at this point.

Returning to the caller is accomplished via

 retC

with codice_9 giving the return type (i, r, c, b, a as above, and p for no return value). The return value has to be stored in the appropriate cell previously. On all types except p, returning will leave this value on the stack.

Instead of calling a user procedure (cup), standard procedure codice_10 can be called with

 csp q

These standard procedures are Pascal procedures like codice_11 (codice_12), codice_13 (codice_14), etc. Peculiarly codice_15 is a p-Code instruction instead.

==Example machine==
Niklaus Wirth specified a simple p-code machine in the 1976 book &quot;Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs&quot;. The machine had 3 registers - a program counter &quot;p&quot;, a base register &quot;b&quot; and a top-of-stack register &quot;t&quot;. There were 8 instructions:
# codice_16 : load constant 
# codice_17 : execute operation (13 operations: RETURN, 5 mathematical functions, and 7 comparison functions)
# codice_18 : load variable , 
# codice_19 : store variable , 
# codice_20 : call procedure at level 
# codice_21 : increment t-register by 
# codice_22 : jump to 
# codice_23 : jump conditional to 

This is the code for the machine, written in Pascal:
const
 amax=2047; {maximum address}
 levmax=3; {maximum depth of block nesting}
 cxmax=200; {size of code array}

type
 fct=(lit,opr,lod,sto,cal,int,jmp,jpc);
 instruction=packed record
 f:fct;
 l:0..levmax;
 a:0..amax;
 end;

var
 code: array [0..cxmax] of instruction;

procedure interpret;

 const stacksize = 500;

 var
 p, b, t: integer; {program-, base-, topstack-registers}
 i: instruction; {instruction register}
 s: array [1..stacksize] of integer; {datastore}

 function base(l: integer): integer;
 var b1: integer;
 begin
 b1 := b; {find base l levels down}
 while l &gt; 0 do begin
 b1 := s[b1];
 l := l - 1
 end;
 base := b1
 end {base};

begin
 writeln(&#x27; start pl/0&#x27;);
 t := 0; b := 1; p := 0;
 s[1] := 0; s[2] := 0; s[3] := 0;
 repeat
 i := code[p]; p := p + 1;
 with i do
 case f of
 lit: begin t := t + 1; s[t] := a end;
 opr:
 case a of {operator}
 0:
 begin {return}
 t := b - 1; p := s[t + 3]; b := s[t + 2];
 end;
 1: s[t] := -s[t];
 2: begin t := t - 1; s[t] := s[t] + s[t + 1] end;
 3: begin t := t - 1; s[t] := s[t] - s[t + 1] end;
 4: begin t := t - 1; s[t] := s[t] * s[t + 1] end;
 5: begin t := t - 1; s[t] := s[t] div s[t + 1] end;
 6: s[t] := ord(odd(s[t]));
 8: begin t := t - 1; s[t] := ord(s[t] = s[t + 1]) end;
 9: begin t := t - 1; s[t] := ord(s[t] &lt;&gt; s[t + 1]) end;
 10: begin t := t - 1; s[t] := ord(s[t] &lt; s[t + 1]) end;
 11: begin t := t - 1; s[t] := ord(s[t] &gt;= s[t + 1]) end;
 12: begin t := t - 1; s[t] := ord(s[t] &gt; s[t + 1]) end;
 13: begin t := t - 1; s[t] := ord(s[t] &lt;= s[t + 1]) end;
 end;
 lod: begin t := t + 1; s[t] := s[base(l) + a] end;
 sto: begin s[base(l)+a] := s[t]; writeln(s[t]); t := t - 1 end;
 cal:
 begin {generate new block mark}
 s[t + 1] := base(l); s[t + 2] := b; s[t + 3] := p;
 b := t + 1; p := a
 end;
 int: t := t + a;
 jmp: p := a;
 jpc: begin if s[t] = 0 then p := a; t := t - 1 end
 end {with, case}
 until p = 0;
 writeln(&#x27; end pl/0&#x27;);
end {interpret};
This machine was used to run Wirth&#x27;s PL/0, a Pascal subset compiler used to teach compiler development.

==Microsoft P-code==
P-code is a name for several of Microsoft&#x27;s proprietary intermediate languages. They provided an alternate binary format to machine code. At various times, Microsoft has said P-code is an abbreviation for either &quot;packed code&quot; or &quot;pseudo code&quot;.

Microsoft P-code was used in Visual C++ and Visual Basic. Like other P-code implementations, Microsoft P-code enabled a more compact executable at the expense of slower execution.

<doc id="24723" wikidata="Q421704" url="?curid=24723" title="Proton-pump inhibitor">
<text>Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are a class of medications that cause a profound and prolonged reduction of stomach acid production. They do so by irreversibly inhibiting the stomach&#x27;s H+/K+ ATPase proton pump. The body eventually synthesizes new proton pumps to replace the irreversibly inhibited ones, a process driven by normal cellular turnover, which gradually restores acid production.

Proton-pump inhibitors have largely superseded the H2-receptor antagonists, a group of medications with similar effects but a different mode of action, and heavy use of antacids. A potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB) revaprazan was marketed in Korea as an alternative to a PPI. A newer PCAB vonoprazan with a faster and longer lasting action than revaprazan, and PPIs has been marketed in Japan (2013), Russia (2021), and the US (2023).
PPIs are among the most widely sold medications in the world. The class of proton-pump inhibitor medications is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Omeprazole is the specific listed example.

== Medical uses ==
These medications are used in the treatment of many conditions, such as:
* Dyspepsia
* Peptic ulcer disease including after endoscopic treatment for bleeding
* As part of &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; eradication therapy
* Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD or GORD) including symptomatic endoscopy-negative reflux disease and associated laryngopharyngeal reflux causing laryngitis and chronic cough
* Barrett&#x27;s esophagus
* Eosinophilic esophagitis
* Stress gastritis and ulcer prevention in critical care
* Gastrinomas 
* Zollinger–Ellison syndrome (often 2–3× the regular dose is required)

Specialty professional organizations recommend that people take the lowest effective PPI dose to achieve the desired therapeutic result when used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease long-term. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has advised that over-the-counter PPIs, such as Prilosec OTC, should be used no more than three 14-day treatment courses over one year.

Despite their extensive use, the quality of the evidence supporting their use in some of these conditions is variable. The effectiveness of PPIs has not been demonstrated for every case. For example, although they reduce the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma in Barrett&#x27;s oesophagus, they do not change the length affected. In addition, research in the UK has suggested that PPIs are not effective at treating persistent throat symptoms.

===Indications for stopping PPIs===
PPIs are often used longer than necessary. In about half of people who are hospitalized or seen at a primary care clinic there is no documented reason for their long-term use of PPIs. Some researchers believe that, given the little evidence of long-term effectiveness, the cost of the medication and the potential for harm means that clinicians should consider stopping PPIs in many people.

== Adverse effects ==
In general, proton pump inhibitors are well tolerated, and the incidence of short-term adverse effects is relatively low. The range and occurrence of adverse effects are similar for all of the PPIs, though they have been reported more frequently with omeprazole. This may be due to its longer availability and, hence, clinical experience.

Common adverse effects include headache, nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and dizziness. Infrequent adverse effects include rash, itch, flatulence, constipation, anxiety, and depression. Also infrequently, PPI use may be associated with occurrence of myopathies, including the serious reaction rhabdomyolysis.

Long-term use of PPIs requires assessment of the balance of the benefits and risks of the therapy. As of March 2017, various adverse outcomes have been associated with long-term PPI use in several primary reports, but reviews assess the overall quality of evidence in these studies as &quot;low&quot; or &quot;very low&quot;. They describe inadequate evidence to establish causal relationships between PPI therapy and many of the proposed associations, due to study design and small estimates of effect size. 

As of March 2017, benefits outweighed risks when PPIs are used appropriately, but when used inappropriately, modest risks become important. They recommend that PPIs should be used at the lowest effective dose in people with a proven indication, but discourage dose escalation and continued chronic therapy in people unresponsive to initial empiric therapy.

With regard to iron and vitamin B12, the data is weak and several confounding factors have been identified. Low levels of magnesium can be found in people on PPI therapy and these can be reversed when they are switched to H2-receptor antagonist medications.

===Bone ===
High dose or long-term use of PPIs carries an increased risk of bone fractures which was not found with short-term, low dose use; the FDA included a warning regarding this on PPI drug labels in 2010.

In infants, acid suppression therapy is frequently prescribed to treat symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux in otherwise healthy infants (that is: without gastroesophageal reflux disease). A study from 2019 showed that PPI use alone and together with histamine H2-receptor antagonists was associated with an increased bone fracture hazard, which was amplified by days of use and earlier initiation of therapy. The reason is not clear; increased bone break down by osteoclasts has been suggested.

A recent 2024 study published in the &quot;Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism&quot; found that chronic use of PPIs in men is linked to lower trabecular bone quality. Specifically, PPI use was associated with reduced lumbar spine trabecular bone score (TBS), as well as lower bone mineral density (BMD) T-scores in the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck. There are associations with an increased risk of stroke, but this appears to be more likely to occur in people who already have an elevated risk.

One suggested mechanism for cardiovascular effects is because PPIs bind and inhibit dimethylargininase, the enzyme that degrades asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), resulting in higher ADMA levels and a decrease in bioavailable nitric oxide.

=== Cancer ===

A 2022 umbrella review of 21 meta-analyses shows an association between proton-pump inhibitor use and an increased risk of four types of cancer.

=== Other ===
Associations have been shown between PPI use and an increased risk of pneumonia, particularly in the 30 days after starting therapy, where it was found to be 50% higher in community use. Other very weak associations of PPI use have been found, such as with chronic kidney disease, dementia and Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

As of 2016, results were derived from observational studies, it remained uncertain whether such associations were causal relationships.

== Mechanism of action ==

Proton pump inhibitors act by irreversibly blocking the hydrogen/potassium adenosine triphosphatase enzyme system (the H+/K+ ATPase, or, more commonly, the gastric proton pump) of the gastric parietal cells. The proton pump is the terminal stage in gastric acid secretion, being directly responsible for secreting H+ ions into the gastric lumen, making it an ideal target for inhibiting acid secretion. Because the H,K-ATPase is the final step of acid secretion, an inhibitor of this enzyme is more effective than receptor antagonists in suppressing gastric acid secretion. All of these drugs inhibit the gastric H,K-ATPase by covalent binding, so the duration of their effect is longer than expected from their levels in the blood.

Targeting the terminal step in acid production, as well as the irreversible nature of the inhibition, results in a class of medications that are significantly more effective than H2 antagonists and reduce gastric acid secretion by up to 99%.

Decreasing the acid in the stomach can aid the healing of duodenal ulcers and reduce the pain from indigestion and heartburn. However, stomach acids are needed to digest proteins, vitamin B12, calcium, and other nutrients, and too little stomach acid causes the condition hypochlorhydria.

The PPIs are given in an inactive form, which is neutrally charged (lipophilic) and readily crosses cell membranes into intracellular compartments (like the parietal cell canaliculus) with acidic environments. In an acid environment, the inactive drug is protonated and rearranges into its active form. As described above, the active form will covalently and irreversibly bind to the gastric proton pump, deactivating it.

In &quot;H. pylori&quot; eradication, PPIs help by increasing the stomach pH, causing the bacterium to shift out of its coccoid form which is resistant to both acids and antibiotics. PPIs also show some weaker additional effects in eradication.

== Pharmacokinetics ==
The rate of omeprazole absorption is decreased by concomitant food intake. In addition, the absorption of lansoprazole and esomeprazole is decreased and delayed by food. It has been reported, however, that these pharmacokinetic effects have no significant impact on efficacy.

In healthy humans, the half-life of PPIs is about 1 hour (9 hours for tenatoprazole), but the duration of acid inhibition is 48 hours because of irreversible binding to the H,K-ATPase. All the PPIs except tenatoprazole are rapidly metabolized in the liver by CYP enzymes (mostly by CYP2C19 and 3A4). Dissociation of the inhibitory complex is probably due to the effect of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione which leads to the release of omeprazole sulfide and reactivation of the enzyme.

== Examples ==
Medically used proton pump inhibitors:
* Dexlansoprazole
* Esomeprazole (OTC and Rx-only in the US and Australia)
* Ilaprazole (not FDA-approved )
* Lansoprazole (OTC and Rx-only in the US)
* Omeprazole (over-the-counter drug)
* Pantoprazole
* Rabeprazole

There is no clear evidence that one proton pump inhibitor works better than another.

== History ==

PPIs were developed in the 1980s, with omeprazole being launched in 1988. Most of these medications are benzimidazole derivatives, related to omeprazole, but imidazopyridine derivatives such as tenatoprazole have also been developed. Potassium-competitive inhibitors such as revaprazan reversibly block the potassium-binding site of the proton pump, acting more quickly, but are not available in most countries.

== Society and culture ==
=== Economics ===
In British Columbia, Canada the cost of the PPIs varies significantly from to per dose while all agents in the class appear more or less equally effective.

=== Regulatory approval ===
A comparative table of FDA-approved indications for PPIs is shown below.

<doc id="24724" wikidata="Q182267" url="?curid=24724" title="Pan-Slavism">
<text>Pan-Slavism, a movement that took shape in the mid-19th century, is the political ideology concerned with promoting integrity and unity for the Slavic people. Its main impact occurred in the Balkans, where non-Slavic empires had ruled the South Slavs for centuries. These were mainly the Byzantine Empire, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Venice.

== Origins ==
Extensive pan-Slavism began much like Pan-Germanism: both of these movements flourished from the sense of unity and nationalism experienced within ethnic groups after the French Revolution and the consequent Napoleonic Wars against traditional European monarchies. As in other Romantic nationalist movements, Slavic intellectuals and scholars in the developing fields of history, philology, and folklore actively encouraged Slavs&#x27; interest in their shared identity and ancestry. Pan-Slavism co-existed with the Southern Slavic drive towards independence.

Commonly used symbols of the Pan-Slavic movement were the Pan-Slavic colours (blue, white and red) and the Pan-Slavic anthem, &quot;Hey, Slavs&quot;.

The first pan-Slavists were the 16th-century Croatian writer Vinko Pribojević, the Dalmatian Aleksandar Komulović (1548–1608), the Croat Bartol Kašić (1575–1650), the Ragusan Ivan Gundulić (1589–1638) and the Croatian Catholic missionary Juraj Križanić ( – 1683). Scholars such as Tomasz Kamusella have attributed early manifestations of Pan-Slavic thought within the Habsburg monarchy to the Slovaks Adam Franz Kollár (1718–1783) and Pavel Jozef Šafárik (1795–1861).
The Pan-Slavism movement grew rapidly following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. In the aftermath of the wars, the leaders of Europe sought to restore the pre-war &quot;status quo&quot;. At the Congress of Vienna of 1814–1815, Austria&#x27;s representative, Prince von Metternich, detected a threat to this &quot;status quo&quot; in the Austrian Empire through nationalists&#x27; demands for independence from the empire.
While Vienna&#x27;s subjects included numerous ethnic groups (such as Germans, Italians, Romanians, Hungarians, etc.), the Slav proportion of the population (Poles, Ruthenians, Ukrainians, Czechs, Slovaks, Slovenes, Serbs, Bosniaks and Croats) together formed a substantial—if not the largest—ethnic grouping.

== First Pan-Slav Congress, Prague, 1848 ==

The First Pan-Slav congress was held in Prague, Bohemia, in June 1848, during the revolutionary movement of 1848. The Czechs had refused to send representatives to the Frankfurt Assembly feeling that Slavs had a distinct interest from the Germans. The Austroslav, František Palacký, presided over the event. Most of the delegates were Czech and Slovak. Palacký called for the co-operation of the Habsburgs and had also endorsed the Habsburg monarchy as the political formation most likely to protect the peoples of central Europe. When the Germans asked him to declare himself in favour of their desire for national unity, he replied that he would not as this would weaken the Habsburg state: “Truly, if it were not that Austria had long existed, it would be necessary, in the interest of Europe, in the interest of humanity itself, to create it.”

The Pan-Slav congress met during the revolutionary turmoil of 1848. Young inhabitants of Prague had taken to the streets and in the confrontation, a stray bullet had killed the wife of Field Marshal Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz, the commander of the Austrian forces in Prague. Enraged, Windischgrätz seized the city, disbanded the congress, and established martial law throughout Bohemia.

== Pan-Slavism in the Czech lands and Slovakia ==


The first Pan-Slavic convention was held in Prague on June 2 through 16, 1848. The delegates at the Congress were specifically both anti-Austrian and anti-Russian. Still &quot;the Right&quot;—the moderately liberal wing of the Congress—under the leadership of František Palacký (1798–1876), a Czech historian and politician, and Pavol Jozef Šafárik (1795–1861), a Slovak philologist, historian and archaeologist, favored autonomy of the Slav lands within the framework of Austrian (Habsburg) monarchy. In contrast &quot;the Left&quot;—the radical wing of the Congress—under the leadership of Karel Sabina (1813–1877), a Czech writer and journalist, Josef Václav Frič, a Czech nationalist, Karol Libelt (1817–1861), a Polish writer and politician, and others, pressed for a close alliance with the revolutionary-democratic movement going on in Germany and Hungary in 1848.

A national rebirth in the Hungarian &quot;Upper Land&quot; (now Slovakia) awoke in a completely new light, both before the Slovak Uprising in 1848 and after. The driving force of this rebirth movement were Slovak writers and politicians who called themselves Štúrovci, the followers of Ľudovít Štúr. As the Slovak nobility was Magyarized and most Slovaks were merely farmers or priests, this movement failed to attract much attention. Nonetheless, the campaign was successful as brotherly cooperation between the Croats and the Slovaks brought its fruit throughout the war. Most of the battles between Slovaks and Hungarians however, did not turn out in favor for the Slovaks who were logistically supported by the Austrians, but not sufficiently. The shortage of manpower proved to be decisive as well.

During the war, the Slovak National Council brought its demands to the young Austrian Emperor, Franz Joseph I, who seemed to take a note of it and promised support for the Slovaks against the revolutionary radical Hungarians. However the moment the revolution was over, Slovak demands were forgotten. These demands included an autonomous land within the Austrian Empire called &quot;Slovenský kraj&quot; which would be eventually led by a Serbian prince. This act of ignorance from the Emperor convinced the Slovak and the Czech elite who proclaimed the concept of Austroslavism as dead.

Disgusted by the Emperor&#x27;s policy, in 1849, Ľudovít Štúr, the person who codified the first largely used Slovak language, wrote a book he would name &quot;Slavdom and the World of the Future&quot;. This book served as a manifesto where he noted that Austroslavism was not the way to go anymore. He also wrote a sentence that often serves as a quote until this day: &quot;Every nation has its time under God&#x27;s sun, and the linden [a symbol of the Slavs] is blossoming, while the oak [a symbol of the Teutons] bloomed long ago.&quot;

He expressed confidence in the Russian Empire however, as it was the only country of Slavs that was not dominated by anybody else, yet it was one of the most powerful nations in the world. He often symbolized Slavs as being a tree, with &quot;minor&quot; Slavic nations being branches while the trunk of the tree was Russian. His Pan-Slavic views were unleashed in this book, where he stated that the land of Slovaks should be annexed by the Tsar&#x27;s empire and that eventually, the population could be not only Russified, but also converted into the rite of Orthodoxy, religion originally spread by Cyril and Methodius during the times of Great Moravia, which served as an opposition to the Catholic missionaries from the Franks. After the Hungarian invasion of Pannonia, Hungarians converted into Catholicism, which effectively influenced the Slavs living in Pannonia and in the land south of the Lechs.

However, the Russian Empire often claimed Pan-Slavism as a justification for its aggressive moves in the Balkan Peninsula of Europe against the Ottoman Empire, which conquered and held the land of Slavs for centuries. This eventually led to the Balkan campaign of the Russian Empire, which resulted in the entire Balkan being liberated from the Ottoman Empire, with the help and the initiative of the Russian Empire. Pan-Slavism has some supporters among Czech and Slovak politicians, especially among the nationalistic and far-right ones, such as People&#x27;s Party – Our Slovakia.

During World War I, captured Slavic soldiers were asked to fight against &quot;oppression in the Austrian Empire&quot;. Consequently, some did. (see Czechoslovak Legions)

The creation of an independent Czechoslovakia made the old ideals of Pan-Slavism anachronistic. Relations with other Slavic states varied, sometimes being so tense it escalated into an armed conflict, such as with the Second Polish Republic where border clashes over Silesia resulted in a short hostile conflict, the Polish–Czechoslovak War. Even tensions between Czechs and Slovaks had appeared before and during World War II.

== Pan-Slavism among South Slavs ==
Pan-Slavism in the south, largely advocated by Serbs, would often turn to Russia for support. The Southern Slavic movement advocated the independence of the Slavic peoples in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Republic of Venice and the Ottoman Empire. Most Serbian intellectuals sought to unite all of the Southern, Balkan Slavs, whether Catholic (Croats, Slovenes), Muslim (Bosniaks, Pomaks), or Orthodox (Serbs, Macedonians, Bulgarians) as a &quot;Southern-Slavic nation of three faiths&quot;.

Austria feared that Pan-Slavists would endanger the empire. In Austria-Hungary Southern Slavs were distributed among several entities: Slovenes in the Austrian part (Carniola, Styria, Carinthia, Gorizia and Gradisca, Trieste, Istria), Croats and Serbs in the Hungarian part within the autonomous Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia and in the Austrian part within the autonomous Kingdom of Dalmatia, and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, under direct control from Vienna. Owing to a different position within Austria-Hungary, several different goals were prominent among the Southern Slavs of Austria-Hungary. A strong alternative to Pan-Slavism was Austroslavism, especially among the Croats and Slovenes. Because the Serbs were dispersed among several regions, and the fact that they had ties to the independent nation state of Kingdom of Serbia, they were among the strongest supporters of independence of South-Slavs from Austria-Hungary and uniting into a common state under Serbian monarchy.

When in 1863 the Association of Serbian Philology commemorated the death of Cyril a thousand years earlier, its president Dimitrije Matić talked of the creation of an &quot;ethnically pure&quot; Slavonic people, &quot;With God’s help, there should be a whole Slavonic people with purely Slavonic faces and of purely Slavonic character.&quot;

After World War I the creation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, under Serbian royalty of the Karađorđević dynasty, united most Southern Slavic-speaking nations regardless of religion and cultural background. The only ones they did not unite with were the Bulgarians. Still, in the years after the Second World War, there were proposals to incorporate Bulgaria into a Greater Yugoslavia thus uniting all south Slavic-speaking nations into one state. The idea was abandoned after the split between Josip Broz Tito and Joseph Stalin in 1948. This led to some bitter sentiment between the people of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria in the aftermath.

At the end of the Second World War, the Partisans&#x27; mixed heritage leader Josip Broz Tito became Yugoslav president, and the country become a socialist republic, with the motto of &quot;Brotherhood and Unity&quot; between its various Slavic peoples.

== Pan-Slavism in Poland ==
With the exception of Russia, the Polish nation has the distinction among other Slavic peoples of having enjoyed independence as a part of various entities for several centuries prior to the advent of Pan-Slavism.

After 1795, Revolutionary and Napoleonic France had influenced many Poles who sought the reconstitution of their existing country—particularly since France was a mutual enemy of Austria, Prussia, and also Russia. Russia&#x27;s Pan-Slavic rhetoric had alarmed the Poles. Pan-Slavism was not fully embraced among Poles after the early period. Poland did nevertheless express solidarity with those of its fellow Slavic nations that had suffered oppression and were seeking independence.

While Pan-Slavism as an ideology was inimical to Austro-Hungarian interests, Poles instead embraced the wide autonomy within the state and assumed a loyalist position towards the Habsburgs. Within the Austro-Hungarian polity, they were able to develop their national culture and preserve the Polish language, both of which were under threat in both German and Russian Empires. A Pan-Slavic federation was proposed, but on the condition that the Russian Empire would be excluded from such an entity. After Poland regained its independence (from Germany, Austria and Russia) in 1918, no internal faction considered Pan-Slavism as a serious alternative, viewing Pan-Slavism as &quot;Russification&quot;. During Poland&#x27;s communist era, the USSR used Pan-Slavism as a propaganda tool to justify its control over the country. The issue of Pan-Slavism was not part of current mainstream politics and is widely seen as an ideology of Russian imperialism.

== Pan-Slavism in Russia ==

During the time of the Soviet Union, Bolshevik teachings viewed Pan-Slavism as a reactionary element associated to the Russian Empire. As a result, Bolsheviks viewed it as contrary to their Marxist ideology. Pan-Slavists even faced persecution during the Stalinist repressions in the Soviet Union (see Slavists case). Nowadays, ultranationalist parties like the Russian National Unity party advocate for a Russian-dominated &#x27;Slavic Union&#x27;.

== Modern-day developments ==

The authentic idea of the unity of the Slavic people was all but gone after World War I when the maxim &quot;Versailles and Trianon have put an end to all Slavisms&quot;. During the Cold War, all Slavic peoples were in union under the dominance of the USSR, but pan-Slavism was rejected as reactionary to Communist ideals, and this unity was largely put to rest with the fall of communism in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s, leading to the breakup of federal states such as Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.
Varying relations between the Slavic countries exist nowadays; they range from mutual respect on equal footing and sympathy towards one another through traditional dislike and enmity, to indifference. No forms, other than culture and heritage oriented organizations, are currently considered forms of rapprochement among the countries with Slavic origins. The political parties which include Pan-Slavism as part of their program usually live on the fringe of the political spectrum, or are part of controlled and systemic opposition in Belarus, Russia and occupied territories, as part of an irredentist pan-slavist campaign by Russia.

A political concept of Euro-Slavism evolved from the idea that European integration will solve issues of Slavic peoples and promote peace, unity and cooperation on equal terms within the European Union. The concept seeks to resist strong multicultural tendencies from Western Europe, the dominant position of Germany, opposes Slavophilia, and typically encourages democracy and democratic values. Many Euroslavists believe it is possible to unite Slavic communities without exclusion of Russia from the European cultural area, but are also opposed to Russophilia and concepts of Slavs under Russian domination and irredentism. It is considered a modern form of Austro-Slavist and Neo-Slavist movements. Their origins date back to the middle of the 19th century, being first proposed by Czech liberal politician Karel Havlíček Borovský in 1846, when it was refined into a provisional political program by Czech politician František Palacký and completed by the first President of Czechoslovakia Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk in his work &quot;New Europe: Slavic Viewpoint&quot;.

== Contemporary views ==
While Pan-Slavism remains popular in moderate and extremist political circles, its popularity subsided in the public. After the failure of Yugoslavism and Czechoslovakism, nationalism in Slavic nations now focus on self-definition and non-ethnic relations (like Hungary and Poland). The Russo-Ukrainian War had a divisive role, and pro-Russian sentiment became less popular. Tensions also rose on the Ukrainian side, and for economic reasons Ukrainian grain exports had to be banned for a time in multiple Slavic countries such as Poland and Slovakia, after the protest of farmers in multiple European countries.

== Creation of pan-Slavic languages ==
Similarities of Slavic languages inspired many to create zonal auxiliary Pan-Slavic languages for all Slavic people to communicate with one another. Several such languages were constructed in the past, but many more were created in the Internet Age. The most prominent modern example is Interslavic.

== Popular culture ==
Pan-Slavic countries, organisations, and alliances appear in various works of fiction.

In the 2014 turn-based strategy 4X game &quot;&quot; there is a playable faction called the Slavic Federation – a science fiction vision of Eastern Europe and Western Asia, reformed into a powerful unified state with a focus on aerospace, technological research, and terrestrial engineering. Its leader, a former cosmonaut named Vadim Kozlov voiced by Mateusz Pawluczuk, speaks a mixture of Russian and Ukrainian with a heavy Polish accent. In the historical grand strategy games of &quot;Crusader Kings II&quot; and &quot;Europa Universalis IV&quot;, the player is able to unite Slavonic territories via political alliances and multi-ethnic kingdoms. The real-time strategy games &quot;Ancestors Legacy&quot; and the HD edition of &quot;Age of Empires II&quot; feature fictionalised versions of the early Slavs that incorporate and fuse elements from different Slavic nations.

<text>Pan-Germanism ( or &#x27;), also occasionally known asPan-Germanicism, is a [[pan-nationalism|pan-nationalist]] [[political ideology|political idea]]. Pan-Germanists originally sought to unify all the [[German-speaking Europe|German-speaking people]] – and possibly also non-German [[Germanic languages|Germanic-speaking peoples]] – in a single [[nation-state]] known asGreater Germany.


Pan-Germanism was highly influential in German politics in the 19th century during the unification of Germany when the German Empire was proclaimed as a nation-state in 1871 but without Habsburg Austria, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein (Kleindeutsche Lösung/Lesser Germany) and the first half of the 20th century in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the German Empire. From the late 19th century, many Pan-Germanist thinkers, since 1891 organized in the Pan-German League, had adopted openly ethnocentric and racist ideologies, and ultimately gave rise to the foreign policy &quot;Heim ins Reich&quot; pursued by Nazi Germany under Austrian-born Adolf Hitler from 1938, one of the primary factors leading to the outbreak of World War II. The concept of a Greater Germany was attempted to be put into practice as the [[Greater Germanic Reich]] (), fully styled the Greater Germanic Reich of the German Nation (). As a result of the Second World War, there was a clear backlash against Pan-Germanism and other related ideologies. Today, pan-Germanism is mainly limited to a few nationalist groups, mainly on the political far right in Germany and Austria.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;pan&quot; is a Greek word element meaning &quot;all, every, whole, all-inclusive&quot;. The word &quot;German&quot; in this context derives from Latin &quot;Germani&quot; originally used by Julius Caesar referring to tribes or a single tribe in northeastern Gaul. In the Late Middle Ages, it acquired a loose meaning referring to the speakers of Germanic languages some of whom spoke dialects ancestral to modern German. In English, &quot;Pan-German&quot; was first attested in 1892.

In German various concepts can be included under the heading of Pan-Germanism, though often with slight or significant differences in meaning. For example adjectives such as &quot;alldeutsch&quot; or &quot;gesamtdeutsch&quot;, which can be translated as &quot;pan-german&quot;, typically refer to the Alldeutsche Bewegung, a political movement which sought to unite all German speaking people in one country, whereas &quot;Pangermanismus&quot; can refer to both the pursuit of uniting all the German-speaking people and movements which sought to unify all speakers of Germanic languages.

== Origins (before 1860) ==
The origins of Pan-Germanism began with the birth of Romantic nationalism during the Napoleonic Wars, with Friedrich Ludwig Jahn and Ernst Moritz Arndt being early proponents. Germans, for the most part, had been a loose and disunited people since the Reformation, when the Holy Roman Empire was shattered into a patchwork of states following the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War with the Peace of Westphalia.

Advocates of the (Greater Germany) solution sought to unite all the German-speaking people in Europe, under the leadership of the German Austrians from the Austrian Empire. Pan-Germanism was widespread among the revolutionaries of 1848, notably among Richard Wagner and the Brothers Grimm. Writers such as Friedrich List and Paul Anton Lagarde argued for German hegemony in Central and Eastern Europe, where German domination in some areas had begun as early as the 9th century AD with the , Germanic expansion into Slavic and Baltic lands. For the Pan-Germanists, this movement was seen as a Drang nach Osten, in which Germans would be naturally inclined to seek Lebensraum by moving eastwards to reunite with the German minorities there.

The (&quot;Song of Germany&quot;), written in 1841 by Hoffmann von Fallersleben, in its first stanza defines &quot;Deutschland&quot; as reaching &quot;From the Meuse to the Memel / From the Adige to the Belt&quot;, i.e. as including East Prussia and South Tyrol.

Reflecting upon the First Schleswig War in 1848, Karl Marx noted in 1853 that &quot;by quarrelling amongst themselves, instead of confederating, Germans and Scandinavians, both of them belonging to the same great race, only prepare the way for their hereditary enemy, the Slav.&quot;

== The German Question ==
By the 1860s Prussia and Austria had become the two most powerful states dominated by German-speaking elites. Both sought to expand their influence and territory. The Austrian Empire—like the Holy Roman Empire—was a multi-ethnic state, but the German-speaking people there did not have an absolute numerical majority; its re-shaping into the Austro-Hungarian Empire was one result of the growing nationalism of other ethnicities—especially the Hungarians. Under Prussian leadership, Otto von Bismarck would ride on the coat-tails of nationalism to unite all of the northern German lands. After Bismarck excluded Austria and the German Austrians from Germany in the German war of 1866 and (following a few other events over the next few years), the unification of Germany, established the Prussian-dominated German Empire in 1871 with the proclamation of Wilhelm I as head of a union of German-speaking states, while disregarding millions of its non-German subjects who desired self-determination from German rule. After World War I the Pan-Germanist philosophy changed drastically during Adolf Hitler&#x27;s rise to power. Pan-Germanists originally sought to unify all the German-speaking populations of Europe in a single nation-state known as (Greater Germany), where &quot;German-speaking&quot; was sometimes taken as synonymous with Germanic-speaking, to the inclusion of the Frisian- and Dutch-speaking populations of the Low Countries, and Scandinavia.

Although Bismarck had excluded Austria and the German Austrians from his creation of the Kleindeutschland state in 1871, integrating the German Austrians nevertheless remained a strong desire for many people of both Austria and Germany. The most radical Austrian pan-German Georg Schönerer (1842–1921) and Karl Hermann Wolf (1862–1941) articulated Pan-Germanist sentiments in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. There was also a rejection of Roman Catholicism with the Away from Rome! movement (ca 1900 onwards) calling for German-speakers to identify with Lutheran or Old Catholic churches. The Pan-German Movement gained an institutional format in 1891, when Ernst Hasse, a professor at the University of Leipzig and a member of the Reichstag, organized the Pan-German League, an ultra-nationalist political-interest organization which promoted imperialism, antisemitism, and support for ethnic German minorities in other countries.
The organization achieved great support among the educated middle and upper class; it promoted German nationalist consciousness, especially among ethnic Germans outside Germany. In his three-volume work, &quot;Deutsche Politik&quot; (1905–07), Hasse called for German imperialist expansion in Europe. The Munich professor Karl Haushofer, Ewald Banse, and Hans Grimm (author of the novel &quot;Volk ohne Raum&quot;) preached similar expansionist policies.

During the German entry into World War I, Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg authorized the Septemberprogramm proposing that the German Empire use the First World War to seek territorial annexations similar to the ones demanded by pan-German nationalists. The West German historian Fritz Fischer argued in his 1962 thesis &quot;Germany&#x27;s Aims in the First World War&quot; that this and other documents indicated that Germany was responsible for World War I and intended to fulfill pan-German aims, although other historians have since disputed this conclusion. After Naval Minister Alfred von Tirpitz resigned from the Cabinet under pressure from Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg over Tirpitz&#x27;s push to introduce unrestricted submarine warfare, Tirpitz united pan-German nationalists under the German Fatherland Party in the Reichstag.

== Austria ==

After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Habsburg areas, in which the liberal nationalistic revolutionaries advocated the Greater German solution, the Austrian defeat in the Austro-Prussian War (1866) with the effect that Austria was now excluded from Germany, and increasing ethnic conflicts in the multinational Habsburg monarchy, a German national movement evolved in Austria. Led by the radical German nationalist and Austrian antisemite Georg Ritter von Schönerer, organisations such as the &quot;Pan-German Society&quot; demanded the annexation of all German-speaking territories under the rule of the Habsburg monarchy to the German Empire, and fervently rejected Austrian nationalism and a pan-Austrian identity. Schönerer&#x27;s völkisch and racist German nationalism was an inspiration to Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi ideology.

In 1933, Austrian Nazis and the national-liberal Greater German People&#x27;s Party formed an action group, fighting together against the Austrofascist Federal State of Austria which imposed a distinct Austrian national identity and in accordance said that Austrians were &quot;better Germans.&quot; Kurt Schuschnigg adopted a policy of appeasement towards Nazi Germany and called Austria the &quot;better German state&quot;, but he still struggled to keep Austria independent. With &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria in 1938, the historic aim of Austria&#x27;s German nationalists was achieved.

After the end of Nazi Germany and the events of World War II in 1945, the ideas of pan-Germanism and an &quot;Anschluss&quot; fell out of favour due to their association with Nazism and allowed Austrians to develop their own national identity. Nevertheless, such notions were revived with the German national camp in the Federation of Independents and the early Freedom Party of Austria.

== Scandinavia ==
The idea of including the North Germanic-speaking Scandinavians into a Pan-German state, sometimes referred to as Pan-Germanicism, was promoted alongside mainstream pan-German ideas. Jacob Grimm adopted Munch&#x27;s anti-Danish Pan-Germanism and argued that the entire peninsula of Jutland had been populated by Germans before the arrival of the Danes and that thus it could justifiably be reclaimed by Germany, whereas the rest of Denmark should be incorporated into Sweden. This line of thinking was countered by Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae, an archaeologist who had excavated parts of Danevirke, who argued that there was no way of knowing the language of the earliest inhabitants of Danish territory. He also pointed out that Germany had more solid historical claims to large parts of France and England, and that Slavs—by the same reasoning—could annex parts of Eastern Germany. Regardless of the strength of Worsaae&#x27;s arguments, pan-Germanism spurred on the German nationalists of Schleswig and Holstein and led to the First Schleswig War in 1848. In turn, this likely contributed to the fact that Pan-Germanism never caught on in Denmark as much as it did in Norway. Pan-Germanic tendencies were particularly widespread among the Norwegian independence movement. Prominent supporters included Peter Andreas Munch, Christopher Bruun, Knut Hamsun, Henrik Ibsen and Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson. Bjørnson, who wrote the lyrics for the Norwegian national anthem, proclaimed in 1901:

 In the 20th century the German Nazi Party sought to create a Greater Germanic Reich that would include most of the Germanic peoples of Europe within it under the leadership of Germany, including peoples such as the Danes, the Dutch, the Swedes, the Norwegians, and the Flemish within it.
Anti-German Scandinavism surged in Denmark in the 1930s and 1940s in response to the pan-Germanic ambitions of Nazi Germany.

== 1918 to 1945 ==
World War I became the first attempt to carry out the Pan-German ideology in practice, and the Pan-German movement argued forcefully for expansionist imperialism.

Following the defeat in World War I, the influence of German-speaking elites over Central and Eastern Europe was greatly limited. At the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was substantially reduced in size. Alsace-Lorraine was also influenced by the Francization after it returned to France. Austria-Hungary was split up. A rump Austria, which to a certain extent corresponded to the German-speaking areas of Austria-Hungary (a complete split into language groups was impossible due to multi-lingual areas and language-exclaves) adopted the name &quot;German Austria&quot; () in hope for union with Germany. Union with Germany and the name &quot;German Austria&quot; was forbidden by the Treaty of St. Germain and the name had to be changed back to Austria.

It was in the Weimar Republic that the Austrian-born Adolf Hitler, under the influence of the stab-in-the-back myth, first took up German nationalist ideas in his &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. Hitler met Heinrich Class in 1918, and Class provided Hitler with support for the 1923 Beer Hall Putsch. Hitler and his supporters shared most of the basic pan-German visions with the Pan-German League, but differences in political style led the two groups to open rivalry. The German Workers Party of Bohemia cut its ties to the pan-German movement, which was seen as being too dominated by the upper classes, and joined forces with the German Workers&#x27; Party led by Anton Drexler, which later became the Nazi Party (National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party, NSDAP) that was to be headed by Adolf Hitler from 1921.

Nazi propaganda also used the political slogan &quot;Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer&quot; (&quot;One people, one Reich, one leader&quot;), to enforce pan-German sentiment in Austria for an &quot;Anschluss&quot;.

The chosen name for the projected empire was a deliberate reference to the Holy Roman Empire (of the German Nation) that existed in the Middle Ages, known as the &quot;First Reich&quot; in Nazi historiography. Different aspects of the legacy of this medieval empire in German history were both celebrated and derided by the Nazi government. Hitler admired the Frankish Emperor Charlemagne for his &quot;cultural creativity&quot;, his powers of organization, and his renunciation of the rights of the individual. He criticized the Holy Roman Emperors however for not pursuing an &quot;Ostpolitik&quot; (Eastern Policy) resembling his own, while being politically focused exclusively on the south. After the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, Hitler ordered the old imperial regalia (the Imperial Crown, Imperial Sword, the Holy Lance and other items) residing in Vienna to be transferred to Nuremberg, where they were kept between 1424 and 1796. Nuremberg, in addition to being the former unofficial capital of the Holy Roman Empire, was also the place of the Nuremberg rallies. The transfer of the regalia was thus done to both legitimize Hitler&#x27;s Germany as the successor of the &quot;Old Reich&quot;, but also weaken Vienna, the former imperial residence.

After the 1939 German occupation of Bohemia, Hitler declared that the Holy Roman Empire had been &quot;resurrected&quot;, although he secretly maintained his own empire to be better than the old &quot;Roman&quot; one. Unlike the &quot;uncomfortably internationalist Catholic empire of Barbarossa&quot;, the Germanic Reich of the German Nation would be racist and nationalist. Rather than a return to the values of the Middle Ages, its establishment was to be &quot;a push forward to a new golden age, in which the best aspects of the past would be combined with modern racist and nationalist thinking&quot;.

The historical borders of the Holy Roman Empire were also used as grounds for territorial revisionism by the NSDAP, laying claim to modern territories and states that were once part of it. Even before the war, Hitler had dreamed of reversing the Peace of Westphalia, which had given the territories of the Empire almost complete sovereignty. On November 17, 1939, Reich Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels wrote in his diary that the &quot;total liquidation&quot; of this historic treaty was the &quot;great goal&quot; of the Nazi regime, and that since it had been signed in Münster, it would also be officially repealed in the same city.

The &quot;Heim ins Reich&quot; (&quot;Back Home to the Reich&quot;) initiative was a policy pursued by the Nazis which attempted to convince the ethnic Germans living outside of Nazi Germany (such as in Austria and Sudetenland) that they should strive to bring these regions &quot;home&quot; into a Greater Germany. This notion also led the way for an even more expansive state to be envisioned, the Greater Germanic Reich, which Nazi Germany tried to establish. This pan-Germanic empire was expected to assimilate practically all of Germanic Europe into an enormously expanded Greater Germanic Reich. Territorially speaking, this encompassed the already-enlarged Reich itself (consisting of pre-1938 Germany plus the areas annexed into the &quot;Großdeutsche Reich&quot;), the Netherlands, Belgium, areas in north-eastern France considered to be historically and ethnically Germanic, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Iceland, at least the German-speaking parts of Switzerland, and Liechtenstein. The most notable exception was the predominantly Anglo-Saxon United Kingdom, which was not projected as having to be reduced to a German province but to instead become an allied seafaring partner of the Germans.

The eastern &quot;Reichskommissariats&quot; in the vast stretches of Ukraine and Russia were also intended for future integration, with plans for them stretching to the Volga or even beyond the Urals. They were deemed of vital interest for the survival of the German nation, as it was a core tenet of Nazi ideology that it needed &quot;living space&quot; (&quot;Lebensraum&quot;), creating a &quot;pull towards the East&quot; (&quot;Drang nach Osten&quot;) where that could be found and colonized, in a model that the Nazis explicitly derived from the American Manifest Destiny in the Far West and its clearing of native inhabitants.

As the foreign volunteers of the Waffen-SS were increasingly of non-Germanic origin, especially after the Battle of Stalingrad, among the organization&#x27;s leadership (e.g. Felix Steiner) the proposition for a Greater Germanic Empire gave way to a concept of a European union of self-governing states, unified by German hegemony and the common enemy of Bolshevism. The Waffen-SS was to be the eventual nucleus of a common European army where each state would be represented by a national contingent. Himmler himself, however, gave no concession to these views, and held on to his Pan-Germanic vision in a speech given in April 1943 to the officers of the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, the 2nd SS Panzer Division &quot;Das Reich&quot; and the 3rd SS Division &quot;Totenkopf&quot;:

== History since 1945 ==

The defeat of Germany in World War II brought about the decline of Pan-Germanism, much as World War I had led to the demise of Pan-Slavism. Parts of Germany itself were devastated, and the country was divided, firstly into Soviet, French, American, and British zones and then into West Germany and East Germany. Austria was separated from Germany and the German identity in Austria was also weakened. The end of World War II in Europe brought even larger territorial losses for Germany than the First World War, with vast portions of eastern Germany directly annexed by the Soviet Union and Poland. The scale of the Germans&#x27; defeat was unprecedented; Pan-Germanism became taboo because it had been tied to racist concepts of the &quot;master race&quot; and &quot;Nordicism&quot; by the Nazi party. However, the reunification of Germany in 1990 revived the old debates.

<text>Patrick Abercromby (1656) was a Scottish physician and antiquarian, noted for being physician to King James VII (II of England) and his fervent opposition to the Act of Union between Scotland and England.

==Early life==
Patrick Abercromby was the third son of Alexander Abercromby of Fetterneir in Aberdeenshire, and brother of Francis Abercromby, who was created Lord Glasford by King James II. He was born at Forfar in 1656 apparently of a Roman Catholic family.

Intending to become a doctor of medicine he entered the University of St Andrews, where he took his degree of M.D. in 1685, but apparently he spent most of his youthful years abroad. It has been stated that he attended the university of Paris, France. &quot;A Discourse of Wit&quot; (1685), sometimes assigned to him, belongs to Dr David Abercromby.

==Return to Scotland==
On his return to Scotland, Patrick Abercromby is found practising as a physician in Edinburgh, where, besides his professional duties, he gave himself with characteristic zeal to the study of antiquities. He was appointed physician to James II in 1685, but the revolution deprived him of the post. Living during the agitations for the union of England and Scotland, he took part as a Jacobite in the war of pamphlets inaugurated and sustained by prominent men on both sides of the Border, and he crossed swords with no less redoubtable a foe than Daniel Defoe in his &quot;Advantages of the Act of Security compared with those of the intended Union&quot; (Edinburgh, 1707), and &quot;A Vindication of the Same against Mr De Foe&quot; (ibid.).

==Continued work ==
A minor literary work of Abercromby&#x27;s was a translation of Jean de Beaugué&#x27;s &quot;Histoire de la guerre d&#x27;Écosse&quot; (1556) which appeared in 1707. But the work with which his name is permanently associated is his &quot;Martial Atchievements &quot;[sic]&quot; of the Scots Nation&quot;, issued in two large folios, vol. i. 1711, vol. ii. 1715. In the title-page and preface to vol. i. he disclaims the ambition of being an historian, but in vol. ii., in title-page and preface alike, he is no longer a simple biographer, but an historian. He was a laborious and accomplished reader and investigator of all available authorities, as well manuscript as printed; while the roll of names of those who aided him includes every man of note in Scotland at the time, from Sir Thomas Craig and Sir George Mackenzie to Alexander Nisbet and Thomas Ruddiman.

==Death==
The date of Abercromby&#x27;s death is uncertain. It has been variously assigned to 1715, 1716, 1720, and 1726, and it is usually added that he left a widow in great poverty. The Memoirs of the Abercrombys, commonly attributed to him, do not appear to have been published.

<doc id="24731" wikidata="Q3229" url="?curid=24731" title="Positron">
<text>The positron or antielectron is the particle with an electric charge of +1&quot;e&quot;, a spin of 1/2 (the same as the electron), and the same mass as an electron. It is the antiparticle (antimatter counterpart) of the electron. When a positron collides with an electron, annihilation occurs. If this collision occurs at low energies, it results in the production of two or more photons.

Positrons can be created by positron emission radioactive decay (through weak interactions), or by pair production from a sufficiently energetic photon which is interacting with an atom in a material.

== History ==

=== Theory ===

In 1928, Paul Dirac published a paper proposing that electrons can have both a positive and negative charge. This paper introduced the Dirac equation, a unification of quantum mechanics, special relativity, and the then-new concept of electron spin to explain the Zeeman effect. The paper did not explicitly predict a new particle but did allow for electrons having either positive or negative energy as solutions. Hermann Weyl then published a paper discussing the mathematical implications of the negative energy solution. The positive-energy solution explained experimental results, but Dirac was puzzled by the equally valid negative-energy solution that the mathematical model allowed. Quantum mechanics did not allow the negative energy solution to simply be ignored, as classical mechanics often did in such equations; the dual solution implied the possibility of an electron spontaneously jumping between positive and negative energy states. However, no such transition had yet been observed experimentally.

Dirac wrote a follow-up paper in December 1929 that attempted to explain the unavoidable negative-energy solution for the relativistic electron. He argued that &quot;... an electron with negative energy moves in an external [electromagnetic] field as though it carries a positive charge.&quot; He further asserted that all of space could be regarded as a &quot;sea&quot; of negative energy states that were filled, so as to prevent electrons jumping between positive energy states (negative electric charge) and negative energy states (positive charge). The paper also explored the possibility of the proton being an island in this sea, and that it might actually be a negative-energy electron. Dirac acknowledged that the proton having a much greater mass than the electron was a problem, but expressed &quot;hope&quot; that a future theory would resolve the issue.

Robert Oppenheimer argued strongly against the proton being the negative-energy electron solution to Dirac&#x27;s equation. He asserted that if it were, the hydrogen atom would rapidly self-destruct. Weyl in 1931 showed that the negative-energy electron must have the same mass as that of the positive-energy electron. Persuaded by Oppenheimer&#x27;s and Weyl&#x27;s argument, Dirac published a paper in 1931 that predicted the existence of an as-yet-unobserved particle that he called an &quot;anti-electron&quot; that would have the same mass and the opposite charge as an electron and that would mutually annihilate upon contact with an electron.

Ernst Stueckelberg, and later Richard Feynman, proposed an interpretation of the positron as an electron moving backward in time, reinterpreting the negative-energy solutions of the Dirac equation. Electrons moving backward in time would have a positive electric charge. John Archibald Wheeler invoked this concept to explain the identical properties shared by all electrons, suggesting that &quot;they are all the same electron&quot; with a complex, self-intersecting worldline. Yoichiro Nambu later applied it to all production and annihilation of particle-antiparticle pairs, stating that &quot;the eventual creation and annihilation of pairs that may occur now and then is no creation or annihilation, but only a change of direction of moving particles, from the past to the future, or from the future to the past.&quot; The backwards in time point of view is nowadays accepted as completely equivalent to other pictures, but it does not have anything to do with the macroscopic terms &quot;cause&quot; and &quot;effect&quot;, which do not appear in a microscopic physical description.

=== Experimental clues and discovery ===
Several sources have claimed that Dmitri Skobeltsyn first observed the positron long before 1930, or even as early as 1923. They state that while using a Wilson cloud chamber in order to study the Compton effect, Skobeltsyn detected particles that acted like electrons but curved in the opposite direction in an applied magnetic field, and that he presented photographs with this phenomenon in a conference in the University of Cambridge, on 23–27 July 1928. In his book on the history of the positron discovery from 1963, Norwood Russell Hanson has given a detailed account of the reasons for this assertion, and this may have been the origin of the myth. But he also presented Skobeltsyn&#x27;s objection to it in an appendix. Later, Skobeltsyn rejected this claim even more strongly, calling it &quot;nothing but sheer nonsense&quot;.

Skobeltsyn did pave the way for the eventual discovery of the positron by two important contributions: adding a magnetic field to his cloud chamber (in 1925), and by discovering charged particle cosmic rays, for which he is credited in Carl David Anderson&#x27;s Nobel lecture. Skobeltsyn did observe likely positron tracks on images taken in 1931, but did not identify them as such at the time.

Likewise, in 1929 Chung-Yao Chao, a Chinese graduate student at Caltech, noticed some anomalous results that indicated particles behaving like electrons, but with a positive charge, though the results were inconclusive and the phenomenon was not pursued. Fifty years later, Anderson acknowledged that his discovery was inspired by the work of his Caltech classmate Chung-Yao Chao, whose research formed the foundation from which much of Anderson&#x27;s work developed but was not credited at the time.

Anderson discovered the positron on 2 August 1932, for which he won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1936. Anderson did not coin the term &quot;positron&quot;, but allowed it at the suggestion of the &quot;Physical Review&quot; journal editor to whom he submitted his discovery paper in late 1932. The positron was the first evidence of antimatter and was discovered when Anderson allowed cosmic rays to pass through a cloud chamber and a lead plate. A magnet surrounded this apparatus, causing particles to bend in different directions based on their electric charge. The ion trail left by each positron appeared on the photographic plate with a curvature matching the mass-to-charge ratio of an electron, but in a direction that showed its charge was positive.

Anderson wrote in retrospect that the positron could have been discovered earlier based on Chung-Yao Chao&#x27;s work, if only it had been followed up on. Frédéric and Irène Joliot-Curie in Paris had evidence of positrons in old photographs when Anderson&#x27;s results came out, but they had dismissed them as protons.

The positron had also been contemporaneously discovered by Patrick Blackett and Giuseppe Occhialini at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1932. Blackett and Occhialini had delayed publication to obtain more solid evidence, so Anderson was able to publish the discovery first.

== Natural production ==

Positrons are produced, together with neutrinos naturally in β+ decays of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes (for example, potassium-40) and in interactions of gamma quanta (emitted by radioactive nuclei) with matter. Antineutrinos are another kind of antiparticle produced by natural radioactivity (β− decay). Many different kinds of antiparticles are also produced by (and contained in) cosmic rays. In research published in 2011 by the American Astronomical Society, positrons were discovered originating above thunderstorm clouds; positrons are produced in gamma-ray flashes created by electrons accelerated by strong electric fields in the clouds. Antiprotons have also been found to exist in the Van Allen Belts around the Earth by the PAMELA module.

Antiparticles, of which the most common are antineutrinos and positrons due to their low mass, are also produced in any environment with a sufficiently high temperature (mean particle energy greater than the pair production threshold). During the period of baryogenesis, when the universe was extremely hot and dense, matter and antimatter were continually produced and annihilated. The presence of remaining matter, and absence of detectable remaining antimatter, also called baryon asymmetry, is attributed to CP-violation: a violation of the CP-symmetry relating matter to antimatter. The exact mechanism of this violation during baryogenesis remains a mystery.

Positron production from radioactive decay can be considered both artificial and natural production, as the generation of the radioisotope can be natural or artificial. Perhaps the best known naturally-occurring radioisotope which produces positrons is potassium-40, a long-lived isotope of potassium which occurs as a primordial isotope of potassium. Even though it is a small percentage of potassium (0.0117%), it is the single most abundant radioisotope in the human body. In a human body of mass, about 4,400 nuclei of 40K decay per second. The activity of natural potassium is 31 Bq/g. About 0.001% of these 40K decays produce about 4000 natural positrons per day in the human body. These positrons soon find an electron, undergo annihilation, and produce pairs of 511 keV photons, in a process similar (but much lower intensity) to that which happens during a PET scan nuclear medicine procedure.

Recent observations indicate black holes and neutron stars produce vast amounts of positron-electron plasma in astrophysical jets. Large clouds of positron-electron plasma have also been associated with neutron stars.

=== Observation in cosmic rays ===

Satellite experiments have found evidence of positrons (as well as a few antiprotons) in primary cosmic rays, amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays. However, the fraction of positrons in cosmic rays has been measured more recently with improved accuracy, especially at much higher energy levels, and the fraction of positrons has been seen to be greater in these higher energy cosmic rays.

These do not appear to be the products of large amounts of antimatter from the Big Bang, or indeed complex antimatter in the universe (evidence for which is lacking, see below). Rather, the antimatter in cosmic rays appear to consist of only these two elementary particles. Recent theories suggest the source of such positrons may come from annihilation of dark matter particles, acceleration of positrons to high energies in astrophysical objects, and production of high energy positrons in the interactions of cosmic ray nuclei with interstellar gas.

Preliminary results from the presently operating Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (&quot;AMS-02&quot;) on board the International Space Station show that positrons in the cosmic rays arrive with no directionality, and with energies that range from 0.5 to 500 GeV. Positron fraction peaks at a maximum of about 16% of total electron+positron events, around an energy of 275 ± 32 GeV. At higher energies, up to 500 GeV, the ratio of positrons to electrons begins to fall again. The absolute flux of positrons also begins to fall before 500 GeV, but peaks at energies far higher than electron energies, which peak about 10 GeV. These results on interpretation have been suggested to be due to positron production in annihilation events of massive dark matter particles.

Positrons, like anti-protons, do not appear to originate from any hypothetical &quot;antimatter&quot; regions of the universe. On the contrary, there is no evidence of complex antimatter atomic nuclei, such as antihelium nuclei (i.e., anti-alpha particles), in cosmic rays. These are actively being searched for. A prototype of the &quot;AMS-02&quot; designated &quot;AMS-01&quot;, was flown into space aboard the on STS-91 in June 1998. By not detecting any antihelium at all, the &quot;AMS-01&quot; established an upper limit of 1.1×10−6 for the antihelium to helium flux ratio.

== Artificial production ==
Physicists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California have used a short, ultra-intense laser to irradiate a millimeter-thick gold target and produce more than 100 billion positrons. Presently significant lab production of 5 MeV positron-electron beams allows investigation of multiple characteristics such as how different elements react to 5 MeV positron interactions or impacts, how energy is transferred to particles, and the shock effect of gamma-ray bursts.

In 2023, a collaboration between CERN and University of Oxford performed an experiment at the HiRadMat facility in which nano-second duration beams of electron-positron pairs were produced containing more than 10 trillion electron-positron pairs, so creating the first &#x27;pair plasma&#x27; in the laboratory with sufficient density to support collective plasma behavior. Future experiments offer the possibility to study physics relevant to extreme astrophysical environments where copious electron-positron pairs are generated, such as gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts and blazar jets.

== Applications ==
Certain kinds of particle accelerator experiments involve colliding positrons and electrons at relativistic speeds. The high impact energy and the mutual annihilation of these matter/antimatter opposites create a fountain of diverse subatomic particles. Physicists study the results of these collisions to test theoretical predictions and to search for new kinds of particles.

The ALPHA experiment combines positrons with antiprotons to study properties of antihydrogen.

Gamma rays, emitted indirectly by a positron-emitting radionuclide (tracer), are detected in positron emission tomography (PET) scanners used in hospitals. PET scanners create detailed three-dimensional images of metabolic activity within the human body.

An experimental tool called positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) is used in materials research to detect variations in density, defects, displacements, or even voids, within a solid material.

<text>Phencyclidine or phenylcyclohexyl piperidine (PCP), also known in its use as a street drug as angel dust among other names, is a dissociative anesthetic mainly used recreationally for its significant mind-altering effects. PCP may cause hallucinations, distorted perceptions of sounds, and psychotic behavior. As a recreational drug, it is typically smoked, but may be taken by mouth, snorted, or injected. It may also be mixed with cannabis or tobacco.
Adverse effects may include paranoia, addiction, and an increased risk of suicide, also seizures and coma in case of overdose. Flashbacks may occur despite stopping usage. Chemically, PCP is a member of the arylcyclohexylamine class. PCP works primarily as an NMDA receptor antagonist.
PCP is most commonly used in the US. While usage peaked in the US in the 1970s, between 2005 and 2011, an increase in visits to emergency departments as a result of the drug occurred. As of 2022, in the US, about 0.7% of 12th grade students reported using PCP in the prior year, while 1.7% of people in the US over age 25 reported using it at some point in their lives.


==Recreational uses==

Phencyclidine is used for its ability to induce a dissociative state.

===Effects===
Behavioral effects can vary by dosage. Low doses produce numbness in the extremities and intoxication, characterized by staggering, unsteady gait, slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, and loss of balance. Moderate doses (5–10 mg intranasal, or 0.01–0.02 mg/kg intramuscular or intravenous) will produce analgesia and anesthesia. High doses may lead to convulsions. The drug is often illegally produced under poorly controlled conditions; this means that users may be unaware of the actual dose they are taking.

Psychological effects include severe changes in body image, loss of ego boundaries, paranoia, and depersonalization. Psychosis, agitation and dysphoria, hallucinations, blurred vision, euphoria, and suicidal impulses are also reported, as well as occasional aggressive behavior. Like many other drugs, PCP has been known to alter mood states unpredictably, causing some individuals to become detached, and others to become animated. PCP may induce feelings of strength, power, and invulnerability as well as a numbing effect on the mind.

Studies by the Drug Abuse Warning Network in the 1970s show that media reports of PCP-induced violence are greatly exaggerated and that incidents of violence are unusual and often limited to individuals with reputations for aggression regardless of drug use. Although uncommon, events of PCP-intoxicated individuals acting in an unpredictable fashion, possibly driven by their delusions or hallucinations, have been publicized. Other commonly cited types of incidents include inflicting property damage and self-mutilation of various types, such as pulling out one&#x27;s teeth. These effects were not noted in its medicinal use in the 1950s and 1960s, however, reports of physical violence on PCP have often been shown to be unfounded.

Recreational doses of the drug also occasionally appear to induce a psychotic state, with emotional and cognitive impairment that resembles a schizophrenic episode. Users generally report feeling detached from reality.

Symptoms are summarized by the mnemonic device RED DANES: rage, erythema (redness of skin), dilated pupils, delusions, amnesia, nystagmus (oscillation of the eyeball when moving laterally), excitation, and skin dryness.

===Addiction===
PCP is self-administered and induces ΔFosB expression in the D1-type medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens, and accordingly, excessive PCP use is known to cause addiction. PCP&#x27;s rewarding and reinforcing effects are at least partly mediated by blocking the NMDA receptors in the glutamatergic inputs to D1-type medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens. PCP has been shown to produce conditioned place aversion and conditioned place preference in animal studies.

===Schizophrenia===
A 2019 review found that the transition rate from a diagnosis of hallucinogen-induced psychosis (which included PCP) to that of schizophrenia was 26%. This was lower than cannabis-induced psychosis (34%) but higher than amphetamine (22%), opioid (12%), alcohol (10%), and sedative (9%) induced psychoses. In comparison, the transition rate to schizophrenia for &quot;brief, atypical and not otherwise specified&quot; psychosis was found to be 36%.

===Methods of administration===

PCP has multiple routes of administration. Most commonly, the powder form of the drug is snorted. PCP can also be orally ingested, injected subcutaneously or intravenously, or smoked laced with marijuana or cigarettes.
* PCP can be ingested through smoking. &quot;Fry&quot; and &quot;sherm&quot; are street terms for marijuana or tobacco cigarettes that are dipped in PCP and then dried.
* PCP hydrochloride can be insufflated (snorted), depending upon the purity. This is most often referred to as &quot;angel dust&quot;. 
* An oral pill can also be compressed from the co-compounded powder form of the drug. This is usually referred to as &quot;peace pill&quot;.
* The free base is hydrophobic and may be absorbed through skin and mucous membranes (often inadvertently). This form of the drug is commonly called &quot;wack&quot;.

==Management of intoxication==
Management of PCP intoxication mostly consists of supportive care – controlling breathing, circulation, and body temperature – and, in the early stages, treating psychiatric symptoms. Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam, are the drugs of choice to control agitation and seizures (when present). Typical antipsychotics such as phenothiazines and haloperidol have been used to control psychotic symptoms, but may produce many undesirable side effects – such as dystonia – and their use is therefore no longer preferred; phenothiazines are particularly risky, as they may lower the seizure threshold, worsen hyperthermia, and boost the anticholinergic effects of PCP. If an antipsychotic is given, intramuscular haloperidol has been recommended.

Forced acid diuresis (with ammonium chloride or, more safely, ascorbic acid) may increase the clearance of PCP from the body, and was somewhat controversially recommended in the past as a decontamination measure. However, it is now known that only around 10% of a dose of PCP is removed by the kidneys, which would make increased urinary clearance of little consequence; furthermore, urinary acidification is dangerous, as it may induce acidosis and worsen rhabdomyolysis (muscle breakdown), a not-unusual manifestation of PCP toxicity.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
PCP is well known for its primary action on the NMDA receptor, an ionotropic glutamate receptor. As such, PCP is a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist. The role of NMDAR antagonism in the effect of PCP, ketamine, and related dissociative agents was first published in the early 1980s by David Lodge and colleagues. Other NMDA receptor antagonists include ketamine, tiletamine, dextromethorphan, nitrous oxide, and dizocilpine (MK-801).

Research also indicates that PCP inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) among other mechanisms. Analogues of PCP exhibit varying potency at nACh receptors and NMDA receptors. Findings demonstrate that presynaptic nAChRs and NMDA receptor interactions influence the postsynaptic maturation of glutamatergic synapses and consequently impact synaptic development and plasticity in the brain. These effects can lead to inhibition of excitatory glutamate activity in certain brain regions such as the hippocampus and cerebellum thus potentially leading to memory loss as one of the effects of prolonged use. Acute effects on the cerebellum manifest as changes in blood pressure, breathing rate, pulse rate, and loss of muscular coordination during intoxication.

PCP, like ketamine, also acts as a potent dopamine D2High receptor partial agonist in rat brain homogenate and has affinity for the human cloned D2High receptor. This activity may be associated with some of the other more psychotic features of PCP intoxication, which is evidenced by the successful use of D2 receptor antagonists (such as haloperidol) in the treatment of PCP psychosis.

In addition to its well explored interactions with NMDA receptors, PCP has also been shown to inhibit dopamine reuptake, and thereby leads to increased extracellular levels of dopamine and hence increased dopaminergic neurotransmission. However, PCP has little affinity for the human monoamine transporters, including the dopamine transporter (DAT). Instead, its inhibition of monoamine reuptake may be mediated by interactions with allosteric sites on the monoamine transporters. PCP is notably a high-affinity ligand of the PCP site 2 (Ki = 154 nM), a not-well-characterized site associated with monoamine reuptake inhibition.

Studies on rats indicate that PCP interacts indirectly with opioid receptors (endorphin and enkephalin) to produce analgesia.

A binding study assessed PCP at 56 sites including neurotransmitter receptors and transporters and found that PCP had Ki values of &gt;10,000 nM at all sites except the dizocilpine (MK-801) site of the NMDA receptor (Ki = 59 nM), the σ2 receptor (PC12) (Ki = 136 nM), and the serotonin transporter (Ki = 2,234 nM). The study notably found Ki values of &gt;10,000 nM for the D2 receptor, the opioid receptors, the σ1 receptor, and the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. These results suggest that PCP is a highly selective ligand of the NMDAR and σ2 receptor. However, PCP may also interact with allosteric sites on the monoamine transporters to produce inhibition of monoamine reuptake.

===Mechanism of action===
Phencyclidine is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist that blocks the activity of the NMDA receptor to cause anaesthesia and analgesia without causing cardiorespiratory depression. NMDA is an excitatory receptor in the brain, when activated normally the receptor acts as an ion channel and there is an influx of positive ions through the channel to cause nerve cell depolarisation. Phencyclidine inhibits the NMDA receptor by binding to the specific PCP binding site located within the ion channel. The PCP binding site is within close proximity to the magnesium blocking site, which may explain the similar inhibitory effects. Binding at the PCP site is mediated by two non-covalent interactions within the receptor: hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction. Binding is also controlled by the gating mechanism of the ion channel. Because the PCP site is located within the ion channel, a coagonist such as glycine must bind and open the channel for PCP to enter, bind to the PCP site, and block the channel.

====Neurotoxicity====
Some studies found that, like other NMDA receptor antagonists, PCP can cause a kind of brain damage called Olney&#x27;s lesions in rats. Studies conducted on rats showed that high doses of the NMDA receptor antagonist dizocilpine caused reversible vacuoles to form in certain regions of the rats&#x27; brains. All studies of Olney&#x27;s lesions have only been performed on non-human animals and may not apply to humans. One unpublished study by Frank Sharp reportedly showed no damage by the NMDA antagonist ketamine, a structurally similar drug, far beyond recreational doses, but due to the study never having been published, its validity is controversial.

PCP has also been shown to cause schizophrenia-like changes in &quot;N&quot;-acetylaspartate and &quot;N&quot;-acetylaspartylglutamate levels in the rat brain, which are detectable both in living rats and upon necropsy examination of brain tissue. It also induces symptoms in humans that mimic schizophrenia. PCP not only produced symptoms similar to schizophrenia, it also yielded electroencephalogram changes in the thalamocortical pathway (increased delta decreased alpha) and in the hippocampus (increase theta bursts) that were similar to those in schizophrenia. PCP-induced augmentation of dopamine release may link the NMDA and dopamine hypotheses of schizophrenia.

===Pharmacokinetics===

PCP is both water and lipid-soluble and is therefore distributed throughout the body quickly. PCP is metabolized into PCHP, PPC and PCAA. The drug is metabolized 90% by oxidative hydroxylation in the liver during the first pass. Metabolites are glucuronidated and excreted in the urine. Nine percent of ingested PCP is excreted in its unchanged form.

When smoked, some of the compound is broken down by heat into 1-phenylcyclohexene (PC) and piperidine.

The time taken before the effects of PCP manifest is dependent on the route of administration. The onset of action for inhalation occurs in 2–5 minutes, whereas the effects may take 15 to 60 minutes when ingested orally.

==Chemistry==
PCP is an arylcyclohexylamine.

===Analogues===
Fewer than 30 different analogs of PCP were reported as being used as a street drug during the 1970s and 1980s, mainly in the United States. Only of a few of these compounds were widely used including rolicyclidine (PCPy), eticyclidine (PCE), and tenocyclidine (TCP). Less common analogs include 3-HO-PCP, 3-MeO-PCMo, and 3-MeO-PCP.

The generalized structural motif required for PCP-like activity is derived from structure-activity relationship studies of PCP derivatives. All of these derivatives are likely to share some of their psychoactive effects with PCP itself, although a range of potencies and varying mixtures of anesthetic, dissociative, and stimulant effects are known, depending on the particular drug and its substituents. In the United States, all of these compounds would be considered controlled substance analogs of PCP under the Federal Analog Act and are hence illegal drugs if sold for human consumption.

==History==
Phencyclidine was initially discovered in 1926 by and his student Paul Merkel as a product of a Grignard reaction of 1-piperidinocyclohexancarbonitrile.

It was again synthesized in 1956 by chemist H Victor Maddox and brought to market as an anesthetic medication by pharmaceutical company Parke-Davis, now a subsidiary of Pfizer. Its use in humans was disallowed in the US in 1965 due to the high rates of side effects, while its use in animals was disallowed in 1978. Moreover, ketamine was discovered and was better tolerated as an anesthetic. 

PCP is classified as a schedule II drug in the US. Derivatives of PCP have been sold for recreational and non-medical use.

==Society and culture==

===Regulation===
PCP is a Schedule II substance in the US. The Administrative Controlled Substances Code Number (ACSCN) for PCP is 7471. Its manufacturing quota for 2014 was . It is a Schedule I drug by the Controlled Drugs and Substances act in Canada, a List I drug of the Opium Law in the Netherlands, and a Class A substance in the UK.

===Frequency of use===
PCP began to emerge as a recreational drug in major cities in the US in the 1960s. In 1978, &quot;People&quot; magazine and Mike Wallace of the TV news program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; called PCP the country&#x27;s &quot;number one drug problem&quot;. Although recreational use of the drug had always been relatively low, it began declining significantly in the 1980s. In surveys, the number of high school students admitting to trying PCP at least once fell from 13% in 1979 to less than 3% in 1990.

===Cultural depictions===
Jean-Michel Basquiat depicted two angel dust users in his 1982 painting &quot;Dustheads&quot;.

Tsukasa Hojo&#x27;s 1985 manga &quot;City Hunter&quot; features a drug, Angel Dust, presumably a reference to PCP&#x27;s street name. The related 2023 animated film, &quot;City Hunter: Angel Dust&quot;, more directly moved the franchise&#x27;s angel dust into the realm of fantasy, as it is portrayed as a science fiction nanomachine serum developed by a biotech company to create super-soldiers with a tendency to drive them berserk, side-stepping the real-life PCP. 

In Vivienne Medrano&#x27;s adult animated musical comedy television series &quot;Hazbin Hotel&quot;, Angel Dust is an adult film star in Hell and one of the main protagonists, who in Hell took on the name &quot;Angel Dust&quot; as his chosen all-encompassing persona name, and one he uses exclusively in place of his actual name. It is intended as multipurpose for both his drag queen persona and his sex-work persona.

<doc id="24734" wikidata="Q338585" url="?curid=24734" title="Product of group subsets">
<text>In mathematics, one can define a product of group subsets in a natural way. If &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are subsets of a group &quot;G&quot;, then their product is the subset of &quot;G&quot; defined by
:formula_1
The subsets &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; need not be subgroups for this product to be well defined. The associativity of this product follows from that of the group product. The product of group subsets therefore defines a natural monoid structure on the power set of &quot;G&quot;.

A lot more can be said in the case where &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are subgroups. The product of two subgroups &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; of a group &quot;G&quot; is itself a subgroup of &quot;G&quot; if and only if &quot;ST&quot; = &quot;TS&quot;.

== Product of subgroups ==
If &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are subgroups of &quot;G&quot;, their product need not be a subgroup (for example, two distinct subgroups of order 2 in the symmetric group on 3 symbols). This product is sometimes called the &quot;Frobenius product&quot;. In general, the product of two subgroups &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; is a subgroup if and only if &quot;ST&quot; = &quot;TS&quot;, and the two subgroups are said to permute. (Walter Ledermann has called this fact the &quot;Product Theorem&quot;, but this name, just like &quot;Frobenius product&quot; is by no means standard.) In this case, &quot;ST&quot; is the group generated by &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;; i.e., &quot;ST&quot; = &quot;TS&quot; = ⟨&quot;S&quot; ∪ &quot;T&quot;⟩.

If either &quot;S&quot; or &quot;T&quot; is normal then the condition &quot;ST&quot; = &quot;TS&quot; is satisfied and the product is a subgroup. If both &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are normal, then the product is normal as well.

If &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are finite subgroups of a group &quot;G&quot;, then &quot;ST&quot; is a subset of &quot;G&quot; of size &quot;|ST|&quot; given by the &quot;product formula&quot;:
:formula_2
Note that this applies even if neither &quot;S&quot; nor &quot;T&quot; is normal.

=== Modular law ===

The following modular law (for groups) holds for any &quot;Q&quot; a subgroup of &quot;S&quot;, where &quot;T&quot; is any other arbitrary subgroup (and both &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are subgroups of some group &quot;G&quot;):
:&quot;Q&quot;(&quot;S&quot; ∩ &quot;T&quot;) = &quot;S&quot; ∩ (&quot;QT&quot;).
The two products that appear in this equality are not necessarily subgroups.

If &quot;QT&quot; is a subgroup (equivalently, as noted above, if &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;T&quot; permute) then &quot;QT&quot; = ⟨&quot;Q&quot; ∪ &quot;T&quot;⟩ = &quot;Q&quot; ∨ &quot;T&quot;; i.e., &quot;QT&quot; is the join of &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;T&quot; in the lattice of subgroups of &quot;G&quot;, and the modular law for such a pair may also be written as &quot;Q&quot; ∨ (&quot;S&quot; ∩ &quot;T&quot;) = &quot;S&quot; ∩ (&quot;Q ∨ T&quot;), which is the equation that defines a modular lattice if it holds for any three elements of the lattice with &quot;Q&quot; ≤ &quot;S&quot;. In particular, since normal subgroups permute with each other, they form a modular sublattice.

A group in which every subgroup permutes is called an Iwasawa group. The subgroup lattice of an Iwasawa group is thus a modular lattice, so these groups are sometimes called &quot;modular groups&quot; (although this latter term may have other meanings.)

The assumption in the modular law for groups (as formulated above) that &quot;Q&quot; is a subgroup of &quot;S&quot; is essential. If &quot;Q&quot; is &quot;not&quot; a subgroup of &quot;S&quot;, then the tentative, more general distributive property that one may consider &quot;S&quot; ∩ (&quot;QT&quot;) = (&quot;S&quot; ∩ &quot;Q&quot;)(&quot;S&quot; ∩ &quot;T&quot;) is &quot;false&quot;.

=== Product of subgroups with trivial intersection ===
In particular, if &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; intersect only in the identity, then every element of &quot;ST&quot; has a unique expression as a product &quot;st&quot; with &quot;s&quot; in &quot;S&quot; and &quot;t&quot; in &quot;T&quot;. If &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; also commute, then &quot;ST&quot; is a group, and is called a Zappa–Szép product. Even further, if &quot;S&quot; or &quot;T&quot; is normal in &quot;ST&quot;, then &quot;ST&quot; coincides with the semidirect product of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;. Finally, if both &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are normal in &quot;ST&quot;, then &quot;ST&quot; coincides with the direct product of &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot;.

If &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are subgroups whose intersection is the trivial subgroup (identity element) and additionally &quot;ST&quot; = &quot;G&quot;, then &quot;S&quot; is called a complement of &quot;T&quot; and vice versa.

By a (locally unambiguous) abuse of terminology, two subgroups that intersect only on the (otherwise obligatory) identity are sometimes called disjoint.

=== Product of subgroups with non-trivial intersection ===
A question that arises in the case of a non-trivial intersection between a normal subgroup &quot;N&quot; and a subgroup &quot;K&quot; is what is the structure of the quotient &quot;NK&quot;/&quot;N&quot;. Although one might be tempted to just &quot;cancel out&quot; &quot;N&quot; and say the answer is &quot;K&quot;, that is not correct because a homomorphism with kernel &quot;N&quot; will also &quot;collapse&quot; (map to 1) all elements of &quot;K&quot; that happen to be in &quot;N&quot;. Thus the correct answer is that &quot;NK&quot;/&quot;N&quot; is isomorphic with &quot;K&quot;/(&quot;N&quot;∩&quot;K&quot;). This fact is sometimes called the second isomorphism theorem, (although the numbering of these theorems sees some variation between authors); it has also been called the &quot;diamond theorem&quot; by I. Martin Isaacs because of the shape of subgroup lattice involved, and has also been called the &quot;parallelogram rule&quot; by Paul Moritz Cohn, who thus emphasized analogy with the parallelogram rule for vectors because in the resulting subgroup lattice the two sides assumed to represent the quotient groups (&quot;SN&quot;) / &quot;N&quot; and &quot;S&quot; / (&quot;S&quot; ∩ &quot;N&quot;) are &quot;equal&quot; in the sense of isomorphism.

Frattini&#x27;s argument guarantees the existence of a product of subgroups (giving rise to the whole group) in a case where the intersection is not necessarily trivial (and for this latter reason the two subgroups are not complements). More specifically, if &quot;G&quot; is a finite group with normal subgroup &quot;N&quot;, and if &quot;P&quot; is a Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup of &quot;N&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; = &quot;N&quot;&quot;G&quot;(&quot;P&quot;)&quot;N&quot;, where &quot;N&quot;&quot;G&quot;(&quot;P&quot;) denotes the normalizer of &quot;P&quot; in &quot;G&quot;. (Note that the normalizer of &quot;P&quot; includes &quot;P&quot;, so the intersection between &quot;N&quot; and &quot;N&quot;&quot;G&quot;(&quot;P&quot;) is at least &quot;P&quot;.)

==Generalization to semigroups==
In a semigroup S, the product of two subsets defines a structure of a semigroup on P(S), the power set of the semigroup S; furthermore P(S) is a semiring with addition as union (of subsets) and multiplication as product of subsets.

<doc id="24739" wikidata="Q410234" url="?curid=24739" title="Piperidine">
<text>Piperidine is an organic compound with the molecular formula (CH2)5NH. This heterocyclic amine consists of a six-membered ring containing five methylene bridges (–CH2–) and one amine bridge (–NH–). It is a colorless liquid with an odor described as objectionable, typical of amines. The name comes from the genus name &quot;Piper&quot;, which is the Latin word for pepper. Although piperidine is a common organic compound, it is best known as a representative structure element within many pharmaceuticals and alkaloids, such as natural-occurring solenopsins.

== Production ==
Piperidine was first reported in 1850 by the Scottish chemist Thomas Anderson and again, independently, in 1852 by the French chemist Auguste Cahours, who named it. Both of them obtained piperidine by reacting piperine with nitric acid.

Industrially, piperidine is produced by the hydrogenation of pyridine, usually over a molybdenum disulfide catalyst:
: C5H5N + 3 H2 → C5H10NH

Pyridine can also be reduced to piperidine via a modified Birch reduction using sodium in ethanol.

== Natural occurrence of piperidine and derivatives ==
Piperidine itself has been obtained from black pepper, from &quot;Psilocaulon absimile&quot; (Aizoaceae), and in &quot;Petrosimonia monandra&quot;.

The piperidine structural motif is present in numerous natural alkaloids. These include piperine, which gives black pepper its spicy taste. This gave the compound its name. Other examples are the fire ant toxin solenopsin, the nicotine analog anabasine of tree tobacco (&quot;Nicotiana glauca&quot;), lobeline of Indian tobacco, and the toxic alkaloid coniine from poison hemlock, which was used to put Socrates to death.

== Conformation ==
Piperidine prefers a chair conformation, similar to cyclohexane. Unlike cyclohexane, piperidine has two distinguishable chair conformations: one with the N–H bond in an axial position, and the other in an equatorial position. After much controversy during the 1950s–1970s, the equatorial conformation was found to be more stable by 0.72 kcal/mol in the gas phase. In nonpolar solvents, a range between 0.2 and 0.6 kcal/mol has been estimated, but in polar solvents the axial conformer may be more stable. The two conformers interconvert rapidly through nitrogen inversion; the free energy activation barrier for this process, estimated at 6.1 kcal/mol, is substantially lower than the 10.4 kcal/mol for ring inversion. In the case of &quot;N&quot;-methylpiperidine, the equatorial conformation is preferred by 3.16 kcal/mol, which is much larger than the preference in methylcyclohexane, 1.74 kcal/mol.

== Reactions ==
Piperidine is widely used to convert ketones to enamines. Enamines derived from piperidine are substrates in the Stork enamine alkylation reaction.

Upon treatment with calcium hypochlorite, piperidine converts to N-chloropiperidine, a chloramine with the formula C5H10NCl. The resulting chloramine undergoes dehydrohalogenation to afford the cyclic imine.

== NMR chemical control==
*13C NMR: (CDCl3, ppm) 47, 27.2, 25.2
*1H NMR: (CDCl3, ppm) 2.79, 2.19, 1.51

== Uses ==
Piperidine is used as a solvent and as a base. The same is true for certain derivatives: &quot;N&quot;-formylpiperidine is a polar aprotic solvent with better hydrocarbon solubility than other amide solvents, and 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine is a highly sterically hindered base, useful because of its low nucleophilicity and high solubility in organic solvents.

A significant industrial application of piperidine is for the production of dipiperidinyl dithiuram tetrasulfide, which is used as an accelerator of the sulfur vulcanization of rubber.

==List of piperidine medications==

Piperidine and its derivatives are ubiquitous building blocks in pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. The piperidine structure is found in, for example:
* Icaridin (Insect repellent)
*SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors)
**Paroxetine
*Stimulants and nootropics:
**Methylphenidate
**Ethylphenidate
**Pipradrol
**Desoxypipradrol
*Histamine 1 (H1) receptor antagonists/inverse agonists:
**Loratadine
* Histamine 3 (H3) receptor antagonists/inverse agonists:
**Pitolisant
*SERM (selective estrogen receptor modulators)
**Raloxifene
*Vasodilators
**Minoxidil
*Antipsychotic medications:
**Droperidol
**Haloperidol
**Melperone
**Mesoridazine
**Risperidone
**Thioridazine
*Opioids:
**Dipipanone
**Fentanyl and analogs
**Loperamide
**Pethidine (meperidine)
**Prodine
*Arylcyclohexylamines:
**PCP and analogs
*anticholinergic chemical weapons
**Ditran
**&quot;N&quot;-Methyl-3-piperidyl benzilate (JB-336, BZ)
Piperidine is also commonly used in chemical degradation reactions, such as the sequencing of DNA in the cleavage of particular modified nucleotides. Piperidine is also commonly used as a base for the deprotection of Fmoc-amino acids used in solid-phase peptide synthesis.

Piperidine is listed as a Table II precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances due to its use (peaking in the 1970s) in the clandestine manufacture of phencyclidine.

<doc id="24740" wikidata="Q2823570" url="?curid=24740" title="Political question">
<text>In United States constitutional law, the political question doctrine holds that a constitutional dispute that requires knowledge of a non-legal character or the use of techniques not suitable for a court or explicitly assigned by the Constitution to the U.S. Congress, or the President of the United States, lies within the political, rather than the legal, realm to solve, and judges customarily refuse to address such matters. The idea of a political question is closely linked to the concept of justiciability, as it comes down to a question of whether or not the court system is an appropriate forum in which to hear the case. This is because the court system only has the authority to hear and decide a legal question, not a political one. Legal questions are deemed to be justiciable, while political questions are nonjusticiable. One scholar explained:

A ruling of nonjusticiability, in the end, prevents the issue that brought the case before the court from being resolved in a court of law. In the typical case where there is a finding of nonjusticiability due to the political question doctrine, the issue presented before the court is either so specific that the Constitution gives sole power to one of the political branches, or the issue presented is so vague that the Constitution does not even consider it. A court can only decide issues based on the law. The Constitution dictates the different legal responsibilities of each respective branch of government. If there is an issue where the court does not have the Constitution as a guide, there are no legal criteria to use. When there are no specific constitutional duties involved, the issue is to be decided through the democratic process. The court will not engage in political disputes.

==Origin==
The doctrine has its roots in the historic original Supreme Court case of &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; (1803). In that case, Chief Justice John Marshall drew a distinction between two different functions of the U.S. Secretary of State. Marshall stated that when the Secretary of State was performing a purely discretionary matter, such as advising the President on matters of policy, he was not held to any legally identifiable standards. Therefore, some 
of the Secretary&#x27;s actions are unable to be reviewed by a court of law. Marshall argued that Courts should generally not hear cases where political questions were involved and &quot;individual rights were not implicated&quot; (later versions of the political question doctrine argued that it applied even if individual rights were at stake).

==Doctrine==
Unlike the rules of standing, ripeness, and mootness, when the political question doctrine applies, a particular question is beyond judicial competence no matter who raises it, how immediate the interests it affects, or how burning the controversy. The doctrine is grounded in the principle of separation of powers, as well as the federal judiciary&#x27;s desire to avoid inserting itself into conflicts between branches of the federal government. It is justified by the notion that there exist some questions best resolved through the political process, in which voters can approve or correct the challenged action by voting for or against those involved in the decision, or simply beyond judicial capability.

The leading Supreme Court case in the area of the political question doctrine is &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot; (1962). In that case, the Supreme Court held that an unequal apportionment of a state legislature may have denied equal protection and presented a justiciable issue. In the &quot;Baker&quot; opinion, the Court outlined six characteristics &quot;[p]rominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question&quot;:

*&quot;a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or 
*a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or 
*the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or 
*the impossibility of a court&#x27;s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or 
*an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or 
*the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.&quot;

The first factor—a textually demonstrable commitment to another branch—is the classical view that the Court must decide all cases and issues before it unless, as a matter of constitutional interpretation, the Constitution itself has committed the determination of the issue to another branch of government. The second and third factors—lack of judicially discoverable standards and involvement of the judiciary in nonjudicial policy determinations—suggest a functional approach, based on practical considerations of how government ought to work. The final three factors—lack of respect for other branches, need for adherence to a political decision already made, and possibility of embarrassment—are based on the Court&#x27;s prudential consideration against overexertion or aggrandizement.

==Other applications==
While the scope of the political question doctrine is still unsettled, its application has been mostly settled in a few decided areas. These areas are:

=== Guarantee Clause ===
The Guarantee Clause, Article IV, Section 4, requires the federal government to &quot;guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government&quot;. The Supreme Court has ruled that this clause does not imply any set of &quot;judicially manageable standards which a court could utilize independently in order to identify a State&#x27;s lawful government&quot;. On this ground, the Court refused in &quot;Luther v. Borden&quot; to decide which group was the legitimate government of Rhode Island. Since then, the Court has consistently refused to resort to the Guarantee Clause as a constitutional source for invalidating state action, such as whether it is lawful for states to adopt laws through referendums.

=== Impeachment ===
Article I, section 2 of the Constitution states that the House &quot;shall have the sole power of Impeachment&quot;, and Article I, section 3 provides that the &quot;Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments&quot;. Since the Constitution placed the sole power of impeachment in two political bodies, it is qualified as a political question. As a result, neither the decision of the House to impeach, nor of the Senate to remove a President or any other official, can be appealed to any court.

===Foreign policy and war===
A court will not usually decide if a treaty has been terminated because, on that issue, &quot;governmental action ... must be regarded as of controlling importance&quot;. However, courts sometimes do rule on the issue. One example of this is native American tribes who have been officially terminated do not lose their treaty concessions without explicit text from Congress that the treaty is also abrogated.

In the case of &quot;bin Ali Jaber v. United States&quot; (2017), the plaintiffs filed a lawsuit under the Torture Victim Protection Act of 1991 after a 2012 U.S. drone strike killed five civilians. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals dismissed the plaintiffs&#x27; claims on the basis that the &quot;plaintiffs challenged the type of executive decision found nonjusticiable in &quot;El-Shifa Pharmaceutical Industries Co. v. United States&quot; (2010).&quot; In &quot;El-Shifa&quot;, the court distinguished &quot;between claims questioning the wisdom of military action, &#x27;a policy choice . . . constitutionally committed&#x27; to the political branches, and &#x27;legal issues such as whether the government had legal authority to act.&#x27;&quot; Thus, the court held that the plaintiffs&#x27; argument required the court to make a policy decision.

=== Gerrymandering ===
There have been multiple cases on the justiciability of gerrymandering:
*In the case of &quot;Davis v. Bandemer&quot; (1986), the Supreme Court held that gerrymandering cases were justiciable under the Equal Protection Clause. The precedential power of this case is still unclear, especially considering the later case of &quot;Rucho v. Common Cause&quot;.
* &quot;Vieth v. Jubelirer&quot; (2004) held claims of partisan gerrymandering nonjusticiable because a discernible and manageable standard for adjudicating them had not been established or applied since &quot;Davis v. Bandemer&quot;. However, Justice Kennedy stated in his concurring opinion that judicially manageable standards for gerrymandering could be developed in future cases.
*&quot;Gill v. Whitford&quot; and &quot;Benisek v. Lamone&quot; (2017) were decided without taking a final stance on partisan gerrymandering. 
*&quot;Rucho v. Common Cause&quot; and &quot;Lamone v. Benisek&quot; (2019) were decided together on June 27, 2019, where a 5-4 majority concluded partisan gerrymandering was a political question and nonjusticiable by federal courts.

=== Private military contractors ===
In the case of &quot;Ghane v. Mid-South&quot; (January 16, 2014), the Mississippi Supreme Court held that a wrongful death action against a private military company by the family of a deceased United States Navy SEAL could proceed under Mississippi law since the plaintiff&#x27;s claims did not present a non-justiciable political question under &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot; (1962).

==Court cases==
Important cases discussing the political question doctrine:
*&quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot;, – the origin of the phrase.
* &quot;Luther v. Borden&quot;, – Guarantee of a republican form of government is a political question to be resolved by the President and the Congress.
* &quot;Coleman v. Miller&quot;, – Mode of amending federal Constitution is a political question.
* &quot;Colegrove v. Green&quot;, – Apportionment of Congressional districts is a political question (Overruled by &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot;).
* &quot;Baker v. Carr&quot;, – Apportionment of state legislatures is not a political question.
* &quot;Powell v. McCormack&quot;, – Congressional authority to exclude members who have met qualifications to serve is not a political question.
* &quot;Goldwater v. Carter&quot;, – Presidential authority to terminate treaties is a political question.
* &quot;INS v. Chadha&quot;, – Constitutionality of one house legislative veto is not a political question.
* &quot;Nixon v. United States&quot;, – Senate authority to try impeachments and impeachment are political questions.
* &quot;Corrie v. Caterpillar, Inc.&quot; (2007) – Foreign policy should be decided on by the executive branch of the government, not the judiciary. 
* &quot;Rucho v. Common Cause&quot;, (2019) – Partisan gerrymandering is a political question.

==Beyond the United States==
The political question doctrine has also had significance beyond American constitutional law.

=== France ===
A type of act by the French government, the &quot;acte de gouvernement&quot;, avoids judicial review as it is too politically sensitive. While the scope of the concept has been reduced over time, there are still acts that the courts do not have jurisdiction over, such as matters that are deemed to be unseverable from France&#x27;s diplomatic acts, like the President&#x27;s decision to conduct tests of nuclear weapons or to sever financial aid to Iraq. Other acts include the President&#x27;s decision to dissolve Parliament, award honors, or grant amnesty. Such &quot;actes de gouvernement&quot; need to be politically-based and also concern domains in which the courts are not competent to judge, e.g. national security and international relations.

=== Japan ===
The postwar constitution gave the Supreme Court of Japan the power of judicial review, and the court developed its own political question doctrine (; tōchikōi). The Supreme Court of Japan was in part trying to avoid deciding the merits of cases under Article 9 of the post-war pacifist constitution, which renounces war and the threat or use of force. Issues arising under Art. 9 include the legitimacy of Japan&#x27;s Self-Defense Force, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, and the stationing of U.S. Forces in Japan.

The &quot;Sunagawa case&quot; is considered the leading precedent on the political question doctrine in Japan. In 1957, in what was later known as the &quot;Sunagawa incident,&quot; demonstrators entered a then U.S. military base in the Tokyo suburb of Sunagawa. By their entry into the base, demonstrators violated a special Japanese criminal law based on the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. A Tokyo District Court found that the U.S. military&#x27;s presence in Japan were unconstitutional under Art. 9 of the Constitution and acquitted the defendants.

The Supreme Court overturned the district court in a fast-track appeal, implicitly developing the political question doctrine in the ruling. The Court found it inappropriate for the judiciary to judge the constitutionality of highly political matters like the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, unless they expressly violate the Constitution. On the Security Treaty, the Court saw &quot;an extremely high degree of political consideration&quot; and &quot;there is a certain element of incompatibility in the process of judicial determination of its constitutionality by a court of law which has as its mission the exercise of the purely judicial function.&quot; It therefore found that the question should be resolved by the Cabinet, the Diet, and ultimately by the people through elections. The presence of U.S. forces, moreover, did not violate Article 9 of the pacifist Constitution, because it did not involve forces under Japanese command.

Thereafter, the political question doctrine became a barrier for challenges under Art. 9. Under the &quot;clear mistake&quot; rule developed by the Court, it defers to the political branches on Art. 9 issues so long as the act is &quot;not obviously unconstitutional and void.&quot;

Other notable cases on the political question doctrine in Japan include the &quot;Tomabechi case&quot;, which concerned whether the dissolution of the Diet was valid. In the Tomabechi case, the Court also decided against judicial review by implicitly invoking the political question doctrine, citing the separation of powers as justification. In addition, the Court announced that in political question cases not related to Art. 9, the clear mistake rule does not apply and judicial review is categorically prohibited.

===Switzerland===
In 2007, Taiwan filed a lawsuit before a Swiss civil court against the International Organization for Standardization, arguing that the ISO&#x27;s use of the United Nations name &quot;Taiwan, Province of China&quot; rather than &quot;Republic of China (Taiwan)&quot; violated Taiwan&#x27;s name rights. On 9 September 2010, a panel of the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland decided, by three votes to two, to dismiss the suit as presenting a political question not subject to Swiss civil jurisdiction.

===Taiwan===
The Judicial Yuan on 26 November 1993 interpreted that the delimitation of national territory would be a significant political question beyond the reach of judicial review.

===International Court of Justice and European Court of Human Rights===

In international courts, the International Court of Justice has dealt with the doctrine in its advisory function, and the European Court of Human Rights has engaged with the doctrine through the margin of appreciation.

===Court of Justice of the European Union===
Within European Union law, the Court of Justice of the European Union has never explicitly addressed the political question doctrine in its jurisprudence, yet it has been argued that there are traces of the doctrine present in its rulings.
