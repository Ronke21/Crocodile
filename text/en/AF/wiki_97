<text>Syracuse ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Onondaga County, New York, United States. With a population of 148,620 and a metropolitan area of 662,057, it is the fifth-most populated city and 13th-most populated municipality in the state of New York.

Formally established in 1820, Syracuse was named after the classical Greek city Syracuse (&quot;Siracusa&quot; in Italian), a city on the eastern coast of the Italian island of Sicily, for its similar natural features. It has historically functioned as a major crossroads, first between the Erie Canal and its branch canals, then of the railway network. Today, the city is at the intersection of Interstates 81 and 90, and its airport is the largest in Central New York, a five-county region of over one million inhabitants.

Syracuse is the economic and educational hub of Central New York. It hosts a number of convention sites, including a large downtown convention complex, and is home to prominent institutions such as Syracuse University, SUNY Upstate Medical University, SUNY ESF, and Le Moyne College.

== History ==

French missionaries were the first Europeans to come to this area, arriving to work with and convert the Native Americans in the mid-17th century. At the invitation of the Onondaga Nation, one of the five nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, a Jesuit priest by the name of Simon Le Moyne, accompanied by soldiers and coureurs des bois, including Pierre Esprit Radisson, set up a mission, known as &quot;Ste. Marie de Gannentaha&quot;, on the northeast shore of Onondaga Lake.

Jesuit missionaries reported salty brine springs around the southern end of what they referred to as &quot;Salt Lake&quot;, known today as Onondaga Lake in honor of the historic tribe. French fur traders established trade throughout the New York area among the Iroquois. Dutch and English colonists also were traders, and the English nominally claimed the area, from their upstate base at Albany, New York. During the American Revolutionary War, the highly decentralized Iroquois divided into groups and bands that supported the British, and two tribes that supported the American-born rebels, or patriots.

Settlers came into central and western New York from eastern parts of the state and New England after the American Revolutionary War and various treaties with and land sales by Native American tribes. The subsequent designation of this area by the state of New York as the Onondaga Salt Springs Reservation provided the basis for commercial salt production. Such production took place from the late 1700s through the early 1900s. Brine from wells that tapped into halite (common salt) beds in the Salina shale near Tully, New York, 15 miles south of the city, was developed in the 19th century. It is the north-flowing brine from Tully that is the source of salt for the &quot;salty springs&quot; found along the shoreline of Onondaga Lake. The rapid development of this industry in the 18th and 19th centuries led to the nicknaming of this area as &quot;The Salt City&quot;.
The original settlement of Syracuse was a conglomeration of several small towns and villages and was not recognized with a post office by the United States Government. Establishing the post office was delayed because the settlement did not have a name. Joshua Forman wanted to name the village Corinth. When John Wilkinson applied for a post office in that name in 1820, it was denied because the same name was already in use in Saratoga County, New York. Having read a poetic description of Syracuse, Sicily (Siracusa), Wilkinson saw similarities to the lake and salt springs of this area, which had both &quot;salt and freshwater mingling together&quot;. On February 4, 1820, Wilkinson proposed the name &quot;Syracuse&quot; to a group of fellow townsmen; it became the name of the village and the new post office.

The first Solvay Process Company plant in the United States was erected on the southwestern shore of Onondaga Lake in 1884. The village was called Solvay to commemorate the inventor Ernest Solvay. In 1861, he developed the ammonia-soda process for the manufacture of soda ash (anhydrous sodium carbonate) from brine wells dug in the southern end of Tully valley (as a source of sodium chloride) and limestone (as a source of calcium carbonate). The process was an improvement over the earlier Leblanc process. The Syracuse Solvay plant was the incubator for a large chemical industry complex owned by Allied Signal in Syracuse. While this industry stimulated development and provided many jobs in Syracuse, it left Onondaga Lake as the most polluted in the nation.

The salt industry declined after the Civil War, but a new manufacturing industry arose in its place. Throughout the late 1800s and early 1900s, numerous businesses and stores were established, including the Franklin Automobile Company, which produced the first air-cooled engine in the world; the Century Motor Vehicle Company; the Smith Corona company; and the Craftsman Workshops, the center of Gustav Stickley&#x27;s handmade furniture empire.

On March 24, 1870, Syracuse University was founded. The State of New York granted the new university its own charter, independent of Genesee College, which had unsuccessfully tried to move to Syracuse the year before. The university was founded as coeducational. President Peck stated at the opening ceremonies, &quot;The conditions of admission shall be equal to all persons... There shall be no invidious discrimination here against woman... Brains and heart shall have a fair chance...&quot; Syracuse implemented this policy and attracted a high proportion of women students. In the College of Liberal Arts, the ratio between male and female students during the 19th century was approximately even. The College of Fine Arts was predominantly female, and a low ratio of women enrolled in the College of Medicine and the College of Law.

The first New York State Fair was held in Syracuse in 1841. Between 1842 and 1889, the Fair was held among 11 New York cities before finding a permanent home in Syracuse. It has been an annual event since then, except between 1942 and 1947, when the grounds were used as a military base during World War II, and in 2020, due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

As part of the racial incidents happening all over the country during the 1919 Red Summer, on July 31, 1919, there was a violent riot between white and black workers of the Syracuse Globe Malleable Iron Works.

Syracuse is home to the only &quot;green on top&quot; traffic light. The &quot;green on top&quot; traffic light was installed in 1928 as a result of local youths throwing rocks at the &quot;British red&quot; light that was originally on top. These locals became known as &quot;stonethrowers&quot; and the neighborhood now has the Tipperary Hill Heritage Memorial on the corner of Tompkins Street and Milton Avenue to commemorate this history.

World War II stimulated significant industrial expansion in the area: of specialty steel, fasteners, and custom machining. After the war, two of the Big Three automobile manufacturers (General Motors and Chrysler) had major operations in the area. Syracuse was also headquarters for Carrier Corporation, and Crouse-Hinds manufactured traffic signals in the city. General Electric, with its headquarters in Schenectady to the east, had its main television manufacturing plant at Electronics Parkway in Syracuse.

The manufacturing industry in Syracuse began to falter in the 1970s, as the industry restructured nationwide. Many small businesses failed during this time, which contributed to the already increasing unemployment rate. Rockwell International moved its factory outside New York state. General Electric moved its television manufacturing operations to Suffolk, Virginia, and later offshore to Asia. The Carrier Corporation moved its headquarters out of Syracuse, relocated its manufacturing operations out of state, and outsourced some of its production to Asian facilities. Although the city population has declined since 1950, the Syracuse metropolitan area population has remained fairly stable, growing by 2.5% since 1970. While this growth rate is greater than much of Upstate New York, it is far below the national average during that period.

The Syracuse Community Grid project is a 2023 highway teardown project taking place in Downtown Syracuse, with the goal of improving the city.

== Geography ==
Syracuse is located at (43.046899, −76.144423). It is located about east of Rochester, east of Buffalo, and west of the state capital, Albany. It is also the halfway point between New York City and Toronto, about from each, Toronto to the northwest and NYC to the southeast.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (2.15%) water.

The city developed at the northeast corner of the Finger Lakes region. The city has many neighborhoods that were originally independent villages, which joined the city over the years. Although the central part of Syracuse is flat, many of its neighborhoods are on small hills such as University Hill and Tipperary Hill. Land to the north of Syracuse is generally flat, while land to the south is hilly.

About 27% of Syracuse&#x27;s land area is covered by 890,000 trees — a higher percentage than in Albany, Rochester, or Buffalo. The Labor Day Storm of 1998 was a derecho that destroyed approximately 30,000 trees. The sugar maple accounts for 14.2% of Syracuse&#x27;s trees, followed by the Northern white cedar (9.8%) and the European buckthorn (6.8%). The most common street tree is the Norway maple (24.3%), followed by the honey locust (9.3%).

The densest tree cover in Syracuse is in the two Valley neighborhoods, where 46.6% of the land is covered by trees. The lowest tree cover percentage is found in the densely developed downtown, which has only 4.6% trees.

Syracuse&#x27;s main water source is Skaneateles Lake, one of the country&#x27;s cleanest lakes, located southwest of the city. Water from nearby Onondaga Lake is not potable due to industrial dumping that spanned many decades, leaving the lake heavily polluted. Incoming water is left unfiltered, and chlorine is added to prevent bacterial growth. Most of the environmental work to achieve lake cleanup was scheduled to be completed by 2016; however Honeywell, the company tasked with the cleanup, announced the project&#x27;s completion in late 2017. For periods of drought, there is also a backup line which uses water from Lake Ontario.

Onondaga Creek, a waterway that runs through downtown, flows northward through the city. The Onondaga Creekwalk borders this, connecting the Lakefront, Inner Harbor, Franklin Square and Armory Square neighborhoods. The creek continues through the Valley and ultimately to the Onondaga Nation. The creek is navigable, but it can be a challenge. Its channelized nature speeds up its flow, particularly in the spring, when it may be dangerous. After some youngsters drowned in the creek, some residential areas fenced-off the creek in their neighborhoods.

=== Neighborhoods ===

The City of Syracuse officially recognizes 26 neighborhoods within its boundaries. Some of these have small additional neighborhoods and districts inside of them. In addition, Syracuse also owns and operates Syracuse Hancock International Airport on the territory of four towns north of the city.

Syracuse&#x27;s neighborhoods reflect the historically ethnic and multicultural population. Traditionally, Irish, Polish and Ukrainian Americans settled on its west side (see Tipperary Hill); Jewish Americans on its east side; German and Italian Americans on the north side; and African-Americans on its south side. In recent years, large numbers of refugees from the Middle East have settled mainly on the north side as well.

=== Climate ===

Syracuse has a hot-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;), as mean July temperatures are just above the threshold needed for a hot-summer climate. The city is known for its high snowfall, on average; Syracuse receives the most annual average snow of any metropolitan area in the United States. Syracuse usually wins the Golden Snowball Award among Upstate cities. Its record seasonal (July 1 to June 30 of the following year) snowfall so far is during the winter of 1992–93, while the snowiest calendar month was January 2004, with accumulated. The high snowfall is a result of the city receiving both heavy snow from the lake effect of nearby Lake Ontario (of the Great Lakes) and nor&#x27;easter snow from storms driven from the Atlantic Ocean. Snow most often falls in small (about ), almost daily doses, over a period of several days. Larger snowfalls do occur occasionally, and even more so in the northern suburbs.

The Blizzard of 1993 was described as the Storm of the Century. Some fell on the city within 48 hours, with falling within the first 24 hours. Syracuse received more snow than any other city in the country during this storm, which shattered a total of eight local records, including the most snow in a single snowstorm. A second notable snowfall was the Blizzard of 1966, with . The Blizzard of &#x27;58 occurred in February (16–17th) across Oswego and Onondaga counties. This storm was classified as a blizzard due to the high winds, blowing snow, and cold; of snow was measured at Syracuse and drifts reached in Oswego County. (See Thirtieth Publication of the Oswego County Historical Society, (1969) and The Climate and Snow Climatology of Oswego N.Y., (1971) 

Syracuse on average receives an annual precipitation of , with the months of July through September being the wettest in terms of total precipitation, while precipitation occurs on more days each month during the snow season.

The normal monthly mean temperature ranges from in January to in July. The record high of was recorded on July 9, 1936, and the record low of has occurred three times since 1942, the last being February 18, 1979.

In the early 21st century, a handful of previous heat records have been broken in the city. For example, July 2020 became the hottest month on record, with a mean temperature of , while the summers (June–August) of 2005, 2020, and 2012 were, respectively, the hottest, third-hottest, and fourth-hottest summers on record. Additionally, 2017 and 2018 saw consecutive monthly high temperature records broken in February, of on February 24, 2017, and on February 21, 2018, in addition to four consecutive days at or above . The latter was the warmest winter day on record.

== Economy ==

Formerly a manufacturing center, Syracuse&#x27;s economy has faced challenges over the past decades as industrial jobs have left the area. The number of local and state government jobs also has been declining for several years. Syracuse&#x27;s top employers now are primarily in higher education, research, health care and services; some high-tech manufacturing remains. University Hill is Syracuse&#x27;s fastest-growing neighborhood, fueled by expansions by Syracuse University and Upstate Medical University (a division of the State University of New York), as well as dozens of small medical office complexes.

=== Micron Technology semiconductor mega-complex ===

Micron Technology plans to spend up to $100 billion building a mega-complex of computer chip plants in Syracuse&#x27;s northern suburbs, about a 15-minute drive from downtown Syracuse, in what would be the largest single private investment in New York history.

Micron Technology announced it will begin construction in 2024. Micron&#x27;s Clay mega-complex of memory chip fabs would create up to 9,000 direct jobs and additional 40,000 supply-chain and construction jobs over the next 20 years in Syracuse area. In Phase 1, the company will spend $20 billion to build its first plant, which it estimates will require about 5,000 workers for construction and initially employ about 3,000 manufacturing workers.

Micron&#x27;s Syracuse investment was influenced by passage of the CHIPS and Science Act. Through the CHIPs and Science Act, Congress and the Biden administration established a powerful investment platform with the potential to expand the region&#x27;s productive capacity for decades.

=== Colleges and universities ===
One of Syracuse&#x27;s major research universities is Syracuse University, located on University Hill. It had an enrollment of 22,484 for the 2017–2018 academic year.
Immediately adjacent to Syracuse University are two doctoral-degree granting universities, the SUNY Upstate Medical University and SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry. Both institutions have long-standing ties to Syracuse University. Upstate Medical University is also one of Syracuse&#x27;s major research universities and is one of only about 125 academic medical centers in the country. The medical university directly generates 10,959 jobs, making it Central New York&#x27;s largest employer. In addition, the Norton College of Medicine at SUNY Upstate is the only medical school in the Central New York region providing state of the art education to over 700+ students.

Also serving Syracuse are Le Moyne College on the city&#x27;s eastern border, and Onondaga Community College, which has its main campus in the adjacent Town of Onondaga and has two smaller campuses, downtown and in Liverpool. A branch of SUNY&#x27;s Empire State College is in downtown Syracuse, along with a campus of the nationwide Bryant &amp; Stratton College. There are also the Pomeroy College of Nursing at Crouse Hospital and St. Joseph&#x27;s College of Nursing.

Other colleges and universities in the area include Cornell University and Ithaca College in Ithaca, Hamilton College in Clinton, Oswego State College in Oswego, SUNY Cortland in Cortland, Morrisville State College in Morrisville, Colgate University in Hamilton, Cazenovia College in Cazenovia (closed 2023), Wells College in Aurora, and both Utica College and SUNY Institute of Technology in Utica.
== Parks and recreation ==

=== Current teams ===
===Collegiate teams===
Syracuse University sports are by far the most attended sporting events in the Syracuse area. Basketball games often draw over 30,000 fans, and football games over 40,000. The university has bred dozens of famous professional players since starting an athletics program in the late nineteenth century, including all-time greats Ernie Davis, Jim Brown, Larry Csonka and Dave Bing. Both teams play in the JMA Wireless Dome.

In addition to many former professional minor league teams, Syracuse was previously the home of several top-level pro teams, most notably the Syracuse Nationals who played a total of 17 seasons between the NBL and NBA, and won the 1955 NBA Finals before moving to Philadelphia and becoming the Philadelphia 76ers. Syracuse was also the home of two different Major League Baseball teams: the Syracuse Stars of the National League in 1879, which did not finish their first season; and the Syracuse Stars of the American Association in 1890.

== Government ==
=== Executive ===

The city is headed by an elected mayor who is limited to two four-year terms. Syracuse has a Strong mayor-council form of government. On November 7, 2017, Ben Walsh was elected mayor. He began in January 2018 as the first independent mayor of Syracuse in over 100 years. The last independent mayor of Syracuse was Louis Will, who was elected in 1913. The previous mayor was former Common Councilor at Large Stephanie Miner, who was elected on November 3, 2009; she was the first female mayor of Syracuse. Miner was preceded by former Syracuse Common Council President Matthew Driscoll, who first assumed the position in 2001 after the former mayor, Roy Bernardi, resigned upon his appointment by President George W. Bush to a position in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. After serving the remaining term, Driscoll was re-elected that year, and again in 2005.

=== Legislative ===
The legislative branch of Syracuse is the Syracuse Common Council. It consists of a president and nine members:

=== Judicial ===
The Onondaga County Supreme and County Court is the trial court of general jurisdiction for Syracuse. It is also the administrative court for the Fifth District of the New York State Unified Court System. Judges for these courts are elected at-large.

The U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York also holds court in downtown Syracuse at the James Hanley Federal Building.

=== Television ===

According to Nielsen Media Research, Syracuse is the fifth largest television market in New York State and the 87th largest in the United States (as of the 2020–2021 TV season). Six major full-power stations serve the city: WSTM-TV 3 (NBC), WTVH 5 (CBS), WSYR-TV 9 (ABC), WCNY-TV 24/cable 11 (PBS), WSPX-TV 56/cable 4 (Ion), and WSYT 68/cable 8 (Fox). WSTM-TV also operates the area&#x27;s CW affiliate on its DT2 subchannel and cable channel 6, and WSYT carries the MyNetworkTV affiliation on channel 43 and cable channel 7; both stations were previously separately-licensed stations before having their licenses returned to the FCC.

Additionally, networks such as Cornerstone Television channel 11 &amp; 22, Univision, and MTV2 are broadcast by low-power television stations.

Syracuse University&#x27;s student-run TV station is CitrusTV. CitrusTV programming is broadcast on the university campus on the Orange Television Network.

Syracuse&#x27;s cable television provider is Charter Spectrum (Charter Communications acquired Time Warner Cable in 2016), which, as a part of its regular and digital offerings, provides a 24-hour local news channel (Spectrum News Central New York), public access channel, and an additional PBS channel. Several suburbs also have access to Verizon Fios for cable television. Dish Network and DirecTV also provide local satellite television subscribers with local broadcast stations.

=== Newspapers ===
Syracuse has one major daily morning newspaper, &quot;The Post-Standard&quot;. Until 2001, Syracuse also had an evening paper, &quot;The Herald-Journal&quot;. It focuses on local news throughout Central New York, and has a reporter in Washington, DC.

Before the merger with the evening paper, the &quot;Post-Standard&quot; was named among the &quot;10 best newspapers in America with a circulation of under 100,000&quot; by Al Neuharth of &quot;USA Today&quot; (run by a competing organization). Since the merger, circulation has increased to over 120,000. Even outside of its four-county delivery area, the paper is available in many convenience stores and supermarkets from the Canada–US border to the New York–Pennsylvania border. The newspaper partly caters to this audience as well, covering many stories from the Ithaca, Utica, and Watertown areas. Since opening a new printing press in 2002, the paper calls itself &quot;America&#x27;s Most Colorful Newspaper,&quot; as almost every page contains color.

&quot;The Daily Orange&quot;, the newspaper of Syracuse University and SUNY ESF students, is read by over 20,000 people daily, and is widely distributed in the University Hill neighborhood and Armory Square. &quot;The Dolphin&quot;, the weekly student newspaper of Le Moyne College is also available, read mainly by Le Moyne students.

There are other popular free newspapers, including &quot;Eagle Newspaper&quot;&#x27;s downtown edition, the &quot;City Eagle&quot;, and &quot;Table Hopping&quot;, which focuses on the restaurant and entertainment scene. Additionally, a weekly newspaper, CNY Vision, publishes news and information focusing on Syracuse&#x27;s African American community.

A Hispanic-based monthly publication, called the CNY Latino newspaper, is published in Syracuse by the CNY Latino Media Consortium in both paper and online formats, and covers an area from Rochester to Albany and Watertown to Binghamton.

=== Magazines ===
The Syracuse area is covered in a regional lifestyle publication called &quot;The Good Life, Central New York Magazine&quot;, mostly known as &quot;Central New York Magazine&quot;. The magazine is bi-monthly (six issues per year) and offers print + digital and digital only subscriptions; it covers the greater Syracuse and Central New York area.

Central New York Magazine premiered in May 2006 and tells &quot;positive and uniquely CNY stories.&quot; Coverage areas include local shops and small businesses, regional travel destinations, food and drink, home décor, attractions and things to do, artisans, changemakers, and area trends.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===

==== Public transit ====
Syracuse is served by the Central New York Regional Transportation Authority, or Centro. Centro operates bus service in Syracuse and its suburbs, as well as to outlying metropolitan area cities such as Auburn, Fulton, and Oswego.

Proposed public transit projects

In 2005, local millionaire Tom McDonald proposed an aerial tramway system, called Salt City Aerial Transit (S.C.A.T.), to link the university to the transportation center. The first segment from Syracuse University to downtown was estimated to cost $5 million, which McDonald planned to raise himself. Due to perceived low operating costs, the system was envisioned as running continuously.

==== Rail ====
Syracuse (station stop code SYR) is served by Amtrak&#x27;s Empire Service, Lake Shore Limited, and Maple Leaf lines. Amtrak&#x27;s station is part of the William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center.

The Empire Service runs twice daily in each direction between Niagara Falls, NY and New York Penn Station, with major stops in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Utica, and Albany along the way. The Maple Leaf runs once daily in each direction, and follows the same route as the Empire Service, however instead of terminating in Niagara Falls, it continues on to Toronto.

Empire Service and Maple Leaf trains stop at the seasonal New York State Fair – NYF station during the New York State Fair&#x27;s annual run each August. The NYF Station is located along the southern part of the fairgrounds, near the historic train car display of the Central New York Chapter, of the National Railway Historical Society.

The Lake Shore Limited runs once daily in each direction between Chicago and Boston or New York City (via two sections splitting Albany-Rensselaer). It follows the same route as the Empire Service and Maple Leaf between New York City and Buffalo-Depew, where it diverges and continues on through Cleveland and Toledo to Chicago.

A regional commuter rail service, OnTrack, was active from 1994 until it was discontinued in 2007 due to low ridership. Its sole route connected the Carousel Center to southern Syracuse, often extending to Jamesville in the summer.

==== Bus ====
Greyhound Lines, Megabus, OurBus, and Trailways provide long-distance bus service to destinations including New York City, Boston, Buffalo, Albany, and Toronto. Greyhound, Megabus, and Trailways use the William F. Walsh Regional Transportation Center in the northern area of the city, while OurBus stops near the campus of Syracuse University.

==== Air service ====
Syracuse is served by the Syracuse Hancock International Airport in nearby Salina, near Mattydale. The airport is named after Clarence E. Hancock, a former US Congressman representing Syracuse. The airport is served by 8 major airlines, which provide non-stop flights to important airline hubs and business centers such as Atlanta, Boston, Charlotte, Chicago, Detroit, Denver, Ft. Lauderdale, New York City, Orlando, Philadelphia, Tampa, Washington, DC, as well as connecting service to 147 foreign cities in 87 countries. Cargo carriers FedEx and UPS also serve the airport. New York City can be reached in under an hour flight. The City of Syracuse owns the airport and property, while a public for-benefit corporation runs the airport, the Syracuse Regional Airport Authority. The airport is protected by the 174th Attack Wing&#x27;s Fire Department, and patrolled by Syracuse Airport Police Department Officers.

==== Major highways and roads ====
* Interstate 81 runs north–south through Syracuse, and provides access to Canada, Pennsylvania and points south. Its downtown portion is extremely narrow, only consisting of four lanes and few onramps. The highway was known as the Penn-Can Expressway when first built, leading to the Penn-Can Mall and other similarly named developments. It will soon be rerouted to follow I-481&#x27;s route around the city instead of going through downtown. The current route will be designated as Interstate 81 Business.
* Interstate 90, signed as the New York State Thruway within New York State, runs east–west, just north of the city. It is a toll highway that provides access to Rochester, Buffalo, Albany, and the north–south (Interstate 87) part of the Thruway leads to New York City.
* Interstate 690 runs east–west through the city, and provides access to Interstate 90, as well as to Syracuse&#x27;s northwestern and eastern suburbs. A spur off I-690 directly west of the city, NY 695, provides freeway access to the southwestern suburbs. It meets Interstate 81 in downtown Syracuse in a highly complex and incomplete intersection. Most of its routing through the city directly replaced the former elevated rail lines of the New York Central four-track mainline, a fact quite notable by the city&#x27;s former main rail terminal, where the freeway spans the width between the terminal and its outermost platform. In 1981, artist Duke Epolito erected sculptures of &quot;passengers&quot; on the single remaining passenger platform. The piece is entitled &quot;Waiting for the Night Train.&quot;
* Interstate 481 forms an eastern loop around the city and continues to the northwest as NY 481 to Fulton and Oswego, on the shore of Lake Ontario. The highway was built to provide rapid access to eastern suburbs after the affluent community members in Manlius and Fayetteville squashed the original design to extend Interstate 690 to serve the eastern suburbs. The highway is soon to be replaced in designation by Interstate 81.

Community Grid

In late May, 2023, The Community Grid project was officially approved for construction in the Syracuse. The highly controversial plan consists of removing the I-81 viaduct that runs through the downtown of the city, and replacing it with the Boulevard style Business Loop-81. The heavily congested Interstate-81 will be re-routed around the city onto the already existing Interstate-481. This project is estimated to cost around 2.25 billion dollars, and will be completed over a multi-year process. Construction has already begun in portions of North Syracuse at the I-81 and I-481 interchange.

Two US Highways run through the Syracuse area:

* U.S. Highway 11 (Route 223 in Quebec to New Orleans) runs north–south through Syracuse, including downtown, and it follows Salina, State, and Wolf Streets.
* U.S. Highway 20 (Boston to Newport, Oregon) passes south of Syracuse.

New York State Route Expressways:

* New York State Route 481 travels from NY 104 in Oswego to the terminus of Interstate 481 north of Syracuse.
* New York State Route 690 was built as an extension of Interstate 690 to serve the northwest suburbs of Syracuse. The route is a four-lane divided highway from its southern end at I-690, where it meets Interstate 90 (NYS Thruway), to its end northwest of Baldwinsville in Lysander at NY 48 and NY 631.
* New York State Route 695 is a short state highway west of Syracuse in the village of Solvay in Onondaga County. The number of the highway was derived from the two highways that NY 695 links, Interstate 690 and NY 5.

New York State Routes
* New York State Route 5 runs east–west through Syracuse, including downtown, and follows Erie Boulevard and West Genesee Street.
* New York State Route 80&#x27;s western terminus is at NY 175 on the south side. The route follows Valley Drive.
* New York State Route 92&#x27;s western terminus is in downtown Syracuse at US 11. The route follows East Genesee Street.
* New York State Route 173 runs east–west through Syracuse and follows the Seneca Turnpike through the South Valley neighborhood.
* New York State Route 175 follows South Avenue and West Kennedy Street to its eastern terminus at US 11.
* New York State Route 290&#x27;s western terminus is at US 11 just north of I-81. The route follows James Street.
* New York State Route 298&#x27;s western terminus is at exit 9 on I-690. The route follows Bear and Court Streets, Genant Drive and Sunset Avenue.
* New York State Route 370&#x27;s eastern terminus is at US 11 in the Lakefront neighborhood. The route follows Park Street.
* New York State Route 598 is a short north–south highway following Midler Avenue to its southern terminus at NY 5.

=== Public works ===
Public services such as garbage pickup, street plowing, sewage, and street and traffic maintenance are provided by the Department of Public Works (DPW).

=== Utilities ===
The Syracuse water system was one of the few water systems built and operated before federal funding. The water system was constructed mainly to support the industries around Syracuse, New York. Construction of Syracuse&#x27;s water system began in 1868. The water is brought in on a gravity fed system from Skaneateles Lake, through an unfiltered system, and carried into the city. It is noted for having some of the best drinking water in the nation, due to the quality of the lake.

In 2015, the city experienced an average of at least one water main break per day. Between 2005 and 2015, the city suffered 2,000 water main breaks. Mayor Stephanie Miner estimated of the cost to fix the city&#x27;s water infrastructure at $1 billion over a 10–15-year period. On February 25, 2015, Miner testified before a joint hearing of the state Assembly Ways and Means Committee and state Senate Finance Committee. Miner testified that the 2014 polar vortex contributed to the increase in Syracuse&#x27;s water main break.

On March 3, the 100th water main break in Syracuse in 2015 occurred on James Street. Early in 2015, Miner lobbied the state for funding to fix the city&#x27;s aging water system. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo declined to help, stating that the city should improve its economy and increase tax revenues, which would enable the city to fund their own water pipe repairs.

=== Police department ===
The Syracuse Police Department (SPD) is the principal law enforcement agency of the city of Syracuse, New York. For 2017–18, the police department budget was $48.5 million (equivalent to $ in ). Effective April 22, 2022, longtime Deputy Chief Joe Cecile is Chief of the SPD, following his predecessor Kenton Buckner&#x27;s retirement. Police headquarters is in the John C. Dillon Public Safety Building at 511 South State Street. The SPD is divided into three patrol zones North (Lakefront, Northside, Eastwood, Tip Hill), South West (Strathmore, Valley, Southside, Near-Westside), and Southeast (University Area, Downtown, Meadowbrook, Eastside).

In 2019, a jury awarded Elijah Johnson $35,000 () after he was beaten with unreasonable force by three police officers while being arrested. In addition, the city was forced to pay attorneys fees, at a total cost to taxpayers of $213,000.

==== Surveillance ====
Established in 2011, SPD operates a network of 521 surveillance cameras called the Criminal Observation and Protection System (COPS). Between 2011 and 2014 more than 40 utility pole mounted cameras were installed, mainly in the Southwest and Northeast neighborhoods. The cameras were funded by federal, state, and private grants. In Summer 2014, 10 cameras were approved for installation in Downtown Syracuse, the first area not targeted because of high levels of violent crime. Live monitoring of Clinton Square for suspicious people during events and festivals was planned, although police agreed to a prohibition on the use of cameras to monitor protests. Twenty-five additional cameras were planned to be installed in 2016.

In spring 2017, the surveillance system was augmented with the installation of ShotSpotter gunshot detection sensors. Syracuse Mayor Stephanie Miner cited increasing public acceptance of police cameras and lower technology costs as factors in the decision.

=== Fire department ===

The Syracuse Fire Department (SFD) has the responsibility of protecting the City of Syracuse from fires and other dangers. The department provides multiple services in addition to fire related calls: multi-county regional HAZ-MAT response, first response to medical and trauma calls, unmanned aerial vehicle (drone) capabilities, and teams experienced in high-angle rope, swift water, and confined space rescue operations. The Chief of Fire is Michael J. Monds. SFD headquarters is in the John C. Dillon Public Safety Building at 511 South State Street. The department has a Class 1 rating from the Insurance Services Office, which is the best rating obtainable. This rating has a direct effect on the fire insurance of properties within the city. The SFD operates out of 11 fire stations, organized into three districts (akin to battalions), located throughout the city. The SFD currently maintains nine engine companies (operating with nine corresponding &quot;mini&quot; units), five truck companies, one heavy rescue company, a manpower-squad company, and several special and support units. The department also provides Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting ARFF coverage and specialized fire, rescue, medical, and hazardous materials coverage to the Syracuse Hancock International Airport (station 4).

<doc id="28445" wikidata="Q213600" url="?curid=28445" title="Sleep apnea">
<text>Sleep apnea (sleep apnoea or sleep apnœa in British English) is a sleep-related breathing disorder in which repetitive pauses in breathing, periods of shallow breathing, or collapse of the upper airway during sleep results in poor ventilation and sleep disruption. Each pause in breathing can last for a few seconds to a few minutes and often occurs many times a night. A choking or snorting sound may occur as breathing resumes. Common symptoms include daytime sleepiness, snoring, and non restorative sleep despite adequate sleep time. Because the disorder disrupts normal sleep, those affected may experience sleepiness or feel tired during the day. It is often a chronic condition.

Sleep apnea may be categorized as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), in which breathing is interrupted by a blockage of air flow, central sleep apnea (CSA), in which regular unconscious breath simply stops, or a combination of the two. OSA is the most common form. OSA has four key contributors; these include a narrow, crowded, or collapsible upper airway, an ineffective pharyngeal dilator muscle function during sleep, airway narrowing during sleep, and unstable control of breathing (high loop gain). In CSA, the basic neurological controls for breathing rate malfunction and fail to give the signal to inhale, causing the individual to miss one or more cycles of breathing. If the pause in breathing is long enough, the percentage of oxygen in the circulation can drop to a lower than normal level (hypoxemia) and the concentration of carbon dioxide can build to a higher than normal level (hypercapnia). In turn, these conditions of hypoxia and hypercapnia will trigger &quot;additional&quot; effects on the body such as Cheyne-Stokes Respiration.

Some people with sleep apnea are unaware they have the condition. In many cases it is first observed by a family member. An in-lab sleep study overnight is the preferred method for diagnosing sleep apnea. In the case of OSA, the outcome that determines disease severity and guides the treatment plan is the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). This measurement is calculated from totaling all pauses in breathing and periods of shallow breathing lasting greater than 10 seconds and dividing the sum by total hours of recorded sleep. In contrast, for CSA the degree of respiratory effort, measured by esophageal pressure or displacement of the thoracic or abdominal cavity, is an important distinguishing factor between OSA and CSA.

A systemic disorder, sleep apnea is associated with a wide array of effects, including increased risk of car accidents, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, stroke, atrial fibrillation, insulin resistance, higher incidence of cancer, and neurodegeneration. Further research is being conducted on the potential of using biomarkers to understand which chronic diseases are associated with sleep apnea on an individual basis.

Treatment may include lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, breathing devices, and surgery. Effective lifestyle changes may include avoiding alcohol, losing weight, smoking cessation, and sleeping on one&#x27;s side. Breathing devices include the use of a CPAP machine. With proper use, CPAP improves outcomes. Evidence suggests that CPAP may improve sensitivity to insulin, blood pressure, and sleepiness. Long term compliance, however, is an issue with more than half of people not appropriately using the device. In 2017, only 15% of potential patients in developed countries used CPAP machines, while in developing countries well under 1% of potential patients used CPAP. Without treatment, sleep apnea may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, diabetes, heart failure, irregular heartbeat, obesity, and motor vehicle collisions.

OSA is a common sleep disorder. A large analysis in 2019 of the estimated prevalence of OSA found that OSA affects 936 million—1 billion people between the ages of 30–69 globally, or roughly every 1 in 10 people, and up to 30% of the elderly. Sleep apnea is somewhat more common in men than women, roughly a 2:1 ratio of men to women, and in general more people are likely to have it with older age and obesity. Other risk factors include being overweight, a family history of the condition, allergies, and enlarged tonsils.

==Signs and symptoms==
The typical screening process for sleep apnea involves asking patients about common symptoms such as snoring, witnessed pauses in breathing during sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. There is a wide range in presenting symptoms in patients with sleep apnea, from being asymptomatic to falling asleep while driving. Due to this wide range in clinical presentation, some people are not aware that they have sleep apnea and are either misdiagnosed or ignore the symptoms altogether. A current area requiring further study involves identifying different subtypes of sleep apnea based on patients who tend to present with different clusters or groupings of particular symptoms.

OSA may increase risk for driving accidents and work-related accidents due to sleep fragmentation from repeated arousals during sleep. If OSA is not treated it results in excessive daytime sleepiness and oxidative stress from the repeated drops in oxygen saturation, people are at increased risk of other systemic health problems, such as diabetes, hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Subtle manifestations of sleep apnea may include treatment refractory hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias and over time as the disease progresses, more obvious symptoms may become apparent. Due to the disruption in daytime cognitive state, behavioral effects may be present. These can include moodiness, belligerence, as well as a decrease in attentiveness and energy. These effects may become intractable, leading to depression.

==Risk factors==
Obstructive sleep apnea can affect people regardless of sex, race, or age. However, risk factors include:

* male sex
* obesity
* age over 40
* large neck circumference
* enlarged tonsils or tongue
* narrow upper jaw
* small lower jaw
* tongue fat/tongue scalloping
* a family history of sleep apnea
* endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism
* lifestyle habits such as smoking or drinking alcohol
Central sleep apnea is more often associated with any of the following risk factors:

* transition period from wakefulness to non-REM sleep
* older age
* heart failure
* atrial fibrillation
* stroke
* spinal cord injury

==Mechanism==
Obstructive sleep apnea

The causes of obstructive sleep apnea are complex and individualized, but typical risk factors include narrow pharyngeal anatomy and craniofacial structure. When anatomical risk factors are combined with non-anatomical contributors such as an ineffective pharyngeal dilator muscle function during sleep, unstable control of breathing (high loop gain), and premature awakening to mild airway narrowing, the severity of the OSA rapidly increases as more factors are present. When breathing is paused due to upper airway obstruction, carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream. Chemoreceptors in the bloodstream note the high carbon dioxide levels. The brain is signaled to awaken the person, which clears the airway and allows breathing to resume. Breathing normally will restore oxygen levels and the person will fall asleep again. This carbon dioxide build-up may be due to the decrease of output of the brainstem regulating the chest wall or pharyngeal muscles, which causes the pharynx to collapse. As a result, people with sleep apnea experience reduced or no slow-wave sleep and spend less time in REM sleep.

Central sleep apnea

There are two main mechanism that drive the disease process of CSA, sleep-related hypoventilation and post-hyperventilation hypocapnia. The most common cause of CSA is post-hyperventilation hypocapnia secondary to heart failure. This occurs because of brief failures of the ventilatory control system but normal alveolar ventilation. In contrast, sleep-related hypoventilation occurs when there is a malfunction of the brain&#x27;s drive to breathe. The underlying cause of the loss of the wakefulness drive to breathe encompasses a broad set of diseases from strokes to severe kyphoscoliosis.

== Complications ==
OSA is a serious medical condition with systemic effects; patients with untreated OSA have a greater mortality risk from cardiovascular disease than those undergoing appropriate treatment. Other complications include hypertension, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Daytime fatigue and sleepiness, a common symptom of sleep apnea, is also an important public health concern regarding transportation crashes caused by drowsiness. OSA may also be a risk factor of COVID-19. People with OSA have a higher risk of developing severe complications of COVID-19. 

Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and severe obstructive sleep apnea are connected because there is an increase in the protein beta-amyloid as well as white-matter damage. These are the main indicators of Alzheimer&#x27;s, which in this case comes from the lack of proper rest or poorer sleep efficiency resulting in neurodegeneration. Having sleep apnea in mid-life brings a higher likelihood of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s in older age, and if one has Alzheimer&#x27;s then one is also more likely to have sleep apnea. This is demonstrated by cases of sleep apnea even being misdiagnosed as dementia. With the use of treatment through CPAP, there is a reversible risk factor in terms of the amyloid proteins. This usually restores brain structure and cognitive impairment. Evidence continues to be found supporting there is an association between BMI and Alzheimer&#x27;s. There is also evidence of increased risk of developing Alzheimer&#x27;s for those with a higher BMI in women ages 70 and above. While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) wasn&#x27;t found to significantly improve cognitive performance, it was found to benefit other symptoms like depression, anxiety, etc.

==Diagnosis==

===Classification===
There are three types of sleep apnea. OSA accounts for 84%, CSA for 0.9%, and 15% of cases are mixed.

====Obstructive sleep apnea====


In a systematic review of published evidence, the United States Preventive Services Task Force in 2017 concluded that there was uncertainty about the accuracy or clinical utility of all potential screening tools for OSA, and recommended that evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for OSA in asymptomatic adults.

The diagnosis of OSA syndrome is made when the patient shows recurrent episodes of partial or complete collapse of the upper airway during sleep resulting in apneas or hypopneas, respectively. Criteria defining an apnea or a hypopnea vary. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) defines an apnea as a reduction in airflow of ≥ 90% lasting at least 10 seconds. A hypopnea is defined as a reduction in airflow of ≥ 30% lasting at least 10 seconds and associated with a ≥ 4% decrease in pulse oxygenation, or as a ≥ 30% reduction in airflow lasting at least 10 seconds and associated either with a ≥ 3% decrease in pulse oxygenation or with an arousal.

To define the severity of the condition, the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) or the Respiratory Disturbance Index (RDI) are used. While the AHI measures the mean number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep, the RDI adds to this measure the respiratory effort-related arousals (RERAs). The OSA syndrome is thus diagnosed if the AHI is &gt; 5 episodes per hour and results in daytime sleepiness and fatigue or when the RDI is ≥ 15 independently of the symptoms. According to the American Association of Sleep Medicine, daytime sleepiness is determined as mild, moderate and severe depending on its impact on social life. Daytime sleepiness can be assessed with the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), a self-reported questionnaire on the propensity to fall asleep or doze off during daytime. Screening tools for OSA itself comprise the STOP questionnaire, the Berlin questionnaire and the STOP-BANG questionnaire which has been reported as being a very powerful tool to detect OSA.

=== Criteria ===
According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, there are 4 types of criteria. The first one concerns sleep – excessive sleepiness, nonrestorative sleep, fatigue or insomnia symptoms. The second and third criteria are about respiration – waking with breath holding, gasping, or choking; snoring, breathing interruptions or both during sleep. The last criterion revolved around medical issues as hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, mood disorder or cognitive impairment. Two levels of severity are distinguished, the first one is determined by a polysomnography or home sleep apnea test demonstrating 5 or more predominantly obstructive respiratory events per hour of sleep and the higher levels are determined by 15 or more events. If the events are present less than 5 times per hour, no obstructive sleep apnea is diagnosed.

A considerable night-to-night variability further complicates diagnosis of OSA. In unclear cases, multiple nights of testing might be required to achieve an accurate diagnosis. Since sequential nights of testing would be impractical and cost prohibitive in the sleep lab, home sleep testing for multiple nights can not only be more useful, but more reflective of what is typically happening each night.

=== Polysomnography ===

Nighttime in-laboratory Level 1 polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard test for diagnosis. Patients are monitored with EEG leads, pulse oximetry, temperature and pressure sensors to detect nasal and oral airflow, respiratory impedance plethysmography or similar resistance belts around the chest and abdomen to detect motion, an ECG lead, and EMG sensors to detect muscle contraction in the chin, chest, and legs. A hypopnea can be based on one of two criteria. It can either be a reduction in airflow of at least 30% for more than 10 seconds associated with at least 4% oxygen desaturation or a reduction in airflow of at least 30% for more than 10 seconds associated with at least 3% oxygen desaturation or an arousal from sleep on EEG.

An &quot;event&quot; can be either an apnea, characterized by complete cessation of airflow for at least 10 seconds, or a hypopnea in which airflow decreases by 50 percent for 10 seconds or decreases by 30 percent if there is an associated decrease in the oxygen saturation or an arousal from sleep. To grade the severity of sleep apnea, the number of events per hour is reported as the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). An AHI of less than 5 is considered normal. An AHI of 5–15 is mild; 15–30 is moderate, and more than 30 events per hour characterizes severe sleep apnea.

=== Central sleep apnea ===

The diagnosis of CSA syndrome is made when the presence of at least 5 central apnea events occur per hour. There are multiple mechanisms that drive the apnea events. In individuals with heart failure with Cheyne-Stokes respiration, the brain&#x27;s respiratory control centers are imbalanced during sleep. This results in ventilatory instability, caused by chemoreceptors that are hyperresponsive to CO2 fluctuations in the blood, resulting in high respiratory drive that leads to apnea. Another common mechanism that causes CSA is the loss of the brain&#x27;s wakefulness drive to breathe.

CSA is organized into 6 individual syndromes: Cheyne-Stokes respiration, Complex sleep apnea, Primary CSA, High altitude periodic breathing, CSA from medication, CSA from comorbidity. Like in OSA, nocturnal polysomnography is the mainstay of diagnosis for CSA. The degree of respiratory effort, measured by esophageal pressure or displacement of the thoracic or abdominal cavity, is an important distinguishing factor between OSA and CSA.

====Mixed apnea====
Some people with sleep apnea have a combination of both types; its prevalence ranges from 0.56% to 18%. The condition, also called treatment-emergent central apnea, is generally detected when obstructive sleep apnea is treated with CPAP and central sleep apnea emerges. The exact mechanism of the loss of central respiratory drive during sleep in OSA is unknown but is most likely related to incorrect settings of the CPAP treatment and other medical conditions the person has.

==Management==
The treatment of obstructive sleep apnea is different than that of central sleep apnea. Treatment often starts with behavioral therapy and some people may be suggested to try a continuous positive airway pressure device. Many people are told to avoid alcohol, sleeping pills, and other sedatives, which can relax throat muscles, contributing to the collapse of the airway at night. The evidence supporting one treatment option compared to another for a particular person is not clear.

=== Changing sleep position ===
More than half of people with obstructive sleep apnea have some degree of positional obstructive sleep apnea, meaning that it gets worse when they sleep on their backs. Sleeping on their sides is an effective and cost-effective treatment for positional obstructive sleep apnea.

===Continuous positive airway pressure===

For moderate to severe sleep apnea, the most common treatment is the use of a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or automatic positive airway pressure (APAP) device. These splint the person&#x27;s airway open during sleep by means of pressurized air. The person typically wears a plastic facial mask, which is connected by a flexible tube to a small bedside CPAP machine.

Although CPAP therapy is effective in reducing apneas and less expensive than other treatments, some people find it uncomfortable. Some complain of feeling trapped, having chest discomfort, and skin or nose irritation. Other side effects may include dry mouth, dry nose, nosebleeds, sore lips and gums.

Whether or not it decreases the risk of death or heart disease is controversial with some reviews finding benefit and others not. This variation across studies might be driven by low rates of compliance—analyses of those who use CPAP for at least four hours a night suggests a decrease in cardiovascular events.

===Weight loss===
Excess body weight is thought to be an important cause of sleep apnea. People who are overweight have more tissues in the back of their throat which can restrict the airway, especially when sleeping. In weight loss studies of overweight individuals, those who lose weight show reduced apnea frequencies and improved apnoea–hypopnoea index (AHI). Weight loss effective enough to relieve obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) must be 25–30% of body weight. For some obese people, it can be difficult to achieve and maintain this result without bariatric surgery.

===Rapid palatal expansion===
In children, orthodontic treatment to expand the volume of the nasal airway, such as nonsurgical rapid palatal expansion is common. The procedure has been found to significantly decrease the AHI and lead to long-term resolution of clinical symptoms.

Since the palatal suture is fused in adults, regular RPE using tooth-borne expanders cannot be performed. Mini-implant assisted rapid palatal expansion (MARPE) has been recently developed as a non-surgical option for the transverse expansion of the maxilla in adults. This method increases the volume of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx, leading to increased airflow and reduced respiratory arousals during sleep. Changes are permanent with minimal complications.

===Surgery===
Several surgical procedures (sleep surgery) are used to treat sleep apnea, although they are normally a third line of treatment for those who reject or are not helped by CPAP treatment or dental appliances. Surgical treatment for obstructive sleep apnea needs to be individualized to address all anatomical areas of obstruction.

====Nasal obstruction====
Often, correction of the nasal passages needs to be performed in addition to correction of the oropharynx passage. Septoplasty and turbinate surgery may improve the nasal airway, but has been found to be ineffective at reducing respiratory arousals during sleep.

====Pharyngeal obstruction====
Tonsillectomy and uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP or UP3) are available to address pharyngeal obstruction.

The &quot;Pillar&quot; device is a treatment for snoring and obstructive sleep apnea; it is thin, narrow strips of polyester. Three strips are inserted into the roof of the mouth (the soft palate) using a modified syringe and local anesthetic, in order to stiffen the soft palate. This procedure addresses one of the most common causes of snoring and sleep apnea — vibration or collapse of the soft palate. It was approved by the FDA for snoring in 2002 and for obstructive sleep apnea in 2004. A 2013 meta-analysis found that &quot;the Pillar implant has a moderate effect on snoring and mild-to-moderate obstructive sleep apnea&quot; and that more studies with high level of evidence were needed to arrive at a definite conclusion; it also found that the polyester strips work their way out of the soft palate in about 10% of the people in whom they are implanted.

====Hypopharyngeal or base of tongue obstruction====
Base-of-tongue advancement by means of advancing the genial tubercle of the mandible, tongue suspension, or hyoid suspension (aka hyoid myotomy and suspension or hyoid advancement) may help with the lower pharynx.

Other surgery options may attempt to shrink or stiffen excess tissue in the mouth or throat, procedures done at either a doctor&#x27;s office or a hospital. Small shots or other treatments, sometimes in a series, are used for shrinkage, while the insertion of a small piece of stiff plastic is used in the case of surgery whose goal is to stiffen tissues.

====Multi-level surgery====
Maxillomandibular advancement (MMA) is considered the most effective surgery for people with sleep apnea, because it increases the posterior airway space (PAS). However, health professionals are often unsure as to who should be referred for surgery and when to do so: some factors in referral may include failed use of CPAP or device use; anatomy which favors rather than impedes surgery; or significant craniofacial abnormalities which hinder device use.

====Potential complications====
Several inpatient and outpatient procedures use sedation. Many drugs and agents used during surgery to relieve pain and to depress consciousness remain in the body at low amounts for hours or even days afterwards. In an individual with either central, obstructive or mixed sleep apnea, these low doses may be enough to cause life-threatening irregularities in breathing or collapses in a patient&#x27;s airways. Use of analgesics and sedatives in these patients postoperatively should therefore be minimized or avoided.

Surgery on the mouth and throat, as well as dental surgery and procedures, can result in postoperative swelling of the lining of the mouth and other areas that affect the airway. Even when the surgical procedure is designed to improve the airway, such as tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy or tongue reduction, swelling may negate some of the effects in the immediate postoperative period. Once the swelling resolves and the palate becomes tightened by postoperative scarring, however, the full benefit of the surgery may be noticed.

A person with sleep apnea undergoing any medical treatment must make sure their doctor and anesthetist are informed about the sleep apnea. Alternative and emergency procedures may be necessary to maintain the airway of sleep apnea patients.

===Other===

====Neurostimulation====
Diaphragm pacing, which involves the rhythmic application of electrical impulses to the diaphragm, has been used to treat central sleep apnea.

In April 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted pre-market approval for use of an upper airway stimulation system in people who cannot use a continuous positive airway pressure device. The Inspire Upper Airway Stimulation system is a hypoglossal nerve stimulator that senses respiration and applies mild electrical stimulation during inspiration, which pushes the tongue slightly forward to open the airway.

====Medications====
There is currently insufficient evidence to recommend any medication for OSA. This may result in part because people with sleep apnea have tended to be treated as a single group in clinical trials. Identifying specific physiological factors underlying sleep apnea makes it possible to test drugs specific to those causal factors: airway narrowing, impaired muscle activity, low arousal threshold for waking, and unstable breathing control.
Those who experience low waking thresholds may benefit from eszopiclone, a sedative typically used to treat insomnia. The antidepressant desipramine may stimulate upper airway muscles and lessen pharyngeal collapsibility in people who have limited muscle function in their airways.

There is limited evidence for medication, but 2012 AASM guidelines suggested that acetazolamide &quot;may be considered&quot; for the treatment of central sleep apnea; zolpidem and triazolam may also be considered for the treatment of central sleep apnea, but &quot;only if the patient does not have underlying risk factors for respiratory depression&quot;.
Low doses of oxygen are also used as a treatment for hypoxia but are discouraged due to side effects.

In December 2024, the FDA approved tirzepatide, an anti-diabetic and weight loss medication, as a component in the combination treatment of adults with obesity suffering from moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. Other components of the therapy are a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity.

====Oral appliances====
An oral appliance, often referred to as a mandibular advancement splint, is a custom-made mouthpiece that shifts the lower jaw forward and opens the bite slightly, opening up the airway. These devices can be fabricated by a general dentist. Oral appliance therapy (OAT) is usually successful in patients with mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. While CPAP is more effective for sleep apnea than oral appliances, oral appliances do improve sleepiness and quality of life and are often better tolerated than CPAP.

====Nasal EPAP====
Nasal EPAP is a bandage-like device placed over the nostrils that uses a person&#x27;s own breathing to create positive airway pressure to prevent obstructed breathing.

====Oral pressure therapy====
Oral pressure therapy uses a device that creates a vacuum in the mouth, pulling the soft palate tissue forward. It has been found useful in about 25 to 37% of people.

==Prognosis==
Death could occur from untreated OSA due to lack of oxygen to the body.

There is increasing evidence that sleep apnea may lead to liver function impairment, particularly fatty liver diseases (see steatosis).

It has been revealed that people with OSA show tissue loss in brain regions that help store memory, thus linking OSA with memory loss. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the scientists discovered that people with sleep apnea have mammillary bodies that are about 20% smaller, particularly on the left side. One of the key investigators hypothesized that repeated drops in oxygen lead to the brain injury.

The immediate effects of central sleep apnea on the body depend on how long the failure to breathe endures. At worst, central sleep apnea may cause sudden death. Short of death, drops in blood oxygen may trigger seizures, even in the absence of epilepsy. In people &quot;with&quot; epilepsy, the hypoxia caused by apnea may trigger seizures that had previously been well controlled by medications. In other words, a seizure disorder may become unstable in the presence of sleep apnea. In adults with coronary artery disease, a severe drop in blood oxygen level can cause angina, arrhythmias, or heart attacks (myocardial infarction). Longstanding recurrent episodes of apnea, over months and years, may cause an increase in carbon dioxide levels that can change the pH of the blood enough to cause a respiratory acidosis.

==Epidemiology==

The Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study estimated in 1993 that roughly one in every 15 Americans was affected by at least moderate sleep apnea. It also estimated that in middle-age as many as 9% of women and 24% of men were affected, undiagnosed and untreated.

The costs of untreated sleep apnea reach further than just health issues. It is estimated that in the U.S., the average untreated sleep apnea patient&#x27;s annual health care costs $1,336 more than an individual without sleep apnea. This may cause $3.4 billion/year in additional medical costs. Whether medical cost savings occur with treatment of sleep apnea remains to be determined.

== Frequency and population ==
Sleep disorders including sleep apnea have become an important health issue in the United States. Twenty-two million Americans have been estimated to have sleep apnea, with 80% of moderate and severe OSA cases undiagnosed.

OSA can occur at any age, but it happens more frequently in men who are over 40 and overweight.

==History==
A type of CSA was described in the German myth of Ondine&#x27;s curse where the person when asleep would forget to breathe. The clinical picture of this condition has long been recognized as a character trait, without an understanding of the disease process. The term &quot;Pickwickian syndrome&quot; that is sometimes used for the syndrome was coined by the famous early 20th-century physician William Osler, who must have been a reader of Charles Dickens. The description of Joe, &quot;the fat boy&quot; in Dickens&#x27;s novel &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;, is an accurate clinical picture of an adult with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.

The early reports of obstructive sleep apnea in the medical literature described individuals who were very severely affected, often presenting with severe hypoxemia, hypercapnia and congestive heart failure.

===Treatment===
The management of obstructive sleep apnea was improved with the introduction of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), first described in 1981 by Colin Sullivan and associates in Sydney, Australia. The first models were bulky and noisy, but the design was rapidly improved and by the late 1980s, CPAP was widely adopted. The availability of an effective treatment stimulated an aggressive search for affected individuals and led to the establishment of hundreds of specialized clinics dedicated to the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Though many types of sleep problems are recognized, the vast majority of patients attending these centers have sleep-disordered breathing. Sleep apnea awareness day is 18 April in recognition of Colin Sullivan.

<text>South African English (SAfE, SAfEn, SAE, en-ZA) is the set of English language dialects native to South Africans.

== History ==
British settlers first arrived in the South African region in 1795, when they established a military holding operation at the Cape Colony. The goal of this first endeavour was to gain control of a key Cape sea route, not to establish a permanent settler colony. Full control of the colony was wrested from the Batavian Republic following the Battle of Blaauwberg in 1806. The first major influx of English speakers arrived in 1820. About 5,000 British settlers, mostly rural or working class, settled in the Eastern Cape. Though the British were a minority colonist group (the Dutch had been in the region since 1652 when traders from the Dutch East India Company developed an outpost), the Cape Colony governor, Lord Charles Somerset, declared English an official language in 1822. To spread the influence of English in the colony, officials began to recruit British schoolmasters and Scottish clergy to occupy positions in the education and church systems. Another group of English speakers arrived from Britain in the 1840s and 1850s, along with the Natal settlers. These individuals were largely &quot;standard speakers&quot; like retired military personnel and aristocrats. A third wave of English settlers arrived between 1875 and 1904, and brought with them a diverse variety of English dialects. These last two waves did not have as large an influence on South African English (SAE), for &quot;the seeds of development were already sown in 1820&quot;. However, the Natal wave brought nostalgia for British customs and helped to define the idea of a &quot;standard&quot; variety that resembled Southern British English.

When the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, English and Dutch were the official state languages, although Afrikaans effectively replaced Dutch in 1925. After 1994, these two languages along with nine other Southern Bantu languages achieved equal official status.

SAE is an extraterritorial (ET) variety of English, or a language variety that has been transported outside its mainland home. More specifically, SAE is a Southern hemisphere ET originating from later English colonisation in the 18th and 19th centuries (Zimbabwean, Australian, and New Zealand English are also Southern hemisphere ET varieties). SAE resembles British English more closely than it does American English due to the close ties that South African colonies maintained with the mainland in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, the influence of American pop culture around the world made American English more familiar in South Africa, with some American lexical items becoming alternatives to comparable British terms.

== White South African English ==
Several white South African English varieties have emerged, accompanied by varying levels of perceived social prestige. Roger Lass describes white South African English as a system of three sub-varieties spoken primarily by White South Africans, called &quot;The Great Trichotomy&quot; (a term first used to categorise Australian English varieties and subsequently applied to South African English). In this classification, the &quot;Cultivated&quot; variety closely approximates England&#x27;s standard Received Pronunciation and is associated with the upper class; the &quot;General&quot; variety is a social indicator of the middle class and is the common tongue; and the &quot;Broad&quot; variety is most associated with the working class, low socioeconomic status, and little education. These three sub-varieties, Cultivated, General, and Broad, have also sometimes been called &quot;Conservative SAE&quot;, &quot;Respectable SAE&quot;, and &quot;Extreme SAE&quot;, respectively. Broad White SAE closely approximates the second-language variety of (Afrikaans-speaking) Afrikaners called Afrikaans English. This variety has been stigmatised by middle- and upper-class SAE speakers (primarily those of British origin) and is considered a vernacular form of SAE.

=== Phonology ===

==== Vowels ====
* Allophonic variation in the vowel (from Wells&#x27; 1982 lexical sets). In some contexts, such as after , the KIT vowel is pronounced ; before tautosyllabic it is pronounced ; and in other contexts it is pronounced . This feature is not present in Conservative SAE, and may have resulted from a vocalic chain shift in White SAE. 
* Pronunciation of the vowel with the long monophthongal . In contrast, other Southern Hemisphere Englishes like Australian English and New Zealand English have diphthongised ().
* Back , with lip rounding in the broader dialects ( or ). This differs from Australian English and New Zealand English, which have central instead.
* The trap-bath split, as in New Zealand English and partially also Australian English. 
* is short, open, weakly rounded, and centralised, around . 
* is short, half-closed back and centralised, around . 
* tends to resemble the Received Pronunciation non-rhotic among Conservative SAE speakers, while the vowel is front, half-close, centralised in other varieties.

==== Consonants ====
* In Conservative and Respectable SAE, is the voiceless glottal fricative . In Extreme SAE, has a more breathy-voiced pronunciation, , likely as a result of a Dutch/Afrikaans substrate. is sometimes deleted in Extreme SAE where it is preserved in Conservative and Respectable SAE. For instance, when it occurs initially in stressed syllables in words like &quot;house&quot;, it is deleted in Extreme SAE.
* Conservative SAE is completely non-rhotic like Received Pronunciation, while Respectable SAE has sporadic moments of rhoticity. These rhotic moments generally occur in -final words. More frequent rhoticity is a marker of Extreme SAE. 
* Unaspirated voiceless plosives (like , , and ) in stressed word-initial environments.
* Yod-assimilation: &quot;tune&quot; and &quot;dune&quot; tend to be realised as and , instead of the Received Pronunciation and .

== Black South African English ==
Black South African English, or BSAE, is spoken by individuals whose first language is an indigenous African tongue. BSAE is considered a &quot;new&quot; English because it has emerged through the education system among second-language speakers in places where English is not the majority language. At least two sociolinguistic variants have been definitively studied on a post-creole continuum for the second-language Black South African English spoken by most Black South Africans: a high-end, prestigious &quot;acrolect&quot; and a more middle-ranging, mainstream &quot;mesolect&quot;. The &quot;basilect&quot; variety is less similar to the colonial language (natively-spoken English), while the &quot;mesolect&quot; is somewhat more so. Historically, BSAE has been considered a &quot;non-standard&quot; variety of English, inappropriate for formal contexts and influenced by indigenous African languages.

According to the Central Statistical Services, about seven million black people spoke English in South Africa. BSAE originated in the South African school system when the 1953 Bantu Education Act mandated the use of native African languages in the classroom. When this law was established, most of the native English-speaking teachers were removed from schools. This limited the exposure that black students received to standard varieties of English. As a result, the English spoken in black schools developed distinctive patterns of pronunciation and syntax, leading to the formation of BSAE. Some of these characteristic features can be linked to the mother tongues of the early BSAE speakers. The policy of mother tongue promotion in schools ultimately failed, and in 1979, the Department of Bantu Education allowed schools to choose their own language of instruction. English was largely the language of choice because it was viewed as a key tool of social and economic advancement. BSAE has contrasting pronunciation and organisation of vowels and consonants compared to the ones in standard English. For instance, &quot;it lacks the tense/lax contrast and central vowels in the mesolectal variety.&quot;

=== Classification ===
The difference between Black and White South Africans is based on their ethnic backgrounds, with them, as BSAE, being originally the first indigenous people that made a &quot;new&quot; English South Africa and developing speaking their tongue version of English and deciding not to speak South Africa&#x27;s native language of English, which is mostly exclusive for them due to it not being the majority language. In SAE it is primarily used for publicising the differences between British and other forms of tongue speaking for native speakers in various communities of South Africa.

The local native language of Black South African &quot;new&quot; English would lean more on the syllable side and would lean less on stress timing; due to this, the speech of the language would be affected by the length of vowel deduction in &quot;new&quot; English.

=== Phonology ===
BSAE emerged from the influence of local native languages on the British English variety often taught in South African schools. After dispersing BSAE has been seen as three distinct subvarieties: the basilect, mesolect, and acrolect. Not much has yet been studied on the subvarieties of BSAE, and the distinctions between them are not yet fully defined. However, there are some notable pronunciation differences in the mesolect and acrolect.

The vowels in BSAE can be realised as five key phonemes: /i/, pronounced in words like &quot;FLEECE&quot; or KIT, /u/ in &quot;FOOT&quot; or &quot;GOOSE&quot;, /ɛ/ in &quot;TRAP&quot;, &quot;DRESS&quot;, or &quot;NURSE&quot;, /ɔ/ in LOT or FORCE, and /a/ as in CAR. /i/ may occasionally be pronounced [ɪ] in the acrolectal variety, though there is no consistent change among speakers. One difference in the acrolect in comparison to the mesolect is that it often uses [ʌ] in place of [a].

In addition, many vowels that are normally diphthongs in most varieties are monophthongs in BSAE. For example, &quot;FACE&quot; in General White SAE is typically pronounced as /feɪs/, but in BSAE is typically pronounced /fɛs/.

=== Grammar ===
Black South African English analysis has not been researched or utilised enough due to its contrasting methods to Southern British norms. BSAE has contrasting pronunciation and organisation of vowels and consonants compared to the ones in more commonly used languages such as other varieties of English. Due to English being an official language of South Africa, dialects that have contrary methods in language and pronunciation to English become isolated from the speech in that area. For instance, &quot;it lacks the tense/lax contrast and central vowels in the mesolectal variety.&quot;

In Black South African English, the length of vowels is changeable, and vowel length can be understood as stress placement, with some deviation from Standard English. An example of this is in the word &quot;sevénty&quot;, which has primary stress on the penultimate, rather than the initial, syllable.

Additionally, BSAE differs from other forms of dialect by &quot;having shorter tone/information units and having lower pitch and decrease intensity as the sentence concludes.&quot;

Certain words such as &quot;maybe&quot; are used as conditional words that imply the result of something if a thing or event were to happen. Another distinctive trait of BSAE is the use of the word &quot;that&quot; as a complementizer. Furthermore, BSAE has a high frequency of the retention of question word order which is 0.86 per 1000 words.

Other findings show that the Cultural Linguistic explorations of World Englishes have been evaluating BSAE based on its cognitive sociolinguistic principles. It is a language that is still being studied due to its strong cultural and traditional ties to its mother tongues.

=== History ===
Historically, BSAE has been considered a &quot;non-standard&quot; variety of English, perceived as inappropriate for formal contexts, and influenced by indigenous African languages.

BSAE, or Black South African English, has its roots in European colonialism of the African continent in the 19th century. As a result of English being pushed by the colonizers of the region, the British, English became widespread in the South African region after it became necessary for indigenous African communities to use for success under the British. Much like in other colonies of the British, English became a necessity for advancement and economic security in the colony for indigenous Africans.

According to the Central Statistical Services, as of 1994, about seven million black people spoke English in South Africa. BSAE originated in the South African school system when the 1953 Bantu Education Act mandated the use of native African languages in the classroom. When this law was established, most of the native English-speaking teachers were removed from schools. This limited the exposure that black students received to standard varieties of English. As a result, the English spoken in black schools developed distinctive patterns of pronunciation and syntax, leading to the formation of BSAE. Some of these characteristic features can be linked to the mother tongues of the early BSAE speakers. The policy of mother tongue promotion in schools ultimately failed, and in 1979, the Department of Bantu Education allowed schools to choose their own language of instruction. English was largely the language of choice because it was viewed as a key tool of social and economic advancement.

=== Geography ===

South Africa occupies the southern area of Africa, its coastline stretching more than from the desert border within Namibia on the Atlantic (western) coast southwards around the tip of Africa and then northeast to the border with Mozambique on the Indian Ocean. The low-lying coastal zone is narrow for much of that distance, soon giving way to a mountainous escarpment (Great Escarpment) that separates the coast from the high inland plateau. In some places, notably the province of KwaZulu-Natal in the east, a greater distance separates the coast from the escarpment. Although much of the country is classified as semi-arid, it has considerable variation in climate as well as topography. The total land area is . It has the 23rd largest Exclusive Economic Zone of .

The South African Central Plateau only contains two major rivers: The Limpopo and The Orange (with its tributary, the Vaal). These rivers mainly flow across the central places in the east and west off the coast until they reach the Atlantic Ocean through the Namibian border.

== Indian South African English ==
Indian South African English (ISAE) is a sub-variety that developed among the descendants of Indian immigrants to South Africa. The Apartheid policy, in effect from 1948 to 1991, prevented Indian children from publicly interacting with people of English heritage. This separation caused an Indian variety to develop independently from white South African English, though with phonological and lexical features still fitting under the South African English umbrella. Indian South African English includes a &quot;basilect&quot;, &quot;mesolect&quot;, and &quot;acrolect&quot;. These terms describe varieties of a given language on a spectrum of similarity to the colonial version of that language: the &quot;acrolect&quot; being the most similar. Today, basilect speakers are generally older non-native speakers with little education; acrolect speakers closely resemble colonial native English speakers, with a few phonetic/syntactic exceptions; and mesolect speakers fall somewhere in-between. In recent decades, the dialect has come much closer to the standard language through the model taught in schools. The result is a variety of English which mixes features of Indian, South African, Standard British, creole, and foreign language learning Englishes in a unique and fascinating way.

ISAE resembles Indian English in some respects, possibly because the varieties contain speakers with shared mother tongues or because early English teachers were brought to South Africa from India, or both. Four prominent education-related lexical features shared by ISAE and Indian English are: &quot;tuition(s),&quot; which means &quot;extra lessons outside school that one pays for&quot; (i.e. &quot;tutoring&quot; in other varieties of English); &quot;further studies&quot;, which means &quot;higher education&quot;; &quot;alphabets&quot;, which means &quot;the alphabet, letters of the alphabet&quot;; and &quot;by-heart&quot;, which means &quot;to learn off by heart&quot;; these items show the influence of Indian English teachers in South Africa. Phonologically, ISAE also shares several similarities with Indian English, though certain common features are decreasing in the South African variety. For instance, consonant retroflexion in phonemes like /ḍ/ and strong aspiration in consonant production (common in North Indian English) are present in both varieties, but declining in ISAE. Syllable-timed rhythm, instead of stress-timed rhythm, is still a prominent feature in both varieties, especially in more colloquial sub-varieties.

== Coloured South African English ==
About 20% of all coloured people in South Africa speak English as a home language. They are primarily concentrated in the provinces of KwaZulu-Natal and northeastern parts of the Eastern Cape in the former Transkei with some transplants being found in Johannesburg.

Many people from these regions migrated to Durban and Pietermaritzburg, where the most Anglophone coloureds can be found.

Anglophone coloureds with European heritage have ancestry mostly from the British Isles, which, along with originating in regions with very few Afrikaans speaking people, contributed to English being the main language of the coloured people in the region.

The accent of Anglophone coloured people is influenced by their multiracial background, being descended from Europeans (British, German, and Afrikaners), blacks (Zulu and Xhosa), Indians (both Dravidian and Indo-Aryan) as well as other mixed people like St. Helenians, Mauritian Creoles and some Griquas. This has influenced the accent to be one of the most distinctive in Southern Africa.

=== Cape Flats English ===

A particular variety or sub-spectrum of South African English is Cape Flats English, originally and best associated with inner-city Cape Coloured speakers.

== Lexicon ==

=== History of SAE dictionaries ===
In 1913, Charles Pettman created the first South African English dictionary, entitled &quot;Africanderisms&quot;. This work sought to identify Afrikaans terms that were emerging in the English language in South Africa. In 1924, the Oxford University Press published its first version of a South African English dictionary, &quot;The South African Pocket Oxford Dictionary.&quot; Subsequent editions of this dictionary have tried to take a &quot;broad editorial approach&quot; in including vocabulary terms native to South Africa, though the extent of this inclusion has been contested. Rhodes University (South Africa) and Oxford University (Great Britain) worked together to produce the 1978 &quot;Dictionary of South African English,&quot; which adopted a more conservative approach in its inclusion of terms. This dictionary did include, for the first time, what the dictionary writers deemed &quot;the jargon of townships&quot;, or vocabulary terms found in Black journalism and literary circles. Dictionaries specialising in scientific jargon, such as the common names of South African plants, also emerged in the twentieth century. However, these works still often relied on Latin terminology and European pronunciation systems. , Rajend Mesthrie had produced the only available dictionary of South African Indian English.

=== Vocabulary ===
SAE includes lexical items borrowed from other South African languages. The following list provides a sample of some of these terms:

* &quot;braai&quot; (barbecue) from Afrikaans 
* &quot;impimpi&quot; (police informant) 
* &quot;indaba&quot; (conference; meeting) from Zulu 
* &quot;kwela-kwela&quot; (taxi or police pick-up van) 
* &quot;madumbies&quot; (a type of edible root) found in Natal 
* &quot;mama&quot; (term of address for a senior woman) 
* &quot;mbaqanga&quot; (type of music) 
* &quot;morabaraba&quot; (board game) 
* &quot;sgebengu&quot; (criminal) found in IsiXhosa and IsiZulu speaking areas
* &quot;skebereshe&quot; (a loose woman) found in Gauteng
* &quot;y&#x27;all&quot; (the contraction of &quot;you all&quot;) for second person plural pronouns in ISAE
* &quot;aweh&quot; (a greeting or in agreement)

==== British lexical items ====
SAE also contains several lexical items that demonstrate the British influence on this variety:

* &quot;arse&quot;, &quot;bum&quot; (ass)
* &quot;chemist&quot; (drugstore)
* &quot;dinner-jacket&quot; (tuxedo)
* &quot;dustbin&quot; (garbage can)
* &quot;petrol&quot; (gasoline)
* &quot;silencer&quot; (muffler)
* &quot;flat&quot; (apartment)

=== Expressions ===
A range of SAE expressions have been borrowed from other South African languages, or are uniquely used in this variety of English. Some common expressions include:

* The borrowed Afrikaans interjection &quot;ag,&quot; meaning &quot;oh!&quot;, as in, &quot;Ag, go away man&quot;! (Equivalent to German &quot;ach&quot;). SAE uses a number of discourse markers from Afrikaans in colloquial speech.
* The expression to &quot;come with,&quot; common especially among Afrikaans people, as in &quot;are they coming with?&quot; This is influenced by the Afrikaans phrase &quot;hulle kom saam&quot;, literally &quot;they come together&quot;, with &quot;saam&quot; being misinterpreted as &quot;with&quot;. In Afrikaans, &quot;saamkom&quot; is a separable verb, similar to &quot;meekomen&quot; in Dutch and &quot;mitkommen&quot; in German, which is translated into English as &quot;to come along&quot;. &quot;Come with?&quot; is also encountered in areas of the Upper Midwest of the United States, which had a large number of Scandinavian, Dutch and German immigrants, who, when speaking English, translated equivalent phrases directly from their own languages.
* The use of the &quot;strong obligative modal&quot; &quot;must&quot; as a synonym for the polite &quot;should/shall&quot;. &quot;Must&quot; has &quot;much less social impact&quot; in SAE than in other varieties.
* &quot;Now-now&quot;, as in &quot;I&#x27;ll do it now-now&quot;. Likely borrowed from the Afrikaans &quot;nou-nou&quot;, this expression describes a time later than that referenced in the phrase &quot;I&#x27;ll do it now&quot;.
* A large amount of slang comes from British origin, such as &quot;naff&quot; (boring, dull or plain), or &quot;China&quot; (mate, friend) from cockney rhyming slang.

== Demographics ==
The South African National Census of 2011 found a total of 4,892,623 speakers of English as a first language, making up 9.6% of the national population. The provinces with significant English-speaking populations were the Western Cape (20.2% of the provincial population), Gauteng (13.3%) and KwaZulu-Natal (13.2%).

English was found to be spoken across all of South Africa&#x27;s ethnic groups. A breakdown of English speakers according to the conventional racial classifications used by Statistics South Africa is described in the following table:

== Examples of South African accents ==

<text>Speech processing is the study of speech signals and the processing methods of signals. The signals are usually processed in a digital representation, so speech processing can be regarded as a special case of digital signal processing, applied to speech signals. Aspects of speech processing includes the acquisition, manipulation, storage, transfer and output of speech signals. Different speech processing tasks include speech recognition, speech synthesis, speaker diarization, speech enhancement, speaker recognition, etc.

== History ==
Early attempts at speech processing and recognition were primarily focused on understanding a handful of simple phonetic elements such as vowels. In 1952, three researchers at Bell Labs, Stephen. Balashek, R. Biddulph, and K. H. Davis, developed a system that could recognize digits spoken by a single speaker. Pioneering works in field of speech recognition using analysis of its spectrum were reported in the 1940s.

Linear predictive coding (LPC), a speech processing algorithm, was first proposed by Fumitada Itakura of Nagoya University and Shuzo Saito of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) in 1966. Further developments in LPC technology were made by Bishnu S. Atal and Manfred R. Schroeder at Bell Labs during the 1970s. LPC was the basis for voice-over-IP (VoIP) technology, as well as speech synthesizer chips, such as the Texas Instruments LPC Speech Chips used in the Speak &amp; Spell toys from 1978.

One of the first commercially available speech recognition products was Dragon Dictate, released in 1990. In 1992, technology developed by Lawrence Rabiner and others at Bell Labs was used by AT&amp;T in their Voice Recognition Call Processing service to route calls without a human operator. By this point, the vocabulary of these systems was larger than the average human vocabulary.

By the early 2000s, the dominant speech processing strategy started to shift away from Hidden Markov Models towards more modern neural networks and deep learning.

In 2012, Geoffrey Hinton and his team at the University of Toronto demonstrated that deep neural networks could significantly outperform traditional HMM-based systems on large vocabulary continuous speech recognition tasks. This breakthrough led to widespread adoption of deep learning techniques in the industry.

By the mid-2010s, companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple had integrated advanced speech recognition systems into their virtual assistants such as Google Assistant, Cortana, Alexa, and Siri. These systems utilized deep learning models to provide more natural and accurate voice interactions.

The development of Transformer-based models, like Google&#x27;s BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and OpenAI&#x27;s GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), further pushed the boundaries of natural language processing and speech recognition. These models enabled more context-aware and semantically rich understanding of speech. In recent years, end-to-end speech recognition models have gained popularity. These models simplify the speech recognition pipeline by directly converting audio input into text output, bypassing intermediate steps like feature extraction and acoustic modeling. This approach has streamlined the development process and improved performance.

== Techniques ==

=== Dynamic time warping ===
Dynamic time warping (DTW) is an algorithm for measuring similarity between two temporal sequences, which may vary in speed. In general, DTW is a method that calculates an optimal match between two given sequences (e.g. time series) with certain restriction and rules. The optimal match is denoted by the match that satisfies all the restrictions and the rules and that has the minimal cost, where the cost is computed as the sum of absolute differences, for each matched pair of indices, between their values.

=== Hidden Markov models ===
A hidden Markov model can be represented as the simplest dynamic Bayesian network. The goal of the algorithm is to estimate a hidden variable x(t) given a list of observations y(t). By applying the Markov property, the conditional probability distribution of the hidden variable &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) at time &quot;t&quot;, given the values of the hidden variable &quot;x&quot; at all times, depends &quot;only&quot; on the value of the hidden variable &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot; − 1). Similarly, the value of the observed variable &quot;y&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) only depends on the value of the hidden variable &quot;x&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) (both at time &quot;t&quot;).

=== Artificial neural networks ===
An artificial neural network (ANN) is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it. In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs.

===Phase-aware processing===
Phase is usually supposed to be random uniform variable and thus useless. This is due wrapping of phase: result of arctangent function is not continuous due to periodical jumps on formula_1. After phase unwrapping (see, Chapter 2.3; Instantaneous phase and frequency), it can be expressed as:
formula_2, where formula_3 is linear phase (formula_4 is temporal shift at each frame of analysis), formula_5 is phase contribution of the vocal tract and phase source.
Obtained phase estimations can be used for noise reduction: temporal smoothing of instantaneous phase and its derivatives by time (instantaneous frequency) and frequency (group delay), smoothing of phase across frequency. Joined amplitude and phase estimators can recover speech more accurately basing on assumption of von Mises distribution of phase.

<doc id="28450" wikidata="Q7838" url="?curid=28450" title="Swahili language">
<text>Swahili, also known by its local name , is a Bantu language originally spoken by the Swahili people, who are found primarily in Tanzania, Kenya, and Mozambique (along the East African coast and adjacent littoral islands). Estimates of the number of Swahili speakers, including both native and second-language speakers, vary widely. They generally range from 150 million to 200 million; with most of its native speakers residing in Tanzania and Kenya.

Swahili has a significant number of loanwords from other languages, mainly Arabic, as well as from Portuguese, English and German. Around 40% of Swahili vocabulary consists of Arabic loanwords, including the name of the language ( , a plural adjectival form of an Arabic word meaning &#x27;of the coasts&#x27;). The loanwords date from the era of contact between Arab traders and the Bantu inhabitants of the east coast of Africa, which was also the time period when Swahili emerged as a lingua franca in the region.

Due to concerted efforts by the government of Tanzania, Swahili is one of three official languages (the others being English and French) of the East African Community (EAC) countries, namely Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. It is the lingua franca of other areas in the African Great Lakes region and East and Southern Africa. Swahili is also one of the working languages of the African Union and of the Southern African Development Community. The East African Community created an institution called the &quot;East African Kiswahili Commission&quot; (EAKC) which began operations in 2015. The institution currently serves as the leading body for promoting the language in the East African region, as well as for coordinating its development and usage for regional integration and sustainable development. In recent years South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Ethiopia, and South Sudan have begun offering Swahili as a subject in schools or have developed plans to do so.

Shikomor (or Comorian), an official language in Comoros and also spoken in Mayotte (Shimaore), is closely related to Swahili and is sometimes considered a dialect of Swahili, although other authorities consider it a distinct language. In 2022, based on Swahili&#x27;s growth as a prominent international language, the United Nations declared Swahili Language Day as 7 July to commemorate the date that Julius Nyerere adopted Swahili as a unifying language for African independence struggles.

==Classification==
Swahili is a Bantu language of the Sabaki branch. In Guthrie&#x27;s geographic classification, Swahili is in Bantu zone G, whereas the other Sabaki languages are in zone E70, commonly under the name &quot;Nyika.&quot; Historical linguists consider the Arabic influence on Swahili to be significant, since it takes around 40% of its vocabulary directly from Arabic, and was initially spread along the East African coast.

==History==
===Etymology===
The word `Swahili&#x27; comes from an Arabic name for the area, meaning &quot;coasts&quot;:
===Origin===
The core of the Swahili language originates in Bantu languages of the coast of East Africa. Much of Swahili&#x27;s Bantu vocabulary has cognates in the Unguja, Pemba, and Mijikenda languages and, to a lesser extent, other East African Bantu languages. While opinions vary on the specifics, it has been historically purported that around 16–20% of the Swahili vocabulary is derived from loan words, the vast majority Arabic, but also other contributing languages, including Persian, Hindustani, Portuguese, and Malay.

Omani Arabic is the source of most Arabic loanwords in Swahili. In the text &quot;Early Swahili History Reconsidered&quot;. However, Thomas Spear noted that Swahili retains a large amount of grammar, vocabulary, and sounds inherited from the Sabaki language. In fact, while taking account of daily vocabulary, using lists of one hundred words, 72–91% were inherited from the Sabaki language (which is reported as a parent language) whereas 4–17% were loan words from other African languages. Only 2–8% were from non-African languages, and Arabic loan words constituted a fraction of that. According to other sources, around 40% of the Swahili vocabulary comes from Arabic. What also remained unconsidered was that a good number of the borrowed terms had Bantu equivalents. The preferred use of Arabic loan words is prevalent along the coast, where local people, in a cultural show of proximity to, or descent from Arab culture, would rather use loan words, whereas the people in the interior tend to use the Bantu equivalents. It was originally written in Arabic script.

The earliest known documents written in Swahili are letters written in Kilwa, Tanzania, in 1711 in the Arabic script that were sent to the Portuguese of Mozambique and their local allies. The original letters are preserved in the Historical Archives of Goa, India.

===Colonial period===
Various colonial powers that ruled on the coast of East Africa played a role in the growth and spread of Swahili. With the arrival of the Arabs in East Africa, they used Swahili as a language of trade as well as for teaching Islam to the local Bantu peoples. This resulted in Swahili first being written in the Arabic script. The later contact with the Portuguese resulted in the increase of vocabulary of the Swahili language. The language was formalised in an institutional level when the Germans took over after the Berlin conference. After seeing there was already a widespread language, the Germans formalised it as the official language to be used in schools. Thus schools in Swahili are called Shule (from German ) in government, trade and the court system. With the Germans controlling the major Swahili-speaking region in East Africa, they changed the alphabet system from Arabic to Latin. After the First World War, Britain took over German East Africa, where they found Swahili rooted in most areas, not just the coastal regions. The British decided to formalise it as the language to be used across the East African region (although in British East Africa [Kenya and Uganda] most areas used English and various Nilotic and other Bantu languages while Swahili was mostly restricted to the coast). In June 1928, an inter-territorial conference attended by representatives of Kenya, Tanganyika, Uganda, and Zanzibar took place in Mombasa. The Zanzibar dialect was chosen as standard Swahili for those areas, and the standard orthography for Swahili was adopted.

==Current status==

===Overview===
Estimates of the total number of first- and second-language Swahili speakers vary widely, from as low as 50 million to as high as 200 million, but generally range from 60 million to 150 million.

Swahili has become a second language spoken by tens of millions of people in the five African Great Lakes countries (Kenya, DRC, Rwanda, Uganda, and Tanzania), where it is an official or national language. It is also the first language for many people in Tanzania, especially in the coastal regions of Tanga, Pwani, Dar es Salaam, Mtwara and Lindi. In the inner regions of Tanzania, Swahili is spoken with an accent influenced by other local languages and dialects. There, it is a first language for most of the people who are born in the cities, whilst being spoken as a second language in rural areas. Swahili and closely related languages are spoken by relatively small numbers of people in Burundi, Comoros, Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Rwanda. The language was still understood in the southern ports of the Red Sea in the 20th century. The East African Community created an institution called the East African Kiswahili Commission (EAKC) which began operations in 2015. The institution currently serves as the leading body for promoting the language in the East African region, as well as for coordinating its development and usage for regional integration and sustainable development.

Swahili is among the first languages in Africa for which language technology applications have been developed. Arvi Hurskainen is one of the early developers. The applications include a spelling checker, part-of-speech tagging, language learning software, an analysed Swahili text corpus of 25 million words, an electronic dictionary, and machine translation between Swahili and English. The development of language technology also strengthens the position of Swahili as a modern medium of communication. Furthermore, Swahili Wikipedia is one of the few Wikipedias in an African language that features a substantial number of contributors and articles.

===Tanzania===
The widespread use of Swahili as a national language in Tanzania came after Tanganyika gained independence in 1961 and the government decided that it would be used as a language to unify the new nation. This saw the use of Swahili in all levels of government, trade, art as well as schools in which primary school children are taught in Swahili, before switching to English (medium of instruction) in secondary schools (although Swahili is still taught as an independent subject). After Tanganyika and Zanzibar unification in 1964, &quot;Taasisi ya Uchunguzi wa Kiswahili&quot; (TUKI, Institute of Swahili Research) was created from the Interterritorial Language Committee. In 1970 TUKI was merged with the University of Dar es Salaam, while &quot;Baraza la&quot; &quot;Kiswahili la Taifa&quot; (BAKITA) was formed. BAKITA is an organisation dedicated to the development and advocacy of Swahili as a means of national integration in Tanzania. Key activities mandated for the organisation include creating a healthy atmosphere for the development of Swahili, encouraging use of the language in government and business functions, coordinating activities of other organisations involved with Swahili, standardising the language. BAKITA vision are: &quot;1.To efficiently manage and coordinate the development and use of Kiswahili in Tanzania 2.To participate fully and effectively in promoting Swahili in East Africa, Africa and the entire world over&quot;. Although other bodies and agencies can propose new vocabularies, BAKITA is the only organisation that can approve its usage in the Swahili language. Tanzanians are highly credited for shaping the language to appear the way it is now.

===Kenya===
In Kenya, Kiswahili has been the national language since 1964 and is official since 2010. &quot;Chama cha Kiswahili cha Taifa&quot; (CHAKITA) was established in 1998 to research and promote Kiswahili language in Kenya. Kiswahili is a compulsory subject in all Kenyan primary and secondary schools.

===Congo===

Swahili is recognized as a national language in the Democratic Republic of The Congo and is widely spoken in the eastern regions. The local dialects of Swahili in Congo are known as Congo Swahili and differ considerably from Standard Swahili.

===Burundi===
In order to strengthen political ties with other East African Community nations, both Kiswahili and English have been taught in Burundian elementary schools since the academic year 2005/2006. Kiswahili is now used widely in Burundi but is not recognised as an official language; only French, Kirundi, and English have this distinction. Since 2013, Swahili has been included in the all Burundian education system.

===Uganda===
Uganda adopted Kiswahili as one of its official languages (alongside English) in 2022, and also made it compulsory across primary and secondary schools in the country.

===Somalia===
The Somali language is the national and primary first language of Somalia. The Swahili language is not widespread in Somalia and has no official status nationally or regionally. Dialects of Swahili are spoken by some ethnic minorities on the Bajuni islands in the form of Kibajuni on the southern tip of the country and in the town of Brava in the form of Chimwiini; both contain a significant amount of Somali and Italian loanwords. Standard Swahili is generally only spoken by Somali nationals who have resided in Kenya and subsequently returned to Somalia. Lastly, a closely related language Mushunguli (also known as Zigula, Zigua, or Chizigua) is spoken by some of the Somali Bantu ethnic minority mostly living in the Jubba Valley. It is classified as a Northeast Coast Bantu language as Swahili is and has some intelligibility with Swahili.

In 2024, Somalia joined the East African Community and its inclusion may facilitate the spread of the Swahili language in Somalia. Nevertheless, in Somalia, Swahili, as a foreign language, will have to compete with English; the primary global lingua franca, Arabic; the official second language of Somalia and a liturgical language for Muslims, as popular secondary or tertiary languages. Consequently, there is significant uncertainty regarding the adoption of the Swahili language in Somalia compared to the situation in most other EAC member states.

==Religious and political identity==
===Religion===
Swahili played a major role in spreading both Christianity and Islam in East Africa. From their arrival in East Africa, Arabs brought Islam and set up madrasas, where they used Swahili to teach Islam to the natives. As the Arab presence grew, more and more natives converted to Islam and were taught using the Swahili language.

From the arrival of Europeans in East Africa, Christianity was introduced to the region. While the Arabs were mostly based in the coastal areas, European missionaries went further inland spreading Christianity. As the first missionary posts in East Africa were in the coastal areas, missionaries picked up Swahili and used it to spread Christianity, since it contained many similarities with other indigenous languages in the region.

===Politics===
During the struggle for Tanganyika independence, the Tanganyika African National Union used Swahili as a language of mass organisation and political movement. This included publishing pamphlets and radio broadcasts to rally the people to fight for independence. After gaining independence, Swahili was adopted as the national language. To this day, Tanzanians carry a sense of pride when it comes to Swahili, especially when it is used to unite over 120 tribes across Tanzania. Swahili was used to strengthen solidarity within the nation, and remains to be a key identity of the Tanzanian people.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Standard Swahili has five vowel phonemes: , , , , and . According to Ellen Contini-Morava, vowels are never reduced, regardless of stress. However, according to Edgar Polomé, these five phonemes can vary in pronunciation. Polomé claims that , , , and are pronounced as such only in stressed syllables. In unstressed syllables, as well as before a prenasalized consonant, they are pronounced as , , , and . &quot;E&quot; is also commonly pronounced as mid-position after &quot;w&quot;. Polomé claims that is pronounced as such only after &quot;w&quot; and is pronounced as in other situations, especially after (&quot;y&quot;). &quot;A&quot; can be pronounced as in word-final position. Long vowels in Swahili are written as doubled vowels (for example, , &quot;sheep&quot;) due to a historical process in which became elided between the second last and last vowels of a word (for example, , &quot;sheep&quot; was originally &quot;kondolo&quot;, which survives in certain dialects). As a consequence, long vowels are not considered phonemic. A similar process exists in Zulu.

===Consonants===
Where not shown, the orthography is the same as IPA.

Some dialects of Swahili may also have the aspirated phonemes though they are unmarked in Swahili&#x27;s orthography. Multiple studies favour classifying prenasalization as consonant clusters, not as separate phonemes. Historically, nasalization has been lost before voiceless consonants, and subsequently the voiced consonants have devoiced, though they are still written &quot;mb, nd&quot; etc. The phoneme is realised as either a short trill or more commonly as a single tap by most speakers. exists in free variation with h, and is only distinguished by some speakers. In some Arabic loans (nouns, verbs, adjectives), emphasis or intensity is expressed by reproducing the original emphatic consonants and the uvular , or lengthening a vowel, where aspiration would be used in inherited Bantu words.

==Orthography==

Swahili is now written in the Latin alphabet. There are a few digraphs for native sounds, &quot;ch&quot;, &quot;sh&quot;, &quot;ng″&quot; and &quot;ny&quot;; &quot;q&quot; and &quot;x&quot; are not used, &quot;c&quot; is not used apart from the digraph &quot;ch&quot;, unassimilated English loans and, occasionally, as a substitute for &quot;k&quot; in advertisements. There are also several digraphs for Arabic sounds, which many speakers outside of ethnic Swahili areas have trouble differentiating.

The language used to be primarily written in the Ajami script, which is an Arabic script. Much literature was produced in this script. With the introduction of Latin, the use of Ajami script has been diminished significantly. However, the language continues to have a tradition of being written in Arabic script. Starting from the later half of the 19th century, continuing into the 20th century, and going on in the 21st century, a process of &quot;Swahilization&quot; of the Arabic Script has been underway by Swahili scribes and scholars. The first of such attempts was done by Mwalimu Sikujua, a scholar and poet from Mombasa. However, the spread of a standardized indigenous variation of Arabic script for Swahili was hampered by the colonial takeover of East Africa by the United Kingdom and Germany. The usage of Arabic script was suppressed in German East Africa and to a lesser extent in British East Africa. Nevertheless, well into the 1930s and 1940s, rural literacy rate in Arabic script as well as a local preference to write Swahili in the Arabic script (an unmodified version as opposed to proposals such as that of Mwalimu Sikujua) was relatively high. There were also differences in orthographic conventions between cities and authors and over the centuries, some quite precise but others different enough to cause difficulties with intelligibility. Thus despite a lack of official governmental backing, attempts at standardization and Swahilization of the Arabic script continued into the 20th century.

==Grammar==
===Noun classes ===
Swahili nouns are separable into classes, which are roughly analogous to genders in other languages. In Swahili, prefixes mark groups of similar objects: marks single human beings ( &#x27;child&#x27;), marks multiple humans ( &#x27;children&#x27;), marks abstract nouns ( &#x27;childhood&#x27;), and so on. And just as adjectives and pronouns must agree with the gender of nouns in some languages with grammatical gender, so in Swahili adjectives, pronouns and even verbs must agree with nouns. This is a characteristic feature of all the Bantu languages.

====Semantic motivation====
The &quot;ki-/vi-&quot; class historically consisted of two separate genders, artefacts (Bantu class 7/8, utensils and hand tools mostly) and diminutives (Bantu class 12/13), which were conflated at a stage ancestral to Swahili. Examples of the former are &quot;kisu&quot; &quot;knife&quot;, &quot;kiti&quot; &quot;chair&quot; (from &quot;mti&quot; &quot;tree, wood&quot;), &quot;chombo&quot; &quot;vessel&quot; (a contraction of &quot;ki-ombo&quot;). Examples of the latter are &quot;kitoto&quot; &quot;infant&quot;, from &quot;mtoto&quot; &quot;child&quot;; &quot;kitawi&quot; &quot;frond&quot;, from &quot;tawi&quot; &quot;branch&quot;; and &quot;chumba&quot; (&quot;ki-umba&quot;) &quot;room&quot;, from &quot;nyumba&quot; &quot;house&quot;. It is the diminutive sense that has been furthest extended. An extension common to diminutives in many languages is &quot;approximation&quot; and &quot;resemblance&quot; (having a &#x27;little bit&#x27; of some characteristic, like &quot;-y&quot; or &quot;-ish&quot; in English). For example, there is &quot;kijani&quot; &quot;green&quot;, from &quot;jani&quot; &quot;leaf&quot; (compare English &#x27;leafy&#x27;), &quot;kichaka&quot; &quot;bush&quot; from &quot;chaka&quot; &quot;clump&quot;, and &quot;kivuli&quot; &quot;shadow&quot; from &quot;uvuli&quot; &quot;shade&quot;. A &#x27;little bit&#x27; of a verb would be an instance of an action, and such &quot;instantiations&quot; (usually not very active ones) are found: &quot;kifo&quot; &quot;death&quot;, from the verb &quot;-fa&quot; &quot;to die&quot;; &quot;kiota&quot; &quot;nest&quot; from &quot;-ota&quot; &quot;to brood&quot;; &quot;chakula&quot; &quot;food&quot; from &quot;kula&quot; &quot;to eat&quot;; &quot;kivuko&quot; &quot;a ford, a pass&quot; from &quot;-vuka&quot; &quot;to cross&quot;; and &quot;kilimia&quot; &quot;the Pleiades&quot;, from &quot;-limia&quot; &quot;to farm with&quot;, from its role in guiding planting. A resemblance, or being a bit like something, implies marginal status in a category, so things that are marginal examples of their class may take the &quot;ki-/vi-&quot; prefixes. One example is &quot;chura&quot; (&quot;ki-ura&quot;) &quot;frog&quot;, which is only half terrestrial and therefore is marginal as an animal. This extension may account for disabilities as well: &quot;kilema&quot; &quot;a cripple&quot;, &quot;kipofu&quot; &quot;a blind person&quot;, &quot;kiziwi&quot; &quot;a deaf person&quot;. Finally, diminutives often denote contempt, and contempt is sometimes expressed against things that are dangerous. This might be the historical explanation for &quot;kifaru&quot; &quot;rhinoceros&quot;, &quot;kingugwa&quot; &quot;spotted hyena&quot;, and &quot;kiboko&quot; &quot;hippopotamus&quot; (perhaps originally meaning &quot;stubby legs&quot;).

Another class with broad semantic extension is the &quot;m-/mi-&quot; class (Bantu classes 3/4). This is often called the &#x27;tree&#x27; class, because &quot;mti, miti&quot; &quot;tree(s)&quot; is the prototypical example. However, it seems to cover vital entities neither human nor typical animals: trees and other plants, such as &quot;mwitu&quot; &#x27;forest&#x27; and &quot;mtama&quot; &#x27;millet&#x27; (and from there, things made from plants, like &quot;mkeka&quot; &#x27;mat&#x27;); supernatural and natural forces, such as &quot;mwezi&quot; &#x27;moon&#x27;, &quot;mlima&quot; &#x27;mountain&#x27;, &quot;mto&quot; &#x27;river&#x27;; active things, such as &quot;moto&quot; &#x27;fire&#x27;, including active body parts (&quot;moyo&quot; &#x27;heart&#x27;, &quot;mkono&quot; &#x27;hand, arm&#x27;); and human groups, which are vital but not themselves human, such as &quot;mji&quot; &#x27;village&#x27;, and, by analogy, &quot;mzinga&quot; &#x27;beehive/cannon&#x27;. From the central idea of &quot;tree&quot;, which is thin, tall, and spreading, comes an extension to other long or extended things or parts of things, such as &quot;mwavuli&quot; &#x27;umbrella&#x27;, &quot;moshi&quot; &#x27;smoke&#x27;, &quot;msumari&quot; &#x27;nail&#x27;; and from activity there even come active instantiations of verbs, such as &quot;mfuo&quot; &quot;metal forging&quot;, from &quot;-fua&quot; &quot;to forge&quot;, or &quot;mlio&quot; &quot;a sound&quot;, from &quot;-lia&quot; &quot;to make a sound&quot;. Words may be connected to their class by more than one metaphor. For example, &quot;mkono&quot; is an active body part, and &quot;mto&quot; is an active natural force, but they are also both long and thin. Things with a trajectory, such as &quot;mpaka&quot; &#x27;border&#x27; and &quot;mwendo&quot; &#x27;journey&#x27;, are classified with long thin things, as in many other languages with noun classes. This may be further extended to anything dealing with time, such as &quot;mwaka&quot; &#x27;year&#x27; and perhaps &quot;mshahara&quot; &#x27;wages&#x27;. Animals exceptional in some way and so not easily fitting in the other classes may be placed in this class.

The other classes have foundations that may at first seem similarly counterintuitive. In short,
*Classes 1–2 include most words for people: kin terms, professions, ethnicities, etc., including translations of most English words ending in &quot;-er.&quot; They include a couple of generic words for animals: &quot;mnyama&quot; &#x27;beast&#x27;, &quot;mdudu&quot; &#x27;bug&#x27;.
*Classes 5–6 have a broad semantic range of groups, expanses, and augmentatives. Although interrelated, it is easier to illustrate if broken down:
**Augmentatives, such as &quot;joka&quot; &#x27;serpent&#x27; from &quot;nyoka&quot; &#x27;snake&#x27;, lead to titles and other terms of respect (the opposite of diminutives, which lead to terms of contempt): &quot;Bwana&quot; &#x27;Sir&#x27;, &quot;shangazi&quot; &#x27;aunt&#x27;, &quot;fundi&quot; &#x27;craftsman&#x27;, &quot;kadhi&quot; &#x27;judge&#x27;
**Expanses: &quot;ziwa&quot; &#x27;lake&#x27;, &quot;bonde&quot; &#x27;valley&#x27;, &quot;taifa&quot; &#x27;country&#x27;, &quot;anga&quot; &#x27;sky&#x27;
***from this, mass nouns: &quot;maji&quot; &#x27;water&#x27;, &quot;vumbi&quot; &#x27;dust&#x27; (and other liquids and fine particulates that may cover broad expanses), &quot;kaa&quot; &#x27;charcoal&#x27;, &quot;mali&quot; &#x27;wealth&#x27;, &quot;maridhawa&quot; &#x27;abundance&#x27;
**Collectives: &quot;kundi&quot; &#x27;group&#x27;, &quot;kabila&quot; &#x27;language/ethnic group&#x27;, &quot;jeshi&quot; &#x27;army&#x27;, &quot;daraja&quot; &#x27; stairs&#x27;, &quot;manyoya&quot; &#x27;fur, feathers&#x27;, &quot;mapesa&quot; &#x27;small change&#x27;, &quot;manyasi&quot; &#x27;weeds&#x27;, &quot;jongoo&quot; &#x27;millipede&#x27; (large set of legs), &quot;marimba&quot; &#x27;xylophone&#x27; (large set of keys)
***from this, individual things found in groups: &quot;jiwe&quot; &#x27;stone&#x27;, &quot;tawi&quot; &#x27;branch&#x27;, &quot;ua&quot; &#x27;flower&#x27;, &quot;tunda&quot; &#x27;fruit&#x27; (also the names of most fruits), &quot;yai&quot; &#x27;egg&#x27;, &quot;mapacha&quot; &#x27;twins&#x27;, &quot;jino&quot; &#x27;tooth&#x27;, &quot;tumbo&quot; &#x27;stomach&#x27; (cf. English &quot;guts&quot;), and paired body parts such as &quot;jicho&quot; &#x27;eye&#x27;, &quot;bawa&quot; &#x27;wing&#x27;, etc.
***also collective or dialogic actions, which occur among groups of people: &quot;neno&quot; &#x27;a word&#x27;, from &quot;kunena&quot; &#x27;to speak&#x27; (and by extension, mental verbal processes: &quot;wazo&quot; &#x27;thought&#x27;, &quot;maana&quot; &#x27;meaning&#x27;); &quot;pigo&quot; &#x27;a stroke, blow&#x27;, from &quot;kupiga&quot; &#x27;to hit&#x27;; &quot;gomvi&quot; &#x27;a quarrel&#x27;, &quot;shauri&quot; &#x27;advice, plan&#x27;, &quot;kosa&quot; &#x27;mistake&#x27;, &quot;jambo&quot; &#x27;affair&#x27;, &quot;penzi&quot; &#x27;love&#x27;, &quot;jibu&quot; &#x27;answer&#x27;, &quot;agano&quot; &#x27;promise&#x27;, &quot;malipo&quot; &#x27;payment&#x27;
***From pairing, reproduction is suggested as another extension (fruit, egg, testicle, flower, twins, etc.), but these generally duplicate one or more of the subcategories above
*Classes 9–10 are used for most typical animals: &quot;ndege&quot; &#x27;bird&#x27;, &quot;samaki&quot; &#x27;fish&#x27;, and the specific names of typical beasts, birds, and bugs. However, this is the &#x27;other&#x27; class, for words not fitting well elsewhere, and about half of the class 9–10 nouns are foreign loanwords. Loans may be classified as 9–10 because they lack the prefixes inherent in other classes, and most native class 9–10 nouns have no prefix. Thus they do not form a coherent semantic class, though there are still semantic extensions from individual words.
*Class 11 (which takes class 10 for the plural) are mostly nouns with an &quot;extended outline shape&quot;, in either one dimension or two:
**mass nouns that are generally localized rather than covering vast expanses: &quot;uji&quot; &#x27;porridge&#x27;, &quot;wali&quot; &#x27;cooked rice&#x27;
**broad: &quot;ukuta&quot; &#x27;wall&#x27;, &quot;ukucha&quot; &#x27;fingernail&#x27;, &quot;upande&quot; &#x27;side&#x27; (≈ &quot;ubavu&quot; &#x27;rib&#x27;), &quot;wavu&quot; &#x27;net&#x27;, &quot;wayo&quot; &#x27;sole, footprint&#x27;, &quot;ua&quot; &#x27;fence, yard&#x27;, &quot;uteo&quot; &#x27;winnowing basket&#x27;
**long: &quot;utambi&quot; &#x27;wick&#x27;, &quot;utepe&quot; &#x27;stripe&#x27;, &quot;uta&quot; &#x27;bow&#x27;, &quot;ubavu&quot; &#x27;rib&#x27;, &quot;ufa&quot; &#x27;crack&#x27;, &quot;unywele&quot; &#x27;a hair&#x27;
***from &#x27;a hair&#x27;, singulatives of nouns, which are often class 6 (&#x27;collectives&#x27;) in the plural: &quot;unyoya&quot; &#x27;a feather&#x27;, &quot;uvumbi&quot; &#x27;a mote of dust&#x27;, &quot;ushanga&quot; &#x27;a bead&#x27;.
*Class 14 are abstractions, such as &quot;utoto&quot; &#x27;childhood&#x27; (from &quot;mtoto&quot; &#x27;a child&#x27;) and have no plural. They have the same prefixes and concord as class 11, except optionally for adjectival concord.
*Class 15 are verbal infinitives.
*Classes 16–18 are locatives. The Bantu nouns of these classes have been lost; the only permanent member is the Arabic loan &quot;mahali&quot; &#x27;place(s)&#x27;, but in Mombasa Swahili, the old prefixes survive: &quot;pahali&quot; &#x27;place&#x27;, &quot;mwahali&quot; &#x27;places&#x27;. However, any noun with the locative suffix &quot;-ni&quot; takes class 16–18 agreement. The distinction between them is that class 16 agreement is used if the location is intended to be definite (&quot;at&quot;), class 17 if indefinite (&quot;around&quot;) or involves motion (&quot;to, toward&quot;), and class 18 if it involves containment (&quot;within&quot;): &quot;mahali pazuri&quot; &#x27;a good spot&#x27;, &quot;mahali kuzuri&quot; &#x27;a nice area&#x27;, &quot;mahali muzuri&quot; (it&#x27;s nice in there).

====Borrowing====
Borrowings may or may not be given a prefix corresponding to the semantic class they fall in. For example, Arabic &quot;dūd&quot; (&quot;bug, insect&quot;) was borrowed as &quot;mdudu&quot;, plural &quot;wadudu&quot;, with the class 1/2 prefixes &quot;m-&quot; and &quot;wa-&quot;, but Arabic &quot;fulūs&quot; (&quot;fish scales&quot;, plural of &quot;fals&quot;) and English &quot;sloth&quot; were borrowed as simply &quot;fulusi&quot; (&quot;mahi-mahi&quot; fish) and &quot;slothi&quot; (&quot;sloth&quot;), with no prefix associated with animals (whether those of class 9/10 or 1/2).

In the process of naturalization of borrowings within Swahili, loanwords are often reinterpreted, or reanalysed, as if they already contain a Swahili class prefix. In such cases the interpreted prefix is changed with the usual rules. Consider the following loanwords from Arabic:
#The Swahili word for &quot;book&quot;, &quot;kitabu&quot;, is borrowed from Arabic &quot;kitāb(un)&quot; &quot;book&quot; (plural &quot;kutub&quot;; from the Arabic root &quot;k.t.b.&quot; &quot;write&quot;). However, the Swahili plural form of this word (&quot;books&quot;) is vitabu&quot;, following Bantu grammar in which the &quot;ki-&quot; of kitabu&quot; is reanalysed (reinterpreted) as a nominal class prefix whose plural is &quot;vi-&quot; (class 7/8). 
#Arabic &quot;muʿallim(un)&quot; (&quot;teacher&quot;, plural &quot;muʿallimīna&quot;) was interpreted as having the mw- prefix of class 1, and so became &quot;mwalimu&quot;, plural &quot;walimu&quot;. 
#Arabic &quot;madrasa&quot; school, even though it is singular in Arabic (with plural &quot;madāris&quot;), was reinterpreted as a class 6 plural &quot;madarasa&quot;, receiving the singular form &quot;darasa&quot;.

Similarly, English &quot;wire&quot; and Arabic &quot;waqt&quot; (&quot;time&quot;) were interpreted as having the class 11 prevocalic prefix &quot;w-&quot;, and became &quot;waya&quot; and &quot;wakati&quot; with plural &quot;nyaya&quot; and &quot;nyakati&quot; respectively.

===Agreement===

Swahili phrases agree with nouns in a system of concord but, if the noun refers to a human, they accord with noun classes 1–2 regardless of their noun class. Verbs agree with the noun class of their subjects and objects; adjectives, prepositions and demonstratives agree with the noun class of their nouns. In Standard Swahili &quot;(Kiswahili sanifu)&quot;, based on the dialect spoken in Zanzibar, the system is rather complex; however, it is drastically simplified in many local variants where Swahili is not a native language, such as in Nairobi. In non-native Swahili, concord reflects only animacy: human subjects and objects trigger &quot;a-, wa-&quot; and &quot;m-, wa-&quot; in verbal concord, while non-human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger &quot;i-, zi-&quot;. Infinitives vary between standard &quot;ku-&quot; and reduced &quot;i-.&quot; (&quot;Of&quot; is animate &quot;wa&quot; and inanimate &quot;ya, za.&quot;)

In Standard Swahili, human subjects and objects of whatever class trigger animacy concord in &quot;a-, wa-&quot; and &quot;m-, wa-,&quot; and non-human subjects and objects trigger a variety of gender-concord prefixes.

==Dialects and closely related languages==
This list is based on &quot;Swahili and Sabaki: a linguistic history&quot;.

===Dialects===
Modern standard Swahili, written in Latin, is based on &quot;Kiunguja,&quot; the dialect spoken in Zanzibar City.

Swahili literature and poetry, traditionally written in Swahili Ajami, is based on &quot;Kiamu&quot;, the dialect of Lamu on the Kenyan Coast.

But there are numerous other dialects of Swahili, some of which are mutually unintelligible, such as the following:

====Old dialects====
Maho (2009) considers these to be distinct languages:
*&quot;Kimwani&quot; is spoken in the Kerimba Islands and northern coastal Mozambique.
*&quot;Chimwiini&quot; is spoken by the ethnic minorities in and around the town of Barawa on the southern coast of Somalia.
*&quot;Kibajuni&quot; is spoken by the Bajuni minority ethnic group on the coast and islands on both sides of the Somali–Kenyan border and in the Bajuni Islands (the northern part of the Lamu archipelago) and is also called &quot;Kitikuu&quot; and &quot;Kigunya&quot;.
*Socotra Swahili (extinct)
*Sidi, in Gujarat, India (possibly extinct)
The rest of the dialects are divided by him into two groups:
*Mombasa–Lamu Swahili
**Lamu
*** The dialects of the Lamu group (especially Kiamu, Kipate, Kingozi) are the linguistic base of the oldest () Swahili manuscripts and poems that reached us. They are sometimes described as &quot;literary&quot; dialects but they were also used for everyday life and are still spoken today except Kingozi.
***&quot;Kiamu&quot; is spoken in and around the island of Lamu (Amu) and have an important corpus of classical poems of the 18th and 19th centuries written in Arabic script (Kiajemi).
***&quot;Kipate&quot; is a local dialect of Pate Island, considered to be closest to the original dialect of Kingozi. It has also an important classical corpus of poems from the 18th and 19th centuries.
***&quot;Kingozi&quot; is an extinct dialect spoken on the Indian Ocean coast between Lamu and Somalia and is sometimes still used in poetry. It is often considered the source of Swahili. Academic theories about Kingozi as an old literary dialect are conflicting. It is sometimes linked to the epics of Liongo. For Sacleux, it&#x27;s and old and &quot;an exclusively literary, arcane dialect&quot;. It varies depending on the authors whose will to return to a pure form of the old language make them use Kigunya mainly (Kipate is a subdialect of Kigunya) and secondarily Kiamu and Kimvita. Knappert, on the contrary, states the existence of a literary koine in the 18th century based on the Kingozi as a prestigious and widespread dialect. The 2009 New Updated Guthrie List, a referential classification of the Bantu languages, considers kiOzi as a dialect in itself. It is not the ancestor language of Kiswahili but a member of the Lamu group (code G42a) with Kiamu, Kipate and Kisiu. This brief overview indicates that the state of research is fragmented and uncertain on the history of the kingozi. 
**Mombasa
***&quot;Chijomvu&quot; is a subdialect of the Mombasa area.
***&quot;Kimvita&quot; is the major dialect of Mombasa (also known as &quot;Mvita&quot;, which means &quot;war&quot;, in reference to the many wars which were fought over it, the other major dialect alongside Kiunguja. It has an important classical corpus written in Arabic script from the 18st and 19st century.
***&quot;Kingare&quot; is the subdialect of the Mombasa area.
**&quot;Kimrima&quot; is spoken around Pangani, Vanga, Dar es Salaam, Rufiji and Mafia Island.
**&quot;Kiunguja&quot; is spoken in Zanzibar City and environs on Unguja (Zanzibar) Island. Kitumbatu (Pemba) dialects occupy the bulk of the island.
**Mambrui, Malindi
**&quot;Chichifundi&quot;, a dialect of the southern Kenya coast.
**Chwaka
**&quot;Kivumba&quot;, a dialect of the southern Kenya coast.
**Nosse Be (Madagascar)
*Pemba Swahili
**&quot;Kipemba&quot; is a local dialect of the Pemba Island.
**&quot;Kitumbatu&quot; and &quot;Kimakunduchi&quot; are the countryside dialects of the island of Zanzibar. Kimakunduchi is a recent renaming of &quot;Kihadimu&quot;; the old name means &quot;serf&quot; and so is considered pejorative.
**Makunduchi
**Mafia, Mbwera
**Kilwa (extinct)
**&quot;Kimgao&quot; used to be spoken around Kilwa District and to the south.

Maho includes the various Comorian dialects as a third group. Most other authorities consider Comorian to be a Sabaki language, distinct from Swahili.

===Other regions===
In Somalia, where the Afroasiatic Somali language predominates, a variant of Swahili referred to as Chimwiini (also known as Chimbalazi) is spoken along the Benadir coast by the Bravanese people. Another Swahili dialect known as Kibajuni also serves as the mother tongue of the Bajuni minority ethnic group, which lives in the tiny Bajuni Islands as well as the southern Kismayo region.

In Oman, there are an estimated people who speak Swahili as of 2020. Most are descendants of those repatriated after the fall of the Sultanate of Zanzibar.

===Pidgins and creoles===
There are Swahili-based slangs, pidgins and creoles:
*

==Oral literature==

===19th-century collections===
In 1870, Edward Steere published Swahili Tales as Told by Natives of Zanzibar, a collection of 23 Swahili tales with facing-text English translation, along with a selection of proverbs and riddles. Some of the tales included are: &quot;Kisa cha Punda wa Dobi,&quot; &quot;The Story of the Washerman&#x27;s Donkey,&quot; also known as &quot;The Heart of a Monkey;&quot; &quot;Mwalimu Goso,&quot; &quot;Goso the Teacher,&quot; a cumulative tale; and
&quot;Sungura na Simba,&quot; &quot;The Hare and the Lion,&quot; a story about the trickster hare.

Here are some of the proverbs that Steere recorded in Swahili:
*&quot;&quot;Mbio za sakafuni hwishia ukingoni&quot;.&quot; &quot;Running on a roof ends at the edge of it.&quot;
*&quot;&quot;Angurumapo simba, mteza nani&quot;?&quot; &quot;Who will dance to a lion&#x27;s roaring?&quot;
*&quot;&quot;Mlevi wa mvinyo hulevuka, mlevi wa mali halevuki&quot;.&quot; &quot;He that is drunk with wine gets sober, he that is drunk with wealth does not.&quot;
*&quot;&quot;Kikulacho kinguoni mwako&quot;.&quot; &quot;What bites is in your own clothes.&quot;

Here are some of the riddles that Steere recorded in Swahili:
*&quot;Nyumba yangu kubwa, haina mlango (yayi).&quot; &quot;My house is large; it has no door (egg).&quot;
*&quot;Kuku wangu akazalia miibani (nanasi).&quot; &quot;My hen has laid among thorns (pineapple).&quot;
*&quot;Popo mbili zavuka mto (macho).&quot; &quot;Two nuts cross a river (eyes).&quot;
Steere also includes the formulaic announcement of a riddle:
*&quot;Kitendawili! — Tega.&quot; &quot;An enigma! — Set your trap.&quot;

An anonymous publication from 1881, Swahili Stories from Arab Sources with an English Translation, includes 15 stories in Swahili with English translations, plus an additional 14 Swahili stories that are not translated. There is also a selection of proverbs and riddles with English translations.

Here are some of the proverbs:
*&quot;&quot;Tulingane sawasawa, kama sahani na kawa&quot;.&quot; &quot;We match together, like a dish and a cover.&quot;
*&quot;&quot;Samaki mmoja akioza, wameoza wote&quot;.&quot; &quot;If one fish is bad, they are all bad.&quot;
*&quot;&quot;Wa kuume haukati wa kushoto&quot;.&quot; &quot;The right hand does not cut the left.&quot;
*&quot;&quot;Paka akiondoka, panya hutawala&quot;.&quot; &quot;When the cat goes away, the rat is king.&quot;

Here are some of the riddles:
*&quot;&quot;Gumugumu huzaa teketeke, gumugumu teketeke huzaa (mahindi)&quot;.&quot; &quot;The hard is the parent of the soft, and the soft of the hard (maize).&quot;
*&quot;&quot;Mtoto wangu killa mwaka hulala chini (boga)&quot;.&quot; &quot;My child each year lies on the ground (pumpkin).&quot;
*&quot;Nyumba vangu kubwa haina taa (kaburi).&quot; &quot;My great house has no lamp (grave).&quot;
*&quot;Nimetupa mshale wangu, mchana kwenda mbali nikitupa usiku hauendi mbali (macho).&quot; &quot;I cast my arrow in the day time, it went far off; it I cast it at night, it does not go far (eyes).&quot;

<text>A summary offence or petty offence is a violation in some common law jurisdictions that can be proceeded against summarily, without the right to a jury trial and/or indictment (required for an indictable offence).

==Canada==
In Canada, summary offences are referred to as summary conviction offences. As in other jurisdictions, summary conviction offences are considered less serious than indictable offences because they are punishable by shorter prison sentences and smaller fines. These offences appear both in the federal laws of Canada and in the legislation of Canada&#x27;s provinces and territories. For summary conviction offences that fall under the jurisdiction of the federal government (including all criminal law), section 787 of the Criminal Code specifies that, unless another punishment is provided for by law, the maximum penalty for a summary conviction offence is a sentence of 2 years less a day of imprisonment, a fine of $5,000 or both.

As a matter of practical effect, some common differences between summary conviction and indictable offences are provided below.

===Summary conviction offences===
* Accused must be charged with a summary conviction within one year after the act happened. Limitation periods are set out in the Criminal Code.
* The police can arrest under summary conviction without an arrest warrant if found committing a summary offence notwithstanding s. 495(2)(c) of the Criminal Code.
* If the police do not find committing a summary offence, an arrest warrant is required.
* Accused does not have to submit fingerprints when charged under Summary Conviction.
* Appeals of summary conviction offences go first to the highest trial court within the jurisdiction (e.g., provincial superior court in Alberta is the Court of King&#x27;s Bench).
* After Provincial Superior Court a further appeal would go to the Provincial Court of Appeal (e.g., the Court of Appeal of Alberta), and then finally to the Supreme Court of Canada, but as a practical matter very few summary convictions are ever heard by the Supreme Court of Canada.
* Accused convicted under summary conviction are eligible for a pardon after five years provided the accused is not convicted of any further offences during that period.
* Always tried in a provincial court (cannot be joined with an indictable offence in a superior court).

===Indictable offences===
* There is no time limit to when charges can be laid, such that an accused can be charged at any time after an act has occurred. The exception to this point is treason, which has a 3-year limitation period.
* Police do not require a warrant to arrest under an indictable offence: see S.495(1)(a) Criminal Code
* Accused has to submit fingerprints when required to appear to answer to an indictable offence.
* Appeals always go to the Provincial Court of Appeal first, and then on to the Supreme Court of Canada.
* Accused convicted under an indictable offence can apply for a pardon after 10 years.

== Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong, trials for summary offences are heard in one of the territory&#x27;s Magistrates&#x27; Courts, unless the defendant is accused with other indictable offence(s). Typical examples for summary offences in Hong Kong include possession of a simulated bomb, drunkenness, taking photographs in courts, careless driving and pretending to be a public officer. 

==New Zealand==
Under New Zealand law, summary offences are covered by the Summary Offences Act 1981, and include offences that resemble forgery, fraud, nuisance, as well as offences against public order. It also covers some aspects of search, arrest and jurisdiction, as well as regulating the sale of spray paint.

==United Kingdom==
In relation to England and Wales, the expression &quot;summary trial&quot; means a trial in the magistrates&#x27; court. In such proceedings there is no jury; the appointed judge, or a panel of three lay magistrates, decides the guilt or innocence of the accused. Each summary offence is specified by statute which describes the (usually minor) offence and the judge to hear it. A summary procedure can result in a summary conviction. A &quot;summary offence&quot; is one which, if charged to an adult, can only be tried by summary procedure. Similar procedures are also used in Scotland.

Certain offences that may be tried in a Crown Court (by jury) may be required to be tried summarily if the value involved is small; such offences are still considered either way offences, so are not thereby &quot;summary offences&quot; in the meaning of that term defined by statute. Contrariwise, certain summary offences may in certain circumstances be tried on indictment along with other offences that are themselves indictable; they do not thereby become &quot;indictable offences&quot; or &quot;either way offences&quot; but remain &quot;summary offences&quot;, though tried by jury.

Sir William Blackstone, in his Commentaries on the Laws of England (1765–1769), described summary offences thus:

In the United Kingdom, trials for summary offences are heard in one of a number of types of lower court. For England and Wales this is the Magistrates&#x27; Court. In Scotland, it is the Sheriff Court or Justice of the peace court, depending on the offence (the latter being primarily for the most minor of offences). Northern Ireland has its own Magistrates&#x27; Court system.

== United States ==
In United States federal and state law, &quot;there are certain minor or petty offenses that may be proceeded against summarily, and without a jury&quot;. These can include criminal and civil citations, where a person may be charged with a criminal or non-criminal infraction without the need of a physical arrest, such as in cases of non-violent fineable violations, crimes that carry little incarceration time, or non-criminal acts such as speeding. Any crime that is punishable by the controlling law for more than six months of imprisonment must have some means for a jury trial. Some states, such as California, provide that all defendants are entitled to a jury trial (irrespective of the nature of their offenses). In any case, for summary criminal offenses in the United States, convictions can still show as such on a criminal record.

Contempt of court is considered a prerogative of the court, as &quot;the requirement of a jury does not apply to contempts committed in disobedience of any lawful writ, process, order, rule, decree, or command entered in any suit or action brought or prosecuted in the name of, or on behalf of, the United States&quot;. There have been criticisms over the practice. In particular, Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black wrote in a 1964 dissent: &quot;It is high time, in my judgment, to wipe out root and branch the judge-invented and judge-maintained notion that judges can try criminal contempt cases without a jury.&quot;

<doc id="28456" wikidata="Q393" url="?curid=28456" title="Szczecin">
<text>Szczecin ( , , ; ; ; or ) is the capital and largest city of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship in northwestern Poland. Located near the Baltic Sea and the German border, it is a major seaport, the largest city of northwestern Poland, and seventh-largest city of Poland. the population was 391,566.

Szczecin is located on the Oder River, south of the Szczecin Lagoon and the Bay of Pomerania. The city is situated along the southwestern shore of Dąbie Lake, on both sides of the Oder and on several large islands between the western and eastern branches of the river. It is also surrounded by dense forests, shrubland and heaths, chiefly the Wkrzańska Heath shared with Germany (Ueckermünde) and the Szczecin Landscape Park. Szczecin is adjacent to the town of Police and is the urban centre of the Szczecin agglomeration, an extended metropolitan area that includes communities in the German states of Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.

The city&#x27;s recorded history dates back over 1,300 years, when diverse tribes and peoples such as the Vikings and Lechites erected strongholds in the vicinity. It subsequently served as the seat of the Dukes of Pomerania and the House of Griffin. In the course of the millennium, Szczecin was part of Piast Poland, Denmark, the Holy Roman Empire, Sweden, Prussia, Germany and modern-day Poland. The city&#x27;s architecture and cultural heritage reflects these periods, with excellent examples of Brick Gothic, Gründerzeit, Neoclassical, socialist realist and contemporary styles. The planned urban landscape was based on the Orion constellation, with avenues, roundabouts and extensive parkland. The city&#x27;s chief landmarks include the Szczecin Cathedral, the Ducal Castle, the National Museum and the Szczecin Philharmonic.

Szczecin is the administrative and industrial centre of West Pomeranian Voivodeship and is the site of the University of Szczecin, Pomeranian Medical University, Maritime University, West Pomeranian University of Technology, Szczecin Art Academy, and the see of the Szczecin-Kamień Catholic Archdiocese. From 1999 onwards, Szczecin has served as the site of the headquarters of NATO&#x27;s Multinational Corps Northeast. The city was a candidate for the European Capital of Culture in 2016.

== Name and etymology ==
 and are the Polish and German equivalents of the same name, which is of Proto-Slavic origin, though the exact etymology is the subject of ongoing research. 
In her &quot;Etymological Dictionary of Geographical Names of Poland&quot;, Maria Malec lists 11 theories regarding the origin of the name, including derivations from either: an Old Slavic word for &#x27;hill peak&#x27; (), the plant fuller&#x27;s teasel (), or the personal name .

Other medieval names for the town are &quot;Burstaborg&quot; (in the Knytlinga saga) and &quot;Burstenburgh&quot; (in the Annals of Waldemar). These names, which literally mean &#x27;brush burgh&#x27;, are likely derived from the translation of the city&#x27;s Slavic name (assuming the second derivation mentioned above).

== History ==


=== Middle Ages ===
The recorded history of Szczecin began in the eighth century, when Vikings and West Slavs settled in Pomerania. The West Slavs, or Lechites, erected a new stronghold on the site of the modern castle.
Since the 9th century, the stronghold was fortified and expanded toward the Oder bank. Mieszko I of Poland took control of Pomerania during the Early Middle Ages and the region became part of Poland in the 10th century. However, already Mieszko II Lambert (1025 ~ 1034) effectively lost control over the area and had to accept German suzerainty over the area of the Oder lagoon. Subsequent Polish rulers, the Holy Roman Empire, and the Liutician federation all aimed to control the territory.

After the decline of the neighbouring regional centre Wolin in the 12th century, the city became one of the more important and powerful seaports of the Baltic Sea.

In a campaign in the winter of 1121–1122, Bolesław III Wrymouth, the Duke of Poland, gained control of the region, including the city of Szczecin and its stronghold. The Polish ruler initiated Christianization, entrusting this task to Otto of Bamberg, and the inhabitants were Christianised by two missions of Otto in 1124 and 1128. At this time, the first Christian church of Saints Peter and Paul was erected. The Poles&#x27; minted coins were commonly used in trade in this period. The population of the city at that time is estimated to be at around 5,000–9,000 people.

Polish rule ended with Boleslaw&#x27;s death in 1138. During the Wendish Crusade in 1147, a contingent led by the German margrave Albert the Bear, an enemy of Slavic presence in the region, papal legate, bishop Anselm of Havelberg and Konrad of Meissen besieged the town. There, a Polish contingent supplied by Mieszko III the Old joined the crusaders. However, the citizens had placed crosses around the fortifications, indicating they already had been Christianised. Duke Ratibor I of Pomerania, negotiated the disbanding of the crusading forces.

After the Battle of Verchen in 1164, Szczecin duke Bogusław I, Duke of Pomerania became a vassal of the Duchy of Saxony&#x27;s Henry the Lion. In 1173, Szczecin castellan Wartislaw II, could not resist a Danish attack and became vassal of Denmark. In 1181, Bogusław became a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1185, Bogusław again became a Danish vassal. Despite falling under foreign suzerainty, local dukes maintained close ties with the fragmented Polish realm, and future Polish monarch Władysław III Spindleshanks stayed at the local court of Duke Bogusław I in 1186, on behalf of his father, Duke of Greater Poland Mieszko III the Old, who also periodically was the High Duke of Poland. Following a conflict between his heirs and Canute VI of Denmark, the settlement was destroyed in 1189, but the fortress was reconstructed and manned with a Danish force in 1190. While the empire restored its superiority over the Duchy of Pomerania in the Battle of Bornhöved in 1227, Szczecin was one of two bridgeheads remaining under Danish control (until 1235; Wolgast until 1241/43 or 1250).

In the second half of the 12th century, a group of German tradesmen (&quot;multus populus Teutonicorum&quot; from various parts of the Holy Roman Empire) settled in the city around St.Jacob&#x27;s Church, which was donated in 1180 by Beringer, a trader from Bamberg, and consecrated in 1187. Hohenkrug (now in Szczecin Struga) was the first village in the Duchy of Pomerania that was clearly recorded as German (&quot;villa teutonicorum&quot;) in 1173. Ostsiedlung accelerated in Pomerania during the 13th century. Duke Barnim I of Pomerania granted Szczecin a local government charter in 1237, separating the German settlement from the Slavic community settled around the St. Nicholas Church in the neighbourhood of Kessin (). In the charter, the Slavs were put under Germanic jurisdiction.

When Barnim granted Szczecin Magdeburg rights in 1243, part of the Slavic settlement was reconstructed. The duke had to promise to level the burgh in 1249. Most Slavic inhabitants were resettled to two new suburbs north and south of the town.

In 1249, Barnim I also granted equivalent Magdeburg town privileges to the town of Damm (also known as Altdamm) on the eastern bank of the Oder. Damm merged with neighbouring Szczecin on 15October 1939 and is now the Dąbie neighbourhood. This town had been built on the site of a former Pomeranian burg, &quot;Vadam&quot; or &quot;Dambe&quot;, which Boleslaw had destroyed during his 1121 campaign.

On 2 December 1261, Barnim I allowed Jewish settlement in Szczecin in accordance with the Magdeburg law, in a privilege renewed in 1308 and 1371. The Jewish Jordan family was granted citizenship in 1325, but none of the 22 Jews allowed to settle in the duchy in 1481 lived in the city, and in 1492, all Jews in the duchy were ordered to convert to Christianity or leavethis order remained effective throughout the rest of the Griffin era.

In 1273, in Szczecin duke of Poznań and future King of Poland Przemysł II married princess Ludgarda, granddaughter of Barnim I, Duke of Pomerania, in order to strengthen the alliance between the two rulers.

Szczecin was part of the federation of Wendish towns, a predecessor of the Hanseatic League, in 1283. The city prospered due to its participation in the Baltic Sea trade, primarily with herring, grain, and timber; craftsmanship also prospered, and more than forty guilds were established in the city. The far-reaching autonomy granted by the House of Griffins was in part reduced when the dukes reclaimed Stettin as their main residence in the late 15th century. The anti-Slavic policies of German merchants and craftsmen intensified in this period, resulting in measures such as bans on people of Slavic descent joining craft guilds, a doubling of customs tax for Slavic merchants, and bans against public usage of their native language. The more prosperous Slavic citizens were forcibly stripped of their possessions, which were then handed over to Germans. In 1514, the guild of tailors added a &quot;Wendenparagraph&quot; to its statutes, banning Slavs.

While not as heavily affected by medieval witchhunts as other regions of the empire, there are reports of the burning of three women and one man convicted of witchcraft in 1538.

In 1570, during the reign of John Frederick, Duke of Pomerania, a congress was held at Stettin ending the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War. During the war, Stettin had tended to side with Denmark, while Stralsund tended toward Swedenas a whole, however, the Duchy of Pomerania tried to maintain neutrality. Nevertheless, a Landtag that had met in Stettin in 1563 introduced a sixfold rise in real estate taxes to finance the raising of a mercenary army for the duchy&#x27;s defence. Johann Friedrich also succeeded in elevating Stettin to one of only three places allowed to coin money in the Upper Saxon Circle of the Holy Roman Empire, the other two places being Leipzig and Berlin. Bogislaw XIV, who resided in Stettin beginning in 1620, became the sole ruler and Griffin duke when Philipp Julius, Duke of Pomerania died in 1625. Before the Thirty Years&#x27; War reached Pomerania, the city, as well as the entire duchy, declined economically due to the decrease in importance of the Hanseatic League and a conflict between Stettin and Frankfurt an der Oder.

=== 17th to 18th centuries ===
Following the Treaty of Stettin of 1630, the town (along with most of Pomerania) was allied to and occupied by the Swedish Empire, which managed to keep the western parts of Pomerania after the death of BogislawXIV in 1637. From the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, Stettin became the Capital of Swedish Pomerania. Stettin was turned into a major Swedish fortress, which was repeatedly besieged in subsequent wars. The next Treaty of Stettin (1653) did not change this, but due to the downfall of the Swedish Empire after Charles XII, the city went to Prussia in 1720. Instead Stralsund became capital of the last remaining parts of Swedish Pomerania 1720–1815.

The city was on the path of Polish forces led by Hetman Stefan Czarniecki moving from Denmark during the Second Northern War. Czarniecki, who led his forces to the city, is today mentioned in the Polish anthem, and numerous locations in the city honour his name.

Wars inhibited the city&#x27;s economic prosperity, which had undergone a deep crisis during the devastation of the Thirty Years&#x27; War and was further impeded by the new Swedish-Brandenburg-Prussian frontier, cutting Stettin off from its traditional Farther Pomeranian hinterland. Due to a Plague during the Great Northern War, the city&#x27;s population dropped from 6,000 people in 1709 to 4,000 in 1711. In 1720, after the Great Northern War, Sweden was forced to cede the city to King Frederick William I of Prussia. Stettin was made the capital city of the Prussian Pomeranian province, since 1815 reorganised as the Province of Pomerania. In 1816, the city had 26,000 inhabitants.
The Prussian administration deprived the city of its right to administrative autonomy, abolished guild privileges as well as its status as a staple town, and subsidised manufacturers. Also, colonists were settled in the city, primarily French Huguenots. The French established a prosperous community, greatly contributed to the city&#x27;s economic revival, and were treated with reluctance by the German burghers and city authorities.

=== 19th to 20th centuries ===
In October 1806, during the War of the Fourth Coalition, believing that he was facing a much larger force, and after receiving a threat of harsh treatment of the city, the Prussian commander Lieutenant General Friedrich von Romberg agreed to surrender the city to the French led by General Lasalle. In fact, Lasalle had only 800 men against vonRomberg&#x27;s 5,300 men. In March 1809 Romberg was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for giving up Stettin without a fight. In 1809, also Polish troops were stationed in the city, while the French remained until 1813.

From 1683 to 1812, one Jew was permitted to reside in Stettin, and an additional Jew was allowed to spend a night in the city in case of &quot;urgent business&quot;. These permissions were repeatedly withdrawn between 1691 and 1716, also between 1726 and 1730 although else the Swedish regulation was continued by the Prussian administration. Only after the Prussian Edict of Emancipation of 11March 1812, which granted Prussian citizenship to all Jews living in the kingdom, did a Jewish community emerge in Stettin, with the first Jews settling in the town in 1814. Construction of a synagogue started in 1834; the community also owned a religious and a secular school, an orphanage since 1855, and a retirement home since 1893. The Jewish community had between 1,000 and 1,200 members by 1873 and between 2,800 and 3,000 members by 192728. These numbers dropped to 2,701 in 1930 and to 2,322 in late 1934.

After the Franco Prussian war of 1870–1871, 1,700 French POWs were imprisoned there in deplorable conditions, resulting in the deaths of 600; after the Second World War monuments in their memory were built by the Polish authorities.

Until 1873, Stettin remained a fortress. When part of the defensive structures were levelled, a new neighbourhood, &quot;Neustadt&quot; (&quot;New Town&quot;) as well as water pipes, sewerage and drainage, and gas works were built to meet the demands of the growing population.

Stettin developed into a major Prussian port and became part of the German Empire in 1871. While most of the province retained its agrarian character, Stettin was industrialised, and its population rose from 27,000 in 1813 to 210,000 in 1900 and 255,500 in 1925. Major industries that flourished in Stettin from 1840 were shipbuilding, chemical and food industries, and machinery construction. Starting in 1843, Stettin became connected to the major German and Pomeranian cities by railways, and the water connection to the Bay of Pomerania was enhanced by the construction of the Kaiserfahrt (now Piast) canal. The city was also a scientific centre; for example, it was home to the Entomological Society of Stettin.

On 20 October 1890, some of the city&#x27;s Poles created the &quot;Society of Polish-Catholic Workers&quot; in the city, one of the first Polish organisations. In 1897, the city&#x27;s ship works began the construction of the pre-dreadnought battleship &quot;Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse&quot;. In 1914, before World WarI, the Polish community in the city numbered over 3,000 people, contributing about 2% of the population. These were primarily industrial workers and their families who came from the Poznań (Posen) area and a few local wealthy industrialists and merchants. Among them was Kazimierz Pruszak, director of the Gollnow industrial works and a Polish patriot, who predicted the eventual &quot;return&quot; of Szczecin to Poland.

During the interwar period, Stettin was Weimar Germany&#x27;s largest port on the Baltic Sea, and her third-largest port after Hamburg and Bremen. Cars of the Stoewer automobile company were produced in Stettin from 1899 to 1945. By 1939, the Reichsautobahn BerlinStettin was completed.

Stettin played a major role as an entrepôt in the development of the Scottish herring trade with the Continent, peaking at an annual export of more than 400,000 barrels in 1885, 1894 and 1898. Trade flourished until the outbreak of the First World War and resumed on a reduced scale during the years between the wars.

In the March 1933 German elections to the Reichstag, the Nazis and German nationalists from the German National People&#x27;s Party (or DNVP) won most of the votes in the city, together winning 98,626 of 165,331 votes (59.3%), with the NSDAP getting 79,729 (47.9%) and the DNVP 18,897 (11.4%).

In 1935, the Wehrmacht made Stettin the headquarters for WehrkreisII, which controlled the military units in all of Mecklenburg and Pomerania. It was also the area headquarters for units stationed at StettinI and II; Swinemünde (Świnoujście); Greifswald; and Stralsund.

In the interwar period, the Polish minority numbered 2,000 people, less than 1% of the city&#x27;s population at that time. A number of Poles were members of the Union of Poles in Germany (ZPN), which was active in the city from 1924. A Polish consulate was located in the city between 1925 and 1939. On the initiative of the consulate and ZPN activist Maksymilian Golisz, a number of Polish institutions were established, e.g., a Polish Scout team and a Polish school. German historian Musekamp writes, &quot;however, only very few Poles were active in these institutions, which for the most part were headed by employees of the [Polish] consulate.&quot; The withdrawal of the consulate from these institutions led to a general decline of these activities, which were in part upheld by Golisz and Aleksander Omieczyński. Intensified repressions by the Nazis, who exaggerated the Polish activities to propagate an infiltration, led to the closing of the school. In 1938, the head of Szczecin&#x27;s Union of Poles unit, Stanisław Borkowski, was imprisoned in Sachsenhausen concentration camp in Oranienburg, Germany. In 1939, all Polish organisations in Stettin were disbanded by the German authorities. Golisz and Omieczyński were murdered during the war. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, a street was named after Golisz. According to German historian Jan Musekamp, the activities of the Polish pre-war organizations were exaggerated after World War II for propaganda purposes.

==== World War II ====

During World War II, Stettin was the base for the German 2nd Motorised Infantry Division, which cut across the so-called Polish Corridor and was later used in 1940 as an embarkation point for Operation Weserübung, Germany&#x27;s assault on Denmark and Norway.

On 15 October 1939, neighbouring municipalities were joined to Stettin, creating Groß-Stettin, with about 380,000 inhabitants, in 1940. The city had become the third-largest German city by area, after Berlin and Hamburg.

As the war started, the number of non-Germans in the city increased as slave workers were brought in. The first transports came in 1939 from Bydgoszcz, Toruń and Łódź. They were mainly used in a synthetic silk factory near Stettin. The next wave of slave workers was brought in 1940, in addition to PoWs who were used for work in the agricultural industry. According to German police reports from 1940, 15,000 Polish slave workers lived within the city.

During the war, 135 forced labour camps for slave workers were established in the city. Most of the 25,000 slave workers were Poles, but Czechs, Italians, Frenchmen and Belgians, as well as Dutch citizens, were also enslaved in the camps. A Nazi prison was also operated in the city, with forced labour subcamps in the region.

In February 1940, the Jews of Stettin were deported to the Lublin reservation. International press reports emerged, describing how the Nazis forced Jews, regardless of age, condition and gender, to sign away all property and loaded them onto trains headed to the camp, escorted by members of the SA and SS. Due to publicity given to the event, German institutions ordered such future actions to be made in a way unlikely to attract public notice. The action was the first deportation of Jews from prewar territory in Nazi Germany.

Allied air raids in 1944 and heavy fighting between the German and Soviet armies destroyed 65% of Stettin&#x27;s buildings and almost all of the city centre, the seaport, and local industries. Polish Home Army intelligence assisted in pinpointing targets for Allied bombing in the area of Stettin. The city itself was covered by the Home Army&#x27;s &quot;Bałtyk&quot; structure, and Polish resistance infiltrated Stettin&#x27;s naval yards. Other activities of the resistance consisted of smuggling people, including Polish and British POWs who escaped from German captivity, to Sweden, and distribution of Polish underground press.

The Soviet Red Army captured the city on 26April 1945. While the majority of the almost 400,000 inhabitants had left the city, between 6,000 and 20,000 inhabitants remained in late April.

On 28 April 1945 Polish authorities tried to gain control, but in the following month, the Polish administration was twice forced to leave. The reason for this was, according to Polish sources, that the Western Allies raised protest against the Soviet and Polish policy of creating a fait-accomplit in Eastern Germany. Finally the permanent handover occurred on 5July 1945. In the meantime, part of the German population had returned, believing it might become part of the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. The Soviet authorities had already appointed the German Communists Erich Spiegel and Erich Wiesner as mayors. Stettin is located mostly west of the Oder River, which was expected to become Poland&#x27;s new western border, placing Stettin in East Germany. This would have been in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement between the victorious Allied powers, which envisaged the new border to be in &quot;a line running from the Baltic Sea immediately west of Swinemünde, and thence along the Oder River[...]&quot;. Because of the returnees, the German population of the town swelled to 84,000. The mortality rate was at 20%, primarily due to starvation. However, Stettin and the mouth of the Oder River became Polish on 5July 1945, as had been decided in a treaty signed on 26July 1944 between the Soviet Union and the Soviet-controlled Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN) (also known as &quot;the Lublin Poles&quot;, as contrasted with the London-based Polish government-in-exile). On 4October 1945, the decisive land border of Poland was established west of the 1945 line, and the city was renamed to its historic Polish name Szczecin, but the area excluded the Police area, the Oder River itself and the port of Szczecin, which remained under Soviet administration. The Oder River was handed over to Polish administration in September 1946, followed by the port between February 1946 and May 1954.

==== Post-war ====
While in 1945 the number of pre-war inhabitants dropped to 57,215 on 31 October 1945, the systematic expulsion of Germans started on 22 February 1946 and continued until late 1947, in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. In December 1946 about 17,000 German inhabitants remained, while the number of Poles living in the city reached 100,000. To ease the tensions between settlers from different regions, and help overcome fear caused by the continued presence of the Soviet troops, a special event was organised in April 1946 with 50,000 visitors in the partly destroyed city centre. Settlers from Central Poland made up about 70% of Szczecin&#x27;s new population. In addition to Poles, Ukrainians from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union settled there. Also Poles repatriated from Harbin, China and Greeks, refugees of the Greek Civil War, settled in Szczecin in the following years. In 1945 and 1946, the city was the starting point of the northern route used by the Jewish underground organisation Brichah to channel Jewish displaced persons from Central and Eastern Europe to the American occupation zone.

Szczecin was rebuilt, and the city&#x27;s industry was expanded. At the same time, Szczecin became a major Polish industrial centre and an important seaport (particularly for Silesian coal) for Poland, Czechoslovakia and East Germany. Cultural expansion was accompanied by a campaign resulting in the &quot;removal of all German traces&quot;. In 1946, Winston Churchill prominently mentioned the city in his Iron Curtain speech: &quot;From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the Continent&quot;.

The city witnessed anti-communist revolts in 1956, 1970 and 1980. On 30 August 1980, first of the four &quot;August Agreements&quot;, which led to the first legalisation of the trade union Solidarity, was signed in Szczecin. The introduction of martial law in December 1981 met with a strike by the dockworkers of Szczecin shipyard, joined by other factories and workplaces in a general strike. All these were suppressed by the authorities. Pope John Paul II visited the city on 11June 1987. Another wave of strikes in Szczecin broke out in 1988 and 1989, which eventually led to the Round Table Agreement and first semi-free elections in post-war Poland.

Szczecin has been the capital of the West Pomeranian Voivodeship since 1999.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
Szczecin has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;) with some humid continental (&quot;Dfb&quot;) characteristics in normal not updated, typical of Western Pomerania. The winters are colder than on the immediate coast and the summers are warm, but still with some moderation, especially due to the Baltic Sea.

The average air temperature in Szczecin ranges from 8 to 8.4 °C. The hottest month is July with a temperature of 15.8 °C to 20.3 °C, the coldest January from -4.1 °C to 2.6 °C. Air temperature below 0 °C occurs on average over 86 days a year, most frequently in January and February. The average annual rainfall is 537 mm, the average rainfall in the cool half-year is 225 mm, and in the warmer half-year is 350 mm. On average, 167 days with precipitation occurs.


=== Architecture and urban planning ===

Szczecin&#x27;s architectural style reflects trends popular in the last half of the 19th century and the first years of the 20th century: Academic art (historicist Gründerzeit) and Art Nouveau. In many areas built after 1945, especially in the city centre, which had been partly destroyed due to Allied bombing, social realism is prevalent.

The city has an abundance of green areas: parks and avenueswide streets with trees planted in the island separating opposing traffic (where often tram tracks are laid); and roundabouts corresponding to the Orion constellation. Szczecin&#x27;s city plan resembles that of Paris, mostly because Szczecin was remodelled in the 1880s according to a design by Georges-Eugène Haussmann, who had redesigned Paris under Napoléon III. This pattern of street design is still used in Szczecin, as many recently built (or modified) city areas include roundabouts and avenues.

During the city&#x27;s reconstruction in the aftermath of World War II, the communist authorities of Poland wanted the city&#x27;s architecture to reflect an old Polish Piast era. Since no buildings from that time existed, instead Gothic as well as Renaissance buildings were picked as worthy of conservation. The motivation behind this decision was that Renaissance architecture was used by the Griffin dynasty, which had Lechitic and West Slavic roots and was seen to be of Piast extraction by some historians. This view was manifested, for example, by erecting respective memorials, and the naming of streets and enterprises, while German traces were replaced by symbols of three main categories: Piasts, the martyrdom of Poles, and gratitude to the Soviet and Polish armies which had ended the Nazi atrocities against Polish citizens.

The ruins of the former Griffin residence, initially renamed &quot;Piast Palace&quot;, also played a central role in this concept and were reconstructed in Renaissance style, with all traces of later eras removed. In general, post-Renaissance buildings, especially those from the 19th and early 20th centuries, were deemed unworthy of conservation until the 1970s, and were in part used in the &quot;Bricks for Warsaw&quot; campaign (an effort to rebuild Warsaw after it had been systematically razed following the Warsaw Uprising): with 38 million bricks, Szczecin became Poland&#x27;s largest brick supplier. The Old Town was rebuilt in the late 1990s, with new buildings, some of which were reconstructions of buildings destroyed in World WarII.

The Gothic monuments preserved to this day are parts of European Route of Brick Gothic, along with monuments of other Pomeranian cities, e.g. Stargard, Kamień Pomorski, Sławno and Chełmno.

A portion of the Szczecin Landscape Park in the forest of Puszcza Bukowa lies within Szczecin&#x27;s boundaries.

Szczecin contains 28 extant historic water pumps, known as Szczecin pumps or Berliners, which are a popular tourist attraction due to their colorful and intricate design.

=== Municipal administration ===

The city is administratively divided into districts (Polish: &quot;dzielnica&quot;), which are further divided into smaller neighbourhoods. The governing bodies of the latter serve the role of auxiliary local government bodies called &quot;Neighbourhood Councils&quot; (Polish: &quot;Rady Osiedla&quot;). Elections for neighbourhood councils are held up to six months after each City Council election. Voter turnout is rather low (on 20May 2007 it ranged from 1.03% to 27.75% and was 3.78% on average). Councillors are responsible mostly for small infrastructure like trees, park benches, playgrounds, etc. Other functions are mostly advisory.

== Demographics ==

Since the 12th-century Christianization of the city, the majority of the population were Catholics, then since the Renaissance era, up to the end of World War II, the vast majority of the population were Lutheran Protestants, and since 1945, the majority are again Catholics. Historically, the number of inhabitants doubled from 6,081 in 1720, to 12,360 in 1740, and reached 21,255 in 1812, with only 476 Catholics and 5 Jews. By 1852 the population was 48,028, and 58,487 ten years later (1861), including 1,065 Catholics and 1,438 Jews. In 1885, it was 99,543, and by 1905 it ballooned to 224,119 settlers (incl. the military), among them 209,152 Protestants, 8,635 Catholics and 3,010 Jews. In 1939, the number of inhabitants reached 268,421 persons according to German sources including 233,424 Protestants, 10,845 Catholics, and 1,102 Jews. The current population of Szczecin by comparison was 406,427 in 2009. Following the Revolution of Dignity, Szczecin, much like most other major urban centers in Poland, saw an unprecedented influx of foreign nationals, an overwhelming majority of them Ukrainians; in July 2017 26 thousand of them were officially registered as living and working in Szczecin, with unofficial estimates going as high as 50 thousand, thus making up more than 10% of the city&#x27;s inhabitants.

;Number of inhabitants over the centuries

== Local cuisine ==

The local cuisine in Szczecin was mostly shaped in the mid-20th century by people who settled in the city from other parts and regions of Poland, including the former Eastern Borderlands. The most renowned dishes of the area are &quot;pasztecik szczeciński&quot; and &quot;paprykarz szczeciński&quot;. Other local traditional foods and drinks include Szczecin gingerbread and beer.

&quot;Pasztecik szczeciński&quot; is a deep-fried yeast dough traditionally stuffed with minced meat (pork and beef) or vegetarian filling - cheese and mushrooms or cabbage and mushrooms, served in specialised bars as a fast food. The first bar serving &quot;pasztecik szczeciński&quot;, Bar &quot;Pasztecik&quot;, founded in 1969, is located on Wojska Polskiego Avenue 46 in the centre of Szczecin. &quot;Pasztecik szczeciński&quot; is usually served with clear red borscht.

&quot;Paprykarz szczeciński&quot; is a paste made by mixing fish paste (around 50%) with rice, onion, tomato concentrate, vegetable oil, salt and a mixture of spices including chili powder to put it on a sandwich. It is available in most grocery stores in the country.
Szczecin gingerbread (&quot;pierniki szczecińskie&quot;) is a traditional local gingerbread glazed with chocolate or sugar with decorations mostly referring either to the city&#x27;s architecture or to maritime motifs.

Szczecin beer (&quot;piwo szczecińskie&quot;) includes various types of traditional local Polish beer: light, amber, and wheat beer. The city&#x27;s brewing traditions go back over a thousand years.

The word &quot;&quot;szczeciński&quot; or &quot;szczecińskie&quot;&quot; in the names of the products is an adjective from the name of the city of Szczecin, the place of its origin.

== Sports ==

== Economy and transport ==


=== Economy ===
Szczecin is a center of the maritime economy; it employs 13279 people. The seaport of Szczecin serves shipowners from all over the world and is the home port of two shipping companies: Polsteam and Euroafrica. In addition, other maritime-related companies are headquartered here.

In 2013, a subzone of the Szczecin-Kostrzyn-Slubice Special Economic Zone was established.

As of September 2016, the number of registered unemployed in Szczecin included about 8,400 residents, representing an unemployment rate of 5.0% to the economically active population.

The average employee salary in October 2012 was PLN 3807.73, with the number of employed workers in Szczecin - 90,754 people. According to data from the District Labor Office in Szczecin, effective 1 January 2023, the minimum wage is PLN 3490, while the average salary of residents of the capital of West Pomerania is at PLN 6733.49.

In 2009, the average gross monthly salary in the enterprise sector in Szczecin was PLN 3439.94.

Szczecin&#x27;s GDP is PLN 20.255 billion, which is 1/3 of the GDP of the entire province. There are 49497 zlotys per capita, about 40% more than the result for the province.

=== Air ===
Szczecin is served by Solidarity Szczecin–Goleniów Airport, which is northeast of central Szczecin. There is also a grass airstrip within city limits, the Szczecin-Dąbie Airstrip.

=== Trams ===

Szczecin has a tram network comprising 12 tram lines serving 95 tram stops and measuring in length. Tram transport is operated by the Tramwaje Szczecińskie (TS).

Szczecin&#x27;s first horse tram opened in 1879, running from Gałczyńskiego Square to Staszica Street. In 1896, the first line using electric traction was opened. By 1900, the horse trams had been entirely replaced by electric trams.

=== Buses ===

Szczecin has a bus network of 70 bus routes. Bus transport is operated by 4companies: SPA Dąbie, SPA Klonowica, SPPK and PKS Szczecin.

Of all bus routes, 50 lines are designated as normal. At nighttime, Szczecin is served by a night bus network of 16 routes. There are also 7express bus lines, which do not serve all stops on their route.

=== Roads ===
The recently upgraded A6 motorway serves as the southern bypass of the city, and connects to the German A11 autobahn (portions of which are currently undergoing upgrade), from where one can reach Berlin in about 90 minutes (about ). Other important highways are the S3 Expressway, linking Szczecin with the more southern cities of Gorzów Wielkopolski, Zielona Góra and Legnica, and the S6 Expressway, connecting Szczecin with Koszalin (and eventually Gdańsk once the easternmost section is completed). Through intersections with other highways, Szczecin has convenient highway connections with a number of other major Polish cities, such as Poznań, Łódź, Wrocław, Katowice, Warsaw and Kraków. Also planned is the construction of the S10 highway to connect the city with Bydgoszcz, Toruń, Płock and Warsaw.

=== Rail ===

The main railway stationSzczecin Główny railway stationis situated in the city centre (Kolumba Street). Szczecin has good railway connections with &quot;Solidarity&quot; Szczecin–Goleniów Airport and the rest of Poland, e.g., Świnoujście, Kołobrzeg, Poznań, Wrocław, Warsaw and Gdańsk. Szczecin is also connected with Germany (Berlin (Gesundbrunnen) and through Pasewalk to Neubrandenburg and Lübeck), but only by two single-track, non-electrified lines. Because of this, the rail connection between Berlin and Szczecin is much slower and less convenient than what is typical for two European cities of that size and proximity.

=== Port ===
The Port of Szczecin is the third largest port in Poland and handles over 32million tons of cargo annually. This is a harbour of the Baltic Sea and the Oder river.

<text>The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) was a neutrino observatory located 2100 m underground in Vale&#x27;s Creighton Mine in Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. The detector was designed to detect solar neutrinos through their interactions with a large tank of heavy water.

The detector was turned on in May 1999, and was turned off on 28 November 2006. The SNO collaboration was active for several years after that analyzing the data taken.

The director of the experiment, Art McDonald, was co-awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2015 for the experiment&#x27;s contribution to the discovery of neutrino oscillation.

The underground laboratory has been enlarged into a permanent facility and now operates multiple experiments as SNOLAB. The SNO equipment itself was being refurbished for use in the SNO+ experiment.

==Experimental motivation==

The first measurements of the number of solar neutrinos reaching the Earth were taken in the 1960s, and all experiments prior to SNO observed a third to a half fewer neutrinos than were predicted by the Standard Solar Model. As several experiments confirmed this deficit the effect became known as the solar neutrino problem. Over several decades many ideas were put forward to try to explain the effect, one of which was the hypothesis of neutrino oscillations. All of the solar neutrino detectors prior to SNO had been sensitive primarily or exclusively to electron neutrinos and yielded little to no information on muon neutrinos and tau neutrinos.

In 1984, Herb Chen of the University of California at Irvine first pointed out the advantages of using heavy water as a detector for solar neutrinos. Unlike previous detectors, using heavy water would make the detector sensitive to two reactions, one reaction sensitive to all neutrino flavours, the other reaction sensitive to only electron neutrino. Thus, such a detector could measure neutrino oscillations directly. A location in Canada was attractive because Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, which maintains large stockpiles of heavy water to support its CANDU reactor power plants, was willing to lend the necessary amount (worth at market prices) at no cost.

The Creighton Mine in Sudbury is among the deepest in the world and, accordingly, experiences a very small background flux of radiation. It was quickly identified as an ideal place for Chen&#x27;s proposed experiment to be built, and the mine management was willing to make the location available for only incremental costs.

The SNO collaboration held its first meeting in 1984. At the time it competed with TRIUMF&#x27;s KAON Factory proposal for federal funding, and the wide variety of universities backing SNO quickly led to it being selected for development. The official go-ahead was given in 1990.

The experiment observed the light produced by relativistic electrons in the water created by neutrino interactions. As relativistic electrons travel through a medium, they lose energy producing a cone of blue light through the Cherenkov effect, and it is this light that is directly detected.

==Detector description==


The SNO detector target consisted of of heavy water contained in a acrylic vessel. The detector cavity outside the vessel was filled with normal water to provide both buoyancy for the vessel and radiation shielding. The heavy water was viewed by approximately 9,600 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) mounted on a geodesic sphere at a radius of about . The cavity housing the detector was the largest in the world at such a depth, requiring a variety of high-performance rock bolting techniques to prevent rock bursts. The mining was completed in May 1993.

The observatory is located at the end of a drift, named the &quot;SNO drift&quot;, isolating it from other mining operations. Along the drift are a number of operations and equipment rooms, all held in a clean room setting. Most of the facility is Class 3000 (fewer than 3,000 particles of 1 μm or larger per 1 ft3 of air) but the final cavity containing the detector is an even stricter Class 100.

===Charged current interaction===
In the charged current interaction, a neutrino converts the neutron in a deuteron to a proton. The neutrino is absorbed in the reaction and an electron is produced. Solar neutrinos have energies smaller than the mass of muons and tau leptons, so only electron neutrinos can participate in this reaction. The emitted electron carries off most of the neutrino&#x27;s energy, on the order of 5–15 MeV, and is detectable. The proton which is produced does not have enough energy to be detected easily. The electrons produced in this reaction are emitted in all directions, but there is a slight tendency for them to point back in the direction from which the neutrino came.

===Neutral current interaction===
In the neutral current interaction, a neutrino dissociates the deuteron, breaking it into its constituent neutron and proton. The neutrino continues on with slightly less energy, and all three neutrino flavours are equally likely to participate in this interaction. Heavy water has a small cross section for neutrons, but when neutrons are captured by a deuterium nucleus, a gamma ray (photon) with roughly 6 MeV of energy is produced. The direction of the gamma ray is completely uncorrelated with the direction of the neutrino. Some of the neutrons produced from the dissociated deuterons make their way through the acrylic vessel into the light water jacket surrounding the heavy water, and since light water has a very large cross section for neutron capture, these neutrons are captured very quickly. Gamma rays of roughly 2.2 MeV are produced in this reaction, but because the energy of the photons is less than the detector&#x27;s energy threshold (meaning they do not trigger the photomultipliers), they are not directly observable. However, when the gamma ray collides with an electron via Compton scattering, the accelerated electron can be detected through Cherenkov radiation.

===Electron elastic scattering===
In the elastic scattering interaction, a neutrino collides with an atomic electron and imparts some of its energy to the electron. All three neutrinos can participate in this interaction through the exchange of the neutral Z boson, and electron neutrinos can also participate with the exchange of a charged W boson. For this reason this interaction is dominated by electron neutrinos, and this is the channel through which the Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) detector can observe solar neutrinos. This interaction is the relativistic equivalent of billiards, and for this reason the electrons produced usually point in the direction that the neutrino was travelling (away from the sun). Because this interaction takes place on atomic electrons it occurs with the same rate in both the heavy and light water.

==Experimental results and impact==
The first scientific results of SNO were published on 18 June 2001, and presented the first clear evidence that neutrinos oscillate (i.e. that they can transmute into one another), as they travel from the Sun. This oscillation, in turn, implies that neutrinos have non-zero masses. The total flux of all neutrino flavours measured by SNO agrees well with theoretical predictions. Further measurements carried out by SNO have since confirmed and improved the precision of the original result.

Although Super-K had beaten SNO to the punch, having published evidence for neutrino oscillation as early as 1998, the Super-K results were not conclusive and did not specifically deal with solar neutrinos. SNO&#x27;s results were the first to directly demonstrate oscillations in solar neutrinos. This was important to the standard solar model. In 2007, the Franklin Institute awarded the director of SNO Art McDonald with the Benjamin Franklin Medal in Physics. In 2015 the Nobel Prize for Physics was jointly awarded to Arthur B. McDonald, and Takaaki Kajita of the University of Tokyo, for the discovery of neutrino oscillations.

==Other possible analyses==
The SNO detector would have been capable of detecting a supernova within our galaxy if one had occurred while the detector was online. As neutrinos emitted by a supernova are released earlier than the photons, it is possible to alert the astronomical community before the supernova is visible. SNO was a founding member of the Supernova Early Warning System (SNEWS) with Super-Kamiokande and the Large Volume Detector. No such supernovae have yet been detected.

The SNO experiment was also able to observe atmospheric neutrinos produced by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere. Due to the limited size of the SNO detector in comparison with Super-K, the low cosmic ray neutrino signal is not statistically significant at neutrino energies below 1 GeV.

<text>Super-Kamiokande (abbreviation of Super-Kamioka Neutrino Detection Experiment, also abbreviated to Super-K or SK; ) is a neutrino observatory located under Mount Ikeno near the city of Hida, Gifu Prefecture, Japan. It is operated by the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, University of Tokyo with the help of an international team. It is located 1,000 m (3,300 ft) underground in the Mozumi Mine in Hida&#x27;s Kamioka area. The observatory was designed to detect high-energy neutrinos, to search for proton decay, study solar and atmospheric neutrinos, and keep watch for supernovae in the Milky Way  galaxy.

==Description==
Super-K is located underground in the Mozumi Mine in Hida&#x27;s Kamioka area. It consists of a cylindrical stainless steel tank that is tall and in diameter holding 50,220 tonnes (55,360 US tons) of ultrapure water. The tank volume is divided by a stainless steel superstructure into an inner detector (ID) region, which is in height and in diameter, and outer detector (OD) which consists of the remaining tank volume. Mounted on the superstructure are 11,146 photomultiplier tubes (PMT) in diameter that face the ID and 1,885 PMTs that face the OD. A Tyvek and blacksheet barrier attached to the superstructure optically separates the ID and OD.

A neutrino interaction with the electrons or nuclei of water can produce a charged particle that moves faster than the speed of light in water, which is slower than the speed of light in vacuum. This creates a cone of light known as Cherenkov radiation, which is the optical equivalent to a sonic boom. The Cherenkov light is projected as a ring on the wall of the detector and recorded by the PMTs. Using the timing and charge information recorded by each PMT, the interaction vertex, ring direction, and flavor of the incoming neutrino is determined. From the sharpness of the edge of the ring the type of particle can be inferred. The multiple scattering of electrons is large, so electromagnetic showers produce fuzzy rings. Highly relativistic muons, in contrast, travel almost straight through the detector and produce rings with sharp edges.

==History==

Construction of the predecessor of the present Kamioka Observatory, the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, University of Tokyo began in 1982 and was completed in April 1983. The purpose of the observatory was to determine the existence of proton decay, one of the most fundamental questions of elementary particle physics.

The detector, named KamiokaNDE for Kamioka Nucleon Decay Experiment, was a tank in height and in width, containing 3,058 tonnes (3,400 US tons) of pure water and about 1,000 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) attached to its inner surface. The detector was upgraded, starting in 1985, to allow it to observe solar neutrinos. As a result, the detector (KamiokaNDE-II) had become sensitive enough to detect ten neutrinos from SN 1987A, a supernova which was observed in the Large Magellanic Cloud in February 1987, and to observe solar neutrinos in 1988. The ability of the Kamiokande experiment to observe the direction of electrons produced in solar neutrino interactions allowed experimenters to directly demonstrate for the first time that the Sun was a source of neutrinos.

While making discoveries in neutrino astronomy and neutrino astrophysics, Kamiokande never detected a proton decay, the primary goal for its construction. The absence of any such observation pushed back the possible half-life of any potential proton decay far enough to eliminate some of the GUT models which allow for such a decay. Other models predict a longer half-life, with rarer decays.

To increase the chance of detecting such decays, a larger detector was needed. A higher sensitivity was also necessary to obtain a higher statistical confidence in other detections. This led to the design and construction of Super-Kamiokande, with fifteen times the volume of water and ten times as many PMTs as Kamiokande.

The Super-Kamiokande project was approved by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports and Culture in 1991 for total funding of approximately $100 million. The American portion of the proposal, which was primarily to build the OD system, was approved by the United States Department of Energy in 1993 for $3 million. In addition, the United States has also contributed about 2000 20 cm PMTs recycled from the IMB experiment.

Super-Kamiokande started operation in 1996 and announced the first evidence of neutrino oscillation in 1998. This was the first experimental observation supporting the theory that the neutrino has non-zero mass, a possibility that theorists had speculated about for years. The 2015 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Super-Kamiokande researcher Takaaki Kajita alongside Arthur McDonald at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory for their work confirming neutrino oscillation.

On 12 November 2001, about 6,600 of the photomultiplier tubes imploded in a chain reaction, as the shock wave from the concussion of each imploding tube cracked its neighbours. The detector was partially restored by redistributing the photomultiplier tubes which did not implode, and by adding protective acrylic shells that are hoped will prevent another chain reaction from recurring (Super-Kamiokande-II).

In July 2005, preparations began to restore the detector to its original form by reinstalling about 6,000 PMTs. The work was completed in June 2006, whereupon the detector was renamed Super-Kamiokande-III. This phase of the experiment collected data from October 2006 till August 2008. At that time, significant upgrades were made to the electronics. After the upgrade, the new phase of the experiment has been referred to as Super-Kamiokande-IV. SK-IV collected data on various natural sources of neutrinos, as well as acted as the far detector for the Tokai-to-Kamioka (T2K) long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment.

SK-IV continued until June 2018. After that, the detector underwent a full refurbishment during Autumn of 2018. On 29 January 2019 the detector resumed data acquisition.

In 2020, the detector was upgraded for the SuperKGd project by adding a gadolinium salt to the ultrapure water in order to enable the detection of antineutrinos from supernova explosions.

==Detector==
The Super-Kamiokande (SK) is a Cherenkov detector used to study neutrinos from different sources including the Sun, supernovae, the atmosphere, and accelerators. It is also used to search for proton decay. The experiment began in April 1996 and was shut down for maintenance in July 2001, a period known as &quot;SK-I&quot;. Since an accident occurred during maintenance, the experiment resumed in October 2002 with only half of its original number of ID-PMTs.

In order to prevent further accidents, all of the ID-PMTs were covered by fiber-reinforced plastic with acrylic front windows. This phase from October 2002 to another closure for an entire reconstruction in October 2005 is called &quot;SK-II&quot;. In July 2006, the experiment resumed with the full number of PMTs and stopped in September 2008 for electronics upgrades. This period was known as &quot;SK-III&quot;. The period after 2008 is known as &quot;SK-IV&quot;. The phases and their main characteristics are summarised in table 1.
===SK-IV upgrade===
In the previous phases, the ID-PMTs processed signals by custom electronics modules called analog timing modules (ATMs). Charge-to-analog converters (QAC) and time-to-analog converters (TAC) are contained in these modules that had dynamic range from 0 to 450 picocoulombs (pC) with 0.2 pC resolution for charge and from −300 to 1000 ns with 0.4 ns resolution for time. There were two pairs of QAC/TAC for each PMT input signal, this prevented dead time and allowed the readout of multiple sequential hits that may arise, &quot;e.g.&quot;, from electrons that are decay products of stopping muons.

The SK system was upgraded in September 2008 in order to maintain the stability in the next decade and improve the throughput of the data acquisition systems, QTC-based electronics with Ethernet (QBEE). The QBEE provides high-speed signal processing by combining pipelined components. These components are a newly developed custom charge-to-time converter (QTC) in the form of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a multi-hit time-to-digital converter (TDC), and field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Each QTC input has three gain ranges &quot;Small&quot;, &quot;Medium&quot;, and &quot;Large&quot; – the resolutions for each are shown in Table.

For each range, analog-to-digital conversion is conducted separately, but the only range used is that with the highest resolution that is not being saturated. The overall charge dynamic range of the QTC is 0.2–2500 pC, five times larger than the old . The charge and timing resolution of the QBEE at the single photoelectron level is 0.1 photoelectrons and 0.3 ns respectively, both are better than the intrinsic resolution of the 20-in. PMTs used in SK. The QBEE achieves good charge linearity over a wide dynamic range. The integrated charge linearity of the electronics is better than 1%. The thresholds of the discriminators in the QTC are set to −0.69 mV (equivalent to 0.25 photoelectron, which is the same as for SK-III). This threshold was chosen to replicate the behavior of the detector during its previous ATM-based phases.

===SuperKGd===
Gadolinium was introduced into the Super-Kamiokande water tank in 2020 in order to distinguish neutrinos from antineutrinos that arise from supernova explosions. This is known as the SK-Gd project (other names include SuperKGd, SUPERK-GD, and similar names). In the first phase of the project, 1.3 tons of a Gd salt (gadolinium sulfate octahydrate, ) were added to the ultrapure water in 2020, giving 0.02% (by mass) of the salt. This amount is about a tenth of the planned final target concentration.

Nuclear fusion in the Sun and other stars turns protons into neutrons with the emission of neutrinos. Beta decay in the Earth and in supernovas turns neutrons into protons with the emission of anti-neutrinos. The Super-Kamiokande detects electrons knocked off a water molecule producing a flash of blue Cherenkov light, and these are produced both by neutrinos and antineutrinos. A rarer instance is when an antineutrino interacts with a proton in water to produce a neutron and a positron.

Gadolinium has an affinity for neutrons and produces a bright flash of gamma rays when it absorbs one. Adding gadolinium to the Super-Kamiokande allows it to distinguish between neutrinos and antineutrinos. Antineutrinos produce a double flash of light about 30 microseconds apart, first when the neutrino hits a proton and second when gadolinium absorbs a neutron. The brightness of the first flash allows physicists to distinguish between low-energy antineutrinos from the Earth and high-energy antineutrinos from supernovas. In addition to observing neutrinos from distant supernovas, the Super-Kamiokande will be able to set off an alarm to inform astronomers around the world of the presence of a supernova in the Milky Way within one second of it occurring.

The biggest challenge was whether the detector&#x27;s water could be continuously filtered to remove impurities without removing the gadolinium at the same time. A 200-ton prototype called EGADS with added gadolinium sulfate was installed in the Kamioka mine and operated for years. It finished operation in 2018 and showed that the new water purification system would remove impurities while keeping the gadolinium concentration stable. It also showed that gadolinium sulfate would not significantly impair the transparency of the otherwise ultrapure water, or cause corrosion or deposition on existing equipment or on the new valves that will later be installed in the Hyper-Kamiokande.

===Water tank===
The outer shell of the water tank is a cylindrical stainless-steel tank 39 m in diameter and 42 m in height. The tank is self-supporting, with concrete backfilled against the rough-hewn stone walls to counteract water pressure when the tank is filled. The capacity of the tank exceeds 50 kilotonnes of water.

===PMTs and associate structure===
The basic unit for the ID PMTs is a &quot;supermodule&quot;, a frame which supports a 3×4 array of PMTs. Supermodule frames are 2.1 m in height, 2.8 m in width, and 0.55 m in thickness. These frames are connected to each other in both the vertical and horizontal directions. Then the whole support structure is connected to the bottom of the tank and to the top structure. In addition to serving as rigid structural elements, supermodules simplified the initial assembly of the ID.

Each supermodule was assembled on the tank floor and then hoisted into its final position. Thus the ID is in effect tiled with supermodules. During installation, ID PMTs were pre-assembled in units of three for easy installation. Each supermodule has two OD PMTs attached on its back side. The support structure for the bottom PMTs is attached to the bottom of the stainless-steel tank by one vertical beam per supermodule frame. The support structure for the top of the tank is also used as the support structure for the top PMTs.

Cables from each group of three PMTs are bundled together. All cables run up the outer surface of the PMT support structure, &quot;i.e.&quot;, on the OD PMT plane, pass through cable ports at the top of the tank, and are then routed into the electronics huts.

The thickness of the OD varies slightly, but is on average about 2.6 m on top and bottom, and 2.7 m on the barrel wall, giving the OD a total mass of 18 kilotons. OD PMTs were distributed with 302 on the top layer, 308 on the bottom, and 1275 on the barrel wall.

To protect against low-energy background radiation from radon decay products in the air, the roof of the cavity and the access tunnels were sealed with a coating called Mineguard. Mineguard is a spray-applied polyurethane membrane developed for use as a rock support system and radon gas barrier in the mining industry.

The average geomagnetic field is about 450 mG and is inclined by about 45° with respect to the horizon at the detector site. This presents a problem for the large and very sensitive PMTs which prefer a much lower ambient field. The strength and uniform direction of the geomagnetic field could systematically bias photoelectron trajectories and timing in the PMTs. To counteract this 26 sets of horizontal and vertical Helmholtz coils are arranged around the inner surfaces of the tank. With these in operation the average field in the detector is reduced to about 50 mG. The magnetic field at various PMT locations were measured before the tank was filled with water.

A standard fiducial volume of approximately 22.5 kilotonnes is defined as the region inside a surface drawn 2.00 m from the ID wall to minimize the anomalous response caused by natural radioactivity in the surrounding rock.

==Monitoring system==
===Online monitoring system===
An online monitor computer located in the control room reads data from the DAQ host computer via an FDDI link. It provides shift operators with a flexible tool for selecting event display features, makes online and recent-history histograms to monitor detector performance, and performs a variety of additional tasks needed to efficiently monitor status and diagnose detector and DAQ problems. Events in the data stream can be skimmed off and elementary analysis tools can be applied to check data quality during calibrations or after changes in hardware or online software.

===Realtime supernova monitor===
To detect and identify such bursts as efficiently and promptly as possible Super-Kamiokande is equipped with an online supernova monitor system. About 10,000 total events are expected in Super-Kamiokande for a supernova explosion at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. Super-Kamiokande can measure a burst with no dead-time, up to 30,000 events within the first second of a burst. Theoretical calculations of supernova explosions suggest that neutrinos are emitted over a total time-scale of tens of seconds with about a half of them emitted during the first one or two seconds. The Super-K will search for event clusters in specified time windows of 0.5, 2, and 10 s.

Data are transmitted to realtime SN-watch analysis process every 2 minutes and analysis is completed typically in 1 minute. When supernova (SN) event candidates are found, formula_1 is calculated if the event multiplicity is larger than 16, where formula_1 is defined as the average spatial distance between events, i.e.
:formula_3

Neutrinos from supernovae interact with free protons, producing positrons which are distributed so uniformly in the detector that formula_1 for SN events should be significantly larger than for ordinary spatial clusters of events. In the Super-Kamiokande detector, formula_1 for uniformly distributed Monte Carlo events shows that no tail exists below formula_1⩽1000 cm. For the &quot;alarm&quot; class of burst, the events are required to have formula_1⩾900 cm for 25⩽formula_8⩽40 or formula_1⩾750 cm for formula_8&gt;40. These thresholds were determined by extrapolation from SN1987A data.

The system will run special processes to check for spallation muons when burst candidates meeting &quot;alarm&quot; criteria and make a primary decision for further process. If the burst candidate passes these checks, the data will be reanalyzed using an offline process and a final decision will be made within a few hours. During the Super-Kamiokande I running, this never occurred.
One of the important capabilities for [Super-Kamiokande] is to reconstruct the direction to supernova. By neutrino–electron scattering, formula_11, a total of 100–150 events are expected in case of a supernova at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. The direction to supernova can be measured with angular resolution
:formula_12

where N is the number of events produced by the ν–e scattering. The angular resolution, therefore, can be as good as δθ~3° for a supernova at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. In this case, not only time profile and the energy spectrum of a neutrino burst, but also the information on direction of supernova can be provided.

===Slow control monitor and offline process monitor===
There is a process called the &quot;slow control&quot; monitor, as part of the online monitoring system, watches the status of the HV systems, the temperatures of electronics crates and the status of the compensating coils used to cancel the geomagnetic field. When any deviation from norms is detected, it will alert physicists to prompt to investigate, take appropriate action, or notify experts.

To monitor and control the offline processes that analyze and transfer data, a sophisticated set of software was developed. This monitor allows non-expert shift physicists to identify and repair common problems to minimize down time, and the software package was a significant contribution to the smooth operation of the experiment and its overall high lifetime efficiency for data taking.

==Research==
===Solar neutrino===

The energy of the Sun comes from the nuclear fusion in its core where a helium atom and two electron neutrinos are generated by 4 protons. These neutrinos emitted from this reaction are called solar neutrinos. Photons, created by the nuclear fusion in the center of the Sun, take millions of years to reach the surface; on the other hand, solar neutrinos arrive at the earth in eight minutes due to their lack of interactions with matter. Hence, solar neutrinos make it possible for us to observe the inner Sun in &quot;real-time&quot; that takes millions of years for visible light.

In 1999, the Super-Kamiokande detected strong evidence of neutrino oscillation that successfully explained the solar neutrino problem. The Sun and about 80% of the visible stars produce their energy by the conversion of hydrogen to helium via

formula_13 MeV

Consequently, stars are a source of neutrinos, including the Sun. These neutrinos primarily come through the p-p chain in lower masses, and for cooler stars, primarily through the CNO cycle of heavier masses.

In the early 1990s, particularly with the uncertainties that accompanied the initial results from Kamioka II and the Ga experiments, no individual experiment required a non-astrophysical solution of the solar neutrino problem. But in aggregate, the Cl, Kamioka II, and Ga experiments indicated a pattern of neutrino fluxes that was not compatible with any adjustment of the SSM. This in turn helped motivate a new generation of spectacularly capable active detectors. These experiments are Super-Kamiokande, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO), and Borexino. Super-Kamiokande was able to detect elastic scattering (ES) events
:formula_14

which, due to the charged-current contribution to formula_15 scattering, has a relative sensitivity to formula_15 s and heavy-flavor neutrinos of ~7:1. Since the direction of the recoil electron is constrained to be very forward, the direction of the neutrinos are kept in the direction of recoil electrons. Here, formula_17 is provided where formula_18 is the angle between the direction of recoil electrons and the Sun&#x27;s position. This shows that the formula_19 solar neutrino flux can be calculated to be formula_20. Comparing to the SSM, the ratio is formula_21. The result clearly indicates the deficit of solar neutrinos.

===Atmospheric neutrino===
Atmospheric neutrinos are secondary cosmic rays produced by the decay of particles resulting from interactions of primary cosmic rays (mostly protons) with Earth atmosphere. The observed atmospheric neutrino events fall into four categories. Fully contained (FC) events have all their tracks in the inner detector, while partially contained (PC) events have escaping tracks from the inner detector. Upward through-going muons (UTM) are produced in the rock beneath the detector and go through the inner detector. Upward stopping muons (USM) are also produced in the rock beneath the detector, but stop in the inner detector.

The number of observed number of neutrinos is predicted uniformly regardless of the zenith angle. However, Super-Kamiokande found that the number of upward going muon neutrinos (generated on the other side of the Earth) is half of the number of downward going muon neutrinos in 1998. This can be explained by the neutrinos changing or oscillating into some other neutrinos that are not detected. This is called neutrino oscillation; this discovery indicates the finite mass of neutrinos and suggests an extension of the Standard Model. Neutrinos oscillate in three flavors, and all neutrinos have their rest mass. Later analysis in 2004 suggested a sinusoidal dependence of the event rate as a function of &quot;Length/Energy&quot;, which confirmed the neutrino oscillations.

===K2K Experiment===

The K2K experiment was a neutrino experiment from June 1999 to November 2004. This experiment was designed to verify oscillations observed by Super-Kamiokande through muon neutrinos. It gives first positive measurement of neutrino oscillations in conditions that both source and detector are under control. The Super-Kamiokande detector plays an important role in the experiment as the far detector. Later experiment T2K experiment continued as the second generation follow up to the K2K experiment.

===T2K Experiment===

T2K (Tokai to Kamioka) experiment is a neutrino experiment collaborated by several countries including Japan, United States, and others. The goal of T2K is to gain deeper understanding of parameters of neutrino oscillation. T2K has made a search for oscillations from muon neutrinos to electron neutrinos, and announced the first experimental indications for them in June 2011. The Super-Kamiokande detector plays as the &quot;far detector&quot;. The Super-K detector will record the Cherenkov radiation of muons and electrons created by interactions between high-energy neutrinos and water.

===Proton decay===
The proton is assumed to be absolutely stable in the Standard Model. However, the Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) predict that protons can decay into lighter energetic charged particles such as electrons, muons, pions, or others which can be observed. Kamiokande helps to rule out some of these theories. Super-Kamiokande is currently the largest detector for observation of proton decay.
==Purification==
===Water purification system===

Since 2002, the 50 kilotons of pure water have been continually reprocessed at a rate of about 30 tons per hour in a closed system. Now, raw mine water is recycled through the first step (particle filters and RO) for some time before other processes, which involve expensive expendables, are imposed. Initially, water from the Super-Kamiokande tank is passed through nominal 1 μm mesh filters to remove dust and particles, which reduce the transparency of the water for Cherenkov photons and provide a possible radon source inside the Super-Kamiokande detector.

A heat exchanger is used to cool down the water in order to reduce the PMT dark noise level as well as suppress the growth of bacteria. Surviving bacteria are killed by a UV sterilizer stage. A cartridge polisher (CP) eliminates heavy ions, which also reduce water transparency and include radioactive species. The CP module increases the typical resistivity of recirculating water from 11 MΩ cm to 18.24 MΩ cm, approaching the chemical limit.

Originally, an ion-exchanger (IE) was included in the system, but it was removed when IE resin was found to be a significant radon source. The reverse osmosis (RO) step that removes additional particulates, and the introduction of Rn-reduced air into the water that increases radon removal efficiency in the vacuum degasifier (VD) stage which follows, were installed in 1999. After that, a VD removes dissolved gases in the water.

These dissolved gases in water are a serious background event source for solar neutrinos in the MeV energy range and the dissolved oxygen encourages the growth of bacteria. The removal efficiency is about 96%. Then, the ultra filter (UF) is introduced to remove particles whose minimum size corresponds to molecular weight approximately 10,000 (or about 10 nm diameter) thanks to hollow fiber membrane filters. Finally, a membrane degasifier (MD) removes radon dissolved in water, and the measured removal efficiency for radon is about 83%. The concentration of radon gases is miniaturized by realtime detectors. In June 2001, typical radon concentrations in water coming into the purification system from the Super-Kamiokande tank were less than 2 mBq m−3, and in water output by the system, 0.4±0.2 mBq m−3.

===Air purification system===

Purified air is supplied in the gap between the water surface and the top of the Super-Kamiokande tank. The air purification system contains three compressors, a buffer tank, dryers, filters, and activated charcoal filters. A total of 8 m3 of activated charcoal is used. The last 50 L of charcoal is cooled to −40 °C to increase removal efficiency for radon. Typical flow rates, dew point, and residual radon concentration are 18 m3/h, −65 °C (@+1 kg/cm2), and a few mBq m−3, respectively. Typical radon concentration in the dome air is measured to be 40 Bq m−3.

Radon levels in the mine tunnel air, near the tank cavity dome, typically reach 2000–3000 Bq m−3 during the warm season, from May until October, while from November to April the radon level is approximately 100–300 Bq m−3. This variation is due to the chimney effect in the ventilation pattern of the mine tunnel system; in cold seasons, fresh air flows into the Atotsu tunnel entrance that is a relatively short path through exposed rock before reaching the experimental area, while in the summer, air flows out the tunnel, drawing radon-rich air from deep within the mine past the experimental area.

In order to keep radon levels in the dome area and water purification system below 100 Bq m−3, fresh air is continually pumped at approximately 10 m3/min from outside the mine which generates a slight over-pressure in the Super-Kamiokande experimental area to minimize the entry of ambient mine air. A &quot;Radon Hut&quot; (Rn Hut) was constructed near the Atotsu tunnel entrance to house equipment for the dome air system: a 40 hp air pump with 10 m3 min−1 /15 PSI pump capacity, air dehumidifier, carbon filter tanks, and control electronics. In autumn 1997, an extended intake air pipe was installed at a location approximately 25 m above the Atotsu tunnel entrance. This low level satisfies that goals of air quality so that carbon filter regeneration operations would no longer be required.

==Data processing==
Offline data processing is produced both in Kamioka and in the United States.

===In Kamioka===
The offline data processing system is located in Kenkyuto and is connected to Super-Kamiokande detector with 4 km FDDI optical fiber link. Data flow from online system is 450 kbytes s−1 on average, corresponding to 40 Gbytes day−1 or 14 Tbytes yr−1. Magnetic tapes are used in offline system to store data and most of the analysis is accomplished here. The offline processing system is designed platform-independent because different computer architectures are used for data analysis. Because of this, the data structures are based on ZEBRA bank system developed in CERN as well as the ZEBRA exchange system.

Event data from Super-Kamiokande online DAQ system basically contains a list of number of hit PMT, TDC, and ADC counts, GPS time-stamps, and other housekeeping data. For solar neutrino analysis, lowering the energy threshold is a constant goal, so it is a continual effort to improve the efficiency of reduction algorithms; however, changes in calibrations or reduction methods require reprocessing of earlier data. Typically, 10 Tbytes of raw data is processed every month so that a large amount of CPU power and high-speed I/O access to the raw data. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation processing is also necessary.

Offline system was designed to meet demand of all these: tape storage of a large database (14 Tbytes yr−1), stable semi-realtime processing, nearly continuous re-processing and Monte Carlo simulation. The computer system consists of three major sub-systems: the data server, the CPU farm, and the network at the end of Run I.

===In the United States===
A system dedicated to offsite offline data processing was set up at the Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York, to process raw data sent from Kamioka. Most of the reformatted raw data are copied from system facility in Kamioka. At Stony Brook, a system was set up for analysis and further processing. At Stony Brook the raw data were processed with a multi-tape DLT drive. The first-stage data reduction processes were done for the high-energy analysis and for the low-energy analysis.

The data reduction for the high-energy analysis was mainly for atmospheric neutrino events and proton decay search while the low-energy analysis was mainly for the solar neutrino events. The reduced data for the high-energy analysis was further filtered by other reduction processes and the resulting data were stored on disks. The reduced data for the low-energy were stored on DLT tapes and sent to University of California, Irvine, for further processing.

This offset analysis system continued for three years until their analysis chains were proved to produce equivalent results. Thus, in order to limit manpower, collaborations were concentrated to a single combined analysis

==Results==
In 1998, Super-K found first strong evidence of neutrino oscillation from the observation of muon neutrinos changed into tau-neutrinos.

SK has set limits on proton lifetime and other rare decays and neutrino properties. SK set a lower bound on protons decaying to kaons of 5.9 × 1033 yr

In January 2023, from data collected during the 1996–2018 period, new limits were reported by Super-Kamiokande for sub-GeV dark matter excluding the dark matter–nucleon elastic scattering cross section between formula_22 and formula_23 with masses from formula_24 to formula_25.

==In popular culture==
Super-Kamiokande is the subject of Andreas Gursky&#x27;s 2007 photograph &quot;Kamiokande&quot; and was featured in an episode of &quot;&quot;.

In September 2018, the detector was drained for maintenance, affording a team of Australian Broadcasting Corporation reporters the opportunity to obtain 4K resolution video from within the detection tank.

<text>Stimulated emission is the process by which an incoming photon of a specific frequency can interact with an excited atomic electron (or other excited molecular state), causing it to drop to a lower energy level. The liberated energy transfers to the electromagnetic field, creating a new photon with a frequency, polarization, and direction of travel that are all identical to the photons of the incident wave. This is in contrast to spontaneous emission, which occurs at a characteristic rate for each of the atoms/oscillators in the upper energy state regardless of the external electromagnetic field.

According to the American Physical Society, the first person to correctly predict the phenomenon of stimulated emission was Albert Einstein in a series of papers starting in 1916, culminating in what is now called the Einstein B Coefficient. Einstein&#x27;s work became the theoretical foundation of the maser and the laser. The process is identical in form to atomic absorption in which the energy of an absorbed photon causes an identical but opposite atomic transition: from the lower level to a higher energy level. In normal media at thermal equilibrium, absorption exceeds stimulated emission because there are more electrons in the lower energy states than in the higher energy states. However, when a population inversion is present, the rate of stimulated emission exceeds that of absorption, and a net optical amplification can be achieved. Such a gain medium, along with an optical resonator, is at the heart of a laser or maser.
Lacking a feedback mechanism, laser amplifiers and superluminescent sources also function on the basis of stimulated emission.

== Overview ==
Electrons and their interactions with electromagnetic fields are important in our understanding of chemistry and physics.
In the classical view, the energy of an electron orbiting an atomic nucleus is larger for orbits further from the nucleus of an atom. However, quantum mechanical effects force electrons to take on discrete positions in orbitals. Thus, electrons are found in specific energy levels of an atom, two of which are shown below:

When an electron absorbs energy either from light (photons) or heat (phonons), it receives that incident quantum of energy. But transitions are only allowed between discrete energy levels such as the two shown above.
This leads to emission lines and absorption lines.

When an electron is excited from a lower to a higher energy level, it is unlikely for it to stay that way forever.
An electron in an excited state may decay to a lower energy state which is not occupied, according to a particular time constant characterizing that transition. When such an electron decays without external influence, emitting a photon, that is called &quot;spontaneous emission&quot;. The phase and direction associated with the photon that is emitted is random. A material with many atoms in such an excited state may thus result in radiation which has a narrow spectrum (centered around one wavelength of light), but the individual photons would have no common phase relationship and would also emanate in random directions. This is the mechanism of fluorescence and thermal emission.

An external electromagnetic field at a frequency associated with a transition can affect the quantum mechanical state of the atom without being absorbed. As the electron in the atom makes a transition between two stationary states (neither of which shows a dipole field), it enters a transition state which does have a dipole field, and which acts like a small electric dipole, and this dipole oscillates at a characteristic frequency. In response to the external electric field at this frequency, the probability of the electron entering this transition state is greatly increased. Thus, the rate of transitions between two stationary states is increased beyond that of spontaneous emission. A transition from the higher to a lower energy state produces an additional photon with the same phase and direction as the incident photon; this is the process of stimulated emission.

== History ==
Stimulated emission was a theoretical discovery by Albert Einstein within the framework of the old quantum theory, wherein the emission is described in terms of photons that are the quanta of the EM field. Stimulated emission can also occur in classical models, without reference to photons or quantum-mechanics. (See also &quot;&quot;.) According to physics professor and director of the MIT-Harvard Center for Ultracold Atoms Daniel Kleppner, Einstein&#x27;s theory of radiation was ahead of its time and prefigures the modern theory of quantum electrodynamics and quantum optics by several decades.

== Mathematical model ==

Stimulated emission can be modelled mathematically by considering an atom that may be in one of two electronic energy states, a lower level state (possibly the ground state) (1) and an &quot;excited state&quot; (2), with energies &quot;E&quot;1 and &quot;E&quot;2 respectively.

If the atom is in the excited state, it may decay into the lower state by the process of spontaneous emission, releasing the difference in energies between the two states as a photon. The photon will have frequency &quot;ν&quot;0 and energy &quot;hν&quot;0, given by:
formula_1
where &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant.

Alternatively, if the excited-state atom is perturbed by an electric field of frequency &quot;ν&quot;0, it may emit an additional photon of the same frequency and in phase, thus augmenting the external field, leaving the atom in the lower energy state. This process is known as stimulated emission.

In a group of such atoms, if the number of atoms in the excited state is given by &quot;N&quot;2, the rate at which stimulated emission occurs is given by
formula_2
where the proportionality constant &quot;B&quot;21 is known as the &quot;Einstein B coefficient&quot; for that particular transition, and &quot;ρ&quot;(&quot;ν&quot;) is the radiation density of the incident field at frequency &quot;ν&quot;. The rate of emission is thus proportional to the number of atoms in the excited state &quot;N&quot;2, and to the density of incident photons.

At the same time, there will be a process of atomic absorption which &quot;removes&quot; energy from the field while raising electrons from the lower state to the upper state. Its rate is precisely the negative of the stimulated emission rate,
formula_3

The rate of absorption is thus proportional to the number of atoms in the lower state, &quot;N&quot;1. The B coefficients can be calculated using dipole approximation and time dependent perturbation theory in quantum mechanics as:
formula_4
where &quot;B&quot; corresponds to energy distribution in terms of frequency &quot;ν&quot;. The B coefficient may vary based on choice of energy distribution function used, however, the product of energy distribution function and its respective &quot;B&quot; coefficient remains same.

Einstein showed from the form of Planck&#x27;s law, that the coefficient for this transition must be identical to that for stimulated emission:
formula_5

Thus absorption and stimulated emission are reverse processes proceeding at somewhat different rates. Another way of viewing this is to look at the &quot;net&quot; stimulated emission or absorption viewing it as a single process. The net rate of transitions from &quot;E&quot;2 to &quot;E&quot;1 due to this combined process can be found by adding their respective rates, given above:
formula_6

Thus a net power is released into the electric field equal to the photon energy &quot;hν&quot; times this net transition rate. In order for this to be a positive number, indicating net stimulated emission, there must be more atoms in the excited state than in the lower level: formula_7. Otherwise there is net absorption and the power of the wave is reduced during passage through the medium. The special condition formula_8 is known as a population inversion, a rather unusual condition that must be effected in the gain medium of a laser.

The notable characteristic of stimulated emission compared to everyday light sources (which depend on spontaneous emission) is that the emitted photons have the same frequency, phase, polarization, and direction of propagation as the incident photons. The photons involved are thus mutually coherent. When a population inversion (formula_7) is present, therefore, optical amplification of incident radiation will take place.

Although energy generated by stimulated emission is always at the exact frequency of the field which has stimulated it, the above rate equation refers only to excitation at the particular optical frequency formula_10 corresponding to the energy of the transition. At frequencies offset from formula_10 the strength of stimulated (or spontaneous) emission will be decreased according to the so-called line shape.
Considering only homogeneous broadening affecting an atomic or molecular resonance, the spectral line shape function is described as a Lorentzian distribution
formula_12
where formula_13 is the full width at half maximum or FWHM bandwidth.

The peak value of the Lorentzian line shape occurs at the line center, formula_14. A line shape function can be normalized so that its value at formula_10 is unity; in the case of a Lorentzian we obtain
formula_16

Thus stimulated emission at frequencies away from formula_10 is reduced by this factor. In practice there may also be broadening of the line shape due to inhomogeneous broadening, most notably due to the Doppler effect resulting from the distribution of velocities in a gas at a certain temperature. This has a Gaussian shape and reduces the peak strength of the line shape function. In a practical problem the full line shape function can be computed through a convolution of the individual line shape functions involved. Therefore, optical amplification will add power to an incident optical field at frequency formula_18 at a rate given by
formula_19

== Stimulated emission cross section ==

The stimulated emission cross section is
formula_20
where
* &quot;A&quot;21 is the Einstein &quot;A&quot; coefficient,
* &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength in vacuum,
* &quot;n&quot; is the refractive index of the medium (dimensionless), and
* &quot;g&quot;′(&quot;ν&quot;) is the spectral line shape function.

== Optical amplification ==
Stimulated emission can provide a physical mechanism for optical amplification. If an external source of energy stimulates more than 50% of the atoms in the ground state to transition into the excited state, then what is called a population inversion is created. When light of the appropriate frequency passes through the inverted medium, the photons are either absorbed by the atoms that remain in the ground state or the photons stimulate the excited atoms to emit additional photons of the same frequency, phase, and direction. Since more atoms are in the excited state than in the ground state then an amplification of the input intensity results.

The population inversion, in units of atoms per cubic metre, is
: formula_21
where &quot;g&quot;1 and &quot;g&quot;2 are the degeneracies of energy levels 1 and 2, respectively.

=== Small signal gain equation ===
The intensity (in watts per square metre) of the stimulated emission is governed by the following differential equation:
: formula_22
as long as the intensity &quot;I&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is small enough so that it does not have a significant effect on the magnitude of the population inversion. Grouping the first two factors together, this equation simplifies as
: formula_23
where
: formula_24
is the &quot;small-signal gain coefficient&quot; (in units of radians per metre). We can solve the differential equation using separation of variables:
: formula_25

Integrating, we find:
: formula_26
or
: formula_27
where
: formula_28 is the optical intensity of the input signal (in watts per square metre).

=== Saturation intensity ===
The saturation intensity &quot;I&quot;S is defined as the input intensity at which the gain of the optical amplifier drops to exactly half of the small-signal gain. We can compute the saturation intensity as
: formula_29
where
: formula_30 is the Planck constant, and
: formula_31 is the saturation time constant, which depends on the spontaneous emission lifetimes of the various transitions between the energy levels related to the amplification.
: formula_18 is the frequency in Hz
The minimum value of formula_33 occurs on resonance, where the cross section formula_34 is the largest. This minimum value is:
: formula_35
For a simple two-level atom with a natural linewidth formula_36, the saturation time constant formula_37.

=== General gain equation ===
The general form of the gain equation, which applies regardless of the input intensity, derives from the general differential equation for the intensity &quot;I&quot; as a function of position &quot;z&quot; in the gain medium:
: formula_38
where formula_39 is saturation intensity. To solve, we first rearrange the equation in order to separate the variables, intensity &quot;I&quot; and position &quot;z&quot;:
: formula_40

Integrating both sides, we obtain
: formula_41
or
: formula_42

The gain &quot;G&quot; of the amplifier is defined as the optical intensity &quot;I&quot; at position &quot;z&quot; divided by the input intensity:
: formula_43

Substituting this definition into the prior equation, we find the general gain equation:
: formula_44

=== Small signal approximation ===
In the special case where the input signal is small compared to the saturation intensity, in other words,
: formula_45
then the general gain equation gives the small signal gain as
: formula_46
or
: formula_47
which is identical to the small signal gain equation (see above).

=== Large signal asymptotic behaviour ===

For large input signals, where
: formula_48
the gain approaches unity
: formula_49
and the general gain equation approaches a linear asymptote:
: formula_50

<doc id="28475" wikidata="Q39295" url="?curid=28475" title="Siberian Husky">
<text>The Siberian Husky is a breed of medium-sized working sled dog. The breed belongs to the Spitz genetic family. It is recognizable by its thickly furred double coat, erect triangular ears, and distinctive markings, and is smaller than the similar-looking Alaskan Malamute.

Siberian Huskies originated in Northeast Asia where they are bred by the Chukchi people as well as the Koryak, Yukaghir and Kamchadal people of Siberia for sled pulling and companionship. It is an active, energetic, resilient breed, whose ancestors lived in the extremely cold and harsh environment of the Siberian Arctic. William Goosak, a Russian fur trader, introduced them to Nome, Alaska, during the Nome Gold Rush, initially as sled dogs to work the mining fields and for expeditions through otherwise impassable terrain. Today, the Siberian Husky is typically kept as a house pet, though they are still frequently used as sled dogs by competitive and recreational mushers.

==Lineage==
In 2015, a DNA study indicated that the Siberian Husky, the Alaskan Malamute and the Alaskan husky share a close genetic relationship between each other and were related to Chukotka sled dogs from Siberia. They were separate to the two Inuit dogs, the Canadian Eskimo Dog and the Greenland Dog. In North America, the Siberian Husky and the Malamute both had maintained their Siberian lineage and had contributed significantly to the Alaskan husky, which was developed through crossing with European breeds. Siberian Huskies show a genetic affinity with historical East Siberian dogs and ancient Lake Baikal dogs, and can be traced to a lineage which is over 9,500 years old. A genomic sample of today&#x27;s Siberian Husky has emerged into four genetically distinct populations: show dogs, pet dogs, racing sled dogs and Seppala Siberian Huskies.

Several Arctic dog breeds, including the Siberian, show a significant genetic closeness with the now-extinct Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture. These breeds are associated with high latitudes – the Siberian Husky and Greenland Dog, also associated with arctic human populations and to a lesser extent, the Shar-Pei and Finnish Spitz. There is data to indicate admixture of between 1 and 3% between the Taymyr wolf population and the ancestral dog population of these four high-latitude breeds. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.

The Siberian Husky was originally developed by the Chukchi people of the Chukchi Peninsula in eastern Siberia. They were brought to Nome, Alaska in 1908 to serve as working sled dogs, and were eventually developed and used for sled dog racing.

==Description==
===Coat===

A Siberian Husky has a double coat that is thicker than that of most other dog breeds. It has two layers: a dense, finely wavy undercoat and a longer topcoat of thicker, straight guard hairs. It protects the dogs effectively against harsh Arctic winters, and also reflects heat in the summer. It is able to withstand temperatures as low as . The undercoat is often absent during shedding. Their thick coats require weekly grooming. An excessively long coat, sometimes referred to as a &quot;wooly&quot; or &quot;woolie&quot; coat, is considered a fault by the breed&#x27;s standard as it lacks the thicker protection of the standard coat&#x27;s guard hairs, obscures the dog&#x27;s clear-cut outline, causes quicker overheating during serious harness work, and becomes easily matted and encrusted with snow and ice.

Siberian Huskies come in a variety of colors and patterns, often with white paws and legs, facial markings, and tail tip. Example coat colors are black and white, copper-red and white, grey and white, pure white, and the rare &quot;agouti&quot; coat, though many individuals have blondish or piebald spotting. Some other individuals also have the &quot;saddle back&quot; pattern, in which black-tipped guard hairs are restricted to the saddle area while the head, haunches and shoulders are either light red or white. Striking masks, spectacles, and other facial markings occur in wide variety. All coat colors from black to pure white are allowed. Merle coat patterns are not permitted by the American Kennel Club (AKC) and The Kennel Club (KC). This pattern is often associated with health issues and impure breeding.

===Eyes===

The American Kennel Club describes the Siberian Husky&#x27;s eyes as &quot;an almond shape, moderately spaced and set slightly obliquely&quot;. The AKC breed standard is that eyes may be brown, blue or black; one of each or particoloured are acceptable (complete is heterochromia). These eye-color combinations are considered acceptable by the American Kennel Club. The parti-color does not affect the vision of the dog.

===Nose===
Show-quality dogs are preferred to have neither pointed nor square noses. The nose is black in gray dogs, tan in black dogs, liver in copper-colored dogs, and may be light tan in white dogs. In some instances, Siberian Huskies can exhibit what is called &quot;snow nose&quot; or &quot;winter nose&quot;. This condition is called hypopigmentation in animals. &quot;Snow nose&quot; is acceptable in the show ring.

===Tail===
Siberian Husky tails are heavily furred; these dogs will often curl up with their tails over their faces and noses in order to provide additional warmth. When curled up to sleep the Siberian Husky will cover its nose for warmth, often referred to as the &quot;Siberian Swirl&quot;. The AKC recommends the tail should be expressive, held low when the dog is relaxed, and curved upward in a &quot;sickle&quot; shape when excited or interested in something.

===Size===
The breed standard indicates that the males of the breed are ideally between tall at the withers and weighing between . Females are smaller, growing to between tall at the withers and weighing between . The people of Nome referred to Siberian Huskies as &quot;Siberian Rats&quot; due to their size of , versus the Alaskan Malamute&#x27;s size of .

===Behavior===
The Husky usually howls instead of barking. They have been described as escape artists, which can include digging under, chewing through, or even jumping over fences.

The ASPCA classifies the breed as good with children. It also states they exhibit high energy indoors, have special exercise needs, and may be destructive &quot;without proper care&quot;.

A fence is recommended for this breed as a pet, although some have been known to overcome fences as high as . Electric pet fencing may not be effective. They need the frequent companionship of people and other dogs, and their need to feel as part of a pack is very strong.

The character of the Siberian Husky is friendly and gentle. A study found an association with a gene in the breed and impulsivity, inattention, and high activity.

Siberian Huskies were ranked 77th out of 138 compared breeds for their intelligence by canine psychologist Stanley Coren. However, the rankings in Coren&#x27;s published work utilized only one of three defined forms of dog intelligence, &quot;Working and Obedience Intelligence&quot;, which focused on trainability—a dog&#x27;s ability to follow direction and commands in a direct context, specifically by trial judges in a controlled course setting.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 11.9 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. Health issues in the breed are mainly genetic, such as seizures and defects of the eye (juvenile cataracts, corneal dystrophy, canine glaucoma and progressive retinal atrophy) and congenital laryngeal paralysis. Hip dysplasia is not often found in this breed; however, as with many medium or larger-sized canines, it can occur. The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals currently has the Siberian Husky ranked 155th out of a possible 160 breeds at risk for hip dysplasia, with only two percent of tested Siberian Huskies showing dysplasia.

Siberian Huskies used for sled racing may also be prone to other ailments, such as gastric disease, bronchitis or bronchopulmonary ailments (&quot;ski asthma&quot;), and gastric erosions or ulcerations.

The Siberian Husky is one of the more commonly affected breeds for X-linked progressive retinal atrophy. The condition is caused by a mutation in the RPGR gene in the breed.

Modern Siberian Huskies registered in the US are almost entirely the descendants of the 1930 Siberia imports and of Leonhard Seppala&#x27;s dogs, particularly Togo. The limited number of registered foundational dogs has led to some discussion about their vulnerability to the founder effect.

==History==
=== Prehistoric (prior to 1890s) ===
The Chukotka Sled Dog is considered the progenitor to the Siberian Husky. Developed by the Chukchi people of Russia, Chukotka sled dog teams have been used since prehistoric times to pulls sleds in harsh conditions, such as hunting sea mammals on oceanic pack ice.

=== Origination of Name and Split from Chukotka Sled Dogs (1890s–1930s) ===
From the 1890s to the 1930s, sled dogs from northeast Siberia and especially Chukotka sled dogs were actively imported in vast numbers to Alaska, to transport gold miners to the Yukon, first as part of the Klondike Gold Rush, then later the &quot;All-Alaska Sweepstakes&quot;, a 408-mile (657-km) distance dog sled race from Nome, to Candle, and back. At this time, &quot;Esquimaux&quot; or &quot;Eskimo&quot; was a common pejorative term for native Arctic inhabitants with many dialectal permutations including Uskee, Uskimay and Huskemaw. Thus dogs used by Arctic people were the dogs of the Huskies, the Huskie&#x27;s dogs, and eventually simply the husky dogs. Canadian and American settlers, not well versed on Russian geography, would distinguish the Chukotka imports by referring to them as Siberian huskies as Chukotka is part of Siberia.

Smaller, faster and more enduring than the 100- to 120-pound (45- to 54-kg) freighting dogs then in general use, they immediately dominated the Sweepstakes race. Leonhard Seppala, the foremost breeder of Siberian sled dogs of the time, participated in competitions from 1909 to the mid-1920s with a number of championships to his name.

On February 3, 1925, Gunnar Kaasen was the final musher in the 1925 serum run to Nome to deliver diphtheria serum from Nenana, over 600 miles to Nome. This was a group effort by several sled dog teams and mushers, with the longest (264 miles or 422 km) and most dangerous segment of the run covered by Leonhard Seppala and his sled team lead dog Togo. The event is depicted in the 2019 film &quot;Togo&quot;. A measure of this is also depicted in the 1995 animated film &quot;Balto&quot;; the name of Gunnar Kaasen&#x27;s lead dog in his sled team was Balto, although unlike the real dog, Balto the character was portrayed as a wolf-dog in the film. In honor of this lead dog, a bronze statue was erected at Central Park in New York City. The plaque upon it is inscribed, Dedicated to the indomitable spirit of the sled dogs that relayed antitoxin six hundred miles over rough ice, across treacherous waters, through Arctic blizzards from Nenana to the relief of stricken Nome in the winter of 1925. Endurance · Fidelity · Intelligence
Siberian huskies gained mass popularity with the story of the &quot;Great Race of Mercy&quot;, the 1925 serum run to Nome, featuring Balto and Togo. Although Balto is considered the more famous, being the dog that delivered the serum to Nome after running the final 53-mile leg, it was Togo who made the longest run of the relay, guiding his musher Leonhard Seppala on a 261-mile journey that included crossing the deadly Norton Sound to Golovin, and who ultimately became a foundation dog for the Siberian Husky breed, through his progeny Toto, Molinka, Kingeak, Ammoro, Sepp III, and Togo II.

In 1930, exportation of the dogs from Siberia was halted. The same year saw recognition of the Siberian Husky by the American Kennel Club. Nine years later, the breed was first registered in Canada. The United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1938 as the &quot;Arctic Husky&quot;, changing the name to Siberian Husky in 1991. Seppala owned a kennel in Alaska before moving to New England, where he became partners with Elizabeth Ricker. The two co-owned the Poland Springs kennel and began to race and exhibit their dogs all over the Northeast. The kennel was sold to Canadian Harry Wheeler in 1931, following Seppala&#x27;s return to Alaska

The breed&#x27;s foundation stock per records and studbooks consists of:Kree Vanka (Male, 1930 Siberia Import)

Tserko (Male, 1930 Siberia Import),

Tosca (Female, Harry x Kolyma)

Duke (Male, also known as Chapman&#x27;s Duke, reportedly Ici x Wanda)

Tanta of Alyeska (Female, Tuck x Toto)

Sigrid III of Foxstand (Female, Chenuk x Molinka)

Smokey of Seppala (Male, Kingeak x Pearl)

Sepp III (Male, Togo x Dolly)

Smoky (Male, unknown parentage)

Dushka (Female, Bonzo x Nanuk)

Kabloona (Female, Ivan x Duchess)

Rollinsford Nina of Marilyn (Female, Kotlik x Nera of Marilyn)As the breed was beginning to come to prominence, in 1933 Navy Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd brought about 50 Siberian Huskies with him on an expedition in which he hoped to journey around the 16,000-mile coast of Antarctica. Many of the dogs were bred and trained at Chinook Kennels in New Hampshire, owned by Eva Seeley. Called Operation Highjump, the historic trek proved the worth of the Siberian Husky due to its compact size and great speed. Siberian Huskies also served in the United States Army&#x27;s Arctic Search and Rescue Unit of the Air Transport Command during World War II. Their popularity was sustained into the 21st century. They were ranked 16th among American Kennel Club registrants in 2012, rising to 14th place in 2013.

=== 1940s–present ===
Huskies were extensively used as sled dogs by the British Antarctic Survey in Antarctica between 1945 and 1994. A bronze monument to all of BAS&#x27;s dog teams is outside its Cambridge headquarters, with a plaque listing all the dogs&#x27; names.

In 1960, the US Army undertook a project to construct an under the ice facility for defense and space research, Camp Century, part of Project Iceworm involved a 150+ crew who also brought with them an unofficial mascot, a Siberian Husky named Mukluk.

Due to their high popularity combining with their high physical and mental needs, Siberians are abandoned or surrendered to shelters at high rates by new owners who do not research them fully and find themselves unable to care for them. Many decide on the breed for their looks and mythos in pop culture, and purchase pups from backyard breeders or puppy mills who do not have breeder-return contracts that responsible breeders will, designed to keep the breed out of shelters.

Sled dogs that were bred and kept by the Chukchi tribes of Siberia were thought to have gone extinct, but Benedict Allen, writing for &quot;Geographical&quot; magazine in 2006 after visiting the region, reported their survival. His description of the breeding practiced by the Chukchi mentions selection for obedience, endurance, amiable disposition, and sizing that enabled families to support them without undue difficulty.

== Traditional use and other activities ==

Originally, huskies were used as sled dogs in the polar regions. One can differentiate huskies from other dog types by their fast pulling-style. Modern racing huskies (also known as Alaskan huskies) represent an ever-changing crossbreed of the fastest dogs. Humans use huskies in sled-dog racing. Various companies have marketed tourist treks with dog sledges for adventure travelers in snow regions. Huskies are also kept as pets, and groups work to find new pet homes for retired racing and adventure-trekking dogs.

Many huskies, especially Siberian Huskies, are considered working dogs and are often high-energy. Exercise is extremely important for the physical and mental health of these kinds of dogs and it can also prompt a strong bond between the owner and dog. Since many owners now have huskies as pets in settings that are not ideal for sledding, other activities have been found that are good for the dog and fun for the owner.

* Rally Obedience: Owners guide their dogs through a course of difficult exercises side by side. There are typically 10 to 20 signs per course and involve different commands or tricks.
* Agility Training: A fast-paced obstacle course that deals with speed and concentration. Dogs race the clock to complete the course correctly.
* Skijoring is an alternative to sled pulling. The owner would be on skis while the dog would pull via a rope connected between the two.
*Dog hiking is an alternative for owners who live near or are able to travel to a trail. The owner travels with their dogs along trails in the wilderness. This activity allows the owner and dog to gain exercise without using the huskies&#x27; strong sense of pulling. Some companies make hiking equipment especially for dogs in which they may carry their own gear, including water, food, and bowls for each.
*Carting, also known as dryland mushing or sulky driving, is an urban alternative to dog sledding. Here, the dog can pull a cart that contains either supplies or an individual. This is also an acceptable way to use a dog&#x27;s natural inclination to pull in an effective way. These carts can be bought or handmade by the individual.
*Bikejoring is an activity where the owner bikes along with their dog while they are attached to their bike through a harness which keeps both the dog and owner safe. The dog or team of dogs can be attached to a towline to also pull the biker.

==In culture==

*A bronze statue of Balto that has been displayed in New York City&#x27;s Central Park since 1925 is one of the park&#x27;s enduringly popular features.
*&quot;The Twilight Saga&quot;, which features werewolves and the television series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; spurred a huge uptick in demand for Siberian Huskies as pets, followed by a steep increase of their numbers at public shelters. Even though the animal actors were &quot;not&quot; Siberian Huskies, people were acquiring Siberian Huskies because they looked similar to the fictional direwolf characters depicted in the show. Two of the show&#x27;s stars pleaded with the public to stop acquiring the dogs without first researching the breed.
*The phrase &quot;three dog night&quot;, meaning it is so cold you would need three dogs in bed with you to keep warm, originated with the Chukchi people of Siberia, who kept the Siberian husky landrace dog that became the modern purebred breed called the Siberian Husky.
*The World War II Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 was called &quot;Operation Husky&quot;.
*Several purebred Siberian Huskies portrayed Diefenbaker, the &quot;half-wolf&quot; companion to RCMP Constable Benton Fraser, in the CBS/Alliance Atlantis TV series &quot;Due South&quot;.
*Siberian Huskies are the mascots of the athletic teams of several schools and colleges, including St. Cloud State University (St. Cloud State Huskies, Blizzard), Northern Illinois University (Northern Illinois Huskies, Victor), the University of Connecticut (Connecticut Huskies, Jonathan), Northeastern University (Northeastern Huskies, Paws), the Michigan Technological University (Michigan Tech Huskies, Blizzard), University of Washington (Washington Huskies, Harry), Houston Baptist University (Houston Baptist Huskies, Kiza the Husky), and Saint Mary&#x27;s University (Saint Mary&#x27;s Huskies) and George Brown College (Toronto, Ontario).

<text>Skiing is the use of skis to glide on snow for basic transport, a recreational activity, or a competitive winter sport. Many types of competitive skiing events are recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation (FIS).

==History==
Skiing has a history of almost five millennia. Although modern skiing has evolved from beginnings in Scandinavia, it may have been practiced more than 100 centuries ago in the Altai Mountains, according to an interpretation of ancient paintings. However, this continues to be debated.

The word &quot;ski&quot; comes from the Old Norse word &quot;skíð&quot; which means to &quot;split piece of wood or firewood&quot;.

Asymmetrical skis were used in northern Finland and Sweden until at least the late 19th century. On one foot, the skier wore a long straight non-arching ski for sliding, and a shorter ski was worn on the other foot for kicking. The underside of the short ski was either plain or covered with animal skin to aid this use, while the long ski supporting the weight of the skier was treated with animal fat in a similar manner to modern ski waxing.

Early skiers used one long pole or spear. The first description of a skier with two ski poles dates to 1741.

Troops in continental Europe were equipped with skis by 1747, and into the 21st century many nations continue to equip and train specialized troops for ski warfare.

Skiing was primarily used for transport until the mid-19th century but, since then, it has also become a recreation and sport. Military ski races were held in Norway during the 18th century, and ski warfare was studied in the late 18th century. As equipment evolved and ski lifts were developed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, two main genres of skiing emerged—Alpine (downhill) skiing and Nordic skiing. The main difference between the two is the type of ski binding (the way in which the ski boots are attached to the skis).

==Types==
===Alpine===

Also called &quot;downhill skiing&quot;, Alpine skiing typically takes place on a piste at a ski resort. It is characterized by fixed-heel bindings that attach at both the toe and the heel of the skier&#x27;s boot. Ski lifts, including chairlifts, bring skiers up the slope. Backcountry skiing can be accessed by helicopter, snowcat, hiking and snowmobile. Facilities at resorts can include night skiing, après-ski, and glade skiing under the supervision of the ski patrol and the ski school. Alpine skiing branched off from the older Nordic type of skiing around the 1920s when the advent of ski lifts meant that it was no longer necessary to climb back uphill. Alpine equipment has specialized to the point where it can now only be used with the help of lifts. Alpine Touring setups use specialized bindings which are switchable between locked and free-heel modes. Climbing skins are temporarily attached to the bottom of alpine skis to give them traction on snow. This permits Nordic style uphill and back-country travel on alpine skis. For downhill travel, the heels are locked and the skins are removed.

===Nordic===
The Nordic disciplines include cross-country skiing and ski jumping, which both use bindings that attach at the toes of the skier&#x27;s boots but not at the heels. Cross-country skiing may be practiced on groomed trails or in undeveloped backcountry areas. Ski jumping is practiced in certain areas that are reserved exclusively for ski jumping.

===Telemark===

Telemark skiing is a ski turning technique and FIS-sanctioned discipline, which is named after the Telemark region of Norway. It uses equipment similar to Nordic skiing, where the ski bindings are attached only at the toes of the ski boots, allowing the skier&#x27;s heel to be raised throughout the turn. However, the skis themselves are often the same width as Alpine skis.

==Competition==
The following skiing disciplines are sanctioned by the FIS. Many have their own world cups and are included in the Winter Olympic Games.
* Cross-country – Encompasses a variety of formats for cross-country skiing races over courses of varying lengths. Races occur on homologated, groomed courses designed to support classic (in-track) and free-style events, where skate skiing may be employed. The main competitions are the FIS Cross-Country World Cup and the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships (held only in odd-numbered years), and various cross-country skiing events have been incorporated into the Winter Olympics since its inception in 1924. The discipline also incorporates: cross-country ski marathon events, sanctioned by the Worldloppet Ski Federation; cross-country ski-orienteering events, sanctioned by the International Orienteering Federation; and biathlon, a combination of cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. Paralympic cross-country skiing and paralympic biathlon are both included in the Winter Paralympic Games.
* Ski jumping – Contested at the FIS Ski Jumping World Cup, the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships (odd-numbered years only), the FIS Ski Jumping Grand Prix, and the FIS Ski Flying World Championships. Ski jumping has also been a regular Olympic discipline at every Winter Games since 1924.
* Nordic combined – A combination of cross-country skiing and ski jumping, this discipline is contested at the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup, the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships (odd-numbered years only), and at the Winter Olympics.
* Alpine skiing – Includes downhill, slalom, giant slalom, super giant slalom (super-G), and para-alpine events. There are also combined events where the competitors must complete one run of each event, for example; the Super Combined event consists of one run of super-G and one run of slalom skiing. The dual slalom event, where racers ski head-to-head, was invented in 1941 and has been a competitive event since 1960. Alpine skiing is contested at the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup, the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships (held only in odd-numbered years), and the Winter Olympics. Para-alpine skiing is contested at the World Para Alpine Skiing Championships (odd-numbered years) and the Winter Paralympics.
* Speed skiing – Dating from 1898, with official records beginning in 1932 with an run by Leo Gasperi, this became an FIS discipline in the 1960s. It is contested at the FIS Speed Ski World Cup, and was demonstrated at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville.
* Freestyle skiing – Includes mogul skiing, aerials, ski cross, half-pipe, and slopestyle. The main freestyle competitions are the FIS Freestyle Skiing World Cup and the FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships (held in odd-numbered years). The discipline was first demonstrated at the 1988 Winter Olympics and was added to the Olympic programme in 1992. It became an Olympic sport in the 2014 Sochi Olympic games when the Slope-style and Half pipe events were introduced.
* Telemark – Named after the Telemark region of Norway, this discipline combines elements of Alpine and Nordic skiing. A relatively new competitive sport, Telemark racing is contested at the FIS Telemark World Cup and the FIS Telemark World Championships.
* Grass skiing – Originally developed as an alpine skiing training method, skiing on grass has become established as a skiing discipline in its own right. It is contested at the FIS Grass Skiing World Cup and the FIS Grass Ski World Championships.

==Equipment==

Equipment used in skiing includes:
* Skis, which may have skins applied or be textured for uphill traction or wax applied for minimizing sliding friction. Twin-tip skis are also designed to move forwards or backwards.
* Boots and bindings
* Poles
* Helmets
* Ski suits
* Ski goggles
* Skiing gloves
* Ski masks

==Technique==
Technique has evolved along with ski technology and ski geometry. Early techniques included the telemark turn, the stem, the stem Christie, snowplough, and parallel turn.

New parabolic designs like the Elan SCX have enabled the more modern carve turn.

==On other surfaces==
Originally and primarily an outdoor winter sport on snow, skiing is also practiced on synthetic &quot;dry&quot; ski slopes, on sand, indoors and with ski simulators. With appropriate equipment, grass skiing and roller skiing are other alternatives which are not performed on snow.

<text>The Spice Girls are an English girl group formed in 1994, consisting of Mel B (&quot;Scary Spice&quot;); Melanie C (&quot;Sporty Spice&quot;); Emma Bunton (&quot;Baby Spice&quot;); Geri Halliwell (&quot;Ginger Spice&quot;); and Victoria Beckham (&quot; Spice&quot;). They have sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling girl group of all time. With their &quot;girl power&quot; mantra, the Spice Girls redefined the girl-group concept by targeting a young female fanbase. They led the teen pop resurgence of the 1990s, were a major part of the Cool Britannia era, and became popular culture icons of the decade.

The Spice Girls were formed by Heart Management, who held auditions to create a girl group to compete with the British boy bands popular at the time. After leaving Heart, the Spice Girls hired Simon Fuller as their manager and signed with Virgin Records. They released their debut single, &quot;Wannabe&quot;, in 1996, which reached number one on the charts of 37 countries. Their debut album, &quot;Spice&quot; (1996), sold more than 23 million copies worldwide, becoming the best-selling album by a female group in history. It also produced three more number-one singles: &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, &quot;2 Become 1&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot;/&quot;Mama&quot;. Their second album, &quot;Spiceworld&quot; (1997), sold more than 14 million copies worldwide. The Spice Girls achieved three number-one singles from the album with &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot;, &quot;Too Much&quot; and &quot;Viva Forever&quot;. Both albums encapsulated the group&#x27;s dance-pop style and message of female empowerment, with vocal and songwriting contributions shared equally by the members.

In 1997, the Spice Girls made their live concert debut and released a feature film, &quot;Spice World&quot;, both to commercial success. In 1998, the group embarked on the Spiceworld Tour, which was attended by an estimated 2.1 million people worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing concert tour by a female group. Halliwell left the Spice Girls mid-tour in May 1998. Following a number-one single with &quot;Goodbye&quot; (1998) and a successful 1999 concert tour, the Spice Girls released their R&amp;B-influenced third album, &quot;Forever&quot;, in 2000. It featured their ninth number one single with &quot;Holler&quot;/&quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot;, setting a record for most UK number ones by a girl group of all time. By the end of 2000, the Spice Girls entered a hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers. Since then, they have reunited for a performance at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony and for two concert tours: the Return of the Spice Girls from 2007 to 2008 as a five-piece and the Spice World — 2019 UK Tour, without Beckham. Both tours won the &quot;Billboard&quot; Live Music Award for highest-grossing engagements, making the Spice Girls the top touring all-female group from 1998 to 2020.

The Spice Girls have won five Brit Awards, three American Music Awards, four &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, three MTV Europe Music Awards and one MTV Video Music Award. In 2000, they became the youngest recipients of the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. Notable elements of the Spice Girls&#x27; symbolism include Halliwell&#x27;s Union Jack dress and the nicknames that were given to each member of the group by the British press. Numerous endorsement deals and merchandise brought the group additional success, with a global gross income estimated at $500–800 million by May 1998. According to the &quot;Music Week&quot; writer Paul Gorman, their media exposure helped usher in an era of celebrity obsession in pop culture.

==History==
===1994–1995: Formation and early years===

In the early 1990s, Bob Herbert and Chris Herbert, the father-and-son duo of Heart Management, decided to create a girl group to compete with the boy bands who dominated UK pop music at the time. With the financier Chic Murphy, they envisioned an act comprising &quot;five strikingly different girls&quot; who would each appeal to a different audience. In February 1994, Heart Management placed an advertisement in the trade paper &quot;The Stage&quot; asking for singers to audition for an all-female pop band at London&#x27;s Danceworks studios. Approximately 400 women attended the audition on 4 March 1994. They were placed in groups of 10 and danced a routine to &quot;Stay&quot; by Eternal, followed by solo auditions in which they performed songs of their choice.

After several weeks of deliberation, Victoria Adams, Melanie Brown, Melanie Coloma and Michelle Stephenson were among a dozen or so women who advanced to a second round of auditions in April. Suffering from a tonsillitis, Melanie Chisholm couldn&#x27;t be present at the second round of auditions. However, after said auditions, Melanie Coloma was let go by the Herberts, who called Melanie C to replace her, after Geri Halliwell persuaded the Herberts to let her attend the next round of auditions. A week after the second audition, Adams, Brown, Halliwell and Stephenson were asked to attend a recall at Nomis Studios in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, performing &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered I&#x27;m Yours&quot; on their own and as a group. Chisholm was also invited. The five women were selected for a band initially named Touch.

The group moved into a three-bedroom house in Maidenhead, Berkshire, and spent most of 1994 practising songs written for them by Bob Herbert&#x27;s long-time associates John Thirkell and Erwin Keiles. According to Stephenson, the songs were aimed at a very young audience, and none were later used by the Spice Girls. During these first months, the group worked on demos at South Hill Park Recording Studios in Bracknell with the producer and studio owner Michael Sparkes and the songwriter and arranger Tim Hawes. They were also tasked with choreographing their own dance routines, which they worked on at Trinity Studios in Knaphill, near Woking, Surrey. A few months into the training, Stephenson was fired for a perceived lack of commitment. Heart Management turned to the group&#x27;s vocal coach, Pepi Lemer, to find a replacement. After Lemer&#x27;s first recommendation declined the offer, Lemer recommended her former pupil Emma Bunton, who auditioned for the Herberts and joined as the fifth member.

As their training continued, the group performed small showcases for a few of Heart Management&#x27;s associates. In one performance, they added a rap section they had written to one of Thirkell and Keiles&#x27; songs. Keiles was furious with the changes and insisted they learn to write songs properly. The group began professional songwriting lessons; during one session, they wrote a song called &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot; with Hawes, which inspired them to change their name to Spice.

==== Signing with Virgin Records ====
By late 1994, the group felt insecure, as they still did not have an official contract with Heart Management and were frustrated with the management team&#x27;s direction. They persuaded Herbert to set up a showcase performance in front of industry writers, producers and A&amp;R men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios, where they received an &quot;overwhelmingly positive&quot; reaction. The Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for them. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the Nomis showcase, all five members refused to sign the contracts on legal advice from, among others, Adams&#x27;s father. In January, the group began songwriting sessions with Richard Stannard, whom they had impressed at the showcase, and his partner Matt Rowe. During these sessions the songs &quot;Wannabe&quot; and &quot;2 Become 1&quot; were written.

In March 1995, the group left Heart Management, feeling Heart was unwilling to listen to their ideas. To ensure they kept control of their work, they allegedly stole the master recordings of their discography from the management offices. The next day, the group tracked down the Sheffield-based songwriter Eliot Kennedy, who had been present at the Nomis showcase, and persuaded him to work with them. Through contacts they had made at the showcase, they were also introduced to the Absolute production team. With Kennedy and Absolute&#x27;s help, the group spent the next several weeks writing and recording demos for the majority of the songs that would be released on their debut album, including &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot;. Their demos caught the attention of Simon Fuller of 19 Entertainment, who signed them to his management company in May 1995.

By this point, industry buzz around Spice had grown and major record labels in London and Los Angeles were keen to sign them. After a bidding war, they signed a five-album deal with Virgin Records in July 1995. Fuller took them on an extensive promotional tour in Los Angeles, where they met with studio executives in the hopes of securing film and television opportunities. Their name was changed to the Spice Girls as a rapper was already using the name Spice. The new name was chosen as industry people often referred to them derisively as &quot;the Spice girls&quot;. They continued to write and record tracks for their debut album.

===1996–1997: Breakthrough===

On 8 July 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut single &quot;Wannabe&quot; in the United Kingdom. In the weeks before the release, the music video received a trial airing on music channel the Box. It was an instant hit and was aired up to seventy times a week at its peak. After the video was released, the Spice Girls had their first live broadcast TV slot on LWT&#x27;s &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot;. Earlier in May, they had conducted their first music press interview with Paul Gorman, the contributing editor of trade paper &quot;Music Week&quot;, at Virgin Records&#x27; Paris headquarters. His piece recognised that the Spice Girls were about to institute a change in the charts away from Britpop and towards out-and-out pop. He wrote: &quot;Just when boys with guitars threaten to rule pop life—Damon&#x27;s all over &quot;Smash Hits&quot;, Ash are big in &quot;Big!&quot; and Liam can&#x27;t move for tabloid frenzy—an all-girl, in-yer-face pop group have arrived with enough sass to burst that rockist bubble.&quot; &quot;Wannabe&quot; entered the UK Singles Chart at number three before spending the next seven weeks at number one. The song proved to be a global hit, hitting number one in 37 countries, including four consecutive weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US, and becoming not only the best-selling debut single by an all-female group but also the best-selling single by an all-female group of all time.

Following the release of &quot;Wannabe&quot;, an article in &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; magazine identified each Spice Girl with a unique nickname based on their personalities. Though unintended, the use of these nicknames became widespread and they were later adopted globally. Riding a wave of publicity and hype, the group released their next singles in Europe. In October, &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot; was released topping the charts for two weeks. &quot;2 Become 1&quot; was released in December, becoming their first Christmas number one and selling 462,000 copies in its first week, making it the fastest-selling single of the year. The two tracks continued the group&#x27;s remarkable sales, giving them three of the top five best-selling songs of 1996 in the UK. In November 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut album, &quot;Spice&quot;, in Europe. The success was unprecedented and drew comparisons to Beatlemania, leading the press to dub it &quot;Spicemania&quot; and the group the &quot;Fab Five&quot;. In seven weeks &quot;Spice&quot; had sold 1.8 million copies in Britain alone, making the Spice Girls the fastest-selling British act since the Beatles. In total, the album sold over 3 million copies in Britain, the best-selling album of all time in the UK by a female group, certified ten times platinum, and reached number one for fifteen non-consecutive weeks. In Europe the album became the best-selling album of 1997 and was certified 8× Platinum by the IFPI for sales in excess of 8 million copies.

That same month, the Spice Girls attracted a crowd of 500,000 when they switched on the Christmas lights in Oxford Street, London. At the same time, Fuller started to set up multi-million dollar sponsorship deals for the Spice Girls with Pepsi, Walkers, Impulse, Cadbury and Polaroid. The group ended 1996 winning three trophies at the &quot;Smash Hits&quot; awards at the London Arena, including best video for &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;.

==== International success ====
In January 1997, &quot;Wannabe&quot; was released in the United States. It proved to be a catalyst in helping the Spice Girls break into the US market when it debuted on the Hot 100 Chart at number eleven. At the time, this was the highest-ever debut by a non-American act, beating the previous record held by the Beatles for &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, and the joint highest entry for a debut act alongside Alanis Morissette&#x27;s &quot;Ironic&quot;. &quot;Wannabe&quot; reached number one in the US for four weeks. In February, &quot;Spice&quot; was released in the US, and became the best-selling album of 1997 in the US, peaking at number one, and was certified 7× Platinum by the RIAA for sales in excess of 7.4 million copies. The album was also included in the Top 100 Albums of All Time list by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) based on US sales. In total, the album sold over 23 million copies worldwide becoming the best-selling album in pop music history by an all-female group.
Later that month, the Spice Girls performed &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot; to open the 1997 Brit Awards, with Geri Halliwell wearing a Union Jack mini-dress that became one of pop history&#x27;s most famed outfits. At the ceremony, the group won two Brit Awards; Best British Video for &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot; and Best British Single for &quot;Wannabe&quot;. In March 1997, a double A-side of &quot;Mama&quot;/&quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot; was released in Europe, the last from &quot;Spice&quot;, which once again saw them at number one, making the Spice Girls the first group since the Jackson 5 to have four consecutive number one hits.

&quot;Girl Power!&quot;, the Spice Girls&#x27; first book, was launched later that month at Virgin Megastore. It sold out its initial print run of 200,000 copies within a day, and was eventually translated into more than 20 languages. In April, &quot;One Hour of Girl Power&quot; was released; it sold 500,000 copies in the UK between April and June to become the best-selling pop video ever, and was eventually certified thirteen times platinum. In May, &quot;Spice World&quot;, a film starring the group, was announced by the Spice Girls at the Cannes Film Festival. The group also performed their first live UK show for the Prince&#x27;s Trust benefit concert. At the show, they breached royal protocol when Brown and then Halliwell planted kisses on Prince Charles&#x27; cheeks and pinched his bottom, causing controversy. That same month, Virgin released &quot;Spice Girls Present... The Best Girl Power Album... Ever!&quot;, a multi-artist compilation album compiled by the group. It reached number two on the UK Compilation Chart and was certified Gold by the BPI. At the Ivor Novello Awards, &quot;Wannabe&quot; won the awards for International Hit of the Year and Best-Selling British Single.

&quot;Spice World&quot; began filming in June and wrapped in August. The film was to be set to the songs from the group&#x27;s second studio album, but no songs had been written when filming began. The group thus had to do all the songwriting and recording at the same time as they were filming &quot;Spice World&quot;, resulting in a gruelling schedule that left them exhausted. Among the songs that were written during this period was &quot;Stop&quot;, the lyrics for which cover the group&#x27;s frustrations with being overworked by their management.

In September, the Spice Girls performed &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot; at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, and won Best Dance Video for &quot;Wannabe&quot;. The MTV Awards came five days after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, with tributes paid to her throughout the ceremony. Chisholm stated, &quot;We&#x27;d like to dedicate this award to Princess Diana, who is a great loss to our country.&quot; At the 1997 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, the group won four awards for New Artist of the Year, &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Singles Group of the Year, &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Group of the Year and &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 Album of the Year for &quot;Spice&quot;.

==== &quot;Spiceworld&quot; and feature film ====

In October 1997, the Spice Girls released the first single from their second album, &quot;Spiceworld,&quot; &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot;. It entered the UK Singles Chart at number one, making it the group&#x27;s fifth consecutive number-one single. That same month, the group performed their first live major concert to 40,000 fans in Istanbul, Turkey. Later, they launched the Royal British Legion&#x27;s Poppy Appeal, then travelled to South Africa to meet Nelson Mandela, who announced, &quot;These are my heroes.&quot;

In November, the Spice Girls released &quot;Spiceworld&quot;. It set a new record for the fastest-selling album when it shipped seven million copies over the course of two weeks. Gaining favourable reviews, the album went on to sell over 10 million copies in Europe, Canada, and the United States combined, and 14 million copies worldwide.

Criticised in the United States for releasing the album just nine months after their debut there, which gave the group two simultaneous Top 10 albums in the &quot;Billboard&quot; album charts, and suffering from over-exposure at home, the Spice Girls began to experience a media backlash. They were criticised for their number of sponsorship deals—more than 20—and their chart positions declined. Nevertheless, the Spice Girls remained the best-selling pop group of both 1997 and 1998.

On 7 November 1997, the Spice Girls performed &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; at the MTV Europe Music Awards and won the Best Group award. The morning of the performance, they fired Fuller and began managing themselves. To ensure a smooth transition, Halliwell allegedly stole a mobile phone from Fuller&#x27;s assistant that contained the group&#x27;s schedule and Fuller&#x27;s business contacts. The firing was front-page news around the world. Many commentators speculated that Fuller had been the mastermind behind the group, and that the Spice Girls had lost their impetus and direction.

Later in November, the Spice Girls became the first pop group to host ITV&#x27;s &quot;An Audience with...&quot; Their show was watched by 11.8 million viewers in the UK, one fifth of the population. In December 1997, the second single from &quot;Spiceworld&quot;, &quot;Too Much&quot;, was released, becoming the Spice Girls&#x27; second Christmas number one and their sixth consecutive number-one UK single. That month, the Spice Girls launched a feature-length film, &quot;Spice World&quot;. The world premiere, at the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square, London, was attended by celebrities including Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince Harry. The film was a commercial success but received poor reviews. The Spice Girls ended 1997 as the year&#x27;s most played artist on American radio.

=== 1998: Spiceworld tour and Halliwell&#x27;s departure ===
In January 1998, the Spice Girls attended the US premiere of &quot;Spice World&quot; at the Mann&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. At the 1998 American Music Awards a few days later, they won the awards for Favorite Album, Favorite New Artist and Favorite Group in the pop/rock category. In February, they won a special award for overseas success at the 1998 Brit Awards, with combined sales of more than 45 million albums and singles worldwide. That night, the group performed their next single, &quot;Stop&quot;, their first not to reach number one in the UK, entering at number two. On 24 February 1998, the Spice Girls embarked on the Spiceworld Tour, starting in Dublin, Ireland, before moving to mainland Europe and North America and returning to the UK for two performances at Wembley Stadium. Later that year, the Spice Girls sang on the official England World Cup song &quot;(How Does It Feel to Be) On Top of the World&quot;, their last song with Halliwell until 2007.

On 31 May 1998, Halliwell announced her departure from the Spice Girls through her solicitor. The announcement was preceded by days of frenzied press speculation after Halliwell missed two concerts in Norway and was absent from a performance on &quot;The National Lottery Draws&quot;. Halliwell first cited creative differences, and later said that she was suffering from exhaustion and disillusionment. Rumours of a power struggle with Brown circulated in the press. Halliwell&#x27;s departure shocked fans and became one of the biggest entertainment news stories of the year, making news international headlines. The four remaining members were adamant that the group would carry on.

The North American leg of the Spiceworld Tour went on as planned, beginning in West Palm Beach, Florida, on 15 June, and grossing $93.6 million over 40 sold-out performances. The tour was attended by an estimated 2.1 million people over 97 shows with an estimated gross of $220-$250 million, the highest-grossing concert tour by a female group. It was accompanied by a documentary film, &quot;Spice Girls in America: A Tour Story&quot;. &quot;Viva Forever&quot;, the last single released from &quot;Spiceworld&quot;, and became the Spice Girls&#x27; seventh UK&#x27;s number-one. The video was made before Halliwell&#x27;s departure and features all five members in stop-motion animated form.

While on tour in the United States, the Spice Girls wrote and recorded new material. They released a new song, &quot;Goodbye&quot;, before Christmas in 1998. It was seen as a tribute to Halliwell, although parts of it had originally been written when Halliwell was still a part of the group. It became the Spice Girls&#x27; third consecutive Christmas number one, equalling the record previously set by the Beatles. In November, Bunton and Chisholm appeared at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards without their other bandmates, accepting two awards on behalf of the Spice Girls for Best Pop Act and Best Group. That year, Brown and Adams announced they were pregnant. Brown was married to the dancer Jimmy Gulzer and became known as Mel G for a brief period; she gave birth to their daughter Phoenix Chi in February 1999. Adams gave birth a month after to her son Brooklyn, whose father was the Manchester United footballer David Beckham. Later that year, she married Beckham in a highly publicised wedding in Ireland, taking on his surname, becoming Victoria Beckham.

===1999–2000: &quot;Forever&quot;, solo work, hiatus and split===
By 1999, Brown, Bunton, and Chisholm, had all released music as solo artists. They returned to the studio in August 1999 after an eight-month recording break. It was initially more pop-influenced, similar to their first two albums, and included production from Eliot Kennedy. The sound took on a more mature direction when American producers including Rodney Jerkins, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis came on board to collaborate with the group.

In December 1999, the Spice Girls embarked on a UK tour, Christmas in Spiceworld, in London and Manchester, during which they showcased new songs from the third album. The eight-show tour was attended by more than 153,000 people, grossing $5.7 million in ticket sales. The first four shows, at Manchester Evening News Arena, grossed $2.6 million; the second portion of the tour saw the group play another four shows at Earls Court Arena, grossing $3.1 million. Earlier in the year, the Spice Girls recorded the song &quot;My Strongest Suit&quot; for &quot;Elton John and Tim Rice&#x27;s Aida&quot;, a concept album which became the musical &quot;Aida&quot;. The Spice Girls performed again at the 2000 Brit Awards in March, where they received the Lifetime Achievement award. Halliwell attended but did not join her former bandmates on stage.

In November 2000, the Spice Girls released their third and final album, &quot;Forever.&quot; With an edgier R&amp;B sound, it received lukewarm reviews. In the US, it reached number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart. In the UK, it was released the same week as Westlife&#x27;s &quot;Coast to Coast&quot; and the chart battle was widely reported by the media; Westlife reached number one and the Spice Girls number two. The lead single, the double A-side &quot;Holler&quot; / &quot;Let Love Lead the Way&quot;, became Spice Girls&#x27; ninth UK number one. It failed to enter the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, reaching number seven on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart and number 31 on the Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The Spice Girls&#x27; only major performance of the single came at the 2000 MTV Europe Music Awards in November. In total, &quot;Forever&quot; sold over four million copies. The Spice Girls ceased promotional activities in December 2000, as they began an indefinite hiatus to concentrate on their solo careers. They insisted that the group was not splitting.

===2007–2008: Return of the Spice Girls and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;===

On 28 June 2007, all five members of the Spice Girls, held a press conference at the O2 Arena revealing their intention to reunite for a worldwide concert tour, the Return of the Spice Girls. The plan to re-form had long been speculated by the media, with previous attempts by the organisers of Live 8 and Concert for Diana to reunite the group as a five-piece falling through. Each member of the group was reportedly paid £10 million ($20 million) to do the reunion tour. &quot;Giving You Everything&quot;, an official documentary film about the reunion, was directed by Bob Smeaton and first aired on Australia&#x27;s Fox8 on 16 December 2007, followed by BBC One in the UK on 31 December.

Ticket sales for the first London date of the Return of the Spice Girls tour sold out in 38 seconds. It was reported that over one million people signed up in the UK alone and over five million worldwide for the ticket ballot on the band&#x27;s official website. Sixteen additional dates in London were added, all selling out within one minute. In the United States, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and San Jose shows also sold out, prompting additional dates to be added. It was announced that the Spice Girls would be playing dates in Chicago and Detroit and Boston, as well as additional dates in New York to keep up with the demand. The tour opened in Vancouver on 2 December 2007, with the Spice Girls performing to an audience of 15,000 people, singing 20 songs and changing outfits a total of eight times. Along with the tour sellout, the Spice Girls licensed their name and image to the supermarket chain Tesco.

The Spice Girls&#x27; comeback single, &quot;Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)&quot;, was announced as the official Children in Need charity single for 2007 and was released 5 November. The first public appearance on stage by the Spice Girls occurred at the Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show, where they performed two songs, 1998 single &quot;Stop&quot; and the lead single from their greatest hits album, &quot;Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)&quot;. The show was filmed by CBS on 15 November 2007 for broadcast on 4 December 2007. They also performed both songs live for the BBC Children in Need telethon on 16 November 2007 from Los Angeles. The release of &quot;Headlines (Friendship Never Ends)&quot; peaked at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart, making it the group&#x27;s lowest-charting British single to date. The album peaked at number two on the UK Albums Chart. On 1 February 2008, it was announced that due to personal and family commitments their tour would come to an end in Toronto on 26 February 2008, meaning that tour dates in Beijing, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Sydney, Cape Town and Buenos Aires were cancelled.

The tour was the highest-grossing concert act of 2007–2008, measured as the twelve months ending in April 2008. It produced $107.2 million in ticket sales and merchandising, with sponsorship and ad deals bringing the total to $200 million. The tour&#x27;s 17-night sellout stand at the O2 Arena in London was the highest-grossing engagement of the year, netting £16.5 million (US$33 million) and drawing an audience of 256,647, winning the 2008 &quot;Billboard&quot; Touring Award for Top Boxscore. The group&#x27;s comeback also netted them several other awards, including the Capital Music Icon Award, the &quot;Glamour&quot; Award for Best Band, and the Vodafone Live Music Award for Best Live Return, the last of which saw them beat out acts such as Led Zeppelin and the Sex Pistols.

===2010, 2012: &quot;Viva Forever!&quot; and London Olympics===
At the 2010 Brit Awards, the Spice Girls received a special award for &quot;Best Performance of the 30th Year&quot;. The award was for their 1997 Brit Awards performance of &quot;Wannabe&quot; and &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot;, with Geri Halliwell and Mel B receiving the award from Samantha Fox on behalf of the group.

That year, the Spice Girls collaborated with Fuller, Judy Craymer and Jennifer Saunders to develop a stage musical, &quot;Viva Forever!&quot;. Similar to the ABBA musical &quot;Mamma Mia!&quot;, &quot;Viva Forever!&quot; used the group&#x27;s music to create an original story. In June 2012, to promote the musical, the Spice Girls reunited for a press conference at the St. Pancras Renaissance London Hotel, where the music video for &quot;Wannabe&quot; had been filmed exactly sixteen years earlier. They also appeared in the documentary &quot;Spice Girls&#x27; Story: Viva Forever!&quot;, which aired on 24 December 2012 on ITV1. &quot;Viva Forever!&quot; premiered at the West End&#x27;s Piccadilly Theatre in December 2012, with all five Spice Girls in attendance. It was panned by critics and closed after seven months, with a loss of at least £5 million.

In August 2012, the Spice Girls reunited to perform a medley of &quot;Wannabe&quot; and &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. Their performance received acclaim, and became the most-tweeted moment of the Olympics with over 116,000 tweets per minute on Twitter.

=== 2016, 2018–2019: G.E.M and Spice World tour ===

On 8 July 2016, Brown, Bunton and Halliwell released a video celebrating the 20th anniversary of &quot;Wannabe&quot; and teased news from them as a three-piece. Beckham and Chisholm opted not to take part but gave the project their blessing. A new song, &quot;Song for Her&quot;, was leaked online in November. The reunion project was cancelled due to Halliwell&#x27;s pregnancy.
In late 2018 the Spice Girls officially 
announced their second reunion tour, with tickets going on sale in November 2018. They also revealed they would do it as a four-piece without Beckham, as she declined to join due to commitments regarding her fashion business. Each of the four participating members was reportedly paid £12 million for the tour.

On 24 May 2019, they began the Spice World – 2019 Tour of the UK and Ireland at Croke Park in Dublin, Ireland. The tour concluded with three concerts at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium, with the last taking place on 15 June 2019. Over 13 dates, the tour produced 700,000 spectators and earned $78.2 million in ticket sales. The three-night sellout stand at Wembley Stadium was the highest-grossing engagement of the year, drawing an audience of 221,971 and winning the 2019 &quot;Billboard&quot; Live Music Award for Top Boxscore. Despite sound problems in the early concerts, Anna Nicholson in &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;As nostalgia tours go, this could hardly have been bettered.&quot;

Alongside the tour, the group teamed up with the children&#x27;s book franchise &quot;Mr. Men&quot; to create derivative products such as books, cups, bags and coasters. On 13 June 2019, it was reported that Paramount Animation had greenlit an animated Spice Girls film with old and new songs. The project will be produced by Simon Fuller and written by Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith. A director has not been announced.

===2020–2024: Anniversary commemorations===
To mark the 25th anniversary of &quot;Wannabe&quot;, an EP was released in July 2021 that included previously unreleased demos. On 29 October, the Spice Girls released &quot;Spice25,&quot; a deluxe reissue of &quot;Spice&quot; featuring previously unreleased demos and remixes. The deluxe release saw the album reenter the UK Albums Chart at number five.

On 27 September 2022, the Spice Girls announced the tracklisting for &quot;Spiceworld25&quot;, the 25th anniversary edition of their album &quot;Spiceworld&quot;. The new collection features previously unreleased live versions and remixes, plus previously available B-sides &quot;Walk of Life&quot; and &quot;Outer Space Girls&quot; and a megamix. Their song &quot;Step to Me&quot; was released digitally for the first time ever on the same day as the album announcement. &quot;Spiceworld25&quot; was released on 4 November 2022 and charted at number 46 on the UK Albums Chart. To promote the reissue, new music videos for &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; and &quot;Never Give Up on the Good Times&quot; were also released.

The Royal Mail issued fifteen stamps from 11 January 2024 onwards to mark the 30th anniversary of the Spice Girls.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
According to AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the Spice Girls &quot;used dance-pop as a musical base, but they infused the music with a fiercely independent, feminist stance that was equal parts Madonna, post-riot grrrl alternative rock feminism, and a co-opting of the good-times-all-the-time stance of England&#x27;s new lad culture.&quot; Their songs incorporated a variety of genres, which Halliwell described as a &quot;melding&quot; of the group members&#x27; eclectic musical tastes, but otherwise kept to mainstream pop conventions. Chisholm said: &quot;We all had different artists that we loved. Madonna was a big influence and TLC; we watched a lot of their videos.&quot; A regular collaborator on the group&#x27;s first two albums was the production duo known as Absolute, made up of Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins. Absolute initially found it difficult to work with the group as the duo was heavily into R&amp;B music at the time, while the Spice Girls according to Wilson were &quot;always very poptastic&quot;. Wilson said of the group&#x27;s musical output: &quot;Their sound was actually not getting R&amp;B quite right.&quot;

In his biography of the band, &quot;&quot; (2004), &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist David Sinclair said that the &quot;undeniable artistry&quot; of the group&#x27;s songs had been overlooked. He said the Spice Girls &quot;instinctively had an ear for a catchy tune&quot; without resorting to the &quot;formula balladry and bland modulations&quot; of 90s boy bands Westlife and Boyzone. He praised their &quot;more sophisticated&quot; second album, &quot;Spiceworld&quot;, saying: &quot;Peppered with personality, and each conveying a distinctive musical flavour and lyrical theme, these are songs which couldn&#x27;t sound &quot;less&quot; &#x27;manufactured,&#x27; and which, in several cases, transcend the pop genre altogether.&quot;

===Lyrical themes===
The Spice Girls&#x27; lyrics promote female empowerment and solidarity. Given the young age of their target audience, Lucy Jones of &quot;The Independent&quot; said the Spice Girls&#x27; songs were subversive for their time: &quot;The lyrics were active rather than passive: taking, grabbing, laying it down – all the things little girls were taught never to do. &#x27;Stop right now, thank you very much&#x27;. &#x27;Who do you think you are?&#x27; &#x27;I&#x27;ll tell you what I want, what I really, really want&#x27;.&quot; Musicologist Nicola Dibben cited &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot; as an example of how the Spice Girls inverted traditional gender roles in their lyrics, depicting a man who has fallen in love and displays too much emotion and a woman who remains independent and in control. The Spice Girls emphasised the importance of sisterhood over romance in songs such as &quot;Wannabe&quot;, and embraced safe sex in &quot;2 Become 1&quot;.

Lauren Bravo, author of &quot;What Would the Spice Girls Do?: How the Girl Power Generation Grew Up&quot; (2018), found that even when the Spice Girls sang about romance, the message was &quot;cheerfully non-committal&quot;, in contrast to the songs about breakups and unrequited love other pop stars were singing at the time. Writing for &quot;Bustle&quot;, Taylor Ferber praised the female-driven lyrics as ahead of their time, citing the inclusivity and optimism of songs such as &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; and the sex-positivity of &quot;Last Time Lover&quot; and &quot;Naked&quot;. Ferber concluded: &quot;Between all of their songs about friendship, sex, romance, and living life, a central theme in almost all Spice Girls music was loving yourself first.&quot;

===Vocal arrangements===
Unlike prior pop vocal groups, the Spice Girls shared vocals, rather than having a lead vocalist supported by others. The group did not want any one member to be considered the lead singer, and so each song was divided into one or two lines each, before all five voices harmonised in the chorus. The group faced criticism as this meant that no one voice could stand out, but Sinclair concluded that it &quot;was actually a clever device to ensure that they gained the maximum impact and mileage from their all-in-it-together girl-gang image&quot;.

The Spice Girls&#x27; former vocal coach, Pepi Lemer, described their individual voices as distinct and easy to distinguish, citing the &quot;lightness&quot; of Bunton&#x27;s voice and the &quot;soulful sound&quot; of Brown&#x27;s and Chisholm&#x27;s. Biographer Sean Smith cited Chisholm as the vocalist the group could not do without. Sinclair noted that while Chisholm&#x27;s ad libs are a distinctive feature of certain Spice Girls songs, the difference in the amount of time her voice was featured over any other member was negligible.

While vocal time was distributed equally, musicologist Nicola Dibben found that there was an &quot;interesting inequality&quot; in the way that vocal styles were distributed within the group, which she felt conformed to certain stereotypes associated with race and socioeconomic background. According to Dibben, most of the declamatory style of singing in the group&#x27;s singles were performed by Brown, the only black member, and Chisholm, whom Dibben classified as white working class; this was in contrast to the more lyrical sections allotted to Beckham, whom Dibben classified as white middle class.

===Songwriting===
The Spice Girls did not play instruments, but co-wrote all of their songs. According to their frequent collaborator Richard Stannard, they had two approaches to songwriting: ballads were written in a traditional way with the group sitting around a piano, while songs such as &quot;Wannabe&quot; were the result of tapping into their &quot;mad&quot; energy. Eliot Kennedy, another regular co-writer, said that songwriting sessions with the Spice Girls were &quot;very quick and short&quot;. He described his experience working with them:

What I said to them was, &quot;Look, I&#x27;ve got a chorus—check this out.&quot; And I&#x27;d sing them the chorus and the melody—no lyrics or anything—and straight away five pads and pencils came out and they were throwing lines at us. Ten minutes later, the song was written. Then you go through and refine it. Then later, as you were recording it you might change a few things here and there. But pretty much it was a real quick process. They were confident in what they were doing, throwing it out there.
Absolute&#x27;s Paul Wilson recalled an experience whereby he and Watkins were responsible for writing the backing track and the group would then write the lyrics. Watkins added: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t an 18-year-old girl. They always had this weird ability to come up with phrases that you&#x27;d never heard of.&quot; He said the members would create dance routines at the same time as writing songs, and that &quot;They knew what they wanted to write about, right from day one. You couldn&#x27;t force your musical ideas upon them.&quot;

From the onset, the Spice Girls established a strict 50–50 split of the publishing royalties between them and their songwriting collaborators. As with their vocal arrangements, they were also adamant on maintaining parity between themselves in the songwriting credits. Sinclair said:

The deal between themselves was a strict five-way split on their share of the songwriting royalties &quot;on all songs&quot; irrespective of what any one member of the group had (or had not) contributed to any particular song. Apart from ease of administration, this was also a symbolic expression of the unity which was so much part and parcel of the Spice philosophy.
Sinclair identified Halliwell as a major source of ideas for the Spice Girls&#x27; songs, including many of the concepts and starting points for the group&#x27;s songs. Tim Hawes, who worked with the group when they were starting out, said Halliwell&#x27;s strength was in writing lyrics and pop hooks, and estimated that she was responsible for 60–70% of the lyrics in the songs he worked on. The group&#x27;s collaborators credit the other members of the group as being more active than Halliwell in constructing the melodies and harmonies of their songs. Matt Rowe, who wrote several songs with the Spice Girls, agreed that Halliwell was particularly good when it came to writing lyrics and credits the lyrics for &quot;Viva Forever&quot; to her. He felt that all five members had contributed equally to the songwriting.

==Cultural impact and legacy==
===Pop music resurgence and girl group boom===
The Spice Girls debuted at a time when alternative rock, hip-hop and R&amp;B dominated global music charts. In the group&#x27;s first interview in May 1996, Halliwell told &quot;Music Week&quot;: &quot;We want to bring some of the glamour back to pop, like Madonna had when we were growing up. Pop is about fantasy and escapism, but there&#x27;s so much bullshit around at the moment.&quot; The modern pop phenomenon that the Spice Girls created by targeting early Millennials was credited with changing the music landscape by reviving the pop music genre, bringing about the global wave of late-1990s and early-2000s teen pop acts such as the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and NSYNC.

The Spice Girls have been credited with paving the way for the girl groups and female pop singers that have come after them. Unlike previous girl groups, such as the Andrews Sisters, whose target market was male record buyers, the Spice Girls targeted a young female fanbase. In the UK, they are further credited for disrupting the then male-dominated pop music scene. Prior to the Spice Girls, girl groups such as Bananarama had hit singles in the UK but their album sales were generally underwhelming. A common opinion within the British music industry at the time was that an all-girl pop group would not work because both girls and boys would find the concept too threatening. As a result, teen magazines such as &quot;Smash Hits&quot; and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; initially refused to feature the Spice Girls. 

The massive commercial success of the Spice Girls led to a boom of new girl groups in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Around 20 new girl groups were launched in the UK in 1999, followed by another 35 the next year. Groups that emerged during this period include All Saints, B*Witched, Atomic Kitten, Girl Thing, Girls@Play, Girls Aloud and the Sugababes, all hoping to emulate the Spice Girls&#x27; success. Outside of the UK and Ireland, girl groups such as New Zealand&#x27;s TrueBliss, Australia&#x27;s Bardot, Germany&#x27;s No Angels, Belgium&#x27;s K3, Spain&#x27;s Bellepop, Brazil&#x27;s Rouge, US&#x27;s Cheetah Girls, as well as South Korea&#x27;s Baby Vox and f(x) were also modelled after the Spice Girls.

Twenty-first-century girl groups continue to cite the Spice Girls as a major source of influence, including the Pussycat Dolls, 2NE1, Girls&#x27; Generation, Little Mix, Fifth Harmony, Haim, and Blackpink. Solo female artists who have been similarly influenced by the group include Jess Glynne, Anne-Marie, Foxes, Alexandra Burke, JoJo, Charli XCX, Rita Ora, Billie Eilish, and Beyoncé. During her 2005 &quot;Reflections&quot; concert series, Filipino singer Regine Velasquez performed a medley of five Spice Girls songs as a tribute to the group, citing them as a major influence on her music. Danish singer-songwriter MØ decided to pursue music after watching the Spice Girls on TV as a child, saying in a 2014 interview: &quot;I have them and only them to thank—or to blame—for becoming a singer.&quot; 16-time Grammy Award-winning singer-songwriter Adele credits the Spice Girls as a major influence in regard to her love and passion for music, stating that &quot;they made me what I am today&quot;.

===Girl power===

&quot;Girl power&quot; was a label for the particular facet of feminist empowerment embraced by the band, emphasising female confidence, individuality and sisterhood. The Spice Girls&#x27; particular approach to &quot;girl power&quot; was seen as a boisterous, independent, and sex-positive response to &quot;lad culture&quot;. The phrase was regularly espoused by all five members—although most closely associated with Halliwell—and was often delivered with a peace sign. The &quot;girl power&quot; slogan was originally coined by US punk band Bikini Kill in 1991 and subsequently appeared in a few songs in the early and mid-1990s; most notably, it was the title of British pop duo Shampoo&#x27;s 1996 single which Halliwell later said was her introduction to the phrase. Although the term did not originate with them, it was not until the emergence of the Spice Girls in 1996 that &quot;girl power&quot; exploded onto the mainstream consciousness. According to Chisholm, the band were inspired to champion this cause as a result of the sexism they encountered when they were first starting out in the music business. Industry insiders credit Halliwell as being the author of the group&#x27;s &quot;girl power&quot; manifesto, while Halliwell herself once spoke of former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher as being &quot;the pioneer of our ideology&quot;.

In all, the focused, consistent presentation of &quot;girl power&quot; formed the centrepiece of their appeal as a band. The Spice Girls&#x27; brand of postfeminism was distinctive and its message of empowerment appealed to young girls, adolescents and adult women; by being politically neutral, it did not alienate consumers with different allegiances. Virgin&#x27;s director of press Robert Sandall explained the novelty of the group: &quot;There had never been a group of girls who were addressing themselves specifically to a female audience before.&quot; Similarly, John Harlow of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; believed it was this &quot;loyal[ty] to their sex&quot; that set the Spice Girls apart from their predecessors, enabling them to win over young female fans where previous girl groups had struggled. While &quot;girl power&quot; put a name to a social phenomenon, it was met with mixed reactions. Some commentators credit the Spice Girls with reinvigorating mainstream feminism—popularised as &quot;girl power&quot;—in the 1990s, with their mantra serving as a gateway to feminism for their young fans. Conversely, critics dismiss it as no more than a shallow marketing tactic and accuse the group of commercialising the social movement. Regardless, &quot;girl power&quot; became a cultural phenomenon, adopted as the mantra for millions of girls and even making it into the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.
In summation of the concept, author Ryan Dawson said, &quot;The Spice Girls changed British culture enough for Girl Power to now seem completely unremarkable.&quot;

In keeping with their &quot;girl power&quot; manifesto, the Spice Girls&#x27; songs have been praised for their &quot;genuinely empowering messages about friendship and sisterhood,&quot; which set them apart from the typical love songs their pop contemporaries were singing. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine said their lyrics &quot;demonstrated real, noncompetitive female friendship,&quot; adding that the messages the Spice Girls imparted have held up well compared to the lyrics sung by later girl groups such as the Pussycat Dolls. The group&#x27;s debut single &quot;Wannabe&quot; has been hailed as an &quot;iconic girl power anthem&quot;. In 2016, the United Nations launched their #WhatIReallyReallyWant Global Goals campaign by filming a remake of the &quot;Wannabe&quot; music video to highlight gender inequality issues faced by women across the world. The video, which premiered on YouTube and ran in movie theatres internationally, featured British girl group M.O, Canadian &quot;viral sensation&quot; Taylor Hatala, Nigerian-British singer Seyi Shay and Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez lip-syncing to the song in various locations around the world. In response to the remake, Beckham said, &quot;How fabulous is it that after 20 years the legacy of the Spice Girls&#x27; girl power is being used to encourage and empower a whole new generation?&quot;

At the 43rd People&#x27;s Choice Awards in 2017, Blake Lively dedicated her &quot;Favorite Dramatic Movie Actress&quot; award to &quot;girl power&quot; in her acceptance speech; she credited the Spice Girls, saying: &quot;What was so neat about them was that they&#x27;re all so distinctly different, and they were women, and they owned who they were, and that was my first introduction into girl power.&quot; In 2018, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named the Spice Girls&#x27; &quot;girl power&quot; ethos on &quot;The Millennial 100&quot;, a list of 100 people, music, cultural touchstones and movements that have shaped the Millennial generation. Writing in 2019 about the group&#x27;s influence on what she called the &quot;Spice Girls Generation&quot;, Caity Weaver of &quot;The New York Times&quot; concluded, &quot;Marketing ploy or not, &#x27;Girl power&#x27; had become a self-fulfilling prophecy.&quot;

===Cool Britannia===
The term &quot;Cool Britannia&quot; became prominent in the media in the 1990s and represented the new political and social climate that was emerging with the advances made by New Labour and the new British prime minister Tony Blair. Coming out of a period of 18 years of Conservative government, Tony Blair and New Labour were seen as young, cool and appealing, a driving force in giving Britain a feeling of euphoria and optimism.

Although by no means responsible for the onset of &quot;Cool Britannia&quot;, the arrival of the Spice Girls added to the new image and re-branding of Britain, and underlined the growing world popularity of British, rather than American, pop music. This fact was underlined at the 1997 Brit Awards; the group won two awards but it was Halliwell&#x27;s iconic red, white and blue Union Jack mini-dress that appeared in media coverage around the world, becoming an enduring image of &quot;Cool Britannia&quot;. The Spice Girls were identified as part of another British Invasion of the US, and in 2016, &quot;Time&quot; acknowledged the Spice Girls as &quot;arguably the most recognisable face&quot; of &quot;Cool Britannia&quot;.

===Image, nicknames and fashion trends===
The Spice Girls&#x27; image was deliberately aimed at young girls, an audience of formidable size and potential. Instrumental to their range of appeal within this demographic was their five distinct personalities and styles, which encouraged fans to identify with one member or another. This rejection of a homogeneous group identity was a stark departure from previous groups such as the Beatles and the Supremes, and the Spice Girls model has since been used to style other pop groups such as One Direction.

The band&#x27;s image was inadvertently bolstered by the nicknames bestowed on them by the British press. After a lunch with the Spice Girls in the wake of &quot;Wannabes release, Peter Loraine, the then-editor of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; magazine, and his editorial staff decided to devise nicknames for each member of the group based on their personalities. Loraine explained, &quot;In the magazine we used silly language and came up with nicknames all the time so it came naturally to give them names that would be used by the magazine and its readers; it was never meant to be adopted globally.&quot; Shortly after using the nicknames in a magazine feature on the group, Loraine received calls from other British media outlets requesting permission to use them, and before long the nicknames were synonymous with the Spice Girls. Jennifer Cawthron, one of the magazine&#x27;s staff writers, explained how the nicknames were chosen:
Victoria was &#x27;Posh Spice&#x27;, because she was wearing a Gucci-style mini dress and seemed pouty and reserved. Emma wore pigtails and sucked a lollipop, so obviously she was &#x27;Baby Spice&#x27;. Mel C spent the whole time leaping around in her tracksuit, so we called her &#x27;Sporty Spice&#x27;. I named Mel B &#x27;Scary Spice&#x27; because she was so shouty. And Geri was &#x27;Ginger Spice&#x27;, simply because of her hair. Not much thought went into that one.
In a 2020 interview, Chisholm explained that the Spice Girls&#x27; image came about unintentionally when, after initially trying to coordinate their outfits as was expected of girl groups at the time, the group decided to just dress in their own individual styles. According to Chisholm, they &quot;never thought too much more of it&quot; until after &quot;Wannabe&quot; was released and the press gave them their nicknames. The group embraced the nicknames and grew into caricatures of themselves, which Chisholm said was &quot;like a protection mechanism because it was like putting on this armour of being this, this character, rather than it actually being you.&quot;

Each Spice Girl adopted a distinct, over-the-top trademark style that served as an extension of her public persona.

*Victoria Beckham (née Adams): As Posh Spice, she was known for her choppy brunette bob cut, reserved attitude, signature pout and form-fitting designer outfits (often a little black dress).
*Melanie Brown: As Scary Spice, she was known for her &quot;in-your-face&quot; attitude, &quot;loud&quot; Leeds accent, pierced tongue and bold manner of dress (which often consisted of leopard-print outfits).
*Emma Bunton: As Baby Spice, she was the youngest member of the group, wore her long blonde hair in pigtails, wore pastel (particularly pink) babydoll dresses and platform sneakers, had an innocent smile and a girly girl personality.
*Melanie Chisholm: As Sporty Spice, she usually wore a tracksuit paired with athletic shoes, wore her long dark hair in a high ponytail, and sported tattoos coupled with a tough-girl attitude. She also showcased her athletic abilities on stage, such as by performing back handsprings and high kicks.
*Geri Halliwell: As Ginger Spice, she was known for her bright red hair, feistiness, &quot;glammed-up sex appeal&quot; and flamboyant stage outfits. She was also identified by the media and those who worked with the Spice Girls as the leader of the group.

The Spice Girls are considered style icons of the 1990s; their image and styles becoming inextricably tied to the band&#x27;s identity. They are credited with setting 1990s fashion trends such as Buffalo platform shoes and double bun hairstyles. Their styles have inspired other celebrities including Katy Perry, Charli XCX, and Bollywood actress Anushka Ranjan. Lady Gaga performed as Emma Bunton (Baby Spice) in high school talent shows and Emma Stone chose the name &quot;Emma&quot; inspired by Emma Bunton after she previously used the name Riley Stone. The group have also been noted for the memorable outfits they have worn, the most iconic being Halliwell&#x27;s Union Jack dress from the 1997 Brit Awards. The dress was sold at a charity auction to the Las Vegas Hard Rock Cafe for £41,320, giving Halliwell the &quot;Guinness World Record&quot; at that time for the most expensive piece of pop star clothing ever sold.

===Commercialisation and celebrity culture===
At the height of Spicemania, the Spice Girls were involved in a prolific marketing phenomenon. Under the guidance of their mentor and manager Simon Fuller, they advertised for an unprecedented number of brands and became the most merchandised group in music history. The group were also a frequent feature of the global press. As a result, said biographer David Sinclair, &quot;So great was the daily bombardment of Spice images and Spice product that it quickly became oppressive even to people who were well disposed towards the group.&quot; This was parodied in the video for their song &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot;, which depicts a futuristic dystopian city covered in billboards and adverts featuring the group. Similarly, the North American leg of their 1998 Spiceworld Tour introduced a whole new concert revenue stream when it became the first time advertising was used in a pop concert. Overall, the Spice Girls&#x27; earnings in the 1990s were on par with that of a medium-sized corporation thanks in large part to their marketing endeavours, with their global gross income estimated at $500–800 million by May 1998.

In his analysis of the group&#x27;s enduring influence on 21st-century popular culture, John Mckie of the BBC observed that while other stars had used brand endorsements in the past, &quot;the Spice brand was the first to propel the success of the band&quot;. Christopher Barrett and Ben Cardew of &quot;Music Week&quot; credited Fuller&#x27;s &quot;ground-breaking&quot; strategy of marketing the Spice Girls as a brand with revolutionising the pop music industry, &quot;paving the way for everything from The White Stripes cameras to U2 iPods and Girls Aloud phones.&quot; Barrett further noted that pop music and brand synergy have become inextricably linked in the modern music industry, which he attributed to the &quot;remarkable&quot; impact of the Spice Girls. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Sylvia Patterson also wrote of what she called the group&#x27;s true legacy: &quot;[T]hey were the original pioneers of the band as brand, of pop as a ruthless marketing ruse, of the merchandising and sponsorship deals that have dominated commercial pop ever since.&quot;

The mainstream media embraced the Spice Girls at the peak of their success. The group received regular international press coverage and were constantly followed by paparazzi. Paul Gorman of &quot;Music Week&quot; said of the media interest in the Spice Girls in the late 1990s: &quot;They inaugurated the era of cheesy celebrity obsession which pertains today. There is lineage from them to the Kardashianisation not only of the music industry, but the wider culture.&quot; The &quot;Irish Independent&quot; Tanya Sweeney agreed that &quot;[t]he vapidity of paparazzi culture could probably be traced back to the Spice Girls&#x27; naked ambitions&quot;, while Mckie predicted that, &quot;[f]or all that modern stars from Katy Perry to Lionel Messi exploit brand endorsements and attract tabloid coverage, the scale of the Spice Girls&#x27; breakthrough in 1996 is unlikely to be repeated—at least not by a music act.&quot;

===1990s and gay icons===
The Spice Girls have been labelled the biggest pop phenomenon of the 1990s due to the international record sales, iconic symbolism, global cultural influence and apparent omnipresence they held during the decade. The group appeared on the cover of the July 1997 edition of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; accompanied with the headline, &quot;Spice Girls Conquer the World&quot;. At the 2000 Brit Awards, the group received the Outstanding Contribution to Music Award in honour of their success in the global music scene in the 1990s. The iconic symbolism of the Spice Girls in the 1990s is partly attributed to their era-defining outfits, the most notable being the Union Jack dress that Halliwell wore at the 1997 Brit Awards. The dress has achieved iconic status, becoming one of the most prominent symbols of 1990s pop culture. The status of the Spice Girls as 1990s pop culture icons is also attributed to their vast marketing efforts and willingness to be a part of a media-driven world. Their unprecedented appearances in adverts and the media solidified the group as a phenomenon—an icon of the decade and for British music.

A study conducted by the British Council in 2000 found that the Spice Girls were the second-best-known Britons internationally—only behind then-Prime Minister Tony Blair—and the best-known Britons in Asia. The group were featured in VH1&#x27;s &quot;I Love the &#x27;90s&quot; and the sequel &quot;I Love the &#x27;90s: Part Deux&quot;; the series covered cultural moments from 1990s with the Spice Girls&#x27; rise to fame representing the year 1997, while Halliwell quitting the group represented 1998. In 2006, ten years after the release of their debut single, the Spice Girls were voted the biggest cultural icons of the 1990s with 80 per cent of the votes in a UK poll of 1,000 people carried out for the board game &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;, stating that &quot;Girl Power&quot; defined the decade. The Spice Girls also ranked number ten in the E! TV special, &quot;The 101 Reasons the &#x27;90s Ruled&quot;.

Some sources, especially those in the United Kingdom, regard the Spice Girls as gay icons. In a 2007 UK survey of more than 5,000 gay men and women, Beckham placed 12th and Halliwell placed 43rd in a ranking of the top 50 gay icons. Halliwell was the recipient of the Honorary Gay Award at the 2016 Attitude Awards and Chisholm was given the &quot;Celebrity Ally&quot; award at the 2021 British LGBT Awards. In a 2005 interview, Bunton attributed their large gay following to the group&#x27;s fun-loving nature, open-mindedness and their love of fashion and dressing up. The LGBTQ magazine &quot;Gay Times&quot; credits the Spice Girls as having been &quot;ferocious advocates of the community&quot; throughout their whole career. According to Bunton, the LGBTQ community was a big influence on the group&#x27;s music. A desire to be more inclusive also led the group to change the lyrics in &quot;2 Become 1&quot;; the lyric &quot;Any deal that we endeavour/boys and girls feel good together&quot; appears in their debut album but was changed to &quot;Once again if we endeavour/love will bring us back together&quot; for the single and music video release.

==Portrayal in the media==
The Spice Girls became media icons in Great Britain and a regular feature of the British press. During the peak of their worldwide fame in 1997, the paparazzi were constantly seen following them everywhere to obtain stories and gossip about the group, such as a supposed affair between Emma Bunton and manager Simon Fuller, or constant split rumours which became fodder for numerous tabloids. Rumours of in-fighting and conflicts within the group also made headlines, with the rumours suggesting that Geri Halliwell and Melanie Brown in particular were fighting to be the leader of the group. Brown, who later admitted that she used to be a &quot;bitch&quot; to Halliwell, said the problems had stayed in the past. The rumours reached their height when the Spice Girls dismissed their manager Simon Fuller during the power struggles, with Fuller reportedly receiving a £10 million severance cheque to keep quiet about the details of his sacking. Months later, in May 1998, Halliwell would leave the band amid rumours of a falling out with Brown; the news of Halliwell&#x27;s departure was covered as a major news story by media around the world, and became one of the biggest entertainment news stories of the decade.

In February 1997 at the Brit Awards, Halliwell&#x27;s Union Jack dress from the Spice Girls&#x27; live performance made all the front pages the next day. During the ceremony, Halliwell&#x27;s breasts were exposed twice, causing controversy. In the same year, nude glamour shots of Halliwell taken earlier in her career were released, causing some scandal.

The stories of their encounters with other celebrities also became fodder for the press; for example, in May 1997, at The Prince&#x27;s Trust 21st-anniversary concert, Brown and Halliwell breached royal protocol when they planted kisses on Prince Charles&#x27;s cheeks, leaving it covered with lipstick, and later, Halliwell told him &quot;you&#x27;re very sexy&quot; and also pinched his bottom. In November, the British royal family were considered fans of the Spice Girls, including The Prince of Wales and his sons Prince William and Prince Harry. That month, South African President Nelson Mandela said: &quot;These are my heroes. This is one of the greatest moments in my life&quot; in an encounter organised by Prince Charles, who said, &quot;It is the second greatest moment in my life, the first time I met them was the greatest&quot;. Prince Charles would later send Halliwell a personal letter &quot;with lots of love&quot; when he heard that she had quit the Spice Girls. In 1998 the video game magazine &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; created The More Annoying Than the Spice Girls Award, adding: &quot;What could possibly have been more annoying in 1997 than the Spice Girls, you ask?&quot;.

Victoria Adams started dating football player David Beckham in late 1997 after they had met at a charity football match. The couple announced their engagement in 1998 and were dubbed &quot;Posh and Becks&quot; by the media, becoming a cultural phenomenon in their own right.

==Other brand ventures==

===Film===
The group made their film debut in &quot;Spice World&quot; with director Bob Spiers. Meant to accompany their second album, the style and content of the movie was in the same vein as the Beatles&#x27; films in the 1960s such as &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;. The light-hearted comedy, intended to capture the spirit of the Spice Girls, featured Richard E. Grant, Alan Cumming, Roger Moore, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Elton John, Richard O&#x27;Brien, Bob Hoskins, Jennifer Saunders, Elvis Costello and Meat Loaf.

&quot;Spice World&quot; was released in December 1997 and proved to be a hit at the box office, taking in over $100 million worldwide. Despite being a commercial success, the film was widely panned by critics; the movie was nominated for seven awards at the 1999 Golden Raspberry Awards where the Spice Girls collectively won the award for &quot;Worst Actress&quot;. Considered a cult classic, several critics have reevaluated the film more positively in the years following its initial release. Since 2014, the Spice Bus, which was driven by Meat Loaf in the film, has been on permanent display at the Island Harbour Marina on the Isle of Wight, England.

===Television===

The Spice Girls have hosted and starred in various television specials. In November 1997, they became the first pop group to host ITV&#x27;s &quot;An Audience with...&quot;; their show featured an all-female audience and was watched by 11.8 million viewers in the UK, one fifth of the country&#x27;s population. The group hosted the Christmas Day edition of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; on BBC1 in 1996. The following year, a special Christmas Eve edition of the BBC series was dedicated to them, titled &quot;Spice Girls on Top of the Pops&quot;. The group have also starred in numerous MTV television specials, including &quot;Spice Girls: Girl Power A–Z&quot; and &quot;MTV Ultrasound, Sugar and Spice and Everything Nice&quot;. Their concerts have also been broadcast in various countries: Girl Power! Live in Istanbul (1997) was broadcast on ITV, Showtime, and Fox Family Channel; Spiceworld Tour (1998) was broadcast on Sky Box Office; and Christmas in Spiceworld (1999) was broadcast on Sky One and Fox Kids, among others.

The group have starred in television commercials for brands such as Pepsi, Polaroid, Walkers, Impulse and Tesco. They have also released a few official documentary films, including &quot;Spice Girls in America: A Tour Story&quot; (1999) and &quot;Giving You Everything&quot; (2007). Making-of documentaries for their film &quot;Spice World&quot; were broadcast on Channel 5 and MTV. The Spice Girls have been the subject of numerous unofficial documentary films, commissioned and produced by individuals independent of the group, including &quot;Raw Spice&quot; (2001), &quot;Seven Days That Shook the Spice Girls&quot; (2002), and &quot;Spice Girls: How Girl Power Changed Britain&quot; (2021). The group have had episodes dedicated to them in several music biography series, including VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot;, &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; and MTV&#x27;s &quot;BioRhythm&quot;.

===Merchandise and sponsorship deals===
In the late 1990s, the Spice Girls were involved in a prolific marketing phenomenon that saw them become the most merchandised group in music history. They negotiated lucrative endorsement deals with numerous brands, including Pepsi, Asda, Cadbury and Target, which led to accusations of overexposure and &quot;selling out&quot;. The group was estimated to have earned over £300 million ($500 million) from their marketing endeavours in 1997 alone. Their subsequent reunion concert tours saw the Spice Girls launch new sponsorship and advertising campaigns with the likes of Tesco and Victoria&#x27;s Secret in 2007, and Walkers and &quot;Mr. Men&quot; in 2019.

===Viva Forever!===

&quot;Viva Forever!&quot; is a jukebox musical written by Jennifer Saunders, produced by Judy Craymer and directed by Paul Garrington. Based on the songs of the Spice Girls, the musical ran at the Piccadilly Theatre in the West End from 11 December 2012 to 29 June 2013.

==Career records and achievements==
As a group, the Spice Girls have received a number of notable awards, including five Brit Awards, three American Music Awards, four &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, three MTV Europe Music Awards, one MTV Video Music Award and three World Music Awards. They have also been recognised for their songwriting achievements with two Ivor Novello Awards. In 2000, they received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music, making them the youngest recipients of the Lifetime Achievement award whose previous winners include Elton John, the Beatles and Queen.

The Spice Girls are the best-selling British act of the 1990s, having comfortably outsold all of their peers including Oasis and the Prodigy. They are the best-selling girl group of all time. They have sold 100 million records worldwide, achieving certified sales of 13 million albums in Europe, 14 million records in the US and 2.4 million in Canada. The group achieved the highest-charting debut for a UK group on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number five with &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;. They are also the first British band since the Rolling Stones in 1975 to have two top-ten albums in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart at the same time (&quot;Spice&quot; and &quot;Spiceworld&quot;). In addition to this, the Spice Girls also achieved the highest-ever annual earnings by an all-female group with an income of £29.6 million (approximately US$49 million) in 1998. In 1999, they ranked sixth in &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; inaugural Celebrity 100 Power Ranking, which made them the highest-ranking musicians.

They produced a total of nine number one singles in the UK—tied with ABBA behind Take That (eleven), the Shadows (twelve), Madonna (thirteen), Westlife (fourteen), Cliff Richard (fourteen), the Beatles (seventeen) and Elvis Presley (twenty-one). The group had three consecutive Christmas number-one singles in the UK (&quot;2 Become 1&quot;, 1996; &quot;Too Much&quot;, 1997; &quot;Goodbye&quot;, 1998); they only share this record with the Beatles and LadBaby. Their first single, &quot;Wannabe&quot;, is the most successful song released by an all-female group. Debuting on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart at number eleven, it is also the highest-ever-charting debut by a British band in the US, beating the previous record held by the Beatles for &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; and the joint highest entry for a debut act, tying with Alanis Morissette.

&quot;Spice&quot; is the 18th-best-selling album of all time in the UK with over 3 million copies sold, and topped the charts for 15 non-consecutive weeks, the most by a female group in the UK. It is also the best-selling album of all time by a girl group, with sales of over 23 million copies worldwide. &quot;Spiceworld&quot; shipped 7 million copies in just two weeks, including 1.4 million in Britain alone—the largest-ever shipment of an album over 14 days. They are also the first act (and so far only female act) to have their first six singles (&quot;Wannabe&quot;, &quot;Say You&#x27;ll Be There&quot;, &quot;2 Become 1&quot;, &quot;Mama&quot;/&quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot;, &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot; and &quot;Too Much&quot;) make number one on the UK charts. Their run was broken by &quot;Stop&quot;, which peaked at number two in March 1998.

The Spice Girls have the highest-grossing concert tours by an all-female group across two decades (2000–2020), grossing nearly $150 million in ticket sales across 58 shows. They are also the most-merchandised group in music history. Their Spice Girls dolls are the best-selling celebrity dolls of all time with sales of over 11 million; the dolls were the second-best-selling toy, behind the &quot;Teletubbies&quot;, of 1998 in the US according to the trade publication &quot;Playthings&quot;. Their film, &quot;Spice World&quot;, broke the record for the highest-ever weekend debut on Super Bowl weekend (25 January 1998) in the US, with box office sales of $10,527,222. &quot;Spice World&quot; topped the UK video charts on its first week of release, selling over 55,000 copies on its first day in stores and 270,000 copies in the first week.

==In popular culture==

In February 1997, the &quot;Sugar Lumps&quot;, a satirical version of the Spice Girls played by Kathy Burke, Dawn French, Llewella Gideon, Lulu and Jennifer Saunders, filmed a video for British charity Comic Relief. The video starts with the Sugar Lumps as schoolgirls who really want to become pop stars like the Spice Girls, and ends with them joining the group on stage, while dancing and lip-syncing the song &quot;Who Do You Think You Are&quot;. The Sugar Lumps later joined the Spice Girls during their live performance of the song on Comic Relief&#x27;s telethon &quot;Red Nose Day&quot; event in March 1997. In January 1998, a fight between animated versions of the Spice Girls and pop band Hanson was the headlining matchup in MTV&#x27;s claymation parody &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch Deathbowl &#x27;98&quot; special that aired during the Super Bowl XXXII halftime. The episode became the highest-rated special in the network&#x27;s history and MTV turned the concept into a full-fledged television series soon after.

In March 2013, the &quot;Glee&quot; characters Brittany (Heather Morris), Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz), Marley (Melissa Benoist), Kitty (Becca Tobin) and Unique (Alex Newell) dressed up as the Spice Girls and performed the song &quot;Wannabe&quot; on the 17th episode of the fourth season of the show. In April 2016, the Italian variety show &quot;Laura &amp; Paola&quot; on Rai 1 featured the hosts, Grammy Award-winning singer Laura Pausini and actress Paola Cortellesi, and their guests, Francesca Michielin, Margherita Buy and Claudia Gerini, dressed up as the Spice Girls to perform a medley of Spice Girls songs as part of a 20th-anniversary tribute to the band. In December 2016, the episode &quot;Who Needs Josh When You Have a Girl Group?&quot; of the musical comedy drama series &quot;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend&quot; featured cast members Rachel Bloom, Gabrielle Ruiz and Vella Lovell performing an original song titled &quot;Friendtopia&quot;, a parody of the Spice Girls&#x27; songs and &quot;girl power&quot; philosophy. Rapper Aminé&#x27;s 2017 single &quot;Spice Girl&quot; is a reference to the group, and the song&#x27;s music video includes an appearance by Brown. Other songs that reference the Spice Girls include &quot;Grigio Girls&quot; by Lady Gaga, &quot;My Name Is&quot; by Eminem, &quot;Polka Power!&quot; (a reference to &quot;Girl Power&quot;) by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic, &quot;Playinwitme&quot; by Kyle and Kehlani, &quot;Kinky&quot; by Kesha, and &quot;Spicy&quot; by Diplo, Herve Pagez and Charli XCX.

In the late 1990s, Spice Girls parodies appeared in various American sketch comedy shows including &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (SNL), &quot;Mad TV&quot; and &quot;All That&quot;. A January 1998 episode of SNL featured cast members, including guest host Sarah Michelle Gellar, impersonating the Spice Girls for two &quot;An Important Message About ...&quot; sketches. In September 1998, the show once again featured cast members, including guest host Cameron Diaz, impersonating the Spice Girls for a sketch titled &quot;A Message from the Spice Girls&quot;. Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;All That&quot; had recurring sketches with the fictional boy band &quot;The Spice Boys&quot;, featuring cast members Nick Cannon as &quot;Sweaty Spice&quot;, Kenan Thompson as &quot;Spice Cube&quot;, Danny Tamberelli as &quot;Hairy Spice&quot;, Josh Server as &quot;Mumbly Spice&quot;, and a skeleton prop as &quot;Dead Spice&quot;.

Parodies of the Spice Girls have also appeared in major advertising campaigns. In 1997, Jack in the Box, an American fast-food chain restaurant, sought to capitalise on &quot;Spice mania&quot; in America by launching a national television campaign using a fictional girl group called the Spicy Crispy Chicks (a take off of the Spice Girls) to promote the new Spicy Crispy Sandwich. The Spicy Crispy Chicks concept was used as a model for another successful advertising campaign called the &#x27;Meaty Cheesy Boys&#x27;. At the 1998 Association of Independent Commercial Producers (AICP) Show, one of the Spicy Crispy Chicks commercials won the top award for humour. In 2001, prints adverts featuring a parody of the Spice Girls, along with other British music icons consisting of the Beatles, Elton John, Freddie Mercury and the Rolling Stones, were used in the Eurostar national advertising campaign in France. The campaign won the award for Best Outdoor Campaign at the French advertising CDA awards. In September 2016, an Apple Music advert premiered during the 68th Primetime Emmy Awards that featured comedian James Corden dressed up as various music icons including all five of the Spice Girls.

Other notable groups of people have been labelled as some variation of a play-on-words on the Spice Girls&#x27; name as an allusion to the band. In 1997, the term &quot;Spice Boys&quot; emerged in the British media as a term coined to characterise the &quot;pop star&quot; antics and lifestyles off the pitch of a group of Liverpool F.C. footballers that includes Jamie Redknapp, David James, Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler and Jason McAteer. The label has stuck with these footballers ever since, with John Scales, one of the so-called Spice Boys, admitting in 2015 that, &quot;We&#x27;re the Spice Boys and it&#x27;s something we have to accept because it will never change.&quot; In the Philippines, the &quot;Spice Boys&quot; tag was given to a group of young Congressmen of the House of Representatives who initiated the impeachment of President Joseph Estrada in 2001. The Australian/British string quartet Bond were dubbed by the international press as the &quot;Spice Girls of classical music&quot; during their launch in 2000 due to their &quot;sexy&quot; image and classical crossover music that incorporated elements of pop and dance music. A spokeswoman for the quartet said in response to the comparisons, &quot;In fact, they are much better looking than the Spice Girls. But we don&#x27;t welcome comparisons. The Bond girls are proper musicians; they have paid their dues.&quot; The Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) doubles team of Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova, two-time Grand Slam and two-time WTA Finals Doubles champions, dubbed themselves the &quot;Spice Girls of tennis&quot; in 1999. Hingis and Kournikova, along with fellow WTA players Venus and Serena Williams, were also labelled the &quot;Spice Girls of tennis&quot;, then later the &quot;Spite Girls&quot;, by the media in the late 1990s due to their youthfulness, popularity and brashness.

Grant Morrison&#x27;s limited series &quot;The Multiversity&quot; (2014–2015) had a team of five women called Lady Blackhawks, inspired by Spice Girls&#x27; names and hair they were named Killah (Scary), Monkey (Sporty), Red (Ginger), Princess (Posh) and Pixie (Baby).

Wax sculptures of the Spice Girls are currently on display at the famed Madame Tussaud&#x27;s New York wax museum. The sculptures of the Spice Girls (sans Halliwell) were first unveiled in December 1999, making them the first pop band to be modelled as a group since the Beatles in 1964 at the time. A sculpture of Halliwell was later made in 2002, and was eventually displayed with the other Spice Girls&#x27; sculptures after Halliwell reunited with the band in 2007. Since 2008, , a travelling exhibition of around 5,000 Spice Girls memorabilia and merchandise, has been shown in museums across the UK. The Spice Girls Exhibition, a collection of over 1,000 Spice Girls items owned by Alan Smith-Allison, was held at the Trakasol Cultural Centre in Limassol Marina, Cyprus in the summer of 2016. Wannabe 1996–2016: A Spice Girls Art Exhibition, an exhibition of Spice Girls-inspired art, was held at The Ballery in Berlin in 2016 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the group&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Wannabe&quot;.

<text>In physics, statistical mechanics is a mathematical framework that applies statistical methods and probability theory to large assemblies of microscopic entities. Sometimes called statistical physics or statistical thermodynamics, its applications include many problems in the fields of physics, biology, chemistry, neuroscience, computer science, information theory and sociology. Its main purpose is to clarify the properties of matter in aggregate, in terms of physical laws governing atomic motion.

Statistical mechanics arose out of the development of classical thermodynamics, a field for which it was successful in explaining macroscopic physical properties—such as temperature, pressure, and heat capacity—in terms of microscopic parameters that fluctuate about average values and are characterized by probability distributions.

While classical thermodynamics is primarily concerned with thermodynamic equilibrium, statistical mechanics has been applied in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to the issues of microscopically modeling the speed of irreversible processes that are driven by imbalances. Examples of such processes include chemical reactions and flows of particles and heat. The fluctuation–dissipation theorem is the basic knowledge obtained from applying non-equilibrium statistical mechanics to study the simplest non-equilibrium situation of a steady state current flow in a system of many particles.

== History ==
In 1738, Swiss physicist and mathematician Daniel Bernoulli published &quot;Hydrodynamica&quot; which laid the basis for the kinetic theory of gases. In this work, Bernoulli posited the argument, still used to this day, that gases consist of great numbers of molecules moving in all directions, that their impact on a surface causes the gas pressure that we feel, and that what we experience as heat is simply the kinetic energy of their motion.

The founding of the field of statistical mechanics is generally credited to three physicists:
*Ludwig Boltzmann, who developed the fundamental interpretation of entropy in terms of a collection of microstates
*James Clerk Maxwell, who developed models of probability distribution of such states
*Josiah Willard Gibbs, who coined the name of the field in 1884

In 1859, after reading a paper on the diffusion of molecules by Rudolf Clausius, Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell formulated the Maxwell distribution of molecular velocities, which gave the proportion of molecules having a certain velocity in a specific range. This was the first-ever statistical law in physics. Maxwell also gave the first mechanical argument that molecular collisions entail an equalization of temperatures and hence a tendency towards equilibrium. Five years later, in 1864, Ludwig Boltzmann, a young student in Vienna, came across Maxwell&#x27;s paper and spent much of his life developing the subject further.

Statistical mechanics was initiated in the 1870s with the work of Boltzmann, much of which was collectively published in his 1896 &quot;Lectures on Gas Theory&quot;. Boltzmann&#x27;s original papers on the statistical interpretation of thermodynamics, the H-theorem, transport theory, thermal equilibrium, the equation of state of gases, and similar subjects, occupy about 2,000 pages in the proceedings of the Vienna Academy and other societies. Boltzmann introduced the concept of an equilibrium statistical ensemble and also investigated for the first time non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, with his &quot;H&quot;-theorem.

The term &quot;statistical mechanics&quot; was coined by the American mathematical physicist J. Willard Gibbs in 1884. According to Gibbs, the term &quot;statistical&quot;, in the context of mechanics, i.e. statistical mechanics, was first used by the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell in 1871:

&quot;Probabilistic mechanics&quot; might today seem a more appropriate term, but &quot;statistical mechanics&quot; is firmly entrenched. Shortly before his death, Gibbs published in 1902 &quot;Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics&quot;, a book which formalized statistical mechanics as a fully general approach to address all mechanical systems—macroscopic or microscopic, gaseous or non-gaseous. Gibbs&#x27; methods were initially derived in the framework classical mechanics, however they were of such generality that they were found to adapt easily to the later quantum mechanics, and still form the foundation of statistical mechanics to this day.

== Principles: mechanics and ensembles ==
In physics, two types of mechanics are usually examined: classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. For both types of mechanics, the standard mathematical approach is to consider two concepts:
*The complete state of the mechanical system at a given time, mathematically encoded as a phase point (classical mechanics) or a pure quantum state vector (quantum mechanics).
*An equation of motion which carries the state forward in time: Hamilton&#x27;s equations (classical mechanics) or the Schrödinger equation (quantum mechanics)
Using these two concepts, the state at any other time, past or future, can in principle be calculated.
There is however a disconnect between these laws and everyday life experiences, as we do not find it necessary (nor even theoretically possible) to know exactly at a microscopic level the simultaneous positions and velocities of each molecule while carrying out processes at the human scale (for example, when performing a chemical reaction). Statistical mechanics fills this disconnection between the laws of mechanics and the practical experience of incomplete knowledge, by adding some uncertainty about which state the system is in.

Whereas ordinary mechanics only considers the behaviour of a single state, statistical mechanics introduces the statistical ensemble, which is a large collection of virtual, independent copies of the system in various states. The statistical ensemble is a probability distribution over all possible states of the system. In classical statistical mechanics, the ensemble is a probability distribution over phase points (as opposed to a single phase point in ordinary mechanics), usually represented as a distribution in a phase space with canonical coordinate axes. In quantum statistical mechanics, the ensemble is a probability distribution over pure states and can be compactly summarized as a density matrix.

As is usual for probabilities, the ensemble can be interpreted in different ways:
* an ensemble can be taken to represent the various possible states that a &quot;single system&quot; could be in (epistemic probability, a form of knowledge), or
* the members of the ensemble can be understood as the states of the systems in experiments repeated on independent systems which have been prepared in a similar but imperfectly controlled manner (empirical probability), in the limit of an infinite number of trials.
These two meanings are equivalent for many purposes, and will be used interchangeably in this article.

However the probability is interpreted, each state in the ensemble evolves over time according to the equation of motion. Thus, the ensemble itself (the probability distribution over states) also evolves, as the virtual systems in the ensemble continually leave one state and enter another. The ensemble evolution is given by the Liouville equation (classical mechanics) or the von Neumann equation (quantum mechanics). These equations are simply derived by the application of the mechanical equation of motion separately to each virtual system contained in the ensemble, with the probability of the virtual system being conserved over time as it evolves from state to state.

One special class of ensemble is those ensembles that do not evolve over time. These ensembles are known as &quot;equilibrium ensembles&quot; and their condition is known as &quot;statistical equilibrium&quot;. Statistical equilibrium occurs if, for each state in the ensemble, the ensemble also contains all of its future and past states with probabilities equal to the probability of being in that state. (By contrast, &quot;mechanical equilibrium&quot; is a state with a balance of forces that has ceased to evolve.) The study of equilibrium ensembles of isolated systems is the focus of statistical thermodynamics. Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics addresses the more general case of ensembles that change over time, and/or ensembles of non-isolated systems.

== Statistical thermodynamics ==
The primary goal of statistical thermodynamics (also known as equilibrium statistical mechanics) is to derive the classical thermodynamics of materials in terms of the properties of their constituent particles and the interactions between them. In other words, statistical thermodynamics provides a connection between the macroscopic properties of materials in thermodynamic equilibrium, and the microscopic behaviours and motions occurring inside the material.

Whereas statistical mechanics proper involves dynamics, here the attention is focussed on &quot;statistical equilibrium&quot; (steady state). Statistical equilibrium does not mean that the particles have stopped moving (mechanical equilibrium), rather, only that the ensemble is not evolving.

=== Fundamental postulate ===
A sufficient (but not necessary) condition for statistical equilibrium with an isolated system is that the probability distribution is a function only of conserved properties (total energy, total particle numbers, etc.).
There are many different equilibrium ensembles that can be considered, and only some of them correspond to thermodynamics. Additional postulates are necessary to motivate why the ensemble for a given system should have one form or another.

A common approach found in many textbooks is to take the &quot;equal a priori probability postulate&quot;. This postulate states that
: &quot;For an isolated system with an exactly known energy and exactly known composition, the system can be found with &quot;equal probability&quot; in any microstate consistent with that knowledge.&quot;
The equal a priori probability postulate therefore provides a motivation for the microcanonical ensemble described below. There are various arguments in favour of the equal a priori probability postulate:
* Ergodic hypothesis: An ergodic system is one that evolves over time to explore &quot;all accessible&quot; states: all those with the same energy and composition. In an ergodic system, the microcanonical ensemble is the only possible equilibrium ensemble with fixed energy. This approach has limited applicability, since most systems are not ergodic.
* Principle of indifference: In the absence of any further information, we can only assign equal probabilities to each compatible situation.
* Maximum information entropy: A more elaborate version of the principle of indifference states that the correct ensemble is the ensemble that is compatible with the known information and that has the largest Gibbs entropy (information entropy).
Other fundamental postulates for statistical mechanics have also been proposed. For example, recent studies shows that the theory of statistical mechanics can be built without the equal a priori probability postulate. One such formalism is based on the fundamental thermodynamic relation together with the following set of postulates:
where the third postulate can be replaced by the following:
===Three thermodynamic ensembles===
There are three equilibrium ensembles with a simple form that can be defined for any isolated system bounded inside a finite volume. These are the most often discussed ensembles in statistical thermodynamics. In the macroscopic limit (defined below) they all correspond to classical thermodynamics.
; Microcanonical ensemble
: describes a system with a precisely given energy and fixed composition (precise number of particles). The microcanonical ensemble contains with equal probability each possible state that is consistent with that energy and composition.
; Canonical ensemble
: describes a system of fixed composition that is in thermal equilibrium with a heat bath of a precise temperature. The canonical ensemble contains states of varying energy but identical composition; the different states in the ensemble are accorded different probabilities depending on their total energy.
; Grand canonical ensemble
: describes a system with non-fixed composition (uncertain particle numbers) that is in thermal and chemical equilibrium with a thermodynamic reservoir. The reservoir has a precise temperature, and precise chemical potentials for various types of particle. The grand canonical ensemble contains states of varying energy and varying numbers of particles; the different states in the ensemble are accorded different probabilities depending on their total energy and total particle numbers.

For systems containing many particles (the thermodynamic limit), all three of the ensembles listed above tend to give identical behaviour. It is then simply a matter of mathematical convenience which ensemble is used. The Gibbs theorem about equivalence of ensembles was developed into the theory of concentration of measure phenomenon, which has applications in many areas of science, from functional analysis to methods of artificial intelligence and big data technology.

Important cases where the thermodynamic ensembles &quot;do not&quot; give identical results include:
* Microscopic systems.
* Large systems at a phase transition.
* Large systems with long-range interactions.
In these cases the correct thermodynamic ensemble must be chosen as there are observable differences between these ensembles not just in the size of fluctuations, but also in average quantities such as the distribution of particles. The correct ensemble is that which corresponds to the way the system has been prepared and characterized—in other words, the ensemble that reflects the knowledge about that system.

=== Calculation methods ===
Once the characteristic state function for an ensemble has been calculated for a given system, that system is &#x27;solved&#x27; (macroscopic observables can be extracted from the characteristic state function). Calculating the characteristic state function of a thermodynamic ensemble is not necessarily a simple task, however, since it involves considering every possible state of the system. While some hypothetical systems have been exactly solved, the most general (and realistic) case is too complex for an exact solution. Various approaches exist to approximate the true ensemble and allow calculation of average quantities.

====Exact====
There are some cases which allow exact solutions.

* For very small microscopic systems, the ensembles can be directly computed by simply enumerating over all possible states of the system (using exact diagonalization in quantum mechanics, or integral over all phase space in classical mechanics).
* Some large systems consist of many separable microscopic systems, and each of the subsystems can be analysed independently. Notably, idealized gases of non-interacting particles have this property, allowing exact derivations of Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics, Fermi–Dirac statistics, and Bose–Einstein statistics.
* A few large systems with interaction have been solved. By the use of subtle mathematical techniques, exact solutions have been found for a few toy models. Some examples include the Bethe ansatz, square-lattice Ising model in zero field, hard hexagon model.

====Monte Carlo====

Although some problems in statistical physics can be solved analytically using approximations and expansions, most current research utilizes the large processing power of modern computers to simulate or approximate solutions. A common approach to statistical problems is to use a Monte Carlo simulation to yield insight into the properties of a complex system. Monte Carlo methods are important in computational physics, physical chemistry, and related fields, and have diverse applications including medical physics, where they are used to model radiation transport for radiation dosimetry calculations.

The Monte Carlo method examines just a few of the possible states of the system, with the states chosen randomly (with a fair weight). As long as these states form a representative sample of the whole set of states of the system, the approximate characteristic function is obtained. As more and more random samples are included, the errors are reduced to an arbitrarily low level.

* The Metropolis–Hastings algorithm is a classic Monte Carlo method which was initially used to sample the canonical ensemble.
* Path integral Monte Carlo, also used to sample the canonical ensemble.

==== Other ====
* For rarefied non-ideal gases, approaches such as the cluster expansion use perturbation theory to include the effect of weak interactions, leading to a virial expansion.
* For dense fluids, another approximate approach is based on reduced distribution functions, in particular the radial distribution function.
* Molecular dynamics computer simulations can be used to calculate microcanonical ensemble averages, in ergodic systems. With the inclusion of a connection to a stochastic heat bath, they can also model canonical and grand canonical conditions.
* Mixed methods involving non-equilibrium statistical mechanical results (see below) may be useful.

== Non-equilibrium statistical mechanics ==
Many physical phenomena involve quasi-thermodynamic processes out of equilibrium, for example:
* heat transport by the internal motions in a material, driven by a temperature imbalance,
* electric currents carried by the motion of charges in a conductor, driven by a voltage imbalance,
* spontaneous chemical reactions driven by a decrease in free energy,
* friction, dissipation, quantum decoherence,
* systems being pumped by external forces (optical pumping, etc.),
* and irreversible processes in general.
All of these processes occur over time with characteristic rates. These rates are important in engineering. The field of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is concerned with understanding these non-equilibrium processes at the microscopic level. (Statistical thermodynamics can only be used to calculate the final result, after the external imbalances have been removed and the ensemble has settled back down to equilibrium.)

In principle, non-equilibrium statistical mechanics could be mathematically exact: ensembles for an isolated system evolve over time according to deterministic equations such as Liouville&#x27;s equation or its quantum equivalent, the von Neumann equation. These equations are the result of applying the mechanical equations of motion independently to each state in the ensemble. These ensemble evolution equations inherit much of the complexity of the underlying mechanical motion, and so exact solutions are very difficult to obtain. Moreover, the ensemble evolution equations are fully reversible and do not destroy information (the ensemble&#x27;s Gibbs entropy is preserved). In order to make headway in modelling irreversible processes, it is necessary to consider additional factors besides probability and reversible mechanics.

Non-equilibrium mechanics is therefore an active area of theoretical research as the range of validity of these additional assumptions continues to be explored. A few approaches are described in the following subsections.

=== Stochastic methods ===
One approach to non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is to incorporate stochastic (random) behaviour into the system. Stochastic behaviour destroys information contained in the ensemble. While this is technically inaccurate (aside from hypothetical situations involving black holes, a system cannot in itself cause loss of information), the randomness is added to reflect that information of interest becomes converted over time into subtle correlations within the system, or to correlations between the system and environment. These correlations appear as chaotic or pseudorandom influences on the variables of interest. By replacing these correlations with randomness proper, the calculations can be made much easier.

=== Near-equilibrium methods ===
Another important class of non-equilibrium statistical mechanical models deals with systems that are only very slightly perturbed from equilibrium. With very small perturbations, the response can be analysed in linear response theory. A remarkable result, as formalized by the fluctuation–dissipation theorem, is that the response of a system when near equilibrium is precisely related to the fluctuations that occur when the system is in total equilibrium. Essentially, a system that is slightly away from equilibrium—whether put there by external forces or by fluctuations—relaxes towards equilibrium in the same way, since the system cannot tell the difference or &quot;know&quot; how it came to be away from equilibrium.

This provides an indirect avenue for obtaining numbers such as ohmic conductivity and thermal conductivity by extracting results from equilibrium statistical mechanics. Since equilibrium statistical mechanics is mathematically well defined and (in some cases) more amenable for calculations, the fluctuation–dissipation connection can be a convenient shortcut for calculations in near-equilibrium statistical mechanics.

A few of the theoretical tools used to make this connection include:
* Fluctuation–dissipation theorem
* Onsager reciprocal relations
* Green–Kubo relations
* Landauer–Büttiker formalism
* Mori–Zwanzig formalism
* GENERIC formalism

=== Hybrid methods ===
An advanced approach uses a combination of stochastic methods and linear response theory. As an example, one approach to compute quantum coherence effects (weak localization, conductance fluctuations) in the conductance of an electronic system is the use of the Green–Kubo relations, with the inclusion of stochastic dephasing by interactions between various electrons by use of the Keldysh method.

==Applications==
The ensemble formalism can be used to analyze general mechanical systems with uncertainty in knowledge about the state of a system. Ensembles are also used in:
* propagation of uncertainty over time,
* regression analysis of gravitational orbits,
* ensemble forecasting of weather,
* dynamics of neural networks,
* bounded-rational potential games in game theory and non-equilibrium economics.

Statistical physics explains and quantitatively describes superconductivity, superfluidity, turbulence, collective phenomena in solids and plasma, and the structural features of liquid. It underlies the modern astrophysics and virial theorem. In solid state physics, statistical physics aids the study of liquid crystals, phase transitions, and critical phenomena. Many experimental studies of matter are entirely based on the statistical description of a system. These include the scattering of cold neutrons, X-ray, visible light, and more. Statistical physics also plays a role in materials science, nuclear physics, astrophysics, chemistry, biology and medicine (e.g. study of the spread of infectious diseases).

Analytical and computational techniques derived from statistical physics of disordered systems, can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyze the weight space of deep neural networks. Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics.

===Quantum statistical mechanics===

Quantum statistical mechanics is statistical mechanics applied to quantum mechanical systems. In quantum mechanics, a statistical ensemble (probability distribution over possible quantum states) is described by a density operator &quot;S&quot;, which is a non-negative, self-adjoint, trace-class operator of trace 1 on the Hilbert space &quot;H&quot; describing the quantum system. This can be shown under various mathematical formalisms for quantum mechanics. One such formalism is provided by quantum logic.

<doc id="28483" wikidata="Q123524" url="?curid=28483" title="Solstice">
<text>A solstice is the time when the Sun reaches its most northerly or southerly excursion relative to the celestial equator on the celestial sphere. Two solstices occur annually, around 20–22 June and 20–22 December. In many countries, the seasons of the year are defined by reference to the solstices and the equinoxes.

The term &quot;solstice&quot; can also be used in a broader sense, as the day when this occurs. For locations not too close to the equator or the poles, the dates with the longest and shortest periods of daylight are the summer and winter solstices, respectively. Terms with no ambiguity as to which hemisphere is the context are &quot;June solstice&quot; and &quot;December solstice&quot;, referring to the months in which they take place every year.

The word &quot;solstice&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;sol&quot; (&quot;sun&quot;) and &quot;sistere&quot; (&quot;to stand still&quot;), because at the solstices, the Sun&#x27;s declination appears to &quot;stand still&quot;; that is, the seasonal movement of the Sun&#x27;s daily path (as seen from Earth) pauses at a northern or southern limit before reversing direction.

== Definitions and frames of reference ==

For an observer at the North Pole, the Sun reaches the highest position in the sky once a year in June. The day this occurs is called the June solstice day. Similarly, for an observer on the South Pole, the Sun reaches the highest position on the December solstice day. When it is the summer solstice at one Pole, it is the winter solstice on the other. The Sun&#x27;s westerly motion never ceases as Earth is continually in rotation. However, the Sun&#x27;s motion in declination (i.e. vertically) comes to a stop, before reversing, at the moment of solstice. In that sense, solstice means &quot;sun-standing&quot;.

This modern scientific word descends from a Latin scientific word in use in the late Roman Republic of the 1st century BC: &quot;solstitium&quot;. Pliny uses it a number of times in his &quot;Natural History&quot; with a similar meaning that it has today. It contains two Latin-language morphemes, &quot;sol&quot;, &quot;sun&quot;, and &quot;-stitium&quot;, &quot;stoppage&quot;. The Romans used &quot;standing&quot; to refer to a component of the relative velocity of the Sun as it is observed in the sky. Relative velocity is the motion of an object from the point of view of an observer in a frame of reference. From a fixed position on the ground, the Sun appears to orbit around Earth.

To an observer in an inertial frame of reference, planet Earth is seen to rotate about an axis and orbit around the Sun in an elliptical path with the Sun at one focus. Earth&#x27;s axis is tilted with respect to the plane of Earth&#x27;s orbit and this axis maintains a position that changes little with respect to the background of stars. An observer on Earth therefore sees a solar path that is the result of both rotation and revolution.

The component of the Sun&#x27;s motion seen by an earthbound observer caused by the revolution of the tilted axis—which, keeping the same angle in space, is oriented toward or away from the Sun—is an observed daily increment (and lateral offset) of the elevation of the Sun at noon for approximately six months and observed daily decrement for the remaining six months. At maximum or minimum elevation, the relative yearly motion of the Sun perpendicular to the horizon stops and reverses direction.

Outside of the tropics, the maximum elevation occurs at the summer solstice and the minimum at the winter solstice. The path of the Sun, or ecliptic, sweeps north and south between the northern and southern hemispheres. The lengths of time when the sun is up are longer around the summer solstice and shorter around the winter solstice, except near the equator. When the Sun&#x27;s path crosses the equator, the length of the nights at latitudes +L° and −L° are of equal length. This is known as an equinox. There are two solstices and two equinoxes in a tropical year.
Because of the variation in the rate at which the sun&#x27;s right ascension changes, the days of longest and shortest daylight do not coincide with the solstices for locations very close to the equator. At the equator, the longest day is around 23 December and the shortest around 16 September (see graph). Inside the Arctic or Antarctic Circles the sun is up all the time for days or even months.

==Relationship to seasons==

The seasons occur because the Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation is not perpendicular to its orbital plane (the plane of the ecliptic) but currently makes an angle of about 23.44° (called the obliquity of the ecliptic), and because the axis keeps its orientation with respect to an inertial frame of reference. As a consequence, for half the year the Northern Hemisphere is inclined toward the Sun while for the other half year the Southern Hemisphere has this distinction. The two moments when the inclination of Earth&#x27;s rotational axis has maximum effect are the solstices.

At the June solstice the subsolar point is further north than any other time: at latitude 23.44° north, known as the Tropic of Cancer. Similarly at the December solstice the subsolar point is further south than any other time: at latitude 23.44° south, known as the Tropic of Capricorn. The subsolar point will cross every latitude between these two extremes exactly twice per year.

Also during the June solstice, places on the Arctic Circle (latitude 66.56° north) will see the Sun just on the horizon during midnight, and all places north of it will see the Sun above horizon for 24 hours. That is the midnight sun or midsummer-night sun or polar day. On the other hand, places on the Antarctic Circle (latitude 66.56° south) will see the Sun just on the horizon during midday, and all places south of it will not see the Sun above horizon at any time of the day. That is the polar night. During the December Solstice, the effects on both hemispheres are just the opposite. This sees polar sea ice re-grow annually due to lack of sunlight on the air above and surrounding sea. The warmest and coldest periods of the year in temperate regions are offset by about one month from the solstices, delayed by the earth&#x27;s thermal inertia.

==Cultural aspects==

===Ancient Greek names and concepts===
The concept of the solstices was embedded in ancient Greek celestial navigation. As soon as they discovered that the Earth was spherical they devised the concept of the celestial sphere, an imaginary spherical surface rotating with the heavenly bodies (&quot;ouranioi&quot;) fixed in it (the modern one does not rotate, but the stars in it do). As long as no assumptions are made concerning the distances of those bodies from Earth or from each other, the sphere can be accepted as real and is in fact still in use. The Ancient Greeks use the term&quot; &quot;ηλιοστάσιο&quot; (heliostāsio)&quot;, meaning &quot;stand of the Sun&quot;.

The stars move across the inner surface of the celestial sphere along the circumferences of circles in parallel planes perpendicular to the Earth&#x27;s axis extended indefinitely into the heavens and intersecting the celestial sphere in a celestial pole. The Sun and the planets do not move in these parallel paths but along another circle, the ecliptic, whose plane is at an angle, the obliquity of the ecliptic, to the axis, bringing the Sun and planets across the paths of and in among the stars.*

Cleomedes states:The band of the Zodiac (&quot;zōdiakos kuklos&quot;, &quot;zodiacal circle&quot;) is at an oblique angle (&quot;loksos&quot;) because it is positioned between the tropical circles and equinoctial circle touching each of the tropical circles at one point ... This Zodiac has a determinable width (set at 8° today) ... that is why it is described by three circles: the central one is called &quot;heliacal&quot; (&quot;hēliakos&quot;, &quot;of the sun&quot;).

The term heliacal circle is used for the ecliptic, which is in the center of the zodiacal circle, conceived as a band including the noted constellations named on mythical themes. Other authors use Zodiac to mean ecliptic, which first appears in a gloss of unknown author in a passage of Cleomedes where he is explaining that the Moon is in the zodiacal circle as well and periodically crosses the path of the Sun. As some of these crossings represent eclipses of the Moon, the path of the Sun is given a synonym, the &quot;ekleiptikos (kuklos)&quot; from &quot;ekleipsis&quot;, &quot;eclipse&quot;.

===English names===

The two solstices can be distinguished by different pairs of names, depending on which feature one wants to stress.
* Summer solstice and winter solstice are the most common names, referring to the seasons they are associated with. However, these can be ambiguous since the Northern Hemisphere&#x27;s summer is the Southern Hemisphere&#x27;s winter, and vice versa. The Latinate names estival solstice (summer) and hibernal solstice (winter) are sometimes used to the same effect, as are midsummer and midwinter.
* June solstice and December solstice refer to the months of year in which they take place, with no ambiguity as to which hemisphere is the context. They are still not universal, however, as not all cultures use a solar-based calendar where the solstices occur every year in the same month (as they do not in the Islamic calendar and Hebrew calendar, for example).
* Northern solstice and southern solstice indicate the hemisphere of the Sun&#x27;s location. The northern solstice is in June, when the Sun is directly over the Tropic of Cancer in the Northern Hemisphere, and the southern solstice is in December, when the Sun is directly over the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere. These terms can be used unambiguously for other planets.
* First point of Cancer and first point of Capricorn refer to the astrological signs that the sun &quot;is entering&quot; (a system rooted in Roman Classical period dates). Due to the precession of the equinoxes, the constellations the sun appears in at solstices are currently Taurus in June and Sagittarius in December.

===Solstice terms in East Asia===
The traditional East Asian calendars divide a year into 24 solar terms (節氣). Xiàzhì or Geshi () is the 10th solar term, and marks the summer solstice. It begins when the Sun reaches the celestial longitude of 90° (around 21 June) and ends when the Sun reaches the longitude of 105° (around 7 July). Xiàzhì more often refers in particular to the day when the Sun is exactly at the celestial longitude of 90°.

Dōngzhì or Tōji () is the 22nd solar term, and marks the winter solstice. It begins when the Sun reaches the celestial longitude of 270° (around 23 December) and ends when the Sun reaches the longitude of 285° (around 5 January). Dōngzhì more often refers in particular to the day when the Sun is exactly at the celestial longitude of 270°.

The solstices (as well as the equinoxes) mark the middle of the seasons in East Asian calendars. Here, the Chinese character means &quot;extreme&quot;, so the terms for the solstices directly signify the summits of summer and winter.

===Solstice celebrations===

The term &quot;solstice&quot; can also be used in a wider sense, as the date (day) that such a passage happens. The solstices, together with the equinoxes, are connected with the seasons. In some languages they are considered to start or separate the seasons; in others they are considered to be centre points (in England, in the Northern Hemisphere, for example, the period around the northern solstice is known as midsummer). Midsummer&#x27;s Day, defined as St. Johns Day by the Christian Church, is 24 June, about three days after the solstice itself). Similarly 25 December is the start of the Christmas celebration, and is the day the Sun begins to return to the Northern Hemisphere. The traditional British and Irish main rent and meeting days of the year, &quot;the usual quarter days,&quot; were often those of the solstices and equinoxes.

Many cultures celebrate various combinations of the winter and summer solstices, the equinoxes, and the midpoints between them, leading to various holidays arising around these events. During the southern or winter solstice, Christmas is the most widespread contemporary holiday, while Yalda, Saturnalia, Karachun, Hanukkah, Kwanzaa, and Yule are also celebrated around this time. In East Asian cultures, the Dongzhi Festival is celebrated on the winter solstice. For the northern or summer solstice, Christian cultures celebrate the feast of St. John from June 23 to 24 (see St. John&#x27;s Eve, Ivan Kupala Day), while Modern Pagans observe Midsummer, known as Litha among Wiccans. For the vernal (spring) equinox, several springtime festivals are celebrated, such as the Persian Nowruz, the observance in Judaism of Passover, the rites of Easter in most Christian churches, as well as the Wiccan Ostara. The autumnal equinox is associated with the Jewish holiday of Sukkot and the Wiccan Mabon. 

In the southern tip of South America, the Mapuche people celebrate We Tripantu (the New Year) a few days after the northern solstice, on 24 June. Further north, the Atacama people formerly celebrated this date with a noise festival, to call the Sun back. Further east, the Aymara people celebrate their New Year on 21 June. A celebration occurs at sunrise, when the sun shines directly through the Gate of the Sun in Tiwanaku. Other Aymara New Year feasts occur throughout Bolivia, including at the site of El Fuerte de Samaipata.
In the Hindu calendar, two sidereal solstices are named Makara Sankranti which marks the start of Uttarayana and Karka Sankranti which marks the start of Dakshinayana. The former occurs around 14 January each year, while the latter occurs around 14 July each year. These mark the movement of the Sun along a sidereally fixed zodiac (precession is ignored) into Makara, the zodiacal sign which corresponds with Capricorn, and into Karka, the zodiacal sign which corresponds with Cancer, respectively.

The Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station celebrates every year on 21 June a midwinter party, to celebrate that the Sun is at its lowest point and coming back.

The Fremont Solstice Parade takes place every summer solstice in Fremont, Seattle, Washington in the United States.

The reconstructed Cahokia Woodhenge, a large timber circle located at the Mississippian culture Cahokia archaeological site near Collinsville, Illinois, is the site of annual equinox and solstice sunrise observances. Out of respect for Native American beliefs these events do not feature ceremonies or rituals of any kind.

===Solstice determination===
Unlike the equinox, the solstice time is not easy to determine. The changes in solar declination become smaller as the Sun gets closer to its maximum/minimum declination. The days before and after the solstice, the declination speed is less than 30 arcseconds per day which is less than of the angular size of the Sun, or the equivalent to just 2 seconds of right ascension.

This difference is hardly detectable with indirect viewing based devices like sextant equipped with a vernier, and impossible with more traditional tools like a gnomon or an astrolabe. It is also hard to detect the changes in sunrise/sunset azimuth due to the atmospheric refraction changes. Those accuracy issues render it impossible to determine the solstice day based on observations made within the 3 (or even 5) days surrounding the solstice without the use of more complex tools.

Accounts do not survive but Greek astronomers must have used an approximation method based on interpolation, which is still used by some amateurs. This method consists of recording the declination angle at noon during some days before and after the solstice, trying to find two separate days with the same declination. When those two days are found, the halfway time between both noons is estimated solstice time. An interval of 45 days has been postulated as the best one to achieve up to a quarter-day precision, in the solstice determination.
In 2012, the journal DIO found that accuracy of one or two hours with balanced errors can be attained by observing the Sun&#x27;s equal altitudes about S = twenty degrees (or d = about 20 days) before and after the summer solstice because the average of the two times will be early by q arc minutes where q is (πe cosA)/3 times the square of S in degrees (e = earth orbit eccentricity, A = earth&#x27;s perihelion or Sun&#x27;s apogee), and the noise in the result will be about 41 hours divided by d if the eye&#x27;s sharpness is taken as one arc minute.

Astronomical almanacs define the solstices as the moments when the Sun passes through the solstitial colure, i.e. the times when the apparent geocentric celestial longitude of the Sun is equal to 90° (June solstice) or 270° (December solstice). The dates of the solstice varies each year and may occur a day earlier or later depending on the time zone. Because the earth&#x27;s orbit takes slightly longer than a calendar year of 365 days, the solstices occur slightly later each calendar year, until a leap day re-aligns the calendar with the orbit. Thus the solstices always occur between June 20 and 22 and between December 20 and 23 in a four-year-long cycle with the 21st and 22nd being the most common dates, as can be seen in the schedule at the start of the article.

== In the constellations ==
Using the current official IAU constellation boundaries—and taking into account the variable precession speed and the rotation of the ecliptic—the solstices shift through the constellations as follows (expressed in astronomical year numbering in which the year 0 = 1 BC, −1 = 2 BC, etc.):
* The northern solstice passed from Leo into Cancer in year −1458, passed into Gemini in year −10, passed into Taurus in December 1989, and is expected to pass into Aries in year 4609.
* The southern solstice passed from Capricornus into Sagittarius in year −130, is expected to pass into Ophiuchus in year 2269, and is expected to pass into Scorpius in year 3597.

<text>Sputnik 1 (, , &quot;Satellite 1&quot;), sometimes referred to as simply Sputnik, was the first artificial Earth satellite. It was launched into an elliptical low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957 as part of the Soviet space program. It sent a radio signal back to Earth for three weeks before its three silver-zinc batteries became depleted. Aerodynamic drag caused it to fall back into the atmosphere on 4 January 1958. 

It was a polished metal sphere in diameter with four external radio antennas to broadcast radio pulses. Its radio signal was easily detectable by amateur radio operators, and the 65° orbital inclination made its flight path cover virtually the entire inhabited Earth.

The satellite&#x27;s success was unanticipated by the United States. This precipitated the American Sputnik crisis and triggered the Space Race. The launch was the beginning of a new era of political, military, technological, and scientific developments. The word &quot;sputnik&quot; is Russian for &quot;satellite&quot; when interpreted in an astronomical context; its other meanings are &quot;spouse&quot; or &quot;traveling companion&quot;.

Tracking and studying Sputnik 1 from Earth provided scientists with valuable information. The density of the upper atmosphere could be deduced from its drag on the orbit, and the propagation of its radio signals gave data about the ionosphere.

Sputnik 1 was launched during the International Geophysical Year from Site No.1/5, at the 5th Tyuratam range, in Kazakh SSR (now known as the Baikonur Cosmodrome). The satellite traveled at a peak speed of about , taking 96.20 minutes to complete each orbit. It transmitted on 20.005 and 40.002 MHz, which were monitored by radio operators throughout the world. The signals continued for 22 days until the transmitter batteries depleted on 26 October 1957. On 4 January 1958, after three months in orbit, Sputnik 1 burned up while reentering Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, having completed 1,440 orbits of the Earth, and travelling a distance of approximately .

==Etymology==
, romanized as (), means &#x27;Satellite-One&#x27;. The Russian word for satellite, , was coined in the 18th century by combining the prefix (&#x27;fellow&#x27;) and (&#x27;traveler&#x27;), thereby meaning &#x27;fellow-traveler&#x27;, a meaning corresponding to the Latin root (&#x27;guard, attendant or companion&#x27;), which is the origin of English &quot;satellite&quot;. 

In English, &#x27;Sputnik&#x27; is widely recognized as a proper name; however, this is not the case in Russian. In the Russian language, &quot;sputnik&quot; is the general term for the artificial satellites of any country and the natural satellites of any planet. The incorrect attribution of &#x27;Sputnik&#x27; as a proper name can be traced back to an article released by &quot;The New York Times&quot; on 6 October 1957, titled &quot;Soviet &#x27;Sputnik&#x27; Means A Traveler&#x27;s Traveler&quot;. In the referenced article, the term &#x27;Sputnik&#x27; was portrayed as bearing a poetic connotation arising from its linguistic origins. This connotation incorrectly indicated that it was bestowed with the specific proper name &#x27;Fellow-Traveler-One&#x27;, rather than being designated by the general term &#x27;Satellite-One&#x27;. In Russian-language references, Sputnik 1 is recognized by the technical name of &#x27;Satellite-One&#x27;.

== Before the launch ==
=== Satellite construction project ===
On 17 December 1954, chief Soviet rocket scientist Sergei Korolev proposed a developmental plan for an artificial satellite to the Minister of the Defense Industry, Dimitri Ustinov. Korolev forwarded a report by Mikhail Tikhonravov, with an overview of similar projects abroad. Tikhonravov had emphasized that the launch of an orbital satellite was an inevitable stage in the development of rocket technology.

On 29 July 1955, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower announced through his press secretary that, during the International Geophysical Year (IGY), the United States would launch an artificial satellite. Four days later, Leonid Sedov, a leading Soviet physicist, announced that they too would launch an artificial satellite. On 8 August, the Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union approved the proposal to create an artificial satellite. On 30 August, Vasily Ryabikov—the head of the State Commission on the R-7 rocket test launches—held a meeting where Korolev presented calculation data for a spaceflight trajectory to the Moon. They decided to develop a three-stage version of the R-7 rocket for satellite launches.
On 30 January 1956, the Council of Ministers approved practical work on an artificial Earth-orbiting satellite. This satellite, named &quot;Object D&quot;, was planned to be completed in 1957–58; it would have a mass of and would carry of scientific instruments. The first test launch of &quot;Object D&quot; was scheduled for 1957. Work on the satellite was to be divided among institutions as follows:

* The USSR Academy of Sciences was responsible for the general scientific leadership and the supply of research instruments.
* The Ministry of the Defense Industry and its primary design bureau, OKB-1, were assigned the task of building the satellite.
* The Ministry of the Radio technical Industry would develop the control system, radio/technical instruments, and the telemetry system.
* The Ministry of the Ship Building Industry would develop gyroscope devices.
* The Ministry of the Machine Building would develop ground launching, refueling, and transportation means.
* The Ministry of Defense was responsible for conducting launches.

Preliminary design work was completed in July 1956 and the scientific tasks to be carried out by the satellite were defined. These included measuring the density of the atmosphere and its ion composition, the solar wind, magnetic fields, and cosmic rays. These data would be valuable in the creation of future artificial satellites; a system of ground stations was to be developed to collect data transmitted by the satellite, observe the satellite&#x27;s orbit, and transmit commands to the satellite. Because of the limited time frame, observations were planned for only 7 to 10 days and orbit calculations were not expected to be extremely accurate.

By the end of 1956, it became clear that the complexity of the ambitious design meant that &#x27;Object D&#x27; could not be launched in time because of difficulties creating scientific instruments and the low specific impulse produced by the completed R-7 engines (304 seconds instead of the planned 309 to 310 seconds). Consequently, the government rescheduled the launch for April 1958. Object D would later fly as Sputnik 3.

Fearing the U.S. would launch a satellite before the USSR, OKB-1 suggested the creation and launch of a satellite in April–May 1957, before the IGY began in July 1957. The new satellite would be simple, light (), and easy to construct, forgoing the complex, heavy scientific equipment in favour of a simple radio transmitter. On 15 February 1957 the Council of Ministers of the USSR approved this simple satellite, designated &#x27;Object PS&#x27;, PS meaning &quot;&quot;prosteishiy sputnik&quot;,&quot; or &quot;elementary satellite&quot;. This version allowed the satellite to be tracked visually by Earth-based observers, and it could transmit tracking signals to ground-based receiving stations. The launch of two satellites, PS-1 and PS-2, with two R-7 rockets (8K71), was approved, provided that the R-7 completed at least two successful test flights.

=== Launch vehicle preparation and launch site selection ===


The R-7 rocket was initially designed as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) by OKB-1. The decision to build it was made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the USSR on 20 May 1954. The rocket was the most powerful in the world; it was designed with excess thrust since they were unsure how heavy the hydrogen bomb payload would be. The R-7 was also known by its GRAU (later GURVO, the Russian abbreviation for &quot;Chief Directorate of the Rocket Forces&quot;) designation 8K71. At the time, the R-7 was known to NATO sources as the T-3 or M-104, and Type A.

Several modifications were made to the R-7 rocket to adapt it to &#x27;Object D&#x27;, including upgrades to the main engines, the removal of a radio package on the booster, and a new payload fairing that made the booster almost four meters shorter than its ICBM version. Object D would later be launched as Sputnik 3 after the much lighter &#x27;Object PS&#x27; (Sputnik 1) was launched first. The trajectory of the launch vehicle and the satellite were initially calculated using arithmometers and six-digit trigonometric tables. More complex calculations were carried out on a newly-installed computer at the Academy of Sciences.

A special reconnaissance commission selected Tyuratam for the construction of a rocket proving ground, the 5th Tyuratam range, usually referred to as &quot;NIIP-5&quot;, or &quot;GIK-5&quot; in the post-Soviet time. The selection was approved on 12 February 1955 by the Council of Ministers of the USSR, but the site would not be completed until 1958. Actual work on the construction of the site began on 20 July by military building units.

The first launch of an R-7 rocket (8K71 No.5L) occurred on 15 May 1957. A fire began in the Blok D strap-on almost immediately at liftoff, but the booster continued flying until 98 seconds after launch when the strap-on broke away and the vehicle crashed downrange. Three attempts to launch the second rocket (8K71 No.6) were made on 10–11 June, but an assembly defect prevented launch. The unsuccessful launch of the third R-7 rocket (8K71 No.7) took place on 12 July. An electrical short caused the vernier engines to put the missile into an uncontrolled roll which resulted in all of the strap-ons separating 33 seconds into the launch. The R-7 crashed about from the pad.

The launch of the fourth rocket (8K71 No.8), on 21 August at 15:25 Moscow Time, was successful. The rocket&#x27;s core boosted the dummy warhead to the target altitude and velocity, reentered the atmosphere, and broke apart at a height of after traveling . On 27 August, the TASS issued a statement on the successful launch of a long-distance multistage ICBM. The launch of the fifth R-7 rocket (8K71 No.9), on 7 September, was also successful, but the dummy was also destroyed on atmospheric re-entry, and hence needed a redesign to completely fulfill its military purpose. The rocket, however, was deemed suitable for satellite launches, and Korolev was able to convince the State Commission to allow the use of the next R-7 to launch PS-1, allowing the delay in the rocket&#x27;s military exploitation to launch the PS-1 and PS-2 satellites.

On 22 September a modified R-7 rocket, named Sputnik and indexed as 8K71PS, arrived at the proving ground and preparations for the launch of PS-1 began. Compared to the military R-7 test vehicles, the mass of 8K71PS was reduced from , its length with PS-1 was and the thrust at liftoff was .

=== Observation complex ===
PS-1 was not designed to be controlled; it could only be observed. Initial data at the launch site would be collected at six separate observatories and telegraphed to NII-4. Located back in Moscow (at Bolshevo), NII-4 was a scientific research arm of the Ministry of Defence that was dedicated to missile development. The six observatories were clustered around the launch site, with the closest situated from the launch pad.

A second, nationwide observation complex was established to track the satellite after its separation from the rocket. Called the Command-Measurement Complex, it consisted of the coordination center in NII-4 and seven distant stations situated along the line of the satellite&#x27;s ground track. These tracking stations were located at Tyuratam, Sary-Shagan, Yeniseysk, Klyuchi, Yelizovo, Makat in Guryev Oblast, and Ishkup in Krasnoyarsk Krai. Stations were equipped with radar, optical instruments, and communications systems. Data from stations were transmitted by telegraphs into NII-4 where ballistics specialists calculated orbital parameters.

The observatories used a trajectory measurement system called &quot;Tral&quot;, developed by OKB MEI (Moscow Energy Institute), by which they received and monitored data from transponders mounted on the R-7 rocket&#x27;s core stage. The data were useful even after the satellite&#x27;s separation from the second stage of the rocket; Sputnik&#x27;s location was calculated from data on the location of the second stage, which followed Sputnik at a known distance. Tracking of the booster during launch had to be accomplished through purely passive means, such as visual coverage and radar detection. R-7 test launches demonstrated that the tracking cameras were only good up to an altitude of , but radar could track it for almost .
Outside the Soviet Union, the satellite was tracked by amateur radio operators in many countries. The booster rocket was located and tracked by the British using the Lovell Telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, the only telescope in the world able to do so by radar. Canada&#x27;s Newbrook Observatory was the first facility in North America to photograph Sputnik 1. 

== Design ==

Sputnik 1 was designed to meet a set of guidelines and objectives such as:

* Simplicity and reliability that could be adapted to future projects
* A spherical body to help determine atmospheric density from its lifetime in orbit
* Radio equipment to facilitate tracking and to obtain data on radio waves propagation through the atmosphere
* Verification of the satellite&#x27;s pressurization scheme

The chief constructor of Sputnik 1 at OKB-1 was Mikhail S. Khomyakov. The satellite was a diameter sphere, assembled from two hemispheres that were hermetically sealed with O-rings and connected by 36 bolts. It had a mass of . The hemispheres were 2 mm thick, and were covered with a highly polished 1 mm-thick heat shield made of an aluminium–magnesium–titanium alloy, AMG6T. The satellite carried two pairs of antennas designed by the Antenna Laboratory of OKB-1, led by Mikhail V. Krayushkin. Each antenna was made up of two whip-like parts, in length, and had an almost spherical radiation pattern.

The power supply, with a mass of , was in the shape of an octagonal nut with the radio transmitter in its hole. It consisted of three silver-zinc batteries, developed at the All-Union Research Institute of Power Sources (VNIIT) under the leadership of Nikolai S. Lidorenko. Two of these batteries powered the radio transmitter and one powered the temperature regulation system. The batteries had an expected lifetime of two weeks, and operated for 22 days. The power supply was turned on automatically at the moment of the satellite&#x27;s separation from the second stage of the rocket.

The satellite had a one-watt, radio transmitting unit inside, developed by Vyacheslav I. Lappo from &quot;NII-885&quot;, the Moscow Electronics Research Institute, that worked on two frequencies, 20.005 and 40.002 MHz. Signals on the first frequency were transmitted in 0.3 s pulses (near f = 3 Hz) (under normal temperature and pressure conditions on board), with pauses of the same duration filled by pulses on the second frequency. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere. Temperature and pressure were encoded in the duration of radio beeps. A temperature regulation system contained a fan, a dual thermal switch, and a control thermal switch. If the temperature inside the satellite exceeded , the fan was turned on; when it fell below , the fan was turned off by the dual thermal switch. If the temperature exceeded or fell below , another control thermal switch was activated, changing the duration of the radio signal pulses. Sputnik &quot;1&quot; was filled with dry nitrogen, pressurized to . The satellite had a barometric switch, activated if the pressure inside the satellite fell below 130 kPa, which would have indicated failure of the pressure vessel or puncture by a meteor, and would have changed the duration of radio signal impulse.

While attached to the rocket, Sputnik 1 was protected by a cone-shaped payload fairing, with a height of . The fairing separated from both Sputnik and the spent R-7 second stage at the same time as the satellite was ejected. Tests of the satellite were conducted at OKB-1 under the leadership of Oleg G. Ivanovsky.

== Launch and mission ==

The control system of the Sputnik rocket was adjusted to an intended orbit of , with an orbital period of 101.5 minutes. The trajectory had been calculated earlier by Georgi Grechko, using the USSR Academy of Sciences&#x27; mainframe computer.

The Sputnik rocket was launched on 4 October 1957 at 19:28:34 UTC (5 October at the launch site) from Site No.1 at NIIP-5. Telemetry indicated that the strap-ons separated 116 seconds into the flight and the core stage engine shut down 295.4 seconds into the flight. At shutdown, the 7.5-tonne core stage (with PS-1 attached) had attained an altitude of above sea level, a velocity of , and a velocity vector inclination to the local horizon of 0 degrees 24 minutes. This resulted in an initial elliptical orbit of by , with an apogee approximately lower than intended, and an inclination of 65.10° and a period of 96.20 minutes.

Several engines did not fire on time, almost aborting the mission. A fuel regulator in the booster also failed around 16 seconds into launch, which resulted in excessive RP-1 consumption for most of the powered flight and the engine thrust being 4% above nominal. Core stage cutoff was intended for T+296 seconds, but the premature propellant depletion caused thrust termination to occur one second earlier when a sensor detected overspeed of the empty RP-1 turbopump. There were of LOX remaining at cutoff.

At 19.9 seconds after engine cut-off, PS-1 separated from the second stage and the satellite&#x27;s transmitter was activated. These signals were detected at the IP-1 station by Junior Engineer-Lieutenant V.G. Borisov, where reception of Sputnik 1&#x27;s &quot;beep-beep-beep&quot; tones confirmed the satellite&#x27;s successful deployment. Reception lasted for two minutes, until PS-1 passed below the horizon. The Tral telemetry system on the R-7 core stage continued to transmit and was detected on its second orbit.

The designers, engineers, and technicians who developed the rocket and satellite watched the launch from the range. After the launch they drove to the mobile radio station to listen for signals from the satellite. They waited about 90 minutes to ensure that the satellite had made one orbit and was transmitting before Korolev called Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev.

On the first orbit the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS) transmitted: &quot;As result of great, intense work of scientific institutes and design bureaus the first artificial Earth satellite has been built&quot;. The R-7 core stage, with a mass of 7.5 tonnes and a length of 26 metres, also reached Earth orbit. It was a first magnitude object following behind the satellite and visible at night. Deployable reflective panels were placed on the booster in order to increase its visibility for tracking. A small highly polished sphere, the satellite was barely visible at sixth magnitude, and thus harder to follow optically. The batteries ran out on 26 October 1957, after the satellite completed 326 orbits.

The core stage of the R-7 remained in orbit for two months until 2 December 1957, while Sputnik 1 orbited for three months, until 4 January 1958, having completed 1,440 orbits of the Earth.

== Reception ==
Organized through the citizen science project Operation Moonwatch, teams of visual observers at 150 stations in the United States and other countries were alerted during the night to watch for the satellite at dawn and during the evening twilight as it passed overhead. The USSR requested amateur and professional radio operators to tape record the signal being transmitted from the satellite. One of the first observations of it in the western world were made at the school observatory in Rodewisch (Saxony).

News reports at the time pointed out that &quot;anyone possessing a short wave receiver can hear the new Russian earth satellite as it hurtles over this area of the globe.&quot; Directions, provided by the American Radio Relay League, were to &quot;Tune in 20 megacycles sharply, by the time signals, given on that frequency. Then tune to slightly higher frequencies. The &#x27;beep, beep&#x27; sound of the satellite can be heard each time it rounds the globe.&quot; The first recording of Sputnik 1&#x27;s signal was made by RCA engineers near Riverhead, Long Island. They then drove the tape recording into Manhattan for broadcast to the public over NBC radio. However, as Sputnik rose higher over the East Coast, its signal was picked up by W2AEE, the ham radio station of Columbia University. Students working in the university&#x27;s FM station, WKCR, made a tape of this, and were the first to rebroadcast the Sputnik signal to the American public (or whoever could receive the FM station).

The Soviet Union agreed to transmit on frequencies that worked with the United States&#x27; existing infrastructure, but later announced the lower frequencies. Asserting that the launch &quot;did not come as a surprise&quot;, the White House refused to comment on any military aspects. On 5 October, the Naval Research Laboratory captured recordings of Sputnik 1 during four crossings over the United States. The USAF Cambridge Research Center collaborated with Bendix-Friez, Westinghouse Broadcasting, and the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory to obtain a video of Sputnik&#x27;s rocket body crossing the pre-dawn sky of Baltimore, broadcast on 12 October by WBZ-TV in Boston.

The success of Sputnik 1 seemed to have changed minds around the world regarding a shift in power to the Soviets.

The USSR&#x27;s launch of Sputnik 1 spurred the United States to create the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA, later DARPA) in February 1958 to regain a technological lead.

In Britain, the media and population initially reacted with a mixture of fear for the future, but also amazement about human progress. Many newspapers and magazines heralded the arrival of the Space Age. However, when the USSR launched Sputnik 2, containing the dog Laika, the media narrative returned to one of anti-Communism and many people sent protests to the Soviet embassy and the RSPCA.

=== Propaganda ===

Sputnik 1 was not immediately used for Soviet propaganda. The Soviets had kept quiet about their earlier accomplishments in rocketry, fearing that it would lead to secrets being revealed and failures being exploited by the West. When the Soviets began using Sputnik in their propaganda, they emphasized pride in the achievement of Soviet technology, arguing that it demonstrated the Soviets&#x27; superiority over the West. People were encouraged to listen to Sputnik&#x27;s signals on the radio and to look out for Sputnik in the night sky. While Sputnik itself had been highly polished, its small size made it barely visible to the naked eye. What most watchers actually saw was the much more visible 26-metre core stage of the R-7. Shortly after the launch of PS-1, Khrushchev pressed Korolev to launch another satellite to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, on 7 November 1957.

The launch of Sputnik 1 surprised the American public, and shattered the perception created by American propaganda of the United States as the technological superpower, and the Soviet Union as a backward country. Privately, however, the CIA and President Eisenhower were aware of progress being made by the Soviets on Sputnik from secret spy plane imagery. Together with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), the Army Ballistic Missile Agency built Explorer 1, and launched it on 31 January 1958. Before work was completed, however, the Soviet Union launched a second satellite, Sputnik 2, on 3 November 1957. Meanwhile, the televised failure of &quot;Vanguard TV-3&quot; on 6 December 1957 deepened American dismay over the country&#x27;s position in the Space Race. The Americans took a more aggressive stance in the emerging space race, resulting in an emphasis on science and technological research, and reforms in many areas from the military to education systems. The federal government began investing in science, engineering, and mathematics at all levels of education. An advanced research group was assembled for military purposes. These research groups developed weapons such as ICBMs and missile defense systems, as well as spy satellites for the U.S.

== Legacy ==

Initially, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower was not surprised by Sputnik 1. He had been forewarned of the R-7&#x27;s capabilities by information derived from U-2 spy plane overflight photos, as well as signals and telemetry intercepts. General James M. Gavin wrote in 1958 that he had predicted to the Army Scientific Advisory Panel on 12 September 1957 that the Soviets would launch a satellite within 30 days, and that on 4 October he and Wernher von Braun had agreed that a launch was imminent. The Eisenhower administration&#x27;s first response was low-key and almost dismissive. Eisenhower was even pleased that the USSR, not the U.S., would be the first to test the waters of the still-uncertain legal status of orbital satellite overflights. Eisenhower had suffered the Soviet protests and shoot-downs of Project Genetrix (Moby Dick) balloons and was concerned about the probability of a U-2 being shot down. To set a precedent for &quot;freedom of space&quot; before the launch of America&#x27;s secret WS-117L spy satellites, the U.S. had launched Project Vanguard as its own &quot;civilian&quot; satellite entry for the International Geophysical Year. Eisenhower greatly underestimated the reaction of the American public, who were shocked by the launch of Sputnik and by the televised failure of the Vanguard Test Vehicle 3 launch attempt. The sense of anxiety was inflamed by Democratic politicians, who portrayed the United States as woefully behind. One of the many books that suddenly appeared for the lay-audience noted seven points of &quot;impact&quot; upon the nation: Western leadership, Western strategy and tactics, missile production, applied research, basic research, education, and democratic culture. As public and the government became interested in space and related science and technology, the phenomenon was sometimes dubbed the &quot;Sputnik craze&quot;.
The U.S. soon had a number of successful satellites, including Explorer 1, Project SCORE, and Courier 1B. However, public reaction to the Sputnik crisis spurred America to action in the Space Race, leading to the creation of both the Advanced Research Projects Agency (renamed the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA, in 1972), and NASA (through the National Aeronautics and Space Act), as well as increased U.S. government spending on scientific research and education through the National Defense Education Act.

Sputnik also contributed directly to a new emphasis on science and technology in American schools. With a sense of urgency, Congress enacted the 1958 National Defense Education Act, which provided low-interest loans for college tuition to students majoring in mathematics and science. After the launch of Sputnik, a poll conducted and published by the University of Michigan showed that 26% of Americans surveyed thought that Russian sciences and engineering were superior to that of the United States. (A year later, however, that figure had dropped to 10% as the U.S. began launching its own satellites into space.)

One consequence of the Sputnik shock was the perception of a &quot;missile gap&quot;. This became a dominant issue in the 1960 presidential campaign.

The Communist Party newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; only printed a few paragraphs about Sputnik 1 on 4 October.

Sputnik also inspired a generation of engineers and scientists. Harrison Storms, the North American designer who was responsible for the X-15 rocket plane, and went on to head the effort to design the Apollo command and service module and Saturn V launch vehicle&#x27;s second stage, was moved by the launch of Sputnik to think of space as being the next step for America. Astronauts Alan Shepard (who was the first American in space) and Deke Slayton later wrote of how the sight of Sputnik 1 passing overhead inspired them to their new careers.

The launch of Sputnik 1 led to the resurgence of the suffix &quot;-nik&quot; in the English language. The American writer Herb Caen was inspired to coin the term &quot;beatnik&quot; in an article about the Beat Generation in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; on 2 April 1958.

The flag of the Russian city of Kaluga, (which, due to it being Konstantin Tsiolkovsky&#x27;s place of work and residency, is very dedicated to space and space travel) features a small Sputnik in the canton.

On 3 October 2007 Google celebrated Sputnik&#x27;s 50th anniversary with a Google Doodle.

=== Satellite navigation ===

The launch of Sputnik also planted the seeds for the development of modern satellite navigation. Two American physicists, William Guier and George Weiffenbach, at Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) decided to monitor Sputnik&#x27;s radio transmissions and within hours realized that, because of the Doppler effect, they could pinpoint where the satellite was along its orbit. The Director of the APL gave them access to their UNIVAC computer to do the then heavy calculations required.

Early the next year, Frank McClure, the deputy director of the APL, asked Guier and Weiffenbach to investigate the inverse problem: pinpointing the user&#x27;s location, given the satellite&#x27;s. At the time, the Navy was developing the submarine-launched Polaris missile, which required them to know the submarine&#x27;s location. This led them and APL to develop the TRANSIT system, a forerunner of modern Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites.

== Surviving examples ==
===Backups===
At least two vintage duplicates of Sputnik 1 exist, built apparently as backup units. The first resides near Moscow in the corporate museum of Energia, the modern descendant of Korolev&#x27;s design bureau, where it is on display by appointment only. The second is a flight-ready backup at the Cosmosphere space museum in Hutchinson, Kansas, which also has an engineering model of the Sputnik 2. 

===Models===
The Museum of Flight in Seattle, Washington has a Sputnik 1, but it has no internal components, though it does have casings and molded fittings inside (as well as evidence of battery wear), which may be an engineering model. Authenticated by the Memorial Museum of Cosmonautics in Moscow, the unit was auctioned in 2001 and purchased by an anonymous private buyer, who donated it to the museum.

The Sputnik 1 EMC/EMI is a class of full-scale laboratory models of the satellite. The models, manufactured by OKB-1 and NII-885 (headed by Mikhail Ryazansky), were introduced on 15 February 1957. They were made to test ground electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and electromagnetic interference (EMI).

===Replicas===
In 1959, the Soviet Union donated a replica of Sputnik to the United Nations. There are other full-size Sputnik replicas (with varying degrees of accuracy) on display in locations around the world, including the National Air and Space Museum in the United States, the Science Museum in the United Kingdom, the Powerhouse Museum in Australia, and outside the Russian embassy in Spain.

Three one-third scale student-built replicas of Sputnik 1 were deployed from the Mir space station between 1997 and 1999. The first, named Sputnik 40 to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the launch of Sputnik 1, was deployed in November 1997. Sputnik 41 was launched a year later, and Sputnik 99 was deployed in February 1999. A fourth replica was launched, but never deployed, and was destroyed when Mir was deorbited.

===Private owners===
Two more Sputniks are claimed to be in the personal collections of American entrepreneurs Richard Garriott and Jay S. Walker.

<text>Steve Jackson Games (SJGames) is a game company, founded in 1980 by Steve Jackson, that creates and publishes role-playing, board, and card games, and (until 2019) the gaming magazine &quot;Pyramid&quot;.

==History==
Founded in 1980, six years after the creation of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, SJ Games created several role-playing and strategy games with science fiction themes. SJ Games&#x27; early titles were microgames initially sold in 4×7 inch Ziploc bags, and later in the similarly sized Pocket Box. Games such as &quot;Ogre&quot;, &quot;Car Wars&quot;, &quot;Illuminati&quot;, and &quot;G.E.V&quot; (an &quot;Ogre&quot; spin-off) were popular during SJ Games&#x27; early years. Game designers such as Loren Wiseman and Jonathan Leistiko have worked for Steve Jackson Games.

Today SJ Games publishes a variety of games, such as card games, board games, strategy games, and in different genres, such as fantasy, sci-fi, and gothic horror. They also published the book &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;, the sacred text of the Discordian religion.

===Raid by the Secret Service===

On March 1, 1990, the Secret Service raided the offices of Steve Jackson Games, seizing three computers, two laser printers, dozens of floppy disks, and the master copy of &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot;; a genre toolkit for cyberpunk games, written by Loyd Blankenship, an employee at the time. The Secret Service believed that Blankenship had illegally accessed Bell South systems, and uploaded a document possibly affecting 9-1-1 systems onto Steve Jackson Games&#x27;s public bulletin board system and/or another board known as Phoenix which he also administered; and, furthermore, that &quot;GURPS Cyberpunk&quot; would help others commit computer crimes. During their investigation, the Secret Service also read (and deleted) private emails on one of the computers. Though the materials were later returned in June, Steve Jackson Games filed suit in federal court, winning at trial.

The raid led to the formation of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which was founded in July 1990.

===Kickstarter project===
In April–May 2012, Steve Jackson Games ran a successful Kickstarter campaign for a new &quot;Designer&#x27;s Edition&quot; of &quot;Ogre&quot;. The final game was planned to weigh 14 pounds or more, partly because the high level of extra funding achieved in the Kickstarter enabled significant game additions.

==Mentions in third-party media==
In &quot;Uplink&quot;, a 2001 computer hacking simulation game by British software company Introversion Software, there is a company named Steve Jackson Games. While this company may occasionally offer hacking contracts to the player, its main feature is a Public Access Server which, if accessed, displays the following information:

Steve Jackson Games
Public Access Server

This jokingly refers to the 1990 raid by the US Secret Service. As noted in the Ultimate Uplink Guide, this was &quot;put into the game because of the Secret Service Raid on the company, for supposedly making a &#x27;Hacking Guide&#x27;. This guide was actually a work of total fiction for a game the company was making, and contained technology that didn&#x27;t even exist&quot;.

<text>Stella Artois ( , ) is a pilsner beer, first brewed in 1926 by Brouwerij Artois in Leuven, Belgium. In its original form, the beer is 5.2 per cent ABV, the country&#x27;s standard for pilsners. The beer is sold in many EU countries, but also in the US, UK, Canada and Australia, where it has a reduced ABV. Stella Artois is owned by Interbrew International B.V. which is a subsidiary of the world&#x27;s largest brewer, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV.

==History==
The Den Hoorn brewery in Leuven opened in 1366, when it was a tavern brewing its own beer for sale under the sign of a hunting horn. In 1708, Sébastien Artois became head brewer; then, in 1717, purchased the brewery, renaming it Brouwerij Artois.

In 1926, Brouwerij Artois launched Stella as a Christmas beer, named after the Christmas star. First sold in the winter season, it eventually became available year-round, with exports into the broad European market commencing in 1930, though it did not reach the entire market until 1964. Production was halted for a period when operations were suspended during World War II. By 1960, about of Stella Artois were being produced annually. Whitbread secured a licence to brew Stella Artois under contract in the United Kingdom in 1976.

In 1988, Brouwerij Artois was a founding member in the merger creating Interbrew. That year, Taylorbrands founder David Taylor created a new package design, bottle design, and shape. The original 1926 bottle label inspired the design, which replaced a 1960s design. The design incorporates the horn symbol and the 1366 date of the original Den Hoorn brewery. The label also shows medals for excellence awarded to Brouwerij Artois at a number of trade exhibitions in Belgium in the 19th and 20th centuries. The name Stella Artois is held within a cartouche which was influenced by the style of Belgian architecture in Leuven.

In 1993, Interbrew moved production of Stella Artois into a new, fully automated brewery in Leuven. In 2004, Interbrew was part of the merger creating InBev, and by 2006, total annual production volume of Stella Artois exceeded one billion litres.

In 2008, InBev was part of the merger creating the Anheuser-Busch InBev (AB InBev) brewery company. That same year, a lower-alcohol version, Stella Artois 4%, was introduced in the UK market. In 2011, a cider, Stella Artois Cidre, was launched.

In 2020, AB InBev reduced the alcohol content of their beers for the UK market, from 4.8% to 4.6%. The original UK strength of Stella Artois was 5.2% and 4.8% from 2008 until 2020. According to Freddy Delvaux, former head of the in-house laboratory, the Belgian version was 33 IBU when he joined the lab in 1973, compared to just 20 IBU in 2014.

==Production==
Stella Artois is brewed in Belgium (in the plants at Leuven and Jupille), at Samlesbury and Magor in the United Kingdom, as well as in other countries. Much of the beer exported from Europe is produced at InBev&#x27;s brewery in Belgium, and packaged in the Beck&#x27;s Brewery in Bremen, Germany. Stella Artois is also brewed for the Australian market by Lion. In the United States, Stella Artois is brewed and distributed by Anheuser-Busch at its various brewing facilities in the US, beginning in 2021 and before then it was imported. For the Hungarian market, Stella Artois is brewed in Bőcs, Hungary, by Borsod Brewery, under licence from InBev. For the Canadian market is brewed by Labatt Brewery in Ontario, Canada.

Stella Artois is available on draught and in several packaged sizes.

An unfiltered version was introduced to the United Kingdom market in 2022.

==Advertising==
===United Kingdom===
Initially, brewers Whitbread launched Stella in the UK with advertisements featuring the slogan &quot;Stella&#x27;s for the fellas who take their lager strong&quot;. The images showed a Stella-monogrammed half-pint glass (due to its strength) – in one advertisement with a muscular &#x27;glass arm&#x27; for a handle, in the other a glass sitting beside a torn-in-half telephone directory. This was the same creative unit which was involved, at the time, in Whitbread&#x27;s launch of Trophy Bitter &quot;The pint that thinks it&#x27;s a quart&quot;.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the Stella Artois advertising slogan in the United Kingdom was &quot;Reassuringly Expensive&quot;. The UK television advertising campaigns became known for their distinctive style of imitating European cinema and their leitmotiv inspired by Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La forza del destino&quot;. The campaigns began with a series of advertisements based on the 1986 French film &quot;Jean de Florette&quot;, directed by the British duo Anthea Benton and Vaughan Arnell, moving on to other genres, including war films, silent comedy and surrealism. They have used notable film directors such as Jonathan Glazer. Furthermore, the brand makes extensive use of the French language in its advertising campaigns, even though the beer brand originates from the monolingual Dutch-speaking city of Leuven. An example of this can be seen in the advertising campaign for Stella Artois Cidre, in which the tag-line &quot;C&#x27;est cidre, not cider&quot; is used, although this cider is produced in Zonhoven, which also lies in the Dutch-speaking Flemish Region.

Stella Artois is advertised as containing &quot;only 4 ingredients: hops, malted barley, maize and water&quot;. Yeast is also an ingredient used in the fermentation process, but almost all of it is removed before packaging. Since 2009, Stella Artois has been suitable for vegans, as isinglass (fish bladder) is no longer used to remove trace amounts of yeast.

==Brand image==
At least since the early 21st century, Stella Artois has carried the nickname of the &quot;wife beater&quot; in the United Kingdom, due to a perceived connection between binge drinking involving the brand and domestic violence against women. In January 2012, the online activities of AB InBev lobbyists, Portland Communications, were exposed in the United Kingdom when Tom Watson, a member of the Labour opposition party said that the company (then owned by Tim Allan, a former advisor to ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair) was trying to remove references to Stella Artois from Wikipedia&#x27;s &quot;wife beater&quot; disambiguation page and the phrase &quot;wife beater&quot; from this article.

==Marketing==
Stella Artois has been associated with film in the UK since 1994, organising events, sponsoring television, and hosting a website. Stella Artois has been or is a primary sponsor of the Cannes, Melbourne, and Sundance film festivals, the Independent Spirit Awards, the Dallas International Film Festival, and the Little Rock Film Festival.

Stella Artois has broadcast several Super Bowl ads, as part of Anheuser–Busch InBev&#x27;s overall ad buys during the game. The brand made its debut during Super Bowl XLV in 2011, in an ad starring Adrien Brody. The commercial was heavily criticised in the Belgian media for giving the impression that the beer is French.

<text>The Suebi (also spelled Suavi, Suevi or Suebians) were a large group of Germanic peoples originally from the Elbe river region in what is now Germany and Czechia. In the early Roman era they included many peoples with their own names such as the Marcomanni, Quadi, Hermunduri, Semnones, and Lombards. New groupings formed later, such as the Alamanni and Bavarians, and two kingdoms in the Migration Period were simply referred to as Suebian.

Although Tacitus specified that the Suebian group was not an old tribal group itself, the Suebian peoples are associated by Pliny the Elder with the Irminones, a grouping of Germanic peoples who claimed ancestral connections. Tacitus mentions Suebian languages, and a geographical &quot;Suevia&quot;.

The Suevians were first mentioned by Julius Caesar in connection with the invasion of Gaul led by the Germanic king Ariovistus during the Gallic Wars. Unlike Strabo and Tacitus who wrote later, he described them as a single people, distinct from the Marcomanni, within the larger Germanic category, who he saw as a growing threat to Gaul and Italy in the first century BC, as they had been moving southwards aggressively, at the expense of Gallic tribes, and establishing a Germanic presence in the immediate areas north of the Danube. In particular, Caesar saw the Suebians as the most warlike of the Germanic peoples.

During the reign of Augustus the first emperor, Rome made aggressive campaigns into Germania, east of the Rhine and north of the Danube, pushing towards the Elbe. After suffering a major defeat to the Romans in 9 BC, Maroboduus became king of a Suevian kingdom which was established within the protective mountains and forests of Bohemia. The Suevians did not join the alliance led by Arminius.

In 69 AD the Suebian kings Italicus and Sido provided support to the Flavian faction under Vespasian.

Under the reign of Marcus Aurelius in the 2nd century AD, the Marcomanni, perhaps under pressure from East Germanic tribes to their north, invaded Italy.

By the Crisis of the Third Century, new Suebian groups had emerged, and Italy was invaded again by the Juthungi, while the Alamanni ravaged Gaul and settled the Agri Decumates. The Alamanni continued exerting pressure on Gaul, while the Alamannic chieftain Chrocus played an important role in elevating Constantine the Great to Roman emperor.

By the late 4th century AD, the Middle Danubian frontier inhabited by the Quadi and Marcomanni received large numbers of Gothic and other eastern peoples escaping disturbances associated with the Huns. In 406 AD, Suebian tribes led by Hermeric, together with other Danubian groups including Alans and Vandals, crossed the Rhine and overran Gaul and Hispania. They eventually established the Kingdom of the Suebi in Galicia. With the breaking up of Hunnic power after the Battle of Nedao there was also a short-lived Kingdom of the Suebi on the Danube, under Hunimund. They were defeated by the Ostrogoths, one of the peoples of eastern origin who had been allies of the Huns. In the sixth century the Suevic Longobards moved from the Elbe to become one of the major powers of the Middle Danube, in competition with the dynasties from the east such as the Herules, Gepids and Ostrogoths.

During the last years of the decline of the Western Roman Empire, the Suebian general Ricimer was its de facto ruler. The Lombards, with many Danubian peoples both Suebian and eastern, later settled Italy and established the Kingdom of the Lombards.

The Alamanni, Bavarii and Thuringii who remained in Germania gave their names to the still-existing German regions of Swabia, Bavaria and Thuringia respectively. Suebian languages are thought to be a main source of the later High German languages, especially the Upper-German dialects predominant in Southern Germany, Switzerland and Austria, which experienced the Second consonant shift some time after about 600 AD.

==Etymology==
Etymologists trace the name from Proto-Germanic *&quot;swēbaz&quot; based on the Proto-Germanic root *&quot;swē-&quot; found in the third-person reflexive pronoun, giving the meaning &quot;one&#x27;s own&quot; people, in turn from an earlier Indo-European root &quot;*swe-&quot; (Polish &quot;swe, swój, swoi,&quot; Latin &quot;sui,&quot; Italian &quot;suo, &quot; Sanskrit &quot;swa&quot;, each meaning &quot;one&#x27;s own&quot;).

The etymological sources list the following ethnic names as being from the same root: Suiones (whence also the name of the Swedes), Samnites, Sabellians, Sabines, and, according to one of the hypotheses, Slavs, indicating the possibility of a prior more extended and common Indo-European ethnic name, &quot;our own people&quot;. Notably, the Semnones, known to classical authors as one of the largest Suebian groups, also seem to have a name with this same meaning, but recorded with a different pronunciation by the Romans.

Alternatively, it may be borrowed from a Celtic word for &quot;vagabond&quot;.
==Classification==
===More than one tribe===
Caesar placed the Suebi east of the Ubii apparently near modern Hesse, in the position where later writers mention the Chatti, and he distinguished them from their allies the Marcomanni. Some commentators believe that Caesar&#x27;s Suebi were the later Chatti or possibly the Hermunduri, or Semnones. Later authors use the term &quot;Suebi&quot; more broadly, &quot;to cover a large number of tribes in central Germany&quot;.

While Caesar treated them as one Germanic tribe within an alliance, albeit the largest and most warlike one, later authors, such as Tacitus, Pliny the Elder and Strabo, specified that the Suevi &quot;do not, like the Chatti or Tencteri, constitute a single nation. They actually occupy more than half of Germania, and are divided into a number of distinct tribes under distinct names, though all generally are called Suebi&quot;. Although no classical authors explicitly call the Chatti Suevic, Pliny the Elder (23 AD – 79 AD), reported in his &quot;Natural History&quot; that the Irminones were a large grouping of related Germanic &quot;gentes&quot; or &quot;tribes&quot; including not only the Suebi, but also the Hermunduri, Chatti and Cherusci. Whether or not the Chatti were ever considered Suevi, both Tacitus and Strabo distinguish the two partly because the Chatti were more settled in one territory, whereas Suevi remained less settled.

The definitions of the greater ethnic groupings within Germania were apparently not always consistent and clear, especially in the case of mobile groups such as the Suevi. Whereas Tacitus reported three main kinds of German peoples, Irminones, Istvaeones, and Ingaevones, Pliny specifically adds two more &quot;genera&quot; or &quot;kinds&quot;, the Bastarnae and the Vandili (Vandals). The Vandals were tribes east of the Elbe, including the well-known Silingi, Goths, and Burgundians, an area that Tacitus treated as Suebic. That the Vandals might be a separate type of Germanic people, corresponding to the modern concept of East Germanic, is a possibility that Tacitus also noted, but for example the Varini are named as Vandilic by Pliny, and specifically Suebic by Tacitus.

At one time, classical ethnography had applied the name &quot;Suevi&quot; to so many Germanic tribes that it appeared as if, in the first centuries AD, that native name would replace the foreign name &quot;Germans&quot;.

The modern term &quot;Elbe Germanic&quot; similarly covers a large grouping of Germanic peoples that at least overlaps with the classical terms &quot;Suevi&quot; and &quot;Irminones&quot;. However, this term was developed mainly as an attempt to define the ancient peoples who must have spoken the Germanic dialects that led to modern Upper German dialects spoken in Austria, Bavaria, Thuringia, Alsace, Baden-Württemberg and German speaking Switzerland. This was proposed by Friedrich Maurer as one of five major &quot;Kulturkreise&quot; or &quot;culture-groups&quot; whose dialects developed in the southern German area from the first century BC through to the fourth century AD. Apart from his own linguistic work with modern dialects, he also referred to the archaeological and literary analysis of Germanic tribes done earlier by Gustaf Kossinna In terms of these proposed ancient dialects, the Vandals, Goths and Burgundians are generally referred to as members of the Eastern Germanic group, distinct from the Elbe Germanic.

===Tribes names in classical sources===

====Northern bank of the Danube====
In the time of Caesar, southern Germany had a mixture of Celtic and Germanic tribes and was increasingly coming under pressure from Germanic groups led by the Suebi. As described later by Tacitus, what is today southern Germany between the Danube, the Main, and the Rhine had been deserted by the departure of two large Celtic nations, the Helvetii in modern Schwaben and the Boii further east near the Hercynian forest. In addition, near the Hercynian forest Caesar believed that the Celtic Tectosages had once lived. All of these peoples had for the most part moved by the time of Tacitus. Nevertheless, Cassius Dio wrote that the Suebi, who dwelt across the Rhine, were called Celts. This may follow a Greek tradition of labelling all barbarian people north of the Alps as Celtic.

Strabo (64/63 BC – c. 24 AD), in Book IV (6.9) of his &quot;Geography&quot; also associates the Suebi with the Hercynian Forest and the south of Germania north of the Danube. He describes a chain of mountains north of the Danube that is like a lower extension of the Alps, possibly the Swabian Alps, and further east the Gabreta Forest, possibly the modern Bohemian forest. In Book VII (1.3) Strabo specifically mentions as Suevic peoples the Marcomanni, who under King Marobodus had moved into the same Hercynian forest as the Coldui (possibly the Quadi), taking over an area called &quot;Boihaemum&quot;. This king &quot;took the rulership and acquired, in addition to the peoples aforementioned, the Lugii (a large tribe), the Zumi, the Butones, the Mugilones, the Sibini, and also the Semnones, a large tribe of the Suevi themselves&quot;. Some of these tribes were &quot;inside the forest&quot; and some &quot;outside of it&quot;. Tacitus confirms the name &quot;Boiemum&quot;, saying it was a survival marking the old traditional population of the place, the Celtic Boii, though the population had changed.

Tacitus describes a series of very powerful Suebian states in his own time, running along the north of the Danube which was the frontier with Rome, and stretching into the lands where the Elbe originates in the modern day Czech Republic. Going from west to east the first were the Hermunduri, living near the sources of the Elbe and stretching across the Danube into Roman Rhaetia. Next came the Naristi, the Marcomanni, and then the Quadi. The Quadi are on the edge of greater Suebia, having the Sarmatians to the southeast.

Claudius Ptolemy the geographer did not always state which tribes were Suebi, but along the northern bank of the Danube, from west to east and starting at the &quot;desert&quot; formerly occupied by the Helvetii, he names the Parmaecampi, then the Adrabaecampi, and then a &quot;large people&quot; known as the Baemoi (whose name appears to recall the Boii again), and then the Racatriae. North of the Baemoi, is the Luna forest which has iron mines, and which is south of the Quadi. North of the Adrabaecampi, are the Sudini and then the Marcomanni living in the Gambreta forest. North of them, but south of the Sudetes mountains (which are not likely to be the same as the modern ones of that name) are the Varisti, who are probably the same as Tacitus&#x27; &quot;Naristi&quot; mentioned above.

Jordanes writes that in the early 4th century the Vandals had moved to the north of the Danube, but with the Marcomanni still to their west, and the Hermunduri still to their north. A possible sign of confusion in this comment is that he equates the area in question to later Gepidia, which was further south, in Pannonia, modern Hungary, and east of the Danube. In general, as discussed below, the Danubian Suebi, along with the neighbours such as the Vandals, apparently moved southwards into Roman territories, both south and east of the Danube, during this period.

====Approaching the Rhine====
Caesar describes the Suebi as pressing the German tribes of the Rhine, such as the Tencteri, Usipetes and Ubii, from the east, forcing them from their homes. While emphasizing their warlike nature he writes as if they had a settled homeland somewhere between the Cherusci and the Ubii, and separated from the Cherusci by a deep forest called the Silva Bacenis. He also describes the Marcomanni as a tribe distinct from the Suebi, and also active within the same alliance. But he does not describe where they were living.

Strabo wrote that the Suebi &quot;excel all the others in power and numbers.&quot; He describes Suebic peoples (Greek &quot;ethnē&quot;) as having come to dominate Germany between the Rhine and Elbe, with the exception of the Rhine valley, on the frontier with the Roman empire, and the &quot;coastal&quot; regions north of the Rhine.

The geographer Ptolemy (c. AD 90 – c. AD 168), in a fairly extensive account of Greater Germany, makes several unusual mentions of Suebi between the Rhine and the Elbe. He describes their position as stretching out in a band from the Elbe, all the way to the northern Rhine, near the Sugambri. The &quot;Suevi Langobardi&quot; are the Suevi located closest to the Rhine, far to the east of where most sources report them. To the east of the Langobardi, are the &quot;Suevi Angili&quot;, extending as far north as the middle Elbe, also to the east of the position reported in other sources. It has been speculated that Ptolemy may have been confused by his sources, or else that this position of the Langobardi represented a particular moment in history.

As discussed below, in the third century a large group of Suebi, also referred to as the Allemanni, moved up to the Rhine bank in modern Schwaben, which had previously been controlled by the Romans. They competed in this region with Burgundians who had arrived from further east.

====The Elbe====

Strabo does not say much about the Suebi east of the Elbe, saying that this region was still unknown to Romans, but mentions that a part of the Suebi live there, naming only specifically the Hermunduri and the Langobardi. But he mentions these are there because of recent defeats at Roman hands which had forced them over the river. (Tacitus mentions that the Hermunduri were later welcomed on to the Roman border at the Danube.) In any case he says that the area near the Elbe itself is held by the Suebi.

From Tacitus and Ptolemy we can derive more details:
* The Semnones are described by Tacitus as &quot;the oldest and noblest of the Suebi&quot;, and, like the Suebi described by Caesar, they have 100 cantons. Tacitus says that &quot;the vastness of their community makes them regard themselves as the head of the Suevic race&quot;. According to Ptolemy the &quot;Suevi Semnones&quot; live upon the Elbe and stretch as far east as a river apparently named after them, the Suevus, probably the Oder. South of them he places the Silingi, and then, again upon the Elbe, the Calucones. To the southeast further up the upper Elbe he places not the Hermunduri mentioned by other authors (who had possibly moved westwards and become Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Teuriochaemai&quot;, and the later Thuringii), but the Baenochaemae (whose name appears to be somehow related to the modern name Bohemia, and somehow derived from the older placename mentioned by Strabo and Tacitus as the capital of King Marobodus after he settled his Marcomanni in the Hercynian forest). A monument confirms that the Juthungi, who fought the Romans in the 3rd century, and were associated with the Alamanni, were Semnones. 
* The Langobardi live a bit further from Rome&#x27;s borders, in &quot;scanty numbers&quot; but &quot;surrounded by a host of most powerful tribes&quot; and kept safe &quot;by daring the perils of war&quot; according to Tacitus. 
* Tacitus names seven tribes who live &quot;next&quot; after the Langobardi, &quot;fenced in by rivers or forests&quot; stretching &quot;into the remoter regions of Germany&quot;. These all worshiped Nertha, or Mother Earth, whose sacred grove was on an island in the Ocean (presumably the Baltic Sea): Reudigni, Aviones, Anglii, Varini, Eudoses, Suarini and Nuitones. 
*At the mouth of the Elbe (and in the Danish peninsula), the classical authors do not place any Suevi, but rather the Chauci to the west of the Elbe, and the Saxons to the east, and in the &quot;neck&quot; of the peninsula.

Note that while various errors and confusions are possible, Ptolemy places the Angles and Langobardi west of the Elbe, where they may indeed have been present at some points in time, given that the Suebi were often mobile.

====East of the Elbe====
It is already mentioned above that stretching between the Elbe and the Oder, the classical authors place the Suebic Semnones. Ptolemy places the Silingi to their south in the stretch between these rivers. These Silingi appear in later history as a branch of the Vandals, and were therefore likely to be speakers of East Germanic dialects. Their name is associated with medieval Silesia. Further south on the Elbe are the Baenochaemae and between them and the Askibourgian mountains Ptolemy names a tribe called the Batini (Βατεινοὶ), apparently north and/or east of the Elbe.

According to Tacitus, around the north of the Danubian Marcomanni and Quadi, &quot;dwelling in forests and on mountain-tops&quot;, live the Marsigni, and Buri, who &quot;in their language and manner of life, resemble the Suevi&quot;. (Living partly subject to the Quadi are the Gotini and Osi, who Tacitus says speak respectively Gaulish and Pannonian, and are therefore not Germans.) Ptolemy also places the &quot;Lugi Buri&quot; in mountains, along with a tribe called the Corconti. These mountains, stretching from near the upper Elbe to the headwaters of the Vistula, he calls the Askibourgian mountains. Between these mountains and the Quadi he adds several tribes, from north to south these are the Sidones, Cotini (possibly Tacitus&#x27; Gotini) and the Visburgi. There is then the Orcynian (Hercyian) forest, which Ptolemy defines with relatively restricted boundaries, and then the Quadi.

Beyond this mountain range (probably the modern Sudetes) where the Marsigni and Buri lived, in the area of modern southwest Poland, Tacitus reported a multitude of tribes, the most widespread name of which was the Lugii. These included the Harii, Helveconae, Manimi, Helisii and Naharvali. (Tacitus does not mention the language of the Lugii.) As mentioned above, Ptolemy categorizes the Buri amongst the Lugii, and concerning the Lugii north of the mountains, he named two large groups, the Lougoi Omanoi and the Lougoi Didounoi, who live between the &quot;Suevus&quot; river (probably the Saale (Sorbian: &quot;Solawa&quot;) or Oder river) and the Vistula, south of the Burgundi.

These Burgundians who according to Ptolemy lived between the Baltic sea Germans and the Lugii, stretching between the Suevus and Vistula rivers, were described by Pliny the Elder (as opposed to Tacitus) as being not Suevic but Vandili, amongst whom he also included the Goths, and the Varini, both being people living north of them near the Baltic coast. Pliny&#x27;s &quot;Vandili&quot; are generally thought to be speakers of what modern linguists refer to as Eastern Germanic. Between the coastal Saxons and inland Suebi, Ptolemy names the Teutonari and the &quot;Viruni&quot; (presumably the Varini of Tacitus), and further east, between the coastal Farodini and the Suebi are the Teutones and then the Avarni. Further east again, between the Burgundians and the coastal Rugiclei were the &quot;Aelvaeones&quot; (presumably the Helveconae of Tacitus).

====Baltic Sea====
Tacitus called the Baltic sea the Suebian sea. Pomponius Mela wrote in his &quot;Description of the World&quot; (III.3.31) beyond the Danish isles are &quot;the farthest people of Germania, the Hermiones&quot;.

North of the Lugii, near the Baltic Sea, Tacitus places the Gothones (Goths), Rugii, and Lemovii. These three Germanic tribes share a tradition of having kings, and also similar arms – round shields and short swords. Ptolemy says that east of the Saxons, from the &quot;Chalusus&quot; river to the &quot;Suevian&quot; river are the Farodini, then the Sidini up to the &quot;Viadua&quot; river, and after these the &quot;Rugiclei&quot; up to the Vistula river (probably referring to the &quot;Rugii&quot; of Tacitus). He does not specify if these are Suevi.

In the sea, the states of the Suiones, &quot;powerful in ships&quot; are, according to Tacitus, Germans with the Suevic (Baltic) sea on one side and an &quot;almost motionless&quot; sea on the other more remote side. Modern commentators believe this refers to Scandinavia. Closely bordering on the Suiones and closely resembling them, are the tribes of the Sitones. Ptolemy describes Scandinavia as being inhabited by Chaedini in the west, Favonae and Firaesi in the east, Finni in the north, Gautae and Dauciones in the south, and Levoni in the middle. He does not describe them as Suebi.

Tacitus describes the non-Germanic Aestii on the eastern shore of the &quot;Suevic Sea&quot; (Baltic), &quot;whose rites and fashions and style of dress are those of the Suevi, while their language is more like the British.&quot; After giving this account, Tacitus says: &quot;Here Suebia ends.&quot; Therefore, for Tacitus &quot;geographic&quot; &quot;Suebia&quot; comprises the entire periphery of the Baltic Sea, including within it tribes not identified as Suebi or even Germanic. On the other hand, Tacitus does clearly consider there to be not only a Suebian region, but also Suebian languages, and Suebian customs, which all contribute to making a specific tribe more or less &quot;Suebian&quot;.

==Cultural characteristics==
Caesar noted that rather than grain crops, they spent time on animal husbandry and hunting. They wore animal skins, bathed in rivers, consumed milk and meat products, and prohibited wine, allowing trade only to dispose of their booty and otherwise they had no goods to export. They had no private ownership of land and were not permitted to stay resident in one place for more than one year. They were divided into 100 cantons, each of which had to provide and support 1000 armed men for the constant pursuit of war.

Strabo describes the Suebi and people from their part of the world as highly mobile and nomadic, unlike more settled and agricultural tribes such as the Chatti and Cherusci:...they do not till the soil or even store up food, but live in small huts that are merely temporary structures; and they live for the most part off their flocks, as the Nomads do, so that, in imitation of the Nomads, they load their household belongings on their wagons and with their beasts turn whithersoever they think best.

Notable in classical sources, the Suebi can be identified by their hair style called the &quot;Suebian knot&quot;, which &quot;distinguishes the freeman from the slave&quot;; or in other words served as a badge of social rank. The same passage points out that chiefs &quot;use an even more elaborate style&quot;.

Tacitus mentions the sacrifice of humans practiced by the Semnones in a sacred grove and the murder of slaves used in the rites of Nerthus practiced by the tribes of Schleswig-Holstein. The chief priest of the Naharvali dresses as a woman and that tribe also worships in groves. The Harii fight at night dyed black. The Suiones own fleets of rowing vessels with prows at both ends.

==Language==

While there is debate possible about whether all tribes identified by Romans as Germanic spoke a Germanic language, the Suebi are generally agreed to have spoken one or more Germanic languages. Tacitus refers to Suebian languages, implying there was more than one by the end of the first century. In particular, the Suebi are associated with the concept of an &quot;Elbe Germanic&quot; group of early dialects spoken by the Irminones, entering Germany from the east, and originating on the Baltic. In late classical times, these dialects, by now situated to the south of the Elbe, and stretching across the Danube into the Roman empire, experienced the High German consonant shift that defines modern High German languages, and in its most extreme form, Upper German.

Modern Swabian German, and Alemannic German more broadly, are therefore &quot;assumed to have evolved at least in part&quot; from Suebian. However, Bavarian, the Thuringian dialect, the Lombardic language spoken by the Lombards of Italy, and standard &quot;High German&quot; itself, are also at least partly derived from the dialects spoken by the Suebi. (The only non-Suebian name among the major groups of Upper Germanic dialects is High Franconian German, but this is on the transitional frontier with Central German, as is neighboring Thuringian.)

==Historical events==

===Ariovistus and the Suebi in 58 BC===

Julius Caesar (100 BC – 15 March 44 BC) describes the Suebi in his firsthand account, &quot;De Bello Gallico&quot;, as the &quot;largest and the most warlike nation of all the Germans&quot;.

Caesar confronted a large army led by a Suevic King named Ariovistus in 58 BC who had been settled for some time in Gaul already, at the invitation of the Gaulish Arverni and Sequani as part of their war against the Aedui. He had already been recognized as a king by the Roman senate. Ariovistus forbade the Romans from entering into Gaul. Caesar on the other hand saw himself and Rome as an ally and defender of the Aedui.

The forces Caesar faced in battle were composed of &quot;Harudes, Marcomanni, Tribocci, Vangiones, Nemetes, Sedusii, and Suevi&quot;. While Caesar was preparing for conflict, a new force of Suebi was led to the Rhine by two brothers, Nasuas and Cimberius, forcing Caesar to rush in order to try to avoid the joining of forces.

Caesar defeated Ariovistus in battle, forcing him to escape across the Rhine. When news of this spread, the fresh Suebian forces turned back in some panic, which led local tribes on the Rhine to take advantage of the situation and attack them.

===Caesar and the Suebi in 55 BC===

Also reported within Caesar&#x27;s accounts of the Gallic wars, the Suebi posed another threat in 55 BC. The Germanic Ubii, who had worked out an alliance with Caesar, were complaining of being harassed by the Suebi, and the Tencteri and Usipetes, already forced from their homes, tried to cross the Rhine and enter Gaul by force. Caesar bridged the Rhine, the first known to do so, with a pile bridge, which though considered a marvel, was dismantled after only eighteen days. The Suebi abandoned their towns closest to the Romans, retreated to the forest and assembled an army. Caesar moved back across the bridge and broke it down, stating that he had achieved his objective of warning the Suebi. They in turn supposedly stopped harassing the Ubii. The Ubii were later resettled on the west bank of the Rhine, in Roman territory.

===Rhine crossing of 29 BC===
Cassius Dio (c. 150 – 235 AD) wrote the history of Rome for a Greek audience. He reported that, shortly before 29 BC, the Suebi crossed the Rhine, only to be defeated by Gaius Carrinas who, along with the young Octavian Caesar, celebrated a triumph in 29 BC. Shortly after, they turn up fighting a group of Dacians in a gladiatorial display at Rome celebrating the consecration of the Julian hero-shrine.

===The victory of Drusus in 9 BC===
Suetonius (c. 69 AD – after 122 AD), gives the Suebi brief mention in connection with their defeat against Nero Claudius Drusus in 9 BC. He says that the Suebi and Sugambri &quot;submitted to him and were taken into Gaul and settled in lands near the Rhine&quot; while the other Germani were pushed &quot;to the farther side of the river Albis&quot; (Elbe). He must have meant the temporary military success of Drusus, as it is unlikely the Rhine was cleared of Germans. Elsewhere he identifies the settlers as 40,000 prisoners of war, only a fraction of the yearly draft of militia.

Florus (c. 74 AD – c. 130 AD), gives a more detailed view of the operations of 9 BC. He reports that the Cherusci, Suebi and Sicambri formed an alliance by crucifying twenty Roman centurions, but that Drusus defeated them, confiscated their plunder and sold them into slavery. Presumably only the war party was sold, as the Suebi continue to appear in the ancient sources.

Florus&#x27;s report of the peace brought to Germany by Drusus is glowing but premature. He built &quot;more than five hundred forts&quot; and two bridges guarded by fleets. &quot;He opened a way through the Hercynian Forest&quot;, which implies but still does not overtly state that he had subdued the Suebi. &quot;In a word, there was such peace in Germany that the inhabitants seemed changed ... and the very climate milder and softer than it used to be.&quot;

In the &quot;Annales&quot; of Tacitus, it is mentioned that after the defeat of 9 BC the Romans made peace with Maroboduus, who is described as king of the Suevians. This is the first mention of any permanent king of the Suebi. However, Maroboduus was in most sources referred to as the king of the Marcomanni, a tribal name that had already been distinct from the Suebi in Caesar&#x27;s time. (As discussed above, it is not sure which Suebi were the Suebi of Caesar, but at least they were distinguished from the Marcomanni.) However, Maroboduus was also described as Suebian, and his association with the Marcomanni more specifically comes after the Langobards and Semnones were specifically said to have left his kingdom, having previously been under his rule. At some point in this period the Marcomanni had come to be settled in the forested regions once inhabited by the Boii, in and around Bohemia, under his rule.

Augustus planned in 6 AD to destroy the kingdom of Maroboduus, which he considered to be too dangerous for the Romans. The later emperor Tiberius commanded twelve legions to attack the Marcomanni, but the outbreak of a revolt in Illyria, and the need for troops there, forced Tiberius to conclude a treaty with Maroboduus and to recognize him as king.

===Roman defeat in 9 AD===

After the death of Drusus, the Cherusci annihilated three legions at the Battle of Teutoburg Forest and thereafter &quot;... the empire ... was checked on the banks of the Rhine.&quot; While elements of the Suevi may have been involved, this was an alliance mainly made up of non-Suebic tribes from northwestern Germany, the Cherusci, Marsi, Chatti, Bructeri, Chauci, and Sicambri. The kingdom of the Marcomanni and their allies stayed out of the conflict and when Maroboduus was sent the head of the defeated Roman leader Varus, he sent it on to Rome for burial. Within his own alliance were various Suebic peoples, Hermunduri, Quadi, Semnones, Lugii, Zumi, Butones, Mugilones, Sibini and Langobards.

===Aftermath of 9 AD===

Subsequently, Augustus placed Germanicus, the son of Drusus, in charge of the forces of the Rhine and he, after dealing with a mutiny among his troops, proceeded against the Cherusci and their allies, breaking their power finally at the battle of Idistavisus, a plain on the Weser. All eight legions and supporting units of Gauls were required in order to accomplish this. Germanicus&#x27; zeal led finally to his being replaced (17 AD) by his cousin Drusus, Tiberius&#x27; son, as Tiberius thought it best to follow his predecessor&#x27;s policy of limiting the empire. Germanicus certainly would have involved the Suebi, with unpredictable results.

Arminius, leader of the Cherusci and allies, now had a free hand. He accused Maroboduus of hiding in the Hercynian Forest while the other Germans fought for freedom, and of being the only king among the Germans. The two groups &quot;turned their arms against each other.&quot; The Suebic Semnones and Langobardi rebelled against their king and went over to the Cherusci. Left with only the Marcomanni and Herminius&#x27; uncle, who had defected, Maroboduus appealed to Drusus, now governor of Illyricum, and was given only a pretext of aid.

The resulting battle was indecisive but Maroboduus withdrew to Bohemia and sent for assistance to Tiberius. He was refused on the grounds that he had not moved to help Varus. Drusus encouraged the Germans to finish him off. A force of Goths under Catualda, a Marcomannian exile, bought off the nobles and seized the palace. Maroboduus escaped to Noricum and the Romans offered him refuge in Ravenna where he remained the rest of his life. He died in 37 AD. After his expulsion the leadership of the Marcomanni was contested by their Suebic neighbours and allies, the Hermunduri and Quadi.

===Marcomannic wars===

In the 2nd century AD, the Marcomanni entered into a confederation with other peoples including the Quadi, Vandals, and Sarmatians, against the Roman Empire. The war began in 166, when the Marcomanni overwhelmed the defences between Vindobona and Carnuntum, penetrated along the border between the provinces of Pannonia and Noricum, laid waste to Flavia Solva, and could be stopped only shortly before reaching Aquileia on the Adriatic sea. The war lasted until Marcus Aurelius&#x27; death in 180.

In the third century Jordanes claims that the Marcomanni paid tribute to the Goths, and that the princes of the Quadi were enslaved. The Vandals, who had moved south towards Pannonia, were apparently still sometimes able to defend themselves.

==Migration period==
In 259/60, one or more groups of Suebi appear to have been the main element in the formation of a new tribal alliance known as the Alemanni who came to occupy the Roman frontier region known as the Agri Decumates, east of the Rhine and south of the Main. The Alamanni were sometimes simply referred to as Suebi by contemporaries, and the region came to be known as Swabia – a name which survives to this day. People in this region of Germany are still called Schwaben, a name derived from the Suebi. One specific group in the region in the 3rd century, sometimes distinguished from the Alamanni, were the Juthungi, which a monument found in Augsburg refers to as Semnones.

A large group of Suebi, whose origins are unclear, breached the Roman frontier by crossing the Rhine, perhaps at Mainz, at about the same time as the Vandals and Alans (31 December 406), thus launching an invasion of northern Gaul. It is thought that this group probably contained a significant amount of Quadi, moving out of their homeland under pressure from Radagaisus. This group later invaded Spain and became rulers of Roman Gaellicia.

Other Suebi apparently remained in or near to the original homeland areas near the Elbe and the modern Czech Republic, occasionally still being referred to by this term. Another group of Suebi, the so-called &quot;northern Suebi&quot; were described as a part of the Saxons in 569 under the Frankish king Sigebert I in areas of today&#x27;s Saxony-Anhalt. An area known as Schwabengau or Suebengau existed at least until the 12th century. 

Further south, a group of Suebi established a kingdom in parts of Pannonia, which appears in records after the Huns were defeated in 454 at the Battle of Nedao. Their king Hunimund fought against the Ostrogoths in the battle of Bolia in 469. The Suebian coalition lost the battle, and Hunimund appear to have migrated towards southern Germany. The Marcomanni probably made up one significant part of these Suebi, who lived in at least two distinct areas. Later, the Lombards, a Suebic group long known on the Elbe, came to dominate the Pannonian region before successfully invading Italy.

==Suevian Kingdom of Gallaecia==

===Migration===
Suebi under king Hermeric, probably coming from the Alemanni, the Quadi, or both, worked their way into the south of France, eventually crossing the Pyrenees and entering the Iberian Peninsula which was no longer under Imperial rule since the rebellion of Gerontius and Maximus in 409.

Passing through the Basque country, they settled in the Roman province of Gallaecia, in north-western Hispania (modern Galicia, Asturias, and the northern half of Portugal), where, swearing fealty to Emperor Honorius, they were accepted as &quot;foederati&quot; and permitted to settle under their own autonomous governance. Contemporaneously with the self-governing province of Britannia, the kingdom of the Suebi in Gallaecia became the first of the sub-Roman kingdoms to be formed in the disintegrating territory of the Western Roman Empire. Suebic Gallaecia was the first kingdom separated from the Roman Empire to mint coins.

The Suebic kingdom in Gallaecia and northern Lusitania was established in 409 and lasted until 585. Smaller than the Ostrogothic kingdom of Italy or the Visigothic kingdom in Hispania, it reached a relative stability and prosperity—and even expanded military southwards—despite the occasional quarrels with the neighbouring Visigothic kingdom.

===Settlement===

The Germanic invaders and immigrants settled mainly in rural areas, as Idacius clearly stated: &quot;The Hispanic, spread over cities and oppida...&quot; and the &quot;Barbarians, govern over the provinces&quot;. According to Dan Stanislawski, the Portuguese way of living in Northern regions is mostly inherited from the Suebi, in which small farms prevail, distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal. Bracara Augusta, the modern city of Braga and former capital of Roman Gallaecia, became the capital of the Suebi. Orosius, at that time resident in Hispania, shows a rather pacific initial settlement, the newcomers working their lands or serving as bodyguards of the locals. Another Germanic group that accompanied the Suebi and settled in Gallaecia were the Buri. They settled in the region between the rivers Cávado and Homem, in the area known as Terras de Bouro (Lands of the Buri), Portugal.

As the Suebi quickly adopted the local language, few traces were left of their Germanic tongue, but for some words and for their personal and land names, adopted by most of the Gallaeci. In Galicia four parishes and six villages are named &quot;Suevos&quot; or &quot;Suegos&quot;, i.e. &quot;Sueves&quot;, after old Suebic settlements.

===Establishment===

The Visigoths were sent in 416 by the emperor Honorius to fight the Germanic invaders in Hispania, but they were re-settled in 417 by the Romans as &quot;foederati&quot; in Aquitania after completely defeating the Alans and the Silingi Vandals. The absence of competition permitted first, the Asdingi Vandals, and later, the Suebi, to expand south and east. After the departure of the Vandals for Africa in 429 Roman authority in the peninsula was reasserted for 10 years except in northwest where the Suevi were confined. In its heyday Suebic Gallaecia extended as far south as Mérida and Seville, capitals of the Roman provinces of Lusitania and Betica, while their expeditions reached Zaragoza and Lleida after taking the Roman capital, Mérida, in 439. The previous year 438 Hermeric ratified the peace with the Gallaeci, the local and partially romanized rural population, and, weary of fighting, abdicated in favour of his son Rechila, who proved to be a notable general, defeating first Andevotus, &quot;Romanae militiae dux&quot;, and later Vitus &quot;magister utriusque militiae&quot;. In 448, Rechila died, leaving the crown to his son Rechiar who had converted to Roman Catholicism c. 447. Soon, he married a daughter of the Gothic king Theodoric I, and began a wave of attacks on the Tarraconense, still a Roman province. By 456 the campaigns of Rechiar clashed with the interests of the Visigoths, and a large army of Roman federates (Visigoths under the command of Theodoric II, Burgundians directed by kings Gundioc and Chilperic) crossed the Pyrenees into Hispania, and defeated the Suebi near modern-day Astorga. Rechiar was executed after being captured by his brother-in-law, the Visigothic king Theodoric II. In 459, the Roman emperor Majorian defeated the Suebi, briefly restoring Roman rule in northern Hispania. Nevertheless, the Suebi became free of Roman control forever after Majorian was assassinated two years later. The Suebic kingdom was confined in the northwest in Gallaecia and northern Lusitania where political division and civil war arose among several pretenders to the royal throne. After years of turmoil, Remismund was recognized as the sole king of the Suebi, bringing forth a politic of friendship with the Visigoths, and favoring the conversion of his people to Arianism.

===Last years of the kingdom===
In 561 king Ariamir called the catholic First Council of Braga, which dealt with the old problem of the Priscillianism heresy. Eight years after, in 569, king Theodemir called the First Council of Lugo, in order to increase the number of dioceses within his kingdom. Its acts have been preserved through a medieval resume known as &quot;Parrochiale Suevorum&quot; or &quot;Divisio Theodemiri&quot;.

===Defeat by the Visigoths===
In 570 the Arian king of the Visigoths, Leovigild, made his first attack on the Suebi. Between 572 and 574, Leovigild invaded the valley of the Douro, pushing the Suebi west and northwards. In 575 the Suebic king, Miro, made a peace treaty with Leovigild in what seemed to be the beginning of a new period of stability. Yet, in 583 Miro supported the rebellion of the Catholic Gothic prince Hermenegild, engaging in military action against king Leovigild, although Miro was defeated in Seville when trying to break on through the blockade on the Catholic prince. As a result, he was forced to recognize Leovigild as friend and protector, for him and for his successors, dying back home just some months later. His son, king Eboric, confirmed the friendship with Leovigild, but he was deposed just a year later by his brother-in-law Audeca, giving Leovigild an excuse to attack the kingdom. In 585 AD, first Audeca and later Malaric, were defeated and the Suebic kingdom was incorporated into the Visigothic one as its sixth province. The Suebi were respected in their properties and freedom, and continued to dwell in Gallaecia, finally merging with the rest of the local population during the early Middle Ages.

===Religion===

====Conversion to Arianism====
The Suebi remained mostly pagan, and their subjects Priscillianist until an Arian missionary named Ajax, sent by the Visigothic king Theodoric II at the request of the Suebic unifier Remismund, in 466 converted them and established a lasting Arian church which dominated the people until the conversion to Trinitarian Catholicism the 560s.

====Conversion to Orthodox Trinitarianism====
Mutually incompatible accounts of the conversion of the Suebi to Orthodox Catholic Trinitarian Christianity of the First and Second Ecumenical Councils are presented in the primary records:

* The minutes of the First Council of Braga—which met on 1 May 561—state explicitly that the synod was held at the orders of a king named Ariamir. Of the eight assistant bishops, just one bears a Suebic name: Hildemir. While the Catholicism of Ariamir is not in doubt, that he was the first Chalcedonian monarch of the Suebi since Rechiar has been contested on the grounds that his Catholicism is not explicitly stated. He was, however, the first Suebic monarch to hold a Catholic synod, and when the Second Council of Braga was held at the request of king Miro, a Catholic himself, in 572, of the twelve assistant bishops five bears Suebic names: Remisol of Viseu, Adoric of Idanha, Wittimer of Ourense, Nitigis of Lugo and Anila of Tui.
* The &quot;Historia Suevorum&quot; of Isidore of Seville states that a king named Theodemar brought about the conversion of his people from Arianism with the help of the missionary Martin of Dumio.
* According to the Frankish historian Gregory of Tours, on the other hand, an otherwise unknown sovereign named Chararic, having heard of Martin of Tours, promised to accept the beliefs of the saint if only his son would be cured of leprosy. Through the relics and intercession of Saint Martin the son was healed; Chararic and the entire royal household converted to the Nicene faith.
* By 589, when the Third Council of Toledo was held, and the Visigoth Kingdom of Toledo converted officially from Arianism to Catholicism, king Reccared I stated in its minutes that also &quot;an infinite number of Suebi have converted&quot;, together with the Goths, which implies that the earlier conversion was either superficial or partial. In the same council, four bishops from Gallaecia abjured of their Arianism. And so, the Suebic conversion is ascribed, not to a Suebe, but to a Visigoth by John of Biclarum, who puts their conversion alongside that of the Goths, occurring under Reccared I in 587–589.

Most scholars have attempted to meld these stories. It has been alleged that Chararic and Theodemir must have been successors of Ariamir, since Ariamir was the first Suebic monarch to lift the ban on Catholic synods; Isidore therefore gets the chronology wrong. Reinhart suggested that Chararic was converted first through the relics of Saint Martin and that Theodemir was converted later through the preaching of Martin of Dumio. Dahn equated Chararic with Theodemir, even saying that the latter was the name he took upon baptism. It has also been suggested that Theodemir and Ariamir were the same person and the son of Chararic. In the opinion of some historians, Chararic is nothing more than an error on the part of Gregory of Tours and never existed. If, as Gregory relates, Martin of Dumio died about the year 580 and had been bishop for about thirty years, then the conversion of Chararic must have occurred around 550 at the latest. Finally, Ferreiro believes the conversion of the Suebi was progressive and stepwise and that Chararic&#x27;s public conversion was only followed by the lifting of a ban on Catholic synods in the reign of his successor, which would have been Ariamir; Thoedemir was responsible for beginning a persecution of the Arians in his kingdom to root out their heresy.

==Norse mythology==
The name of the Suebi also appears in Norse mythology and in early Scandinavian sources. The earliest attestation is the Proto-Norse name &quot;Swabaharjaz&quot; (&quot;Suebian warrior&quot;) on the Rö runestone and in the place name Svogerslev. Sváfa, whose name means &quot;Suebian&quot;, was a Valkyrie who appears in the eddic poem &quot;Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar&quot;. The kingdom &quot;Sváfaland&quot; also appears in this poem and in the &quot;Þiðrekssaga&quot;.
