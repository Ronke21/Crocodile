<text>A ship is a large vessel that travels the world&#x27;s oceans and other navigable waterways, carrying cargo or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research and fishing. Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity and purpose. Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, and science. Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.

The word &quot;ship&quot; has meant, depending on the era and the context, either just a large vessel or specifically a ship-rigged sailing ship with three or more masts, each of which is square-rigged.

The earliest historical evidence of boats is found in Egypt during the 4th millennium BCE. In 2024, ships had a global cargo capacity of 2.4 billion tons, with the three largest classes being ships carrying dry bulk (43%), oil tankers (28%) and container ships (14%).

== Nomenclature ==
Ships are typically larger than boats, but there is no universally accepted distinction between the two. Ships generally can remain at sea for longer periods of time than boats. A legal definition of ship from Indian case law is a vessel that carries goods by sea. A common notion is that a ship can carry a boat, but not &quot;vice versa&quot;. A ship is likely to have a full-time crew assigned. A US Navy rule of thumb is that ships heel towards the &quot;outside&quot; of a sharp turn, whereas boats heel towards the &quot;inside&quot; because of the relative location of the center of mass versus the center of buoyancy. American and British 19th century maritime law distinguished &quot;vessels&quot; from other watercraft; ships and boats fall in one legal category, whereas open boats and rafts are not considered vessels.

Starting around the middle of the 18th century, sailing vessels started to be categorised by their type of rig. (Previously they were described by their hull typefor example pink, cat.) Alongside the other rig types such as schooner and brig, the term &quot;ship&quot; referred to the rig type. In this sense, a ship is a vessel with three or more masts, all of which are square-rigged. For clarity, this may be referred to as a full-rigged ship or a vessel may be described as &quot;ship-rigged&quot;. Alongside this rig-specific usage, &quot;ship&quot; continued to have the more general meaning of a large sea-going vessel. Often the meaning can only be determined by the context.

Some large vessels are traditionally called &quot;boats&quot;, notably submarines. Others include Great Lakes freighters, riverboats, and ferryboats, which may be designed for operation on inland or protected coastal waters.

In most maritime traditions ships have individual names, and modern ships may belong to a ship class often named after its first ship.

In many documents the ship name is introduced with a ship prefix being an abbreviation of the ship class, for example &quot;MS&quot; (motor ship) or &quot;SV&quot; (sailing vessel), making it easier to distinguish a ship name from other individual names in a text.

&quot;Ship&quot; (along with &quot;nation&quot;) is an English word that has retained a female grammatical gender in some usages, which allows it sometimes to be referred to as a &quot;she&quot; without being of female natural gender.

==History==

For most of history, transport by shipprovided there is a feasible route has generally been cheaper, safer and faster than making the same journey on land. Only the coming of railways in the middle of the 19th century and the growth of commercial aviation in the second half of the 20th century have changed this principle. This applied equally to sea crossings, coastal voyages and use of rivers and lakes.

Examples of the consequences of this include the large grain trade in the Mediterranean during the classical period. Cities such as Rome were totally reliant on the delivery by sailing and human powered (oars) ships of the large amounts of grain needed. It has been estimated that it cost less for a sailing ship of the Roman Empire to carry grain the length of the Mediterranean than to move the same amount 15 miles by road. Rome consumed about 150,000 tons of Egyptian grain each year over the first three centuries AD.

Until recently, it was generally the case that ships were the most advanced representations of the technology available to the societies that produced them.

===Prehistory and antiquity===
==== Asian developments ====
The earliest attestations of ships in maritime transport in Mesopotamia are model ships, which date back to the 4th millennium BC. In archaic texts in Uruk, Sumer, the ideogram for &quot;ship&quot; is attested, but in the inscriptions of the kings of Lagash, ships were first mentioned in connection to maritime trade and naval warfare at around 2500–2350 BCE.

Austronesian peoples originated in what is now Taiwan. From here, they took part in the Austronesian Expansion. Their distinctive maritime technology was integral to this movement and included catamarans and outriggers. It has been suggested that they had sails some time before 2000 BCE. Their crab claw sails enabled them to sail for vast distances in open ocean. From Taiwan, they rapidly colonized the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia, then sailed further onwards to Micronesia, Island Melanesia, Polynesia, and Madagascar, eventually colonizing a territory spanning half the globe.

Austronesian sails were made from woven leaves, usually from pandan plants. These were complemented by paddlers, who usually positioned themselves on platforms on the outriggers in the larger boats. Austronesian ships ranged in complexity from simple dugout canoes with outriggers or lashed together to large edge-pegged plank-built boats built around a keel made from a dugout canoe. Their designs were unique, evolving from ancient rafts to the characteristic double-hulled, single-outrigger, and double-outrigger designs of Austronesian ships.

In the 2nd century AD, people from the Indonesian archipelago already made large ships measuring over 50 m long and standing 4–7 m out of the water. They could carry 600–1000 people and 250–1000 ton cargo. These ships were known as &quot;kunlun bo&quot; or &quot;k&#x27;unlun po&quot; (崑崙舶, lit. &quot;ship of the Kunlun people&quot;) by the Chinese, and &quot;kolandiaphonta&quot; by the Greeks. They had 4–7 masts and were able to sail against the wind due to the usage of tanja sails. These ships may have reached as far as Ghana. In the 11th century, a new type of ship called djong or jong was recorded in Java and Bali. This type of ship was built using wooden dowels and treenails, unlike the &quot;kunlun bo&quot; which used vegetal fibres for lashings.

In China, miniature models of ships that feature steering oars have been dated to the Warring States period (c. 475–221 BC). By the Han dynasty, a well kept naval fleet was an integral part of the military. Centre-line rudders, mounted at the stern, started to appear on Chinese ship models starting in the 1st century AD. However, these early Chinese ships were fluvial (riverine), and were not seaworthy. The Chinese only acquired sea-going ship technologies in the 10th-century AD Song dynasty after contact with Southeast Asian &quot;k&#x27;un-lun po&quot; trading ships, leading to the development of the junks.

==== Mediterranean developments ====

The earliest historical evidence of boats is found in Egypt during the 4th millennium BCE The Greek historian and geographer Agatharchides had documented ship-faring among the early Egyptians: &quot;During the prosperous period of the Old Kingdom, between the 30th and 25th centuries BC, the river-routes were kept in order, and Egyptian ships sailed the Red Sea as far as the myrrh-country.&quot; Sneferu&#x27;s ancient cedar wood ship Praise of the Two Lands is the first reference recorded (2613 BC) to a ship being referred to by name.

The ancient Egyptians were perfectly at ease building sailboats. A remarkable example of their shipbuilding skills was the Khufu ship, a vessel in length entombed at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza around 2500 BC and found intact in 1954.

The oldest discovered sea faring hulled boat is the Late Bronze Age Uluburun shipwreck off the coast of Turkey, dating back to 1300 BC.

By 1200 B.C., the Phoenicians were building large merchant ships. In world maritime history, declares Richard Woodman, they are recognized as &quot;the first true seafarers, founding the art of pilotage, cabotage, and navigation&quot; and the architects of &quot;the first true ship, built of planks, capable of carrying a deadweight cargo and being sailed and steered.&quot;

===14th through the 18th centuries===
==== Asian developments ====

At this time, ships were developing in Asia in much the same way as Europe. Japan used defensive naval techniques in the Mongol invasions of Japan in 1281. It is likely that the Mongols of the time took advantage of both European and Asian shipbuilding techniques. During the 15th century, China&#x27;s Ming dynasty assembled one of the largest and most powerful naval fleets in the world for the diplomatic and power projection voyages of Zheng He. Elsewhere in Japan in the 15th century, one of the world&#x27;s first iron-clads, &quot;Tekkōsen&quot; (鉄甲船), literally meaning &quot;iron ships&quot;, was also developed. In Japan, during the Sengoku era from the 15th century to 17th century, the great struggle for feudal supremacy was fought, in part, by coastal fleets of several hundred boats, including the atakebune. In Korea, in the early 15th century during the Joseon era, &quot;Geobukseon&quot;(거북선), was developed.

The empire of Majapahit used large ships called jong, built in northern Java, for transporting troops overseas. The jongs were transport ships which could carry 100–2000 tons of cargo and 50–1000 people, 28.99–88.56 meter in length. The exact number of jong fielded by Majapahit is unknown, but the largest number of jong deployed in an expedition is about 400 jongs, when Majapahit attacked Pasai, in 1350.

==== Europe ====
Until the late 13th or early 14th century, European shipbuilding had two separate traditions. In Northern Europe clinker construction predominated. In this, the hull planks are fastened together in an overlapping manner. This is a &quot;shell first&quot; construction technique, with the hull shape being defined by the shaping and fitting of the hull planks. The reinforcing s (or ribs) are fitted after the planks. Clinker construction in this era usually used planks that were cleft (split radially from the log) and could be made thinner and stronger per unit of thickness than the sawn logs, thanks to preserving the radial integrity of the grain. 

An exception to clinker construction in the Northern European tradition is the bottom planking of the cog. Here, the hull planks are not joined to each other and are laid flush (not overlapped). They are held together by fastening to the frames but this is done after the shaping and fitting of these planks. Therefore, this is another case of a &quot;shell first&quot; construction technique.

These Northern European ships were rigged with a single mast setting a square sail. They were steered by rudders hung on the . 

In contrast, the ship-building tradition of the Mediterranean was of carvel constructionthe fitting of the hull planking to the frames of the hull. Depending on the precise detail of this method, it may be characterised as either &quot;frame first&quot; or &quot;frame-led&quot;. In either variant, during construction, the hull shape is determined by the frames, not the planking. The hull planks are not fastened to each other, only to the frames.

These Mediterranean ships were rigged with lateen sails on one or more masts (depending on the size of the vessel) and were steered with a side rudder. They are often referred to as &quot;round ships&quot;.

Crucially, the Mediterranean and Northern European traditions merged. Cogs are known to have travelled to the Mediterranean in the 12th and 13th centuries. Some aspects of their designs were being copied by Mediterranean ship-builders early in the 14th century. Iconography shows square sails being used on the mainmast but a lateen on the mizzen, and a sternpost hung rudder replacing the side rudder. The name for this type of vessel was &quot;coche&quot; or, for a larger example, &quot;carrack&quot;. Some of these new Mediterranean types travelled to Northern European waters and, in the first two decades of the 15th century, a few were captured by the English, two of which had previously been under charter to the French. The two-masted rig started to be copied immediately, but at this stage on a clinker hull. The adoption of carvel hulls had to wait until sufficient shipwrights with appropriate skills could be hired, but by late in the 1430s, there were instances of carvel ships being built in Northern Europe, and in increasing numbers over the rest of the century.

This hybridisation of Mediterranean and Northern European ship types created the full-rigged ship, a three-masted vessel with a square-rigged foremast and mainmast and a lateen sail on the mizzen. This provided most of the ships used in the Age of Discovery, being able to carry sufficient stores for a long voyage and with a rig suited to the open ocean. Over the next four hundred years, steady evolution and development, from the starting point of the carrack, gave types such as the galleon, fluit, East Indiaman, ordinary cargo ships, warships, clippers and many more, all based on this three-masted square-rigged type.

The transition from clinker to carvel construction facilitated the use of artillery at sea since the internal framing of the hull could be made strong enough to accommodate the weight of guns. It was easier to fit gunports in a carvel hull. As vessels became larger and the demand for ship-building timber affected the size of trees available, clinker construction became limited by the difficulty of finding large enough logs from which to cleave planks. Nonetheless, some clinker vessels approached the size of contemporary carracks. Before the adoption of carvel construction, the increasing size of clinker-built vessels necessitated greater amounts of internal framing of their hulls for strengthsomething that somewhat lessened the conceptual change to the new technique.

===19th and 20th centuries: specialization and modernization===

Parallel to the development of warships, ships in service of marine fishery and trade also developed in the period between antiquity and the Renaissance.

Maritime trade was driven by the development of shipping companies with significant financial resources. Canal barges, towed by draft animals on an adjacent towpath, contended with the railway up to and past the early days of the Industrial Revolution. Flat-bottomed and flexible scow boats also became widely used for transporting small cargoes. Mercantile trade went hand-in-hand with exploration, self-financed by the commercial benefits of exploration.

During the first half of the 18th century, the French Navy began to develop a new type of vessel known as a ship of the line, featuring seventy-four guns. This type of ship became the backbone of all European fighting fleets. These ships were long and their construction required 2,800 oak trees and of rope; they carried a crew of about 800 sailors and soldiers. During the 19th century the Royal Navy enforced a ban on the slave trade, acted to suppress piracy, and continued to map the world. Ships and their owners grew with the 19th century Industrial Revolution across Europe and North America, leading to increased numbers of oceangoing ships, as well as other coastal and canal based vessels.

Through more than half of the 19th century and into the early years of the 20th century, steam ships coexisted with sailing vessels. Initially, steam was only viable on shorter routes, typically transporting passengers who could afford higher fares and mail. Steam went through many developmental steps that gave greater fuel efficiency, thereby increasingly making steamships commercially competitive with sail. Screw propulsion, which relied, among other things, on the invention of an effective stern gland for the propeller shaft, worked better than paddle wheels. Higher boiler pressures of powering compound engines, were introduced in 1865, making long-distance steam cargo vessels commercially viable on the route from England to Chinaeven before the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. Within a few years, steam had replaced many of the sailing ships that had served this route. Even greater fuel efficiency was obtained with triple-expansion steam enginesbut this had to wait for higher quality steel to be available to make boilers running at in SS Aberdeen (1881). By this point virtually all routes could be served competitively by steamships. Sail continued with some cargoes, where low costs were more important to the shipper than a predictable and rapid journey time.

The Second Industrial Revolution in particular led to new mechanical methods of propulsion, and the ability to construct ships from metal triggered an explosion in ship design. These led to the development of long-distance commercial ships and Ocean liners, as well as technological changes including the Marine steam engine, screw propellers, triple expansion engines and others. Factors included the quest for more efficient ships, the end of long running and wasteful maritime conflicts, and the increased financial capacity of industrial powers created more specialized ships and other maritime vessels. Ship types built for entirely new functions that appeared by the 20th century included research ships, offshore support vessels (OSVs), Floating production storage and offloading (FPSOs), Pipe and cable laying ships, drill ships and Survey vessels.

The late 20th century saw changes to ships that included the decline of ocean liners as air travel increased. The rise of container ships from the 1960s onwards dramatically changed the nature of commercial merchant shipping, as containerization led to larger ship sizes, dedicated container routes and the decline of general cargo vessels as well as tramp steaming. The late 20th century also saw a rise in cruise ships for tourism around the world.

===21st century===

In 2016, there were more than 49,000 merchant ships, totaling almost 1.8 billion deadweight tons. Of these 28% were oil tankers, 43% were bulk carriers, and 13% were container ships. By 2019, the world&#x27;s fleet included 51,684 commercial vessels with gross tonnage of more than 1,000 tons, totaling 1.96 billion tons. Such ships carried 11 billion tons of cargo in 2018, a sum that grew by 2.7% over the previous year. In terms of tonnage, 29% of ships were tankers, 43% are bulk carriers, 13% container ships and 15% were other types.

In 2008, there were 1,240 warships operating in the world, not counting small vessels such as patrol boats. The United States accounted for 3 million tons worth of these vessels, Russia 1.35 million tons, the United Kingdom 504,660 tons and China 402,830 tons. The 20th century saw many naval engagements during the two world wars, the Cold War, and the rise to power of naval forces of the two blocs. The world&#x27;s major powers have recently used their naval power in cases such as the United Kingdom in the Falkland Islands and the United States in Iraq.

The size of the world&#x27;s fishing fleet is more difficult to estimate. The largest of these are counted as commercial vessels, but the smallest are legion. Fishing vessels can be found in most seaside villages in the world. As of 2004, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimated 4 million fishing vessels were operating worldwide. The same study estimated that the world&#x27;s 29 million fishermen caught of fish and shellfish that year.

In 2023, the number of ships globally grew by 3.4%. In 2024, new ships are increasingly being built with alternative fuel capability to increase sustainability and reduce carbon emissions. Alternative ship fuels include LNG, LPG, methanol, biofuel, ammonia and hydrogen among others.

As of 2024, wind power for ships had received renewed interest for its potential to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.

==Types of ships==
Because ships are constructed using the principles of naval architecture that require same structural components, their classification is based on their function such as that suggested by Paulet and Presles, which requires modification of the components. The categories accepted in general by naval architects are:
* High-speed craft – Multihulls including wave piercers, small-waterplane-area twin hull (SWATH), surface effect ships and hovercraft, hydrofoil, wing in ground effect craft (WIG).
* Off shore oil vessels – Platform supply vessels, pipe layers, accommodation and crane barges, non and semi-submersible drilling rigs, drill ships, production platforms, floating production storage and offloading units.
* Fishing vessels
** Motorised fishing trawlers, trap setters, seiners, longliners, trollers &amp; factory ships.
** Traditional sailing and rowed fishing vessels and boats used for handline fishing
* Harbour work craft
** Cable layers
** Tugboats, dredgers, salvage vessels, tenders, pilot boats.
** Floating dry docks, crane vessels, lighterships.
* Dry cargo ships – tramp freighters, bulk carriers, cargo liners, container vessels, barge carriers, Ro-Ro ships, refrigerated cargo ships, timber carriers, livestock carriers &amp; light vehicle carriers.
* Liquid cargo ships – tankers, oil tankers, liquefied gas carriers, LNG carriers, chemical carriers.
* Passenger ships
** Liners, cruise and special trade passenger (STP) ships
** Cross-channel, coastal and harbour ferries
** Luxury and cruising yachts and superyachts
* Sail training and sailing ships
* Galleys – biremes, triremes and quinquiremes
* Recreational boats and craft – rowed, masted and motorised craft
* Special-purpose vessels – weather and research vessels, deep sea survey vessels, and icebreakers.
* Submarines – watercraft capable of independent operation underwater.
* Naval ships
** Warships – aircraft carriers, amphibious warfare ships, battleships, battlecruisers, coastal defence ships, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, patrol ships, minesweepers, etc.
** Auxiliary ships – ammunition ships, replenishment oilers, repair ships, storeships, troopships, etc.
* Hospital ships
Some of these are discussed in the following sections.

===Inland vessels===
Freshwater shipping may occur on lakes, rivers and canals. Ships designed for those body of waters may be specially adapted to the widths and depths of specific waterways. Examples of freshwater waterways that are navigable in part by large vessels include the Danube, Mississippi, Rhine, Yangtze and Amazon Rivers, and the Great Lakes.

====Great Lakes====
Lake freighters, also called lakers, are cargo vessels that ply the Great Lakes. The most well-known is , the latest major vessel to be wrecked on the Lakes. These vessels are traditionally called boats, not ships. Visiting ocean-going vessels are called &quot;salties&quot;. Because of their additional beam, very large salties are never seen inland of the Saint Lawrence Seaway. Because the smallest of the Soo Locks is larger than any Seaway lock, salties that can pass through the Seaway may travel anywhere in the Great Lakes. Because of their deeper draft, salties may accept partial loads on the Great Lakes, &quot;topping off&quot; when they have exited the Seaway. Similarly, the largest lakers are confined to the Upper Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie) because they are too large to use the Seaway locks, beginning at the Welland Canal that bypasses the Niagara River.

Since the freshwater lakes are less corrosive to ships than the salt water of the oceans, lakers tend to last much longer than ocean freighters. Lakers older than 50 years are not unusual, and as of 2005, all were over 20 years of age.

, built in 1906 as &quot;William P Snyder&quot;, was the oldest laker still working on the Lakes until its conversion into a barge starting in 2013. Similarly, &quot;E.M. Ford&quot;, built in 1898 as &quot;Presque Isle&quot;, was sailing the lakes 98 years later in 1996. As of 2007 &quot;E.M. Ford&quot; was still afloat as a stationary transfer vessel at a riverside cement silo in Saginaw, Michigan.

=== Merchant ship ===


Merchant ships are ships used for commercial purposes and can be divided into four broad categories: fishing vessels, cargo ships, passenger ships, and special-purpose ships. The UNCTAD review of maritime transport categorizes ships as: oil tankers, bulk (and combination) carriers, general cargo ships, container ships, and &quot;other ships&quot;, which includes &quot;liquefied petroleum gas carriers, liquefied natural gas carriers, parcel (chemical) tankers, specialized tankers, reefers, offshore supply, tugs, dredgers, cruise, ferries, other non-cargo&quot;. General cargo ships include &quot;multi-purpose and project vessels and roll-on/roll-off cargo&quot;.

Modern commercial vessels are typically powered by a single propeller driven by a diesel or, less usually, gas turbine engine., but until the mid-19th century they were predominantly square sail rigged. The fastest vessels may use pump-jet engines. Most commercial vessels such as container ships, have full hull-forms (higher Block coefficients) to maximize cargo capacity. Merchant ships and fishing vessels are usually made of steel, although aluminum can be used on faster craft, and fiberglass or wood on smaller vessels. Commercial vessels generally have a crew headed by a sea captain, with deck officers and engine officers on larger vessels. Special-purpose vessels often have specialized crew if necessary, for example scientists aboard research vessels.

Fishing boats are generally small, often little more than but up to for a large tuna or whaling ship. Aboard a fish processing vessel, the catch can be made ready for market and sold more quickly once the ship makes port. Special purpose vessels have special gear. For example, trawlers have winches and arms, stern-trawlers have a rear ramp, and tuna seiners have skiffs. In 2004, of fish were caught in the marine capture fishery. Anchoveta represented the largest single catch at . That year, the top ten marine capture species also included Alaska pollock, Blue whiting, Skipjack tuna, Atlantic herring, Chub mackerel, Japanese anchovy, Chilean jack mackerel, Largehead hairtail, and Yellowfin tuna. Other species including salmon, shrimp, lobster, clams, squid and crab, are also commercially fished. Modern commercial fishermen use many methods. One is fishing by nets, such as purse seine, beach seine, lift nets, gillnets, or entangling nets. Another is trawling, including bottom trawl. Hooks and lines are used in methods like long-line fishing and hand-line fishing. Another method is the use of fishing trap.

Cargo ships transport dry and liquid cargo. Dry cargo can be transported in bulk by bulk carriers, packed directly onto a general cargo ship in break-bulk, packed in intermodal containers as aboard a container ship, or driven aboard as in roll-on roll-off ships. Liquid cargo is generally carried in bulk aboard tankers, such as oil tankers which may include both crude and finished products of oil, chemical tankers which may also carry vegetable oils other than chemicals and gas carriers, although smaller shipments may be carried on container ships in tank containers.

Passenger ships range in size from small river ferries to very large cruise ships. This type of vessel includes ferries, which move passengers and vehicles on short trips; ocean liners, which carry passengers from one place to another; and cruise ships, which carry passengers on voyages undertaken for pleasure, visiting several places and with leisure activities on board, often returning them to the port of embarkation. Riverboats and inland ferries are specially designed to carry passengers, cargo, or both in the challenging river environment. Rivers present special hazards to vessels. They usually have varying water flows that alternately lead to high speed water flows or protruding rock hazards. Changing siltation patterns may cause the sudden appearance of shoal waters, and often floating or sunken logs and trees (called snags) can endanger the hulls and propulsion of riverboats. Riverboats are generally of shallow draft, being broad of beam and rather square in plan, with a low freeboard and high topsides. Riverboats can survive with this type of configuration as they do not have to withstand the high winds or large waves that are seen on large lakes, seas, or oceans.

Fishing vessels are a subset of commercial vessels, but generally small in size and often subject to different regulations and classification. They can be categorized by several criteria: architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, geographical origin, and technical features such as rigging. As of 2004, the world&#x27;s fishing fleet consisted of some 4 million vessels. Of these, 1.3 million were decked vessels with enclosed areas and the rest were open vessels. Most decked vessels were mechanized, but two-thirds of the open vessels were traditional craft propelled by sails and oars. More than 60% of all existing large fishing vessels were built in Japan, Peru, the Russian Federation, Spain or the United States of America.

===Special purpose vessels===
A weather ship was a ship stationed in the ocean as a platform for surface and upper air meteorological observations for use in marine weather forecasting. Surface weather observations were taken hourly, and four radiosonde releases occurred daily. It was also meant to aid in search and rescue operations and to support transatlantic flights. Proposed as early as 1927 by the aviation community, the establishment of weather ships proved to be so useful during World War II that the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) established a global network of weather ships in 1948, with 13 to be supplied by the United States. This number was eventually negotiated down to nine.

The weather ship crews were normally at sea for three weeks at a time, returning to port for 10-day stretches. Weather ship observations proved to be helpful in wind and wave studies, as they did not avoid weather systems like other ships tended to for safety reasons. They were also helpful in monitoring storms at sea, such as tropical cyclones. The removal of a weather ship became a negative factor in forecasts leading up to the Great Storm of 1987. Beginning in the 1970s, their role became largely superseded by weather buoys due to the ships&#x27; significant cost. The agreement of the use of weather ships by the international community ended in 1990. The last weather ship was &quot;Polarfront&quot;, known as weather station M (&quot;Mike&quot;), which was put out of operation on 1 January 2010. Weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation.

===Naval vessels===

Naval ships are diverse in types of vessel. They include: surface warships, submarines, and auxiliary ships.

Modern warships are generally divided into seven main categories: aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, frigates, corvettes, submarines and amphibious warfare ships. The distinctions among cruisers, destroyers, frigates, and corvettes are not codified; the same vessel may be described differently in different navies. Battleships were used during the Second World War and occasionally since then (the last battleships were removed from the U.S. Naval Vessel Register in March 2006), but were made obsolete by the use of carrier-borne aircraft and guided missiles.

Most military submarines are either attack submarines or ballistic missile submarines. Until the end of World War II the primary role of the diesel/electric submarine was anti-ship warfare, inserting and removing covert agents and military forces, and intelligence-gathering. With the development of the homing torpedo, better sonar systems, and nuclear propulsion, submarines also became able to effectively hunt each other. The development of submarine-launched nuclear and cruise missiles gave submarines a substantial and long-ranged ability to attack both land and sea targets with a variety of weapons ranging from cluster munitions to nuclear weapons.

Most navies also include many types of support and auxiliary vessel, such as minesweepers, patrol boats, offshore patrol vessels, replenishment ships, and hospital ships which are designated medical treatment facilities.

Fast combat vessels such as cruisers and destroyers usually have fine hulls to maximize speed and maneuverability. They also usually have advanced marine electronics and communication systems, as well as weapons.

==Architecture==

Some components exist in vessels of any size and purpose. Every vessel has a hull of sorts. Every vessel has some sort of propulsion, whether it&#x27;s a pole, an ox, or a nuclear reactor. Most vessels have some sort of steering system. Other characteristics are common, but not as universal, such as compartments, holds, a superstructure, and equipment such as anchors and winches.

===Hull===
For a ship to float, its weight must be less than that of the water displaced by the ship&#x27;s hull. There are many types of hulls, from logs lashed together to form a raft to the advanced hulls of America&#x27;s Cup sailboats. A vessel may have a single hull (called a monohull design), two in the case of catamarans, or three in the case of trimarans. Vessels with more than three hulls are rare, but some experiments have been conducted with designs such as pentamarans. Multiple hulls are generally parallel to each other and connected by rigid arms.

Hulls have several elements. The bow is the foremost part of the hull. Many ships feature a bulbous bow. The keel is at the very bottom of the hull, extending the entire length of the ship. The rear part of the hull is known as the stern, and many hulls have a flat back known as a transom. Common hull appendages include propellers for propulsion, rudders for steering, and stabilizers to quell a ship&#x27;s rolling motion. Other hull features can be related to the vessel&#x27;s work, such as fishing gear and sonar domes.

Hulls are subject to various hydrostatic and hydrodynamic constraints. The key hydrostatic constraint is that it must be able to support the entire weight of the boat, and maintain stability even with often unevenly distributed weight. Hydrodynamic constraints include the ability to withstand shock waves, weather collisions and groundings.

Older ships and pleasure craft often have or had wooden hulls. Steel is used for most commercial vessels. Aluminium is frequently used for fast vessels, and composite materials are often found in sailboats and pleasure craft. Some ships have been made with concrete hulls.

===Propulsion systems===
Propulsion systems for ships fall into three categories: human propulsion, sailing, and mechanical propulsion. Human propulsion includes rowing, which was used even on large galleys. Propulsion by sail generally consists of a sail hoisted on an erect mast, supported by stays and spars and controlled by ropes. Sail systems were the dominant form of propulsion until the 19th century. They are now generally used for recreation and competition, although experimental sail systems, such as the turbosails, rotorsails, and wingsails have been used on larger modern vessels for fuel savings.

Mechanical propulsion systems generally consist of a motor or engine turning a propeller, or less frequently, an impeller or wave propulsion fins. Steam engines were first used for this purpose, but have mostly been replaced by two-stroke or four-stroke diesel engines, outboard motors, and gas turbine engines on faster ships. Nuclear reactors producing steam are used to propel warships and icebreakers, and there have been attempts to use them to power commercial vessels (see NS &quot;Savannah&quot;).

In addition to traditional fixed and controllable pitch propellers there are many specialized variations, such as contra-rotating and nozzle-style propellers. Most vessels have a single propeller, but some large vessels may have up to four propellers supplemented with transverse thrusters for maneuvring at ports. The propeller is connected to the main engine via a propeller shaft and, in case of medium- and high-speed engines, a reduction gearbox. Some modern vessels have a diesel–electric powertrain in which the propeller is turned by an electric motor powered by the ship&#x27;s generators.

As environmental sustainability becomes a paramount concern, the maritime industry is exploring cleaner propulsion technologies. Alternatives like LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas), ammonia, and hydrogen are emerging as viable options. LPG is already utilized as fuel for long-distance shipping, offering a cleaner option with a lower carbon footprint. Meanwhile, hydrogen and ammonia technologies are in development stages for long-haul applications, promising even more significant reductions in emissions and a step closer to achieving carbon-neutral shipping.

=== Steering systems ===
For ships with independent propulsion systems for each side, such as manual oars or some paddles, steering systems may not be necessary. In most designs, such as boats propelled by engines or sails, a steering system becomes necessary. The most common is a rudder, a submerged plane located at the rear of the hull. Rudders are rotated to generate a lateral force which turns the boat. Rudders can be rotated by a tiller, manual wheels, or electro-hydraulic systems. Autopilot systems combine mechanical rudders with navigation systems. Ducted propellers are sometimes used for steering.

Some propulsion systems are inherently steering systems. Examples include the outboard motor, the bow thruster, and the azimuth thruster.

===Holds, compartments, and the superstructure===
Larger boats and ships generally have multiple decks and compartments. Separate berthings and heads are found on sailboats over about . Fishing boats and cargo ships typically have one or more cargo holds. Most larger vessels have an engine room, a galley, and various compartments for work. Tanks are used to store fuel, engine oil, and fresh water. Ballast tanks are equipped to change a ship&#x27;s trim and modify its stability.

Superstructures are found above the main deck. On sailboats, these are usually very low. On modern cargo ships, they are almost always located near the ship&#x27;s stern. On passenger ships and warships, the superstructure generally extends far forward.

===Equipment===
Shipboard equipment varies from ship to ship depending on such factors as the ship&#x27;s era, design, area of operation, and purpose. Some types of equipment that are widely found include:
* Masts can be the home of antennas, navigation lights, radar transponders, fog signals, and similar devices often required by law.
* Ground tackle comprises the anchor, its chain or cable, and connecting fittings.
* Cargo equipment such as cranes and cargo booms may be used to load and unload cargo and ship&#x27;s stores.
* Safety equipment such as lifeboats, liferafts, and survival suits are carried aboard many vessels for emergency use.

==Design considerations==
===Hydrostatics===

Ships float in the water at a level where mass of the displaced water equals the mass of the vessel, so that the downwards force of gravity equals the upward force of buoyancy. As a vessel is lowered into the water its weight remains constant but the corresponding weight of water displaced by its hull increases. If the vessel&#x27;s mass is evenly distributed throughout, it floats evenly along its length and across its beam (width). A vessel&#x27;s stability is considered in both this hydrostatic sense as well as a hydrodynamic sense, when subjected to movement, rolling and pitching, and the action of waves and wind. Stability problems can lead to excessive pitching and rolling, and eventually capsizing and sinking.

===Hydrodynamics===

The advance of a vessel through water is resisted by the water. This resistance can be broken down into several components, the main ones being the friction of the water on the hull and wave making resistance. To reduce resistance and therefore increase the speed for a given power, it is necessary to reduce the wetted surface and use submerged hull shapes that produce low amplitude waves. To do so, high-speed vessels are often more slender, with fewer or smaller appendages. The friction of the water is also reduced by regular maintenance of the hull to remove the sea creatures and algae that accumulate there. Antifouling paint is commonly used to assist in this. Advanced designs such as the bulbous bow assist in decreasing wave resistance.

A simple way of considering wave-making resistance is to look at the hull in relation to its wake. At speeds lower than the wave propagation speed, the wave rapidly dissipates to the sides. As the hull approaches the wave propagation speed, however, the wake at the bow begins to build up faster than it can dissipate, and so it grows in amplitude. Since the water is not able to &quot;get out of the way of the hull fast enough&quot;, the hull, in essence, has to climb over or push through the bow wave. This results in an exponential increase in resistance with increasing speed.

This hull speed is found by the formula:

&lt;/math&gt;}}

or, in metric units:

&lt;/math&gt;}}

where &quot;L&quot; is the length of the waterline in feet or meters.

When the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 0.94, it starts to outrun most of its bow wave, and the hull actually settles slightly in the water as it is now only supported by two wave peaks. As the vessel exceeds a speed/length ratio of 1.34, the hull speed, the wavelength is now longer than the hull, and the stern is no longer supported by the wake, causing the stern to squat, and the bow rise. The hull is now starting to climb its own bow wave, and resistance begins to increase at a very high rate. While it is possible to drive a displacement hull faster than a speed/length ratio of 1.34, it is prohibitively expensive to do so. Most large vessels operate at speed/length ratios well below that level, at speed/length ratios of under 1.0.

For large projects with adequate funding, hydrodynamic resistance can be tested experimentally in a hull testing pool or using tools of computational fluid dynamics.

Vessels are also subject to ocean surface waves and sea swell as well as effects of wind and weather. These movements can be stressful for passengers and equipment, and must be controlled if possible. The rolling movement can be controlled, to an extent, by ballasting or by devices such as fin stabilizers. Pitching movement is more difficult to limit and can be dangerous if the bow submerges in the waves, a phenomenon called pounding. Sometimes, ships must change course or speed to stop violent rolling or pitching.

==Lifecycle==
A ship will pass through several stages during its career. The first is usually an initial contract to build the ship, the details of which can vary widely based on relationships between the shipowners, operators, designers and the shipyard. Then, the design phase carried out by a naval architect. Then the ship is constructed in a shipyard. After construction, the vessel is launched and goes into service. Ships end their careers in a number of ways, ranging from shipwrecks to service as a museum ship to the scrapyard.

===Design===

A vessel&#x27;s design starts with a specification, which a naval architect uses to create a project outline, assess required dimensions, and create a basic layout of spaces and a rough displacement. After this initial rough draft, the architect can create an initial hull design, a general profile and an initial overview of the ship&#x27;s propulsion. At this stage, the designer can iterate on the ship&#x27;s design, adding detail and refining the design at each stage.

The designer will typically produce an overall plan, a general specification describing the peculiarities of the vessel, and construction blueprints to be used at the building site. Designs for larger or more complex vessels may also include sail plans, electrical schematics, and plumbing and ventilation plans.

As environmental laws are becoming more strict, ship designers need to create their design in such a way that the ship, when it nears its end-of-term, can be disassembled or disposed easily and that waste is reduced to a minimum.

===Construction===
Ship construction takes place in a shipyard, and can last from a few months for a unit produced in series, to several years to reconstruct a wooden boat like the frigate &quot;Hermione&quot;, to more than 10 years for an aircraft carrier. During World War II, the need for cargo ships was so urgent that construction time for Liberty Ships went from initially eight months or longer, down to weeks or even days. Builders employed production line and prefabrication techniques such as those used in shipyards today.

Hull materials and vessel size play a large part in determining the method of construction. The hull of a mass-produced fiberglass sailboat is constructed from a mold, while the steel hull of a cargo ship is made from large sections welded together as they are built.

Generally, construction starts with the hull, and on vessels over about , by the laying of the keel. This is done in a drydock or on land. Once the hull is assembled and painted, it is launched. The last stages, such as raising the superstructure and adding equipment and accommodation, can be done after the vessel is afloat.

Once completed, the vessel is delivered to the customer. Ship launching is often a ceremony of some significance, and is usually when the vessel is formally named. A typical small rowboat can cost under US$100, $1,000 for a small speedboat, tens of thousands of dollars for a cruising sailboat, and about $2,000,000 for a Vendée Globe class sailboat. A trawler may cost $2.5 million, and a 1,000-person-capacity high-speed passenger ferry can cost in the neighborhood of $50 million. A ship&#x27;s cost partly depends on its complexity: a small, general cargo ship will cost $20 million, a Panamax-sized bulk carrier around $35 million, a supertanker around $105 million and a large LNG carrier nearly $200 million. The most expensive ships generally are so because of the cost of embedded electronics: a costs around $2 billion, and an aircraft carrier goes for about $3.5 billion.

In 2023, the majority of the world&#x27;s ships (95% of global output) were built in just three countries: China, South Korea and Japan.

===Repair and conversion===

Ships undergo nearly constant maintenance during their career, whether they be underway, pierside, or in some cases, in periods of reduced operating status between charters or shipping seasons.

Most ships, however, require trips to special facilities such as a drydock at regular intervals. Tasks often done at drydock include removing biological growths on the hull, sandblasting and repainting the hull, and replacing sacrificial anodes used to protect submerged equipment from corrosion. Major repairs to the propulsion and steering systems as well as major electrical systems are also often performed at dry dock.

Some vessels that sustain major damage at sea may be repaired at a facility equipped for major repairs, such as a shipyard. Ships may also be converted for a new purpose: oil tankers are often converted into floating production storage and offloading units.

===End of service===

Most ocean-going cargo ships have a life expectancy of between 20 and 30 years. A sailboat made of plywood or fiberglass can last between 30 and 40 years. Solid wooden ships can last much longer but require regular maintenance. Carefully maintained steel-hulled yachts can have a lifespan of over 100 years.

As ships age, forces such as corrosion, osmosis, and rotting compromise hull strength, and a vessel becomes too dangerous to sail. At this point, it can be scuttled at sea or scrapped by shipbreakers. Ships can also be used as museum ships, or expended to construct breakwaters or artificial reefs.

Many ships do not make it to the scrapyard, and are lost in fires, collisions, grounding, or sinking at sea. The Allies lost some 5,150 ships during World War II.

== Measuring ships ==
One can measure ships in terms of length overall, length between perpendiculars, length of the ship at the waterline, beam (breadth), depth (distance between the crown of the weather deck and the top of the keelson), draft (distance between the highest waterline and the bottom of the ship) and tonnage. A number of different tonnage definitions exist and are used when describing merchant ships for the purpose of tolls, taxation, etc.
In Britain until Samuel Plimsoll&#x27;s Merchant Shipping Act of 1876, ship-owners could load their vessels until their decks were almost awash, resulting in a dangerously unstable condition. Anyone who signed on to such a ship for a voyage and, upon realizing the danger, chose to leave the ship, could end up in jail. Plimsoll, a Member of Parliament, realised the problem and engaged some engineers to derive a fairly simple formula to determine the position of a line on the side of any specific ship&#x27;s hull which, when it reached the surface of the water during loading of cargo, meant the ship had reached its maximum safe loading level. To this day, that mark, called the &quot;Plimsoll mark&quot;, &quot;freeboard mark&quot; or &quot;load line mark&quot;, exists on ships&#x27; sides, and consists of a circle with a horizontal line through the centre. On the Great Lakes of North America the circle is replaced with a diamond. Because different types of water (summer, fresh, tropical fresh, winter north Atlantic) have different densities, subsequent regulations required painting a group of lines forward of the Plimsoll mark to indicate the safe depth (or freeboard above the surface) to which a specific ship could load in water of various densities. Hence the &quot;ladder&quot; of lines seen forward of the Plimsoll mark to this day. These are called the &quot;load lines&quot; in the marine industry.

==Ship pollution==
Ship pollution is the pollution of air and water by shipping. It is a problem that has been accelerating as trade has become increasingly globalized, posing an increasing threat to the world&#x27;s oceans and waterways as globalization continues. It is expected that &quot;shipping traffic to and from the United States is projected to double by 2020.&quot; Because of increased traffic in ocean ports, pollution from ships also directly affects coastal areas. The pollution produced affects biodiversity, climate, food, and human health. However, the degree to which humans are polluting and how it affects the world is highly debated and has been a hot international topic for the past 30 years.

===Oil spills===
Oil spills have devastating effects on the environment. Crude oil contains polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) which are very difficult to clean up, and last for years in the sediment and marine environment. Marine species constantly exposed to PAHs can exhibit developmental problems, susceptibility to disease, and abnormal reproductive cycles.

By the sheer amount of oil carried, modern oil tankers must be considered something of a threat to the environment. An oil tanker can carry of crude oil, or . This is more than six times the amount spilled in the widely known &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; incident. In this spill, the ship ran aground and dumped of oil into the ocean in March 1989. Despite efforts of scientists, managers, and volunteers, over 400,000 seabirds, about 1,000 sea otters, and immense numbers of fish were killed.

The International Tanker Owners Pollution Federation has researched 9,351 accidental spills since 1974. According to this study, most spills result from routine operations such as loading cargo, discharging cargo, and taking on fuel oil. 91% of the operational oil spills were small, resulting in less than 7 tons per spill. Spills resulting from accidents like collisions, groundings, hull failures, and explosions are much larger, with 84% of these involving losses of over 700 tons.

Following the &quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; spill, the United States passed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA-90), which included a stipulation that all tankers entering its waters be double-hulled by 2015. Following the sinkings of &quot;Erika&quot; (1999) and &quot;Prestige&quot; (2002), the European Union passed its own stringent anti-pollution packages (known as Erika I, II, and III), which require all tankers entering its waters to be double-hulled by 2010. The Erika packages are controversial because they introduced the new legal concept of &quot;serious negligence&quot;.

===Ballast water===
When a large vessel such as a container ship or an oil tanker unloads cargo, seawater is pumped into other compartments in the hull to help stabilize and balance the ship. During loading, this ballast water is pumped out from these compartments.

One of the problems with ballast water transfer is the transport of harmful organisms. Meinesz believes that one of the worst cases of a single invasive species causing harm to an ecosystem can be attributed to a seemingly harmless planktonic organism . &quot;Mnemiopsis leidyi&quot;, a species of comb jelly that inhabits estuaries from the United States to the Valdés peninsula in Argentina along the Atlantic coast, has caused notable damage in the Black Sea. It was first introduced in 1982, and thought to have been transported to the Black Sea in a ship&#x27;s ballast water. The population of the comb jelly shot up exponentially and, by 1988, it was wreaking havoc upon the local fishing industry. &quot;The anchovy catch fell from in 1984 to in 1993; sprat from in 1984 to in 1993; horse mackerel from in 1984 to zero in 1993.&quot; Now that the comb jellies have exhausted the zooplankton, including fish larvae, their numbers have fallen dramatically, yet they continue to maintain a stranglehold on the ecosystem. Recently the comb jellies have been discovered in the Caspian Sea. Invasive species can take over once occupied areas, facilitate the spread of new diseases, introduce new genetic material, alter landscapes and jeopardize the ability of native species to obtain food. &quot;On land and in the sea, invasive species are responsible for about 137 billion dollars in lost revenue and management costs in the U.S. each year.&quot;

Ballast and bilge discharge from ships can also spread human pathogens and other harmful diseases and toxins potentially causing health issues for humans and marine life alike. Discharges into coastal waters, along with other sources of marine pollution, have the potential to be toxic to marine plants, animals, and microorganisms, causing alterations such as changes in growth, disruption of hormone cycles, birth defects, suppression of the immune system, and disorders resulting in cancer, tumors, and genetic abnormalities or even death.

===Exhaust emissions===

Exhaust emissions from ships are considered to be a significant source of air pollution. &quot;Seagoing vessels are responsible for an estimated 14 percent of emissions of nitrogen from fossil fuels and 16 percent of the emissions of sulfur from petroleum uses into the atmosphere.&quot; In Europe ships make up a large percentage of the sulfur introduced to the air, &quot;as much sulfur as all the cars, lorries and factories in Europe put together&quot;. &quot;By 2010, up to 40% of air pollution over land could come from ships.&quot; Sulfur in the air creates acid rain which damages crops and buildings. When inhaled, sulfur is known to cause respiratory problems and increase the risk of a heart attack.

===Ship breaking===

Ship breaking or ship demolition is a type of ship disposal involving the breaking up of ships for scrap recycling, with the hulls being discarded in ship graveyards. Most ships have a lifespan of a few decades before there is so much wear that refitting and repair becomes uneconomical. Ship breaking allows materials from the ship, especially steel, to be reused.
In addition to steel and other useful materials, however, ships (particularly older vessels) can contain many substances that are banned or considered dangerous in developed countries. Asbestos and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are typical examples. Asbestos was used heavily in ship construction until it was finally banned in most of the developed world in the mid-1980s. Currently, the costs associated with removing asbestos, along with the potentially expensive insurance and health risks, have meant that ship-breaking in most developed countries is no longer economically viable. Removing the metal for scrap can potentially cost more than the scrap value of the metal itself. In most of the developing world, however, shipyards can operate without the risk of personal injury lawsuits or workers&#x27; health claims, meaning many of these shipyards may operate with high health risks. Furthermore, workers are paid very low rates with no overtime or other allowances. Protective equipment is sometimes absent or inadequate. Dangerous vapors and fumes from burning materials can be inhaled, and dusty asbestos-laden areas around such breakdown locations are commonplace.

Aside from the health of the yard workers, in recent years, ship breaking has also become an issue of major environmental concern. Many developing nations, in which ship breaking yards are located, have lax or no environmental law, enabling large quantities of highly toxic materials to escape into the environment and causing serious health problems among ship breakers, the local population and wildlife. Environmental campaign groups such as Greenpeace have made the issue a high priority for their campaigns.

<text>A soap opera (also called a daytime drama or soap) is typically a long-running radio or television serial, frequently characterized by melodrama, ensemble casts, and sentimentality. The term &quot;soap opera&quot; originated from radio dramas originally being sponsored by soap manufacturers. The term was preceded by &quot;horse opera&quot;, a derogatory term for low-budget Westerns.

According to some dictionaries, for something to be adequately described as a soap opera, it need not be long-running; but some authors define the word in a way that excludes short-running serial dramas from their definition.

BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Archers&quot;, first broadcast in 1950, is the world&#x27;s longest-running radio soap opera. The longest-running existing television soap is &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, which was first broadcast on ITV in 1960.

According to Albert Moran, one of the defining features that make a television program a soap opera is &quot;that form of television that works with a continuous open narrative. Each episode ends with a promise that the storyline is to be continued in another episode&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; columnist Robert Lloyd wrote of daily dramas: 

Soap opera storylines run concurrently, intersect and lead into further developments. An individual episode of a soap opera will generally switch between several concurrent narrative threads that may at times interconnect and affect one another or may run entirely independent to each other. Episodes may feature some of the show&#x27;s storylines, but not always all of them. Especially in daytime serials and those that are broadcast each weekday, there is some rotation of both storyline and actors so any given storyline or actor will appear in some but usually not all of a week&#x27;s worth of episodes. Soap operas rarely conclude all their storylines at the same time. When one storyline ends, there are several other story threads at differing stages of development. Soap opera episodes typically end on some sort of cliffhanger, and the season finale (if a soap incorporates a break between seasons) ends in the same way, only to be resolved when the show returns for the start of a new yearly broadcast.

Evening soap operas and those that air at a rate of one episode per week are more likely to feature the entire cast in each episode and present all storylines. Evening soap operas and serials that run for only part of the year tend to bring things to a dramatic end-of-season cliffhanger.

In 1976, &quot;Time&quot; magazine described American daytime television as &quot;TV&#x27;s richest market&quot;, noting the loyalty of the soap opera fan base and the expansion of several half-hour series into hour-long broadcasts in order to maximise advertising revenues. The article explained that at that time, many prime time series lost money, while daytime serials earned profits several times more than their production costs. The issue&#x27;s cover notably featured its first daytime soap stars, Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth Hayes of &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, a married couple whose onscreen and real-life romance was widely covered by both the soap opera magazines and the mainstream press at large.

==Origin and history of the genre==
The first program generally considered to be a &quot;soap opera&quot; or daytime serial by scholars of the genre is &quot;Painted Dreams&quot;, which premiered on WGN radio Chicago, on October 20, 1930. It was regularly broadcast in a daytime time slot, where most listeners would be housewives; thus, the shows were aimed at – and consumed by – a predominantly female audience. &quot;Clara, Lu, &#x27;n Em&quot; would become the first &quot;network&quot; radio serial of the type when it aired on the NBC Blue Network at 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time on January 27, 1931. Although it did not make the move until February 15, 1932, &quot;Clara, Lu &#x27;n Em&quot; would become the first network serial of the type to move to a weekday daily timeslot, and so also became the first network daytime serial.

==Plots and storylines==
The main characteristics that define soap operas are &quot;an emphasis on family life, personal relationships, sexual dramas, emotional and moral conflicts; some coverage of topical issues; set in familiar domestic interiors with only occasional excursions into new locations&quot;. Fitting in with these characteristics, most soap operas follow the lives of a group of characters who live or work in a particular place, or focus on a large extended family. The storylines follow the day-to-day activities and personal relationships of these characters. &quot;Soap narratives, like those of film melodramas, are marked by what Steve Neale has described as &#x27;chance happenings, coincidences, missed meetings, sudden conversions, last-minute rescues and revelations, deus ex machina endings.&#x27;&quot; These elements may be found across the gamut of soap operas, from &quot;EastEnders&quot; to &quot;Dallas&quot;.

In many soap operas, in particular daytime serials in the United States, the characters are frequently attractive, seductive, glamorous and wealthy. Soap operas from the United Kingdom and Australia tend to focus on more everyday characters and situations and are frequently set in working-class environments. Many of the soaps produced in those two countries explore social realist storylines such as family discord, marriage breakdown or financial problems. Both British and Australian soap operas feature comedic elements, often affectionate comic stereotypes such as the gossip or the grumpy old man, presented as a comic foil to the emotional turmoil that surrounds them. This diverges from American soap operas where such comedy is rare. British soap operas frequently make a claim to presenting &quot;reality&quot; or purport to have a &quot;realistic&quot; style. British soap operas also frequently foreground their geographic location as a key defining feature of the show while depicting and capitalising on the exotic appeal of the stereotypes connected to the location. As examples, &quot;EastEnders&quot; focuses on the tough and grim life in the East End of London; &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and its characters exhibit the stereotypical characteristic of &quot;northern straight talking&quot;.

Romance, secret relationships, extramarital affairs, and genuine hate have been the basis for many soap opera storylines. In American daytime serials, the most popular soap opera characters, and the most popular storylines, often involved a romance of the sort presented in paperback romance novels. Soap opera storylines weave intricate, convoluted and sometimes confusing tales of characters who have affairs, meet mysterious strangers and fall in love, and who commit adultery, all of which keeps audiences hooked on the unfolding story. Crimes such as kidnapping, assault (sometimes sexual), and even murder may go unpunished if the perpetrator is to be retained in the ongoing story.

Australian and British soap operas also feature a significant proportion of romance storylines. In Russia, most popular serials explore the &quot;romantic quality&quot; of criminal and/or oligarch life.

In soap opera storylines, previously unknown children, siblings and twins (including the evil variety) of established characters often emerge to upset and reinvigorate the set of relationships examined by the series. Unexpected calamities disrupt weddings, childbirths, and other major life events with unusual frequency.

As in comic books – another popular form of linear storytelling pioneered in the United States during the 20th century – a character&#x27;s death is not guaranteed to be permanent. On &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, Taylor Hayes (Hunter Tylo) was shown to flatline and have a funeral. Once Tylo reprised her character in 2005, a retcon explained that Taylor had actually gone into a coma.

Stunts and complex physical action are largely absent, especially from daytime serials. Such story events often take place off-screen and are referred to in dialogue instead of being shown. This is because stunts or action scenes are difficult to adequately depict without complex movements, multiple takes, and post-production editing. When episodes were broadcast live, post-production work was impossible. Though all serials have long switched to being taped, extensive post-production work and multiple takes, while possible, are not feasible due to the tight taping schedules and low budgets.

==United States==
===Daytime serials on television===

The first daytime TV soap opera in the United States was &quot;These Are My Children&quot; in 1949, though earlier melodramas had aired in the evenings as once-a-week programs. Soap operas quickly became a fixture of American daytime television in the early 1950s, joined by game shows, sitcom reruns and talk shows.

In 1988, H. Wesley Kenney, who at the time served as the executive producer of &quot;General Hospital&quot;, said to &quot;The New York Times&quot;:
Many long-running American soap operas established particular environments for their stories. &quot;The Doctors&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot;, in the beginning, told stories almost exclusively from inside the confines of a hospital. &quot;As the World Turns&quot; dealt heavily with Chris Hughes&#x27; law practice and the travails of his wife Nancy who, tired of being &quot;the loyal housewife&quot; in the 1970s, became one of the first older women on the American serials to enter the workforce. &quot;Guiding Light&quot; dealt with Bert Bauer (Charita Bauer) and her alcoholic husband Bill, and their endless marital troubles. When Bert&#x27;s status shifted to caring mother and town matriarch, her children&#x27;s marital troubles were showcased. &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; mostly told its story through the eyes of Joanne Gardner (Mary Stuart). Even when stories revolved around other characters, Joanne was frequently a key player in their storylines. &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; initially focused on Dr. Tom Horton and his steadfast wife Alice. The show later branched out to focus more on their five children. &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; featured as its central character Mike Karr, a police detective (later an attorney), and largely dealt with organized crime. &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; first focused on two families, the prosperous Brooks family with four daughters, and the working-class Foster family of a single working mother with three children. Its storylines explored realistic problems including cancer, mental illness, poverty, and infidelity.

In contrast, &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; (1966–1971), &quot;Port Charles&quot; (1997–2003) and &quot;Passions&quot; (1999–2008) featured supernatural characters and dealt with fantasy and horror storylines. Their characters included vampires, witches, ghosts, goblins, and angels.

The American soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot; (originally titled &quot;The Guiding Light&quot; until 1975) started as a radio drama in January 1937 and subsequently began transitioning to television in June 1952; the television and radio editions of the serial continued to broadcast concurrently until the latter version ended production in 1956. With the exception of several years in the late 1940s, during which creator Irna Phillips was involved in a dispute with Procter &amp; Gamble, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; was heard or seen nearly every weekday from 1937 to 2009, making it the longest story ever told in a broadcast medium.

Originally serials were broadcast as 15-minute installments each weekday in daytime slots. In 1956, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, both produced by Procter &amp; Gamble Productions, debuted as the first half-hour soap operas on the CBS television network. All soap operas broadcast half-hour episodes by the end of the 1960s. With increased popularity in the 1970s, most soap operas had expanded to an hour in length by the end of the decade (&quot;Another World&quot; even expanded to 90 minutes for a short time from 1979 to 1980). More than half of the serials had expanded to one-hour episodes by 1980. As of 2025, four of the five American serials air one-hour episodes each weekday; only &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; airs 30-minute episodes.

Soap operas were originally broadcast live from the studio, creating what many at the time regarded as a feeling similar to that of a stage play. As nearly all soap operas were originated at that time from New York City, a number of soap actors were also accomplished stage actors who performed live theater during breaks from their soap roles. In the 1960s and 1970s, new serials such as &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;, and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; were produced in Los Angeles. Their success made the West Coast a viable alternative to New York-produced soap operas, which were becoming more costly to perform. By the early 1970s, nearly all soap operas had transitioned to being taped. &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; were the last to make the switch, in 1975.

&quot;Port Charles&quot; used the practice of running 13-week &quot;story arcs,&quot; in which the main events of the arc are played out and wrapped up over the 13 weeks, although some storylines did continue over more than one arc. According to the 2006 Preview issue of &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;, it was briefly discussed that all ABC shows might do telenovela arcs, but this was rejected.

Though American daytime soap operas are not generally rerun by their networks, occasionally they are rebroadcast elsewhere; CBS and ABC have made exceptions to this, airing older episodes (either those aired earlier in the current season or those aired years prior) on major holidays when special event programming is not scheduled or because of last-minute deferrals of scheduled episodes to the following day because of breaking news coverage. (Temporary production stoppages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic similarly resulted in CBS and ABC airing older reruns of &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot; during the Spring and Summer of 2020 in order to ration first-run episodes and, eventually, to fill airtime after the programs ran out of new episodes to broadcast; &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, which produces its episodes roughly eight months ahead of their initial broadcast, did not resort to airing older episodes during this time as it had a larger first-run episode backlog.) Early episodes of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; were rerun on PBS member stations in the early 1970s after the show&#x27;s cancellation, and the entire series (except for a single missing episode) was rerun on the Sci-Fi Channel in the 1990s. After &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; 1984 cancellation, reruns of the show&#x27;s final five years were shown late nights on USA Network from 1985 to 1989. On January 20, 2000, a digital cable and satellite network dedicated to the genre, Soapnet, began re-airing soaps that originally aired on ABC, NBC and CBS.

Newer broadcast networks launched since the late 1980s (such as Fox) and cable television networks have largely eschewed offering soap operas on their daytime schedules, instead running syndicated programming and reruns. No cable television outlet has produced its own daytime serial, although DirecTV&#x27;s The 101 Network took over existing serial &quot;Passions&quot;, continuing production for one season; while TBS and CBN Cable Network respectively aired their own soap operas, &quot;The Catlins&quot; (a primetime soap that utilized the daily episode format of its daytime counterparts) and &quot;Another Life&quot; (a soap that combined standard serial drama with religious overtones), during the 1980s. Fox, the fourth &quot;major network&quot;, carried a short-lived daytime soap &quot;Tribes&quot; in 1990. Yet, other than this and a couple of pilot attempts, Fox mainly stayed away from daytime soaps, and has not attempted them since their ascension to major-network status in 1994 (it did later attempt a series of daily prime time soaps from 2006 to 2007, which aired on newly created sister network MyNetworkTV, but the experiment was largely a failure after disappointing ratings).

Due to the masses of episodes produced for a series, release of soap operas to DVD (a popular venue for distribution of current and vintage television series) is considered impractical. With the exception of occasional specials, daytime soap operas are notable by their absence from DVD release schedules (an exception being the supernatural soap opera, &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, which did receive an essentially complete release on both VHS and DVD; the single lost episode #1219 is reconstructed by means of an off-the-air audio recording, still images, and recap material from adjacent episodes).

====Performers====
:&quot;See List of longest-serving soap opera actors&quot;

Soap opera performers in the United States are typically divided into two main groups: primary characters (sometimes referred to as &quot;contract players&quot; – as their portrayers signed contracts of employment – or leading characters) and secondary characters (sometimes referred to as recurring characters). These two groups of characters make up the vast majority of the people who appear on any given soap. There are also characters who appear only for a short time as dictated by a specific storyline, and even characters who may only get a first name and no fleshed-out character history with little dialogue (these are sometimes referred to as &quot;under-5s&quot; since they receive under five lines of dialogue in each episode).

Due to the longevity of these shows, it is not uncommon for a single character to be played by multiple actors. The key character of Mike Karr on &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; was played by three actors.

Conversely, several actors have remained playing the same character for many years, or decades even. Helen Wagner played Hughes family matriarch Nancy Hughes on American soap &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from its April 2, 1956, debut through her death in May 2010. She is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the actor with the longest uninterrupted performance in a single role. A number of performers played roles for 20 years or longer, occasionally on more than one show. Rachel Ames played Audrey Hardy on both &quot;General Hospital&quot; and &quot;Port Charles&quot; from 1964 until 2007 and returned in 2009. Susan Lucci played Erica Kane in &quot;All My Children&quot; from the show&#x27;s debut in January 1970 until it ended its network television run on ABC on September 23, 2011. Erika Slezak played Victoria Lord #3 on &quot;One Life to Live&quot; from 1971 until the show ended its network television run on ABC on January 13, 2012, and resumed the role in its short-lived online revival on April 29, 2013.

Other actors have played several characters on different shows. Millette Alexander, Bernard Barrow, Doris Belack, David Canary, Judith Chapman, Keith Charles, Jordan Charney, Joan Copeland, Nicolas Coster, Jacqueline Courtney, Augusta Dabney, Louis Edmonds, Don Hastings, Larry Haines, Vincent Irizarry, Lenore Kasdorf, Teri Keane, Lois Kibbee, John Loprieno, Lori March, Maeve McGuire, Robert Milli, James Mitchell, Lee Patterson, Christopher Pennock, Antony Ponzini, William Prince, Rosemary Prinz, Louise Shaffer, Mary Stuart, Richard Thomas, Diana van der Vlis, Mary K. Wells, Lesley Woods and Michael Zaslow, among many others, have all played multiple soap roles.

====Evolution of the daytime serial====
For several decades, most daytime soap operas concentrated on family and marital discord, legal drama and romance. The action rarely left interior settings, and many shows were set in fictional, medium-sized Midwestern towns.

Social issue storylines were typically verboten when soaps were starting, due to heavy network-imposed censorship at that time, but writer and producer Agnes Nixon introduced these storylines slowly but surely, first in 1962 when the matriarch of &quot;The Guiding Light&quot;, Bert Bauer, developed uterine cancer (as the actress, Charita Bauer, had been diagnosed with the same illness in real life). The storyline encouraged many women to get pap smears and the CBS mailroom in New York City received a then-record amount of fan mail wishing Bauer (both Bert and Charita) well. Nixon would go on to tell many socially relevant storylines on her soaps &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;All My Children&quot; in the late 1960s and into the 1970s.

Exterior shots were slowly incorporated into the series &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; and &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;. Unlike many earlier serials that were set in fictional towns, &quot;The Best of Everything&quot; and &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Hope&quot; were set in a real-world location, New York City.

The first exotic location shoot was made by &quot;All My Children&quot;, to St. Croix in 1978. Many other soap operas planned lavish storylines after the success of the &quot;All My Children&quot; shoot. Soap operas &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;Guiding Light&quot; both went to St. Croix in 1980, the former show culminating a long-running storyline between popular characters Mac, Rachel and Janice, and the latter to serve as an exotic setting for Alan Spaulding and Rita Bauer&#x27;s torrid affair. &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; taped for two weeks in Hong Kong in 1981. Later that year, some of the cast and crew ventured to Jamaica to tape a love consummation storyline between the characters of Garth and Kathy.

During the 1980s, perhaps as a reaction to the evening drama series that were gaining high ratings, daytime serials began to incorporate action and adventure storylines, more big-business intrigue, and an increased emphasis on youthful romance.

One of the most popular couples was Luke Spencer and Laura Webber on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. Luke and Laura helped to attract both male and female fans. Even actress Elizabeth Taylor was a fan and at her own request was given a guest role in Luke and Laura&#x27;s wedding episode. Luke and Laura&#x27;s popularity led to other soap producers striving to reproduce this success by attempting to create supercouples of their own.

With increasingly bizarre action storylines coming into vogue, Luke and Laura saved the world from being frozen, brought a mobster down by finding his black book in a left-handed boy statue, and helped a princess find her Aztec treasure in Mexico. Other soap operas attempted similar adventure storylines, often featuring footage shot on location – frequently in exotic locales.

During the 1990s, the mob, action and adventure stories fell out of favor with producers, due to generally declining ratings for daytime soap operas at the time. With the resultant budget cuts, soap operas were no longer able to go on expensive location shoots overseas as they were able to do in the 1980s. During that decade, soap operas increasingly focused on younger characters and social issues, such as Erica Kane&#x27;s drug addiction on &quot;All My Children&quot;, the re-emergence of Viki Lord&#x27;s dissociative identity disorder on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, and Stuart Chandler dealing with his wife Cindy dying of AIDS on &quot;All My Children&quot;. Other social issues included cancer, rape, abortion and racism.

Several shows during the 1990s and 2000s incorporated supernatural and science fiction elements into their storylines in an attempt to boost their ratings. One of the main characters on the earlier soap opera &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; was Barnabas Collins, a vampire, and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; featured an angel named Virgil. Both shows featured characters who traveled to and from the past. In 1995, &quot;Days of our Lives&quot; featured a storyline in which fan favorite character Marlena Evans was possessed by the devil (which was revisited in 2021 with the devil possessing several of her relatives as well), and in 1998, &quot;Guiding Light&quot; featured a cloning storyline involving legacy character Reva Shayne.

====Traditional grammar of daytime serials====
Modern American daytime soap operas largely stay true to the original soap opera format. The duration and format of storylines and the visual grammar employed by American daytime serials set them apart from soap operas in other countries and from evening soap operas. Stylistically, British and Australian soap operas, which are usually produced for early evening timeslots, fall somewhere in between American daytime and evening soap operas. Similar to American daytime soap operas, British and Australian serials are shot on videotape, and the cast and storylines are rotated across the week&#x27;s episodes so that each cast member will appear in some but not all episodes. British and Australian soap operas move through storylines at a faster rate than daytime serials, making them closer to American evening soap operas in this regard.

American daytime soap operas feature stylistic elements that set them apart from other shows:
* A construct unique to American daytime serials is the format where the action will cut between various conversations, returning to each at the precise moment it was left. This is the most significant distinction between American daytime soap operas and other forms of American television drama, which generally allow for narrative time to pass, off-screen, between the scenes depicted. On occasion, a character or characters involved a conversation earlier in that act may appear in a different setting later in the same act.
* In American daytime soap operas, scenes often end with a pregnant pause and a close-up on the character. There will be no dialogue for several seconds, while the music builds before cutting to a commercial or a new scene. This kind of segue is referred to in the industry as a &quot;tag&quot;.
* The traditional three-point lighting set-up routinely used in filmmaking and television production is also used on daytime soap operas, sometimes with accentuated back lighting to lift actors out of the background. This is useful in programs like soap operas, which are shot on videotape in small interior sets. The backlight is frequently more subtle on filmed productions shot on location and in larger sets.
* Domestic interiors are often furnished with stained wood wall panels and furniture, and items of brown leather furniture. This is to give a sumptuous and luxurious look suggesting the wealth of the characters. Daytime serials often foreground other sumptuous elements of set decoration; presenting a &quot;mid-shot of characters viewed through a frame of lavish floral displays, glittering crystal decanters or gleaming antique furniture&quot;.
* Few American daytime soap operas routinely feature location or exterior-shot footage (&quot;Guiding Light&quot; began shooting many of its scenes outdoors in its final two seasons). Often an outdoor locale is recreated in the studio, although in recent years, &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot; have taped certain exterior scenes within the grounds of their main soundstages. Australian and British daily soap operas invariably feature a certain amount of exterior-shot footage in every episode. This is usually shot in the same location and often on a purpose-built set, with new exterior locations for particular events.
* The visual quality of a soap opera is usually lower than prime time American television drama series due to the lower budgets and quicker production times. This is also because soap operas are recorded on videotape using a multi-camera setup, unlike prime time productions that are usually shot on film and frequently use the single-camera shooting style. Because of the lower resolution of video images, and also because of the emotional situations portrayed in soap operas, daytime serials make heavy use of close-up shots. Programs in the United States did not make the full conversion to high-definition broadcasting until September 2011, when &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; became the last soap to convert to the format; &quot;One Life to Live&quot; was an exception to this, as it continued to be produced and broadcast in standard definition – albeit in the 16:9 aspect ratio – until the end of its run on ABC in January 2012. &quot;Beyond the Gates&quot;, being the first daytime soap opera to debut in the modern high-definition era, broadcast in HD from its premiere in February 2025.
* Soap operas have idiosyncratic blocking techniques. In one common situation, a romantically involved couple starts a conversation face to face, then one character will turn 180° and face away from the other character while the conversation continues. This allows both characters to appear together in a single shot, and with both of them facing the audience. This is unrealistic in real life and is not frequently seen in film or on television outside American daytime serials, but it is an accepted soap opera convention, sometimes referred to as a &quot;two shot West&quot;.
* Because of the escapist tone of the genre and due to the large number of cast members employed by each program (usually totaling around 30 to 35 actors for hour-long soaps, and 15 to 25 for those lasting a half hour), daytime soap operas have traditionally listed all contract cast members (as well as recurring and guest actors) during the closing credits, instead of the opening title sequence. Until the 1990s, these series listed only a few of the principal actors at the end of the episode in certain episodes airing on Monday through Thursdays. Because of the aforementioned reasons, an extended credit sequence featuring a complete list of the show&#x27;s cast members, listed alongside the characters they portray, typically airs at least once per week (usually on the Friday show; although since the 2000s, most soap operas, with &quot;General Hospital&quot; as one of the few exceptions, have randomized the day the cast list is shown). &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; became the first American daytime soap to include the names of its contract actors in the opening credits in 1999 (although due to the large number of actors on contract with the show at one time, it utilizes different versions of the title sequence with a randomized list of about nine actors, increased from the seven listed in each version until 2017). &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; listed its entire main cast (as well as some actors appearing on a recurring basis) from 2004 to 2017, with &quot;General Hospital&quot; following suit from 2010 to 2013; &quot;Beyond the Gates&quot;, beginning with its 2025 premiere, uses a similar alternating title sequence structure as &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, although uniform top billing is given to a handful of its primary lead actors. ( &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Gates&quot; are the only American daytime soap operas that list the names of their main cast during both their opening titles &quot;and&quot; extended closing credit sequence.)

====Decline====
=====Statistics and trends=====
Soap opera ratings have significantly fallen in the U.S. since the 2000s. From September 2013 to February 2025, only four daytime soap operas – &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; – were still in production, down from a total of 12 soaps broadcast during the 1990–91 season and a high of 19 in the 1969–70 season; of those, three aired between two broadcast networks and one on streaming. This period marked the first time since 1953 that there were only four soap operas airing on broadcast television. &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, which has been the highest-rated soap opera since 1988, had fewer than 5 million daily viewers as of February 2012, a number exceeded by several non-scripted programs such as &quot;Judge Judy&quot;. Circulations of soap opera magazines have decreased and most have even ceased publication; &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot;, the last remaining weekly print magazine devoted to the genre, switched to a quarterly &quot;special issue&quot; publication in October 2023, although it continues to publish daily articles and episode summaries online. Soapnet, which largely aired soap opera reruns, began to be phased out in 2012 for the children&#x27;s cable channel Disney Jr., and fully ceased operations the following year. The Daytime Emmy Awards, which honor soap operas and other daytime shows, moved from prime time network television to smaller cable channels in 2012, then failed to get any TV broadcast at all in 2014, 2016, and 2017; the ceremony would eventually return to broadcast television in 2020.

Several of the most established soaps on American television ended between 2009 and 2012. The longest-running drama in television and radio history, &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, barely reached 2.1 million daily viewers in 2009 and ended on September 18 of that year, after a 72-year run (including radio). &quot;As the World Turns&quot; aired its final episode on September 17, 2010, after a 54-year run. Until it ventured back into the genre in 2024, &quot;As the World Turns&quot; was the last of 20 soap operas produced by Procter &amp; Gamble, the soap and consumer goods company from which the genre got its name. &quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;Guiding Light&quot; were also among the last of the soaps that originated from New York City. &quot;All My Children&quot;, another New York–based soap, moved its production out to Los Angeles in an effort to reduce costs and raise sagging ratings; however, both it and &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, each with a 40-year-plus run, were cancelled in 2011. &quot;All My Children&quot; aired its network finale in September 2011, with &quot;One Life to Live&quot; following suit in January 2012. Both &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; were briefly revived online in 2013, before being cancelled again amid creative and intellectual property issues between ABC and Prospect Park (the production company that acquired rights for both serials in a sub-licensing deal with ABC parent Disney), ending in September that same year. In 2019, production of &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; was put on &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot; and all of the cast&#x27;s contracts were terminated, raising concerns within soap publications that cancellation would ensue, though the show was later renewed through September 2021. In 2022, NBC announced that &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; would be moved exclusively to its streaming service, Peacock, making NBC the first of the Big Three networks not to air any daytime soap operas.

In March 2024, CBS Studios and NAACP Ventures, in partnership with P&amp;G Studios announced that a new soap opera for CBS tentatively titled &quot;The Gates&quot;, which would be the first soap opera since &quot;Generations&quot; to feature a primarily African American cast, was in development. On April 15, 2024, CBS ordered &quot;The Gates&quot; (later retitled &quot;Beyond the Gates&quot;) to series; it premiered on February 24, 2025, taking the timeslot previously occupied by panel talk show &quot;The Talk&quot; (the timeslot successor of &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, which would end its 15-season run on December 20, 2024), making it the first new daytime soap opera to premiere on a major broadcast network since NBC&#x27;s &quot;Passions&quot; in 1999.

=====Causes=====
As women increasingly worked outside of the home, daytime television viewing declined. New generations of potential viewers were not raised watching soap operas with their mothers, leaving the shows&#x27; long and complex storylines foreign to younger audiences. As viewers age, ratings continue to drop among young adult women, the demographic group for which soap opera advertisers pay the most. Those who might watch in workplace breakrooms are not counted, as Nielsen does not track television viewing outside the home. The rise of cable and the Internet has also provided new sources of entertainment during the day. The genre&#x27;s decline has additionally been attributed to reality television displacing soap operas as TV&#x27;s dominant form of melodrama. An early term for the reality TV genre was &quot;docu-soap&quot;. A precursor to reality TV, the televised 1994–95 O. J. Simpson murder case, both preempted and competed with an entire season of soaps, transforming viewing habits and leaving soap operas with 10 percent fewer viewers after the trial ended.

Daytime programming alternatives such as talk shows, game shows, and court shows cost up to 50% less to produce than scripted dramas, making those formats more profitable and attractive to networks, even if they receive the same or slightly lower ratings than soap operas. A network may even prefer to return a time slot to its local stations to keeping a soap opera with disappointing ratings on the air, as was the case with &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; and &quot;Port Charles&quot;. Compounding the financial pressure on scripted programming in the 2007–2010 period was a decline in advertising during the Great Recession, which led shows to reduce their budgets and cast sizes. In addition to these external factors, a litany of production decisions has been cited by soap opera fans as contributing to the genre&#x27;s decline, such as clichéd plots, a lack of diversity that narrowed audience appeal, and the elimination of core families.

===The primetime serial===
Serials produced for prime time slots have also found success. The first prime time soap opera was &quot;Faraway Hill&quot; (1946), which aired on October 2, 1946, on the now-defunct DuMont Television Network. &quot;Faraway Hill&quot; ran for 12 episodes and was primarily broadcast live, interspersed with short pre-recorded film clips and still photos to remind the audience of the previous week&#x27;s episode.

The first long-running prime time soap opera was &quot;Peyton Place&quot; (1964–1969) on ABC. It was based in part on the eponymous 1957 film (which, in turn, was based on the 1956 novel).

The popularity of &quot;Peyton Place&quot; prompted the CBS network to spin off popular &quot;As the World Turns&quot; character Lisa Miller into her own evening soap opera, &quot;Our Private World&quot; (originally titled &quot;The Woman Lisa&quot; in its planning stages). &quot;Our Private World&quot; was broadcast from May to September 1965. The character of Lisa (and her portrayer Eileen Fulton) returned to &quot;As The World Turns&quot; after the series ended.

The structure of &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, with its episodic plots and long-running story arcs, set the mold for the prime time serials of the 1980s, when the format reached its pinnacle.

The successful prime time serials of the 1980s included &quot;Dallas&quot;, its spin-off &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, &quot;Dynasty&quot;, and &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. These shows frequently dealt with wealthy families, and their personal and big-business travails. Common characteristics were sumptuous sets and costumes, complex storylines examining business schemes and intrigue, and spectacular disaster cliffhanger situations. Each of these series featured a wealthy, domineering, promiscuous, and passionate antagonist as a key character in the storyline – respectively, J. R. Ewing (Larry Hagman), Abby Cunningham (Donna Mills), Alexis Colby (Joan Collins), and Angela Channing (Jane Wyman). These villainous schemers became immensely popular figures that audiences &quot;loved to hate&quot;.

Unlike daytime serials, which are shot on video in a studio using the multi-camera setup, these evening series were shot on film using a single camera setup, and featured substantial location-shot footage, often in picturesque locales. &quot;Dallas&quot;, its spin-off &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, and &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; all initially featured episodes with self-contained stories and specific guest stars who appeared in just that episode. Each story was completely resolved by the end of the episode, and there were no end-of-episode cliffhangers. After the first couple of seasons, all three shows changed their story format to that of a pure soap opera, with interwoven ongoing narratives that ran over several episodes. &quot;Dynasty&quot; featured this format throughout its run.

The soap opera&#x27;s distinctive open plot structure and complex continuity was increasingly incorporated into American prime time television programs of the period. The first significant drama series to do this was &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;. This series, produced by Steven Bochco, featured many elements borrowed from soap operas, such as an ensemble cast, multi-episode storylines, and extensive character development over the course of the series. It and the later &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot; overlaid the police series formula with ongoing narratives exploring the personal lives and interpersonal relationships of the regular characters. The success of these series prompted other drama series, such as &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot; and situation comedy series, to incorporate serialized stories and story structure to varying degrees.

The prime-time soap operas and drama series of the 1990s and 2000s, such as &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, &quot;Party of Five&quot;, &quot;The O.C.&quot;, and &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, focused more on younger characters. In the 2000s, ABC began to revitalize the prime time soap opera format with shows such as &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, &quot;Private Practice&quot;, and more recently &quot;Revenge&quot;, &quot;Nashville&quot;, &quot;Scandal&quot;, &quot;Mistresses&quot;, and formerly &quot;Ringer&quot;, which its sister production company ABC Studios co-produced with CBS Television Studios for The CW. While not soaps in the traditional sense, these shows managed to appeal to wide audiences with their high drama mixed with humor, and are soap operas by definition. These successes led to NBC&#x27;s launching serials, including &quot;Heroes&quot; and &quot;Friday Night Lights&quot;. The upstart MyNetworkTV, a sister network of Fox, launched a line of prime time telenovelas (a genre similar to soap operas in terms of content) upon its launch in September 2006, but discontinued its use of the format in August 2007 after disappointing ratings.

On June 13, 2012, &quot;Dallas&quot;, a continuation of the 1978 original series premiered on the cable network, TNT. The revived series, which was canceled after three seasons in 2014, delivered solid ratings for the channel, only losing viewership after the show&#x27;s most established star, Larry Hagman, died midway through the series. In 2012, Nick at Nite debuted a primetime soap opera, &quot;Hollywood Heights&quot;, which aired episodes five nights a week (on Monday through Fridays) in a manner similar to a daytime soap opera, instead of the once-a-week episode output common of other prime time soaps. The series, which was an adaptation of the Mexican telenovela &quot;Alcanzar una estrella&quot;, suffered from low ratings (generally receiving less than 1 million viewers) and was later moved to sister cable channel TeenNick halfway through its run to burn off the remaining episodes.

In 2015, Fox debuted &quot;Empire&quot;, a prime time musical serial centering on the power struggle between family members within the titular recording company. Created by Lee Daniels and Danny Strong and led by Oscar nominees Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, the drama premiered to high ratings. The show is strongly influenced by other works such as William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;, James Goldman&#x27;s &quot;The Lion in Winter&quot; and the 1980s soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot;. Also in 2015, E! introduced &quot;The Royals&quot;, a series following the life and drama of a fictional English Royal family, which was also inspired by &quot;Dynasty&quot; (even featuring Joan Collins as the Queen&#x27;s mother). In addition, ABC debuted a prime time soap opera &quot;Blood &amp; Oil&quot;, following a young couple looking to make money off the modern-day Williston oil boom, premiering on September 27, 2015.

====List of primetime serials====
===Telenovelas===
The telenovela, a shorter-form format of serial melodrama, shares some thematic and especially stylistic similarity to the soap opera, enough that the colloquialism &quot;Spanish soap opera&quot; has arisen to describe the format. The chief difference between the two is length of series; while soap operas usually have indefinite runs, telenovelas typically have a central story arc with a prescribed ending within a year or two of the show&#x27;s launch, requiring more concise storytelling.

Spanish-language networks, chiefly Univision and Telemundo, have found success airing telenovelas for the growing U.S. Hispanic market. Both originally produced and imported Latin American dramas (as well as imported Turkish dramas since the 2020s) are popular features of the networks&#x27; daytime and primetime lineups, sometimes beating English-language networks in the ratings.

===Online serials===
Some web series are soap operas, such as &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;. In 2013, production company Prospect Park revived &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;One Life to Live&quot; for the web, retaining original creator Agnes Nixon as a consultant and keeping many of the same actors (Prospect Park purchased the rights to both series months after their cancellations by ABC in 2011, although it initially suspended plans to relaunch the soaps later that same year due to issues receiving approval from acting and production unions). Each show initially produced four half-hour episodes a week, but quickly cut back to two half-hour episodes each. In the midst of (though not directly related to) a lawsuit between Prospect Park and ABC, the experiment ended that same year, with both shows being canceled again.

==Turkey==
 Turkey is the second largest exporter of television soap operas. In 2016, Turkish TV exports earned $350 million, making it the second largest drama exporter in the world behind the United States. Turkish soap operas have a large following across Asia, the Balkans, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.

==United Kingdom==

Soap operas in the UK began on radio and consequently were associated with the BBC. It had resisted soaps as antithetical to its quality image, but began broadcasting &quot;Front Line Family&quot; in April 1941 on its North American shortwave service to encourage American intervention on Britain&#x27;s behalf in World War II. The BBC continues to broadcast the world&#x27;s longest-running radio soap, &quot;The Archers&quot;, which first aired in May 1950, and has been running nationally since 1951. It is currently broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and continues to attract over five million listeners, or roughly 25% of the radio listening population of the UK at that time of the evening.

In the UK, soap operas are one of the most popular genres, with most being broadcast during prime time. Most UK soap operas focus on everyday, working-class communities, influenced by the conventions of the kitchen sink drama. The most popular soap operas in the United Kingdom are &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, &quot;EastEnders&quot;, &quot;Emmerdale&quot;, &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, and the Australian produced &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot;. The first three of these are consistently among the highest-rated shows on British television. Such is the magnitude of the popularity of the soap genre in the UK that all television serials in the country are reputedly enjoyed by members of the British Royal Family. King Charles III himself made cameo appearances in two of the UK&#x27;s biggest serials during his time as Prince of Wales: &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;EastEnders&quot;, the latter alongside his wife Queen Camilla (then Duchess of Cornwall), in 2000 and 2022 respectively. Major events in British culture are often mentioned in the storyline, such as the Home Nations&#x27; participation at the World Cup and the death of Princess Diana. Since 1999, The British Soap Awards has been televised on ITV.

The 1986 Christmas Day episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot; is often referred to as the highest-rated UK soap opera episode ever, with 30.15 million viewers (more than half the population at the time). The figure of 30.15 million was actually a combination of the original broadcast, which had just over 19 million viewers, and the Sunday omnibus edition with 10 million viewers. The combined 30.15 million audience figure makes the aforementioned Christmas Day 1986 episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot; the highest-rated single-channel broadcast in the history of UK television. Overall it ranks third behind the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final (32.3 million viewers) and Princess Diana&#x27;s funeral in 1997 (32.1 million viewers) which were transmitted on both BBC One and ITV.

===Television===
An early television serial was &quot;The Grove Family&quot; on the BBC, which produced 148 episodes from 1954 to 1957. The programme was broadcast live and only a handful of recordings were retained in the archives. The UK&#x27;s first twice-weekly serial was ITV&#x27;s &quot;Emergency - Ward 10&quot;, running from 1957 until 1967.

In the 1960s, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; revolutionised UK television and quickly became a British institution. On 17 September 2010, it became the world&#x27;s longest-running television soap opera and was listed in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot;. The BBC also produced several serials: &quot;Compact&quot; was about the staff of a women&#x27;s magazine; &quot;The Newcomers&quot; was about the upheaval caused by a large firm setting up a plant in a small town; &quot;United!&quot; contained 147 episodes and focused on a football team; &quot;199 Park Lane&quot; (1965) was an upper class serial, which ran for only 18 episodes. None of these serials came close to making the same impact as &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Indeed, most of the 1960s BBC serials were largely wiped.

During the 1960s, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; main rival was &quot;Crossroads&quot;, a daily serial that began in 1964 and aired on ITV in the early evening. &quot;Crossroads&quot; was set in a Birmingham motel and, although the program was popular, its purported low technical standard and bad acting were much mocked. By the 1980s, its ratings had begun to decline. Several attempts to revamp the program through cast changes and, later, expanding the focus from the motel to the surrounding community were unsuccessful. &quot;Crossroads&quot; was cancelled in 1988 (a new version of &quot;Crossroads&quot; was later produced, running from 2001 until 2003).

A later rival to &quot;Coronation Street&quot; was ITV&#x27;s &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; (later renamed &quot;Emmerdale&quot;), which began in 1972 in a daytime slot and was set in rural Yorkshire. Increased viewership resulted in &quot;Emmerdale&quot; being moved to a prime-time slot in the 1980s.

&quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot; (&quot;People of the Valley&quot;) is a Welsh language serial that has been produced by the BBC since October 1974, and is the longest-running television soap opera produced by the broadcaster. &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot; was originally broadcast on BBC Wales television from 1974 to 1982; it was then moved to the Welsh-language television station S4C when it opened in November 1982. The program was occasionally shown on BBC1 in London during periods of regional optout in the mid- to late 1970s. &quot;Pobol y Cwm&quot; was briefly shown in the rest of the UK in 1994 on BBC2, with English subtitles; it is consistently the most watched programme each week on S4C.

===1980s===
Daytime soap operas were non-existent until the 1970s because there was virtually no daytime television in the UK. ITV introduced &quot;General Hospital&quot;, which later moved to a prime time slot. In 1980, Scottish Television debuted &quot;Take the High Road&quot;, which lasted for over twenty years. Later, daytime slots were filled with an influx of Australian soap operas such as &quot;The Sullivans&quot; (aired on ITV from 1977), &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; (from 1982), &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; (from 1983), &quot;A Country Practice&quot; (from 1982), &quot;Richmond Hill&quot; (from 1988 to 1989) and eventually, &quot;Neighbours&quot; was acquired by the BBC in 1986, and &quot;Home and Away&quot; aired on ITV beginning in 1989. These achieved significant levels of popularity; &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot; were moved to early-evening slots, helping begin the UK soap opera boom in the late 1980s.

The day Channel 4 began operations in 1982 it launched its own soap, the Liverpool-based &quot;Brookside&quot;, which would redefine soaps over the next decade. The focus of &quot;Brookside&quot; was different from earlier soap operas in the UK; it was set in a middle-class new-build cul-de-sac, unlike &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot;, which were set in established working-class communities. The characters in &quot;Brookside&quot; were generally either people who had advanced themselves from inner-city council estates, or the upper middle-class who had fallen on hard times. Though &quot;Brookside&quot; was still broadcast in a pre-watershed slot (8.00 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. on weekdays, around 5.00 p.m. for the omnibus on Saturdays), it was more liberal than other soaps of the time: the dialogue regularly included expletives. This stemmed from the overall more liberal policy of the channel during that period. The soap was also heavily politicised. Bobby Grant (Ricky Tomlinson), a militant trade-unionist anti-hero, was the most overtly political character. Storylines were often more sensationalist than on other soaps (throughout the soap&#x27;s history, there were two armed sieges on the street) and were staged with more violence (particularly, rape) often being featured.

In 1985, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;EastEnders&quot; debuted and became a near instant success with viewers and critics alike, with the first episode attracting over 17 million viewers. The Christmas Day 1986 episode was watched by 30.15 million viewers and contained a scene in which divorce papers were served to Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) by her husband, Queen Vic landlord Den (Leslie Grantham).

A notable success in pioneering late-night broadcasting, in October 1984, Yorkshire Television began airing the cult Australian soap opera &quot;Prisoner&quot;, which originally ran from 1979 to 1986. It was eventually broadcast on all regions of the UK in differing slots, usually around 23:00 (but never before 22:30 in any region), under the title &quot;Prisoner: Cell Block H&quot;. It was probably most popular in the Midlands where Central Television consistently broadcast the serial three times a week from 1987 to 1991. Its airing in the UK was staggered, so different regions of the country saw it at a different pace. The program was immensely successful, regularly achieving 10 million viewers when all regions&#x27; ratings per episode were added together. Central bowed to fan pressure to repeat the soap, of which the first 95 episodes aired. Then, rival station Channel 5 also acquired rights to repeat the entire rerun of the program, starting in 1997. All 692 episodes have since been released on DVD in the UK.

===1990s===
In 1992, the BBC made &quot;Eldorado&quot; to daily alternate with &quot;EastEnders&quot;. The programme was heavily criticised and only lasted one year. Nevertheless, soap operas gained increasing prominence on UK television schedules. In 1995, Channel 4 premiered &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, a soap with a youth focus which initially aired only once weekly, but became week-daily in November 2003. When Channel 5 launched in March 1997, it debuted the soap opera &quot;Family Affairs&quot;, which was formatted as a week-daily soap, airing Monday through Fridays.

&quot;Brookside&quot; premise evolved during the 1990s, phasing out the politicised stories of the 1980s and shifting the emphasis to controversial and sensationalist stories such as child rape, sibling incest, religious cults and drug addiction, including the infamous &#x27;body under the patio&#x27; storyline that ran from 1993 to 1995, and gave the serial its highest ratings ever with 9 million viewers.

&quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Brookside&quot; began releasing straight-to-video features. The &quot;Coronation Street&quot; releases generally kept the pace and style of conventional programs episodes with the action set in foreign locations. The &quot;Brookside&quot; releases were set in the usual locations, but featured stories with adult content not allowed on television pre-watershed, with these releases given &#x27;18&#x27; certificates.

&quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; was renamed &quot;Emmerdale&quot; in 1989. The series was revamped in 1993 with many changes executed via the crash of a passenger jet that partially destroyed the village and killed several characters. This attracted criticism as it was broadcast near the fifth anniversary of the Lockerbie bombing. The storyline drew the soap its highest ever audience of 18 million viewers. The revamp was a success and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; grew in popularity.

Throughout the 1990s, &quot;Brookside&quot;, &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; continued to flourish. Each increased the number of episodes that aired on a weekly basis by at least one, further defining soap operas as the leading genre in British television.

===2000s===
Since 2000, new soap operas have continued to be developed. Daytime serial &quot;Doctors&quot; began in March 2000, preceding &quot;Neighbours&quot; on BBC One and had since become the BBC&#x27;s flagship daytime series. The series was cancelled in October 2023, with the final episode screened in November 2024. In 2002, as ratings for the Scottish serial &quot;High Road&quot; (formerly &quot;Take The High Road&quot;) continued to decline, BBC Scotland launched &quot;River City&quot;, which proved popular and effectively replaced &quot;High Road&quot; when it was cancelled in 2003. The long-running serial &quot;Brookside&quot; ended in November 2003 after 21 years on the air, leaving &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; as Channel 4&#x27;s flagship serial. In 2023, it was announced that &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; had been removed from Channel 4&#x27;s early evening schedule, but would remain on E4 and Channel 4&#x27;s on demand service and would upload episodes to YouTube.

A new version of &quot;Crossroads&quot; featuring a mostly new cast was produced by Carlton Television for ITV in 2001. It did not achieve high ratings and was cancelled in 2003. In 2001, ITV also launched a new early-evening serial entitled &quot;Night and Day&quot;. This program too attracted low viewership and, after being shifted to a late night time slot, was cancelled in 2003.

&quot;Family Affairs&quot;, which was broadcast opposite the racier &quot;Hollyoaks&quot;, never achieved significantly high ratings leading to several dramatic casting revamps and marked changes in style and even location over its run. By 2004, &quot;Family Affairs&quot; had a larger fan base and won its first awards, but was cancelled in late 2005. In 2005, former &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; producer Sean O&#x27;Connor moved to &quot;Family Affairs&quot;, and planned a revamp including a new name and a younger, more glamorous cast, although these plans did not come to fruition due to the show&#x27;s axing.

In 2008, ITV premiered &quot;The Royal Today&quot;, a daily spin-off of popular 1960s-based drama &quot;The Royal&quot; (itself a spin-off of &quot;Heartbeat&quot;), which had been running in a primetime slot since 2003. Just days later, soap opera parody programme &quot;Echo Beach&quot; premiered alongside its sister show, the comedy &quot;Moving Wallpaper&quot;. Both &quot;Echo Beach&quot; and &quot;The Royal Today&quot; ended after just one series due to low ratings. Radio soap opera &quot;Silver Street&quot; debuted on the BBC Asian Network in 2004. Poor ratings and criticism of the programme led to its cancellation in 2010.

===Format===
British soap operas for many years usually only aired two nights a week. The exception was the original &quot;Crossroads&quot;, which began as a week-daily soap opera in the 1960s but later had its number of weekly broadcasts reduced.

In 1989, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; began airing three times a week. In 1996, it expanded to four episodes a week.

&quot;Brookside&quot; premiered in 1982 with two episodes a week. In 1990 it expanded to three episodes a week.

&quot;EastEnders&quot; increased its number of episodes a week in 1994 and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; did so in 1997.

&quot;Family Affairs&quot; debuted as a weekdaily soap in 1997, producing five episodes a week its entire run.

In 2004, &quot;Emmerdale&quot; began airing six episodes a week.

In a January 2008 overhaul of the ITV network, the Sunday episodes of &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; were moved out of their slots. &quot;Coronation Street&quot; added a second episode on Friday evenings at 8:30 p.m. &quot;Emmerdale&quot; Tuesday edition was extended to an hour, putting it in direct competition with &quot;EastEnders&quot;. In July 2009, the schedules of these serials were changed again. On 23 July 2009, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; moved from the Wednesday slot it held for 49 years, to Thursday evenings. &quot;Emmerdale&quot; reverted to running just one 30-minute episode on Tuesday evenings and the other 30-minute installment was moved to Thursday evenings. &quot;Coronation Street&quot; later returned to a Wednesday slot, to air Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 19:30 and 20:30. &quot;Emmerdale&quot; airs at 19:00 every weeknight, and 20:00 on Thursdays.

Later, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (which began airing two episodes on Monday nights in 2002) produced five episodes a week.

It was announced in June 2016 that starting from late 2017, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; would air six episodes a week.

&quot;Doctors&quot; aired five episodes a week until 2022, and four episodes from 2022 onwards, and is the only soap without a weekend omnibus repeat screening. &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; produces five episodes a week. The imported &quot;Neighbours&quot; screened as five new episodes a week. , &quot;EastEnders&quot; produces four episodes a week.

UK soap operas are shot on videotape in the studio using a multi-camera setup. In their early years, &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and &quot;Emmerdale&quot; used 16 mm film for footage shot on location. Since the 1980s, UK soap opera have routinely featured scenes shot outdoors in each episode. This footage is shot on videotape on a purpose-built outdoor set that represents the community which the soap focuses on.

&quot;Hollyoaks&quot; and &quot;Family Affairs&quot; were taped on high-definition video, and used the filmizing process.

==Australia==
:&quot;See List of longest-serving soap opera actors&quot;
Australia has had quite a number of well-known soap operas, some of which have gained cult followings in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and other countries. The majority of Australian television soap operas are produced for early evening or evening timeslots. They usually produce two or two and a half hours of new material each week, either arranged as four or five half-hour episodes a week, or as two one-hour episodes.

Stylistically, these series most closely resemble British soap operas in that they are nearly always shot on videotape, are mainly recorded in a studio and use a multi-camera setup. The original Australian serials were shot entirely in studio. During the 1970s occasional filmed inserts were used to incorporate sequences shot outdoors. Outdoor shooting later became commonplace and starting in the late 1970s, it became standard practice for some on-location footage to be featured in each episode of any Australian soap opera, often to capitalise on the attractiveness and exotic nature of these locations for international audiences. Most Australian soap operas focus on a mixed age range of middle-class characters and will regularly feature a range of locations where the various, disparate characters can meet and interact, such as the café, the surf club, the wine bar or the school.

===Early serials===
The genre began in Australia on radio, as it had in the United States and the United Kingdom. One such radio serial, &quot;Big Sister&quot;, featured actress Thelma Scott in the cast and aired nationally for five years beginning in 1942. Probably the best known Australian radio serial was the long-running soap opera &quot;Blue Hills&quot;, which was created by Gwen Meredith and ran from 1949 to 1976. With the advent of Australian television in 1956, daytime television serials followed. The first Australian television soap opera was &quot;Autumn Affair&quot; (1958) featuring radio personality and &quot;Blue Hills&quot; star Queenie Ashton making the transition to television. Each episode of this serial ran for 15 minutes and aired each weekday on the Seven Network. &quot;Autumn Affair&quot; failed to secure a sponsor and ended in 1959 after 156 episodes. It was followed by &quot;The Story of Peter Grey&quot; (1961), another Seven Network weekday series aired in a daytime slot in 15-minute installments. &quot;The Story of Peter Grey&quot; ran for 164 episodes.

The first successful wave of Australian evening television soap operas started in 1967 with &quot;Bellbird&quot;, produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. This rural-based serial screened in an early evening slot in 15-minute installments as a lead-in to the evening news. &quot;Bellbird&quot; was a moderate success but built up a consistent and loyal viewer base, especially in rural areas, and enjoyed a ten-year run. &quot;Motel&quot; (1968) was Australia&#x27;s first half-hour soap opera; the daytime soap had a short run of 132 episodes.

===The 1970s===
The first major soap opera hit in Australia was the sex-melodrama &quot;Number 96&quot;, a nighttime series produced by Cash Harmon Television for Network 10, which debuted March 1972. The program dealt with such topics as homosexuality, adultery, drug use, rape within marriage and racism, which had rarely been explored on Australian television programs before. The series became famous for its sex scenes and nudity and for its comedic characters, many of whom became cult heroes in Australia. By 1973, &quot;Number 96&quot; had become Australia&#x27;s highest-rated show. In 1974, the sexed-up antics of &quot;Number 96&quot; prompted the creation of &quot;The Box&quot;, which rivaled it in terms of nudity and sexual situations and was scheduled in a nighttime slot. Produced by Crawford Productions, many critics considered &quot;The Box&quot; to be a more slickly produced and better written show than &quot;Number 96&quot;. &quot;The Box&quot; also aired on the Ten Network, programmed to run right after &quot;Number 96&quot;. For 1974 &quot;Number 96&quot; was again the highest rating show on Australian television, and that year &quot;The Box&quot; occupied the number two spot.

Also in 1974, the Reg Grundy Organisation created its first soap opera, and significantly Australia&#x27;s first &quot;teen&quot; soap opera, &quot;Class of &#x27;74&quot;. With its attempts to hint at the sex and sin shown more openly on &quot;Number 96&quot; and &quot;The Box&quot;, its high school setting and early evening timeslot, &quot;Class of &#x27;74&quot; came under intense scrutiny from the Broadcasting Control Board, who vetted scripts and altered entire storylines.

By 1975, both &quot;Number 96&quot; and &quot;The Box&quot;, perhaps as a reaction to declining ratings for both shows, de-emphasised the sex and nudity shifting more towards comedic plots. &quot;Class of &#x27;74&quot; was renamed &quot;Class of &#x27;75&quot; and also added more slapstick comedy for its second year, but the revamped show&#x27;s ratings declined, resulting in its cancellation in mid-1975. That year Cash Harmon&#x27;s newly launched second soap &quot;The Unisexers&quot; failed in its early evening slot and was cancelled after three weeks; the Reg Grundy Organisation&#x27;s second soap &quot;Until Tomorrow&quot; ran in a daytime slot for 180 episodes.

A feature film version of &quot;Bellbird&quot; entitled &quot;Country Town&quot; was produced in 1971 by two of the show&#x27;s stars, Gary Gray and Terry McDermott, without production involvement by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. &quot;Number 96&quot; and &quot;The Box&quot; also released feature film versions, both of which had the same title as the series, released in 1974 and 1975 respectively. As Australian television had broadcast in black and white until 1975, these theatrical releases all had the novelty of being in colour. The film versions of &quot;Number 96&quot; and &quot;The Box&quot; also allowed more explicit nudity than could be shown on television at that time.

In November 1976 &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; debuted on the Nine Network. This Grundy Organization series eschewed the adult drama of &quot;Number 96&quot; and &quot;The Box&quot;, focusing more on relationship drama and romance. It became a popular success but received few critical accolades. A week later &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, a carefully produced period serial chronicling the effects of World War II on a Melbourne family, also debuted on Nine. Produced by Crawford Productions, &quot;The Sullivans&quot; became a ratings success, attracted many positive reviews, and won television awards. During this period &quot;Number 96&quot; re-introduced nudity into its episodes, with several much-publicised full-frontal nude scenes, a cast revamp and a new range of shock storylines designed to boost the show&#x27;s declining ratings. &quot;Bellbird&quot; experienced changes to its broadcast pattern with episodes screening in 60 minute blocks, and later in 30 minute installments.

&quot;Bellbird&quot;, &quot;Number 96&quot; and &quot;The Box&quot;, which had been experiencing declining ratings, were cancelled in 1977. Various attempts to revamp each of the shows with cast reshuffles or spectacular disaster storylines had proved only temporarily successful. &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; and &quot;The Sullivans&quot; continued to be popular. November 1977 saw the launch of successful soap opera/police procedural series &quot;Cop Shop&quot; (1977–1984) produced by Crawford Productions for Channel Seven. In early December 1977 Channel Ten debuted the Reg Grundy Organisation produced &quot;The Restless Years&quot; (1977–1981), a more standard soap drama focusing on several young school leavers.

The Seven Network, achieving success with &quot;Cop Shop&quot; produced by Crawford Productions, had Crawfords produce &quot;Skyways&quot;, a series with a similar format but set in an airport, to compete with the Nine Network&#x27;s popular talk show &quot;The Don Lane Show&quot;. &quot;Skyways&quot;, which debuted in July 1979, emphasised adult situations including homosexuality, marriage problems, adultery, prostitution, drug use and smuggling, crime, suicide, political intrigue, and murder, and featured some nudity. Despite this, the program achieved only moderate ratings and was cancelled in mid-1981.

===The 1980s===
The Reg Grundy Organisation found major success with the women&#x27;s-prison drama &quot;Prisoner&quot; (1979–1986) on Network Ten, and melodramatic family saga &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; (1982–1987) on the Seven Network. Both shows achieved high ratings in their original runs, and unusually, found success in repeats after the programs ended.

Grundy soap &quot;The Young Doctors&quot; and Crawford Productions&#x27; &quot;The Sullivans&quot; continued on the Nine Network until late 1982. Thereafter Nine attempted many new replacement soap operas produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation: &quot;Taurus Rising&quot; (1982), &quot;Waterloo Station&quot; (1983), &quot;Starting Out&quot; (1983) and &quot;Possession&quot; (1985), along with &quot;Prime Time&quot; (1986) produced by Crawford Productions. None of these programs were successful and most were cancelled after only a few months. The Reg Grundy Organisation also created &quot;Neighbours&quot;, a suburban-based daily serial devised as a gentle family drama with some comedic and lightweight situations, for the Seven Network in 1985.

Produced in Melbourne at the studios of HSV-7, &quot;Neighbours&quot; achieved high ratings in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, but not in Sydney, where it aired at 5.30 p.m. placing it against the hit dating game show &quot;Perfect Match&quot; on Channel 10. The Seven Network&#x27;s Sydney station ATN-7 quickly lost interest in &quot;Neighbours&quot; as a result of the low ratings in Sydney. HSV-7 in Melbourne lobbied heavily to keep &quot;Neighbours&quot; on the air, but ATN-7 managed to convince the rest of the network to cancel the show and instead keep ATN-7&#x27;s own Sydney-based dramas &quot;A Country Practice&quot; and &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;.

After the network cancelled &quot;Neighbours&quot;, it was immediately picked up by Channel Ten, which revamped the cast and scripts slightly and aired the series in the 7.00 p.m. slot starting 20 January 1986. It initially attracted low audiences; however, after a concerted publicity drive, Ten managed to transform the series into a major success, turning several of its actors into major international stars. The show&#x27;s popularity eventually declined and it was moved to the 6.30 p.m. slot in 1992. In January 2011 it moved to Eleven and ended after 8,903 episodes on 28 July 2022. In November 2022, Amazon Freevee revived the show with an order of 400 episodes to begin airing in 2023. It is Australia&#x27;s longest-running soap opera.

The success of &quot;Neighbours&quot; in the 1980s prompted the creation of somewhat similar suburban and family or teen-oriented soap operas such as &quot;Home and Away&quot; (1988–present) on Channel Seven and &quot;Richmond Hill&quot; (1988) on Channel Ten. Both proved popular, however &quot;Richmond Hill&quot; emerged as only a moderate success and was cancelled after one year to be replaced on Ten by &quot;E Street&quot; (1989–1993).

Nine continued trying to establish a successful new soap opera, without success. After the failure of family drama &quot;Family and Friends&quot; in 1990, it launched the raunchier and more extreme &quot;Chances&quot; in 1991, which resurrected the sex and melodrama of &quot;Number 96&quot; and &quot;The Box&quot; in an attempt to attract attention. &quot;Chances&quot; achieved only moderate ratings, and was moved to a late-night timeslot. It underwent several revamps that removed much of the original cast, and refocused the storylines to incorporate science-fiction and fantasy elements. The series continued in a late night slot until 1992, when it was cancelled due to low ratings despite the much-discussed fantasy storylines.

===Australian soaps internationally===
Several Australian soap operas have also found significant international success. In the UK, starting in the mid-1980s, daytime broadcasts of &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;, &quot;The Sullivans&quot;, &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; and &quot;Neighbours&quot; (which itself was subsequently moved to an early-evening slot) achieved significant success. Grundy&#x27;s &quot;Prisoner&quot; began airing in the United States in 1979 and achieved high ratings in many regions there, however, the show ended its run in that country three years into its run. &quot;Prisoner&quot; also aired in late-night timeslots in the UK beginning in the late 1980s, achieving enduring cult success there. The show became so popular in that country that it prompted the creation of two stage plays and a stage musical based on the show, all of which toured the UK, among many other spin-offs. In the late 1990s, Channel 5 repeated &quot;Prisoner&quot; in the UK. Between 1998 and 2005, Channel 5 ran late-night repeats of &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;. During the 1980s, the Australian attempts to emulate big-budget U.S. soap operas such as &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Dynasty&quot; had resulted in the debuts of &quot;Taurus Rising&quot; and &quot;Return to Eden&quot;, two slick soap opera dramas with big budgets that were shot entirely on film. Though their middling Australian ratings resulted in the shows running only for a single season, both programs were successfully sold internationally.

Other shows to achieve varying levels of international success include &quot;Richmond Hill&quot;, &quot;E Street&quot;, &quot;Paradise Beach&quot; (1993–1994), and &quot;Pacific Drive&quot; (1995–1997). Indeed, these last two series were designed specifically for international distribution. Channel Seven&#x27;s &quot;Home and Away&quot;, a teen soap developed as a rival to &quot;Neighbours&quot;, has also achieved significant and enduring success on UK television.

===The 1990s and beyond===
&quot;Something in the Air&quot;, a serial examining a range of characters in a small country town ran on the ABC from 2000 to 2002.

Attempts to replicate the success of daily teen-oriented serials &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot; saw the creation of &quot;Echo Point&quot; (1995) and &quot;Breakers&quot; (1999) on Network Ten. These programs foregrounded youthful attractive casts and appealing locations but the programs were not long-running successes and &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot; remained the most visible and consistently successful Australian soap operas in production. In their home country, they both attracted respectable although not spectacular ratings in the early 2000s. By 2004, &quot;Neighbours&quot; was regularly attracting just under a million viewers per episode – considered at that time a low figure for Australian prime time television. By March 2007, the Australian audience for &quot;Neighbours&quot; had fallen to fewer than 700,000 a night. This prompted a revamp of the show&#x27;s cast, its visual presentation, and a move away from the recently added action-oriented emphasis to refocus the show on the domestic storylines it is traditionally known for. During this period &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot; continued to achieve significant ratings in the UK. This and other lucrative overseas markets, along with Australian broadcasting laws that enforce a minimum amount of domestic drama production on commercial television networks, help ensure that both programs remain in production. Both shows get higher total ratings in the UK than in Australia (the UK has three times the total population of Australia) and the UK channels make a major contribution to the production costs.

It has been suggested that with their emphasis on the younger, attractive and charismatic characters, &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot; have found success in the middle ground between glamorous, fantastic U.S. soaps with their wealthy but tragic heroes and the more grim, naturalistic UK soap operas populated by older, unglamorous characters. The casts of &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;Home and Away&quot; are predominantly younger and more attractive than the casts of UK soaps, and without excessive wealth and glamour of the U.S. daytime serial, a middle-ground in which they have found their lucrative niche.

&quot;Neighbours&quot; was carried in the United States on the Oxygen cable channel in March 2004; however it attracted few viewers, perhaps in part due to its scheduling opposite well-established and highly popular U.S. soap operas such as &quot;All My Children&quot; and &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, and was dropped by the network shortly afterwards due to low ratings.

&quot;headLand&quot; made its debut on Channel Seven in November 2005, the series arose out of a proposed spinoff of &quot;Home and Away&quot; that was to have been produced in conjunction with &quot;Home and Away&quot; UK broadcaster, Channel 5. The idea for the spin-off was scuttled after Five pulled out of the deal, which meant that the show could potentially air on a rival channel in the UK; as such, Five requested that the new show be developed as a standalone series and not be spun off from a series that it owned a stake in. The series premiered in Australia on November 15, 2005, but was not a ratings success and was cancelled two months later on January 23, 2006. The series broadcast on E4 and Channel 4 in the UK. Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;H2O: Just Add Water&quot; appeared in July 2006 on Network Ten. Since Connie considered this mention as a torrid soap opera, this was mentioned in the Steven Universe episode &quot;Love Letters&quot;.

After losing the UK television rights to &quot;Neighbours&quot; to Five, the BBC commissioned a replacement serial &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;, which was produced in Australia. It debuted as part of BBC One&#x27;s weekday afternoon schedule on 28 April 2008 but low ratings prompted its move to BBC Two on 19 May 2008. The series was cancelled after its first season.

&quot;Neighbours&quot;″ continued low ratings in Australia resulted in it being moved to Ten&#x27;s new digital channel, Eleven on January 11, 2011. However, it continues to achieve reasonable ratings on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, and as of March 2013 still reportedly achieved significant international sales.

&quot;Neighbours&quot; was cancelled due to Channel 5, the UK broadcaster of the show, deciding to drop the programme – the money they were paying for the rights was providing the majority of its funding. It ended on 29 July 2022. Months after its series finale, Fremantle Australia, the programme&#x27;s production company, announced on 17 November 2022, that production on the programme would restart in 2023 after the company agreed on a deal with Amazon Freevee. Amazon Freevee aired the programme for free in the UK and the US while Network 10 retained the rights to the programme.

In February 2025, the series was cancelled again, with production concluding in July and episodes ceasing to air in December.

==New Zealand==
===Television===
Pioneering series &quot;Pukemanu&quot; aired over two years (1971–72) and was the NZBC&#x27;s first continuing drama. It followed the goings-on of a North Island timber town.
&quot;Close to Home&quot; is a New Zealand television soap opera that ran on TVNZ 1 from 1975 to 1983. At its peak in 1977 nearly one million viewers tuned in twice weekly to watch the series co-created by Michael Noonan and Tony Isaac (who had initially only agreed to make the show on the condition they would get to make &quot;The Governor&quot;). &quot;Gloss&quot; is a television drama series that screened from 1987 to 1990. The series is about a fictional publishing empire run by the Redfern family. Gloss was NZ&#x27;s answer to US soap &quot;Dynasty&quot;, with the Carrington oil scions replaced by the wealthy Redferns and their Auckland magazine empire. It was a starting point for many actors who went on to many productions in New Zealand, Australia and around the world including Temuera Morrison, Miranda Harcourt, Peter Elliott, Lisa Chappell, Danielle Cormack and Kevin Smith. Many of them would go on to star in &quot;Shortland Street&quot;, which has been New Zealand&#x27;s most popular soap since its debut in 1992. It airs on TVNZ 2.

===Radio===
Radio New Zealand began airing its first radio soap &quot;You Me Now&quot; in September 2010. It is available for podcast on its website.

==Canada==

Relatively few daily soap operas have been produced on English Canadian television, with most Canadian stations and networks that carry soap operas airing those imported from the United States or the United Kingdom. Notable daily soaps that did exist included &quot;Family Passions&quot;, &quot;Scarlett Hill&quot;, &quot;Strange Paradise&quot;, &quot;Metropia&quot;, &quot;Train 48&quot; and the international co-production &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;. &quot;Family Passions&quot; was an hour-long program, as is typical of American daytime soaps; all of the others ran half-hour episodes. Unlike American or British soap operas, the most influential of which have run for years or even decades, even daily Canadian soap operas have run for a few seasons at most. Short-run soaps, including &quot;49th &amp; Main&quot; and &quot;North/South&quot;, have also aired. Many of these were produced in an effort to comply with Canadian content regulations, which require a percentage of programming on Canadian television to originate from Canada.

Notable prime time soap operas in Canada have included &quot;Riverdale&quot;, &quot;House of Pride&quot;, &quot;Paradise Falls&quot;, &quot;Lance et Compte&quot; (&quot;He Shoots, He Scores&quot;), &quot;Heartland&quot;, &quot;Loving Friends and Perfect Couples&quot;, and &quot;The City&quot;. The &quot;Degrassi&quot; franchise of youth dramas also incorporated some elements of the soap opera format.

On French-language television in Quebec, the &quot;téléroman&quot; has been a popular mainstay of network programming since the 1950s. Notable téléromans have included &quot;Rue des Pignons&quot;, &quot;Les Belles Histoires des pays d&#x27;en haut&quot;, &quot;Diva&quot;, &quot;La famille Plouffe&quot;, and the soap opera parody &quot;Le Cœur a ses raisons&quot;.

==India==
Unlike the season-based production in most countries, most of Indian television fiction tends to be regular-broadcasting soap opera. These started in the 1980s, as more and more people began to purchase television sets. At the beginning of the 21st century, soap operas became an integral part of Indian culture when Balaji Telefilms&#x27;s Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi premiered on Disney&#x27;s 21st Century Fox owned StarPlus, becoming the highest rated show in Asia on weekdays prime time 10:30pm. Indian soap operas mostly concentrate on the conflict between love and arranged marriages occurring in India, and many includes family melodrama. Indian soap operas have multilingual production.

Many soap operas produced in India are also broadcast overseas in the UK, Canada, the United States, and some parts of Europe, South Africa, Australia and South East Asia. They are often mass-produced under large production banners, with companies like Balaji Telefilms running different language versions of the same serial on different television networks or channels.

==Europe==
===Remakes of Australian serials===

The Australian serial &quot;The Restless Years&quot; was remade in the Netherlands as (which debuted in 1990) and in Germany as &quot;Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten&quot; (which has aired since 1992): both titles translate to &quot;good times, bad times&quot;. These remakes are still airing, but have long since diverged from the original Australian storylines. The two shows are the highest-rated soap operas in their respective countries.

A later Australian serial, &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;, has inspired five remakes produced under license from the original producers and based, initially, on original story and character outlines. These are &quot;Verbotene Liebe&quot; (Germany, 1995–2015); &quot;Skilda världar&quot; (Sweden, 1996–2002); &quot;Apagorevmeni agapi&quot; (Greece, 1998); &quot;Cuori Rubati&quot; (Italy, 2002–2003) and &quot;Zabranjena ljubav&quot; (Croatia, 2004–2008). Both &quot;The Restless Years&quot; and &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot; were created and produced in Australia by the Reg Grundy Organisation.

Another Australian soap opera reformatted for a European audience was &quot;E Street&quot; which ran on Network 10 in Australia from 1989 to 1993. Germany produced 37 episodes of &quot;Westerdeich&quot; (&quot;Westside&quot;) in 1995 using scripts from 1989 episodes of &quot;E Street&quot;. It was also remade in Belgium as &quot;Wittekerke&quot; (&quot;Whitechurch&quot;) and ran from 1993 to 2008.

===Norway===

The Norwegian soap opera &quot;Hotel Cæsar&quot; aired on TV 2 from 1998 to 2017, and is the longest-running television drama in Scandinavia. Popular foreign soaps in the country include &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; (broadcast on TV6 (Norway), &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; (TNT (Norway) and &quot;Home and Away&quot; (TV 2), all of which are subtitled.

===Netherlands===

Serials have included (1990–present), &quot;Onderweg naar Morgen&quot; (1994–2010) and &quot;Goudkust&quot; (1996–2001). In 2016 &quot;Goede tijden, slechte tijden&quot; spin-off &quot;Nieuwe Tijden&quot; started airing, but was ultimately cancelled by broadcaster RTL in 2018. Linear viewership for &quot;Goede tijden, slechte tijden&quot;, the country&#x27;s most prominent soap opera, has decreased in recent years. However, due to a rising viewership on streaming platforms, RTL has decided to continue producing the show throughout the 2022/2023 television season. U.S. daytime serials &quot;As The World Turns&quot; and &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; have aired in the Netherlands; &quot;As the World Turns&quot; began airing in the country in 1990, with Dutch subtitles.

===Germany===

In the 1980s, West German networks successfully added American daytime and primetime soap operas to their schedule before Das Erste introduced its first self-produced weekly soap with &quot;Lindenstraße&quot;, which was seen as a German counterpart to &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Like in other countries, the soap opera met with negative reviews, but eventually proved critics wrong with nearly 13 million viewers tuning in each week. Even though the format proved successful, it was not until 1992 before &quot;&quot; became the first German daily soap opera. Early ratings were bad as were the reviews, but the RTL network was willing to give its first soap opera a chance; ratings would improve, climbing to 7 million viewers by 2002. Not long after , Das Erste introduced &quot;Marienhof&quot;, which aired twice a week.

After successfully creating the first German daily soap, production company Grundy Ufa wanted to produce another soap for RTL. Like &quot;GZSZ&quot;, the format was based on an Australian soap opera from Reg Watson. But RTL did not like the plot idea about separated twins who meet each other for the first time after 20 years and fall in love without knowing that they are related. The project was then taken to Das Erste, which commissioned the program, titled &quot;Verbotene Liebe&quot;, which premiered on January 2, 1995. With the premiere of &quot;Verbotene Liebe&quot;, the network turned &quot;Marienhof&quot; into a daily soap as well. In the meanwhile, RTL debuted the Grundy Ufa–produced &quot;Unter uns&quot; in late 1994.

ZDF started a business venture with Canada and co-produced the short-lived series &quot;Family Passions&quot;, starring actors such as Gordon Thomson, Roscoe Born, Dietmar Schönherr and a young Hayden Christensen. The daytime serial premiered on December 5, 1994, lasting 130 episodes. After its cancellation, the network debuted &quot;Jede Menge Leben&quot;. Even after a crossover with three soaps, &quot;Freunde fürs Leben&quot;, &quot;Forsthaus Falkenau&quot; and , the soap was canceled after 313 episodes. Sat.1 tried to get into the soap business as well, after successfully airing the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;, which was dropped in 1995 due to the talk show phenomenon that took over most of the daytime schedules of German networks. The network first tried to tell a family saga with &quot;So ist das Leben! Die Wagenfelds&quot;, before failing with &quot;Geliebte Schwestern&quot;. RTL II made its own short-lived attempt with &quot;Alle zusammen – jeder für sich&quot;.

The teen soap opera &quot;Schloss Einstein&quot; debuted on September 4, 1998, focusing on the life of a group of teenagers at the fictional titular boarding school near Berlin. As of July 2014, the series has produced over 815 episodes during the course of 17 seasons, a milestone in German television programming, and was renewed for an 18th season to debut in 2015.

In 1999, after the lasting success of , &quot;Marienhof&quot;, &quot;Unter uns&quot; and &quot;Verbotene Liebe&quot;, ProSieben aired &quot;Mallorca – Suche nach dem Paradies&quot;, set on the Spanish island with the same name. After nine months, the network canceled the program due to low viewership and high production costs. Even though ratings had improved, the show ended its run in a morning timeslot. The soap opera became something of a cult classic, as its 200-episode run was repeated several times on free-to-air and pay television.

In 2006, &quot;Alles was zählt&quot; became the last successful daily soap to make its debut, airing as a lead-in to and also produced by Grundy Ufa. Since Germany started to produce its own telenovelas, all soap operas faced declines in ratings. &quot;Unter uns&quot; was in danger of cancellation in 2009, but escaped such a fate due to budget cuts imposed by the show&#x27;s producers and the firing of original cast member Holger Franke, whose firing and the death of his character outraged fans, resulting in a ratings spike in early 2010. After &quot;Unter uns&quot; was saved, Das Erste planned to make changes to its soap lineup. &quot;Marienhof&quot; had to deal with multiple issues in its storytelling, as well as in producing a successful half-hour show. Several changes were made within months, however &quot;Marienhof&quot; was canceled in June 2011. &quot;Verbotene Liebe&quot; was in danger of being cancelled as well, but convinced the network to renew it with changes that it made in both 2010 and 2011; the soap was later expanded to 45 minutes after &quot;Marienhof&quot; was canceled, and the network tried to decide on whether to revamp its lineup.

While , &quot;Unter uns&quot; and &quot;Alles was zählt&quot; are currently the only daily soaps on the air after &quot;Verbotene Liebe&quot; has been cancelled and aired its last episode in June, 2015 due to low ratings, the telenovelas &quot;Sturm der Liebe&quot; and &quot;Rote Rosen&quot; are considered soaps by the press as well, thanks to the changing protagonists every season.

===Belgium===
In Belgium, the two major soap operas are &quot;Thuis&quot; (&quot;Home&quot;) and &quot;Familie&quot; (&quot;Family&quot;), both prime time soap operas. Soap operas have been very popular in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. &quot;Familie&quot; debuted in late 1991, and with more han 6,700 half-hour episodes, it has the highest episode total of any soap in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. The highest-rated soap opera is &quot;Thuis&quot;, which has aired on &quot;één&quot; since late 1995. &quot;Thuis&quot; is often one of the five most-watched Belgian shows and regularly garners over one million viewers (with 6.6 million Flemings in total).

During the 1990s, foreign soap operas such as &quot;Neighbours&quot; and &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; were extremely popular, the latter having achieved a cult status in Belgium and airing in the middle of the decade during prime time. Both soaps still air today, along with other foreign soaps such as &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, Australia&#x27;s &quot;Home and Away&quot; and Germany&#x27;s &quot;Sturm der Liebe&quot;. Vitaya unsuccessful attempted to air the Dutch soap opera &quot;Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden&quot; in 2010. Other foreign soaps that previously aired on Belgian television include &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;, &quot;EastEnders&quot; (both on VTM), &quot;Port Charles&quot; (at één, then known as TV1) and &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (on Vitaya). &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; aired during the 1990s on VTM for its entire run.

In the early 2000s, the only teen soap opera on Belgian television was &quot;Spring&quot; (&quot;Jump&quot; in English), which aired on the youth-oriented Ketnet and produced over 600 15-minute episodes from late 2002 until 2009, when it was cancelled after a steady decline in ratings following the departures of many of its original characters.

===Italy===

The most successful soap opera in Italy is the evening series &quot;Un posto al sole&quot; (&quot;A Place Under the Sun&quot;), which had aired on Rai 3 since 1996 (whose format is based on the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;). Several other Italian soaps have been produced such as &quot;Ricominciare&quot; (&quot;Starting Over&quot;), &quot;Cuori rubati&quot; (&quot;Stolen Hearts&quot;), &quot;Vivere&quot; (&quot;Living&quot;), &quot;Sottocasa&quot; (&quot;Downstairs&quot;), &quot;Agrodolce&quot; (&quot;Bittersweet&quot;) and &quot;Centovetrine&quot; (&quot;Hundred Shop Windows&quot;).

The most popular Italian prime-time soap opera, &quot;Incantesimo&quot; (&quot;Enchantment&quot;), which ran from 1998 to 2008, became a daytime soap opera for the final two years of its run, airing five days a week on Rai 1. The same happened with &quot;Il paradiso delle signore&quot; (&quot;Woman&#x27;s Paradise&quot;), a period drama, which ran from 2015 to 2017 in prime time, and became a daytime period soap opera from 2018.

===Ireland===
====Television====
In the early years of RTÉ, the network produced several dramas but had not come close to launching a long-running serial. RTÉ&#x27;s first television soap was &quot;Tolka Row&quot;, which was set in urban Dublin. For several years, both &quot;Tolka Row&quot; and &quot;The Riordans&quot; were produced by RTÉ; however, the urban soap was soon dropped in favor of the more popular rural soap opera &quot;The Riordans&quot;, which premiered in 1965. Executives from Yorkshire Television visited during on-location shoots for &quot;The Riordans&quot; in the early 1970s and in 1972, debuted &quot;Emmerdale Farm&quot; (now &quot;Emmerdale&quot;), based on the successful format of the Irish soap opera. In the late 1970s, &quot;The Riordans&quot; was controversially dropped. The creator of that series would then go on to produce the second of his &quot;Agri-soap&quot; trilogy &quot;Bracken&quot;, starring Gabriel Byrne, whose character had appeared in the last few seasons of &quot;The Riordans&quot;. Bracken was soon replaced by the third &quot;Agri-soap&quot; &quot;Glenroe&quot;, which ran until 2001. 

In 1989, RTÉ decided to produce its first Dublin-based soap opera since the 1960s. &quot;Fair City&quot;, which is set in the fictional city of Carrickstown, initially aired one night a week during the 1989–90 season, and similar to its rural soaps, much of the footage was filmed on location – in a suburb of Dublin City. In 1992, RTÉ made a major investment into the series by copying the houses used in the on-location shoots for an on-site set in RTÉ&#x27;s Headquarters in Dublin 4. By the early 1990s, it was airing two nights a week for 35 weeks a year. With competition from the UK soap operas, RTÉ expanded &quot;Fair City&quot; to three nights a week for most of the year and one night a week during the summer in 1996, later expanding to four nights a week and two nights during the summer. From the early 2000s, the series went through periods of airing three or four episodes a week, airing all 52 weeks of the year. &quot;Fair City&quot; currently airs Sundays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays on RTÉ One.

TG4 produce the Irish language soap &quot;Ros na Rún&quot; (&quot;Headland of the Secrets&quot; or &quot;Headland of the Sweethearts&quot;); set in the fictional village of &quot;Ros Na Rún&quot;, located outside Galway and near Spiddal, it centres on the domestic and professional lives of the town&#x27;s residents. It is modeled on an average village in the West of Ireland, but with its own distinct personality – with a diverse population that share secrets, romances and friendships among other things. While the core community has remained the same, the look and feel of &quot;Ros Na Rún&quot; has changed and evolved over the years to incorporate the changing face of rural Ireland. It has an established a place not only in the hearts and minds of the Irish speaking public, but also the wider Irish audience. The program has dealt with many topics, including domestic violence, infidelity, theft, arson, abortion, homosexuality, adoption, murder, rape, drugs, teen pregnancy and paedophilia. It runs twice a week for 35 weeks of the year, currently airing Tuesday and Thursday nights. &quot;Ros na Rún&quot; is the single largest independent production commissioned in the history of Irish broadcasting. Prior to TG4&#x27;s launch, it originally aired on RTÉ One in the early 1990s.

The first Soap to air outside RTE/TG4 was &quot;Red Rock which was broadcast on Virgin Media Ireland from January 2015 to 2020 . Red Rock aired twice a week on Wednesday and Thursday nights. Focusing on the activities of the detectives of the local Garda Síochána station and townsfolk, three series of the programme were broadcast, concluding just over five years from the date of its debut.

====Radio====
RTÉ Radio produced its first radio soap, &quot;Kennedys of Castleross&quot;, which ran from April 13, 1955, to 1975. In 1979 RTÉ long running TV soap The Riordans moved to Radio until December 24, 1985. In the mid-1980s, RTÉ debuted a new radio soap, &quot;Harbour Hotel&quot;, which ran until the mid-1990s. The network later ran two short-lived radio soaps, &quot;Konvenience Korner&quot; and &quot;Riverrun&quot;, which were followed in 2004 by &quot;Driftwood&quot;. RTÉ does not run any radio soaps, however RTÉ Radio 1 continues to air radio dramas as part of its nighttime schedule.

===Greece===

In Greece, there have been several soap operas.

====ANT1====
An early serial was &quot;Sti skia tou hrimatos&quot; (&quot;Money Shadows&quot;), which ran from 1990 to 1991. September 1991 saw the debut of &quot;Lampsi&quot; (&quot;the Shining&quot;), from creator Nicos Foskolos. The series would become Greece&#x27;s longest-running soap opera. After the success of &quot;Lampsi&quot; came the short lived &quot;To galazio diamandi&quot; (&quot;Blue Diamond&quot;) and &quot;Simphonia siopis&quot; (&quot;Omertà&quot;). &quot;Lampsi&quot; was canceled in June 2005 due to declining ratings. It was replaced by &quot;Erotas&quot; (&quot;Love&quot;), a soap that ran from 2005 to 2008. After that series ended, ANT1 abandoned the soap opera genre and focused on comedy series and weekly dramas.

Greece&#x27;s second longest-running soap is &quot;Kalimera Zoi&quot; (&quot;Goodmorning Life&quot;), which ran from September 1993 until its cancellation in June 2006 due to low ratings.

====MEGA====
Mega Channel began producing soap operas in 1990 with the prime time serial &quot;I Dipsa&quot; (&quot;The Thirst&quot;), which ran for 102 episodes. Other daytime soaps have included &quot;Paralliloi dromoi&quot; (1992–1994) and its successor &quot;Haravgi&quot; (&quot;Daylight&quot;, 1994–1995), both of which were cancelled due to low viewership; as well as the serials &quot;Apagorevmeni Agapi&quot; (&quot;Forbidden Love&quot;), which ran from 1998 to 2006; &quot;Gia mia thesi ston Ilio&quot; (&quot;A Spot Under the Sun&quot;), which ran from 1998 to 2002; &quot;Filodoxies&quot; (&quot;Expectations&quot;), which ran from 2002 to 2006; and &quot;Vera Sto Deksi&quot; (&quot;Ring on the Right Hand&quot;), which ran from 2004 to 2006 and proved to be a successful competitor to &quot;Lampsi&quot;, causing that show&#x27;s ratings to decline.

&quot;Ta Mistika Tis Edem&quot; (&quot;Edem Secrets&quot;), which was created by the producers of &quot;Vera Sto Deksi&quot;, debuted in 2008 and has eclipsed that show&#x27;s success. Its ratings place it consistently among the three highest-rated daytime programs.

====ERT====
YENED (which was renamed ERT2 in 1982) was responsible for the first Greek soap operas &quot;I Kravgi Ton Likon&quot; and &quot;Megistanes&quot;. ERT also produced the long-running soap &quot;O Simvoleografos&quot;. Since 2000 and with the introduction of private television, ERT produced additional daily soap operas, which included &quot;Pathos&quot; (&quot;Passion&quot;), &quot;Erotika tis Edem&quot; (&quot;Loving in Eden&quot;) and &quot;Ta ftera tou erota&quot; (&quot;The Wings of Love&quot;). These failed to achieve high ratings and were canceled shortly after their premiere.

====ALPHA====
Alpha produced &quot;Kato apo tin Acropoli&quot; (&quot;Under the Acropolis&quot;), which ran for 2½ years.

In 2022, Alpha produce a new soap opera &quot;Paradeisos&quot; based on the Italian soap &quot;Il Paradiso Delle Signore&quot;.

===Cyprus===
====Weekday shows====
The first daytime soap opera produced by a Cyprus channel was LOGOs TV&#x27;s &quot;Odos Den Ksehno&quot; (&quot;&#x27;Don&#x27;t Forget&#x27; Street&quot;), which ran from January to December 1996. It was followed by &quot;To Serial&quot;, which also ran for one year from September 1997 to June 1998.

CyBC created the third weekdaily soap, &quot;Anemi Tou Pathous&quot; (&quot;Passion Winds&quot;), running from January 2000 to June 2004, which was replaced by &quot;I Platia&quot; (&quot;The Square&quot;) from September 2004 to July 2006. &quot;Epikindini Zoni&quot; ran from 2009 to 2010, and was cancelled after 120 episodes. &quot;Vimata Stin Ammo&quot; made its debut in September 2010 until 2014 and was followed by &quot;Halkina Hronia&quot; (2017-2022).

Sigma TV first commissioned the weekdaily comedic soap &quot;Sto Para Pente&quot;, which aired from September 1998 to June 2004, and was the longest weekday show in Cyprus television history, before it was surpassed by &quot;Se Fonto Kokkino&quot;, which ran from September 2008 to July 2012 and then by &quot;Galateia&quot; (2016-2020).
Other Sigma TV weekday shows include &quot;Akti Oniron&quot; (which ran from 1999 to 2001), &quot;Vourate Geitonoi&quot; (which ran from 2001 to 2005, and was the most successful weekday series, achieving ratings shares of up to 70% of all television households in the country), &quot;Oi Takkoi&quot; (which ran from 2002 to 2005), &quot;S&#x27; Agapo&quot; (which ran from 2001 to 2002), &quot;Vasiliki&quot; (which ran from 2005 to 2006), &quot;Vendetta&quot; (which ran from September 2005 to December 2006), &quot;30 kai Kati&quot; (which ran from 2006 to 2007), &quot;Mila Mou&quot; (which ran from September 2007 to January 2009), &quot;7 ouranoi ke dinnefa alites&quot; (2012-2015) and &quot;Galateia&quot; (2016-2020)

ANT1 Cyprus aired the soap &quot;I Goitia Tis Amartias&quot; in 2002, which was soon canceled. &quot;Dikse Mou To Filo Sou&quot; followed from 2006 to 2009, along with &quot;Gia Tin Agapi Sou&quot;, which ran from 2008 to 2009 and itself was followed by &quot;Panselinos&quot;, which has aired 2009 to 2011.

====Weekly shows====
The longest-running weekly show on Cyprus television is &quot;Istories Tou Horkou&quot; (&quot;Villages Stories&quot;, which premiered on CyBC in March 1996 and ran until its cancellation in June 2006; it was revived in September 2010 but was cancelled again in March 2011 due to very low ratings), followed by &quot;Manolis Ke Katina&quot; (&quot;Manolis and Katina&quot;, which ran from 1995 to 2004). The most controversial of these series was &quot;To Kafenio&quot; (&quot;The Coffee Shop&quot;), which premiered on CyBC in 1993 as a weekly series, before moving to MEGA Channel Cyprus six years later in 1999 as a weekday show and then moved to ANT1 Cyprus in 2000, which canceled the show one year later. There were plans to move the show back to CyBC as a weekly series in 2001, with the original cast, however, this plan was never realised. The most successful weekly shows in Cyprus currently are ANT1&#x27;s &quot;Eleni I Porni&quot; (&quot;Eleni, The Whore&quot;), which premiered in October 2010 and CyBC&#x27;s &quot;Stin Akri Tu Paradisou&quot; (&quot;At The Heaven&#x27;s Edge&quot;), which premiered in 2007. The most successful weekdaily soap was &quot;Aigia Fuxia&quot;, which aired on ANT1 Cyprus from 2008 to 2010.

===Finland===

The Finnish soap opera, &quot;Salatut elämät&quot; (&quot;Secret Lives&quot;), has achieved popularity in Finland since its 1999 debut on MTV3. It focuses on the lives of people along the imaginary Pihlajakatu street in Helsinki. The show has also spawned several Internet spin-off series and a film based on the show that was released in 2012 and the sequel film released in 2014.

Another Finnish soap opera, &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Beach bar&quot;), started airing on MTV Sub in 2019. It focuses on the lives of the people working at the titular beach bar (later pizzeria) called Trissa, located in Taivallahti in Helsinki, and their friends and family. Rantabaari is the sister series of Salatut elämät and features some characters who formerly appeared at Salatut elämät.

Other soap-like shows in Finland are YLE shows &quot;Uusi päivä&quot; (which has aired from 2010 to 2018) and &quot;Kotikatu&quot; (which ran from 1995 to 2012), however these programs did not adhere to a five-episode-a-week schedule.

==Middle East==
UAE - KSA

AL Mirath (also known as Al Meerath or Inheritance) is the world&#x27;s first Arabic soap opera. It premiered on MBC 1 and Shahid VIP on March 1, 2020. The series is a melodramatic saga that delves into the social, economic, and cultural aspects of life in Saudi Arabia. It revolves around the intense rivalry between two families, the Bahitanis and the Khawatnis, and includes elements of romance, secrets, and schemes.

AL Mirath has been a highly successful series. Initially, it was commissioned for 250 episodes. Due to its popularity, the series continued with additional seasons, and by 2023, it had produced 750 episodes.

Egypt

In February 2022, MBC launched the first Egyptian daily soap opera, &quot;Downtown West El Balad&quot;. In Cairo, two brothers became enemies after the death of their father because the eldest son was excluded from the inheritance. 190 episodes have already been produced.

==Latin America==

In Latin America, for many years, primetime (as well as part of daytime) programming, for the most part, has been traditionally composed of telenovelas. However, throughout the years, there have been cases where a number of television programs tended to &quot;mix&quot; the concepts of television series and telenovela, such as, for example, a telenovela that lasted several seasons to end. With this &quot;overlap&quot;, many people consider that these shows could be more accurately described as &quot;soap operas&quot;. With this being said, the two most notable Latin American examples of TV programs that could fit on the definition of a &quot;soap opera&quot; are &quot;Chiquititas&quot; (in both Argentina and Brazil) and &quot;Malhação&quot; (only in Brazil).

&quot;Chiquititas&quot; was first broadcast in Argentina by Telefe in 1995 and soon became a national hit, especially among children. In regards to the audience, all eight seasons (the final season ended in 2006) of &quot;Chiquititas&quot; guaranteed the first place in the Argentine TV ratings for Telefe. Throughout the years, &quot;Chiquititas&quot; had a number of spin-offs not only in Argentina, but also in Brazil, Mexico and Portugal. In 1997, Silvio Santos, founder and owner of the Brazilian television network SBT, seeing the good ratings of &quot;Chiquititas&quot; in Argentina, decided to make a partnership with Telefe, and thus, SBT started to broadcast &quot;Chiquititas&quot; in Brazil, but in the format of &quot;remake&quot;, with the use of the Portuguese language instead of Spanish, with the use of dubbing when singing the soundtrack songs (unlike the Argentine version, on which the actors themselves sung the songs), with a Brazilian cast and with slight modifications in regards to its plot (the Brazilian version was set in the city of São Paulo instead of Buenos Aires, although many scenes of the Brazilian adaptation were actually filmed at the same Telefe studios in Buenos Aires where the Argentine version was also recorded, due to the aforementioned partnership between Telefe and SBT). The Brazilian version of &quot;Chiquititas&quot;, which lasted five seasons and ended in 2001, was successful in the ratings as well, in a slightly smaller scale compared to the Argentine version, and despite the success of &quot;Malhação&quot; (see below), the soap opera was one of the most known TV programs of the late 1990s in Brazil, enough to put &quot;Chiquititas&quot; also in the imaginary of many Brazilian children (a proof of this is that the casting process for the third season of &quot;Chiquititas&quot; in 1999 reunited about 15,000 children in the city of São Paulo alone, a record number not seen even in any Brazilian telenovela). In 2013, SBT decided to make a second adaptation of &quot;Chiquititas&quot;, which lasted two seasons (the final season ended in 2015), but unlike the first version, which resembled more like its Argentine counterpart, the second version, produced only by SBT, is different not only because the soundtrack is entirely sung by the actors themselves (as well as on the Argentine version, on which the actors did not dub the songs, but unlike the first Brazilian adaptation). Despite the fact that the ratings of the 2013 version of &quot;Chiquititas&quot; were smaller, the soap opera was not considered a failure by the critics. SBT executives evaluated the ratings as being &quot;satisfactory&quot;, and some fans consider the 2013 version to be a small &quot;revival&quot; of the 1997 version of &quot;Chiquititas&quot;.

&quot;Malhação&quot; has been transmitted by Rede Globo on almost every week since 1995 and has become the most successful Brazilian soap opera in the ratings. On each one of the 27 seasons shown as of 2021, the soap opera stayed in the first place on the ratings (like the Argentine version of &quot;Chiquititas&quot;). Moreover, &quot;Malhação&quot; also had a number of spin-offs being produced in Brazil. However, unlike &quot;Chiquititas&quot;, &quot;Malhação&quot; is more focused on teenagers, with more mature issues like teenage pregnancy, sexual relationships and the use of illicit drugs being discussed on its plot. Another interesting topic is that &quot;Malhação&quot; is considered by some fans as being the &quot;entrance door&quot; to many rookie actors who obtain the first opportunity of working on Rede Globo, because history has shown that a good acting in &quot;Malhação&quot; increases the possibility of being &quot;promoted&quot; to the primetime telenovelas (also broadcast by Rede Globo). In fact, estimates indicate that hundreds of actors participate in the casting process of &quot;Malhação&quot; each year, proving that many aspiring actors want to appear in this soap opera to further progress their careers.

==Internet and mobile soap opera==

With the advent of internet television and mobile phones, several soap operas have also been produced specifically for these platforms, including &quot;&quot;, a spin-off of the established &quot;EastEnders&quot;. For those produced only for the mobile phone, episodes may generally consist of about six or seven pictures and accompanying text.

On September 13, 2011, TG4 launched a new 10-part online series titled, &quot;Na Rúin&quot; (an Internet spin-off of &quot;Ros na Rún&quot;). The miniseries took on the theme of a mystery; the viewer had to read Rachel and Lorcán&#x27;s blogs as well as watch video diaries detailing each character&#x27;s thoughts to solve the mystery of missing teenage character Ciara.

In 1996, Canadian artificial intelligence researcher Chris McKinstry created the online soap opera &quot;CR6&quot; (an acronym for &quot;Clickable Reality&quot;); despite its obscurity, it received some media attention at the time and featured talent such as Brendan Fehr; at least eight episodes of &quot;CR6&quot; were released. It remains an early example of a web-series but despite the seemingly positive media buzz for the show, according to McKinstry, he lost over CAD$1 million on production and distribution costs, and &quot;CR6&quot; was considered a failure; while McKinstry would take his own life in 2006, thanks to the series&#x27; historical context, &quot;CR6&quot; has amassed a cult following from lost media searchers.

==Home video release==
Due to the massive number of episodes typically produced for a long-running soap opera (into the tens of thousands for some) and the fact many episodes are lost over time, home video release (in VHS, DVD or Blu-ray) of daily soap operas is generally considered impractical and impossible beyond occasional retrospective releases or highlights. A notable exception is the 1966–1971 series &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, which has had its entire run of 1,225 episodes (with an audio recreation of its sole missing episode) released to home video. In the case of American &quot;primetime soap operas&quot; this generally does not apply as typically such series produce far fewer episodes (generally on par with that of other genres), allowing home video release.

==Parodies==
In film, the 1982 comedy &quot;Tootsie&quot; has the lead character impersonating a woman in order to gain acting work on a long-running television soap opera. Several scenes parody the production of soaps, their outrageous storylines and idiosyncratic stylistic elements.

The 1991 comedy &quot;Soapdish&quot; stars Sally Field as an aging soap opera actress on the fictional series &quot;The Sun Also Sets&quot; who pines over her own neuroses and misfortunes, such as her live-in boyfriend, who leaves her to go back to his wife, and the incidents of backstabbing and scheming behind the scenes, some of which are more interesting than the stories on the programme.

Another 1991 comedy, &quot;Delirious&quot;, stars John Candy as a soap opera writer who, after a head injury, has a dream experience of being in his own creation. The dream experience is an increasingly outrageous exaggeration of soap opera plot elements.

On television, several soap opera parodies have been produced:
* &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (1967–1978) featured a recurring skit, &quot;As the Stomach Turns&quot;, that spoofed the American soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;.
* The first season of the children&#x27;s television series &quot;The Electric Company&quot; featured a recurring sketch, &quot;Love of Chair&quot;, spoofing classic soap operas. The title was based on the long-running soap opera &quot;Love of Life&quot;, and its announcer Ken Roberts was also the announcer on &quot;Love of Life&quot;.
* Two of the most famous American parodies were the series &quot;Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman&quot; (1976–1977) and &quot;Soap&quot; (1977–1981), the latter of which was a weekly sitcom/soap opera parody.
* The cult Australian prison soap opera &quot;Prisoner&quot; (1979–1986) included a spoof television soap that the inmates were occasionally seen watching called &quot;&quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow&quot;. In one episode, specially recorded audio can be heard in which two characters from the fictional soap opera play out a ludicrous script, which clearly pokes fun at the heightened melodrama of daytime soap operas.
* British soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot; (1982–2003) included an in-universe soap opera parody of itself called &quot;Meadowcroft Park&quot;&quot; which &quot;Brookside&quot; characters referenced and were occasionally seen watching. The soap was set on a newly built housing estate in Chester and real scenes, even a &quot;Part two&quot; caption, were produced for airing on the character&#x27;s houses TV&#x27;s. Notably, &quot;Meadowcroft&quot; was also the original working title of &quot;Brookside&quot;. 
* &quot;Fresno&quot; was a 1986 American miniseries spoof of the prime time serials of the period.
* The recurring &quot;Acorn Antiques&quot; skit on the UK&#x27;s &quot;Victoria Wood: As Seen on TV&quot; (1985–1987) was modeled on &quot;Crossroads&quot; and other British soap operas of the 1970s. In 1992, Wood included a new soap parody for the one-off programme &quot;Victoria Wood&#x27;s All Day Breakfast&quot; called &quot;The Mall&quot;, which was set in a shopping centre. Wood played Connie, who was a send up of Polly Perkins&#x27; character Trish Valentine in the failed BBC soap &quot;Eldorado&quot;, which was still airing at the time.
* &quot;Let the Blood Run Free&quot; (1990–1994) was an Australian parody of medical drama series.
* The 1990–1991 ABC drama &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; was a prime time series that poked fun at the genre. Episodes during the series&#x27; first season also included a fictional soap within the stories, titled &quot;Invitation to Love&quot;.
* &quot;Shark Bay&quot; (1996) was an Australian parody of glamorous beachside soap operas. It featured many actors who had appeared in Australian soap operas &quot;Sons and Daughters&quot;, &quot;Prisoner&quot;, &quot;Home and Away&quot; and &quot;Neighbours&quot;.
* The 2000–2001 WB sitcom &quot;Grosse Pointe&quot; was a self-parody of creator Darren Star&#x27;s behind-the-scenes experiences producing nighttime soaps, in particular &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;.
* South African comedian Casper de Vries produced the soap opera parody &quot;Haak en Steek&quot; (which ran from 2003 to 2004), based on South African soaps like &quot;&quot;.
* The now-cancelled ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; would often poke fun at the genre as well, even featuring a soap within the soap called &quot;Fraternity Row&quot;, which many of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; characters had either worked on or watched. Months after ABC announced in April 2011 that it would cancel &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, the series featured a storyline in which &quot;Fraternity Row&quot; itself was cancelled, leading the character of Roxy Balsom (Ilene Kristen) to desperately try and save the series, to no avail. A special episode that aired on December 19, 2011, featured the cast of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; acting out an episode of &quot;Fraternity Row&quot; in a dream of Roxy&#x27;s; the episode poked fun at both &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and the entire genre itself, featuring many soap opera stereotypes such as overacting, outrageous story lines, bad casting and incestuous relationships; it also parodied some storylines featured on the real-world soap. The second-to-last episode of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; showed characters watching the final episode of &quot;Fraternity Row&quot; and exposing the show&#x27;s last big secret: the series&#x27; main heroine and protagonist, Lorraine King Vonvaldenburg Baxter Beumont, was really a man.
* &quot;Second City TV&quot; featured &quot;The Days of the Week&quot;: &quot;Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday. Thursday. Friday. Saturday. Sunday. These are...The Days of the Week.&quot;
* The ABC comedy drama &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; (which ran from 2004 to 2012) was a semi-satirical nighttime series that took many elements from the genre.
* The Fox broadcast show &quot;Futurama&quot; has a recurring spoof of &quot;All My Children&quot; called &quot;All My Circuits&quot;.
* The Adult Swim animated series &quot;Tender Touches&quot;, which premiered in 2017, is a parody of soap operas.

<text>Software engineering is a branch of both computer science and engineering focused on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining of software applications. It involves applying engineering principles and computer programming expertise to develop software systems that meet user needs.

The terms &quot;programmer&quot; and &quot;coder&quot; overlap &quot;software engineer&quot;, but they imply only the construction aspect of typical software engineer workload.

A software engineer applies a software development process, which involves defining, implementing, testing, managing, and maintaining software systems, as well as developing the software development process itself.

== History ==

Beginning in the 1960s, software engineering was recognized as a separate field of engineering. 

The development of software engineering was seen as a struggle. Problems included software that was over budget, exceeded deadlines, required extensive debugging and maintenance, and unsuccessfully met the needs of consumers or was never even completed. 

In 1968, NATO held the first software engineering conference where issues related to software were addressed. Guidelines and best practices for the development of software were established.

The origins of the term &quot;software engineering&quot; have been attributed to various sources. The term appeared in a list of services offered by companies in the June 1965 issue of &quot;Computers and Automation&quot; and was used more formally in the August 1966 issue of &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot; (Volume 9, number 8) in &quot;President&#x27;s Letter to the ACM Membership&quot; by Anthony A. Oettinger. It is also associated with the title of a NATO conference in 1968 by Professor Friedrich L. Bauer. Margaret Hamilton described the discipline of &quot;software engineering&quot; during the Apollo missions to give what they were doing legitimacy. At the time there was perceived to be a &quot;software crisis&quot;. The 40th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2018) celebrates 50 years of &quot;Software Engineering&quot; with the Plenary Sessions&#x27; keynotes of Frederick Brooks and Margaret Hamilton.

In 1984, the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) was established as a federally funded research and development center headquartered on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States.
Watts Humphrey founded the SEI Software Process Program, aimed at understanding and managing the software engineering process. The Process Maturity Levels introduced became the Capability Maturity Model Integration for Development (CMMI-DEV), which defined how the US Government evaluates the abilities of a software development team.

Modern, generally accepted best-practices for software engineering have been collected by the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 subcommittee and published as the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK). Software engineering is considered one of the major computing disciplines.

== Terminology ==

=== Definition ===

Notable definitions of software engineering include:
* &quot;The systematic application of scientific and technological knowledge, methods, and experience to the design, implementation, testing, and documentation of software.&quot;—The Bureau of Labor Statistics—IEEE &quot;Systems and software engineering – Vocabulary&quot;
* &quot;The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.&quot;—IEEE &quot;Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology&quot;
* &quot;An engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production.&quot;—Ian Sommerville
* &quot;The establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to economically obtain software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines.&quot;—Fritz Bauer
*&quot;A branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, and maintenance of complex computer programs.&quot;—Merriam-Webster
* Software engineering&#x27; encompasses not just the act of writing code, but all of the tools and processes an organization uses to build and maintain that code over time. [...] Software engineering can be thought of as &#x27;programming integrated over time.—Software Engineering at Google

The term has also been used less formally:
* as the informal contemporary term for the broad range of activities that were formerly called computer programming and systems analysis
* as the broad term for all aspects of the &quot;practice&quot; of computer programming, as opposed to the &quot;theory&quot; of computer programming, which is formally studied as a sub-discipline of computer science
* as the term embodying the &quot;advocacy&quot; of a specific approach to computer programming, one that urges that it be treated as an engineering discipline rather than an art or a craft, and advocates the codification of recommended practices

=== Etymology ===

Margaret Hamilton promoted the term &quot;software engineering&quot; during her work on the Apollo program. The term &quot;engineering&quot; was used to acknowledge that the work should be taken just as seriously as other contributions toward the advancement of technology. Hamilton details her use of the term:When I first came up with the term, no one had heard of it before, at least in our world. It was an ongoing joke for a long time. They liked to kid me about my radical ideas. It was a memorable day when one of the most respected hardware gurus explained to everyone in a meeting that he agreed with me that the process of building software should also be considered an engineering discipline, just like with hardware. Not because of his acceptance of the new &quot;term&quot; per se, but because we had earned his and the acceptance of the others in the room as being in an engineering field in its own right.

=== Suitability ===

Individual commentators have disagreed sharply on how to define &quot;software engineering&quot; or its legitimacy as an engineering discipline. David Parnas has said that software engineering is, in fact, a form of engineering. Steve McConnell has said that it is not, but that it should be. Donald Knuth has said that programming is an art and a science. Edsger W. Dijkstra claimed that the terms &quot;software engineering&quot; and &quot;software engineer&quot; have been misused in the United States.

== Workload ==
=== Requirements analysis ===
Requirements engineering is about elicitation, analysis, specification, and validation of requirements for software. Software requirements can be functional, non-functional or domain. 

Functional requirements describe expected behaviors (i.e. outputs). Non-functional requirements specify issues like portability, security, maintainability, reliability, scalability, performance, reusability, and flexibility. They are classified into the following types: interface constraints, performance constraints (such as response time, security, storage space, etc.), operating constraints, life cycle constraints (maintainability, portability, etc.), and economic constraints. Knowledge of how the system or software works is needed when it comes to specifying non-functional requirements. Domain requirements have to do with the characteristic of a certain category or domain of projects.

=== Design ===
Software design is the process of making high-level plans for the software. Design is sometimes divided into levels: 
* Interface design plans the interaction between a system and its environment as well as the inner workings of the system.
* Architectural design plans the major components of a system, including their responsibilities, properties, and interfaces between them.
* Detailed design plans internal elements, including their properties, relationships, algorithms and data structures.

=== Construction ===
Software construction typically involves programming (a.k.a. coding), unit testing, integration testing, and debugging so as to implement the design.“Software testing is related to, but different from, ... debugging”.
Testing during this phase is generally performed by the programmer and with the purpose to verify that the code behaves as designed and to know when the code is ready for the next level of testing.

=== Testing ===
Software testing is an empirical, technical investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software under test.

When described separately from construction, testing typically is performed by test engineers or quality assurance instead of the programmers who wrote it. It is performed at the system level and is considered an aspect of software quality.

=== Program analysis ===
Program analysis is the process of analyzing computer programs with respect to an aspect such as performance, robustness, and security.

=== Maintenance ===

Software maintenance refers to supporting the software after release. It may include but is not limited to: error correction, optimization, deletion of unused and discarded features, and enhancement of existing features. 

Usually, maintenance takes up 40% to 80% of project cost.

== Education ==

Knowledge of computer programming is a prerequisite for becoming a software engineer. In 2004, the IEEE Computer Society produced the SWEBOK, which has been published as ISO/IEC Technical Report 1979:2005, describing the body of knowledge that they recommend to be mastered by a graduate software engineer with four years of experience.
Many software engineers enter the profession by obtaining a university degree or training at a vocational school. One standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees was defined by the Joint Task Force on Computing Curricula of the IEEE Computer Society and the Association for Computing Machinery, and updated in 2014. A number of universities have Software Engineering degree programs; , there were 244 Campus Bachelor of Software Engineering programs, 70 Online programs, 230 Masters-level programs, 41 Doctorate-level programs, and 69 Certificate-level programs in the United States.

In addition to university education, many companies sponsor internships for students wishing to pursue careers in information technology. These internships can introduce the student to real-world tasks that typical software engineers encounter every day. Similar experience can be gained through military service in software engineering.

===Software engineering degree programs===
Half of all practitioners today have degrees in computer science, information systems, or information technology. A small but growing number of practitioners have software engineering degrees. In 1987, the Department of Computing at Imperial College London introduced the first three-year software engineering bachelor&#x27;s degree in the world; in the following year, the University of Sheffield established a similar program. In 1996, the Rochester Institute of Technology established the first software engineering bachelor&#x27;s degree program in the United States; however, it did not obtain ABET accreditation until 2003, the same year as Rice University, Clarkson University, Milwaukee School of Engineering, and Mississippi State University. In 1997, PSG College of Technology in Coimbatore, India was the first to start a five-year integrated Master of Science degree in Software Engineering.

Since then, software engineering undergraduate degrees have been established at many universities. A standard international curriculum for undergraduate software engineering degrees, SE2004, was defined by a steering committee between 2001 and 2004 with funding from the Association for Computing Machinery and the IEEE Computer Society. , about 50 universities in the U.S. offer software engineering degrees, which teach both computer science and engineering principles and practices. The first software engineering master&#x27;s degree was established at Seattle University in 1979. Since then, graduate software engineering degrees have been made available from many more universities. Likewise in Canada, the Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) of the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers has recognized several software engineering programs.

In 1998, the US Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) established the first doctorate program in Software Engineering in the world. Additionally, many online advanced degrees in Software Engineering have appeared such as the Master of Science in Software Engineering (MSE) degree offered through the Computer Science and Engineering Department at California State University, Fullerton. Steve McConnell opines that because most universities teach computer science rather than software engineering, there is a shortage of true software engineers. ETS (École de technologie supérieure) University and UQAM (Université du Québec à Montréal) were mandated by IEEE to develop the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge (SWEBOK), which has become an ISO standard describing the body of knowledge covered by a software engineer.

== Profession ==
Legal requirements for the licensing or certification of professional software engineers vary around the world. In the UK, there is no licensing or legal requirement to assume or use the job title Software Engineer. In some areas of Canada, such as Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, software engineers can hold the Professional Engineer (P.Eng) designation and/or the Information Systems Professional (I.S.P.) designation. In Europe, Software Engineers can obtain the European Engineer (EUR ING) professional title. Software Engineers can also become professionally qualified as a Chartered Engineer through the British Computer Society.

In the United States, the NCEES began offering a Professional Engineer exam for Software Engineering in 2013, thereby allowing Software Engineers to be licensed and recognized. NCEES ended the exam after April 2019 due to lack of participation. Mandatory licensing is currently still largely debated, and perceived as controversial. 

The IEEE Computer Society and the ACM, the two main US-based professional organizations of software engineering, publish guides to the profession of software engineering. The IEEE&#x27;s &quot;Guide to the Software Engineering Body of Knowledge – 2004 Version&quot;, or SWEBOK, defines the field and describes the knowledge the IEEE expects a practicing software engineer to have. The most current version is SWEBOK v4. The IEEE also promulgates a &quot;Software Engineering Code of Ethics&quot;.

=== Employment ===

There are an estimated 26.9 million professional software engineers in the world as of 2022, up from 21 million in 2016.

Many software engineers work as employees or contractors. Software engineers work with businesses, government agencies (civilian or military), and non-profit organizations. Some software engineers work for themselves as freelancers. Some organizations have specialists to perform each of the tasks in the software development process. Other organizations require software engineers to do many or all of them. In large projects, people may specialize in only one role. In small projects, people may fill several or all roles at the same time. Many companies hire interns, often university or college students during a summer break, or externships. Specializations include analysts, architects, developers, testers, technical support, middleware analysts, project managers, software product managers, educators, and researchers.

Most software engineers and programmers work 40 hours a week, but about 15 percent of software engineers and 11 percent of programmers worked more than 50 hours a week in 2008. Potential injuries in these occupations are possible because like other workers who spend long periods sitting in front of a computer terminal typing at a keyboard, engineers and programmers are susceptible to eyestrain, back discomfort, Thrombosis, Obesity, and hand and wrist problems such as carpal tunnel syndrome.

==== United States ====
The U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) counted 1,365,500 software developers holding jobs in the U.S. in 2018. Due to its relative newness as a field of study, formal education in software engineering is often taught as part of a computer science curriculum, and many software engineers hold computer science degrees. The BLS estimates from 2023 to 2033 that computer software engineering would increase by 17%. This is down from the 2022 to 2032 BLS estimate of 25% for software engineering. And, is further down from their 30% 2010 to 2020 BLS estimate. Due to this trend, job growth may not be as fast as during the last decade, as jobs that would have gone to computer software engineers in the United States would instead be outsourced to computer software engineers in countries such as India and other foreign countries. In addition, the BLS Job Outlook for Computer Programmers, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Outlook predicts a decline of -7 percent from 2016 to 2026, a further decline of -9 percent from 2019 to 2029, a decline of -10 percent from 2021 to 2031. and then a decline of -11 percent from 2022 to 2032. Since computer programming can be done from anywhere in the world, companies sometimes hire programmers in countries where wages are lower. Furthermore, the ratio of women in many software fields has also been declining over the years as compared to other engineering fields. Then there is the additional concern that recent advances in Artificial Intelligence might impact the demand for future generations of Software Engineers. However, this trend may change or slow in the future as many current software engineers in the U.S. market flee the profession or age out of the market in the next few decades.

=== Certification ===
The Software Engineering Institute offers certifications on specific topics like security, process improvement and software architecture. IBM, Microsoft and other companies also sponsor their own certification examinations. Many IT certification programs are oriented toward specific technologies, and managed by the vendors of these technologies. These certification programs are tailored to the institutions that would employ people who use these technologies.

Broader certification of general software engineering skills is available through various professional societies. , the IEEE had certified over 575 software professionals as a Certified Software Development Professional (CSDP). In 2008 they added an entry-level certification known as the Certified Software Development Associate (CSDA). The ACM had a professional certification program in the early 1980s, which was discontinued due to lack of interest. The ACM and the IEEE Computer Society together examined the possibility of licensing of software engineers as Professional Engineers in the 1990s,
but eventually decided that such licensing was inappropriate for the professional industrial practice of software engineering. John C. Knight and Nancy G. Leveson presented a more balanced analysis of the licensing issue in 2002.

In the U.K. the British Computer Society has developed a legally recognized professional certification called &quot;Chartered IT Professional (CITP)&quot;, available to fully qualified members (&quot;MBCS&quot;). Software engineers may be eligible for membership of the British Computer Society or Institution of Engineering and Technology and so qualify to be considered for Chartered Engineer status through either of those institutions. In Canada the Canadian Information Processing Society has developed a legally recognized professional certification called &quot;Information Systems Professional (ISP)&quot;. In Ontario, Canada, Software Engineers who graduate from a &quot;Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB)&quot; accredited program, successfully complete PEO&#x27;s (&quot;Professional Engineers Ontario&quot;) Professional Practice Examination (PPE) and have at least 48 months of acceptable engineering experience are eligible to be licensed through the &quot;Professional Engineers Ontario&quot; and can become Professional Engineers P.Eng. The PEO does not recognize any online or distance education however; and does not consider Computer Science programs to be equivalent to software engineering programs despite the tremendous overlap between the two. This has sparked controversy and a certification war. It has also held the number of P.Eng holders for the profession exceptionally low. The vast majority of working professionals in the field hold a degree in CS, not SE. Given the difficult certification path for holders of non-SE degrees, most never bother to pursue the license.

=== Impact of globalization ===
The initial impact of outsourcing, and the relatively lower cost of international human resources in developing third world countries led to a massive migration of software development activities from corporations in North America and Europe to India and later: China, Russia, and other developing countries. This approach had some flaws, mainly the distance / time zone difference that prevented human interaction between clients and developers and the massive job transfer. This had a negative impact on many aspects of the software engineering profession. For example, some students in the developed world avoid education related to software engineering because of the fear of offshore outsourcing (importing software products or services from other countries) and of being displaced by foreign visa workers. Although statistics do not currently show a threat to software engineering itself; a related career, computer programming does appear to have been affected. Nevertheless, the ability to smartly leverage offshore and near-shore resources via the follow-the-sun workflow has improved the overall operational capability of many organizations. When North Americans leave work, Asians are just arriving to work. When Asians are leaving work, Europeans arrive to work. This provides a continuous ability to have human oversight on business-critical processes 24 hours per day, without paying overtime compensation or disrupting a key human resource, sleep patterns.

While global outsourcing has several advantages, global – and generally distributed – development can run into serious difficulties resulting from the distance between developers. This is due to the key elements of this type of distance that have been identified as geographical, temporal, cultural and communication (that includes the use of different languages and dialects of English in different locations). Research has been carried out in the area of global software development over the last 15 years and an extensive body of relevant work published that highlights the benefits and problems associated with the complex activity. As with other aspects of software engineering research is ongoing in this and related areas.

=== Prizes ===
There are various prizes in the field of software engineering:

* ACM-AAAI Allen Newell Award- USA. Awarded to career contributions that have breadth within computer science, or that bridge computer science and other disciplines.
* BCS Lovelace Medal. Awarded to individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the understanding or advancement of computing.
* ACM SIGSOFT Outstanding Research Award, selected for individual(s) who have made “significant and lasting research contributions to the theory or practice of software engineering.”

* More ACM SIGSOFT Awards.

* The Codie award, a yearly award issued by the Software and Information Industry Association for excellence in software development within the software industry.

* Harlan Mills Award for &quot;contributions to the theory and practice of the information sciences, focused on software engineering&quot;.

* ICSE Most Influential Paper Award.

* Jolt Award, also for the software industry.

* Stevens Award given in memory of Wayne Stevens.

== Criticism ==

Some call for licensing, certification and codified bodies of knowledge as mechanisms for spreading the engineering knowledge and maturing the field.

Some claim that the concept of software engineering is so new that it is rarely understood, and it is widely misinterpreted, including in software engineering textbooks, papers, and among the communities of programmers and crafters.

Some claim that a core issue with software engineering is that its approaches are not empirical enough because a real-world validation of approaches is usually absent, or very limited and hence software engineering is often misinterpreted as feasible only in a &quot;theoretical environment.&quot;

Edsger Dijkstra, a founder of many of the concepts in software development today, rejected the idea of &quot;software engineering&quot; up until his death in 2002, arguing that those terms were poor analogies for what he called the &quot;radical novelty&quot; of computer science:

<text>Software Engineering Institute (SEI) is a federally funded research and development center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. Founded in 1984, the institute is now sponsored by the United States Department of Defense and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, and administrated by Carnegie Mellon University.
The activities of the institute cover cybersecurity, software assurance, software engineering and acquisition, and component capabilities critical to the United States Department of Defense.

==Authority==
The Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute is a federally funded research and development center headquartered on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The SEI also has offices in Washington, DC; Arlington County, Virginia; and Los Angeles, California. The SEI operates with major funding from the U.S. Department of Defense. The SEI also works with industry and academia through research collaborations.

On November 14, 1984, the U.S. Department of Defense elected Carnegie Mellon University as the host site of the Software Engineering Institute.
The institute was founded with an initial allocation of $6 million, with another $97 million to be allocated in the subsequent five years. The SEI&#x27;s contract with the Department of Defense is subject to review and renewal every five years.

SEI focuses on several technical directions: software engineering, cybersecurity, assurance, and DoD critical component capabilities.

==Areas of work==
The SEI defines specific initiatives aimed at improving organizations&#x27; software engineering capabilities.

=== Management practices===
Organizations need to effectively manage the acquisition, development, and evolution (ADE) of software-intensive systems. Success in software engineering management practices helps organizations predict and control quality, schedule, cost, cycle time, and productivity. The best-known example of SEI in management practices is the SEI&#x27;s Capability Maturity Model (CMM) for Software (now Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)). The CMMI approach consists of models, appraisal methods, and training courses that have been proven to improve process performance. In 2006, Version 1.2 of the CMMI Product Suite included the release of CMMI for Development. CMMI for Development was the first of three constellations defined in Version 1.2: the others include CMMI for Acquisition and CMMI for Services. The CMMI for Services constellation was released in February 2009. Another management practice developed by CERT, which is part of the SEI, is the Resilience Management Model (CERT-RMM). The CERT-RMM is a capability model for operational resilience management. Version 1.0 of the Resilience Management Model was released in May 2010.

===Engineering practices===
SEI work in engineering practices increases the ability of software engineers to analyze, predict, and control selected
functional and non-functional properties of software systems. Key SEI tools and methods include the SEI Architecture Tradeoff Analysis Method (ATAM) method, the SEI Framework for Software Product Line Practice, and the SEI Service Migration and Reuse Technique (SMART).

===Security===
The SEI is also the home of the CERT/CC (CERT Coordination Center), a federally funded computer security organization. The SEI CERT Program&#x27;s primary goals are to ensure that appropriate technology and systems-management practices are used to resist attacks on networked systems and to limit damage and ensure continuity of critical services in spite of successful attacks, accidents, or failures. The SEI CERT program is working with US-CERT to produce the Build Security In (BSI) website, which provides guidelines for building security into every phase of the software development lifecycle. The SEI has also conducted research on insider threats and computer forensics. Results of this research and other information now populate the CERT Virtual Training Environment.

==Special programs==

===SEI Partner Network===
The SEI Partner Network helps the SEI disseminate software engineering best practices. Organizations and individuals in the SEI Partner Network are selected, trained, and licensed by the SEI to deliver authentic SEI services, which include courses, consulting methods, and management processes. The network currently consists of nearly 250 partner organizations worldwide.

===Conferences===
The SEI sponsors national and international conferences, workshops, and user-group meetings. Other events cover subjects including the acquisition of software-intensive systems, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)-based systems, network security and survivability, software process research, software product lines, CMMI, and the SEI Team Software Process.

===Education and training===

SEI courses are currently offered at the SEI&#x27;s locations in the United States and Europe. In addition, using licensed course materials, SEI Partners train individuals.

===Membership program===
The SEI Membership Program helps the software engineering community to network. SEI Members include small business owners, software and systems programmers, CEOs, directors, and managers from both Fortune 500 companies and government organizations.

===Affiliate program===
Through the SEI Affiliate Program, organizations place technical experts with the SEI for periods ranging from 12 months to four years. Affiliates currently are working on projects with the SEI to identify, develop, and demonstrate improved software engineering practices.

===Software Process Achievement award program===
In order to recognize outstanding achievements in improving an organization&#x27;s ability to create and evolve software-dependent systems, the SEI and IEEE Computer Society created the Software Process Achievement Award program. In addition to rewarding excellence, the purpose of this award is to foster continuous advancement in the practice of software engineering and to disseminate insights, experiences, and proven practices throughout the relevant research and practitioner communities.

==Research and publications==
The SEI publishes reports that offer new technical information about software engineering topics, whether theoretical or applied. The SEI also publishes books on software engineering for industry, government and military applications and practices.

In addition, the SEI offers public courses, workshops, and conferences in process improvement, software architecture and product lines, and security.

==Controversies==

On November 11, 2015, Roger Dingledine from the Tor Project accused the Software Engineering Institute of aiding the Federal Bureau of Investigation in uncovering the identities of users of the Tor network. Later prosecution showed the hack was paid for by the Department of Defense and subpoenaed by the FBI.

==Focus of progressive protests==
SEI has been an occasional site of anti-war movement and peace movement protests, many of which have been organized by Pittsburgh&#x27;s Thomas Merton Center.

<text>Software crisis is a term used in the early days of computing science for the difficulty of writing useful and efficient computer programs in the required time. The software crisis was due to the rapid increases in computer power and the complexity of the problems that could be tackled. With the increase in the complexity of the software, many software problems arose because existing methods were inadequate.

== History ==
The term &quot;software crisis&quot; was coined by some attendees at the first NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968 at Garmisch, Germany. Edsger Dijkstra&#x27;s 1972 Turing Award Lecture makes reference to this same problem:

== Causes ==
The causes of the software crisis were linked to the overall complexity of hardware and the software development process. The crisis manifested itself in several ways:
* Projects running over-budget
* Projects running over-time
* Software was very inefficient
* Software was of low quality
* Software often did not meet requirements
* Projects were unmanageable and code difficult to maintain
* Software was never delivered

The main cause is that improvements in computing power had outpaced the ability of programmers to effectively use those capabilities. Various processes and methodologies have been developed over the last few decades to improve software quality management such as procedural programming and object-oriented programming. However, software projects that are large, complicated, poorly specified, or involve unfamiliar aspects, are still vulnerable to large, unanticipated problems.

<doc id="27013" wikidata="Q207360" url="?curid=27013" title="Swedish Academy">
<text>The Swedish Academy (), founded in 1786 by King Gustav III, is one of the Royal Academies of Sweden. Its 18 members, who are elected for life, comprise the highest Swedish language authority. Outside Scandinavia, it is best known as the body that chooses the laureates for the annual Nobel Prize in Literature, awarded in memory of the donor Alfred Nobel.

== History ==

The Swedish Academy was founded in 1786 by King Gustav III. Modelled after the Académie française, it has 18 members. It is said that Gustaf III originally intended there to be twenty members, half the number of those in the French Academy, but eventually decided on eighteen because the Swedish expression &quot;De Aderton&quot; – &#x27;The Eighteen&#x27; – had such a fine solemn ring. The academy&#x27;s motto is &quot;Talent and Taste&quot; (&quot;Snille och Smak&quot; in Swedish). The academy&#x27;s primary purpose is to further the &quot;purity, strength, and sublimity of the Swedish language&quot; (&quot;Svenska Språkets renhet, styrka och höghet&quot;) (Walshe, 1965).

The building now known as the Stockholm Stock Exchange Building was built for the bourgeoisie. The bottom floor was used as a trading exchange (this later became the stock exchange), and the upper floor was used for balls, New Year&#x27;s Eve parties, etc. When the academy was founded, the ballroom was the biggest room in Stockholm that could be heated and thus used in the winter, so the King asked if he could borrow it.

The academy has had its annual meeting there every year since, attended by members of the Swedish royal family. However, it was not until 1914 that the academy gained permanent use of the upper floor as their own. It is here that the academy meets and, amongst other business, announces the names of Nobel Prize laureates. This task arguably makes the academy one of the world&#x27;s most influential literary bodies.

Members are elected by a secret ballot in the Academy and before the result is made public it must be submitted to the Academy&#x27;s Patron, the King of Sweden, for his approval. Members of the Academy include writers, linguists, literary scholars, historians and a prominent jurist. Initially writers were in the minority in the Academy, but during the twentieth century the number of writers grew to represent more than half of The Eighteen. The Swedish Academy have a long history of being a heavily male dominated institution, but the Academy has recently moved towards better equality. Since 20 December 2019 one third of the chairs belong to female Academy members.

Prior to 2018 it was not possible for members of the academy to resign; membership was for life, although the academy could decide to exclude members. This happened twice to Gustaf Mauritz Armfelt, who was excluded in 1794, re-elected in 1805 and excluded again in 1811. In 1989, Werner Aspenström, Kerstin Ekman and Lars Gyllensten chose to stop participating in the meetings of the academy, over its refusal to express support for Salman Rushdie when Ayatollah Khomeini condemned him to death for &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;, and in 2005, Knut Ahnlund made the same decision, as a protest against the choice of Elfriede Jelinek as Nobel laureate for 2004. On 25 November 2017, Lotta Lotass said in an interview that she had not participated in the meetings of the academy for more than two years and did not consider herself a member any more.
Dag Hammarskjöld&#x27;s former farm at Backåkra, close to Ystad in southern Sweden, was bought in 1957 as a summer residence by Hammarskjöld, then Secretary-General of the United Nations (1953–1961). The south wing of the farm is reserved as a summer retreat for the 18 members of the Swedish Academy, of which Hammarskjöld was a member.

On 11 April 2019, the academy published its financial statements for the first time in its history. According to it, the academy owned financial assets worth 1.58 billion Swedish kronor at the end of 2018 (equal to $170M, €150M, or £130M).

The Swedish King is the only person who, apart from the members, has the right to attend the meetings of the academy. On 3 March 2022 the Swedish King attended a weekly academy meeting, the first time a Swedish king has done so in over 200 years.
=== 2018 controversies ===

In April 2018, three Swedish Academy members (Klas Östergren, Kjell Espmark, and Peter Englund) resigned in response to a sexual-misconduct investigation involving author Jean-Claude Arnault, who is married to the member Katarina Frostenson. Arnault was accused of sexual assault and harassment by at least 18 women. He and his wife were also accused of leaking the names of prize recipients on at least seven occasions so friends could profit from online bets. He denied all accusations, although he was later convicted of rape and sentenced to two years and six months in prison. Sara Danius, the permanent secretary, hired a law firm to investigate if Frostenson had violated the Academy&#x27;s regulations by leaking any confidential information and whether Arnault had any influence on the Academy, but no legal action was taken. The investigation caused a division among the members of the Academy. Following a vote to stop Frostenson&#x27;s membership, the three members resigned in protest over the decisions made by the Academy. Two former permanent secretaries, Sture Allén and Horace Engdahl, called Danius a weak leader.

On 10 April, Danius was requested to resign from her position by the Academy, bringing the number of empty seats to four. Although the Academy voted against removing Katarina Frostenson from the committee, she voluntarily agreed to withdraw from participating in the academy, bringing the total of withdrawals to five. Because two other seats were still vacant from the Rushdie affair, this left only 11 active members. On 4 May 2018, the Swedish Academy announced that the selection would be postponed until 2019, when two laureates would be chosen. It was still technically possible to choose a 2018 laureate, as only eight active members are required to choose a recipient. However, there were concerns that the academy was not in any condition to credibly present the award.

The scandal was widely seen as damaging to the credibility of the prize and its authority. As noted by Andrew Brown in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in a lengthy deconstruction of the scandal: 

King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden said a reform of the rules may be evaluated, including the introduction of the right to resign in respect of the current lifelong membership of the committee. On 5 March 2019, it was announced that the Nobel Prize in Literature would once again be awarded, and laureates for both 2018 and 2019 would be announced together. The decision came after several changes were made to the structure of the Swedish Academy as well as to the Nobel Committee members selection, in order to &quot;[restore] trust in the Academy as a prize-awarding institution&quot;. On 19 November, the Swedish Academy added five temporary external members to help its five-strong Nobel Committee in their deliberations for the 2019 and 2020 awards: author and literary translator Gun-Britt Sundstrom; publisher Henrik Petersen; and literary critics Mikaela Blomqvist, Rebecka Karde and Kristoffer Leandoer. Just after two weeks, two of the newly added external members, Sundstrom and Leandoer, left the committee, with the latter saying the work to reform the scandal-hit Swedish Academy was taking too long. &quot;I leave my job in the Nobel Committee because I have neither the patience nor the time to wait for the result of the work to change that has been started,&quot; Leandoer said.

== The Academy&#x27;s dictionaries ==
In pursuance of its goals of maintaining and strengthening the Swedish language, the Academy publishes three dictionaries. The first is a one-volume spelling dictionary called &quot;Svenska Akademiens ordlista&quot; (&quot;SAOL&quot;), which is in its 14th edition. The second is a multi-volume dictionary (38 volumes so far), edited on principles similar to those of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, entitled &quot;Svenska Akademiens Ordbok&quot; (&quot;SAOB&quot;), the first volume of which was published in 1893 and the last one in 2023. The third is a two-volume dictionary edited at Gothenburg University and titled &quot;Svensk ordbok utgiven av Svenska Akademien&quot; (&#x27;Swedish dictionary published by the Swedish Academy&#x27;); it covers modern Swedish and includes pronunciations, etymologies etc, as well as definitions and some examples. In addition to printed publications, all three dictionaries are also available to access free of charge online at svenska.se.

In addition to the dictionaries the Academy has also published a four-volume grammar of the Swedish language (&quot;Svenska Akademiens grammatik&quot;, SAG) aimed at researchers, linguists and university students among others, as well as a single-volume counterpart for those requiring something less comprehensive (&quot;Svenska Akademiens språklära&quot;, SAS).

== Awards and prizes ==
Since 1901, the Swedish Academy has annually decided who will be the laureate for the Nobel Prize in Literature, awarded in memory of the donor Alfred Nobel.

The Swedish Academy annually awards nearly 50 different prizes and scholarships, most of them for domestic Swedish authors. Common to all is that they are awarded without competition and without application. The Dobloug Prize, the largest of these at $40,000, is a literature prize awarded for Swedish and Norwegian fiction.

=== The Great Prize ===
Swedish: Stora Priset, literally the Great Prize, was instituted by King Gustav III. The prize, which consists of a single gold medal, is the most prestigious award that can be awarded by the Swedish Academy. It has been awarded to, among others, Selma Lagerlöf (1904 and 1909), Herbert Tingsten (1966), Astrid Lindgren (1971), Evert Taube (1972) and Tove Jansson (1994).

=== Other awards ===
The academy awards around 50 prizes each year. A person does not have to apply nor compete for the prizes.

<text>South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), is a country in East Asia. It constitutes the southern half of the Korean Peninsula and borders North Korea along the Korean Demilitarized Zone, with the Yellow Sea to the west and the Sea of Japan to the east. Like North Korea, South Korea claims to be the sole legitimate government of the entire peninsula and adjacent islands. It has a population of 51.71 million, of which half live in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, the ninth most populous metropolitan area in the world; other major cities include Busan, Daegu, and Incheon.

The Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period. Its first kingdom was noted in Chinese records in the early seventh century BCE. From the mid first century BCE, various polities consolidated into the rival kingdoms of Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla, with the lattermost unifying the peninsula for the first time in the late seventh century CE. The Goryeo dynasty (918–1392) achieved lasting unification and established the basis for modern Korean identity. The subsequent Joseon dynasty (1392–1897) saw the height of cultural, economic, and scientific achievement as well as prolonged peace and isolationism from the mid 17th century. The succeeding Korean Empire (1897–1910) sought modernization and reform by was annexed in 1910 into the Empire of Japan. Japanese rule ended following Japan&#x27;s surrender in World War II, after which Korea was divided into two zones: a northern zone, which was occupied by the Soviet Union, and a southern zone, which was occupied by the United States. After negotiations on reunification failed, the southern zone became the Republic of Korea in August 1948, while the northern zone became the communist Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea the following month.

In 1950, a North Korean invasion triggered the Korean War, one of the first major proxy conflicts of the Cold War, which saw extensive fighting involving the American-led United Nations Command and the Soviet-backed People&#x27;s Volunteer Army from China. The war ended in 1953 with an armistice but no peace treaty, leading to the ongoing Korean conflict, and left three million Koreans dead and the economy in ruins. South Korea endured a series of dictatorships punctuated by coups, revolutions, and violent uprisings, but also experienced a soaring economy and one of the fastest rises in average GDP per capita, leading to its emergence as one of the Four Asian Tigers. The June Democratic Struggle of 1987 ended authoritarian rule and led to the establishment of the current Sixth Republic. 

South Korea is now considered among the most advanced democracies in continental and East Asia. Under the 1987 constitution, it maintains a unitary presidential republic with a popularly elected unicameral legislature, the National Assembly. South Korea is a major non-NATO ally of the United States and is regarded as a regional power in East Asia and an emerging power in global affairs; its conscription-based armed forces are ranked as one of the strongest in the world and have the second highest number of military and paramilitary personnel. A highly developed country, 2025, South Korea&#x27;s economy is ranked 12th largest in the world by nominal GDP and PPP-adjusted GDP is ranked 14th largest in the world. it is the world&#x27;s eleventh-largest exporter and seventh-largest importer.

South Korea performs well in metrics of education, human development, democratic governance, and innovation. Its citizens enjoy one of the world&#x27;s longest life expectances and access to some of the fastest Internet connection speeds and densest high-speed railway networks. Since the turn of the 21st century, the country has been renowned for its globally influential pop culture, particularly in music, TV dramas, and cinema, a phenomenon referred to as the Korean Wave. South Korea is a member of the OECD&#x27;s Development Assistance Committee, the G20, the IPEF, and the Paris Club.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Korea&quot; is an exonym derived from the historical Korean kingdom name &quot;Goryeo&quot; (). &quot;Goryeo&quot; was the shortened name officially adopted by Goguryeo in the 5th century and the name of its 10th-century successor state Goryeo. Visiting Arab and Persian merchants pronounced its name as &quot;Korea&quot;. The modern name of Korea appears in the first Portuguese maps of 1568 by João vaz Dourado as &quot;Conrai&quot; and later in the late 16th century and early 17th century as &quot;Corea&quot; (Korea) in the maps of Teixeira Albernaz of 1630.

The Kingdom of Goryeo became first known to Westerners when Afonso de Albuquerque conquered Malacca in 1511 and described the peoples who traded with this part of the world known by the Portuguese as the &quot;Gores&quot;. Despite the coexistence of the spellings &quot;Corea&quot; and &quot;Korea&quot; in 19th-century publications, some Koreans believe that Imperial Japan, around the time of the Japanese occupation, intentionally standardized the spelling of &quot;Korea&quot;, making Japan appear first alphabetically.

After Goryeo was replaced by the Kingdom of Joseon () in 1392, Joseon became the official name for the entire territory, though it was not universally accepted. The new official name has its origin in the ancient kingdom of Gojoseon (2333 BCE). In 1897, the Joseon dynasty changed the country&#x27;s official name from &quot;Joseon&quot; to the Korean Empire (). A portion of the Korean Empire&#x27;s name &quot;Daehan&quot; () derives from Samhan (Three Han), referring to the Three Kingdoms of Korea, not the ancient confederacies in the southern Korean Peninsula. However, the name &quot;Joseon&quot; was still widely used by Koreans to refer to their country, even though it was no longer the official name. Under Japanese rule, the two names &quot;Han&quot; and &quot;Joseon&quot; coexisted.

Following the surrender of Japan, in 1945, the &quot;Republic of Korea&quot; was adopted as the legal English name for the new country. However, it is not a direct translation of the Korean name. As a result, the Korean name &quot;Daehan Minguk&quot; () is sometimes used by South Koreans as a metonym to refer to the Korean ethnicity (or &quot;race&quot;) as a whole, rather than just the South Korean state.

== History ==
=== Ancient Korea ===

The Korean Peninsula was inhabited as early as the Lower Paleolithic period.

According to Korea&#x27;s founding mythology, the history of Korea begins with the founding of Joseon (also known as &quot;Gojoseon&quot;, or &quot;Old Joseon&quot;, to differentiate it from the 14th century dynasty) in 2333 BCE by the legendary Dangun. Gojoseon was noted in Chinese records in the early 7th century. Gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern Korean Peninsula and parts of Manchuria. Gija Joseon was purportedly founded in the 12th century BCE, but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era. In 108 BCE, the Han dynasty defeated Wiman Joseon and installed four commanderies in the northern Korean peninsula. Three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades. As Lelang Commandery was destroyed and rebuilt around this time, the place gradually moved toward Liaodong. Thus, its force was diminished and only served as a trade center until it was conquered by Goguryeo in 313.

Beginning around 300 BC, the Japonic-speaking Yayoi people from the Korean Peninsula entered the Japanese islands and displaced or intermingled with the original Jōmon inhabitants. The linguistic homeland of Proto-Koreans is located somewhere in southern Siberia/Manchuria, such as the Liao River area or the Amur River area. Proto-Koreans arrived in the southern part of the Korean Peninsula at around 300 BC, replacing and assimilating Japonic-speakers and likely causing the Yayoi migration.

=== Three Kingdoms of Korea ===
During the Proto–Three Kingdoms period, the states of Buyeo, Okjeo, Dongye, and Samhan occupied the whole Korean peninsula and southern Manchuria. From them, the Three Kingdoms of Korea emerged: Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla.

Goguryeo, the largest and most powerful among them, was a highly militaristic state and competed with various Chinese dynasties during its 700 years of history. Goguryeo experienced a golden age under Gwanggaeto the Great and his son Jangsu, who both subdued Baekje and Silla during their respective reigns, achieving a brief unification of the Three Kingdoms and becoming the most dominant power on the Korean Peninsula. In addition to contesting control of the Korean Peninsula, Goguryeo had many military conflicts with various Chinese dynasties, most notably the Goguryeo–Sui War, in which Goguryeo defeated a huge force said to number over a million men.

Baekje was a maritime power, sometimes called the &quot;Phoenicia of East Asia&quot;. Its maritime ability was instrumental in the dissemination of Buddhism throughout East Asia and spreading continental culture to Japan. Baekje was once a great military power on the Korean Peninsula, especially during the time of Geunchogo, but was critically defeated by Gwanggaeto the Great and declined. Silla was the smallest and weakest of the three, but used opportunistic pacts and alliances with the more powerful Korean kingdoms, and eventually Tang China, to its advantage.

In 676, the unification of the Three Kingdoms by Silla led to the Northern and Southern States period, in which Balhae controlled the northern parts of Goguryeo, and much of the Korean Peninsula was controlled by Later Silla. Relationships between Korea and China remained relatively peaceful during this time. Balhae was founded by a Goguryeo general and formed as a successor state to Goguryeo. During its height, Balhae controlled most of Manchuria and parts of the Russian Far East and was called the &quot;Prosperous Country in the East&quot;.

Late Silla was a wealthy country, and its metropolitan capital of Gyeongju grew to become the fourth largest city in the world. It experienced a golden age of art and culture, exemplified by monuments such as Hwangnyongsa, Seokguram, and the Emille Bell. It also carried on the maritime legacy and prowess of Baekje, and during the 8th and 9th centuries dominated the seas of East Asia and the trade between China, Korea, and Japan, most notably during the time of Jang Bogo. In addition, Silla people made overseas communities in China on the Shandong Peninsula and the mouth of the Yangtze River. However, Silla was later weakened due to internal strife and the revival of successor states Baekje and Goguryeo, which culminated into the Later Three Kingdoms period in the late 9th century.

Buddhism flourished during this time. Many Korean Buddhists gained great fame among Chinese Buddhist circles and greatly contributed to Chinese Buddhism. Examples of significant Korean Buddhists from this period include Woncheuk, Wonhyo, Uisang, Musang, and Kim Gyo-gak. Kim was a Silla prince whose influence made Mount Jiuhua one of the Four Sacred Mountains of Chinese Buddhism.

=== Unified dynasties ===
In 936, the Later Three Kingdoms were united by Wang Geon, who established Goryeo as the successor state of Goguryeo. Balhae had fallen to the Khitan Empire in 926, and a decade later the last crown prince of Balhae fled south to Goryeo, where he was warmly welcomed and included in the ruling family by Wang Geon, thus unifying the two successor nations of Goguryeo. Like Silla, Goryeo was a highly cultural state, and invented the metal movable type printing press. After defeating the Khitan Empire, which was the most powerful empire of its time, in the Goryeo–Khitan War, Goryeo experienced a golden age that lasted a century, during which the Tripitaka Koreana was completed and significant developments in printing and publishing occurred. This promoted education and the dispersion of knowledge on philosophy, literature, religion, and science. By 1100, there were 12 universities that produced notable scholars.

However, the Mongol invasions in the 13th century greatly weakened the kingdom. Goryeo was never conquered by the Mongols, but exhausted after three decades of fighting, the Korean court sent its crown prince to the Yuan capital to swear allegiance to Kublai Khan, who accepted and married one of his daughters to the Korean crown prince. Henceforth, Goryeo continued to rule Korea, though as a tributary ally to the Mongols for the next 86 years. During this period, the two nations became intertwined as all subsequent Korean kings married Mongol princesses, and the last empress of the Yuan dynasty was a Korean princess. In the mid-14th century, Goryeo drove out the Mongols to regain its northern territories, briefly conquered Liaoyang, and defeated invasions by the Red Turbans. However, in 1392, General Yi Seong-gye, who had been ordered to attack China, turned his army around and staged a coup.

Yi Seong-gye declared the new name of Korea as &quot;Joseon&quot; in reference to Gojoseon, and moved the capital to Hanseong (one of the old names of Seoul). The first 200 years of the Joseon dynasty were marked by peace and saw great advancements in science and education, as well as the creation of Hangul by Sejong the Great to promote literacy among the common people. The prevailing ideology of the time was Neo-Confucianism, which was epitomized by the seonbi class: nobles who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity. Between 1592 and 1598, Japan under Toyotomi Hideyoshi launched invasions of Korea, but the advance was halted by Korean forces (most notably the Joseon Navy led by Admiral Yi Sun-sin and his renowned &quot;turtle ship&quot;) with assistance from righteous army militias formed by Korean civilians, and Ming dynasty Chinese troops. Through a series of successful battles of attrition, the Japanese forces were eventually forced to withdraw, and relations between all parties became normalized. However, the Manchus took advantage of Joseon&#x27;s war-weakened state and invaded in 1627 and 1637 and then went on to conquer the destabilized Ming dynasty. After normalizing relations with the new Qing dynasty, Joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace. Kings Yeongjo and Jeongjo particularly led a new renaissance of the Joseon dynasty during the 18th century.

In the 19th century, Joseon began experiencing economic difficulties and widespread uprisings, including the Donghak Peasant Revolution. The royal in-law families had gained control of the government, leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state. In addition, the strict isolationism of the Joseon government that earned it &quot;the hermit kingdom&quot; became increasing ineffective due to increasing encroachment from powers such as Japan, Russia, and the United States. This is exemplified by the Joseon–United States Treaty of 1882, in which it was compelled to open its borders.

=== Japanese occupation and World War II ===

In the late 19th century, Japan became a significant regional power after winning the First Sino-Japanese War against Qing China and the Russo-Japanese War against the Russian Empire. In 1897, King Gojong, the last king of Korea, proclaimed Joseon as the Korean Empire. However, Japan compelled Korea to become its protectorate in 1905 and formally annexed it in 1910. What followed was a period of forced assimilation, in which Korean language, culture, and history were suppressed. This led to the March First Movement protests in 1919 and the subsequent foundation of resistance groups in exile, primarily in China. Among the resistance groups was Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea.

Towards the end of World War II, the U.S. proposed dividing the Korean peninsula into two occupation zones: a U.S. zone and a Soviet zone. Dean Rusk and Charles H. Bonesteel III suggested the 38th parallel as the dividing line, as it placed Seoul under U.S. control. To the surprise of Rusk and Bonesteel, the Soviets accepted their proposal and agreed to divide Korea.

=== Modern history ===


Despite intentions to liberate a unified peninsula in the 1943 Cairo Declaration, escalating tensions between the Soviet Union and the United States led to the division of Korea into two political entities in 1948: North Korea and South Korea.

In the South, the United States appointed and supported the former head of the Korean Provisional Government Syngman Rhee as leader. Rhee won the first presidential elections of the newly declared Republic of Korea in May 1948. In the North, the Soviets backed a former anti-Japanese guerrilla and communist activist, Kim Il Sung, who was appointed premier of the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea in September.

In October, the Soviet Union declared Kim Il Sung&#x27;s government as sovereign over both the north and south. The UN declared Rhee&#x27;s government as &quot;a lawful government having effective control and jurisdiction over that part of Korea where the UN Temporary Commission on Korea was able to observe and consult&quot; and the government &quot;based on elections which was observed by the Temporary Commission&quot; in addition to a statement that &quot;this is the only such government in Korea.&quot; Both leaders engaged in authoritarian repression of political opponents. South Korea requested military support from the United States but was denied, and North Korea&#x27;s military was heavily reinforced by the Soviet Union.

==== Korean War ====
On June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, sparking the Korean War, the Cold War&#x27;s first major conflict, which continued until 1953. At the time, the Soviet Union had boycotted the UN, thus forfeiting their veto rights. This allowed the UN to intervene in a civil war when it became apparent that the superior North Korean forces would unify the entire country. The Soviet Union and China backed North Korea, with the later participation of millions of Chinese troops. After an ebb and flow that saw both sides facing defeat with massive losses among Korean civilians in both the north and the south, the war eventually reached a stalemate. During the war, Rhee&#x27;s party promoted the One-People Principle, an effort to build an obedient citizenry through ethnic homogeneity and authoritarian appeals to nationalism.

The 1953 armistice, never signed by South Korea, split the peninsula along the demilitarized zone near the original demarcation line. No peace treaty was ever signed, resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war. Approximately 3 million people died in the Korean War, with a higher proportional civilian death toll than World War II or the Vietnam War, making it one of the deadliest conflicts of the Cold War era. In addition, virtually all of Korea&#x27;s major cities were destroyed by the war.

==== Post-Korean War (1960–1990) ====
In 1960, a student uprising (the &quot;April Revolution&quot;) led to the resignation of the autocratic President Syngman Rhee. This was followed by 13 months of political instability as South Korea was led by a weak and ineffectual government. This instability was broken by the May 16, 1961, coup led by General Park Chung Hee. As president, Park oversaw a period of rapid export-led economic growth enforced by political repression. Under Park, South Korea took an active role in the Vietnam War.

Park was heavily criticized as a ruthless military dictator, who in 1972 extended his rule by creating a new constitution, which gave the president sweeping (almost dictatorial) powers and permitted him to run for an unlimited number of six-year terms. The Korean economy developed significantly during Park&#x27;s tenure. The government developed the nationwide expressway system, the Seoul subway system, and laid the foundation for economic development during his 17-year tenure, which ended with his assassination in 1979.

The years after Park&#x27;s assassination were marked again by political turmoil, as the previously suppressed opposition leaders all campaigned to run for president in the sudden political void. In 1979, General Chun Doo-hwan led the coup d&#x27;état of December Twelfth. Following the coup d&#x27;état, Chun planned to rise to power through several measures. On May 17, Chun forced the Cabinet to expand martial law to the whole nation, which had previously not applied to Jeju Island. The expanded martial law closed universities, banned political activities, and further curtailed the press. Chun&#x27;s assumption of the presidency through the events of May 17 triggered nationwide protests demanding democracy; these protests were particularly focused in Gwangju, to which Chun sent special forces to violently suppress the Gwangju Democratization Movement.

Chun subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee and took the presidency according to his political plan. Chun and his government held South Korea under a despotic rule until 1987, when a Seoul National University student, Park Jong-chul, was tortured to death. On , the Catholic Priests Association for Justice revealed the incident, igniting the June Democratic Struggle across the country. Eventually, Chun&#x27;s party, the Democratic Justice Party, and its leader, Roh Tae-woo, announced the June 29 Declaration, which included the direct election of the president. Roh went on to win the election by a narrow margin against the two main opposition leaders, Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam. Seoul hosted the Olympic Games in 1988, widely regarded as successful and a significant boost for South Korea&#x27;s global image and economy.

South Korea was formally invited to become a member of the United Nations in 1991. The transition of Korea from autocracy to modern democracy was marked in 1997 by the election of Kim Dae-jung, who was sworn in as the eighth president of South Korea on February 25, 1998. His election was significant given that he had in earlier years been a political prisoner sentenced to death (later commuted to exile). He won against the backdrop of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, where he took IMF advice to restructure the economy and the nation soon recovered its economic growth, albeit at a slower pace.

==== Contemporary history ====

In June 2000, as part of President Kim Dae-jung&#x27;s &quot;Sunshine Policy&quot; of engagement, a North–South summit took place in Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea. Later that year, Kim received the Nobel Peace Prize &quot;for his work for democracy and human rights in South Korea and in East Asia in general, and for peace and reconciliation with North Korea in particular&quot;. However, because of discontent among the population for fruitless approaches to the North under the previous administrations and, amid North Korean provocations, a conservative government was elected in 2007 led by President Lee Myung-bak, former mayor of Seoul. Meanwhile, South Korea and Japan jointly co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup. However, South Korean and Japanese relations later soured because of conflicting claims of sovereignty over the Liancourt Rocks.

In 2010, there was an escalation in attacks by North Korea. In March 2010 the South Korean warship ROKS &quot;Cheonan&quot; was sunk killing 46 South Korean sailors, allegedly by a North Korean submarine. In November 2010 Yeonpyeongdo was attacked by a significant North Korean artillery barrage, with 4 people dying. The lack of a strong response to these attacks from both South Korea and the international community (the official UN report declined to explicitly name North Korea as the perpetrator for the &quot;Cheonan&quot; sinking) caused significant anger with the South Korean public.

South Korea saw another milestone in 2012 with the first ever female President Park Geun-hye elected and assuming office. The daughter of former President Park Chung Hee, she carried on a conservative brand of politics. President Park Geun-hye&#x27;s administration was formally accused of corruption, bribery, and influence-peddling for the involvement of close friend Choi Soon-sil in state affairs. There followed a series of massive public demonstrations from November 2016, and she was removed from office. After the fallout of Park&#x27;s impeachment and dismissal, elections were held and Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party won the presidency, assuming office on May 10, 2017. His tenure saw an improving political relationship with North Korea, some increasing divergence in the military alliance with the United States, and the successful hosting of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. In April 2018, Park Geun-hye was sentenced to 24 years in jail because of abuse of power and corruption. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the nation since 2020. That same year, South Korea recorded more deaths than births, resulting in a population decline for the first time on record.

In March 2022, Yoon Suk Yeol, the candidate of conservative opposition People Power Party, won a close election over the Democratic Party candidate by the narrowest margin ever. Yoon was sworn in on May 10, 2022. He declared martial law on December 3, 2024, accusing the opposition of being pro-North Korean and conducting anti-state activities. After several hours, the National Assembly voted to nullify the declaration in a unanimous vote of 190/0, causing Yoon to end martial law early on December 4. Yoon&#x27;s actions resulted in his impeachment on December 14, 2024.

== Geography ==
South Korea occupies the southern portion of the Korean Peninsula, which extends some from the Continental and East Asian mainland. This mountainous peninsula is flanked by the Yellow Sea to the west and the Sea of Japan to the east. Its southern tip lies on the Korea Strait and the East China Sea. The country, including all its islands, lies between latitudes 33° and 39°N, and longitudes 124° and 130°E. Its total area is .

South Korea can be divided into four general regions: an eastern region of high mountain ranges and narrow coastal plains; a western region of broad coastal plains, river basins, and rolling hills; a southwestern region of mountains and valleys; and a southeastern region dominated by the broad basin of the Nakdong River. South Korea is home to three terrestrial ecoregions: Central Korean deciduous forests, Manchurian mixed forests, and Southern Korea evergreen forests. South Korea&#x27;s terrain is mostly mountainous, most of which is not arable. Lowlands, located primarily in the west and southeast, make up only 30% of the total land area. South Korea has 20 national parks and popular nature places like the Boseong Tea Fields, Suncheon Bay Ecological Park, and Jirisan.

About 3,000 islands, mostly small and uninhabited, lie off the western and southern coasts of South Korea. Jeju Province is about off the southern coast of South Korea. It is the country&#x27;s largest island, with an area of . Jeju is also the site of South Korea&#x27;s highest point: Hallasan, an extinct volcano, reaches above sea level. The easternmost islands of South Korea include Ulleungdo and Liancourt Rocks (Dokdo/Takeshima), while Marado and Socotra Rock are the southernmost islands of South Korea.

=== Climate ===
South Korea tends to have a humid continental climate and a humid subtropical climate, and is affected by the East Asian monsoon, with precipitation heavier in summer during a short rainy season called &quot;jangma&quot;, which begins end of June and lasts through the end of July. In Seoul, the average January temperature range is , and the average August temperature range is . Winter temperatures are higher along the southern coast and considerably lower in the mountainous interior. Summer can be uncomfortably hot and humid, with temperatures exceeding in most parts of the country. South Korea has four distinct seasons; spring, summer, autumn and winter. Spring usually lasts from late March to early May, summer from mid-May to early September, autumn from mid-September to early November, and winter from mid-November to mid-March.

Rainfall is concentrated in the summer months of June through September. The southern coast is subject to late summer typhoons that bring strong winds, heavy rains and sometimes floods. The average annual precipitation varies from in Seoul to in Busan.

=== Environment ===

During the first 20 years of South Korea&#x27;s growth surge, little effort was made to preserve the environment. Unchecked industrialization and urban development have resulted in deforestation and the ongoing destruction of wetlands such as the Songdo Tidal Flat. However, there have been recent efforts to balance these problems, including a government run five-year green growth project that aims to boost energy efficiency and green technology.

The green-based economic strategy is a comprehensive overhaul of South Korea&#x27;s economy, utilizing nearly two percent of the national GDP. The greening initiative includes such efforts as a nationwide bike network, solar and wind energy, lowering oil dependent vehicles, backing daylight saving time and extensive usage of environmentally friendly technologies such as LEDs in electronics and lighting. The country—one of the world&#x27;s most wired—plans to build a nationwide next-generation network that will be 10 times faster than broadband facilities, in order to reduce energy usage.

The renewable portfolio standard program with renewable energy certificates runs from 2012 to 2022.
Quota systems favor large, vertically integrated generators and multinational electric utilities, if only because certificates are generally denominated in units of one megawatt-hour. They are also more difficult to design and implement than a feed-in tariff. Around 350 residential micro combined heat and power units were installed in 2012. In 2017, South Korea was the world&#x27;s seventh largest emitter of carbon emissions and the fifth largest emitter per capita. President Moon Jae-in pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero in 2050.

Seoul&#x27;s tap water recently became safe to drink, with city officials branding it &quot;Arisu&quot; in a bid to convince the public. Efforts have also been made with afforestation projects. Another multibillion-dollar project was the restoration of Cheonggyecheon, a stream running through downtown Seoul that had earlier been paved over by a motorway. One major challenge is air quality, with acid rain, sulfur oxides, and annual yellow dust storms being particular problems. It is acknowledged that many of these difficulties are a result of South Korea&#x27;s proximity to China, which is a major air polluter. South Korea had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.02/10, ranking it 87th globally out of 172 countries.

South Korea is a member of the Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity Treaty, Kyoto Protocol (forming the Environmental Integrity Group (EIG), regarding UNFCCC, with Mexico and Switzerland), Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (not into force), Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, and Whaling.

== Government and politics ==
The South Korean government&#x27;s structure is determined by the Constitution of the Republic of Korea. Like many democratic states, South Korea has a government divided into three branches: executive, judicial, and legislative. The executive and legislative branches operate primarily at the national level, although various ministries in the executive branch also carry out local functions. The judicial branch operates at both the national and local levels. Local governments are semi-autonomous and contain executive and legislative bodies of their own. South Korea is a constitutional democracy.
The constitution has been revised several times since its first promulgation in 1948 at independence. However, it has retained many broad characteristics and with the exception of the short-lived Second Republic of Korea, the country has always had a presidential system with an independent chief executive. Under its current constitution the state is sometimes referred to as the Sixth Republic of Korea. The first direct election was also held in 1948.

Although South Korea experienced a series of military dictatorships from the 1960s until the 1980s, it has since developed into a successful liberal democracy. Today, the CIA World Factbook describes South Korea&#x27;s democracy as a &quot;fully functioning modern democracy&quot;, while &quot;The Economist Democracy Index&quot; classifies it as a &quot;full democracy&quot;, ranking at 24th out of 167 countries in 2022. According to the V-Dem Democracy indices South Korea is the 3rd most electoral democratic country in Asia as of 2023. However, some political experts has argued that South Korea has been experiencing democratic backsliding and the reemergence of authoritarianism, particularly under the presidency of Yoon Suk Yeol, which culminated when he declared martial law for the first time since the 1980 military coup d&#x27;état after the assassination of dictator Park Chung Hee, and the first since democratization in 1987. South Korea is ranked 33rd on the Corruption Perceptions Index (6th in the Asia–Pacific region), with a score of 63 out of 100.

=== Administrative divisions ===

The major administrative divisions in South Korea are eleven provinces, three special self-governing provinces, six metropolitan cities (self-governing cities that are not part of any province), one special metropolitan city and one special self-governing city.

=== Foreign relations ===
South Korea has been a member of the United Nations since 1991, when it became a member state at the same time as North Korea. On January 1, 2007, former South Korean Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon served as UN Secretary-General from 2007 to 2016. South Korea has developed links with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations as both a member of &quot;ASEAN Plus three&quot;, a body of observers, and the East Asia Summit (EAS). In November 2009, South Korea joined the OECD Development Assistance Committee, marking the first time a former aid recipient country joined the group as a donor member. South Korea hosted the G-20 Summit in Seoul in November 2010, a year that saw South Korea and the European Union conclude a free trade agreement (FTA) to reduce trade barriers. South Korea went on to sign a Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Australia in 2014, and another with New Zealand in 2015. South Korea and Britain have agreed to extend a period of low or zero tariffs on bilateral trade of products with parts from the European Union in October 2023.

==== North Korea ====
Both North and South Korea claim complete sovereignty over the entire peninsula and outlying islands. Despite mutual animosity, reconciliation efforts have continued since the initial separation between North and South Korea. Political figures such as Kim Ku worked to reconcile the two governments even after the Korean War. With longstanding animosity following the Korean War from 1950 to 1953, North Korea and South Korea signed an agreement to pursue peace. On October 4, 2007, Roh Moo-Hyun and North Korean leader Kim Jong Il signed an eight-point agreement on issues of permanent peace, high-level talks, economic cooperation, renewal of train services, highway and air travel, and a joint Olympic cheering squad.

Despite the Sunshine Policy and efforts at reconciliation, the progress was complicated by North Korean missile tests in 1993, 1998, 2006, 2009, and 2013. By early 2009, relationships between North and South Korea were very tense; North Korea had been reported to have deployed missiles, ended its former agreements with South Korea, and threatened South Korea and the United States not to interfere with a satellite launch it had planned. North and South Korea are still technically at war (having never signed a peace treaty after the Korean War) and share the world&#x27;s most heavily fortified border.

==== China and Russia ====

Historically, Korea had close relations with the dynasties in China, and some Korean kingdoms were members of the Imperial Chinese tributary system. The Korean kingdoms also ruled over some Chinese kingdoms including the Khitan people and the Manchurians before the Qing dynasty and received tributes from them. In modern times, before the formation of South Korea, Korean independence fighters worked with Chinese soldiers during the Japanese occupation. However, after World War II, the People&#x27;s Republic of China embraced Maoism while South Korea sought close relations with the United States. The PRC assisted North Korea with manpower and supplies during the Korean War, and in its aftermath the diplomatic relationship between South Korea and the PRC almost completely ceased. Relations thawed gradually, and South Korea and the PRC re-established formal diplomatic relations on August 24, 1992. The two countries sought to improve bilateral relations and lifted the forty-year-old trade embargo, and South Korean–Chinese relations have improved steadily since 1992. The Republic of Korea broke off official relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) upon gaining official relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China, which does not recognize Taiwan&#x27;s sovereignty. China has become South Korea&#x27;s largest trading partner by far, sending 26% of South Korean exports in 2016 worth $124 billion, as well as an additional $32 billion worth of exports to Hong Kong. South Korea is also China&#x27;s fourth largest trading partner, with $93 billion of Chinese imports in 2016.

Following the Korean War, the Soviet Union&#x27;s relation with North Korea resulted in little contact until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Since the 1990s, there has been greater trade and cooperation between the two nations.

==== Japan ====


Korea and Japan have had difficult relations since ancient times but also significant cultural exchange, with Korea acting as the gateway between East Asia and Japan. Contemporary perceptions of Japan are still largely defined by Japan&#x27;s 35-year colonization of Korea in the 20th century, which is generally regarded in South Korea as having been very negative. There were no formal diplomatic ties between South Korea and Japan directly after independence at the end of World War II in 1945. South Korea and Japan eventually signed the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea in 1965 to establish diplomatic ties. Japan is today South Korea&#x27;s third largest trading partner, with 12% ($46 billion) of exports in 2016.

Longstanding issues such as Japanese war crimes against Korean civilians, the negationist re-writing of Japanese textbooks relating Japanese atrocities during World War II, the territorial disputes over the Liancourt Rocks, known in South Korea as &quot;Dokdo&quot; and in Japan as &quot;Takeshima&quot;, and visits by Japanese politicians to the Yasukuni Shrine, honoring Japanese people (civilians and military) killed during the war continue to trouble Korean-Japanese relations. The Liancourt Rocks were the first Korean territories to be forcibly colonized by Japan in 1905. Although it was again returned to Korea along with the rest of its territory in 1951 with the signing of the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan does not recant on its claims that the Liancourt Rocks are Japanese territory. In 2009, in response to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi&#x27;s visits to the Yasukuni Shrine, President Roh Moo-hyun suspended all summit talks between South Korea and Japan in 2009. A summit between the nations&#x27; leaders was eventually held on February 9, 2018, during the Korean held Winter Olympics. South Korea asked the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to ban the Japanese Rising Sun Flag from the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, and the IOC said in a statement &quot;sports stadiums should be free of any political demonstration. When concerns arise at games time we look at them on a case-by-case basis.&quot;

==== European Union ====

The European Union (EU) and South Korea are important trading partners, having negotiated a free trade agreement for many years since South Korea was designated as a priority FTA partner in 2006. The free trade agreement was approved in September 2010, and took effect on July 1, 2011. South Korea is the EU&#x27;s tenth largest trade partner, and the EU has become South Korea&#x27;s fourth largest export destination. EU trade with South Korea exceeded €90 billion in 2015 and has enjoyed an annual average growth rate of 9.8% between 2003 and 2013.

The EU has been the single largest foreign investor in South Korea since 1962, and accounted for almost 45% of all FDI inflows into Korea in 2006. Nevertheless, EU companies have significant problems accessing and operating in the South Korean market because of stringent standards and testing requirements for products and services often creating barriers to trade. Both in its regular bilateral contacts with South Korea and through its FTA with Korea, the EU is seeking to improve the current geopolitical situation.

==== United States ====

A close relationship with the United States began directly after World War II, when the United States temporarily administered Korea for three years (mainly in the South, with the Soviet Union engaged in North Korea). Upon the onset of the Korean War in 1950, U.S. forces were sent to defend against an invasion from North Korea of the South and subsequently fought as the largest contributor of UN troops. The United States participation was critical for preventing the near defeat of the Republic of Korea by northern forces, as well as fighting back for the territory gains that define the South Korean nation today.

Following the Armistice, South Korea and the U.S. agreed to a &quot;Mutual Defense Treaty&quot;, under which an attack on either party in the Pacific area would summon a response from both. In 1967, South Korea obliged the mutual defense treaty by sending a large combat troop contingent to support the United States in the Vietnam War. The two nations have strong economic, diplomatic, and military ties, although they have at times disagreed with regard to policies towards North Korea and with regard to some of South Korea&#x27;s industrial activities that involve usage of rocket or nuclear technology. There had also been strong anti-American sentiment during certain periods, which has largely moderated in the modern day.

The two nations also share a close economic relationship, with the U.S. being South Korea&#x27;s second largest trading partner, receiving $66 billion in exports in 2016. In 2007, a free trade agreement known as the Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement was signed between South Korea and the United States, but its formal implementation was repeatedly delayed, pending approval by the legislative bodies of the two countries. On October 12, 2011, the U.S. Congress passed the long-stalled trade agreement with South Korea. It went into effect on March 15, 2012.

=== Military ===
Unresolved tension with North Korea has prompted South Korea to allocate 2.6% of its GDP and 13.2% of all government spending to its military (government share of GDP: 14.967%), while maintaining compulsory conscription for men. Consequently, the ROK Armed Forces is one of the largest and most powerful standing armed forces in the world with a reported personnel strength of 3,600,000 in 2022 (500,000 active and 3,100,000 reserve).

The South Korean military consists of the Army (ROKA), the Navy (ROKN), the Air Force (ROKAF), and the Marine Corps (ROKMC), and reserve forces. Many of these forces are concentrated near the Korean Demilitarized Zone. All South Korean males are constitutionally required to serve in the military, typically 18 months. In addition Korean Augmentation to the United States Army is a branch of the Republic of Korea Army that consists of Korean enlisted personnel who are augmented to the Eighth United States Army. In 2010, South Korea spent ₩1.68 trillion in a cost-sharing agreement with the U.S. to provide budgetary support to the U.S. forces in Korea, on top of the ₩29.6 trillion budget for its own military.

From time to time, South Korea has sent its troops overseas to assist American forces. It has participated in most major conflicts that the United States has been involved in the past 50 years. South Korea dispatched 325,517 troops to fight in the Vietnam War, with a peak strength of 50,000. In 2004, South Korea sent 3,300 troops of the Zaytun Division to help rebuilding in northern Iraq, and was the third largest contributor in the coalition forces after the U.S. and Britain. Beginning in 2001, South Korea had deployed 24,000 troops in the Middle East region to support the war on terror.
The right to conscientious objection was not recognized in South Korea until recently. Over 400 men were typically imprisoned at any given time for refusing military service for political or religious reasons in the years before right to conscientious objection was established. On June 28, 2018, the South Korean Constitutional Court ruled the Military Service Act unconstitutional and ordered the government to accommodate civilian forms of military service for conscientious objectors. On November 1, 2018, the South Korean Supreme Court legalized conscientious objection as a basis for rejecting compulsory military service.

==== United States contingent ====
There is a substantial United States military presence in South Korea. There are approximately 28,500 U.S. military personnel stationed in South Korea, most of them serving one year unaccompanied tours. The U.S. troops, which are primarily ground and air units, are assigned to United States Forces Korea and mainly assigned to the Eighth Army, Seventh Air Force, and Naval Forces Korea. They are stationed in installations at Osan, Kunsan, Yongsan, Dongducheon, Sungbuk, Camp Humphreys, and Daegu, as well as at Camp Bonifas in the DMZ Joint Security Area.

A fully functioning UN Command is at the top of the chain of command of all forces in South Korea, including the U.S. forces and the entire South Korean military – if a sudden escalation of war between North and South Korea were to occur the United States would assume control of the South Korean armed forces in all military and paramilitary moves. There has been long-term agreement between the United States and South Korea that South Korea should eventually assume the lead for its own defense. This transition to a South Korean command has been slow and often postponed, although it is currently scheduled to occur in the 2020s.

== Economy ==

South Korea&#x27;s mixed economy is the 12th largest by nominal GDP and the 14th largest GDP by purchasing power parity in the world, identifying it as one of the G20 major economies. It is a developed country with a high-income economy and is the most industrialized member country of the OECD. South Korean brands such as LG Electronics and Samsung are internationally famous and garnered South Korea&#x27;s reputation for its quality electronics and other manufactured goods. South Korea became a member of the OECD in 1996.

Its massive investment in education has taken the country from mass illiteracy to a major international technological powerhouse. The country&#x27;s national economy benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most educated countries in the world with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree. South Korea&#x27;s economy was one of the world&#x27;s fastest-growing from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, and was still one of the fastest-growing developed countries in the 2000s, along with Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, the other three Asian Tigers. It recorded the fastest rise in average GDP per capita in the world between 1980 and 1990. South Koreans refer to this growth as the Miracle on the Han River. The South Korean economy is heavily dependent on international trade, and in 2014, South Korea was the fifth-largest exporter and seventh-largest importer in the world. In addition, the country has one of the world&#x27;s largest foreign-exchange reserves.

Despite the economy&#x27;s high growth potential and apparent structural stability, the country suffers damage to its credit rating in the stock market because of the belligerence of North Korea in times of deep military crises, which has an adverse effect on its financial markets. The International Monetary Fund compliments the resilience of the economy against various economic crises, citing low state debt and high fiscal reserves that can quickly be mobilized to address financial emergencies. Although it was severely harmed by the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the country managed a rapid recovery and subsequently tripled its GDP.

Furthermore, South Korea was one of the few developed countries that was able to avoid a recession during the global financial crisis of 2007–08. Its economic growth rate reached 6.2% in 2010 (the fastest growth for eight years after significant growth by 7.2% in 2002), a sharp recovery from economic growth rates of 2.3% in 2008 and 0.2% in 2009 during the Great Recession. The unemployment rate also remained low in 2009 at 3.6%.

=== Transportation ===

South Korea has a technologically advanced transport network consisting of high-speed railways, highways, bus routes, ferry services, and air routes that crisscross the country. Korea Expressway Corporation operates the toll highways and service amenities en route. Korail provides train services to all major South Korean cities. Two rail lines, Gyeongui and Donghae Bukbu Line, to North Korea are being reconnected. The Korean high-speed rail system, KTX, provides high-speed service along Gyeongbu and Honam Line. Major cities have urban rapid transit systems. Express bus terminals are available in most cities.

The main gateway and largest airport is Incheon International Airport, serving passengers in 2016. Other international airports include Gimpo, Busan and Jeju. There are also many airports that were built as part of the infrastructure boom but are barely used. There are also many heliports. The national carrier Korean Air served over 26 million passengers, including almost 19 million international passengers in 2016. A second carrier, Asiana Airlines also serves domestic and international traffic. Combined, South Korean airlines serve 297 international routes. Smaller airlines, such as Jeju Air, provide domestic service with lower fares.

=== Energy ===
South Korea is the world&#x27;s fifth-largest nuclear power producer and the third-largest in Asia . Supplying 45% of its electricity production, nuclear research is very active with investigation into a variety of advanced reactors, including a small modular reactor, a liquid-metal fast/transmutation reactor and a high-temperature hydrogen generation design. Fuel production and waste handling technologies have also been developed locally. It is also a member of the ITER project.

South Korea is an emerging exporter of nuclear reactors, having concluded agreements with the United Arab Emirates to build and maintain four advanced nuclear reactors, with Jordan for a research nuclear reactor, and with Argentina for construction and repair of heavy-water nuclear reactors. , South Korea and Turkey are in negotiations regarding construction of two nuclear reactors. South Korea is also preparing to bid on construction of a light-water nuclear reactor for Argentina.

South Korea is not allowed to enrich uranium or develop traditional uranium enrichment technology on its own, because of U.S. political pressure, unlike most major nuclear powers such as Japan, Germany, and France, competitors in the international nuclear market. This impediment to South Korea&#x27;s indigenous nuclear industrial undertaking has sparked occasional diplomatic rows between the two allies. While successful in exporting its electricity-generating nuclear technology and nuclear reactors, it cannot capitalize on the market for nuclear enrichment facilities and refineries, preventing it from further expanding its export niche. South Korea has sought unique technologies such as pyroprocessing to circumvent these obstacles and seek a more advantageous competition. The U.S. has recently been wary of the burgeoning nuclear program, which South Korea insists will be for civilian use only.

South Korea is the 2nd highest ranked Continental Asian country in the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Networked Readiness Index after Singapore—an indicator for determining the development level of a country&#x27;s information and communication technologies. South Korea ranks 9th worldwide.

=== Tourism ===
In 2019, more than 17 million foreign tourists visited South Korea. South Korean tourism is driven by many factors, including the prominence of Korean pop culture such as South Korean pop music and television dramas, known as the Korean Wave or &quot;Hallyu&quot;, has gained popularity throughout East Asia. The Hyundai Research Institute reported that the Korean Wave has a direct influence on encouraging direct foreign investment back into the country through demand for products, and the tourism industry. Among East Asian countries, China was the most receptive, investing $1.4 billion in South Korea, with much of the investment within its service sector, a sevenfold increase from 2001.

According to an analysis by economist Han Sang-Wan, a 1% increase in the exports of Korean cultural content pushes consumer goods exports up 0.083%, while a 1% increase in Korean pop content exports to a country produces a 0.019% bump in tourism.

=== National pension scheme ===
The South Korean pension system was created to provide benefits to persons reaching old age, families and persons stricken with death of their primary breadwinner, and for the purposes of stabilizing the nation&#x27;s welfare state. The structure is primarily based on taxation and is income-related. The system is divided into four categories distributing benefits to participants through national, military personnel, governmental, and private school teacher pension schemes. The national pension scheme is the primary welfare system providing allowances to the majority of persons. Eligibility for the national pension scheme is not dependent on income but on age and residence, where those between the ages of 18 and 59 are covered. Anyone under 18 is a dependent of someone who is covered or under a special exclusion where they are allowed to alternative provisions. The national pension scheme is divided into four categories of insured persons – the workplace-based insured, the individually insured, the voluntarily insured, and the voluntarily and continuously insured. An old-age pension scheme covers individuals age 60 or older for the rest of their life as long as they have satisfied the minimum of 20 years of national pension coverage beforehand.

=== Science and technology ===


Scientific and technological development in South Korea at first did not occur largely because of more pressing matters such as the division of Korea and the Korean War that occurred right after its independence. It was not until the 1960s under the dictatorship of Park Chung Hee when South Korea&#x27;s economy rapidly grew from industrialization and the chaebol corporations such as Samsung, LG, and SK. Ever since the industrialization of South Korea&#x27;s economy, South Korea has placed its focus on technology-based corporations, which has been supported by infrastructure developments by the government.

South Korea leads the OECD in graduates in science and engineering. From 2014 to 2019, the country ranked first among the most innovative countries in the Bloomberg Innovation Index. It was ranked 6th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024. Republic of Korea South Korea today is known as a launchpad of a mature mobile market that allows developers to reap benefits of a market where very few technology constraints exist. There is a growing trend of inventions of new types of media or apps, utilizing the 4G and 5G internet infrastructure in South Korea. South Korea has the infrastructures to meet a high density of population and culture; this, along with high revenues, allows South Korean-only tech startups to reach valuations of $1 billion and above, a peak usually reserved for startups growing in several countries.

Total spending for research and development grew from about 3.9% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013 to more than 4.9% in 2022 and was thus the second-highest in the world, only behind Israel which spent 5.9%. In 2023 the government announced a spending cut by about 11% for 2024 and the intention to shift resources to new initiatives, such as efforts to build rockets, pursue biomedical research, and develop US-style biotech innovation.

==== Cyber security ====

Following cyberattacks in the first half of 2013, whereby government, news-media, television station, and bank websites were compromised, the national government committed to the training of 5,000 new cybersecurity experts by 2017. The South Korean government blamed North Korea for these attacks, as well as incidents that occurred in 2009, 2011 and 2012, but Pyongyang denies the accusations. South Korea&#x27;s government maintains a broad-ranging approach toward the regulation of specific online content and imposes a substantial level of censorship on election-related discourse and on many websites that the government deems subversive or socially harmful.

==== Aerospace engineering ====
South Korea has sent up 10 satellites since 1992, all using foreign rockets and overseas launch pads, notably Arirang-1 in 1999, and Arirang-2 in 2006 as part of its space partnership with Russia. Arirang-1 was lost in space in 2008, after nine years in service. In April 2008, Yi So-yeon became the first Korean to fly in space, aboard the Russian Soyuz TMA-12.

In June 2009, the first spaceport of South Korea, Naro Space Center, was completed at Goheung, South Jeolla Province. The launch of Naro-1 in January 2013 was a success, after two previous failed attempts.

Efforts to build an indigenous space launch vehicle have been marred by persistent political pressure from the United States, who had for many decades hindered South Korea&#x27;s indigenous rocket and missile development programs in fear of their possible connection to clandestine military ballistic missile programs, which Korea many times insisted did not violate the research and development guidelines stipulated by US-Korea agreements on restriction of rocket technology research and development. South Korea has sought the assistance of foreign countries such as Russia through MTCR commitments to supplement its restricted domestic rocket technology. The two failed KSLV-I launch vehicles were based on the Universal Rocket Module, the first stage of the Russian Angara rocket, combined with a solid-fueled second stage built by South Korea.

On October 21, 2021, the KSLV-2 Nuri was successfully launched, and South Korea became a country with its own space projectile technology.

==== Robotics ====

Robotics has been included in the list of main national research and development projects since 2003. In 2009, the government announced plans to build robot-themed parks in Incheon and Masan with a mix of public and private funding. In 2005, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) developed the world&#x27;s second walking humanoid robot, HUBO. A team in the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology developed the first Korean android, EveR-1 in May 2006.
EveR-1 has been succeeded by more complex models with improved movement and vision.

Plans of creating English-teaching robot assistants to compensate for the shortage of teachers were announced in February 2010, with the robots being deployed to most preschools and kindergartens by 2013. Robotics are also incorporated in the entertainment sector; the &quot;Korean Robot Game Festival&quot; has been held every year since 2004 to promote science and robot technology.

==== Biotechnology ====
Since the 1980s, the government has invested in the development of a domestic biotechnology industry. The medical sector accounts for a large part of the production, including production of hepatitis vaccines and antibiotics. Research and development in genetics and cloning has received increasing attention, with the first successful cloning of a dog, Snuppy in 2005, and the cloning of two females of an endangered species of gray wolves by the Seoul National University in 2007. The rapid growth of the industry has resulted in significant voids in regulation of ethics, as was highlighted by the scientific misconduct case involving Hwang Woo-Suk.

Since late 2020, SK Bioscience Inc. (a division of SK Group) has been producing a major proportion of the Vaxzevria vaccine (also known as COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca), under license from the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, for worldwide distribution through the COVAX facility under the WHO hospice. A recent agreement with Novavax expands its production for a second vaccine to 40 million doses in 2022, with a $450 million investment in domestic and overseas facilities.

== Demographics ==

South Korea had an estimated population of roughly 51.7 million in 2022. The population more than doubled from 21.5 million in 1955 to 50 million by 2010. However, it is expected to peak at 52 million in 2024 and decline to 36 million in 2072, owing to a rapid decline in birth rates that began in 1960. South Korea&#x27;s birth rate became the world&#x27;s lowest in 2009, at an annual rate of approximately 9 births per 1000 people. Fertility saw some modest increase afterwards, but dropped to a new global low in 2017, with fewer than 30,000 births per month for the first time since records began, and less than one child per woman in 2018. In 2020, the country recorded more deaths than births, resulting in the first population decrease since modern records began.

By 2021, the fertility rate stood at just 0.81 children per woman, well below the replacement rate of 2.1, falling to 0.78 in 2022 and 0.72 in 2023—the lowest in the world. Consequently, South Korea has seen the steepest decline in working age population among OECD nations; the proportion of people aged 65 years and over is slated to reach over 20% by 2025 and close to 45% by 2050. The low birth rate has been declared a &quot;national emergency&quot; and prompted the creation of a new ministry in May 2024 dedicated to reversing the trend and addressing issues related to aging, immigration, and the workforce. The government has also launched various incentives to help entice families to have children, including a cash allowance for newborns and greater funding of childcare and fertility treatments.

Government policy, along with a rebound in marriages delayed by COVID-19, may account for the Korean birth rate increasing in late 2024; total births in the third quarter were up 8% from the same period last year, marking the largest quarterly increase since the third quarter of 2012 and the first annual rise in total fertility since 2015. Data released in January 2025 show the number of births in November 2024 was 20,095, a 14.6% increase year-on-year, the highest growth rate since November 2010 (which recorded a 17.5% increase), and the third consecutive month of double-digit growth, following September&#x27;s 10.1% and October&#x27;s 13.4%. 

Most South Koreans live in urban areas following rapid migration from the countryside during the country&#x27;s rapid economic expansion in the 1970s through the 1990s. About half the population () is concentrated in the Seoul Metropolitan Area, making it the world&#x27;s second largest metropolitan area; other major cities include Busan (), Incheon (), Daegu (), Daejeon (), Gwangju () and Ulsan (). Population density is estimated at in 2022, more than 10 times the global average.

The population has been shaped by international migration. After World War II and the division of the Korean Peninsula, about four million people from North Korea crossed the border to South Korea. This trend of net entry reversed over the next 40 years because of emigration; large numbers of ethnic Koreans live overseas, sometimes in ethnic neighborhoods known as Koreatowns. The four largest diaspora populations are in China (2.3 million), the United States (1.8 million), Japan (850,000), and Canada (250,000).

South Korea is among the most ethnically homogeneous societies in the world, with ethnic Koreans representing approximately 96% of the total population. Precise numbers are difficult to estimate since official statistics do not record ethnicity, and many immigrants are ethnically Korean while a growing number of South Korean citizens are not. The percentage of foreign nationals has been growing rapidly since the late 1990s, with South Korea having one of the fastest-growing foreign-born populations: As of November 2023, there was an all-time high of 2.46 million foreign residents, accounting for nearly 5 percent of the total population, compared to 2016 figures of 1.4 million foreign residents (roughly 2.75 percent of the population). Much of this growth was driven by foreign workers and international students.

About 30,000 foreign born residents obtain South Korean citizenship every year since 2010; in 2023, the number of foreigners who acquired Korean nationality was 234,506, an increase of 4.8 percent from the prior year. The number of children of foreign residents born in South Korea increased by 7,809, or 2.8 percent, to 289,886. Many foreign citizens ethnic Koreans: migrants from China (PRC) are the largest foreign-born group both proportionally and numerically, accounting for 56.5% of foreign nationals, but approximately 70% of these Chinese citizens are (), PRC citizens of Korean ethnicity. In addition, about 43,000 English teachers from English-speaking countries reside temporarily in Korea.

Corresponding to its socioeconomic development, South Korea has experienced a dramatic increase in life expectancy, from 79.10 years in 2008 (which was 34th in the world), to 83.53 years in 2024—the fifth highest of any country or territory.

=== Language ===
Korean is the official language of South Korea and is classified by most linguists as a language isolate. It incorporates a significant number of loan words from Chinese. Korean uses an indigenous writing system called Hangul, created in 1446 by King Sejong, to provide a convenient alternative to the Classical Chinese Hanja characters that were difficult to learn and did not fit the Korean language well. South Korea still uses some Chinese Hanja characters in limited areas, such as print media and legal documentation.

The Korean language in South Korea has a standard dialect known as the Seoul dialect, with an additional four dialects (Chungcheong, Gangwon, Gyeongsang, and Jeolla) and one language (Jeju) in use around the country. Almost all South Korean students today learn English throughout their education.

=== Religion ===
According to the results of the Korea Research&#x27;s regular survey &#x27;Public Opinion in Public Opinion&#x27;, more than half of the South Korean population (51%) declared themselves not affiliated with any religious organizations. In a 2012 survey, 52% declared themselves &quot;religious&quot;, 31% said they were &quot;not religious&quot; and 15% identified themselves as &quot;convinced atheists&quot;. Of the people who are affiliated with a religious organization, most are Christians and Buddhists. According to the survey, 31% of the population were Christians (20% identified themselves as Protestants, 11% as Roman Catholics) and 17% were Buddhists. Other religions include Islam (130,000 Muslims, mostly migrant workers from Pakistan and Bangladesh but including some 35,000 Korean Muslims), the homegrown sect of Won Buddhism, and a variety of indigenous religions, including Cheondoism (a Confucianizing religion), Jeungsanism, Daejongism, Daesun Jinrihoe, and others. Freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution, and there is no state religion. Overall, between 2015 and 2024, there has been a slight rise in Christianity (down from 27.6% to 31%), a slow rise in Buddhism (from 15.5% to 17%), and a decline in the unaffiliated population (from 56.9% to 51%).

Christianity is South Korea&#x27;s largest organized religion, accounting for more than half of all South Korean adherents of religious organizations. There are approximately 16 million Christians in South Korea today; about two thirds of them belonging to Protestant churches, and the rest to the Catholic Church. The number of Protestants had been stagnant throughout the 1990s and the 2000s but increased to a peak level throughout the 2010s. Roman Catholics increased significantly between the 1980s and the 2000s but declined throughout the 2010s. Christianity, unlike in other East Asian countries, found fertile ground in Korea in the 18th century, and by the end of the 18th century it persuaded a large part of the population, as the declining monarchy supported it and opened the country to widespread proselytism as part of a project of Westernization. The weakness of Korean Korean shamanism, which—unlike Japanese Shinto and China&#x27;s religious system—never developed into a national religion of high status, combined with the impoverished state of Korean Buddhism, (after 500 years of suppression at the hands of the Joseon state, by the 20th century it was virtually extinct) left a free hand to Christian churches. Christianity&#x27;s similarity to native religious narratives has been studied as another factor that contributed to its success in the peninsula. The Japanese colonization of the first half of the 20th century further strengthened the identification of Christianity with Korean nationalism, as the Japanese coopted native Korean shamanism into the Nipponic Imperial Shinto that they tried to establish in the peninsula. Widespread Christianization of the Koreans took place during State Shinto, after its abolition, and then in the independent South Korea as the newly established military government supported Christianity and tried to utterly oust native shamanism.
Among Christian denominations, Presbyterianism is the largest. About nine million people belong to one of the hundred different Presbyterian churches; the biggest ones are the HapDong Presbyterian Church, TongHap Presbyterian Church and the Koshin Presbyterian Church. South Korea is also the second-largest missionary-sending nation, after the United States.

Buddhism was introduced to Korea in the 4th century. It soon became a dominant religion in the southeastern kingdom of Silla, the region that hitherto hosts the strongest concentration of Buddhists in South Korea. In the other states of the Three Kingdoms Period, Goguryeo and Baekje, it was made the state religion respectively in 372 and 528. It remained the state religion in Later Silla and Goryeo. It was later suppressed throughout much of the subsequent history under the unified kingdom of Joseon, which officially adopted a strict Korean Confucianism. Today, South Korea has about 8,7 million Buddhists, most of them affiliated to the Jogye Order. Most of the National Treasures of South Korea are Buddhist artifacts.

=== Education ===

A centralized administration in South Korea oversees the process for the education of children from kindergarten to the third and final year of high school. The school year is divided into two semesters, the first of which begins at the beginning of March and ends in mid-July, the second of which begins in late August and ends in mid-February. The country adopted a new educational program to increase the number of their foreign students through 2010. According to the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the number of scholarships for foreign students in South Korea would have (under the program) doubled by that time, and the number of foreign students would have reached 100,000.

South Korea is one of the top-performing Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences with the average student scoring 519, compared with the OECD average of 492, placing it ninth in the world. The country has one of the world&#x27;s highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries. The country is well known for its highly feverish outlook on education, where its national obsession with education has been called &quot;education fever&quot;. This obsession with education has catapulted the resource-poor nation consistently atop the global education rankings. In 2014, South Korea ranked second worldwide (after Singapore) in the national rankings of students&#x27; math and science scores by the OECD. Higher education is a serious issue in South Korean society, where it is viewed as one of the fundamental cornerstones of South Korean life. Education is regarded with a high priority for South Korean families, as success in education is often a source of honor and pride for families and within South Korean society at large, and is seen as a fundamental necessity to channel one&#x27;s social mobility to ultimately improve one&#x27;s socioeconomic position in South Korean society.

In 2015, the country spent 5.1% of its GDP on all levels of education—roughly 0.8 percentage points above the OECD average of 4.3%. A strong investment in education, a militant drive to achieve academic success, as well as the passion for scholarly excellence has helped the resource-poor country rapidly grow its economy over the past 60 years from a war-torn land to a prosperous, developed country.

=== Health ===
South Korea has a universal health care system. According to the Health Care Index ranking, it has the world&#x27;s best healthcare system as of 2021. South Korean hospitals have advanced medical equipment and facilities readily available, ranking 4th for MRI units per capita and 6th for CT scanners per capita in the OECD. It also had the OECD&#x27;s second largest number of hospital beds per 1000 people at 9.56 beds. Life expectancy has been rising rapidly and South Korea ranked 6th in the world for life expectancy at 83.5 years in 2023. It also has the third highest health adjusted life expectancy in the world. Suicide in South Korea is the 12th highest in the world according to the World Health Organization, as well as the highest suicide rate in the OECD.
== Culture ==


South Korea shares its traditional culture with North Korea, but the two Koreas have developed distinct contemporary forms of culture since the peninsula was divided in 1945. Historically, while the culture has been heavily influenced by that of neighboring China, it has nevertheless independently managed to develop a unique cultural identity in its own right that is distinct from that of its larger neighbor on the East Asian mainland. , South Korea has 24 UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritages of Humanity, along with 16 World Heritage Sites. The Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism actively encourages the traditional arts, as well as modern forms, through funding and education programs. According to the 2023 edition of the Press Freedom Index, South Korea has the second highest level of press freedom in Continental and East Asia, behind Taiwan.

Industrialization and urbanization have brought many changes to the way modern Koreans live. Changing economic circumstances and lifestyles have led to a concentration of population in major cities, especially the capital Seoul, with multi-generational households separating into nuclear family living arrangements. A 2014 Euromonitor study found that South Koreans drink the most alcohol on a weekly basis compared to the rest of the world. South Koreans drink 13.7 shots of liquor per week on average and, of the 44 other countries analyzed, Russia, the Philippines, and Thailand follow.

=== Art ===


Korean art has been highly influenced by Buddhism and Confucianism, which can be seen in the many traditional paintings, sculptures, ceramics and the performing arts. Korean pottery and porcelain, such as Joseon&#x27;s &quot;baekja&quot; and buncheong, and Goryeo&#x27;s celadon are well known throughout the world. The Korean tea ceremony, &quot;pansori&quot;, &quot;talchum,&quot; and &quot;buchaechum&quot; are also notable Korean performing arts.

Post-war modern Korean art started to flourish in the 1960s and 1970s, when South Korean artists took interest in geometrical shapes and intangible subjects. Establishing a harmony between man and nature was also a favorite of this time. Because of social instability, social issues appeared as main subjects in the 1980s. Art was influenced by various international events and exhibits in Korea, which brought more diversity. The Olympic Sculpture Garden in 1988, the transposition of the 1993 edition of the Whitney Biennial to Seoul, the creation of the Gwangju Biennale and the Korean Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1995 were notable events.

=== Architecture ===

Because of South Korea&#x27;s tumultuous history, construction and destruction has been repeated endlessly, resulting in an interesting melange of architectural styles and designs.

Traditional Korean architecture is characterized by its harmony with nature. Ancient architects adopted the bracket system characterized by thatched roofs and heated floors called &quot;ondol&quot;. People of the upper classes built bigger houses with elegantly curved tiled roofs and lifting eaves. Traditional architecture can be seen in the palaces and temples, preserved old houses called &quot;hanok&quot;, and special sites like Hahoe Folk Village, Yangdong Folk Village and Korean Folk Village. Traditional architecture may also be seen at several of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

Western architecture was first introduced at the end of the 19th century. Churches, offices for foreign legislation, schools and university buildings were built in new styles. With the annexation by Japan in 1910 the colonial regime intervened in Korea&#x27;s architectural heritage, and Japanese-style modern architecture was imposed. Anti-Japanese sentiment and the Korean War led to the destruction of most buildings constructed during that time.

Modern Korean architecture entered a new phase of development during the post-Korean War reconstruction, incorporating modern architectural trends and styles. Stimulated by the economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, active redevelopment saw new horizons in architectural design. In the aftermath of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, South Korea has witnessed a wide variation of styles in its architectural landscape with the opening up of the market to foreign architects. Contemporary architectural efforts have attempted to balance the traditional philosophy of &quot;harmony with nature&quot; and the fast-paced urbanization that the country has been going through in recent years.

=== Entertainment ===

In addition to domestic consumption, South Korea has a thriving entertainment industry where various facets of South Korean entertainment, including television dramas, films, and popular music, have garnered international popularity and generated significant export revenues for the nation&#x27;s economy. The cultural phenomenon known as &quot;Hallyu&quot; or the &quot;Korean Wave&quot;, has swept many countries across Continental and East Asia making South Korea a major soft power as an exporter of popular culture and entertainment, rivaling Western nations such as the United States and the United Kingdom.

Until the 1990s, trot and traditional folk-based ballads dominated the South Korean popular music scene. The emergence of the pop group Seo Taiji and Boys in 1992 marked a turning point for South Korean popular music, also known as K-pop. Since the 1990s, the genre of K-pop has continuously engaged in a process of ongoing reinvention and modernization by assimilating various elements of popular musical genres and trends from across the world such as Western popular music, experimental, jazz, gospel, Latin, hip hop, rhythm and blues, electronic dance, reggae, country, folk, and rock on top of its uniquely traditional Korean music roots. Though Western-style pop, hip hop, rhythm and blues, rock, folk, electronic dance oriented acts have become dominant in the contemporary South Korean popular music scene, trot still continues to be appreciated and enjoyed by older South Koreans. K-pop idols are well known across Continental Asia, have found fame in the Western World, and have generated millions of dollars in export revenue beyond the confines of the traditional East Asian music market. Many K-pop acts have also established themselves by securing a strong global following using online social media platforms such as YouTube. K-pop first began to make its mark outside of Continental and East Asia following the unexpected success of singer Psy&#x27;s international music sensation, &quot;Gangnam Style&quot;, which topped global music charts in 2012.

Since the success of the film &quot;Shiri&quot; in 1999, the Korean film industry has grown substantially, garnering recognition both nation-wide and across the globe. Domestic films have a dominant share of the South Korean film market, partly because of the existence of government screen quotas requiring cinemas to show Korean films for at least 73 days of the year. 2019&#x27;s &quot;Parasite&quot;, directed by Bong Joon-ho, became the highest-grossing film in South Korea as well as the first non-English language film to win Best Picture at the United States-based Academy Awards that year amongst numerous other accolades.

South Korean television shows have become popular outside of Korea. Television dramas, known as K-dramas, have begun to find fame internationally. Many dramas tend to have a romantic focus. Historical dramas are also famous&quot;.&quot; The 2021 survival drama &quot;Squid Game&quot;, created by Hwang Dong-hyuk, received critical acclaim and widespread international attention upon its release, becoming Netflix&#x27;s most-watched series at launch and garnering a viewership of more than 142 million households during its first four weeks from launch.

=== Holidays ===

The Korean New Year, or &quot;Seollal&quot;, is celebrated on the first day of the Korean calendar. Korean Independence Day falls on March 1 and commemorates the March First Movement of 1919. Memorial Day is celebrated on June 6, and its purpose is to honor the men and women who died in South Korea&#x27;s independence movement. Constitution Day is on July 17, and it celebrates the promulgation of Constitution of the Republic of Korea. Liberation Day, on August 15, celebrates Korea&#x27;s liberation from the Empire of Japan in 1945.

Every 15th day of the 8th lunar month, Koreans celebrate the Midautumn Festival, in which Koreans visit their ancestral hometowns and eat a variety of traditional Korean foods. On October 1, Armed Forces Day is celebrated, honoring the military forces of South Korea. October 3 is National Foundation Day. Hangul Day on October 9 commemorates the invention of hangul, the native alphabet of the Korean language.

=== Cuisine ===
Korean cuisine, &quot;hanguk yori&quot;, or &quot;hansik&quot;, has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Ingredients and dishes vary by province. There are many significant regional dishes that have proliferated in different variations across the country in the present day. The Korean royal court cuisine once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Meals consumed both by the royal family and ordinary citizens have been regulated by a unique culture of etiquette.

Korean cuisine is largely based on rice, noodles, tofu, vegetables, fish and meats. Traditional meals are noted for the number of side dishes, &quot;banchan&quot;, which accompany steam-cooked short-grain rice. Every meal is accompanied by numerous banchan. Kimchi, a fermented, usually spicy vegetable dish is commonly served at every meal and is one of the best known dishes. Korean cuisine usually involves heavy seasoning with sesame oil, &quot;doenjang&quot; (a type of fermented soybean paste), soy sauce, salt, garlic, ginger, and &quot;gochujang&quot; (a hot pepper paste). Other well-known dishes are &quot;bulgogi&quot;, grilled marinated beef; &quot;gimbap&quot;; and &quot;tteokbokki&quot;, a spicy snack consisting of rice cake seasoned with gochujang or a spicy chili paste.

Soups are also a common part of a meal and are served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal. Soups known as &quot;guk&quot; are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Similar to guk, &quot;tang&quot; has less water and is more often served in restaurants. Another type is &quot;jjigae&quot;, a stew that is typically heavily seasoned with chili pepper and served boiling hot.

Popular Korean alcoholic drinks include &quot;Soju&quot;, &quot;Makgeolli&quot; and &quot;Bokbunja ju&quot;. Korea is unique among East Asian countries in its use of metal chopsticks. Metal chopsticks have been discovered in Goguryeo archaeological sites.

=== Sports ===


The martial art taekwondo originated in Korea. In the 1950s and 1960s, modern rules were standardized, with taekwondo becoming an official Olympic sport in 2000. Other Korean martial arts include Taekkyon, hapkido, Tang Soo Do, Kuk Sool Won, kumdo and subak.

Football has traditionally been regarded as the most popular sport in Korea, with baseball as the second. Recent polling indicates that a majority, 41% of South Korean sports fans continue to self-identify as football fans, with baseball ranked 2nd at 25% of respondents. However, the polling did not indicate the extent to which respondents follow both sports.

The national football team became the first team in the Asian Football Confederation to reach the FIFA World Cup semi-finals in the 2002 FIFA World Cup, jointly hosted by South Korea and Japan. The Korea Republic national team (as it is known) has qualified for every World Cup since Mexico 1986, and has broken out of the group stage in 2002, in 2010, when it was defeated by eventual semi-finalist Uruguay in the Round of 16, and in 2022. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, South Korea won the bronze medal for football.

Baseball was first introduced to Korea in 1905. Recent years have been characterized by increasing attendance and ticket prices for professional baseball games. The Korea Professional Baseball league, a 10-team circuit, was established in 1982. The South Korea national team finished third in the 2006 World Baseball Classic and second in the 2009 tournament. The team&#x27;s 2009 final game against Japan was widely watched in Korea, with a large screen at Gwanghwamun crossing in Seoul broadcasting the game live. In the 2008 Summer Olympics, South Korea won the gold medal in baseball. Also in 1982, at the Baseball Worldcup, Korea won the gold medal. At the 2010 Asian Games, the Korean National Baseball team won the gold medal. Several Korean players have gone on to play in Major League Baseball.

Basketball is a popular sport in the country as well. South Korea has traditionally had one of the top basketball teams in Asia and one of the continent&#x27;s strongest basketball divisions. Seoul hosted the 1967 and 1995 Asian Basketball Championship. The Korea national basketball team has won a record number of 23 medals at the event to date.
South Korea hosted the Asian Games in 1986 (Seoul), 2002 (Busan), and 2014 (Incheon). It also hosted the Winter Universiade in 1997, the Asian Winter Games in 1999, and the Summer Universiade in 2003 and 2015. In 1988, South Korea hosted the Summer Olympics in Seoul, coming fourth with 12 gold medals, 10 silver medals, and 11 bronze medals. South Korea regularly performs well in archery, shooting, table tennis, badminton, short track speed skating, handball, field hockey, freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman wrestling, baseball, judo, taekwondo, speed skating, figure skating, and weightlifting. The Seoul Olympic Museum is dedicated to the 1988 Summer Olympics.

Pyeongchang hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics. South Korea has won more medals in the Winter Olympics than any other Asian country, with a total of 45 (23 gold, 14 silver, and 8 bronze). At the 2010 Winter Olympics, South Korea ranked fifth in the overall medal rankings. South Korea is especially strong in short track speed skating. Speed skating and figure skating are also popular, and ice hockey is an emerging sport, with Anyang Halla winning their first ever Asia League Ice Hockey title in March 2010.

Seoul hosted a professional triathlon race, which is part of the International Triathlon Union (ITU) World Championship Series in 2010. In 2011, the South Korean city of Daegu hosted the 2011 IAAF World Championships in Athletics. In 2010, South Korea hosted its first Formula One race at the Korea International Circuit in Yeongam. The Korean Grand Prix was held from 2010 to 2013.

Domestic horse racing events are followed by South Koreans and Seoul Race Park in Gwacheon, Gyeonggi Province is located closest to Seoul out of the country&#x27;s three tracks.

Competitive video gaming, also called esports, has become more popular in South Korea in recent years, particularly among young people. The two most popular games are League of Legends and StarCraft. The gaming scene is managed by the Korean e-Sports Association.

<text>The history of South Korea begins with the Japanese surrender on 2 September 1945. At that time, South Korea and North Korea were divided, despite being the same people and on the same peninsula. In 1950, the Korean War broke out. North Korea overran South Korea until US-led UN forces intervened. At the end of the war in 1953, the border between South and North remained largely similar. Tensions between the two sides continued. South Korea alternated between dictatorship and liberal democracy. It underwent substantial economic development.

==Background==

After Japan&#x27;s defeat in the Pacific War in 1945, the Korean region, which was part of Japan&#x27;s territory, was occupied by American and Soviet forces. In 1948, with the end of the U.S. military government, South Korea declared its independence from Japan as the Republic of Korea. In 1952, when Japan approved the independence of the Korean region under the San Francisco Peace Treaty, it became a completely independent and sovereign nation under international law. The unconditional surrender of Japan led to the division of Korea into two occupation zones (similar to the four zones in Germany), with the United States administering the southern half of the peninsula and the Soviet Union administering the area north of the 38th parallel. This division was meant to be temporary (as was in Germany) and was first intended to return a unified Korea back to its people after the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China could arrange a single government for the peninsula.

The two parties were unable to agree on the implementation of a Joint Trusteeship over Korea because of 2 different opinions. This led in 1948 to the establishment of two separate governments with the two very opposite ideologies; the Communist-aligned Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) and the West-aligned First Republic of Korea – each claiming to be the legitimate government of all of Korea. On 25 June 1950, the Korean War broke out. After much destruction, the war ended on 27 July 1953, with the 1948 status quo being restored, as neither the DPRK nor the First Republic had succeeded in conquering the other&#x27;s portion of the divided Korea. The peninsula was divided by the Korean Demilitarized Zone and the two separate governments stabilized into the existing political entities of North and South Korea.

South Korea&#x27;s subsequent history is marked by alternating periods of democratic and autocratic rule. Civilian governments are conventionally numbered from the First Republic of Syngman Rhee to the contemporary Sixth Republic. The First Republic, arguably democratic at its inception (though preceded by major anti-communist and anti-socialist purges), became increasingly autocratic until its collapse in 1960. The Second Republic was strongly democratic but was overthrown in under a year and replaced by an autocratic military regime. The Third, Fourth, and Fifth Republics were nominally democratic, but are widely regarded as the continuation of military rule. With the current Sixth Republic, the country has gradually stabilized into a liberal democracy.

Since its inception, South Korea has seen substantial development in education, economy, and culture. Since the 1960s, the nation has developed from one of Asia&#x27;s poorest to one of the world&#x27;s wealthiest nations. Education, particularly at the tertiary level, has expanded dramatically. It is said to be one of the &quot;Four Tigers&quot; of rising Asian states along with Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

==U.S. military administration (1945–1948)==

Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of the Empire of Japan to the Allied Powers on 15 August 1945. General Order No. 1 for the surrender of Japan (prepared by the Joint Chiefs of Staff of U.S. military forces and approved on 17 August 1945) prescribed separate surrender procedures for Japanese forces in Korea north and south of the 38th parallel. After Japan&#x27;s surrender to the Allies (formalised on 2 September 1945), division at the 38th parallel marked the beginning of Soviet and U.S. occupation of the North and South, respectively. This division was meant to be temporary, to be replaced by a trusteeship of the United States, United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and Republic of China which would prepare for Korean independence. The trusteeship had been discussed at the Yalta Conference in February 1945. U.S. forces landed at Incheon on 8 September 1945, and established a military government shortly thereafter. Lieutenant General John R. Hodge, their commander, took charge of the government. Faced with mounting popular discontent, in October 1945 Hodge established the Korean Advisory Council. The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, which had operated from China, sent a delegation with three interpreters to Hodge, but he refused to meet with them. Likewise, Hodge refused to recognize the newly formed People&#x27;s Republic of Korea and its People&#x27;s Committees, and outlawed it on 12 December. A year later, an interim legislature and interim government were established, headed by Kim Kyu-shik and Syngman Rhee respectively. Political and economic chaos – arising from a variety of causes – plagued the country in this period. The after-effects of the Japanese exploitation remained in the South, as in the North. In addition, the U.S. military was largely unprepared for the challenge of administering the country, arriving with little knowledge of the language, culture or political situation. Thus many of their policies had unintended destabilizing effects. Waves of refugees from North Korea and returnees from abroad added to the turmoil.

In December 1945 a conference convened in Moscow to discuss the future of Korea.
A five-year trusteeship was discussed, and a was established. The commission met intermittently in Seoul but deadlocked over the issue of establishing a national government. In September 1947, with no solution in sight, the United States submitted the Korean question to the UN General Assembly.

The resolution from the UN General Assembly called for a UN-supervised general election in Korea, but after the North rejected this proposition, a general election for a Constitutional Assembly took place in the South only, in May 1948. A constitution was adopted, setting forth a presidential form of government and specifying a four-year term for the presidency. According to the provisions of the Constitution, an indirect presidential election took place in July. Rhee Syngman, as head of the new assembly, assumed the presidency and proclaimed the Republic of Korea (South Korea) on 15 August 1948.

==First Republic (1948–1960)==
On 15 August 1948, the Republic of Korea was formally established, with Syngman Rhee as the first president. With the establishment of Rhee&#x27;s government, de jure sovereignty also passed into the new government. On 9 September 1948, a communist government, the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (North Korea), was proclaimed under Kim Il Sung. However, on 12 December 1948, by its resolution 195 in the Third General Assembly, the United Nations recognized the Republic of Korea as the sole legal government of Korea.

In 1946, the North implemented land reforms by confiscating private property, Japanese and pro-Japanese owned facilities and factories, and placed them under state ownership. Demand for land reform in the South grew strong, and it was eventually enacted in June 1949. Koreans with large landholdings were obliged to divest most of their land. Approximately 40 percent of total farm households became small landowners. However, because preemptive rights were given to people who had ties with landowners before liberation, many pro-Japanese groups obtained or retained properties.

With the country now divided, the relationship between the two Koreas turned more antagonistic as time passed. The Soviet forces having withdrawn in 1948, North Korea pressured the South to expel the United States forces, but Rhee sought to align his government strongly with America, and against both North Korea and Japan. Although talks towards normalization of relations with Japan took place, they achieved little. Meanwhile, the government took in vast sums of American aid, in amounts sometimes near the total size of the national budget. The nationalist government also continued many of the practices of the U.S. military government. In 1948, the Rhee government repressed military uprisings in Jeju, Suncheon and Yeosu. During the rebellion and its suppression 14,000 to 60,000 people were killed in all fighting. Of note, President Rhee&#x27;s regime was intolerant of opposition. A famous event that highlighted this was the arrest and conviction of future President Park Chung Hee, for communist conspiracy in 1948.

The main policy of the First Republic of South Korea was anti-communism and &quot;unification by expanding northward&quot;. The South&#x27;s military was neither sufficiently equipped nor prepared, but the Rhee administration was determined to reunify Korea by military force with aid from the United States. However, in the second parliamentary elections held on 30 May 1950, the majority of seats went to independents who did not endorse this position, confirming the lack of support and the fragile state of the nation.

When the communist army attacked from the North in June, retreating South Korean forces executed tens of thousands suspected communists or sympathisers, either in prison or in a reeducation movement, in what is known as the Bodo League massacre.

On 25 June 1950, North Korean forces invaded South Korea. Led by the U.S., a 16-member coalition undertook the first collective action under the United Nations Command (UNC) in defense of South Korea. Oscillating battle lines inflicted a high number of civilian casualties and wrought immense destruction. With the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s entry on behalf of North Korea in late 1950, the fighting came to a stalemate close to the original line of demarcation. Armistice negotiations, initiated in July 1951, finally concluded on 27 July 1953 at Panmunjom, now in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Following the armistice, the South Korean government returned to Seoul on the symbolic date of 15 August 1953.

After the armistice, South Korea experienced political turmoil under years of autocratic leadership of Syngman Rhee, which was ended by student revolt in 1960. Throughout his rule, Rhee sought to take additional steps to cement his control of government. These began in 1952, when the government was still based in Busan due to the ongoing war. In May of that year, Rhee pushed through constitutional amendments which made the presidency a directly-elected position. To do this, he declared martial law, arrested opposing members of parliament, demonstrators, and anti-government groups. Rhee was subsequently elected by a wide margin.

Rhee regained control of parliament in the 1954 election, and thereupon pushed through an amendment to exempt himself from the eight-year term limit, and was once again re-elected in 1956. Soon after, Rhee&#x27;s administration arrested members of the opposing party and executed the leader after accusing him of being a North Korean spy.

The administration became increasingly repressive while dominating the political arena, and in 1958, it sought to amend the National Security Law to tighten government control over all levels of administration, including the local units. These measures caused much outrage among the people, but despite public outcry, Rhee&#x27;s administration rigged the March 1960 presidential election and won by a landslide.

On that election day, protests by students and citizens against the irregularities of the election burst out in the city of Masan. Initially these protests were quelled with force by local police, but when the body of a student was found floating in the harbor of Masan, the whole country was enraged and protests spread nationwide. On 19 April, students from various universities and schools rallied and marched in protest in the Seoul streets, in what would be called the April Revolution. The government declared martial law, called in the army, and suppressed the crowds with open fire. Subsequent protests throughout the country shook the government, and after an escalated protest with university professors taking to the streets on 25 April, Rhee submitted his official resignation on 26 April and fled into exile.

==Second Republic (1960–1963)==

After the student revolution, power was briefly held by an interim administration under the Foreign Minister Heo Jeong. A new parliamentary election was held on 29 July 1960. The Democratic Party, which had been in the opposition during the First Republic, easily gained power and the Second Republic was established. The revised constitution dictated the Second Republic to take the form of a parliamentary cabinet system where the President took only a nominal role. This was the first and the only instance South Korea turned to a parliamentary cabinet system instead of a presidential system. The assembly elected Yun Po-sun as President and Chang Myon as the Prime Minister and head of government in August 1960.

The Second Republic saw the proliferation of political activity which had been repressed under the Rhee regime. Much of this activity was from leftist and student groups, which had been instrumental in the overthrow of the First Republic. Union membership and activity grew rapidly during the later months of 1960, including the Teachers&#x27; Union, Journalists&#x27; Union, and the Federation of Korean Trade Union. Around 2,000 demonstrations were held during the eight months of the Second Republic.

Under pressure from the left, the Chang government carried out a series of purges of military and police officials who had been involved in anti-democratic activities or corruption. A Special Law to this effect was passed on 31 October 1960. 40,000 people were placed under investigation; of these, more than 2,200 government officials and 4,000 police officers were purged. In addition, the government considered reducing the size of the army by 100,000, although this plan was shelved.

In economic terms as well, the government was faced with mounting instability. The government formulated a Five-Year Economic Development Plan, although it was unable to act on it prior to being overthrown. The Second Republic saw the &quot;hwan&quot; lose half of its value against the dollar between fall 1960 and spring 1961.

Although the government had been established with support of the people, it had failed to implement effective reforms which brought about endless social unrest, political turmoil and ultimately, the May 16 coup.

===Military rule (1961–1963)===
The May 16 coup, led by Major General Park Chung Hee on 16 May 1961, put an effective end to the Second Republic. Park was one of a group of military leaders who had been pushing for the de-politicization of the military. Dissatisfied with the cleanup measures undertaken by the Second Republic and convinced that the current disoriented state would collapse into communism, they chose to take matters into their own hands.

The National Assembly was dissolved and military officers replaced the civilian officials. In May 1961, the junta declared &quot;Pledges of the Revolution&quot;: anticommunism; strengthened relations with the United States; an end to government corruption termed &quot;fresh and clean morality&quot;; a self-reliant economy; working towards reunification; and a return to democratic civilian government within two years.

As a means to check the opposition, the military authority created the Korean Central Intelligence Agency (KCIA) in June 1961, with Kim Jong-pil, a relative of Park, as its first director. In December 1962, a referendum was held on returning to a presidential system of rule, which was allegedly passed with a 78% majority. Park and the other military leaders pledged not to run for office in the next elections. However, Park became presidential candidate of the new Democratic Republican Party (DRP), which consisted of mainly KCIA officials, ran for president and won the election of 1963 by a narrow margin.

==Third Republic (1963–1972)==
Park&#x27;s administration started the Third Republic by announcing the Five-Year Economic Development Plan, an export-oriented industrialization policy. Top priority was placed on the growth of a self-reliant economy and modernization; &quot;Development First, Unification Later&quot; became the slogan of the times and the economy grew rapidly with vast improvement in industrial structure, especially in the basic and heavy chemical industries. Capital was needed for such development, so the Park regime used the influx of foreign aid from Japan and the United States to provide loans to export businesses, with preferential treatment in obtaining low-interest bank loans and tax benefits. Cooperating with the government, these businesses would later become the &quot;chaebol&quot;.

Relations with Japan were normalized by the Korea-Japan treaty ratified in June 1965. This treaty brought Japanese funds in the form of loans and compensation for the damages suffered during the colonial era without an official apology from the Japanese government, sparking much protest across the nation.

The government also kept close ties with the United States, and continued to receive large amounts of aid. A status of forces agreement was concluded in 1966, clarifying the legal situation of the US forces stationed there. Soon thereafter, Korea joined the Vietnam War, eventually sending a total of 300,000 soldiers from 1964 to 1973 to fight alongside US troops and South Vietnamese Armed Forces.

Economic and technological growth during this period improved the standard of living, which expanded opportunities for education. Workers with higher education were absorbed by the rapidly growing industrial and commercial sectors, and urban population surged. Construction of the Gyeongbu Expressway was completed and linked Seoul to the nation&#x27;s southeastern region and the port cities of Incheon and Busan. Despite the immense economic growth, however, the standard of living for city laborers and farmers was still low. Laborers were working with low wages to increase the price competitiveness for the export-oriented economy plan, and farmers were in near poverty as the government controlled prices. As the rural economy steadily lost ground and caused dissent among the farmers, however, the government decided to implement measures to increase farm productivity and income by instituting the Saemaul Movement (&quot;New Village Movement&quot;) in 1971. The movement&#x27;s goal was to improve the quality of rural life, modernize both rural and urban societies and narrow the income gap between them.

Park ran again in the 1967 presidential election, taking 51.4% of the vote. At the time the presidency was constitutionally limited to two terms, but a constitutional amendment was forced through the National Assembly in 1969 to allow him to seek a third term. Major protests and demonstrations against the constitutional amendment broke out, with large support gaining for the opposition leader Kim Dae-jung, but Park was again re-elected in the 1971 presidential election.

Parliamentary elections followed shortly after the presidential election where the opposition party garnered most of the seats, giving them the power to pass constitutional amendments. Park, feeling threatened, declared a state of national emergency on 6 December 1971. In the midst of this domestic insecurity, the Nixon Doctrine had eased tensions among the world superpowers on the international scene, which caused a dilemma for Park, who had justified his regime based on the state policy of anti-communism. In a sudden gesture, the government proclaimed a joint communiqué for reunification with North Korea on 4 July 1972, and held Red Cross talks in Seoul and Pyongyang. However, there was no change in government policy regarding reunification, and on 17 October 1972, Park declared martial law, dissolving the National Assembly and suspending the constitution.

==Fourth Republic (1972–1981)==
The Fourth Republic began with the adoption of the Yushin Constitution on 21 November 1972. This new constitution gave Park effective control over the parliament and the possibility of permanent presidency. The president would be elected through indirect election by an elected body, and the term of presidency was extended to six years with no restrictions on reappointment. The legislature and judiciary were controlled by the government, and educational guidelines were under direct surveillance as well. Textbooks supporting the ideology of the military government were authorized by the government, diminishing the responsibilities of the Ministry of Education.

Despite social and political unrest, the economy continued to flourish under the authoritarian rule with the export-based industrialization policy. The first two five-year economic development plans were successful, and the 3rd and 4th five-year plans focused on expanding the heavy and chemical industries, raising the capability for steel production and oil refining. However, large conglomerate &quot;chaebols&quot; continuously received preferential treatment and came to dominate the domestic market. As most of the development had come from foreign capital, most of the profit went back to repaying the loans and interest.

Students and activists for democracy continued their demonstrations and protests for the abolition of the Yushin system and in the face of continuing popular unrest, Park&#x27;s administration promulgated emergency decrees in 1974 and 1975, which led to the jailing of hundreds of dissidents. The protests grew larger and stronger, with politicians, intellectuals, religious leaders, laborers and farmers all joining in the movement for democracy. In 1978, Park was elected to another term by indirect election, which was met with more demonstrations and protests. The government retaliated by removing the opposition leader Kim Young-sam from the assembly and suppressing the activists with violent means. In 1979, mass anti-government demonstrations occurred nationwide, in the midst of this political turmoil, Park Chung Hee was assassinated by the director of the KCIA, Kim Jae-gyu, thus bringing the 18-year rule of military regime to an end.

==Fifth Republic (1981–1988)==
After the assassination of Park Chung-hee, Prime Minister Choi Kyu-hah took the president&#x27;s role only to be usurped 6 days later by Major General Chun Doo-hwan&#x27;s 1979 Coup d&#x27;état of December Twelfth. In May of the following year, a vocal civil society composed primarily of university students and labour unions led strong protests against authoritarian rule all over the country. Chun Doo-hwan declared martial law on 17 May 1980, and protests escalated. Political opponents Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-pil were arrested, and Kim Young-sam was confined to house arrest.

On 18 May 1980, a confrontation broke out in the city of Gwangju between protesting students of Chonnam National University and the armed forces dispatched by the Martial Law Command. The incident turned into a citywide protest that lasted nine days until 27 May and resulted in the Gwangju massacre. Immediate estimates of the civilian death toll ranged from a few dozen to 2000, with a later full investigation by the civilian government finding nearly 200 deaths and 850 injured. In June 1980, Chun ordered the National Assembly to be dissolved. He subsequently created the National Defense Emergency Policy Committee, and installed himself as a member. On 17 July, he resigned his position of KCIA Director, and then held only the position of committee member. In September 1980, President Choi Kyu-hah was forced to resign from president to give way to the new military leader, Chun Doo-hwan.

In September of that year, Chun was elected president by indirect election and inaugurated in March of the following year, officially starting the Fifth Republic. A new Constitution was established with notable changes; maintaining the presidential system but limiting it to a single 7-year term, strengthening the authority of the National Assembly, and conferring the responsibilities of appointing judiciary to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. However, the system of indirect election of the president stayed and many military persons were appointed to highly ranked government positions, keeping the remnants of the Yushin era.

The government promised a new era of economic growth and democratic justice. Tight monetary laws and low interest rates contributed to price stability and helped the economy boom with notable growth in the electronics, semi-conductor, and automobile industries. The country opened up to foreign investments and GDP rose as Korean exports increased. This rapid economic growth, however, widened the gap between the rich and the poor, the urban and rural regions, and also exacerbated inter-regional conflicts. These dissensions, added to the hard-line measures taken against opposition to the government, fed intense rural and student movements, which had continued since the beginning of the republic.

In foreign policy, ties with Japan were strengthened by state visits by Chun to Japan and Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone to Korea. U.S. President Ronald Reagan also paid a visit, and relations with the Soviet Union and China improved. The relationship with North Korea was strained when in 1983 a terrorist bomb attack in Burma killed 17 high-ranking officials attending memorial ceremonies and North Korea was alleged to be behind the attacks. However, in 1980 North Korea had submitted a &quot;one nation, two system&quot; reunification proposal which was met with a suggestion from the South to meet and prepare a unification constitution and government through a referendum. The humanitarian issue of reuniting separated families was dealt with first, and in September 1985, families from both sides of the border made cross visits to Seoul and Pyongyang in an historic event.
The government made many efforts for cultural development: the National Museum of Korea, Seoul Arts Center, and National Museum of Contemporary Art were all constructed during this time. The 1986 Asian Games were held successfully, and the bid for the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul was successful as well.

Despite economic growth and success in diplomatic relations, the government that gained power by coup d&#x27;état was essentially a military regime and the public&#x27;s support and trust in it was low when the promises for democratic reform never materialized. In the 1985 National Assembly elections, opposition parties won more votes than the government party, clearly indicating that the public wanted a change. Many started to sympathize with the protesting students. The Gwangju massacre was never forgotten and in January 1987, when a protesting Seoul National University student died under police interrogation, public fury was immense. In April 1987, President Chun made a declaration that measures would be taken to protect the current constitution, instead of reforming it to allow for the direct election of the president. This announcement consolidated and strengthened the opposition; in June 1987, more than a million students and citizens participated in the nationwide anti-government protests of the June Struggle.

On 29 June 1987, the government&#x27;s presidential nominee Roh Tae-woo gave in to the demands and announced the June 29 Declaration, which called for the holding of direct presidential elections and restoration of civil rights. In October 1987 a revised Constitution was approved by a national referendum and direct elections for a new president were held in December, bringing the Fifth Republic to a close.

==Sixth Republic (1988–&quot;present&quot;) ==

The Sixth Republic was established on 25 February 1988 and remains the current — and by far the longest-lasting — polity of South Korea.

===Roh Tae-woo, 1988–1993===

Roh Tae-woo became president for the 13th presidential term in the first direct presidential election in 16 years. Although Roh was from a military background and one of the leaders of Chun&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état, the inability of the opposition leaders Kim Dae-jung and Kim Young-sam to agree on a unified candidacy led to him being elected. The first female presidential candidate, Hong Sook-ja, even withdrew from the race in order to back Kim Young-sam against Roh.

Roh was officially inaugurated in February 1988. The government set out to eliminate past vestiges of authoritarian rule by revising laws and decrees to fit democratic provisions. Freedom of the press was expanded, university autonomy was recognised, and restrictions on overseas travel were lifted. However, the growth of the economy had slowed down compared to the 1980s, resulting in stagnant exports while commodity prices kept on rising.

Shortly after Roh&#x27;s inauguration, the 1988 Summer Olympics took place, raising South Korea&#x27;s international recognition and greatly influencing foreign policy. Roh&#x27;s government announced the official unification plan, &quot;Nordpolitik&quot;, and established diplomatic ties with the Soviet Union, China, and countries in Eastern Europe.

A historic event was held in 1990 when North Korea accepted the proposal for exchange between the two Koreas, resulting in high-level talks and cultural and sports exchanges. In 1991, a joint communiqué on denuclearization was agreed upon, and the two Koreas simultaneously became members of the UN.

===Kim Young-sam, 1993–1998===

Kim Young-sam was elected president in the 1992 elections after Roh&#x27;s tenure. He was the country&#x27;s first civilian president in 30 years since 1962 and promised to build a &quot;New Korea&quot;. The government set out to address the authoritarianism of the previous administrations. Local government elections were held in 1995, and parliamentary elections followed in 1996. In response to popular demand, former presidents Chun and Roh were both indicted on charges linked to bribery, illegal funds, and, in the case of Chun, responsibility for the Gwangju Uprising. They were tried and sentenced to prison in December 1996.

Relations with the North improved, and a summit meeting was planned but postponed indefinitely with the death of Kim Il Sung. Tensions varied between the two Koreas after that, with cycles of small military skirmishes and apologies. The government also carried out substantial financial and economic reforms, joining the OECD in 1996, but encountered difficulties with political and financial scandals involving his son. The country also faced a variety of catastrophes: the Gupo Station rail accident and the sinking of MV &quot;Seohae&quot; in 1993, the Seongsu Bridge disaster in 1994, and the Sampoong Department Store collapse in 1995.

In 1997, the nation suffered a severe financial crisis, and the government approached the International Monetary Fund for relief. Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung won the presidency that year, a first for the country.

===Kim Dae-jung 1998–2003===
In February 1998, Kim Dae-jung was officially inaugurated. South Korea had maintained its commitment to democratize its political processes and this was the first transfer of the government between parties by peaceful means. Kim&#x27;s government faced the daunting task of overcoming the economic crisis, but with the joint efforts of the government&#x27;s aggressive pursuit of foreign investment, cooperation from the industrial sector, and the citizen&#x27;s gold-collecting campaign, the country was able to come out of the crisis in a relatively short period of time.

Industrial reconstruction of the big conglomerate &quot;chaebols&quot; was pursued, a national pension system was established in 1998, educational reforms were carried out, government support for the IT field was increased, and notable cultural properties were registered as UNESCO Cultural Heritage sites. The 2002 FIFA World Cup, co-hosted with Japan, was a major cultural event where millions of supporters gathered to cheer in public places.

In diplomacy, Kim Dae-jung pursued the &quot;Sunshine Policy&quot;, a series of efforts to reconcile with North Korea. This culminated in reunions of the separated families of the Korean War and a summit talk with North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. For these efforts, Kim Dae-jung was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000.

===Roh Moo-hyun, 2003–2008===
Roh Moo-hyun was elected to the presidency in December 2002 by direct election. His victory came with much support from the younger generation and civic groups who had hopes of participatory democracy, and Roh&#x27;s administration consequently launched with the motto of &quot;participation government&quot;. Unlike the previous governments, the administration decided to take a long-term view and execute market-based reforms gradually. This approach did not please the public: approval ratings fell by the end of 2003.

The Roh administration succeeded in overcoming regionalism in South Korean politics, diluting the collusive ties between politics and business, empowering civil society, settling the South Korea-United States trade disagreement, continuing summit talks with North Korea, and launching the high-speed train system KTX. But despite a boom in the stock market, youth unemployment rates were high, real estate prices skyrocketed, and the economy lagged.

In March 2004, the National Assembly voted to impeach Roh regarding breach of election laws and corruption. This motion rallied his supporters and affected the outcome of the parliamentary election held in April, with the ruling party becoming the majority. Roh was reinstated in May by the Constitutional Court, which had overturned the verdict. However, the ruling party then lost its majority in by-elections in 2005, as discontinued reform plans, continual labor unrest, Roh&#x27;s personal feuds with the media, and diplomatic friction with the United States and Japan caused criticism of the government&#x27;s competence on political and socioeconomic issues and on foreign affairs.

In April 2009, after leaving office, Roh Moo-hyun and his family members were investigated for bribery and corruption; Roh denied the charges. On 23 May 2009, Roh committed suicide by jumping into a ravine.

===Lee Myung-bak, 2008–2013===
Roh&#x27;s successor, Lee Myung-bak, was inaugurated in February 2008. Stating &quot;creative pragmatism&quot; as a guiding principle, Lee&#x27;s administration set out to revitalize the flagging economy, re-energize diplomatic ties, stabilize social welfare, and meet the challenges of globalization. In April 2008, the ruling party secured a majority in the National Assembly elections. Also that month, summit talks with the United States addressed the Korea-US Free Trade Agreement and helped ease tensions between the two countries caused by the previous administrations. Lee agreed to lift the ban on US beef imports, which caused massive protests and demonstrations in the months that followed, as paranoia of potential mad cow disease gripped the country.

Many issues plagued the government, starting from the arson of the Namdaemun gates, in which the government was accused of not providing adequate security. Further controversies arose over the years regarding the appointment of high-ranking government officials, rampant political conflicts, accusations of oppression of media, and strained diplomatic relationships with North Korea and Japan. The global recession affected the economy as the worst economic crisis since 1997 hit the country. The Lee administration tackled these issues by actively issuing statements, reshuffling the cabinet, and implementing administrative and industrial reforms.

The economy bounced back after regulatory and economic reforms, with the country&#x27;s economy marking growth and recovering from the global recession. The administration also pursued improved diplomatic relations by holding summit talks with the United States, China, and Japan and participating in the ASEAN-ROK Commemorative Summit to strengthen ties with other Asian countries. The 2010 G20 summit was held in Seoul, where issues regarding the global economic crisis were discussed.

In October 2020, South Korea&#x27;s Supreme Court upheld a 17-year prison sentence for former president Lee Myung-bak because of taking bribes before and during his presidency.

===Park Geun-hye, 2013–2017===
Park Geun-hye was inaugurated in February 2013. She is the eleventh President of South Korea and is the eldest child of South Korea&#x27;s stratocratic third President, Park Chung Hee. She was the first woman to be elected South Korean president, and to be elected as a head of state in the modern history of Northeast Asia. Her reputation during her presidency was eventually marred by her incompetency of handling the &quot;Sewol&quot; ferry disaster, the 2015 MERS outbreak, and later a major scandal, leading to her impeachment in December 2016. The corruption scandal involving Choi Soon-sil quickly blew up after reports from multiple news organizations (the most notable of which was JTBC) in 2016, nationwide protests ensued weekly, with participant count hitting a maximum of over 2.3 million (as reported by the protesters). These protests turned out to be the biggest mass protests in Korean history. The protests continued even after Congress voted on Park&#x27;s impeachment. Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn acted as President of South Korea pending completion of investigations into the actions of Park Geun-hye, and in the absence of any intervening election. The Constitutional Court upheld the impeachment on 10 March 2017, ending Park&#x27;s presidency and forcing her out of office.

In April 2018, former president Park Geun-hye was sentenced to 24 years in jail because of abuse of power and corruption.

===Moon Jae-in, 2017–2022===
Moon Jae-in was inaugurated on 10 May 2017. As President, his tenure saw an improving political relationship with North Korea, some increasing divergence in the military alliance with the United States, and the successful hosting of the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang. Moon Jae-in met with North Korean chairman Kim Jong Un at the April 2018 inter-Korean summit, May 2018 inter-Korean summit, and September 2018 inter-Korean summit. During the COVID-19 outbreak, President Moon had gained a positive reputation both domestically and internationally with the initial successes of controlling the outbreak. Subsequent outbreaks in 2021, however, caused his ratings to plummet. As of 2021, South Korea recorded more deaths than births, resulting in a population decline for the first time on record.

In April 2020, President Moon&#x27;s Democratic party won a landslide victory in parliamentary elections. It took 180 seats in the 300-member National Assembly with its allies. The opposition People Power Party (UFP) won 103 seats.

President Moon finished his term on 9 May 2022. His successor, People Power Party candidate Yoon Suk-yeol, took over the seat on 10 May 2022 after winning narrowly the 2022 South Korean presidential election.

===Yoon Suk-yeol, since 2022===
On 29 October 2022, at least 153 people were crushed to death when a crowd surged in an alleyway during Halloween festivities in Seoul&#x27;s Itaewon district. President Yoon declared a state of official national mourning.

The &quot;Unification Act on the Calculation of Age&quot; took effect on 28 June 2023. The &quot;Unification Act on the Calculation of Age&quot; was promoted to resolve social and administrative confusion and disputes arising from mixing various age calculation methods. It is President Yoon Suk Yeol&#x27;s representative presidential election pledge and the 13th of the 120 state affairs of the Yoon Suk Yeol government.

In the 22nd National Assembly election held on 10 April 2024, the People Power Party to which Yoon Suk Yeol belongs won 108 out of 300 seats, while the opposition Democratic Party of Korea won 175.

On 3 December 2024, Yoon enacted martial law to rid the opposition of &#x27;Anti-State Influence&#x27;. Following a few hours of unrest, the National Assembly unanimously passed a motion to lift martial law. Many hours of protest later, with the army unable to stand down without presidential authority, Yoon lifted his prior declaration of martial law and ordered the military to stand down.

Yoon was subsequently impeached on 14 December by the National Assembly and suspended from office pending a final ruling by the Constitutional Court on whether to confirm his removal from the presidency.

On 29 December 2024, Jeju Air plane crash at Muan International Airport in South Korea killed 179 people, being the deadliest air disaster on the nation&#x27;s soil.

<text>South Korea is located in East Asia, on the southern portion of the Korean Peninsula located out from the far east of the Asian landmass. The only country that shares a land border with South Korea is North Korea, lying to the north with of the border running along the Korean Demilitarized Zone. South Korea is mostly surrounded by water and has of coast line along three seas; to the west is the Yellow Sea (called &quot;Sohae&quot; ; in South Korea, literally means west sea), to the south is the East China Sea, and to the east is the Sea of Japan (called &quot;Donghae&quot; ; in South Korea, literally means east sea). Geographically, South Korea&#x27;s landmass is approximately . of South Korea are occupied by water. The approximate coordinates are 37° North, 128° East.

==Land area and borders==

The Korean Peninsula extends southward from the northeast part of the Asian continental landmass. The Japanese islands of Honshū and Kyūshū are located some 200  km (124  mi) to the southeast across the Korea Strait; the Shandong Peninsula of China lies 190 kilometers to the west. The west coast of the peninsula is bordered by the Korea Bay to the north and the Yellow Sea and Korea Strait to the south; the east coast is bordered by the Sea of Japan. The 8,640-kilometer coastline is highly indented. Some 3,579 islands lie adjacent to the peninsula. Most of them are found along the south and west coasts.

After World War II and before June 25, 1950, the line between the two Korean states was the thirty-eighth parallel of latitude. After the Korean War, the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) formed the boundary between the two. The DMZ is a heavily guarded, 4,000-meter-wide strip of land that runs along the demarcation line established by the Korean Armistice Agreement from the east to the west coasts for a distance of 241 kilometers (238 kilometers of that line from the land boundary with North Korea).

The total land area of the peninsula, including the islands, is 223,170 square kilometers. Some 44.8 percent (100 210 square kilometers) of this total, excluding the area within the DMZ, constitutes the territory of the Republic of Korea. The combined territories of North Korea and South Korea are about the same size as the United Kingdom. South Korea alone is about the size of Portugal or Hungary, or the U.S. state of Indiana.

The largest island, Jeju Province, lies off the southwest corner of the peninsula and has a land area of 1,825 square kilometers. Other important islands include Ulleung and Liancourt Rocks in the Sea of Japan and Ganghwa Island at the mouth of the Han River. Although the eastern coastline of South Korea is generally unindented, the southern and western coasts are jagged and irregular. The difference is caused by the fact that the eastern coast is gradually rising, while the southern and western coasts are subsiding.

==Topography and drainage==
South Korea is largely mountainous, with 3/4 of its landmass consisting of mountains. Early European visitors to Korea remarked that the land resembled &quot;a sea in a heavy gale&quot; because of the large number of successive mountain ranges. Many tall mountains exceeding , which are concentrated in the north and the east, form the &quot;topological backbone&quot; of the country. There are two major mountain ranges within South Korea: the Taebaek Mountains, and the Sobaek Mountains. The highest mountain peak in South Korea is Hallasan (), which is the cone of a volcanic formation constituting Jeju Island. Geologically, Precambrian rocks such as granite make up the landmass.

Approximately 30 percent of the area of South Korea consists of lowlands, with the rest consisting of uplands and mountains. The great majority of the lowland area lies along the coasts, particularly the west coast, and along the major rivers. The most important lowlands are the Han River plain around Seoul, the Pyeongtaek coastal plain southwest of Seoul, the Geum River basin, the Nakdong River basin, and the Yeongsan River and the Honam plains in the southwest. A narrow littoral plain extends along the east coast. A recent global remote sensing analysis suggested that there were 1,833 km2 of tidal flats in South Korea, making it the 17th ranking country in terms of how much tidal flat occurs there.

The Nakdong is South Korea&#x27;s longest river (). The Han River, which flows through Seoul, is long, and the Geum River is long. These three rivers have their sources in the Taebaek Mountains. Other major rivers include the Imjin, which flows through both North Korea and South Korea and forms an estuary with the Han River; the Bukhan, a tributary of the Han that also flows out of North Korea; and the Somjin. The major rivers flow north to south or east to west and empty into the Yellow Sea or the Korea Strait. They tend to be broad and shallow and to have wide seasonal variations in water flow.

In the early part of the 20th century and especially the period during and after World War II and the Korean War, much of the existing Korean forests were cut down, which led to problems with flooding and soil erosion. Combination of reforestation efforts (e.g. Arbor Day was celebrated as a national holiday starting in 1949) and policies designed to reduce the use of firewood as a source of energy (e.g. restriction of inflow of firewood into Seoul and other major cities starting in 1958) helped to spark a recovery in the 1950s. Comprehensive reforestation programs starting in the 1970s and continuing into the late 1990s aided in an acceleration of forest volume increase, and the forest cover reached a peak of 65% of national land area in 1980 as opposed to a low of 35% in 1955.

News that North Korea was constructing a huge multipurpose dam at the base of Geumgangsan () north of the DMZ caused considerable consternation in South Korea during the mid-1980s. During 1987 the Geumgangsan Dam was a major issue that Seoul sought to raise in talks with Pyongyang. Though Seoul completed a &quot;Peace Dam&quot; on the Pukhan River to counteract the potential threat of Pyongyang&#x27;s dam project before the 1988 Olympics, the North Korean project still was in its initial stages of construction in 1990.

==Climate==

Part of the East Asian Monsoon region, South Korea has humid continental and humid subtropical climates, with four distinct seasons. The movement of air masses from the Asian continent exerts a greater influence on South Korea&#x27;s weather than does air movement from the Pacific Ocean. Winters are usually long, cold, and dry, whereas summers are short, hot, and humid. Spring and autumn are pleasant but short in duration. Seoul&#x27;s mean temperature in January is ; in July the mean temperature is about . Because of its southern and seagirt location, Jeju Island has warmer and milder weather than other parts of South Korea. Mean temperatures on Jeju range from in January to in July.

The country generally has sufficient rainfall to sustain its agriculture. Rarely does less than of rainfall fall in any given year; for the most part, rainfall is over . Amounts of precipitation, however, can vary from year to year. Serious droughts occur about once every eight years, especially in the rice-producing southwestern part of the country. About two-thirds of the annual precipitation occurs between June and September.

South Korea is less vulnerable to typhoons than Japan, Taiwan, the east coast of China, or the Philippines. From one to three typhoons can be expected per year. Typhoons usually pass over South Korea in late summer, especially in August, and bring torrential rains. Flooding occasionally causes considerable damage, as do landslides, given the country&#x27;s generally mountainous terrain.

In September 1984, record floods caused the deaths of 190 people and left 200,000 homeless. This disaster prompted the North Korean government to make an unprecedented offer of humanitarian aid in the form of rice, medicine, clothes, and building materials. South Korea accepted these items and distributed them to flood victims.



=== Rainy season ===

The rainy season of South Korea refers to a phenomenon in which it rains continuously for several days in summer or rainy season, or the weather, or the rain itself. On average, the rainy season is 30 to 35 days, but it does not continue to rain during this period. In fact, it rains for about 15 to 20 days, and among them, it falls only for about 12 to 16 days due to the stagnant front. However, the rainy season varies greatly from year to year. The rainy season is a representative summer weather in East Asian countries, including the Republic of Korea, and accounts for more than 30% of the precipitation on the Korean Peninsula. For this reason, some call the rainy season the &quot;fifth season.&quot; 
It is usually a form of torrential rain that pours suddenly and then stops. In particular, the recent rainy season is referred to as a &quot;nocturnal rainy season,&quot; and it is often in the form of a lull during the day, and local heavy rain pouring down at night. In the case of cloudy days, the upper layer may be heated rather than the ground during the day, and at night, the clouds trap the heat of the lower layer while the upper layer cools, so convection develops. In fact, considering that showers come during the day, nights account for a high percentage of 55%. 
A distinct congestion front is created between the cold and humid Okhotsk Sea air mass located on the northern Russian coast and the hot and humid North Pacific air mass near the Ogasawara Islands, resulting in a rainy season. However, in the case of the Korean Peninsula, not only the Okhotsk Sea air mass but also the cold and dry Siberian air mass contributes to the rainy season. Another cause of the rainy season is said to be the Bering Sea and the Tibetan Plateau. To be exact, the speed of high pressure formation varies depending on the amount of ice in the Bering Sea and the amount of snow accumulated in the Tibetan Plateau, as the rainy season begins with the speed at which each high pressure in the north and south of the Korean Peninsula moves. For this reason, rainy seasons are regarded as a kind of East Asian seasonal wind climate abroad. 
The rainy season ends when the North Pacific high pressure expands and the Okhotsk Sea fleet retreats. Since then, as the North Pacific high pressure began to dominate the Korean Peninsula, the heat wave began in earnest and entered the middle of summer. However, during the period from summer to autumn, as the North Pacific high pressure contracts and cold air expands in the north, the stagnant front moves south again and settles near the Korean Peninsula, which is called the &quot;Autumn rainy season&quot; or &quot;second rainy season.&quot; The autumn rainy season generally occurs between late August and early September, and although it is usually shorter than the early summer rainy season, it sometimes pours more rain than the summer rainy season.

Due to severe climate change caused by global warming in India, daytime temperatures have risen to 32 degrees Celsius since mid-April and 39 degrees in late April, resulting in a strong heat wave in mid-summer, which also hit Korea in early June 2022.

The head of the Korea Meteorological Administration pointed out in 2022 that it was impossible to predict the recent heavy rain, and that the traditional expression of &quot;rainy season&quot; now seems to have expired.

=== Yellow dust ===

Asian Dust, known in Korea as the Yellow Dust, refers to a phenomenon in which when low pressure passes through the desert area of China, a large amount of yellow dust floats in the air or lands on the move due to strong winds and topography, affecting Korea. Yellow Dust occurs in desert areas in China and Mongolia, and the addition of several conditions to the sand particles generated here affects South Korea. Deserts where Yellow dust usually occurs include Taklamakan, Ordos, and Gobi. In South Korea, Yellow Dust usually occurs in spring, especially in April. Yellow dust has been recorded since ancient times, and the damage was not so severe because it was only a sandstorm in ancient times, but in modern times, the damage is getting worse due to China&#x27;s rapid industrialization and desertification.

In summer or autumn, the roots of rain and plants play a role in holding onto the sand. However, in spring, the dry soil, which had been frozen throughout the winter, melts and breaks down into small pieces, resulting in small sand dust of less than 20 μm in size. When low pressure passes over the generated sand dust, it rises to a high sky of 3,000-5,000m by a strong ascending air current and then travels in westerlies and jets of about 30m per second. Since then, it has descended from Korea and Japan, where wind speed has slowed, and sometimes even moved to the United States (April 1998). It takes about two to three days to get to the Korean Peninsula from the origin.
In South Korea, Yellow Dust is observed for 3 to 6 days mainly from March to May every year. In terms of the total number of observations nationwide, Jeolla-do (Gwangju, the region with the largest number of occurrences) has been observed. In terms of the number of days of occurrence, Seoul, Gyeonggi and the west coast are long. In rare cases, it was observed in Seoul in the winter of 1991 (November 30, 1991 to December 3). Early yellow dust occurred on January 25, 1999, and severe yellow dust occurred around 1 p.m. on January 2, 2001.

However, there is also a strange tendency, such as yellow dust in December 2022 in winter.

=== Typhoons ===

South Korea is less vulnerable to typhoons than Japan, Taiwan, the east coast of China, or the Philippines. From one to three typhoons can be expected per year. Typhoons usually pass over South Korea in late summer, especially in August, and bring torrential rains. Flooding occasionally causes considerable damage, as do landslides, given the country&#x27;s generally mountainous terrain.
Typhoons often occur from midsummer to early autumn, July, August, and September. Most of the typhoons invading the Korean Peninsula are concentrated during this period, and sometimes indirect effects occur in June and October. Even October has a direct impact and lands.In the summer, the water on the surface of the ocean, which received hot heat, evaporates and rises by convection and condenses, and the latent heat released heats up the surrounding water vapor again to the troposphere interface.
In the case of typhoons heading to Korea, most of them fall into Japan, or Jeju Island, Gyeongsangnam-do, and Jeollanam-do are often directly damaged. However, In September 1984, record floods caused the deaths of 190 people and left 200,000 homeless. This disaster prompted the North Korean government to make an unprecedented offer of humanitarian aid in the form of rice, medicine, clothes, and building materials. South Korea accepted these items and distributed them to flood victims.
As global warming progresses, the power of typhoons is likely to become stronger. In fact, hurricanes that occur in the Atlantic Ocean, where the average water temperature is 1 to 2 degrees higher than in the Pacific Ocean, are causing much more intensive damage than typhoons in the Pacific Ocean. Since 2013, the typhoon season has been delayed due to climate change, reducing summer typhoons and increasing autumn typhoons. The season came in October 2013, 2020, and November 2019. As a result, the number of super typhoons is increasing.

==Resources and land use==

==Environmental concerns==
===Natural hazards===
There are occasional big typhoons that bring high winds and floods. There is also low-level seismic activity, which is common in the southwest.

====Volcanism and Earthquakes====

Unlike Japan or the northern provinces of China, the Korean Peninsula is geologically stable. There are no active volcanoes (aside from Baekdu Mountain on the border between North Korea and China, most recently active in 1903), and there have been no strong earthquakes. Historical records, however, describe volcanic activity on Mount Halla during the Goryeo Dynasty.

Hallasan (elev. ) is considered historically active although it has not erupted in many centuries. Earthquake activity is minimal; however, since 2016, there have been two earthquakes over 5.4 magnitude. Records of historical periods of Korean history (27AD to 1904), alongside data from surviving buildings, have been used to refine estimates for the severity of historical earthquakes both in and under the sea round the Korean peninsula.

===Environment===
====Current issues====
Habitat loss and degradation, especially of wetlands, through coastal reclamation (e.g. Saemangeum, Shiwa, Song Do, Namyang Bay, Asan Bay, in the south-west, Gwangyang Bay and the Nakdong Estuary) have caused huge declines in fisheries and of biodiversity. Most riverine wetland in Korea is now threatened by the proposed Grand Korean Waterway project. There are also some problems with air pollution in large cities; as well as water pollution from the discharge of sewage and industrial effluents. Drift netting is another issue.

====International agreements====
South Korea is a party to: Antarctic-Environmental Protocol, Antarctic-Marine Living Resources, Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution (MARPOL 73/78), Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands, Whaling

<text>Demographic features of the population of South Korea include population density, ethnicity, education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations, and other aspects of the population. The common language and especially culture are viewed as important elements by South Koreans in terms of identity, more than citizenship.

In June 2012, South Korea&#x27;s population reached 50 million, and by the end of 2016, South Korea&#x27;s population peaked at about 51 million people. However, in recent years the total fertility rate (TFR) of South Korea has plummeted, leading some researchers to suggest that if current trends continue, the country&#x27;s population will shrink to approximately 28 million people by the end of the 21st century. In 2018, fertility in South Korea became a topic of international debate after only 26,500 babies were born in October and an estimated 325,000 babies for the year, causing the country to achieve the lowest birth rate in the world. In a further indication of South Korea&#x27;s dramatic decline in fertility, in 2020 the country recorded more deaths than births, resulting in a population decline for the first time since modern records began.

Analysts have attributed South Korea&#x27;s population decline resulting from low birth rates to the country&#x27;s high economic inequality; including the high cost of living, low wages for an OECD member country, lack of job opportunities, as well as rising housing costs. South Korea also has the highest suicide rate in the OECD and the wider developed world.

In South Korea, a variety of different Asian people had migrated to the Korean Peninsula in past centuries, however few have remained permanently. South Korea is a highly homogenous nation, but has in recent decades become home to a number of foreign residents (4.37%), whereas North Korea has not experienced this trend. However, many of them are ethnic Koreans with a foreign citizenship. Many residents from China, post-Soviet states, the United States and Japan are, in fact, repatriated ethnic Koreans (labelled &quot;Overseas Koreans&quot;) who may meet criteria for expedited acquisition of South Korean citizenship. For example, migrants from China (PRC) make up 56.5% of foreign nationals, but approximately 70% of the Chinese citizens in Korea are (), PRC citizens of Korean ethnicity. The total population of Korea is estimated to be 80 million, which includes the population of North Korea.

==Population trends==


According to Worldometers&#x27; South Korea Population Forecast statistics, South Korea is supposed to have a 0.36% yearly change increase by 2020, a 0.28% yearly change increase by 2025, a 0.18% yearly change increase by 2030, and a 0.04% yearly change increase by 2035. According to those same statistics, the years from 2040 to 2050 are supposed to have a steady decline of yearly change percentages.

The population of South Korea showed robust growth since the republic&#x27;s establishment in 1948, and then dramatically slowed down with the effects of its economic growth. In the first official census, taken in 1949, the total population of South Korea was calculated at 20,188,641 people. The 1985 census total was 40,466,577. Population growth was slow, averaging about 1.1% annually during the period from 1949 to 1955, when the population registered at 21.5 million. Growth accelerated between 1955 and 1966 to 29.2 million or an annual average of 2.8%, but declined significantly during the period 1966 to 1985 to an annual average of 1.7%. Thereafter, the annual average growth rate was estimated to be less than 1%, similar to the low growth rates of most industrialized countries and to the target figure set by the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs for the 1990s. As of January 1, 1989, the population of South Korea was estimated to be approximately 42,200,000 

The proportion of the total population under fifteen years of age has risen and fallen with the growth rate. In 1955 approximately 41.2% of the population was under fifteen years of age, a percentage that rose to 43.5% in 1966 before falling to 38.3% in 1975, 34.2% in 1980, and 29.9% in 1985. In the past, the large proportion of children relative to the total population put great strains on the country&#x27;s economy, particularly because substantial resources were invested in education facilities. With the slowdown in the population growth rate and a rise in the median age (from 18.7 years to 21.8 years between 1960 and 1980), the age structure of the population has begun to resemble the columnar pattern typical of developed countries, rather than the pyramidal pattern found in most parts of the Third World.

The decline in the population growth rate and in the proportion of people under fifteen years of age after 1966 reflected the success of official and unofficial birth control programs. The government of President Syngman Rhee (1948–60) was conservative in such matters. Although Christian churches initiated a family planning campaign in 1957, it was not until 1962 that the government of Park Chung Hee, alarmed at the way in which the rapidly increasing population was undermining economic growth, began a nationwide family planning program. Other factors that contributed to a slowdown in population growth included urbanization, later marriage ages for both men and women, higher education levels, a greater number of women in the labor force, and better health standards.

Public and private agencies involved in family planning included the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Planned Parenthood Federation of Korea, and the Korea Institute of Family Planning. In the late 1980s, their activities included distribution of free birth control devices and information, classes for women on family planning methods, and the granting of special subsidies and privileges (such as low-interest housing loans) to parents who agreed to undergo sterilization. There were 502,000 South Koreans sterilized in 1984, as compared with 426,000 in the previous year.

The 1973 Maternal and Child Health Law legalized abortion. In 1983 the government began suspending medical insurance benefits for maternal care for pregnant women with three or more children. It also denied tax deductions for education expenses to parents with two or more children.

As in China, cultural attitudes posed problems for family planning programs. A strong preference for sons—who in Korea&#x27;s traditional Confucian value system are expected to care for their parents in old age and carry on the family name—means that parents with only daughters usually continued to have children until a son is born. The government encouraged married couples to have only one child. This has been a prominent theme in public service advertising, which stresses &quot;have a single child and raise it well.&quot;

Total fertility rates (the average number of births a woman will have during her lifetime) fell from 6.1 births per female in 1960 to 4.2 in 1970, 2.8 in 1980, and 2.4 in 1984. The number of live births, recorded as 711,810 in 1978, grew to a high of 917,860 in 1982. This development stirred apprehensions among family planning experts of a new &quot;baby boom.&quot; By 1986, however, the number of live births had declined to 806,041.

Decline in population growth continued, and between 2005 and 2010 total fertility rate for South Korean women was 1.21, one of the world&#x27;s lowest according to the United Nations. Fertility rate well below the replacement level of 2.1 births per female has triggered a national alarm, with some predicting an aging society unable to grow or support its elderly. Recent Korean governments have prioritized the issue on its agenda, promising to enact social reforms that will encourage women to have children.

The country&#x27;s population increased to 46 million by the end of the twentieth century, with growth rates ranging between 0.9% and 1.2%. The population is expected to stabilize (that is, cease to grow) in the year 2023 at around 52.6 million people. In the words of &quot;Asiaweek&quot; magazine, the &quot;stabilized tally will approximate the number of Filipinos in 1983, but squeezed into less than a third of their [the Philippines&#x27;] space.&quot;

As of early 2019, the birth rate of South Korea reached a very low number. In February 2019, the Korean TFR fell to 0.98, well below the replacement level of 2.1 births. South Korea is now the fastest aging developed country in the world. The Korean government (and their failing actions against the birth rate issue) and the worsening economic environment for young people are blamed as the main cause.


===Population settlement patterns===

South Korea is one of the world&#x27;s most densely populated countries, with an estimated 425 people per square kilometer in 1989—over sixteen times the average population density of the United States in the late 1980s. By comparison, China had an estimated 114 people, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) 246 people, and Japan 323 people per square kilometer in the late 1980s. Because about 70% of South Korea&#x27;s land area is mountainous and the population is concentrated in the lowland areas, actual population densities were in general greater than the average. As early as 1975, it was estimated that the density of South Korea&#x27;s thirty-five cities, each of which had a population of 50,000 or more inhabitants, was 3,700 people per square kilometer. Because of continued migration to urban areas, the figure was higher in the late 1980s.

In 1988 Seoul had a population density of 17,030 people per square kilometer as compared with 13,816 people per square kilometer in 1980. The second largest city, Busan, had a density of 8,504 people per square kilometer in 1988 as compared with 7,272 people in 1980. Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds the capital and contains Incheon, the country&#x27;s fourth largest city, was the most densely populated province; Gangwon Province in the northeast was the least densely populated province.

According to the government&#x27;s Economic Planning Board, the population density will be 530 people per square kilometer by 2023, the year the population is expected to stabilize.

Rural areas in South Korea consist of agglomerated villages in river valleys and range from a few houses to several hundred. These villages are located in the south that are backed by hills and give strong protection from winter winds.

Since 1960, the pace of urbanization in South Korea has hit a considerable decline in population of rural areas and the traditional rural lifestyle has been slowly fading away.

===Fertility===

In the past 20 years, South Korea has recorded some of the lowest fertility and marriage levels in the world. As of 2020, it is the country with the world&#x27;s lowest total fertility rate—0.84. Seoul has a TFR of 0.64, probably the lowest level anywhere in the world.

Low birth rates have discouraged South Korean doctors from entering pediatrics out of the fear that the field has no future. Due to how medical insurance is structured in South Korea, pediatric care relies especially on volume to compensate for its low reimbursement rates. The number of pediatric facilities in Seoul fell by 12.5 percent between 2018 and 2022, compared to an increase of 76.8 percent for psychiatry clinics and a 41.2 percent rise for anesthesiology centers. Conditions such as overcrowded waiting rooms and a shortage of hospital beds have led to the death of at least one child. The difficulty in obtaining pediatric care is causing many South Korean couples to reconsider having babies.

===Age structure===

Population of South Korea by age and sex (demographic pyramid)





South Korea faces the problem of a rapidly aging population. In fact, the speed of aging in Korea is unprecedented in human history, 18 years to double aging population from 7–14% (fewest years), overtaking even Japan. Statistics support this observation, the percentage of elderly aged 65 and above, has sharply risen from 3.3% in 1955 to 10.7% in 2009. The shape of its population has changed from a pyramid in the 1990s, with more young people and fewer old people, to a diamond shape in 2010, with less young people and a large proportion of middle-age individuals.

There are several implications and issues associated with an aging population. A rapidly aging population is likely to have several negative implications on the labour force. In particular, experts predict that this might lead to a shrinking of the labour force. As an increasing proportion of people enter their 50s and 60s, they either choose to retire or are forced to retire by their companies. As such, there would be a decrease in the percentage of economically active people in the population. Also, with rapid aging, it is highly likely that there would be an imbalance in the young-old percentage of the workforce. This might lead to a lack of vibrancy and innovation in the labour force, since it is helmed mainly by the middle-age workers. Data shows that while there are fewer young people in society, the percentage of economically active population, made up of people ages 15–64, has gone up by 20% from 55.5% to 72.5%. This shows that the labour force is indeed largely made up of middle-aged workers.

A possible consequence might be that South Korea would be a less attractive candidate for investment. Investors might decide to relocate to countries like Vietnam, where there is an abundance of cheaper, younger labour. If employers were to choose to maintain operations in South Korea, there is a possibility that they might incur higher costs in retraining or upgrading the skills of this group of middle-age workers. On top of that, higher healthcare costs might also be incurred and the government would need to set aside more money to maintain a good healthcare system to cater to the elderly.

Due to the very low birth rate, South Korea is predicted to enter a Russian Cross pattern once the large generation born in the 1960s starts to die off, with potentially decades of population decline.

Since 2016, the number of elderly people (+65 years old) outnumbered children (0–14 years) and the country became an &quot;aged society&quot;. People older than 65 make up more than 14% of the total population.

===Urbanization===
Like other newly industrializing economies, South Korea experienced rapid growth of urban areas caused by the migration of large numbers of people from the countryside. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Seoul, by far the largest urban settlement, had a population of about 190,000 people. There was a striking contrast with Japan, where Edo (Tokyo) had as many as 1 million inhabitants and the urban population comprised as much as 10% to 15% of the total during the Tokugawa Period (1600–1868). During the closing years of the Joseon dynasty and the first years of Japanese colonial rule, the urban population of Korea was no more than 3% of the total. After 1930, when the Japanese began industrial development on the Korean Peninsula, particularly in the northern provinces adjacent to Manchuria, the urban portion of the population began to grow, reaching 11.6% for all of Korea in 1940.

Between 1945 and 1985, the urban population of South Korea grew from 14.5% to 65.4% of the total population. In 1988 the Economic Planning Board estimated that the urban portion of the population will reach 78.3% by the end of the twentieth century. Most of this urban increase was attributable to migration rather than to natural growth of the urban population. Urban birth rates have generally been lower than the national average. The extent of urbanization in South Korea, however, is not fully revealed in these statistics. Urban population was defined in the national census as being restricted to those municipalities with 50,000 or more inhabitants. Although many settlements with fewer than 50,000 inhabitants were satellite towns of Seoul or other large cities or mining communities in northeastern Gangwon Province, which would be considered urban in terms of the living conditions and occupations of the inhabitants, they still were officially classified as rural.

The dislocation caused by the Korean War accounted for the rapid increase in urban population during the early 1950s. Hundreds of thousands of refugees, many of them from North Korea, streamed into the cities. During the post-Korean War period, rural people left their ancestral villages in search of greater economic and educational opportunities in the cities. By the late 1960s, migration had become a serious problem, not only because cities were terribly overcrowded, but also because the rural areas were losing the most youthful and productive members of their labor force.

In 1970, the Park Chung Hee government launched the Saemaul Undong (New Community Movement) as a rural reconstruction and self-help movement to improve economic conditions in the villages, close the wide gap in income between rural and urban areas, and stem urban migration—as well as to build a political base. Despite a huge amount of government sponsored publicity, especially during the Park era, it was not clear by the late 1980s that the Saemaul undong had achieved its objectives. By that time many, if not most, farming and fishing villages consisted of older persons; relatively few able-bodied men and women remained to work in the fields or to fish. This trend was apparent in government statistics for the 1986–87 period: the proportion of people fifty years old or older living in farming communities grew from 28.7% in 1986 to 30.6% in 1987, while the number of people in their twenties living in farming communities declined from 11.3% to 10.8%. The nationwide percentages for people fifty years old or older and in their twenties were, in 1986, 14.9% and 20.2%, respectively.

In 1985 the largest cities were Seoul (9,645,932 inhabitants), Busan (3,516,807), Daegu (2,030,672), Incheon (1,387,491), Gwangju (906,129), and Daejeon (866,695). According to government statistics, the population of Seoul, one of the world&#x27;s largest cities, surpassed 10 million people in late 1988. Seoul&#x27;s average annual population growth rate during the late 1980s was more than 3%. Two-thirds of this growth was attributable to migration rather than to natural increase. Surveys revealed that &quot;new employment or seeking a new job,&quot; &quot;job transfer,&quot; and &quot;business&quot; were major reasons given by new immigrants for coming to the capital. Other factors cited by immigrants included &quot;education&quot; and &quot;a more convenient area to live.&quot;

To alleviate overcrowding in Seoul&#x27;s downtown area, the city government drew up a master plan in the mid-1980s that envisioned the development of four &quot;core zones&quot; by 2000: the original downtown area, Yongdongpo-Yeouido, Yongdong, and Jamsil. Satellite towns also would be established or expanded. In the late 1980s, statistics revealed that the daytime or commuter population of downtown Seoul was as much as six times the officially registered population. If the master plan is successful, many commuters will travel to work in a core area nearer their homes, and the downtown area&#x27;s daytime population will decrease. Many government ministries have been moved out of Seoul, and the army, navy, and air force headquarters have been relocated to Daejeon.

In 1985 the population of Seoul constituted 23.8% of the national total. Provincial cities, however, experienced equal and, in many cases, greater expansion than the capital. Growth was particularly spectacular in the southeastern coastal region, which encompasses the port cities of Busan, Masan, Yosu, Jinhae, Ulsan, and Pohang. Census figures show that Ulsan&#x27;s population increased eighteenfold, growing from 30,000 to 551,300 inhabitants between 1960 and 1985. With the exception of Yosu, all of these cities are in South Gyeongsang Province, a region that has been an especially favored recipient of government development projects. By comparison, the population of Gwangju, capital of South Jeolla Province, increased less than threefold between 1960 and 1985, growing from 315,000 to 906,129 inhabitants.

Rapid urban growth has brought familiar problems to developed and developing countries alike. The construction of large numbers of high-rise apartment complexes in Seoul and other large cities alleviated housing shortages to some extent. But it also imposed hardship on the tens of thousands of people who were obliged to relocate from their old neighborhoods because they could not afford the rents in the new buildings. In the late 1980s, squatter areas consisting of one-story shacks still existed in some parts of Seoul. Housing for all but the wealthiest was generally cramped. The concentration of factories in urban areas, the rapid growth of motorized traffic, and the widespread use of coal for heating during the severe winter months caused dangerous levels of air and water pollution, issues that still persist today even after years of environmentally friendly policies.

In 2016, 82.59 percent of South Korea&#x27;s total population lived in urban areas and cities.

==Ethnic groups==
South Korea is a largely ethnically homogeneous country with an absolute majority of the Korean ethnicity from estimates but the country itself does collect ethnic or racial data formally. However, with its emergence as an economic powerhouse, demand for foreign immigrants increased and in 2007 the number of foreign citizen residents in South Korea passed the one million mark for the first time in history, and the number reached 2 million in 2016. Of those, 1,016,000 came from China, with more than half of them being ethnic Koreans of Chinese citizenship. The next largest group was from Vietnam with 149,000 residents. The third largest group was from the United States with 117,000 residents, excluding the American troops stationed in the country. Thailand, Philippines, Kazakhstan and other countries followed. Many of the foreign residents from China and the former Soviet Union, including Russia and Kazakhstan, are ethnic Koreans (see Koreans in China, Koryo-saram).

=== Chinese in South Korea ===
Since The People&#x27;s Republic of China and South Korea established their diplomatic relationship in 1992, the number of Chinese immigrants, majorly Joseonjok, has continued to increase. In the early 1990s, a trade agreement allowed merchants from China to conduct business trades in South Korea. There are also Chaoxianzu in Korea: Chinese nationals of Korean ethnicity living in South Korea.

=== North Americans in South Korea === 
South Korea is a country with one of the largest American immigrant populations in the world, numbering over 100,000. Most Americans tend to be Korean Americans who have returned to South Korea. About 43,000 Korean Americans reported living in South Korea in 2020, more than twice the number in 2005. South Korea also has a Canadian population of over 20,000.

=== Vietnamese in South Korea ===
The relationship between Vietnamese and Koreans date back to when Lý Dương Côn left for &quot;Goryeo&quot; after succession of power dispute. Likewise in 1226, Lý Long Tường, a prince of the Lý dynasty of Đại Việt (in modern-day Vietnam), later became &quot;Lee Yong-sang&quot; (이용상) of Hwasan, a general of Korea. He is an ancestor of one branch of the Lee (or Rhee) family today in South Korea. Nowadays, most Vietnamese immigrants are either manual labor workers, marriage immigrants, or cooks in Vietnamese cuisines.

=== Filipinos in South Korea ===
Relationship between Filipinos and South Koreans can be traced back to 1950s during the Korean War. Over 7,500 Filipino soldiers fought on the United Nations&#x27; side to help South Korea. As of 2019, there were more than 55,000 Filipino immigrants living in South Korea. Population decline in rural regions led to shortage of young people especially young women in those areas and it led many Koreans to marry Filipino brides.

=== Multiracial People in South Korea ===
==Languages==

The Korean language is the native language spoken by the vast majority of the population. English is widely taught in both public and private schools as a foreign language. However, general fluency in English in the country is relatively low compared to other industrialized developed countries. There is a Chinese minority who speak Mandarin and Cantonese. Some elderly may still be able to speak Japanese, which was de facto (1910–1938) and de jure (1938–1945) official during the Japanese rule in Korea.

In different areas of South Korea, different dialects are spoken. For example, the Gyeongsang dialect spoken around Busan and Daegu to the south is often perceived to sound quite rough and aggressive compared to standard Korean. 

==Religion==

Koreans have historically lived under the religious influences of Korean shamanism, Buddhism, Daoism, or Confucianism.

Korea is a country where three of the world&#x27;s major religions, Christianity, Buddhism, and Confucianism, peacefully coexist. According to 2015 statistics, 43.1% of Korean population has a religion and 2008 statistics show that over 510 religious organizations were in the South Korea population.

*Irreligious: 51%
*Christianity: 31%
*Buddhism: 17%
*Other religions: 1%

==Migration==

===Emigration===

Large-scale emigration from Korea began around 1904 and continued until the end of World War II. During the Japanese rule, many Koreans emigrated to Manchuria (present-day China&#x27;s northeastern provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang), other parts of China, the Soviet Union, Hawaii, and the contiguous United States.

Most emigrated for economic reasons; employment opportunities were scarce, and many Korean farmers lost their land after the Japanese introduced a system of land registration and private land tenure, imposed higher land taxes, and promoted the growth of an absentee landlord class charging exorbitant rents. Koreans from the northern provinces of Korea migrated mainly to Manchuria, China, and Siberia. Most people from the southern provinces went to Japan or the United States. Koreans were conscripted into Japanese labor battalions or the Japanese army, especially during World War II. In the 1940–44 period, nearly 2 million Koreans lived in Japan, 1.4 million in Manchuria, 600,000 in Siberia, and 130,000 in China. An estimated 40,000 Koreans were scattered among other countries, mainly the United States. At the end of World War II, approximately 2 million Koreans were repatriated from Japan and Manchuria.

More than 4 million ethnic Koreans lived outside the peninsula during the early 1980s. The largest group, about 1.7 million people, lived in China, the descendants of the Korean farmers who had left the country during the Japanese occupation. Most had assumed Chinese citizenship. The Soviet Union had about 430,000 ethnic Koreans, known as the Koryo-saram, scattered in several Soviet republics.

By contrast, many of Japan&#x27;s approximately 700,000 Koreans had below-average standards of living. This situation occurred partly because of discrimination by the Japanese majority and partly because a large number of resident Koreans, loyal to the North Korean regime of Kim Il Sung, preferred to remain separate from and hostile to the Japanese mainstream. The pro–North Korea Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan) initially was more successful than the pro–South Korea Mindan (Association for Korean Residents in Japan) in attracting adherents among residents in Japan. Since diplomatic relations were established between Seoul and Tokyo in 1965, however, the South Korean government has taken an active role in promoting the interests of their residents in Japan in negotiations with the Japanese government. It also has provided subsidies to Korean schools in Japan and other community activities.

By the end of 1988, the South Korean diaspora was estimated at around two million people. North America was home to over 1.2 million. Smaller Korean communities formed in Australia (100,000), Central and South America (45,000), the Middle East (12,000), Western Europe (40,000), New Zealand (30,000), other Asian countries (27,000), and Africa (25,000). A limited number of South Korean government-sponsored migrants settled in Chile, Argentina, and other Latin American countries.

Because of South Korea&#x27;s rapid economic expansion, an increasing number of its citizens reside abroad on a temporary basis as business executives, technical personnel, foreign students, and construction workers. A large number of formerly expatriate South Koreans have returned to South Korea primarily because of the country&#x27;s much improved economic conditions and the difficulties they experienced in adjusting to living abroad.
=== Immigration ===
There are 2 650 783 foreign residents in South Korea as of December 2024, i.e. 5.18% of the total population. Roughly half of this population was Chinese (958,959), followed by Vietnamese (305,936), Thai (188,770) and American (170,251). Out of the total foreign population, 557,057 were short-term residents on fixed-term employment contracts. These figures exclude foreign-born citizens who have naturalized and obtained South Korean citizenship; the total number of naturalized South Korean citizens surpassed 200,000 in 2019. 

Fair amount of the foreign residents from some countries are Korean descendants. Two thirds of Chinese, half of Russian, one fourth of Uzbeks are repatriated ethnic Koreans (labelled &quot;Overseas Koreans&quot;) who may meet criteria for expedited acquisition of South Korean citizenship. They are Korean Chinese and Koryo-saram.
Also, sizeable number of migrants from countries with primarily multicultural immigrant population, such as Australia, Canada, United States, and Japan are also of Korean ethnic descent.

<text>The politics of South Korea take place in the framework of a presidential representative democratic republic, whereby the president is the head of state, and of a multi-party system. To ensure a separation of powers, the Republic of Korea Government is made up of three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. The government exercises executive power, and legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature and comprises a Supreme Court, appellate courts, and a Constitutional Court. 

Since 1948, the constitution has undergone five major revisions, each signifying a new republic. The current Sixth Republic began with the last major constitutional revision that took effect in 1988. From its founding until the June Democratic Struggle, the South Korean political system operated under a military authoritarian regime, with the freedom of assembly, association, expression, press and religion as well as civil society activism being tightly restricted. During that period, there were no freely elected national leaders, political opposition is suppressed, dissent was not permitted and civil rights were curtailed.

 According to the V-Dem Democracy indices in 2023, South Korea was the third most electoral democratic country in Asia. South Korea is often cited as a model of democracy due to its relatively peaceful and internally-driven democratic transition.

However, the mid-2000s to mid-2010s are often considered South Korea&#x27;s backsliding period. Although, some have argued South Korea has hit a democratic ceiling and changes are more characteristic of democratic stagnation in lieu of regression. This took the form of more state involvement (particularly through the Korea Communications Commission or KCC) in media control and less editorial independence among journalists with conservative media owners. Overall, political expression lagged behind comparable democracies. Additionally, South Korea has very strict election and campaign finance regulations, that includes no door-to-door canvassing and, consequently, some have cited these regulations as barriers to political expression and free and fair elections. These changes have largely attributed to South Korea&#x27;s weak political party structure that emphasizes leaders and, consequently, hyper-presidentialism. Moreover, a right-left ideological divide has been more deeply entrenched into South Korean political society. However, South Korea is considered to have a strong civil society or &quot;simin sahoe&quot; manifested through a large number of civic organizations that prevented further backsliding via the 2016-2017 Candlelight Demonstrations. 

Under more recent administrations such as President Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea has taken a stance as a &quot;Global Pivotal State,&quot; which involves a greater role in East Asia as a democratic power. Despite its own democratic struggles, South Korea has taken an active role on democracy on the global stage having hosted the 2024 Summit for Democracy and committing to &quot;strengthen coordination on promoting democracy and protecting human rights&quot; at the 2023 Camp David Summit with the U.S. and Japan, bolstering their trilateral relationship.

==National government==
===Executive branch===

|President
|Choi Sang-mok
|Independent
|27 December 2024
|Prime Minister
|Choi Sang-mok
|Independent
|27 December 2024

The head of state is the president, who is elected by direct popular vote for a single five-year term. The president is Commander-in-Chief of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces and enjoys considerable executive powers.

The president appoints the prime minister with approval of the National Assembly, as well as appointing and presiding over the State Council of chief ministers as the head of government. On 12 March 2004, the executive power of then President Roh Moo-hyun was suspended when the Assembly voted to impeach him and Prime Minister Goh Kun became an Acting President. On 14 May 2004, the Constitutional Court overturned the impeachment decision made by the Assembly and Roh was reinstated.

On 10 May 2022, Yoon Suk Yeol succeeded Moon Jae-in as president of South Korea.

===Legislative branch===
The National Assembly () has 300 members, elected for a four-year term, 253 members in single-seat constituencies and 47 members by proportional representation. The ruling Democratic Party of Korea is the largest party in the Assembly.

===Judicial branch===

The South Korean judiciary is independent of the other two branches of government, and is composed of two different highest courts. Inferior ordinary courts are under the Supreme Court, whose justices are appointed by the president of South Korea with the consent of the National Assembly. In addition, the Constitutional Court oversees questions of constitutionality, as single and the only court whose justices are appointed by the president of South Korea by equal portion of nomination from the president, the National Assembly, and the Supreme Court Chief justice. South Korea has not accepted compulsory ICJ jurisdiction.

==Political parties and elections==

South Korea elects on national level a head of state – the president – and a legislature. The president is elected for a five-year term by the people. The National Assembly (&quot;Gukhoe&quot;) has 300 members, elected for a four-year term, 253 members in single-seat constituencies and 47 members by proportional representation.

The main two political parties in South Korea are the liberal Democratic Party of Korea (lit. &quot;Together Democratic Party&quot;, DPK) and the conservative People Power Party (PPP), formerly the United Future Party (UFP). The liberal camp and the conservative camp are the dominant forces of South Korean politics at present.

===Political nature===
South Korea&#x27;s political history has always been prone to splits from and merges with other parties. One reason is that there is a greater emphasis around the &#x27;politics of the individual&#x27; rather than the party; therefore, party loyalty is not strong when disagreements occur. The graph below illustrates the extent of the political volatility within the last 10 years alone. These splits were intensified after the 2016 South Korean political scandal.

===Latest elections===

==== Presidential election ====
In March 2022, Yoon Suk-yeol, the candidate of the conservative opposition People Power Party, won a close election over Democratic Party candidate Lee Jae-myung by the narrowest margin ever. On 10 May 2022, Yoon was sworn in as South Korea&#x27;s new president.

<doc id="27024" wikidata="Q499208" url="?curid=27024" title="Economy of South Korea">
<text>The economy of South Korea is a highly developed mixed economy. By nominal GDP, the economy was worth (US$1.87 trillion). It has the 4th largest economy in Asia and the 12th largest in the world as of 2025. South Korea is notable for its rapid economic development from an underdeveloped nation to a developed, high-income country in a few decades. This economic growth has been described as the Miracle on the Han River, which has allowed it to join the OECD and the G20. It is included in the group of Next Eleven countries as having the potential to play a dominant role in the global economy by the middle of the 21st century. Among OECD members, South Korea has a highly efficient and strong social security system; social expenditure stood at roughly 15.5% of GDP. South Korea spends around 4.93% of GDP on advanced research and development across various sectors of the economy.

South Korea&#x27;s education system and the establishment of a motivated and educated populace were largely responsible for spurring the country&#x27;s high technology boom and economic development. South Korea began to adapt an export-oriented economic strategy to fuel its economy. In 2022, South Korea was the ninth largest exporter and ninth largest importer in the world. The Bank of Korea and the Korea Development Institute periodically release major economic indicators and economic trends of the economy of South Korea.

Renowned financial organisations, such as the International Monetary Fund, note the resilience of the South Korean economy against various economic crises. They cite the country&#x27;s economic advantages as reasons for this resilience, including low state debt and high fiscal reserves that can quickly be mobilised to address any expected financial emergencies. Other financial organisations, like the World Bank, describe South Korea as one of the fastest-growing major economies of the next generation, along with BRICS and Indonesia. South Korea was one of the few developed countries that was able to avoid a recession during the Great Recession. Its economic growth rate reached 6.2% in 2010, a recovery from economic growth rates of 2.3% in 2008 and 0.2% in 2009 during the Great Recession. The South Korean economy again recovered with the record surplus of US$70.7 billion at the end of 2013, up 47 percent growth from 2012. This growth contrasted with the uncertainties of the global economic turmoil, with the country&#x27;s major economic output being the technology products exports.

Despite the South Korean economy&#x27;s high growth and structural stability, South Korea is experiencing damage to its credit rating in the stock market due to North Korea in times of military crises. The recurring conflict affects the financial markets of its economy. The South Korean economy faces challenges due to a declining and ageing population, with a fertility rate among the lowest in the world.

==History==
===Overview===
Following the Korean War, South Korea remained a country with less developed markets for a little more than a decade. The growth of the industrial sector was the principal stimulus to South Korea&#x27;s economic development. In 1986, manufacturing industries accounted for approximately 30 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and 25 percent of the work force. Due to strong domestic encouragement and some foreign aid, Seoul&#x27;s industrialists introduced modern technologies into outmoded or newly built facilities, increased the production of commodities—especially those for sale in foreign markets—and plowed the proceeds back into further industrial expansion. As a result, industry altered South Korea&#x27;s landscape, drawing millions of labourers to urban manufacturing centres.

A downturn in the South Korean economy in 1989 spurred by a decrease in exports and foreign orders caused concern in the industrial sector. Ministry of Trade and Industry analysts stated that decreased export performance resulted from structural problems, including an overly strong won, increased wages and labour costs, frequent strikes, and higher interest rates. The result was an increase in inventories and cutbacks in production at a number of electronics, automobile, and textile manufacturers, as well as at the smaller firms that supplied the parts. Factory automation systems were introduced to reduce dependence on labour, to boost productivity with a smaller work force, and to improve competitiveness.

=== Colonial period ===
Japan colonized Korea, officially annexing it on 22 August 1910 as the Province of Choson. Japan encouraged an inflow of Japanese capital to Korea&#x27;s less developed economy. A large majority of major firms in Korea became Japanese owned and operated as a result, with key positions reserved for Japanese. Koreans were permitted to work in menial roles under harsh labor conditions. Most of Korea&#x27;s coal, iron, and crop production was shipped to Japan.

===Rapid growth from 1960s to 1980s===
Following the coup that brought General Park Chung Hee to power in 1961, which at first caused political instability and an economic crisis, a protectionist economic policy began, pushing a bourgeoisie that developed in the shadow of the State to reactivate the internal market. To promote development, a policy of export-oriented industrialisation was applied, closing the entry into the country of all kinds of foreign products, except raw materials. Agrarian reforms were carried out and Park nationalised the financial system to swell the powerful state arm, whose intervention in the economy was through five-year plans.

The spearhead was the chaebols, diversified family conglomerates such as Hyundai, Samsung, and LG Corporation, which received state incentives such as tax breaks, legality for their exploitation system and cheap or free financing: the state bank facilitated the planning of concentrated loans by item according to each five-year plan, and by economic group selected to lead it.

South Korea received donations from the United States due to the Cold War, and foreign economic and military support continued for some years. Chaebols started to dominate the domestic economy and, eventually, began to become internationally competitive. Under these chaebols, workers began to see their wages and working conditions improve, which increased domestic consumption. By the 1980s, the country rose from low income to middle income.

South Korea&#x27;s real GDP expanded by an average of more than 8 percent per year, from US$2.7 billion in 1962 to US$230 billion in 1989, breaking the trillion dollar mark in the early 2000s. Nominal GDP per capita grew from $103.88 in 1962 to $5,438.24 in 1989, reaching the $20,000 milestone in 2006. The manufacturing sector grew from 14.3 percent of the GNP in 1962 to 30.3 percent in 1987. Commodity trade volume rose from US$480 million in 1962 to a projected US$127.9 billion in 1990. The ratio of domestic savings to GNP grew from 3.3 percent in 1962 to 35.8 percent in 1989. In the early 1960s, South Korea&#x27;s rate of growth exceeded North Korea&#x27;s rate of growth in most industrial areas.

The most significant factor in rapid industrialisation was the adoption of an outward-looking strategy in the early 1960s. This strategy was particularly well-suited to that time because of South Korea&#x27;s low savings rate and small domestic market. The strategy promoted economic growth through labour-intensive manufactured exports, in which South Korea could develop a competitive advantage. Government initiatives played an important role in this process. Through the model of export-led industrialisation, the South Korean government incentivised corporations to develop new technology and upgrade productive efficiency to compete the global market. By adhering to state regulations and demands, firms were awarded subsidisation and investment support to develop their export markets in the evolving international arena. In addition, the inflow of foreign capital was encouraged to supplement the shortage of domestic savings. These efforts enabled South Korea to achieve growth in exports and subsequent increases in income.

Beginning in 1973, South Korea&#x27;s government used its National Investment Fund and the Korea Development Bank to invest large amounts of money into what Park Chung-hee&#x27;s government viewed as the six strategic industries: steel, non-ferrous metals, shipbuilding, industrial machinery, electronics, and petrochemicals. This developmental approach was frequently criticized at the time from outside Korea, including by the World Bank. The strategy was successful and ultimately also helped develop companies like Samsung and POSCO and reduced input costs for production in downstream industries as well.

By emphasising the industrial sector, Seoul&#x27;s export-oriented development strategy left the rural sector barely touched. The steel and shipbuilding industries in particular played key roles in developing South Korea&#x27;s economy during this time. Except for mining, most industries were located in the urban areas of the northwest and southeast. Heavy industries were located in the south of the country. Factories in Seoul contributed over 25 percent of all manufacturing value-added in 1978; taken together with factories in surrounding Gyeonggi Province, factories in the Seoul area produced 46 percent of all manufacturing that year. Factories in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province employed 48 percent of the nation&#x27;s 2.1 million factory workers. Increased income disparity between the industrial and agricultural sectors became a problem by the 1970s despite government efforts to raise farm income and improve rural areas 
In the early 1980s, in order to control inflation, a conservative monetary policy and tight fiscal measures were adopted. Growth of the money supply was reduced from the 30 percent level of the 1970s to 15 percent. During this time, Seoul froze its budget for a short while. Government intervention in the economy was greatly reduced and policies on imports and foreign investment were liberalised to promote competition. To reduce the imbalance between rural and urban sectors, Seoul expanded investments in public projects, such as roads and communications facilities, while further promoting farm mechanisation.

The measures implemented early in the decade, coupled with significant improvements in the world economy, helped the South Korea regain its lost momentum. South Korea achieved an average of 9.2 percent real growth between 1982 and 1987 and 12.5 percent between 1986 and 1988. The double-digit inflation of the 1970s was brought under control. Wholesale price inflation averaged 2.1 percent per year from 1980 through 1988; consumer prices increased by an average of 4.7 percent annually. Seoul achieved its first significant surplus in its balance of payments in 1986 and recorded a US$7.7 billion and a US$11.4 billion surplus in 1987 and 1988 respectively. This development permitted South Korea to begin reducing its level of foreign debt. The trade surplus for 1989, however, was only US$4.6 billion, and a small negative balance was projected for 1990.

===1990s and the Asian Financial Crisis===

For the first half of the 1990s, the South Korean economy continued a stable and strong growth in both private consumption and GDP. During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, after several other Asian currencies were attacked by speculators, the Korean won started to depreciate in October 1997. The problem was exacerbated due to non-performing loans at many of Korea&#x27;s merchant banks. By December 1997, the IMF had approved a US$21 billion loan, that would be part of a US$58.4 billion bailout plan. By January 1998, the government had shut down a third of Korea&#x27;s merchant banks. Throughout 1998, Korea&#x27;s economy would continue to shrink quarterly at an average rate of −6.65%. and South Korean chaebol Daewoo was dismantled by the government in 1999 due to debt problems. General Motors managed to purchase the motors division. Indian conglomerate Tata Group purchased the trucks and heavy vehicles division of Daewoo.

Actions by the South Korean government and debt swaps by international lenders contained the country&#x27;s financial problems. Much of South Korea&#x27;s recovery from the 1997 Asian financial crisis can be attributed to labour adjustments (i.e. a dynamic and productive labour market with flexible wage rates) and alternative funding sources. By the first quarter of 1999, GDP growth had risen to 5.4%, and strong growth thereafter combined with deflationary pressure on the currency led to a yearly growth of 10.5%. In December 1999, President Kim Dae-jung declared the currency crisis over.

===2000s===
South Korea&#x27;s economy moved away from a centrally planned, government-directed investment model toward a more market-oriented one. These economic reforms, pushed by President Kim Dae-jung, helped South Korea maintain one of Asia&#x27;s few expanding economies, with growth rates of 10.8% in 1999 and 9.2% in 2000. Growth fell back to 3.3% in 2001 because of the slowing global economy, decreased exports, and perceptions that corporate and financial reforms have stalled.

After the bounce back from the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the economy continued strong growth in 2000 with a GDP growth of 9.08%. However, the South Korean economy was affected by the September 11 attacks. The slowing global economy, falling exports, and the perception that corporate and financial reforms had stalled caused growth to decrease to 3.8% in 2001 Thanks to industrialisation GDP per hour worked (labour output) more than tripled from US$2.80 in 1963 to US$10.00 in 1989. More recently the economy stabilised and maintain a growth rate between 4–5% from 2003 onwards.

Led by industry and construction, growth in 2002 was 5.8%, despite anemic global growth. The restructuring of chaebols, bank privatisation, and the creation of a more liberalised economy—with a mechanism for bankrupt firms to exit the market—remain an unfinished reform task. Growth slowed in 2003, but production expanded 5% in 2006, due to popular demand for key export products such as HDTVs and mobile phones.

Like most industrialised economies, South Korea experienced setbacks during the Great Recession. Growth fell by 3.4% in the fourth quarter of 2008 from the previous quarter, the first negative quarterly growth in 10 years, with year on year quarterly growth continuing to be negative into 2009. Many sectors of the economy at the time reported declines, with manufacturing dropping 25.6% as of January 2009, and consumer goods sales dropping 3.1%. Exports in autos and semiconductors, two pillars of the economy, shrank 55.9% and 46.9% respectively, while exports overall fell by a record 33.8% in January, and 18.3% in February 2009 year on year. As in the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Korean currency also experienced massive fluctuations, declining by 34% against the US dollar. Annual growth in the economy slowed to 2.3% in 2008, and was expected to drop to as low as −4.5% by Goldman Sachs, but South Korea was able to limit the downturn to a standstill at 0.2% in 2009. Despite the Great Recession, the South Korean economy, helped by timely stimulus measures and strong domestic consumption of products that compensated for decreased exports, was able to avoid a recession unlike most industrialised economies, posting positive economic growth for two consecutive years of the crisis. In 2010, South Korea made an economic rebound with a growth rate of 6.1%, signaling a return of the economy to pre-crisis levels. South Korea&#x27;s export has recorded $424 billion in the first eleven months of the year 2010, already higher than its export in the whole year of 2008. The South Korean economy of the 21st century, as a Next Eleven economy, is expected to grow from 3.9% to 4.2% annually between 2011 and 2030, similar to growth rates of developing countries such as Brazil or Russia.

The South Korean government signed the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement (KAFTA) on 5 December 2013, with the Australian government seeking to benefit its industries—including automotive, services, and resources and energy—and position itself alongside competitors, such as the U.S. and ASEAN. South Korea is Australia&#x27;s third largest export market and fourth largest trading partner with a 2012 trade value of A$32 billion. The agreement contains an Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) clause that permits legal action from South Korean corporations against the Australian government if their trade rights are infringed upon.

The government cut the work week from six days to five in phases, from 2004 to 2011, depending on the size of the firm. The number of public holidays was expanded to 16 by 2013.

South Korean economy decreased in the first quarter of 2019, which happened to be its worst drop since the Great Recession. GDP declined a seasonally adjusted 0.3 percent from the previous quarter.

South Korea&#x27;s prices rose more than 6 percent in July compared with last year, the fastest jump in nearly a quarter century.

In July 2022, South Korea&#x27;s Consumer price index rose 6.3 percent, the highest rate since November 1998.

===High-tech industries in the 1990s and 2000s===
In 1990, South Korean manufacturers planned a shift in future production plans toward high-technology industries. In June 1989, panels of government officials, scholars, and business leaders held planning sessions on the production of such goods as new materials, mechatronics—including industrial robotics—bioengineering, microelectronics, fine chemistry, and aerospace. This shift in emphasis, however, did not mean an immediate decline in heavy industries such as automobile and ship production, which had dominated the economy in the 1980s.

South Korea relies upon exports to fuel the growth of its economy, with finished products such as electronics, textiles, ships, automobiles, and steel being some of its most important exports. Although the import market has liberalised in recent years, the agricultural market has remained protectionist due to disparities in the price of domestic agricultural products such as rice with the international market. As of 2005, the price of rice in South Korea was four times that of the average price of rice on the international market, and it was believed that opening the agricultural market would affect South Korean agricultural sector negatively. In late 2004, however, an agreement was reached with the WTO in which South Korean rice imports will gradually increase from 4% to 8% of consumption by 2014. In addition, up to 30% of imported rice will be made available directly to consumers by 2010, where previously imported rice was only used for processed foods. Following 2014, the South Korean rice market will be fully opened.

South Korea today is known as a Launchpad of a mature mobile market, where developers thrive in a market where few technology constraints exist. There is a growing trend of inventions of new types of media or apps, using the 4G and 5G internet infrastructure in South Korea. South Korea has today the infrastructures to meet a density of population and culture that has the capability to create strong local particularity.

===The economy after the COVID-19 pandemic===
South Korea faced a turning point in its economy in 2023. With the constant growth of mainland China&#x27;s manufacturing industry and the impact of COVID-19, South Korea&#x27;s manufacturing sector is experiencing a consistent decline. According to SP Global, South Korea&#x27;s export of manufactured goods to mainland China, one of the biggest trading partners of South Korea, had decreased by 4.4% in the fourth quarter of 2022 and by 31% in January 2023. On the other hand, their primary electronic manufacturing industry is facing a downturn. While information and communication technology maintained 34% of South Korea&#x27;s total 2022 exports, at the end of the year, it decreased to 24%. The government had to incur a massive fiscal spending in 2020, leading a rise in the fiscal deficit as projected in their budget. Moreover, their forecasted debt-to-GDP ratio jumped to 41.2% of GDP in 2020 from 37.1% of GDP in 2019. In 2021, the government unveiled a $29 billion extra budget to aid small businesses and boost employment. In 2024, the government forecasted debt-to-GDP ratio was 47.4% of GDP. 

With downturns in many manufacturing industries, South Korea has been facing a recession. Many economists state the reason for industries&#x27; slowdown as the deteriorating global condition. The inflation rate in South Korea is regularly rising, and the problems in the domestic economy, such as household debt, population problems, and productivity problems, are the key fiscal and monetary factors that hold South Korea&#x27;s economic growth.

Due to the sudden evolution of COVID-19, private consumption decreased, and a bottleneck in the supply sector occurred. With this situation, the Bank of Korea indicated that the consumer inflation rate rose about three percent after COVID-19 evolved. Assuming that South Korea&#x27;s interest rate was low compared to other countries, raising house prices and household debt became one of the problems in South Korea&#x27;s economy. To stabilise the inflated economy, the government has passed the &quot;Korean New Deal Program&quot; to invest 144 billion dollars. This expansionary fiscal policy promoted private consumption and increase the number of jobs. This expansionary fiscal stimulus is designed to recover the economic and social impact of COVID-19 from the existing climate and environmental dangers. The New Deal policy is divided explicitly into healthcare and green industries.

South Korea&#x27;s Ministry of Economy and Finance asserted the New Growth Strategy 4.0 in August 2023. The New Growth Strategy suggests projects for South Korea&#x27;s long term industry growth. The South Korean government advocates these policies as a New Growth 4.0 project, which aims to generate tangible outcomes in the future by setting the focus of policy and investments towards emerging industries. To achieve these goals, the strategy outlines the following key guidelines:

# Foster AI semiconductor industries and build up a collaborative ecosystem between businesses.
# Dominate the global market of the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) industry.
# Secure Clean Hydrogen Production Technology via Water Electrolysis.
# Advance Autonomous Driving Technologies.
# Promote the Battery Re-manufacturing and Reuse Markets.
# Expand the Private Sector-led My Data Based Services.
# Streamline the Ordering Process of Research Equipment or Facilities to Alleviate Administrative Burdens.

Besides this, South Korea is one of the countries with excellent healthcare systems, biomedical technology, and AI technology. While South Korea&#x27;s value in the medical industry is projected at around 6.7 billion dollars, the medical technology market is projected to reach 11.5 billion dollars. The annual projected growth rate of the medical industry is over 6%, which indicates a bright future for the industry. Many economists suggest that by adopting AI technology, South Korea will be a bio-medical industry-leading country. An article about the future data-driven healthcare industry in South Korea suggests that AI technology helps the medical industry provide customised medical services for patients and can utilise the benefits and costs.

===Economic inequality===
==Data==
The following table shows the main economic indicators in 1980–2021 (with IMF staff estimates in 2022–2027). Inflation below 5% is in green.

==Sectors==
===Shipbuilding===

During the 1970s and 1980s, South Korea became a leading producer of ships, including oil supertankers, and oil-drilling platforms. The country&#x27;s major shipbuilder was Hyundai, which built a 1-million-ton capacity drydock at Ulsan in the mid-1970s. Daewoo joined the shipbuilding industry in 1980 and finished a 1.2-million-ton facility at Okpo on Geoje Island, south of Busan, in mid-1981. The industry declined in the mid-1980s because of the oil glut and because of a worldwide recession. There was a sharp decrease in new orders in the late 1980s; new orders for 1988 totaled 3 million gross tons valued at US$1.9 billion, decreases from the previous year of 17.8 percent and 4.4 percent, respectively. These declines were caused by labour unrest, Seoul&#x27;s unwillingness to provide financial assistance, and Tokyo&#x27;s new low-interest export financing in support of Japanese shipbuilders. However, the South Korean shipping industry was expected to expand in the early 1990s because older ships in world fleets needed replacing. South Korea eventually became the world&#x27;s dominant shipbuilder with a 50.6% share of the global shipbuilding market as of 2008. Notable Korean shipbuilders are Hyundai Heavy Industries, Samsung Heavy Industries, Hanwha Ocean, and the now bankrupt STX Offshore &amp; Shipbuilding.

===Electronics===

Electronics is one of South Korea&#x27;s main industries. During the 1980s through the 2000s, South Korean companies such as Samsung, LG, and SK led South Korea&#x27;s growth. In 2017, 17.1% of South Korea&#x27;s exports were semiconductors produced by Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. Samsung and LG are also major producers in electronic devices such as televisions, smartphones, display, and computers.

===Automobile===
The automobile industry was one of South Korea&#x27;s major growth and export industries in the 1980s. By the late 1980s, the capacity of the South Korean motor industry had increased more than fivefold since 1984; it exceeded 1 million units in 1988. Total investment in car and car-component manufacturing was over US$3 billion in 1989. Total production (including buses and trucks) for 1988 totaled 1.1 million units, a 10.6 percent increase over 1987, and grew to an estimated 1.3 million vehicles (predominantly passenger cars) in 1989. Almost 263,000 passenger cars were produced in 1985—a figure that grew to approximately 846,000 units in 1989. In 1988 automobile exports totaled 576,134 units, of which 480,119 units (83.3 percent) were sent to the United States. Throughout most of the late 1980s, much of the growth of South Korea&#x27;s automobile industry was the result of a surge in exports; 1989 exports, however, declined 28.5 percent from 1988. This decline reflected sluggish car sales to the United States, especially at the less expensive end of the market, and labour strife at home. South Korea today has developed into one of the world&#x27;s largest automobile producers. The Hyundai Motor Group is South Korea&#x27;s largest automaker in terms of revenue, production units and worldwide presence.

===Mining===
Most of the mineral deposits in the Korean Peninsula are located in North Korea, with the South only possessing an abundance of tungsten and graphite. Coal, iron ore, and molybdenum are found in South Korea, but not in large quantities and mining operations are on a small scale. Much of South Korea&#x27;s minerals and ore are imported from other countries. Most South Korean coal is anthracite that is only used for heating homes and boilers.

In 2019, South Korea was the 3rd largest world producer of bismuth, the 4th largest world producer of rhenium, and the 10th largest world producer of sulfur.

===Construction===

Construction has been an important South Korean export industry since the early 1960s and remains a critical source of foreign currency and &quot;invisible&quot; export earnings. By 1981 overseas construction projects, most of them in the Middle East, accounted for 60 percent of the work undertaken by South Korean construction companies. Contracts that year were valued at US$13.7 billion. In 1988, however, overseas construction contracts totaled only US$2.6 billion (orders from the Middle East were US$1.2 billion), a 1 percent increase over the previous year, while new orders for domestic construction projects totaled US$13.8 billion, an 8.8 percent increase over 1987. South Korean construction companies therefore concentrated on the rapidly growing domestic market in the late 1980s. By 1989 there were signs of a revival of the overseas construction market: the Dong Ah Construction Company signed a US$5.3 billion contract with Libya to build the second phase (and other subsequent phases) of Libya&#x27;s Great Man-Made River Project, with a projected cost of US$27 billion when all 5 phases were completed. South Korean construction companies signed over US$7 billion of overseas contracts in 1989. South Korea&#x27;s largest construction companies include Samsung C&amp;T Corporation, which built some of the highest building&#x27;s and most noteworthy skyscrapers such as three consecutively world&#x27;s tallest buildings: the Petronas Towers, Taipei 101, and the Burj Khalifa.

===Armaments===
During the 1960s, South Korea was dependent on the United States to supply its armed forces, but after the elaboration of President Richard M. Nixon&#x27;s policy of Vietnamisation in the early 1970s, South Korea began to manufacture its own weapons.

Since the 1980s, South Korea has begun exporting military equipment and technology to boost its international trade. Some of its key military export projects include the T-155 Firtina self-propelled artillery for Turkey; the K11 air-burst rifle for the United Arab Emirates; the Bangabandhu class guided-missile frigate for Bangladesh; fleet tankers such as Sirius class for the navies of Australia, New Zealand, and Venezuela; Makassar class amphibious assault ships for Indonesia; and the KT-1 trainer aircraft for Turkey, Indonesia, and Peru.

South Korea also exports various core components of other countries&#x27; advanced military hardware. Those hardware include modern aircraft such as F-15K fighters and AH-64 attack helicopters which will be used by Singapore, whose airframes will be built by Korea Aerospace Industries in a joint-production deal with Boeing. In other major outsourcing and joint-production deals, South Korea has jointly produced the S-300 air defence system of Russia via Samsung Group, and will facilitate the sales of Mistral class amphibious assault ships to Russia that will be produced by STX Corporation. The deal was cancelled in 2014 due to Russia&#x27;s actions in Ukraine and the ships were sold to Egypt instead. South Korea&#x27;s defence exports were $1.03 billion in 2008 and $1.17 billion in 2009.

===Tourism===

In 2012, 11.1 million foreign tourists visited South Korea, making it one of the most visited countries in the world, up from 8.5 million in 2010. Many tourists from all around Asia visit South Korea which has been due to the rise of the Korean Wave (&quot;Hallyu&quot;).

Seoul is the principal tourist destination for visitors; popular tourist destinations outside of Seoul include Seorak-san national park, the historic city of Gyeongju, and semi-tropical Jeju Island.

==Trade statistics==

==Mergers and acquisitions==
Since 1991, there has been a steady upwards trend in South Korean M&amp;A until 2018 with only a short break around 2004. Since 1991, around 18,300 deals in, into or out of South Korea have been announced, which sum up to a total value of over 941 bil. USD. 2016 has been the year with the largest deal value (1,818 in bil. USD) and the most deals (82,3).

Target industries are distributed very evenly with no industry taking a larger share than 10%. The top three target industries are electronics (9.7%), semiconductors (9.1%) and metals and mining (7.7%). However, over 51% of the acquiring companies originate from the financial and brokerage sector.

<text>In [[South Korea]], telecommunications services improved dramatically in the 1980s with the assistance of foreign partners and as a result of the development of the electronics industry. The number of telephones in use in 1987 reached 9.2 million, a considerable increase from 1980, when there were 2.8 million subscribers (which, in turn, was four times the number of subscribers in 1972).

Radio, and in more recent years television, reached virtually every resident. By 1945 there were about 60,000 radio sets in the country. By 1987 there were approximately 42 million radio receivers in use, and more than 100 radio stations were broadcasting. Transistor radios and television sets have made their way to the most remote rural areas. Television sets, now mass-produced in South Korea, became far less expensive; most city people and a significant number of rural families owned or had access to a television. Ownership of television sets grew from 25,000 sets when broadcasting was initiated in 1961 to an estimated 8.6 million sets in 1987, and more than 250 television stations were broadcasting.

===IT and Broadband Development===

Today, South Korea has the highest number of broadband users. The rapid growth of the Korean broadband market was the result of a combination of government pushes and market factors. The government was active in promoting privatization and deregulation in general, and the information technology (IT) sector was no exception.

The government implemented structural reforms in July 1990. Since the mid-1990s, the Ministry of Information and Communications (MIC) has pursued a policy of high-speed telecommunication infrastructure as a foundation to build a “knowledge-based society.” In the telecommunications sector, competition was allowed on an incremental basis and, in the market for value added services, full competition was allowed. In March 1995, Korea Information Infrastructure (KII) was established. KII&#x27;s goal was to advance the nation&#x27;s IT infrastructure. In August 1995, the Framework Act on Information Promotion was enacted.

The country then experienced economic crisis in 1997 with the rest of the region. During the economic reforms being implemented after the financial crisis, the information technology (IT) sector was one of several that was targeted and considered to be an important factor in the recovery of the nation&#x27;s economy. In 1999, the government implemented the program known as Cyber Korea 21, which was intended to accelerate IT development.

In 1999, the government provided US$77 million in loans with preferential rates to facilities service providers (FSP). In 2000, another US$77 million was provided in loans for suburban areas, small cities and towns, and regional industrial areas. Another US$926 million was provided until 2005 in order to supply the rural areas with broadband.

Commensurate with its investment funding, the government implemented various policies designed to increase internet use among the general population. The government provided “internet literacy” lessons to homemakers, the elderly, military personnel, and farmers. In June 2000, the government implemented what was known as the “Ten Million People Internet Education” project, the purpose of which was to provide internet education to ten million people.

The number of broadband subscribers in Korea reached 10 million in October 2002, with about 70% out of 14.3 million homes connected at the speed of over 2 Mbit/s.

In 2002, there were six operators providing broadband services in Korea. The market share leader was Korea Telecom (KT), with approximately 45.8% market share (4.5 million subscribers), followed by Hanaro Telecom with approximately 28.6% of the market and Thrunet with approximately 13.1%. of the market. In terms of technology, KT primarily uses Digital Subscriber Line (DSL). Hanaro uses a mix of cable and DSL. Thrunet service is mainly provided through cable modem.

At end of June 2011, subscribers of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service achieve 10.1 million or around 20 percent of South Korea&#x27;s population.

On February 27, 2024, Twitch has ended service in Korea due to the double charge of internet usage fee by the 3 Korean mobile service providers.

<text>Transportation in [[South Korea]] is provided by extensive networks of railways, highways, bus routes, ferry services and air routes that traverse the country. South Korea is the third country in the world to operate a maglev train, which is an automatically run people mover at Incheon International Airport.

==History==
Development of modern infrastructure began with the first Five-Year Development Plan (1962–66), which included the construction of 275 kilometers of railways and several small highway projects. Construction of the Gyeongbu Expressway, which connects the two major cities of Seoul and Busan, was completed on 7 July 1970.

In 1970, around half of the population of Seoul, one of South Korea&#x27;s most industrial cities, had moved to it only in the prior decade. With the rapid increase of people traveling across the country, a means of transporting large groups of people was needed. Public transportation, such as trams and railways, was installed for these people to move quickly. These people naturally settled in close proximity to jobs or near easy-to-move stations. The concentration of population in large cities continued and more transportation was needed to move these people.

The 1970s saw increased commitment to infrastructure investments. The third Five-Year Development Plan (1972–76) added the development of airports and seaports. The Subway system was built in Seoul, the highway network was expanded by 487 km and major port projects were started in Pohang, Ulsan, Masan, Incheon and Busan.

The development of industry and automobile technology in the 1960s led to a growing number of people having private cars, mainly in advanced countries such as Europe. The number of cars has more than doubled in Europe in a decade. People can go anywhere, anytime by car. Even now, the demand for cars continues to grow. Increased demand for cars has also helped ease the population&#x27;s downtown concentration. This is because you can buy a cheap house in a relatively remote area that was difficult to access by public transportation and travel by car. At first, residential areas were formed in the center of the city, and the size of the city grew as the concentric circle grew from the center. Of course, new roads had to be built and intersections, circular roads and highways had to be built to accommodate the growing number of cars. In other words, transportation systems such as private cars and road expansion have been developed to speed up travel time. The problem of environmental pollution is also a reason why public transportation has developed. The car&#x27;s fuel is consumed and pollutants such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and dust due to incomplete combustion are also released. By the 1990s, cars also emitted sulfur dioxide.

The railroad network experienced improvements in the 1980s with electrification and additional track projects. Operation speed was also increased on the main lines. Though the railroad was still more useful for transportation of freight, passenger traffic was also growing. There was 51,000 kilometers of roadways by 1988. Expressway network was expanded to connect more major cities and reached a combined length of 1,539 kilometers before the end of the decade.

==Rail==
The largest railway operator is Korail. Railway network is managed by Korea Rail Network Authority.

Korea Train Express began service in April 2004 as Korea&#x27;s first high-speed service. Intercity services are provided by ITX-Saemaeul and Mugunghwa-ho. ITX-Saemaeul generally stops less than Mugunghwa-ho. They stop in all stations and seat reservation is not available. On routes where KTX operates, air travel significantly declined with fewer passengers choosing to fly and airlines offering fewer flights.

Nuriro Train service runs between Seoul-Sinchang route and other lines. Nuriro Train serves commuters around Seoul Metropolitan Area, providing shorter travel time than Seoul Subway. The rapid trains have same cost and seat reservation as Mugunghwa-ho. Korail plans to expand the service area. (Stopped its service)

===Subways===

South Korea&#x27;s six largest cities — Seoul, Busan, Daegu, Gwangju, Daejeon and Incheon — all have subway systems.

Seoul&#x27;s subway system is the oldest system in the country, with the Seoul Station – Cheongnyangni section of Line 1 opening in 1974.

==Trams==
The first tram line in Seoul started operation between Seodaemun and Cheongnyangni in December 1898. The network was expanded to cover the whole downtown area (Jung-gu and Jongno-gu districts) as well as surrounding neighbourhoods, including Cheongnyangni in the east, Mapo-gu in the west, and Noryangjin across the Han River to the south.

The networks reached its peak in 1941, but was abandoned in favor of cars and the development of a subway system in 1968. Seoul Subway Line 1 and Line 2 follow the old streetcar routes along Jongno and Euljiro, respectively.

A new tram line is scheduled to open in Seoul in 2025, and openings are planned in Suwon and Seongnam in Gyeonggi-do, as well as in Busan and Daejeon.

==Buses==

===Regional services===

Virtually all towns in South Korea of all sizes are served by regional bus service. Regional routes are classified as &quot;gosok bus&quot; (고속버스, &quot;high speed&quot; express bus) or &quot;sioe bus&quot; (시외버스, &quot;suburban&quot; intercity bus) with gosok buses operating over the longer distances and making the fewest (if any) stops en route. Shioe buses typically operate over shorter distances, are somewhat slower, and make more stops. It is possible to reach another city by intercity buses. From Seoul, the place is Express Bus Terminal, the subway station is served by Seoul Subway Lines 3, 7 and 9.

===Local services===

Within cities and towns, two types of city bus operate in general: &quot;jwaseok&quot; (좌석, &quot;coach&quot;) and &quot;dosihyeong&quot; (도시형, &quot;city type&quot;) or &quot;ipseok&quot; (입석, &quot;standing&quot;). Both types of bus often serve the same routes, make the same (or fewer) stops and operate on similar frequencies, but jwaseok buses are more expensive and offer comfortable seating, while doshihyeong buses are cheaper and have fewer and less comfortable seats. Many small cities and towns do not have jwaseok buses and their buses are officially called &quot;nongeochon&quot; (농어촌, &quot;rural area&quot; bus). The local buses in Seoul and other cities are categorized by colours: the blue buses are trunk lines that cross the entire city, the green ones are circulator/short run lines that connect passengers with subway or railway stations, and the red buses are express lines go out of the city to nearby suburbs.

Some cities have their own bus classifying systems.

===Other services===
Incheon International Airport is served by an extensive network of high-speed buses from all parts of the country.

Beginning in the late 1990s, many department stores operated their own small networks of free buses for shoppers, but government regulation, confirmed by a court decision on June 28, 2001, have banned department stores from operating buses. However, most churches, daycare centres and private schools send buses around to pick up their congregants, patients or pupils.

=== Fares ===
Bus fares vary depending on the type of bus, the method of payment, and the age of the passenger. Passengers pay the right fare by placing their transportation card, which they can fill with money prior, on a card terminal. Among the various types (mainly classified according to distance traveled), there is a separate application for bus booking. The app has a simple payment function and passengers can quickly make a reservation, choosing a boarding date and seat. There are machines at bus stops that allow passengers to check their remaining balance on their transportation cards. In addition, the arrival time and remaining seats of the buses at the bus stop in question are displayed on the electronic display board. Passengers can determine the arrival time of a bus on various transportation applications.

=== Inclusion of Taxis ===
In South Korea, public transportation methods and facilities, like buses and railroad stations, receive financial support from the government. Not included in the list are taxis. Some South Koreans argue that taxi drivers should be included in public transportation even if they do not have regular connections due to the nature of taxis. On the other hand, other South Koreans disagree and express their opinions that what is considered the current means of public transportation should be maintained.

Some members of the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea proposed a bill to include taxis in the scope of public transportation in 2012, but bus drivers and operators decided to suspend the operation of buses in Korea in protest. In addition, the bill was opposed by the South Korean government. In April 2023, another bill has been put forward to include taxis in the group of public transportation methods.

=== Accommodations ===
Public transportation in South Korea lack accommodations for people with disabilities. For buses, there are low floor buses with low footrest heights and though they have increased in number compared to the past, they are still lacking. There are some areas where low-floor buses have difficulty running, making people who use them face difficulty when traveling to those areas. For subways, there are elevators and spaces for wheelchairs to help people with disabilities travel, however these places are often crowded and used by other passengers as well. Even for taxis (which are still being debated on being a part of public transportation), people with disabilities must reserve priorly to ride a taxi, and even then, usually have to wait a long time before it arrives. The lack of accommodations in the transportation system also has a social effect, as it has affected the number of people with disabilities who leave their homes to travel.

==Roads==

Highways in South Korea are classified as freeways (expressways/motorways), national roads and various classifications below the national level. Almost all freeways are toll highways and most of the expressways are built, maintained and operated by Korea Expressway Corporation (KEC).

The freeway network serves most parts of South Korea. Tolls are collected using an electronic toll collection system. KEC also operates service amenities (dining and service facilities) en route.

There are also several privately financed toll roads. Nonsan-Cheonan Expressway, Daegu-Busan Expressway, Incheon International Airport Expressway, Seoul-Chuncheon Expressway and parts of the Seoul Ring Expressway are wholly privately funded and operated BOT concessions. Donghae Expressway was built in cooperation between KEC and the National Pension Service.

Total length of the South Korean road network was 86,989 km in 1998. Of this, 1,996 km was expressways and 12,447 km national roads. By 2009, combined length of the expressways had reached approximately 3,000 km, it mostly equal to the whole area of South Korea

== Bicycle ==
In Korea, there is a record that Seo Jae-pil first introduced bicycles in 1895 after returning from the U.S. in the 1890s and toured the construction site of Independence Gate. At that time, it was called a wheelbarrow, but the government named it Bicycle in the 1903s.

When other public transportation is crowded, office workers often use bicycles as a faster transportation method when commuting. As the number of bicycle riders increased, almost every part of the country also built bike lanes. Bicycle-only roads are mainly accessible, and are designed to reduce the contact accidents between pedestrians and bicycles.

=== Social Benefits ===
There are many bicycle clubs in South Korea, as many people enjoy riding bicycles as a leisure activity. Many join bicycle clubs so they can build a bond between people and live a healthier life. However, there are growing calls for improvement as they are driving on motorways rather than bicycle lanes, and are feared to cause contact accidents between bicycles and cars.

==Waterways==
Virtually cut off from the Asian mainland, South Korea is a seafaring nation, with one of the world&#x27;s largest shipbuilding industries and an extensive system of ferry services. South Korea operates one of the largest merchant fleets serving China, Japan and the Middle East. Most fleet operators are large conglomerates, while most ferry operators are small, private operators.

There are 1,609 km of navigable waterways in South Korea, though use is restricted to small craft.

===Ferries===

The southern and westerns coasts of the country are dotted with small islands which are served by ferries. In addition, the larger offshore Jeju and Ulleung Islands are also served by ferry. Major centres for ferry service include Incheon, Mokpo, Pohang and Busan, as well as China and Japan.

===Ports and harbours===
The cities have major ports Jinhae, Incheon, Gunsan, Masan, Mokpo, Pohang, Busan ( Busan Port), Donghae, Ulsan, Yeosu, Jeju.

===Merchant Marine===
In 1999, there was a total of 461 merchant ships (1,000 GT or over) totalling 5,093,620 GT/. These are divisible by type as follows:
* bulk 98
* cargo 149
* chemical tanker 39
* combination bulk 4
* container 53
* liquefied gas 13
* multi-functional large load carrier 1
* passenger 3
* petroleum tanker 61
* refrigerated cargo 26
* roll-on/roll-off 4
* specialised tanker 4
* vehicle carrier 6

==Air travel==

Korean Air was founded by the government in 1962 to replace Korean National Airlines and has been privately owned since 1969. It was South Korea&#x27;s sole airline until 1988. In 2008, Korean Air served 2,164 million passengers, including 1,249 million international passengers.

A second carrier, Asiana Airlines, was established in 1988 and originally served Seoul, Jeju and Busan domestically and Bangkok, Singapore, Japan and Los Angeles internationally. By 2006, Asiana served 12 domestic cities, 66 cities in 20 foreign countries for commercial traffic and 24 cities in 17 countries for cargo traffic.

Combined, South Korean airlines currently serve 297 international routes. Smaller airliners, such as Air Busan, Jin Air, Eastar Jet and Jeju Air, provide domestic service and Japan/Southeast Asian route with lower fares.

South Korea contains the busiest passenger air corridor as measured by passengers per year. Over ten million people traveled between Seoul Gimpo Airport and Jeju in 2015 alone. As competition is fierce and prices affordable, the trend has been increasingly towards more air travel on this route. Similarly, air travel is also growing between Jeju and other mainland airports. There is discussion about a Jeju Undersea Tunnel which would make many of these domestic flights redundant.

Along other routes, air travel competes with the KTX high speed rail service and has declined in the 2000s and 2010s.

===Airports===

Construction of South Korea&#x27;s largest airport, Incheon International Airport, was completed in 2001, in time for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. By 2007, the airport was serving 30 million passengers a year. The airport has been selected as the &quot;Best Airport Worldwide&quot; for four consecutive years since 2005 by Airports Council International.

Seoul is also served by Gimpo International Airport (formerly Kimpo International Airport). International routes mainly serve Incheon, while domestic services mainly use Gimpo. Other major airports are in Busan and Jeju.

There are 103 airports in South Korea (1999 est.) and these may be classified as follows.

Airports with paved runways:
&quot;total:&quot;
67
&quot;over 3,047 m:&quot;
1
&quot;2,438 to 3,047 m:&quot;
18
&quot;1,524 to 2,437 m:&quot;
15
&quot;914 to 1,523 m:&quot;
13
&quot;under 914 m:&quot;

1
&quot;914 to 1,523 m:&quot;
3
&quot;under 914 m:&quot;
32 (1999 est.)

Heliports:
203 (1999 est.)

== Etiquette ==
In South Korean buses and subways, proper etiquette includes not talking or calling loudly as the systems are used by many other people, keeping the facilities clean, and avoiding the consumption of foods. For safety reasons, passengers board in order and get off in turn. In the subway, the proper system of passengers getting on and off is considered to be waiting for passengers to get off first and then getting on. Younger individuals are expected to give up their seat when the elderly and the weak board on the bus or subway as well.

== Pipelines ==
* South–North Pipeline Korea
* Trans Korea Pipeline
These pipelines are for petroleum products.
Additionally, there is a parallel petroleum, oils and lubricants (POL) pipeline being completed

<text>The Republic of Korea Armed Forces (), also known as the ROK Armed Forces, are the armed forces of South Korea. The ROK Armed Forces is one of the largest and most powerful standing armed forces in the world with a reported personnel strength of 3,600,000 in 2022 (500,000 active and 3,100,000 reserve).

The Republic of Korea Armed Forces traces its roots back to the establishment of the Korean Republic in 1919 wherein its armed wing was called the Korean Liberation Army and it conducted warfare against the Japanese occupation by conducting large-scale offensives, assassinations, bombings, sabotage, and search and rescue missions. Formally founded in 1948, following the establishment of the South Korean government after the liberation of Korea in 1945, South Korea&#x27;s military forces are responsible for maintaining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state and also engage in peacekeeping operations, humanitarian and disaster relief efforts worldwide.

==History==


The origin of the Republic of Korea Armed Forces can be traced back to the Korean Independence Army, which was established by the Provisional Government of Korea in exile in Chongking, Republic of China in 1940 during the Japanese rule of Korea. Many of its members became part of the South Korean armed forces later. In addition, some ethnic Korean Kuomintang and Manchukuo soldiers also contributed to the forces.

After Korea was liberated from the Empire of Japan on August 15, 1945, the Korean Constabulary () and the Korean Coast Guard (조선해안경비대, organized by Sohn Won-yil and others) were established through the United States Army Military Government in Korea. The Korean Constabulary and the Korean Coast Guard became the Republic of Korea Army and Republic of Korea Navy respectively, and formed the Republic of Korea Armed Forces after the South Korean government was established on August 15, 1948. The Republic of Korea Air Force was founded in October 1949.

The South Korean armed forces remained largely constabulary forces until the outbreak of the Korean War on June 25, 1950, requiring the United Nations to intervene with United States-led forces. The South Korean military rapidly developed during the Korean War, despite suffering enormous casualties. As the Soviets had armed North Korea, the U.S. armed and trained the South Korean military throughout the Korean War. After the Korean War, South Korea established a joint military partnership with the United States, termed the ROK-U.S. Alliance, as outlined by the Mutual Defense Treaty. During the Vietnam War, the ROK Army and ROK Marines were among those fighting alongside South Vietnam and the United States.

In the 1970s, through the Park Chung Hee Administration&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Yulgok&quot; Plan&quot; (), South Korea began to build up self-reliant, national defense capability. The name derived from a scholar and a advisor to the king during the Joseon Dynasty. He had called out for an army of 10,000 men to keep the nation safe from any attacks. During South Korea&#x27;s period of rapid growth in the 1980s, the military modernized, benefiting from several government-sponsored technology transfer projects and indigenous defense capability initiatives. In the 1990s, South Korean industries provided about 70 percent of the weapons, ammunition, communications and other types of equipment, vehicles, clothing, and other supplies needed by the military, and as of 2022, there are currently a total of 85 defense contractors in South Korea.

Today, the South Korean armed forces enjoy a good mix of avant-garde as well as older conventional weapons. Its capabilities include many sophisticated Western weapon systems, complemented by a growing and increasingly more advanced indigenous defense manufacturing sector. For example, by taking advantage of the strong local shipbuilding industry, the ROK Navy has embarked on a rigorous modernization plan with ambitions to become a blue-water navy in the 2020s.

==Future==
The ROK military forces are undergoing some preparation for assuming wartime operational control of the ROK&#x27;s defenses. Several cutting-edge military systems are currently being inducted.

Based on the Moon Jae-in Administration&#x27;s &#x27;Defense Reform 2.0&#x27; (국방개혁 2.0) and in line with the overall troop drawdown scheme, the number of generals and admirals will be reduced by 17 percent from the current 436 to 360 by 2022 to reduce the bloated top command apparatus. This means the removal of 66 general-level positions for the Army and five each for the Navy and Air Force. At the same time, the ROK Armed Forces will see a reduction in active duty personnel from 640,000 to 517,000, and the length of compulsory military service will also be reduced to 18 – 22 months by 2022.

&#x27;Defense Reform 2.0&#x27; is also intended to make the ROK military more independent to prepare for the ROK military retaining operational control authority in wartime (OPCON transfer), rather than American general taking command. Initial operational control capability was verified in 2019, with full operational capability planned for 2021, and full mission capability planned for 2022.

==Defense strategy==
The signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement in 1953 by the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (North Korea), ended the active hostilities of the Korean War. Since an official peace treaty has not been signed by North and South Korea, defensive actions needed to be implemented by the Republic of Korea Army in case of another North Korean attack.

During the Cold War era, a variety of anti-tank barricades were constructed over roads and railroad tracks leading in and out of Seoul, as well as within the Gyeonggi Province. The anti-tank barricades or &quot;rock drops&quot; are made up of giant concrete blocks mounted on thin walls, made to look like fake bridges and overpasses, that lead to nowhere but house hundreds of tons of rubble. 
These structures are rigged with explosives and are designed to be blown up by the South Korean Army which would drop the rubble blocking roads and railways. Along with the anti-tank barricades, the South Korean Army placed barbed-wire fences along the Han River and hundreds of 3-foot tall concrete pillars arranged in rows, known as &quot;dragon teeth&quot;, across open fields. During the 1970s and 1980s when most of these structures were built, the goal was to slow down enemy tanks, troops, and other vehicles and to buy time for South Korean civilians to flee from the invading North Korean forces, as well as to allow for the Republic of Korea and the United States Army to employ troops to defensive positions. 
The South Korean Ministry of National Defense claims that the anti-tank barricades are inspected regularly for safety concerns, but the barricades show cracks and signs of erosion.

Local governments and civilians are now demanding that the anti-tank barricades be removed as they pose a great safety risk, obstruct new development, and many people believe have outlived their purpose. There are about 250,000 vehicles a day that pass by the barricades and their vibrations contribute to weakening the structures. Despite safety concerns, tearing down barricades is a complicated matter.

Since North Korea lost security and economic support from Russia in 1990 and China in 1992, a full-ground force assault on South Korea is unlikely according to military analysts. North Korea has changed its military tactics and now focuses on long-range and covert strikes. Through long-range artillery barrages, missile strikes, or chemical weapons that are used to deliberately attack non-American targets and short of all-out war, the North could seek to hold Seoul hostage with the hope of renegotiating a new status quo. Special warfare units are expected to use wartime tunnels or various infiltration means such as submarines, air-cushion vehicles (ACVs), AN-2 aircraft, and helicopters to infiltrate the forward and rear areas and conduct hybrid operations in the form of striking major units and facilities, assassinating key figures, and disturbing the rear area.
The Defense Reform Base Plan was originally presented by President Roh Moo-hyun in December 2006, but after years of evolution, and political and military pushback the reform was launched by President Moon Jae-in&#x27;s administration. The ROK Armed Forces will firmly implement Defense Reform 2.0 to proactively respond to changes in the security environment and omnidirectional security threats, as well as support peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula based on strength. To this end, the ROK Armed Forces will work toward &quot;steadfast national defense.

On 27 December 2022 North Korea sent five drones over the border, one reaching Seoul. All five returned to the North, despite a five hour chase involving fighter jets and attack helicopters, with some 100 rounds being fired. A KAI KT-1 Woongbi crashed although both crew survived. The Joint Chiefs of Staff released a statement in which it acknowledges it can stop attack drones. However, its ability to stop smaller spy drones is &quot;limited&quot;. A senior official, Kang Shin-chul, said: &quot;Our military&#x27;s lack of preparedness has caused a lot of concern to the people…actively employ detection devices to spot the enemy&#x27;s drone from an early stage and aggressively deploy strike assets&quot;. The South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has indicated that South Korea will invest in stealthy drones that could penetrate North Korea with the creation of a new military unit.

The South Korean Defence Ministry announced a new series of anti-drone measures, spending some 560 billion won over the next five years. The money will go towards four new initiatives. One is an airborne laser that will be used to destroy larger drones whilst a jammer would be used on smaller drones. A new counter drone unit, made up of two squadrons, would also be created. The laser is already in the test process and is expected to become operational in 2027. The jamming system has been described as &quot;soft kill&quot;. Further work will be done on stealth jets and anti-rocket artillery systems. The total amount of the spending over the next five years is 331.4 trillion. The previous Defence budget for the last financial year was just 54.6 trillion won as a comparison.

== Command structure ==
Command over the ROK Armed Forces is established in the Constitution. The President is the Commander-in-Chief Forces &quot;ex officio&quot;. The military authority runs from the President to the Minister of National Defense, who is often to be (but not legally bound to be) a retired four-star general. The President and Minister of National Defense are in charge of the entire military establishment, maintaining civilian control of the military. The Minister of National Defense, by order of the President, takes charge of military affairs, and supervises the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the chief of staff of each service of the Armed Forces.

To coordinate military strategy with political affairs, the President has a National Security Council headed by the National Security Advisor.

=== Joint Chiefs of Staff ===
The Joint Chiefs of Staff consists of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the military service chiefs from the Army, Navy, and Air Force. Unlike the U.S. counterpart, operational command of combat units falls within the purview of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who reports to the Minister of National Defense.

The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a four-star general or admiral, is the senior officer of the Armed Forces. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff assists the Minister of National Defense with regard to operational command authority, and supervises the combat units of each service of the Armed Forces, by order of the Minister of National Defense. The chain of operational control runs straight from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the commandants of the Army, Navy, and Air Force operational commands. The respective chiefs of staff of each service branch (Army, Navy, and Air Force) has administrative control over his or her own service.

==Service branches==
The ROK Armed Forces consists of the ROK Army, ROK Navy, and ROK Air Force. The ROK Marine Corps functions as a branch of the Navy. The ROK Reserve Forces is a reserve component.

===ROK Army===

The ROK Army (ROKA) is by far the largest of the military branches, with about 420,000 personnel as of 2020. This comes as a response to both the mountainous terrain native to the Korean Peninsula (70% mountainous) as well as the heavy North Korean presence, with its 1-million-strong army, two-thirds of which is permanently garrisoned in the frontline near the DMZ. The current administration has initiated a program of self-defense, whereby South Korea would be able to fully counter the North Korean threat with purely domestic means by about 2030.

The ROK Army was formerly organized into three armies: the First Army (FROKA), Third Army (TROKA) and Second Operational Command each with its own headquarters, corps (not Second Operational Command), and divisions. The Third Army was responsible for the defense of the capital as well as the western section of the DMZ. The First Army was responsible for the defense of the eastern section of the DMZ whereas the Second Operational Command formed the rearguard.

Under a restructuring plan aimed at reducing redundancy, the First and Third Armies will be incorporated into the newly formed First Operations Command, whereas the Second ROK Army has been converted into the Second Operational Command. The army consists of the Army Headquarters, the Aviation Command, and the Special Warfare Command, with 9 corps, 36 divisions, some 464,000 troops and estimated as many as 5,850 tanks and armored vehicles, 11,337 artillery systems, 7,032 missile defense systems and 13,000 infantry support systems.

The army will take the brunt of the personnel reduction part of the Defense Reform 307. Associated with this personnel reduction would be a significant reduction in the ROK Army force structure, in particular decreasing the current force of 47 divisions (active duty and reserve) down to a force of about 28 divisions.

===ROK Navy===


The ROK Navy (ROKN) is responsible for naval and amphibious operations. The ROK Navy has about 70,000 regular personnel including 29,000 Republic of Korea Marines. There are about 150 commissioned ships with the ROK Navy (a total displacement of about 215,000 tonnes). The naval aviation force consists of about 70 fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft.

The Republic of Korea Navy includes the Republic of Korea Navy Headquarters, Republic of Korea Fleet, and Republic of Korea Marine Corps. The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) is the highest-ranking officer of the ROK Navy, and oversees the administration of organizing, recruiting, training, equipping, supplying, and mobilizing the ROK Navy. The Republic of Korea Fleet is the highest operational command of the ROK Navy.

Since the 1990s, the ROK Navy has been trying to build an ocean-going fleet to protect the sea lines of communication. During Admiral An Pyong-tae&#x27;s tenure as CNO, President Kim Young-sam supported the Navy by approving a long-term shipbuilding plan for the ocean-going navy. In the first decade of the 21st century, the ROK Navy launched the lead ships of larger and better equipped warships with local shipbuilders: In 2002, ROKS &quot;Chungmugong Yi Sunshin&quot; (DDH 975), a 4,500-ton destroyer, was launched; in 2005, the 14,000-ton amphibious warfare ship, ROKS &quot;Dokdo&quot; (LPH 6111) was launched; in 2006, the ROK Navy launched ROKS &quot;Sohn Wonyil&quot; (SS 072), an 1,800-ton Type 214 submarine with Air-Independent propulsion (AIP) system. In 2007, the ROK Navy launched the lead ship (DDG 991) of &quot;Sejong the Great-&quot;class destroyers with the Aegis Combat System.

The ROK Navy completed a new naval base called Jeju Civilian-Military Complex Port in 2016 on the southern coast of Jeju Island to protect the sea lines of communication. In order to support ocean-going operations, the ROK Navy commissioned the 10,000-ton logistics support ship, ROKS &quot;Soyang&quot; (AOE 51), and launched the first locally designed 3,000-ton submarine, &quot;Dosan Ahn Changho&quot; (SS 083) in 2018. The ROK Navy continues to upgrade ongoing shipbuilding programs such as the Korean Submarine (KSS), Korean Destroyer Experimental (KDX), Frigate Experimental (FFX), and Landing Transport Experimental (LPX).

The ROK Navy aims to become a blue-water navy in the 2020s.

====ROK Marine Corps====

The ROK Marine Corps (ROKMC) is a branch of the Republic of Korea Navy responsible for amphibious operations, and also functions as a rapid reaction force and a strategic reserve. The ROK Marine Corps, with 29,000 personnel, is organized into two divisions and two brigades. The ROK Marine Corps has about 300 tracked vehicles including assault amphibious vehicles, main battle tanks, and self-propelled artillery.

The Commandant of the Republic of Korea Marine Corps is a three-star general. Following the bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island in 2010 and the subsequent establishment of the Northwest Islands Defense Command (NWIDC), the Commandant of the ROKMC has been dual-hatted as the Commander NWIDC.

===ROK Air Force===

The ROK Air Force (ROKAF) maintains a modern air and space force in order to defend itself from various modes of threats, including the North Korean Army. The ROK Air Force fields some 450 combat aircraft of American design. In contrast, the North Korean Army has roughly 650 combat aircraft, but mostly obsolete types of Soviet and Chinese origin.

Korea began a program for the development of indigenous jet trainers beginning in 1997. This project eventually culminated in the KAI T-50, dubbed the &quot;Golden Eagle&quot; which is used as a trainer for jet pilots, now being exported to Indonesia. A multirole all-weather version of the T-50 is the modified FA-50, which can be externally fitted with Rafael&#x27;s Sky Shield or LIG Nex1&#x27;s ALQ-200K ECM pods, Sniper or LITENING targeting pods, and Condor 2 reconnaissance pods to further improve the fighter&#x27;s electronic warfare, reconnaissance, and targeting capabilities. Other improved weapon systems over FA-50 include SPICE multifunctional guidance kits, Textron CBU-97/105 Sensor Fuzed Weapon with WCMD tail kits, JDAM, and JDAM-ER for more comprehensive air-to-ground operations, and AIM-120 missiles for BVR air-to-air operations. FA-50 has provisions for, but does not yet integrate, Python and Derby missiles, also produced by Rafael, and other anti-ship missiles, stand-off weapons, and sensors to be domestically developed by Korea.

The Republic of Korea Air Force also expressed interests in acquiring the RQ-4 Global Hawk and Joint Direct Attack Munition kits to further improve their intelligence and offensive capabilities.

The replacement programs for the F-4D/E and F-5A/B/E/F are the KTX-2 and F-X, respectively. The latter has been fulfilled by the Boeing F-15K.

The South Korean government also announced its plan to develop domestic helicopter manufacturing to replace the aging UH-1 helicopters, many of which had seen service during the Vietnam War. The program originally included plans to develop both a civilian and a military helicopter. This was later revised and gave priority to the utility helicopter program. Based on the success and experience of the civilian KMH (Korean Multi-purpose Helicopter), an attack helicopter with a shared configuration is planned to be developed.

==Personnel==
Conscription in South Korea requires male citizens between the age of 18 and 28 to perform compulsory military service. Women are not required to perform military service, but they may volunteer as officers, warrant officers, or non-commissioned officers.

The length of compulsory military service varies based on service branches: Active duty enlisted personnel serve 18 months in the Army or Marine Corps, 20 months in the Navy, and 21 months in the Air Force (the length of military service will be reduced to 18 – 22 months by 2022.). Commissioned officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers are volunteer-based, and serve longer terms than those of enlisted personnel, or as career. Non-active duty personnel such as social work personnel serve for various lengths. After conscripts finish their military service, they are automatically placed on the reserve roster.

===Ranks===
In the South Korean armed forces, ranks fall into one of four categories: commissioned officer, warrant officer, non-commissioned officer, and junior enlisted (&quot;&quot;Byeong&quot;), in decreasing order of authority. Commissioned officer ranks are subdivided into &quot;Jangseong&quot;-level (general) officers, &quot;Yeonggwan&quot;-level (field-grade) officers, and &quot;Wigwan&quot;&quot;-level (company-grade) officers. All three branches of the South Korean Armed Forces share the same rank insignia and titles in Korean (The English titles are given as comparative examples with the US Army ranks.).

ROK Navy commissioned officer ranks have two distinct sets of rank insignia: On dress uniform, a series of stripes similar to Commonwealth naval ranks are worn; on service uniforms, working uniforms, and special uniform situations (combat utilities and flight suits), the rank insignia are the same as the equivalent rank in the Army or the Air Force.

====Commissioned officer ranks====
====Warrant officer ranks====
====Other ranks====
==Budget==
South Korea has one of the highest defense budgets in the world, ranking 9th globally in 2021, with a budget of nearly $46.7 billion U.S. dollars, and the defense budget trends from 1975 to 2023 based on South Korea&#x27;s 2015 GDP announced by the Ministry of National Defense are as follows, and the actual annual military expenditure may be higher because the amount of the executive budget does not include the supplementary budget.

==Overseas deployments==
As part of its mission, the ROK Armed Forces have engaged in peacekeeping operations, humanitarian, and disaster-relief efforts worldwide. In 2008, officers and soldiers of Unit Dongmyeong, stationed in Lebanon with the UNIFIL, received honorary medals from the United Nations.

==Asia==
=== China (PRC) ===
Active South Korean-Chinese people-to-people contacts have been encouraged. Academics, journalists and particularly families divided between South Korea and the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) were able to exchange visits freely in the late 1980s. Nearly 2 million ethnic Koreans, especially in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province of Northeast China, have interacted with South Koreans.

Trade between the two countries continued to increase nonetheless, Furthermore, China has attempted to mediate between North Korea and the United States, and between North Korea and Japan. China also initiated and promoted tripartite talks between North Korea, South Korea and the U.S.

South Korea had long been an ally of Taiwan. Diplomatic ties between Seoul and Taipei were nevertheless severed in 1992. Formal diplomatic relations were established between Seoul and Beijing on August 24, 1992.

In 2004 the PRC government began the Northeast Project, sparking a massive uproar in South Korea when the project was widely publicized.

After the KORUS FTA (United States-South Korea Free Trade Agreement) was finalized on June 30, 2007, the Chinese government has immediately begun seeking an FTA agreement with South Korea. The FTA between South Korea and China are under discussion. South Korea has been running a trade surplus with China which hit a record US$32.5 billion in 2009.

=== Taiwan (ROC) ===

On 23 August 1992, the government of the Republic of China (by then only in control of the island of Taiwan and a few outlying areas) severed diplomatic relations with South Korea in advance of its announcement of formal recognition of the People&#x27;s Republic of China based in Beijing. The Yonhap News said in 2002 that since then relations between the two governments have been &quot;in a rut&quot;.

=== Japan ===
 

The relation between South Korea and Japan has both political conflicts and economic intimacies. Examples of conflicts include the East sea naming dispute, visits by successive Japanese Prime Ministers to the Yasukuni Shrine and the disputed ownership of Dokdo of the island Korea.

On January 18, 1952, The first president of South Korea Syngman Rhee declared that the vicinity of Dokdo was a territory of South Korea (Syngman Rhee line). Subsequently, some 3,000 Japanese fishermen who conducted fishery operations in this vicinity were captured. This incident, called the Dai Ichi Daihoumaru Ship case strained relations between South Korea and Japan.

June 22, 1965, The president in South Korea Park Chung Hee concluded the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and South Korea As a result, Japan considered South Korea to be the legitimate successor of its rule over the Korean Peninsula.

South Korea&#x27;s trade with Japan was US$892.1 million in 2008, with a surplus of nearly US$327.1 million on the Japanese side. Japanese and South Koreans firms often had interdependent relations, which gave Japan advantages in South Korea&#x27;s growing market.

In 1996 FIFA announced that the South Korea-Japan would jointly host the 2002 FIFA World Cup. The next few years would see leaders of both countries meet to warm relations in preparations for the games. The year 2005 was designated as the &quot;Japan-South Korea Friendship Year&quot;. However, the Liancourt Rocks controversy erupted again when Japan&#x27;s Shimane Prefecture declared &quot;Takeshima Day&quot;, inciting mass demonstrations in South Korea.

Japan calls South Korea a partner in its diplomatic charter, and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol also said, &quot;Korea and Japan are now partners who share universal values and pursue common interests.&quot;

===Mongolia===
 
Both countries established diplomatic relations on March 26, 1990. South Korea has an embassy in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Mongolia has an embassy in Seoul.

===Philippines===
Since the establishment of diplomatic ties on 3 March 1949, the relationship between the Philippines and South Korea has flourished. The Philippines was one of the first countries that extended diplomatic recognition to South Korea. This was cemented with the Philippine government&#x27;s deployment of the Philippine Expeditionary Force to Korea (PEFTOK) to help South Korea against the invasion of the communist North during the Korean War in the 1950s. After the war, the Philippines provided development assistance to South Korea and helped the country rebuild itself.

Since then, the Philippines&#x27;s relations with South Korea have evolved with South Korea becoming one of the Philippines&#x27;s most important bilateral partners aside from the United States, China and Japan. The Philippines&#x27;s government seeks to cultivate strategic ties with South Korea given its increasing presence in the country. In the coming years, the Philippines anticipates to benefit from exploring unprecedented opportunities from South Korea that shall contribute significantly to the country&#x27;s trade and economy, defense and security, and society and culture.

=== Vietnam ===

The relationship between these two Sinosphere countries is usually described as &quot;from enemies to friends&quot;. Despite the two states&#x27; hostile positions in the Vietnam War and South Korean war crimes and atrocities in the Vietnam War, which still causes lingering controversies between the two states, both countries have still become each other&#x27;s most important trade partner throughout their relationship. South Korea is the third biggest trade partner of Vietnam while also being the second-biggest ODA provider and the biggest foreign direct investor to Vietnam; meanwhile, Vietnam is the third-biggest trade partner of South Korea and it is also hosting many important factories and facilities of South Korea&#x27;s biggest conglomerate such as Samsung and LG.

In December 2022, the two nations have elevated their ties to &quot;comprehensive strategic partnership&quot; – technically the highest level of bilateral relationship that is designated by the Vietnamese side. Both countries have aimed to raise their two-way trade to 100 billion U.S. dollars in 2023 and expected to reach 150 billion by the end of this decade. Besides major economic ties and cooperations, South Korea and Vietnam also plan to further cooperate in politics, cultural exchange, resources exploitation, national security as well as in the defense sectors. Both countries share core benefits, concerns, and support to each other in issues related to the security of the region, noticeably Vietnamese support towards South Korea&#x27;s effort in denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula (mentioning North Korea) and South Korea&#x27;s support on Vietnam&#x27;s attitude towards the stability and freedom of navigation of the South China Sea. Vietnam is also an important partner of South Korea to exercise its Indo-Pacific strategy and the insight to strengthen South Korea&#x27;s relationship with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. It is said that Vietnam can be a &quot;bridge&quot; or &quot;ambassador&quot; representing South Korea&#x27;s influence to the Southeast Asia region.

In the state visit of the President of Vietnam to South Korea in December 2022, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has honored Vietnamese President Nguyễn Xuân Phúc as &quot;my very first national guest&quot; (referring the fact that his Vietnamese counterpart was the first head of state to visit South Korea during his terms), and also saying that the people of Vietnam and South Korea are &quot;close brothers&quot;.

=== North Korea ===

Inter-Korean relations may be divided into five periods. The first stage was between 1972 and 1973; the second stage was Pyongyang North Korea&#x27;s delivery of relief goods to South Korea after a typhoon caused devastating floods in 1984 and the third stage was the exchange of home visits and performing artists in 1985. The fourth stage, activated by Nordpolitik under Roh, was represented by expanding public and private contacts between the two Koreas. The fifth stage was improved following the 1997 election of Kim Dae-jung. His &quot;Sunshine Policy&quot; of engagement with North Korea set the stage for the historic June 2000 Inter-Korean summit.

The possibility of Korean reunification has remained a prominent topic. However, no peace treaty has yet been signed with the North. In June 2000, a historic first North Korea-South Korea summit took place, part of the South Korea&#x27;s continuing Sunshine Policy of engagement. Since then, regular contacts have led to a cautious thaw. President Kim was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2000 for the policy.

With that policy, continued by the following administration of president Roh Moo-hyun, economic ties between the two countries have increased, humanitarian aid has been sent to North Korea and some divided families have been briefly reunited. Military ties remain fraught with tension, however, and in 2002 a brief naval skirmish left four South Korean sailors dead, leaving the future of the Sunshine policy uncertain. The North Korea cut off talks but the South remained committed to the policy of reconciliation and relations began to thaw again. The resurgence of the nuclear issue two years later would again cast relations in doubt, but South Korea has sought to play the role of intermediary rather than antagonist, and economic ties at the time seemed to be growing again.

Despite the Sunshine Policy and efforts at reconciliation, the progress was complicated by North Korean missile tests in 1993, 1998, 2006 and 2009. , relationships between North Korea and South Korea were very tense; North Korea had been reported to have deployed missiles, Ended its former agreements with South Korea and threatened South Korea and the United States not to interfere with a satellite launch it had planned.
As of 2009 North Korea and South Korea are still opposed and share a heavily fortified border.

On May 27, 2009, North Korea media declared that the armistice is no longer valid due to the South Korean government&#x27;s pledge to &quot;definitely join&quot; the Proliferation Security Initiative. To further complicate and intensify strains between the two nations, the sinking of the South Korean warship &quot;Cheonan&quot; in March 2010, killing 46 seamen, is as of May 20, 2010 claimed by a team of researchers around the world to have been caused by a North Korean torpedo, which the North denies. South Korea agreed with the findings from the research group and president Lee Myung-bak declared in May 2010 that Seoul would cut all trade with North Korea as part of measures primarily aimed at striking back at North Korea diplomatically and financially. As a result of this, North Korea severed all ties and completely abrogated the previous pact of non aggression.

In November 2010, the Unification Ministry officially declared the Sunshine Policy a failure, thus bringing the policy to an end. On November 23, 2010, North Korean artillery shelled Yeonpyeong with dozens of rounds at Yeonpyeong-ri and the surrounding area.
According to a 2013 BBC World Service Poll, 3% of South Koreans view North Korea&#x27;s influence positively, with 91% expressing a negative view. A 2015 government-sponsored poll revealed that 41% of South Koreans consider North Korea to be an enemy, with negative views being more prevalent among younger respondents. Still, in a 2017 poll, 58% of South Koreans said they don&#x27;t expect another war to break out with North Korea.

==Europe==
===Russia===


In the 1980s South Korean president Roh Tae Woo&#x27;s Nordpolitik and Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s &quot;New Thinking&quot; were both attempts to reverse their nations&#x27; recent histories. Gorbachev had signaled Soviet interest in improving relations with all countries in the Asia-Pacific region including South Korea as explained in his July 1986 Vladivostok and August 1988 Krasnoyarsk speeches.

In initiating Nordpolitik Roh&#x27;s confidential foreign policy adviser was rumored to have visited Moscow Russia to consult with Soviet policymakers. Kim Young Sam visited Moscow, Russian Federation from June 2 to June 10, 1989, as the Kremlin announced that it would allow some 300,000 Soviet-South Koreans who had been on the Soviet island of Sakhalin since the end of World War II to return permanently to South Korea. Moscow even arranged Kim&#x27;s meeting with the North Korean ambassador to the Soviet Union In June 1990, Roh held his first summit with president Gorbachev in San Francisco, United States.

South Korea and the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations on September 30, 1990. These relations continued by the Russian Federation on December 27, 1991. Russian president Vladimir Putin visited Seoul in February 2001 while South Korean president Roh Moo-hyun visited Moscow, Russia in September 2004.

Russian Federal Space Agency and the Korean Astronaut Program cooperated together to send South Korea&#x27;s first astronaut into space. Yi So-Yeon became the first South Korean national as well as the third woman to be the first national in space on 8 April 2008 when Soyuz TMA-12 departed from Baikonur Cosmodrome.

Since the 1990s there has been greater trade and cooperation between the Russian Federation and South Korea. The total trade volume between South Korea and Russia in 2003 was 4.2 billion U.S. dollars.

=== European Union ===

The European Union (EU) and South Korea are important trading partners, having negotiated a free trade agreement for many years since South Korea was designated as a priority FTA partner in 2006. The free trade agreement has been approved in September 2010, following Italy&#x27;s conditional withdrawal of its veto of the free trade agreement. The compromise made by Italy was that free trade agreement would take provisional effect on July 1, 2011. South Korea is the EU&#x27;s eighth largest trade partner and the EU has become South Korea&#x27;s second largest export destination. EU trade with South Korea exceeded €65 billion in 2008 and has enjoyed an annual average growth rate of 7.5% between 2004 and 2008.

The EU has been the single largest foreign investor in South Korea since 1962 and accounted for almost 45% of all FDI inflows into South Korea in 2006. Nevertheless, EU companies have significant problems accessing and operating in South Korea market due to stringent standards and testing requirements for products and services often creating barriers to trade. Both in its regular bilateral contacts with South Korea and through its FTA with South Korea, the EU is seeking to improve this situation.

==Americas==
=== United States ===


The United States engaged in the decolonization of Korea (mainly in the South, with the Soviet Union engaged in North Korea) from Japan after World War II. After three years of military administration by the United States, the South Korean government was established. Upon the onset of the Korean War, U.S. forces were sent to defend South Korea against invasion by North Korea and later China. Following the Armistice, South Korea and the U.S. agreed to a &quot;Mutual Defense Treaty&quot;, under which an attack on either party in the Pacific area would summon a response from both.

In 1968, South Korea obliged the mutual defense treaty, by sending a large combat troop contingent to support the United States in the Vietnam War. The U.S. Eighth Army, Seventh Air Force, and U.S. Naval Forces Korea are stationed in South Korea. The two nations have strong economic, diplomatic, and military ties, although they have at times disagreed with regard to policies towards North Korea, and with regard to some of South Korea&#x27;s industrial activities that involve usage of rocket or nuclear technology. There had also been strong anti-American sentiment during certain periods, which has largely moderated in the modern day.

Since the late 1980s, the country has instead sought to establish an American partnership, which has made the Seoul–Washington relationship subject to severe strains. Trade had become a serious source of friction between the two countries. In 1989, the United States was South Korea&#x27;s largest and most important trading partner and South Korea was the seventh-largest market for United States goods and the second largest market for its agricultural products.

From Roh Tae-woo&#x27;s administration to Roh Moo Hyun&#x27;s administration, South Korea sought to establish a U.S. partnership, which has made the Seoul–Washington relationship subject to some strains. In 2007, a free trade agreement known as the Republic of Korea-United States Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) was reportedly signed between South Korea and the United States, but its formal implementation has been repeatedly delayed, pending further approval by the legislative bodies of the two countries.

The relations between the United States and South Korea have greatly strengthened under the Lee Myung-bak administration. At the 2009 G-20 London summit, U.S. President Barack Obama called South Korea &quot;one of America&#x27;s closest allies and greatest friends.&quot;
However, some anti-American sentiment in South Korea still exists; the United States&#x27; alleged role in the May 1980 Gwangju uprising was a pressing South Korean political issue of the 1980s. Even after a decade, some Gwangju citizens and other South Koreans still blamed the United States for its perceived involvement in the bloody uprising. In 2008, the protests against U.S. beef was a center of a major controversy that year.

In a June 2010 open letter from President of South Korea Lee Myung-bak published in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, he expressed gratitude for the 37,000 Americans who were killed in the Korean War defending South Korea, saying that they fought for the freedom of South Koreans they did not even know. He stated that thanks to their sacrifices, the peace and democracy of the South Korean state was protected.

The U.S. states that &quot;The Alliance is adapting to changes in the 21st Century security environment. We will maintain a robust defense posture, backed by allied capabilities which support both nations&#x27; security interests We will continue to deepen our strong bilateral economic, trade and investment relations In the Asia-Pacific region we will work jointly with regional institutions and partners to foster prosperity, keep the peace, and improve the daily lives of the people of the region The United States and South Korea will work to achieve our common Alliance goals through strategic cooperation at every level.&quot;

On 9 October 2024, South Korean Defence Minister Kim Yong-hyun emphasized the need for stronger joint military drills with the U.S. to counter North Korean threats and address concerns about growing North Korea-Russia military ties.

<text>The largest cities of South Korea have an autonomous status equivalent to that of provinces. Seoul, the largest city and capital, is classified as a &quot;teukbyeolsi&quot; (Special City), while the next six-largest cities are classified as &quot;gwangyeoksi&quot; (Metropolitan Cities). Smaller cities are classified as &quot;si&quot; (&quot;cities&quot;) and are under provincial jurisdiction, at the same level as counties.

== City status==
Article 10 of the Local Autonomy Act defines the standards under which a populated area may become a city: an area which is predominantly urbanised and has a population of at least 50,000; a which has an urbanised area with a population of at least 50,000; or a which has a total population of at least 150,000 and multiple urbanised areas each with a population of at least 20,000. 

Under Article 3 of the Local Autonomy Act, a city with a population of less than 500,000 may create administrative subdivisions in the form of in its urbanised area and or in its rural area, while a city with a population of more than 500,000 may create administrative subdivisions in the form of non-autonomous .

== Classifications for large municipal cities ==
The national government can designate cities of at least 500,000 inhabitants as special status cities. This status expands the scope of administrative authority delegated from the provincial government to the city government.

A big city is a city (other than a special city or a metropolitan city) that has a population greater than 500,000, and has been designated by an order of the national government under Article 198 of the Local Autonomy Act. Big municipal cities are given the power to subdivide themselves into non-autonomous districts (). 

Due its legal status as an administrative city, Jeju City cannot be designated as a &quot;big city&quot; under the Local Autonomy Law, despite having an estimated population exceeding 500,000 as of 2022. The designation of &quot;administrative city&quot; was created by the law which granted special self-governing status to Jeju Province; that law specifically states that the Local Autonomy Act would not apply to administrative cities. As such, Jeju City does not enjoy special autonomy and only has the same legal powers as the much smaller Seogwipo. The administrative authority of Jeju City is trying to expand the scope of administrative authority delegated from the provincial government to the city government.

===Special-status city===

A special-status city is a subclass of big municipal city that has a population greater than 1,500,000.

<text>Jesse Bonds Weaver Jr. (born June 22, 1962), better known by the stage name Schoolly D, is an American rapper from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

== Biography ==
Schoolly D was born Jesse Bonds Weaver Jr. in West Philadelphia and raised in Philadelphia as well as Georgia.

In the mid-1980s, Schoolly D teamed up with DJ Code Money with lyrics reflecting urban realism, violence, and sexual bravado. He was interviewed in the 1986 documentary &quot;Big Fun in the Big Town&quot;. He later embraced an Afrocentric style, bringing Afrocentric culture to hip hop along with KRS-One.

Schoolly D contributed songs and music to many Abel Ferrara films, including &quot;P.S.K.&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night&quot; (from &quot;Saturday Night! – The Album&quot;) as well as &quot;King of New York&quot; to Ferrara&#x27;s film of the same name and the title track from &quot;Am I Black Enough For You?&quot; that was played during the climactic shoot-out in that film, the title track from &quot;How a Black Man Feels&quot;, and &quot;Signifying Rapper&quot; (from &quot;Smoke Some Kill&quot;), which was used in Ferrara&#x27;s film &quot;Bad Lieutenant&quot;. Because Led Zeppelin successfully sued due to an uncleared interpolation of their song &quot;Kashmir&quot; in &quot;Signifying Rapper&quot;, the song was omitted from the soundtrack of the film and from subsequent releases of the film.

Composer Joe Delia tapped Schoolly to co-write and record &quot;The Player&quot; for Ferrara&#x27;s film &quot;The Blackout&quot;, which Delia scored. Schoolly also wrote the score to Ferrara&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;R Xmas&quot;. In 2006, Schoolly D co-wrote the indie film soundtrack of the historical science fiction thriller &quot;Order of the Quest&quot; with Chuck Treece. The project series is produced by Benjamin Barnett, and Jay D Clark of Media Bureau. His last album, &quot;Funk &#x27;N Pussy&quot;, on Jeff &quot;Met&quot; Thies&#x27; Chord Recordings features guest appearances by Public Enemy&#x27;s Chuck D, Chuck Chillout, Lady B and a drum and bass remix of the classic Schoolly D track &quot;Mr. Big Dick&quot; (remixed by UK trip hop crew The Sneaker Pimps).

Schoolly also performed the music and occasional narration for the cult animated series &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; on the Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim programming block. He was a guest on a first-season episode of &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. He also created the song &quot;Sharkian Nights&quot; for the Adult Swim series &quot;12 oz. Mouse&quot;. The character Jesse B. Weaver from &quot;The Rudy and Gogo World Famous Cartoon Show&quot; was also named after him.

In November 2006 Schoolly D and Cartoon Network were sued over the &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; theme music. A drummer by the name of Terence Yerves claimed he had also written the theme music alongside Schoolly D in 1999 while working at the Meat Locker Studio. Yerves was aware the song would be used for a television series but did not approve of it being used for &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot;, however, did not file the copyright to the Library of Congress until May 2006, after the series&#x27; fourth season had already started airing. In the lawsuit Yerves demanded he receive $150,000 for every time the series was aired after the lawsuit was filed, he also demanded that all existing copies of the series&#x27; DVDs be impounded and for &quot;Aqua Teen Hunger Force&quot; to cease broadcast.

On December 30, 2022 he released his newest album, &quot;Cause Schoolly D Is Crazy&quot;.

<doc id="27032" wikidata="Q106631" url="?curid=27032" title="Rock paper scissors">
<text>Rock paper scissors (also known by several other names and word orders, see § Names) is an intransitive hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are &quot;rock&quot; (a closed fist), &quot;paper&quot; (a flat hand), and &quot;scissors&quot; (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). The earliest form of &quot;rock paper scissors&quot;-style game originated in China and was subsequently imported into Japan, where it reached its modern standardized form, before being spread throughout the world in the early 20th century.

A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has three possible outcomes: a draw, a win, or a loss. A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who chooses scissors (&quot;rock crushes scissors&quot; or &quot;breaks scissors&quot; or sometimes &quot;blunts scissors&quot;), but will lose to one who has played paper (&quot;paper covers rock&quot;); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors (&quot;scissors cuts paper&quot;). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied, but is usually replayed until there is a winner.

Rock paper scissors is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to coin flipping, drawing straws, or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision. Unlike truly random selection methods, however, rock paper scissors can be played with some degree of skill by recognizing and exploiting non-random behavior in opponents.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;rock paper scissors&quot; is simply a translation of the Japanese words for the three gestures involved in the game, though the Japanese name for the game is different.

The name Roshambo or Rochambeau has been claimed to refer to Count Rochambeau, who allegedly played the game during the American Revolutionary War. The legend that he played the game is apocryphal, as all evidence points to the game being brought to the United States later than 1910; if this name has anything to do with him it is for some other reason. It is unclear why this name became associated with the game, with hypotheses ranging from a slight phonetic similarity with the Japanese name &quot;jan-ken-pon,&quot; to the presence of a statue of Rochambeau in a neighborhood of Washington, DC.

==Names==
The modern game is known by several other names such as Rochambeau, Roshambo, Ro-sham-bo, Bato Bato Pik, and Jak-en-poy. While the game&#x27;s name is a list of three items, different countries often have the list in a different order.

In North America and the United Kingdom, it is known as &quot;rock, paper, scissors&quot; or &quot;scissors, paper, stone&quot;. If this name is chanted while actually playing the game, it might be followed by an exclamation of &quot;shoot&quot; at the moment when the players are to reveal their choice (i.e. &quot;Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!&quot;).

In Australia, the most common name is &quot;scissors, paper, rock&quot; (the reverse of the American format). There have been claims that there are regional variations of the name in Australia; the video claimed that it was referred to as &quot;scissors, paper, rock&quot; in New South Wales, &quot;rock, paper, scissors&quot; in Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia and &quot;paper, scissors, rock&quot; in Queensland, though this has been disputed.

In New Zealand, the most common name in English is &quot;paper, scissors, rock&quot;. In Māori, it is known as ().

In France, the game is sometimes called Shifumi (sometimes spelled Chifoumi).

== Gameplay ==
The players may start by counting to three aloud, or by speaking the name of the game (e.g. &quot;Rock! Paper! Scissors!&quot;), raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down with each syllable onto their other hand (or in a less common variant, holding it behind their back). They then &quot;throw&quot; or &quot;shoot&quot; by extending their selected sign towards their opponent on what would have been the fourth count, often saying the word &quot;shoot&quot; while doing so. 

Variations include a version where players throw immediately on the third count (thus throwing on the count of &quot;Scissors!&quot;), a version including five counts rather than four (&quot;Rock! Paper! Scissors! Says! Shoot!&quot;, almost exclusively localized in the United States to Long Island and some parts of New York City), a version where players say “Scissors! Paper! Rock!”, and a version where players shake their hands three times before &quot;throwing&quot;.

== History ==

===Origins===

The first known mention of the game was in the book &quot;&quot; by the Ming-dynasty writer ( 1600), who wrote that the game dated back to the time of the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE). In the book, the game was called &quot;shoushiling&quot;. Li Rihua&#x27;s book &quot;Note of Liuyanzhai&quot; also mentions this game, calling it &quot;shoushiling&quot; (t. 手勢令; s. 手势令), &quot;huozhitou&quot; (t. 豁指頭; s. 豁指头), or &quot;huaquan&quot; (划拳).
From China the game was brought to Japan. Throughout Japanese history there are frequent references to &quot;sansukumi-ken&quot;, meaning &quot;ken&quot; (fist) games &quot;of the three who are afraid of one another&quot; (i.e. A beats B, B beats C, and C beats A).

The earliest &quot;sansukumi-ken&quot; in Japan was apparently &quot;mushi-ken&quot; (虫拳), a version imported directly from China. In &quot;mushi-ken&quot; the &quot;frog&quot; (represented by the thumb) triumphs over the &quot;slug&quot; (represented by the little finger), which, in turn prevails over the &quot;snake&quot; (represented by the index finger), which triumphs over the &quot;frog&quot;. (The Chinese and Japanese versions differ in the animals represented; in adopting the game, the Chinese characters for the venomous centipede (蜈蜙) were apparently confused with the characters for the slug (蛞蝓)).

The most popular &quot;sansukumi-ken&quot; game in Japan was &quot;kitsune-ken&quot; (狐拳). In this game, a fox (狐), often attributed supernatural powers in Japanese folklore, defeats the village head, the village head (庄屋) defeats the hunter, and the hunter (猟師) defeats the fox. &quot;Kitsune-ken&quot;, unlike &quot;mushi-ken&quot; or rock–paper–scissors, requires gestures with both hands.

Today, the best-known &quot;sansukumi-ken&quot; is called , which is a variation of the Chinese games introduced in the 17th century. &quot;Jan-ken&quot; uses the rock, paper, and scissors signs and is the direct source of the modern version of rock paper scissors. Hand-games using gestures to represent the three conflicting elements of rock, paper, and scissors have been most common since the modern version of the game was created in the late 19th century, between the Edo and Meiji periods.

=== Spread beyond East Asia ===
By the early 20th century, rock paper scissors had spread beyond East Asia, especially through increased Japanese contact with the west. Its English-language name is therefore taken from a translation of the names of the three Japanese hand-gestures for rock, paper and scissors; elsewhere in East Asia the open-palm gesture represents &quot;cloth&quot; rather than &quot;paper&quot;. The shape of the scissors is also adopted from the Japanese style.

A 1921 article about cricket in the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; described &quot;stone, scissors, and paper&quot; as a &quot;Teutonic method of drawing lots&quot;, which the writer &quot;came across when travelling on the Continent once&quot;. Another article, from the same year, the &quot;Washington Herald&quot; described it as a method of &quot;Chinese gambling&quot;.
In Britain in 1924 it was described in a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; as a hand game, possibly of Mediterranean origin, called &quot;zhot&quot;.
A reader then wrote in to say that the game &quot;zhot&quot; referred to was evidently Jan-ken-pon, which she had often seen played throughout Japan. Although at this date the game appears to have been new enough to British readers to need explaining, the appearance by 1927 of Gerard Fairlie″s popular thriller novel with the title &quot;Scissors Cut Paper&quot;, followed by Fairlie&#x27;s &quot;Stone Blunts Scissors&quot; (1929), suggests it quickly became popular.

The game is referred to in two of Hildegard G. Frey&#x27;s novels in the &quot;Campfire Girls&quot; series: &quot;The Campfire Girls Go Motoring&quot; (1916) and &quot;The Campfire Girls Larks and Pranks&quot; (1917), which suggests that it was known in America at least that early. The first passage where it appears says &quot;In order that no feelings might be involved in any way over which car we other girls traveled in, Nyoda, Solomon-like, proposed that she and Gladys play &#x27;John Kempo&#x27; for us. (That isn&#x27;t spelled right, but no matter.)&quot; There is no explanation in any of the places where it is referenced of what the game actually is. This suggests that the author at least believed that the game was well known enough in America that her readers would understand the reference.

In 1927 &quot;La Vie au patronage : organe catholique des œuvres de jeunesse&quot;, a children&#x27;s magazine in France, described it in detail, referring to it as a &quot;jeu japonais&quot; (&quot;Japanese game&quot;). Its French name, &quot;Chi-fou-mi&quot;, is based on the Old Japanese words for &quot;one, two, three&quot; (&quot;hi, fu, mi&quot;).

A 1932 &quot;New York Times&quot; article on the Tokyo rush hour describes the rules of the game for the benefit of American readers, suggesting it was not at that time widely known in the U.S. Likewise, the trick-taking card game “Jan-Ken-Po”, first published in 1934, describes the rules of the hand-game without mentioning any American game along the lines of “rock paper scissors”. The 1933 edition of the &quot;Compton&#x27;s Pictured Encyclopedia&quot; described it as a common method of settling disputes between children in its article on Japan; the name was given as &quot;John Kem Po&quot; and the article pointedly asserted, &quot;This is such a good way of deciding an argument that American boys and girls might like to practice it too.&quot;

== Strategies ==
It is impossible to gain an advantage over an opponent that chooses their move uniformly at random. However, it is possible to gain a significant advantage over a non-random player by predicting their move, which can be done by exploiting psychological effects or by analyzing statistical patterns of their past behavior. As a result, there have been programming competitions for algorithms that play rock paper scissors.

During tournaments, players often prepare their sequence of three gestures prior to the tournament&#x27;s commencement. Some tournament players employ tactics to confuse or trick the other player into making an illegal move, resulting in a loss. One such tactic is to shout the name of one move before throwing another, in order to misdirect and confuse their opponent.

The &quot;rock&quot; move, in particular, is notable in that it is typically represented by a closed fist—often identical to the fist made by players during the initial countdown. If a player is attempting to beat their opponent based on quickly reading their hand gesture as the players are making their moves, it is possible to determine if the opponent is about to throw &quot;rock&quot; based on their lack of hand movement, as both &quot;scissors&quot; and &quot;paper&quot; require the player to reposition their hand. This can likewise be used to deceive an anticipating opponent by keeping one&#x27;s fist closed until the last possible moment, leading them to believe that one is about to throw &quot;rock&quot;.

=== Algorithms ===
As a consequence of rock paper scissors programming contests, many strong algorithms have emerged. For example, Iocaine Powder, which won the First International RoShamBo Programming Competition in 1999, uses a heuristically designed compilation of strategies. For each strategy it employs, it also has six metastrategies which defeat second-guessing, triple-guessing, as well as second-guessing the opponent, and so on. The optimal strategy or metastrategy is chosen based on past performance. The main strategies it employs are history matching, frequency analysis, and random guessing. Its strongest strategy, history matching, searches for a sequence in the past that matches the last few moves in order to predict the next move of the algorithm. In frequency analysis, the program simply identifies the most frequently played move. The random guess is a fallback method that is used to prevent a devastating loss in the event that the other strategies fail. There have since been some innovations, such as using multiple history-matching schemes that each match a different aspect of the history – for example, the opponent&#x27;s moves, the program&#x27;s own moves, or a combination of both. There have also been other algorithms based on Markov chains.

In 2012, researchers from the Ishikawa Watanabe Laboratory at the University of Tokyo created a robot hand that can play rock paper scissors with a 100% win rate against a human opponent. Using a high-speed camera the robot recognizes within one millisecond which shape the human hand is making, then produces the corresponding winning shape.

There exist numerous cultural and personal variations on rock paper scissors. Differences vary from simply playing the same game with different objects to expanding into more weapons and rules. 

=== Different rules ===

In Korea, where the standard version of the game is called &quot;gawi-bawi-bo&quot;, a more complex version exists by the name &quot;muk-jji-ppa&quot;. After showing their hands, the player with the winning throw shouts &quot;&quot;muk-jji-ppa!&quot; upon which both players throw again. If they throw differently, whoever wins this second round shouts &quot;muk-jji-ppa!&quot;&quot; and thus the play continues until both players throw the same, at which point whoever was the last winner becomes the final winner. 

In &quot;rock paper scissors minus one&quot;, another popular variant in Korea, both players throw with both hands simultaneously. Each player chooses one hand to remove, and the winner is decided by the remaining hands in play; a tie leads to a replay. This variation was featured in the second season of the Netflix series &quot;Squid Game.&quot;

In Japan, a strip game variant of rock paper scissors is known as 野球拳 (&quot;Yakyuken&quot;). The loser of each round removes an article of clothing. The game is a minor part of porn culture in Japan and other Asian countries after the influence of TV variety shows and Soft On Demand.

In the Philippines, the game is called &quot;jak-en-poy&quot; (from the Japanese &quot;jankenpon&quot;). In a longer version of the game, a four-line song is sung, with hand gestures displayed at the end of each (or the final) line: &quot;Jack-en-poy! / Hali-hali-hoy! / Sino&#x27;ng matalo, / siya&#x27;ng unggoy!&quot; (&quot;Jack-en-poy! / Hali-hali-hoy! / Whoever loses is the monkey!&quot;) In the former case, the person with the most wins at the end of the song, wins the game. A shorter version of the game uses the chant &quot;Bato-bato-pick&quot; (&quot;Rock-rock-pick [i.e. choose]&quot;) instead.

A variation with more players can be played: Players stand in a circle and all throw at once. If rock, paper, and scissors are all thrown, it is a stalemate, and they rethrow. If only two throws are present, all players with the losing throw are eliminated. Play continues until only the winner remains.

=== Different weapons ===
In Indonesia, the game is called &quot;suten&quot;, &quot;suit&quot; or just &quot;sut&quot;, and the three signs are elephant (slightly raised thumb), human (outstreched index finger) and ant (outstreched pinky finger). Elephant is stronger than human, human is stronger than ant, but elephant is afraid of the ant.

Using the same tripartite division, there is a full-body variation in lieu of the hand signs called &quot;Bear, Hunter, Ninja&quot;. In this iteration the participants stand back-to-back and at the count of three (or ro-sham-bo as is traditional) turn around facing each other using their arms evoking one of the totems. The players&#x27; choices break down as: Hunter shoots bear; Bear eats ninja; Ninja kills hunter.

=== Additional weapons ===
Generalized rock-paper-scissors games where the players have a choice of more than three weapons have been studied. Any variation of rock paper scissors is an oriented graph, where the nodes represent the symbols (weapons) choosable by the players, and an edge from A to B means that A defeats B. Each oriented graph is a potentially playable rock paper scissors game. According to theoretical calculations, the number of distinguishable (i.e. not isomorphic) oriented graphs grows with the number of weapons = 3, 4, 5, ... as follows:
: 7, 42, 582, 21480, 2142288, 575016219, 415939243032, … .

The French game &quot;pierre, papier, ciseaux, puits&quot; (stone, paper, scissors, well) is unbalanced; both the stone and scissors fall in the well and lose to it, while paper covers both stone and well. This means two &quot;weapons&quot;, well and paper, can defeat two moves, while the other two weapons each defeat only one of the other three choices. The stone has no advantage to well, so optimal strategy is to play each of the other objects (paper, scissors and well) one-third of the time.
Variants in which the number of moves is an odd number and each move defeats exactly half of the other moves while being defeated by the other half are typically considered. Variations with up to 101 different moves have been published. Adding new gestures has the effect of reducing the odds of a tie, while increasing the complexity of the game. The probability of a tie in an odd-number-of-weapons game can be calculated based on the number of weapons &quot;n&quot; as 1/&quot;n&quot;, so the probability of a tie is 1/3 in standard rock paper scissors, but 1/5 in a version that offered five moves instead of three.

One popular five-weapon expansion is &quot;&quot;, invented by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, which adds &quot;Spock&quot; and &quot;lizard&quot; to the standard three choices. &quot;Spock&quot; is signified with the &quot;Star Trek&quot; Vulcan salute, while &quot;lizard&quot; is shown by forming the hand into a sock-puppet-like mouth. Spock smashes scissors and vaporizes rock; he is poisoned by lizard and disproved by paper. Lizard poisons Spock and eats paper; it is crushed by rock and decapitated by scissors. This variant was mentioned in a 2005 article in &quot;The Times&quot; of London and was later the subject of an episode of the American sitcom &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; in 2008 (as &quot;rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock&quot;).
A game-theoretic analysis showed that 4 variants of 582 possible variations using 5 different weapons have non-trivial mixed strategy equilibria. The most representative game of these 4 is &quot;rock, paper, scissors, fire, water&quot;. Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, scissors beats paper, fire beats everything except water, and water is beaten by everything except it beats fire. The perfect game-theoretic strategy is to use rock, paper, and scissors formula_1 of the time and formula_2 of the time for fire and water. Nevertheless, experiments show that people underuse water and overuse rock, paper, and scissors in this game.
== Analogues in real life ==

=== Lizard mating strategies ===

The common side-blotched lizard (&quot;Uta stansburiana&quot;) exhibits a rock paper scissors pattern in its mating strategies. Of its three throat color types of males, &quot;orange beats blue, blue beats yellow, and yellow beats orange&quot; in competition for females, which is similar to the rules of rock-paper-scissors.

=== Bacteria ===
Some bacteria also exhibit a rock paper scissors dynamic when they engage in antibiotic production. The theory for this finding was demonstrated by computer simulation and in the laboratory by Benjamin Kerr, working at Stanford University with Brendan Bohannan. Additional &quot;in vitro&quot; results demonstrate rock paper scissors dynamics in additional species of bacteria. Biologist Benjamin C. Kirkup Jr. demonstrated that these antibiotics, bacteriocins, were active as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; compete with each other in the intestines of mice, and that the rock paper scissors dynamics allowed for the continued competition among strains: antibiotic-producers defeat antibiotic-sensitives; antibiotic-resisters multiply and withstand and out-compete the antibiotic-producers, letting antibiotic-sensitives multiply and out-compete others; until antibiotic-producers multiply again.

Rock paper scissors is the subject of continued research in bacterial ecology and evolution. It is considered one of the basic applications of game theory and non-linear dynamics to bacteriology. Models of evolution demonstrate how intragenomic competition can lead to rock paper scissors dynamics from a relatively general evolutionary model. The general nature of this basic non-transitive model is widely applied in theoretical biology to explore bacterial ecology and evolution.

=== Mechanical devices and geometrical constructions ===
In the televised robot combat competition &quot;BattleBots&quot;, relations between &quot;lifters, which had wedged sides and could use forklift-like prongs to flip pure wedges&quot;, &quot;spinners, which were smooth, circular wedges with blades on their bottom side for disabling and breaking lifters&quot;, and &quot;pure wedges, which could still flip spinners&quot; are analogical to relations in rock paper scissors games and called &quot;robot Darwinism&quot;.

== Instances of usage ==
=== American court case ===
In 2006, American federal judge Gregory Presnell from the Middle District of Florida ordered opposing sides in a lengthy court case to settle a trivial (but lengthily debated) point over the appropriate place for a deposition using the game of rock paper scissors. The ruling in &quot;Avista Management v. Wausau Underwriters&quot; stated:

=== Auction house selection ===

In 2005, when Takashi Hashiyama, CEO of Japanese television equipment manufacturer Maspro Denkoh, decided to auction off the collection of Impressionist paintings owned by his corporation, including works by Paul Cézanne, Pablo Picasso, and Vincent van Gogh, he contacted two leading auction houses, Christie&#x27;s International and Sotheby&#x27;s Holdings, seeking their proposals on how they would bring the collection to the market as well as how they would maximize the profits from the sale. Both firms made elaborate proposals, but neither was persuasive enough to earn Hashiyama&#x27;s approval. Unwilling to split up the collection into separate auctions, Hashiyama asked the firms to decide between themselves who would hold the auction, which included Cézanne&#x27;s &quot;Large Trees Under the Jas de Bouffan&quot;, estimated to be worth between $12 million to $16 million.

The houses were unable to reach a decision. Hashiyama told the two firms to play rock paper scissors to decide who would get the rights to the auction, explaining that &quot;it probably looks strange to others, but I believe this is the best way to decide between two things which are equally good.&quot;

The auction houses had a weekend to come up with a choice of move. Christie&#x27;s went to the 11-year-old twin daughters of the international director of Christie&#x27;s Impressionist and Modern Art Department Nicholas Maclean, who suggested &quot;scissors&quot; because &quot;Everybody expects you to choose &#x27;rock&#x27;.&quot; Sotheby&#x27;s said that they treated it as a game of chance and had no particular strategy for the game, but went with &quot;paper&quot;. Christie&#x27;s won the match and sold the $20 million collection, earning millions of dollars of commission for the auction house.

=== FA Women&#x27;s Super League match ===
Prior to a 26 October 2018 match in the FA Women&#x27;s Super League, the referee, upon being without a coin for the pregame coin toss, had the team captains play rock paper scissors to determine which team would kick-off. The referee was subsequently suspended for three weeks by The Football Association.

=== Play by chimpanzees ===
In Japan, researchers have taught chimpanzees to identify winning hands according to the rules of rock paper scissors.

=== Game design ===

In many games, it is common for a group of possible choices to interact in a rock paper scissors style, where each selection is strong against a particular choice, but weak against another. Such mechanics can make a game somewhat self-balancing, prevent gameplay from being overwhelmed by a single dominant strategy and single dominant type of unit.

Many card-based video games in Japan use the rock paper scissors system as their core fighting system, with the winner of each round being able to carry out their designated attack. In &quot;Alex Kidd in Miracle World&quot;, the player has to win games of rock paper scissors against each boss to proceed. Others use simple variants of rock paper scissors as subgames.

Many Nintendo role-playing games prominently feature a rock paper scissors gameplay element. In &quot;Pokémon&quot;, there is a rock paper scissors element in the type effectiveness system. For example, a Grass-typed Pokémon is weak to Fire, Fire is weak to Water, and Water is weak to Grass. In the 3DS remake of &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Superstar Saga&quot; and &quot;Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser&#x27;s Inside Story&quot;, the battles in the second mode use a “Power Triangle” system based on the game&#x27;s three attack types: Melee, Ranged, and Flying. In the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series of strategy role-playing games, the Weapon Triangle and Trinity of Magic influence the hit and damage rates of weapon types based on whether they are at an advantage or a disadvantage in their respective rock paper scissors system. In the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series, the three basic actions used during battles are described in their respective rock paper scissors system: attack, defense, and grab.

The &quot;Card-Jitsu&quot; minigame in Club Penguin is a rock-paper-scissors game using cards that represent the three elements, Fire, Water and Snow. Fire beats snow, snow beats water, water beats fire.

== Tournaments ==

Various competitive rock paper scissors tournaments have been organised by different groups.

=== World Rock Paper Scissors Association ===

Started in 2015, the WRPSA has hosted Professional Rock Paper Scissors Tournaments all around the world.

=== World Rock Paper Scissors Society ===
The World Rock Paper Scissors Society hosted Professional Rock Paper Scissors Tournaments from 2002 to 2009. These open, competitive championships were widely attended by players from around the world and attracted widespread international media attention. WRPS events were noted for their large cash prizes, elaborate staging, and colorful competitors.
In 2004, the championships were broadcast on the U.S. television network Fox Sports Net (later known as Bally Sports), with the winner being Lee Rammage, who went on to compete in at least one subsequent championship. The 2007 tournament was won by Andrea Farina. The last tournament hosted by the World RPS Society was in Toronto, Canada, on November 14, 2009.

=== UK championships ===
Several RPS events have been organised in the United Kingdom by Wacky Nation. The 1st UK Championship took place on 13 July 2007, and were then held annually. The 2019 event was won by Ellie Mac, who went on to pick up the cash prize of £20,000 but was unable to double her earnings in 2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak.

=== USARPS tournaments ===
USA Rock Paper Scissors League is sponsored by Bud Light. Leo Bryan Pacis was the first commissioner of the USARPS. Cody Louis Brown was elected as the second commissioner of the USARPS in 2014.

In April 2006, the inaugural USARPS Championship was held in Las Vegas. Following months of regional qualifying tournaments held across the US, 257 players were flown to Las Vegas for a single-elimination tournament at the House of Blues where the winner received $50,000. The tournament was shown on the A&amp;E Network on 12 June 2006.

The $50,000 2007 USARPS Tournament took place at the Las Vegas Mandalay Bay in May 2007.

In 2008, Sean &quot;Wicked Fingers&quot; Sears beat 300 other contestants and walked out of the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino with $50,000 after defeating Julie &quot;Bulldog&quot; Crossley in the finals.

The inaugural Budweiser International Rock, Paper, Scissors Federation Championship was held in Beijing, China after the close of the 2008 Summer Olympics at Club Bud. A Belfast man won the competition.

=== National XtremeRPS Competition 2007–2008 ===
The XtremeRPS National Competition is a US nationwide RPS competition with Preliminary Qualifying contests that started in January 2007 and ended in May 2008, followed by regional finals in June and July 2008. The national finals were to be held in Des Moines, Iowa, in August 2008, with a chance to win up to $5,000.

=== &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; ===
The largest rock paper scissors tournament hosted 2,950 players and was achieved by Oomba, Inc. (USA) at Gen Con 2014 in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States, on 17 August 2014.

=== World Series ===
Former Celebrity Poker Showdown host and USARPS Head Referee Phil Gordon has hosted an annual $500 World Series of Rock Paper Scissors event in conjunction with the World Series of Poker since 2005. The winner of the WSORPS receives an entry into the WSOP Main Event. The event is an annual fundraiser for the &quot;Cancer Research and Prevention Foundation&quot; via Gordon&#x27;s charity &quot;Bad Beat on Cancer&quot;. Poker player Annie Duke won the Second Annual World Series of Rock Paper Scissors. The tournament is taped by ESPN and highlights are covered during &quot;The Nuts&quot; section of ESPN&#x27;s annual WSOP broadcast. 2009 was the fifth year of the tournament.

=== &quot;Jackpot En Poy&quot; of &quot;Eat Bulaga!&quot; ===
Jackpot En Poy is a game segment on the Philippines&#x27; longest running noontime variety show, &quot;Eat Bulaga!&quot;. The game is based on the classic children&#x27;s game rock paper scissors (Jak-en-poy in Filipino, derived from the Japanese Jan-ken-pon) where four players are paired to compete in the three-round segment. In the first round, the first pair plays against each other until one player wins three times. The next pair then plays against each other in the second round. The winners from the first two rounds then compete against each other to finally determine the ultimate winner. The winner of the game then moves on to the final round. In the final round, the player is presented with several Dabarkads, each holding different amounts of cash prize. The player will then pick three Dabarkads who they will play rock paper scissors against. The player plays against them one at a time. If the player wins against any of the &quot;Eat Bulaga!&quot; hosts, they will win the cash prize.

<doc id="27033" wikidata="Q777974" url="?curid=27033" title="Logudorese Sardinian">
<text>Logudorese Sardinian (, ) is one of the two written standards of the Sardinian language, which is often considered one of the most, if not the most conservative of all Romance languages. The orthography is based on the spoken dialects of central northern Sardinia, identified by certain attributes which are not found, or found to a lesser degree, among the Sardinian dialects centered on the other written form, Campidanese. Its ISO 639-3 code is &quot;src&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
Latin and before , are not palatalized in Logudorese, in stark contrast with all other Romance languages. Compare Logudorese &#x27; with Italian &#x27; , Spanish &#x27; and French &#x27; . Like the other varieties of Sardinian, most subdialects of Logudorese also underwent lenition in the intervocalic plosives of --, --, and --/ (e.g. Lat. &gt; &quot;fire&quot;, &gt; &quot;shore, bank&quot;, &gt; &quot;wheel&quot;). Finally, Logudorese shifts the Latin labiovelars and into medially and word-initially (Lat. &gt; &quot;tongue&quot;, &gt; &quot;what&quot;).

Logudorese is intelligible to those from the southern part of Sardinia, where Campidanese Sardinian is spoken, but it is not to those from the extreme north of the island, where Corsican–Sardinian dialects are spoken.

Sardinian is an autonomous linguistic group rather than an Italian dialect as it is often noted because of its morphological, syntactic, and lexical differences from Italian. Therefore, Italian speakers do not understand Logudorese or any other dialect of the Sardinian language.

==Location and distribution==
The area of Logudoro (the term originated as a blend of the kingdom&#x27;s name of Logu de Torres), in which it is spoken, is a northern subregion of the island of Sardinia with close ties to Ozieri (&quot;Othieri&quot;) and Nuoro (&quot;Nùgoro&quot;) for culture and language, as well as history, with important particularities in the western area, where the most important town is Ittiri. It is an area of roughly 150 × 100 km with some 500,000–700,000 inhabitants.

==Origins and features==
The origins of Sardinian have been investigated by Eduardo Blasco Ferrer and others. The language derives from Latin and a pre-Latin, Paleo-Sardinian (Nuragic) substratum, but has been influenced by Catalan and Spanish due to the dominion of the Crown of Aragon and later the Spanish Empire over the island. Logudorese is the northern macro-dialect of the Sardinian language, the southern macro-dialect being Campidanese, spoken in the southern half of the island. The two dialects share a clear common origin and history, but have experienced somewhat different developments.

Though the language is typically Romance, some words are not of Latin origin, and are of uncertain etymology. One such is &quot;nura&quot;, found in &quot;nuraghe&quot;, the main form of pre-Roman building, hence the term for the pre-Roman era as the Nuragic Period. Various place names similarly have roots that defy analysis.

Logudorese Sardinian changed only very slowly from Vulgar Latin compared to other Romance lects, showing certain notably conservative phonological features relative to other Romance languages.

For example, linguist Mario Pei in a 1949 paper measured Logudorese Sardinian&#x27;s accent vocalization as having diverged less from Vulgar Latin than had French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian, or Old Provençal. The paper emphasized, however, that it represented only &quot;a very elementary, incomplete and tentative demonstration&quot; of how statistical methods could measure linguistic change, assigned &quot;frankly arbitrary&quot; point values to various types of stressed-vowel change, and did not compare languages in the sample with respect to any characteristics other than stressed vowels, among other caveats.

Due to its conservatism, as well as the preservation of many works of traditional literature from the 15th century onwards, Logudorese is often considered to be the most prestigious variety of Sardinian.

==Samples of Text==

===Matthew 6:9-13===
===Jonah 1:4-9===

* Logudorese Sardinian

&quot;4&quot; Su Segnore però mandesit unu grande bentu in su mare: et facta est una tempestade manna in mare, et sa nae perigulaiat de si fracassare.
&quot;5&quot; Et timesint sos marineris, et clamesint sos homines ad su Deus ipsoro: et bettesint sas mercanzias, qui fint in sa nae, in mare, ad tales qui si allezerigheret da ipsas: et Jonas si que fit faladu ad s&#x27; internu de sa nae, et dormiat a somnu grae.
&quot;6&quot; Et s&#x27; accostesit ad ipsu su patronu, et li nesit: Et proite tue ti laxas opprimere dai su somnu? pesa, et invoca su Deus tou, si pro sorte si ammentet Deus de nois, et non morzamus.
&quot;7&quot; Et nesit s&#x27; unu ad s&#x27; ateru cumpagnu: Benide, et tiremus a sorte, et iscamus, proite custa istroscia siat ad nois. Et tiresint a sorte: et ruesit sa sorte subra Jonas.
&quot;8&quot; Et nesint ad ipsu: Inzitanos, pro quale motivu siat ruta ad nois custa istroscia: qual&#x27; est s&#x27; arte tua? de quale populu ses tue?
&quot;9&quot; Et nesit ad ipsos: Eo so Hebreu, et eo timo su Segnore Deus de su chelu, qui factesit su mare, et i sa terra.

* Latin

&quot;4&quot; Dominus autem misit ventum magnum in mare, et facta est tempestas magna in mari, et navis periclitabatur conteri. &quot;5&quot; Et timuerunt nautae et clamaverunt unusquisque ad deum suum et miserunt vasa, quae erant in navi, in mare, ut alleviaretur ab eis. Ionas autem descenderat ad interiora navis et, cum recubuisset, dormiebat sopore gravi. &quot;6&quot; Et accessit ad eum gubernator et dixit ei: &quot;Quid? Tu sopore deprimeris? Surge, invoca Deum tuum, si forte recogitet Deus de nobis, et non pereamus.&quot; &quot;7&quot; Et dixit unusquisque ad collegam suum: &quot;Venite, et mittamus sortes, ut sciamus quare hoc malum sit nobis.&quot; Et miserunt sortes, et cecidit sors super Ionam. &quot;8&quot; Et dixerunt ad eum: &quot;Indica nobis cuius causa malum istud sit nobis. Quod est opus tuum, et unde venis? Quae terra tua, et ex quo populo es tu?&quot; &quot;9&quot; Et dixit ad eos: &quot;Hebraeus ego sum et Dominum, Deum caeli, ego timeo, qui fecit mare et aridam.&quot;

* Italian

&quot;4&quot; Il scatenò un gran vento sul mare, e vi fu sul mare una tempesta così forte che la nave era sul punto di sfasciarsi. &quot;5&quot; I marinai ebbero paura e invocarono ciascuno il proprio dio e gettarono a mare il carico di bordo, per alleggerire la nave. Giona, invece, era sceso in fondo alla nave, si era coricato e dormiva profondamente. &quot;6&quot; Il capitano gli si avvicinò e gli disse: «Che fai qui? Dormi? Àlzati, invoca il tuo dio! Forse egli si darà pensiero di noi e non periremo». &quot;7&quot; Poi si dissero l’un l’altro: «Venite, tiriamo a sorte e sapremo per causa di chi ci capita questa disgrazia». Tirarono a sorte e la sorte cadde su Giona.
&quot;8&quot; Allora gli dissero: «Spiegaci dunque per causa di chi ci capita questa disgrazia! Qual è il tuo mestiere? Da dove vieni? Qual è il tuo paese? A quale popolo appartieni?» &quot;9&quot; Egli rispose loro: «Sono Ebreo e temo il , Dio del cielo, che ha fatto il mare e la terraferma».

* English
&quot;4&quot; However, the hurled a great wind on the sea and there was a great storm on the sea, so that the ship was about to break up. &quot;5&quot; Then the sailors became afraid and every man cried out to his god, and they hurled the cargo which was in the ship into the sea to lighten it for them. But Jonah had gone below into the stern of the ship, had lain down, and fallen sound asleep. &quot;6&quot; So the captain approached him and said, “How is it that you are sleeping? Get up, call on your god! Perhaps your god will be concerned about us so that we will not perish.”
&quot;7&quot; And each man said to his mate, “Come, let’s cast lots so that we may find out on whose account this catastrophe has struck us.” So they cast lots, and the lot fell on Jonah. &quot;8&quot; Then they said to him, “Tell us, now! On whose account has this catastrophe struck us? What is your occupation, and where do you come from? What is your country, and from what people are you?” &quot;9&quot; So he said to them, “I am a Hebrew, and I fear the God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land.”

==Subdialects==
Logudorese Sardinian has multiple subdialects, some confined to individual villages or valleys. Though such differences can be noticeable, the dialects are mutually intelligible, and share mutual intelligibility with the neighbouring Campidanese dialects as well.

===Northern Logudorese===
Spoken in the north of Sardinia, this subdialect contains the following features:
* , , changes to , , (Lat. &quot;plovere&quot; &gt; &quot;piòere&quot; &quot;rain&quot;, &quot;florem&quot; &gt; &quot;fiore&quot; &quot;flower&quot;, &quot;clavem&quot; &gt; &quot;kiae&quot; &quot;key&quot;);
* &gt; in an intervocalic, pre-consonantal position (Northern &quot;Saldigna&quot; vs Southern &quot;Sardigna&quot;).

===Central (Common) Logudorese===
Spoken in Central Sardinia, this subdialect contains the following features:
* , , changes to , , (Lat. &quot;plovere&quot; &gt; &quot;pròere&quot; &quot;rain&quot;, &quot;florem&quot; &gt; &quot;frore&quot; &quot;flower&quot;, &quot;clavem&quot; &gt; &quot;crae&quot; &quot;key&quot;);
* &gt; in an intervocalic, pre-consonantal position (Northern &quot;altu&quot; vs Southern &quot;artu&quot; &quot;high&quot;).

===Nuorese===
The Nuorese dialect is spoken in three historical regions: Baronìa, Nuorese and Barbàgia of Ollolài. The three sub-varieties are quite different from one another, and each one of them includes some distinctive features not found anywhere else in Sardinia, many of which demonstrate the conservative nature of these dialects:
*No lenition of intervocalic plosives (e.g. Lat. &quot;focum&quot; &gt; &quot;focu&quot; &quot;fire&quot;, &quot;ripa&quot; &gt; &quot;ripa&quot; &quot;shore, bank&quot;, &quot;rota&quot; &gt; &quot;rota&quot; &quot;wheel&quot; – Barbagian : &quot;ròda&quot;);
*No palatal realisation of and , instead turning into and , respectively (e.g. Lat. &quot;Sardinia&quot; &gt; &quot;Sardinna&quot; and &quot;folium&quot; &gt; &quot;foza&quot; &quot;leaf&quot;);
*Preservation of intervocalic , , and (Lat. &quot;augustus&quot; &quot;August&quot; &gt; Log. &quot;austu&quot; but Nuo. &quot;agustu&quot;, Lat. &quot;credere&quot; &quot;to believe&quot; &gt; Log. &quot;creere&quot; but Nuo. &quot;credere&quot;, Lat. &quot;novem&quot; &quot;nine&quot; &gt; Log. &quot;noe&quot; vs Nuo. &quot;nobe&quot;/&quot;nove&quot; &lt; &quot;nove&quot;);
*Deletion of the initial &quot;f&quot;, except when preceded by other consonants – and in the local dialects spoken in the towns of Nuoro and Ottàna (e.g. &quot;ocu&quot; &quot;fire&quot;, &quot;àchere&quot; &quot;to do&quot;);
*Baronìa: presence of the conjugations that end in &quot;-ta&quot; and &quot;-tu&quot; (e.g. &quot;tancatu&quot; &quot;closed&quot;; &quot;achirratu&quot; &quot;went down&quot;; &quot;baitatu&quot; &quot;watched&quot;; &quot;mutitu&quot; &quot;called&quot;);
*Barbàgia di Ollolài: conjugations end in &quot;-à&quot; (instead of &quot;-ada&quot;) and &quot;-u&quot; (e.g. &quot;nau/narau&quot; &quot;said&quot;; &quot;mutiu&quot; &quot;called&quot;); presence of glottal stops in place of the hard c (&quot;k&quot;) found in the other Nuorese dialects (e.g. &quot;inohe&quot; &quot;here&quot;; &quot;ohu&quot; &quot;fire&quot;; &quot;àhere&quot; &quot;to do&quot;; &quot;hitho&quot; &quot;early&quot;; &quot;vohe&quot; &quot;voice&quot;);
*Persistence of the Latin pronouns: Lat. &quot;ego&quot; &gt; &quot;jeo, eo, ego, dego&quot; (the latter being once used in the city of Nuoro, and with the form &quot;ego&quot; most prominently used in the towns of Olièna, Gavòi and Ollolài, less frequent but still present in the village of Mamoiàda); Lat. &quot;ipse&quot; &gt; &quot;issu, isse&quot; (particularly in the villages of Bitti and Onanì);
*Betacism of in Nuoro but not in Baronia and Barbàgia;
*Latin before yod to in Nuorese (&quot;plateam&quot; &quot;square, courtyard&quot; &gt; &quot;pratha&quot;), albeit in some places the sound is in the process of becoming (&quot;pratza&quot;).
==Writers==

A large body of Sardinian poetry, songs and literature is composed in Logudorese.
