<text>Linguistic relativity asserts that language influences worldview or cognition. One form of linguistic relativity, linguistic determinism, regards peoples&#x27; languages as determining and influencing the scope of cultural perceptions of their surrounding world.

Several various colloquialisms refer to linguistic relativism: the Whorf hypothesis; the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis ( ); the Whorf-Sapir hypothesis; and Whorfianism.

The hypothesis is in dispute, with many different variations throughout its history. The &quot;strong hypothesis&quot; of linguistic relativity, now referred to as linguistic determinism, is that language &quot;determines&quot; thought and that linguistic categories limit and restrict cognitive categories. This was a claim by some earlier linguists pre-World War II; 
since then it has fallen out of acceptance by contemporary linguists. Nevertheless, research has produced positive empirical evidence supporting a &quot;weaker&quot; version of linguistic relativity: that a language&#x27;s structures influence a speaker&#x27;s perceptions, without strictly limiting or obstructing them.

Although common, the term &quot;Sapir–Whorf hypothesis&quot; is sometimes considered a misnomer for several reasons. Edward Sapir (1884–1939) and Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897–1941) never co-authored any works and never stated their ideas in terms of a hypothesis. The distinction between a weak and a strong version of this hypothesis is also a later development; Sapir and Whorf never used such a dichotomy, although often their writings and their opinions of this relativity principle expressed it in stronger or weaker terms.

The principle of linguistic relativity and the relationship between language and thought has also received attention in varying academic fields, including philosophy, psychology and anthropology. It has also influenced works of fiction and the invention of constructed languages.

== History ==

The idea was first expressed explicitly by 19th-century thinkers such as Wilhelm von Humboldt and Johann Gottfried Herder, who considered language as the expression of the spirit of a nation. Members of the early 20th-century school of American anthropology including Franz Boas and Edward Sapir also approved versions of the idea to a certain extent, including in a 1928 meeting of the Linguistic Society of America, but Sapir, in particular, wrote more often against than in favor of anything like linguistic determinism. Sapir&#x27;s student, Benjamin Lee Whorf, came to be considered as the primary proponent as a result of his published observations of how he perceived linguistic differences to have consequences for human cognition and behavior. Harry Hoijer, another of Sapir&#x27;s students, introduced the term &quot;Sapir–Whorf hypothesis&quot;, even though the two scholars never formally advanced any such hypothesis. A strong version of relativist theory was developed from the late 1920s by the German linguist Leo Weisgerber. Whorf&#x27;s principle of linguistic relativity was reformulated as a testable hypothesis by Roger Brown and Eric Lenneberg who performed experiments designed to determine whether color perception varies between speakers of languages that classified colors differently.

As the emphasis of the universal nature of human language and cognition developed during the 1960s, the idea of linguistic relativity became disfavored among linguists. From the late 1980s, a new school of linguistic relativity scholars has examined the effects of differences in linguistic categorization on cognition, finding broad support for non-deterministic versions of the hypothesis in experimental contexts. Some effects of linguistic relativity have been shown in several semantic domains, although they are generally weak. Currently, a nuanced opinion of linguistic relativity is espoused by most linguists holding that language influences certain kinds of cognitive processes in non-trivial ways, but that other processes are better considered as developing from connectionist factors. Research emphasizes exploring the manners and extent to which language influences thought.

=== Ancient philosophy to the Enlightenment ===
The idea that language and thought are intertwined is ancient. In his dialogue Cratylus, Plato explores the idea that conceptions of reality, such as Heraclitean flux, are embedded in language. But Plato has been read as arguing against sophist thinkers such as Gorgias of Leontini, who claimed that the physical world cannot be experienced except through language; this made the question of truth dependent on aesthetic preferences or functional consequences. Plato may have held instead that the world consisted of eternal ideas and that language should represent these ideas as accurately as possible. Nevertheless, Plato&#x27;s Seventh Letter claims that ultimate truth is inexpressible in words.

Following Plato, St. Augustine, for example, argued that language was merely like labels applied to concepts existing already. This opinion remained prevalent throughout the Middle Ages. Roger Bacon had the opinion that language was but a veil covering eternal truths, hiding them from human experience. For Immanuel Kant, language was but one of several methods used by humans to experience the world.

=== German Romantic philosophers ===
During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the idea of the existence of different national characters, or &quot;Volksgeister&quot;, of different ethnic groups was a major motivator for the German romantics school and the beginning ideologies of ethnic nationalism.

==== Johann Georg Hamann ====
Johann Georg Hamann is often suggested to be the first among the actual German Romantics to discuss the concept of the &quot;genius&quot; of a language. In his &quot;Essay Concerning an Academic Question&quot;, Hamann suggests that a people&#x27;s language affects their worldview:

==== Wilhelm von Humboldt ====
 In 1820, Wilhelm von Humboldt associated the study of language with the national romanticist program by proposing that language is the fabric of thought. Thoughts are produced as a kind of internal dialog using the same grammar as the thinker&#x27;s native language. This opinion was part of a greater idea in which the assumptions of an ethnic nation, their &quot;Weltanschauung&quot;, was considered as being represented by the grammar of their language. Von Humboldt argued that languages with an inflectional morphological type, such as German, English and the other Indo-European languages, were the most perfect languages and that accordingly this explained the dominance of their speakers with respect to the speakers of less perfect languages. Wilhelm von Humboldt declared in 1820:

In Humboldt&#x27;s humanistic understanding of linguistics, each language creates the individual&#x27;s worldview in its particular way through its lexical and grammatical categories, conceptual organization, and syntactic models.

Herder worked alongside Hamann to establish the idea of whether or not language had a human/rational or a divine origin. Herder added the emotional component of the hypothesis and Humboldt then took this information and applied to various languages to expand on the hypothesis.

=== Boas and Sapir ===

The idea that some languages are superior to others and that lesser languages maintained their speakers in intellectual poverty was widespread during the early 20th century. American linguist William Dwight Whitney, for example, actively strove to eradicate Native American languages, arguing that their speakers were savages and would be better off learning English and adopting a &quot;civilized&quot; way of life. The first anthropologist and linguist to challenge this opinion was Franz Boas. While performing geographical research in northern Canada he became fascinated with the Inuit and decided to become an ethnographer. Boas stressed the equal worth of all cultures and languages, that there was no such thing as a primitive language and that all languages were capable of expressing the same content, albeit by widely differing means. Boas saw language as an inseparable part of culture and he was among the first to require of ethnographers to learn the native language of the culture to be studied and to document verbal culture such as myths and legends in the original language.

Boas:

Boas&#x27; student Edward Sapir referred to the Humboldtian idea that languages were a major factor for understanding the cultural assumptions of peoples. He espoused the opinion that because of the differences in the grammatical systems of languages no two languages were similar enough to allow for perfect cross-translation. Sapir also thought because language represented reality differently, it followed that the speakers of different languages would perceive reality differently.

Sapir:

However, Sapir explicitly rejected strong linguistic determinism by stating, &quot;It would be naïve to imagine that any analysis of experience is dependent on pattern expressed in language.&quot;

Sapir was explicit that the associations between language and culture were neither extensive nor particularly profound, if they existed at all:

Sapir offered similar observations about speakers of so-called &quot;world&quot; or &quot;modern&quot; languages, noting, &quot;possession of a common language is still and will continue to be a smoother of the way to a mutual understanding between England and America, but it is very clear that other factors, some of them rapidly cumulative, are working powerfully to counteract this leveling influence. A common language cannot indefinitely set the seal on a common culture when the geographical, physical, and economics determinants of the culture are no longer the same throughout the area.&quot;

While Sapir never made a practice of studying directly how languages affected thought, some notion of (probably &quot;weak&quot;) linguistic relativity affected his basic understanding of language, and would be developed by Whorf.

=== Independent developments in Europe ===
Drawing on influences such as Humboldt and Friedrich Nietzsche, some European thinkers developed ideas similar to those of Sapir and Whorf, generally working in isolation from each other. Prominent in Germany from the late 1920s through the 1960s were the strongly relativist theories of Leo Weisgerber and his concept of a &#x27;linguistic inter-world&#x27;, mediating between external reality and the forms of a given language, in ways peculiar to that language. Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky read Sapir&#x27;s work and experimentally studied the ways in which the development of concepts in children was influenced by structures given in language. His 1934 work &quot;Thought and Language&quot; has been compared to Whorf&#x27;s and taken as mutually supportive evidence of language&#x27;s influence on cognition. Drawing on Nietzsche&#x27;s ideas of perspectivism Alfred Korzybski developed the theory of general semantics that has been compared to Whorf&#x27;s notions of linguistic relativity. Though influential in their own right, this work has not been influential in the debate on linguistic relativity, which has tended to be based on the American paradigm exemplified by Sapir and Whorf.

=== Benjamin Lee Whorf ===
More than any linguist, Benjamin Lee Whorf has become associated with what he termed the &quot;linguistic relativity principle&quot;. Studying Native American languages, he attempted to account for the ways in which grammatical systems and language-use differences affected perception. Whorf&#x27;s opinions regarding the nature of the relation between language and thought remain under contention. However, a version of theory holds some &quot;merit&quot;, for example, &quot;different words mean different things in different languages; not every word in every language has a one-to-one exact translation in a different language&quot; Critics such as Lenneberg, Black, and Pinker attribute to Whorf a strong linguistic determinism, while Lucy, Silverstein and Levinson point to Whorf&#x27;s explicit rejections of determinism, and where he contends that translation and commensuration are possible.

Detractors such as Lenneberg, Chomsky and Pinker criticized him for insufficient clarity of his description of how language influences thought, and for not proving his conjectures. Most of his arguments were in the form of anecdotes and speculations that served as attempts to show how &quot;exotic&quot; grammatical traits were associated with what were apparently equally exotic worlds of thought. In Whorf&#x27;s words:

=== Several terms for a single concept ===
Among Whorf&#x27;s best-known examples of linguistic relativity are instances where a non-European language has several terms for a concept that is only described with one word in European languages (Whorf used the acronym SAE &quot;Standard Average European&quot; to allude to the rather similar grammatical structures of the well-studied European languages in contrast to the greater diversity of less-studied languages).

One of Whorf&#x27;s examples was the supposedly large number of words for &#x27;snow&#x27; in the Inuit languages, an example that later was contested as a misrepresentation.

Another is the Hopi language&#x27;s words for water, one indicating drinking water in a container and another indicating a natural body of water.

These examples of polysemy served the double purpose of showing that non-European languages sometimes made more specific semantic distinctions than European languages and that direct translation between two languages, even of seemingly basic concepts such as snow or water, is not always possible.

Another example is from Whorf&#x27;s experience as a chemical engineer working for an insurance company as a fire inspector. While inspecting a chemical plant he observed that the plant had two storage rooms for gasoline barrels, one for the full barrels and one for the empty ones. He further noticed that while no employees smoked cigarettes in the room for full barrels, no-one minded smoking in the room with empty barrels, although this was potentially much more dangerous because of the flammable vapors still in the barrels. He concluded that the use of the word &quot;empty&quot; in association to the barrels had resulted in the workers unconsciously regarding them as harmless, although consciously they were probably aware of the risk of explosion. This example was later criticized by Lenneberg as not actually demonstrating causality between the use of the word &quot;empty&quot; and the action of smoking, but instead was an example of circular reasoning. Pinker in &quot;The Language Instinct&quot; ridiculed this example, claiming that this was a failing of human insight rather than language.

=== Time in Hopi ===
Whorf&#x27;s most elaborate argument for linguistic relativity regarded what he believed to be a fundamental difference in the understanding of time as a conceptual category among the Hopi. He argued that in contrast to English and other SAE languages, Hopi does not treat the flow of time as a sequence of distinct, countable instances, like &quot;three days&quot; or &quot;five years&quot;, but rather as a single process and that consequently it has no nouns referring to units of time as SAE speakers understand them. He proposed that this view of time was fundamental to Hopi culture and explained certain Hopi behavioral patterns.

Ekkehart Malotki later claimed that he had found no evidence of Whorf&#x27;s claims in 1980&#x27;s era Hopi speakers, nor in historical documents dating back to the arrival of Europeans. Malotki used evidence from archaeological data, calendars, historical documents, and modern speech; he concluded that there was no evidence that Hopi conceptualize time in the way Whorf suggested. Many universalist scholars such as Pinker consider Malotki&#x27;s study as a final refutation of Whorf&#x27;s claim about Hopi, whereas relativist scholars such as John A Lucy and Penny Lee criticized Malotki&#x27;s study for mischaracterizing Whorf&#x27;s claims and for forcing Hopi grammar into a model of analysis that does not fit the data.

=== Structure-centered approach ===
Whorf&#x27;s argument about Hopi speakers&#x27; conceptualization of time is an example of the structure-centered method of research into linguistic relativity, which Lucy identified as one of three main types of research of the topic. The &quot;structure-centered&quot; method starts with a language&#x27;s structural peculiarity and examines its possible ramifications for thought and behavior. The defining example is Whorf&#x27;s observation of discrepancies between the grammar of time expressions in Hopi and English. More recent research in this vein is Lucy&#x27;s research describing how usage of the categories of grammatical number and of numeral classifiers in the Mayan language Yucatec result in Mayan speakers classifying objects according to material rather than to shape as preferred by English speakers. However, philosophers including Donald Davidson and Jason Josephson Storm have argued that Whorf&#x27;s Hopi examples are self-refuting, as Whorf had to translate Hopi terms into English in order to explain how they are untranslatable.

=== Whorf dies ===
Whorf died in 1941 at age 44, leaving multiple unpublished papers. His ideas were continued by linguists and anthropologists such as Hoijer and Lee, who both continued investigating the effect of language on habitual thought, and Trager, who prepared a number of Whorf&#x27;s papers for posthumous publishing. The most important event for the dissemination of Whorf&#x27;s ideas to a larger public was the publication in 1956 of his major writings on the topic of linguistic relativity in a single volume titled &quot;Language, Thought and Reality&quot;.

=== Brown and Lenneberg ===
In 1953, Eric Lenneberg criticized Whorf&#x27;s examples from an objectivist philosophy of language, claiming that languages are principally meant to represent events in the real world, and that even though languages express these ideas in various ways, the meanings of such expressions and therefore the thoughts of the speaker are equivalent. He argued that Whorf&#x27;s English descriptions of a Hopi speaker&#x27;s idea of time were in fact translations of the Hopi concept into English, therefore disproving linguistic relativity. However Whorf was concerned with how the habitual &quot;use&quot; of language influences habitual behavior, rather than translatability. Whorf&#x27;s point was that while English speakers may be able to &quot;understand&quot; how a Hopi speaker thinks, they do not &quot;think&quot; in that way.

Lenneberg&#x27;s main criticism of Whorf&#x27;s works was that he never showed the necessary association between a linguistic phenomenon and a mental phenomenon. With Brown, Lenneberg proposed that proving such an association required directly matching linguistic phenomena with behavior. They assessed linguistic relativity experimentally and published their findings in 1954. Since neither Sapir nor Whorf had ever stated a formal hypothesis, Brown and Lenneberg formulated their own. Their two tenets were (i) &quot;the world is differently experienced and conceived in different linguistic communities&quot; and (ii) &quot;language causes a particular cognitive structure&quot;. Brown later developed them into the so-called &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong&quot; formulation:
* Structural differences between language systems will, in general, be paralleled by nonlinguistic cognitive differences, of an unspecified sort, in the native speakers of the language.
* The structure of anyone&#x27;s native language strongly influences or fully determines the worldview he will acquire as he learns the language.
Brown&#x27;s formulations became known widely and were retrospectively attributed to Whorf and Sapir although the second formulation, verging on linguistic determinism, was never advanced by either of them.

=== Joshua Fishman&#x27;s &quot;Whorfianism of the third kind&quot; ===
Joshua Fishman argued that Whorf&#x27;s true assertion was largely overlooked. In 1978, he suggested that Whorf was a &quot;neo-Herderian champion&quot; and in 1982, he proposed &quot;Whorfianism of the third kind&quot; in an attempt to reemphasize what he claimed was Whorf&#x27;s real interest, namely the intrinsic value of &quot;little peoples&quot; and &quot;little languages&quot;. Whorf had criticized Ogden&#x27;s Basic English thus:

Where Brown&#x27;s weak version of the linguistic relativity hypothesis proposes that language &quot;influences&quot; thought and the strong version that language &quot;determines&quot; thought, Fishman&#x27;s &quot;Whorfianism of the third kind&quot; proposes that language &quot;is a key to culture&quot;.

=== Leiden school ===
The Leiden school is a linguistic theory that models languages as parasites. Notable proponent Frederik Kortlandt, in a 1985 paper outlining Leiden school theory, advocates for a form of linguistic relativity: &quot;The observation that in all Yuman languages the word for &#x27;work&#x27; is a loan from Spanish should be a major blow to any current economic theory.&quot; In the next paragraph, he quotes directly from Sapir: &quot;Even in the most primitive cultures the strategic word is likely to be more powerful than the direct blow.&quot;

=== &quot;Rethinking Linguistic Relativity&quot; ===
The publication of the 1996 anthology &quot;Rethinking Linguistic Relativity&quot; edited by Gumperz and Levinson began a new period of linguistic relativity studies that emphasized cognitive and social aspects. The book included studies on linguistic relativity and universalist traditions. Levinson documented significant linguistic relativity effects in the different linguistic conceptualization of spatial categories in different languages. For example, men speaking the Guugu Yimithirr language in Queensland gave accurate navigation instructions using a compass-like system of north, south, east and west, along with a hand gesture pointing to the starting direction.

Lucy defines this method as &quot;domain-centered&quot; because researchers select a semantic domain and compare it across linguistic and cultural groups. Space is another semantic domain that has proven fruitful for linguistic relativity studies. Spatial categories vary greatly across languages. Speakers rely on the linguistic conceptualization of space in performing many ordinary tasks. Levinson and others reported three basic spatial categorizations. While many languages use combinations of them, some languages exhibit only one type and related behaviors. For example, Yimithirr only uses absolute directions when describing spatial relations—the position of everything is described by using the cardinal directions. Speakers define a location as &quot;north of the house&quot;, while an English speaker may use relative positions, saying &quot;in front of the house&quot; or &quot;to the left of the house&quot;.

Separate studies by Bowerman and Slobin analyzed the role of language in cognitive processes. Bowerman showed that certain cognitive processes did not use language to any significant extent and therefore could not be subject to linguistic relativity. Slobin described another kind of cognitive process that he named &quot;thinking for speaking&quot;—- the kind of process in which perceptional data and other kinds of prelinguistic cognition are translated into linguistic terms for communication. These, Slobin argues, are the kinds of cognitive process that are the basis of linguistic relativity.

== Colour terminology ==
=== Brown and Lenneberg ===
Since Brown and Lenneberg believed that the objective reality denoted by language was the same for speakers of all languages, they decided to test how different languages codified the same message differently and whether differences in codification could be proven to affect behavior. Brown and Lenneberg designed experiments involving the codification of colors. In their first experiment, they investigated whether it was easier for speakers of English to remember color shades for which they had a specific name than to remember colors that were not as easily definable by words. This allowed them to compare the linguistic categorization directly to a non-linguistic task. In a later experiment, speakers of two languages that categorize colors differently (English and Zuni) were asked to recognize colors. In this manner, it could be determined whether the differing color categories of the two speakers would determine their ability to recognize nuances within color categories. Brown and Lenneberg found that Zuni speakers who classify green and blue together as a single color did have trouble recognizing and remembering nuances within the green/blue category. This method, which Lucy later classified as domain-centered, is acknowledged to be sub-optimal, because color perception, unlike other semantic domains, is hardwired into the neural system and as such is subject to more universal restrictions than other semantic domains.

=== Hugo Magnus ===
In a similar study done by German ophthalmologist Hugo Magnus during the 1870s, he circulated a questionnaire to missionaries and traders with ten standardized color samples and instructions for using them. These instructions contained an explicit warning that failure of a language to distinguish lexically between two colors did not necessarily imply that speakers of that language did not distinguish the two colors perceptually. Magnus received completed questionnaires on twenty-five African, fifteen Asian, three Australian, and two European languages. He concluded in part, &quot;As regards the range of the color sense of the primitive peoples tested with our questionnaire, it appears in general to remain within the same bounds as the color sense of the civilized nations. At least, we could not establish a complete lack of the perception of the so-called main colors as a special racial characteristic of any one of the tribes investigated for us. We consider red, yellow, green, and blue as the main representatives of the colors of long and short wavelength; among the tribes we tested not a one lacks the knowledge of any of these four colors&quot; (Magnus 1880, p. 6, as trans. in Berlin and Kay 1969, p. 141). Magnus did find widespread lexical neutralization of green and blue, that is, a single word covering both these colors, as have all subsequent comparative studies of color lexicons.

=== Response to Brown and Lenneberg&#x27;s study ===
Brown and Lenneberg&#x27;s study began a tradition of investigation of linguistic relativity through color terminology. The studies showed a correlation between color term numbers and ease of recall in both Zuni and English speakers. Researchers attributed this to focal colors having greater codability than less focal colors, and not with linguistic relativity effects. Berlin/Kay found universal typological color principles that are determined by biological rather than linguistic factors. This study sparked studies into typological universals of color terminology. Researchers such as Lucy, Saunders and Levinson argued that Berlin and Kay&#x27;s study does not refute linguistic relativity in color naming, because of unsupported assumptions in their study (such as whether all cultures in fact have a clearly defined category of &quot;color&quot;) and because of related data problems. Researchers such as Maclaury continued investigation into color naming. Like Berlin and Kay, Maclaury concluded that the domain is governed mostly by physical-biological universals.

=== Berlin and Kay ===
Studies by Berlin and Kay continued Lenneberg&#x27;s color research. They studied color terminology formation and showed clear universal trends in color naming. For example, they found that even though languages have different color terminologies, they generally recognize certain hues as more focal than others. They showed that in languages with few color terms, it is predictable from the number of terms which hues are chosen as focal colors: For example, languages with only three color terms always have the focal colors black, white, and red. The fact that what had been believed to be random differences between color naming in different languages could be shown to follow universal patterns was seen as a powerful argument against linguistic relativity. Berlin and Kay&#x27;s research has since been criticized by relativists such as Lucy, who argued that Berlin and Kay&#x27;s conclusions were skewed by their insistence that color terms encode only color information. This, Lucy argues, made them unaware of the instances in which color terms provided other information that might be considered examples of linguistic relativity.

== Universalism ==

Universalist scholars began a period of dissent from ideas about linguistic relativity. Lenneberg was one of the first cognitive scientists to begin development of the Universalist theory of language that was formulated by Chomsky as universal grammar, effectively arguing that all languages share the same underlying structure. The Chomskyan school also includes the belief that linguistic structures are largely innate and that what are perceived as differences between specific languages are surface phenomena that do not affect the brain&#x27;s universal cognitive processes. This theory became the dominant paradigm of American linguistics from the 1960s through the 1980s, while linguistic relativity became the object of ridicule.

=== Ekkehart Malotki ===
Other universalist researchers dedicated themselves to dispelling other aspects of linguistic relativity, often attacking Whorf&#x27;s specific examples. For example, Malotki&#x27;s monumental study of time expressions in Hopi presented many examples that challenged Whorf&#x27;s &quot;timeless&quot; interpretation of Hopi language and culture, but seemingly failed to address the linguistic relativist argument actually posed by Whorf (i.e. that the understanding of time by native Hopi speakers differed from that of speakers of European languages due to the differences in the organization and construction of their respective languages; Whorf never claimed that Hopi speakers lacked any concept of time). Malotki himself acknowledges that the conceptualizations are different, but because he ignores Whorf&#x27;s use of quotes around the word &quot;time&quot; and the qualifier &quot;what we call&quot;, takes Whorf to be arguing that the Hopi have no concept of time at all.

=== Steven Pinker ===
Currently many believers of the universalist school of thought still oppose linguistic relativity. For example, Pinker argues in &quot;The Language Instinct&quot; that thought is independent of language, that language is itself meaningless in any fundamental way to human thought, and that human beings do not even think in &quot;natural&quot; language, i.e. any language that we actually communicate in; rather, we think in a meta-language, preceding any natural language, termed &quot;mentalese&quot;. Pinker attacks what he terms &quot;Whorf&#x27;s radical position&quot;, declaring, &quot;the more you examine Whorf&#x27;s arguments, the less sense they make&quot;.

Pinker and other universalists have been accused by relativists of misrepresenting Whorf&#x27;s ideas and committing the Strawman fallacy.

== Cognitive linguistics ==
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, advances in cognitive psychology and cognitive linguistics renewed interest in the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis. One of those who adopted a more Whorfian philosophy was George Lakoff. He argued that language is often used metaphorically and that languages use different cultural metaphors that reveal something about how speakers of that language think. For example, English employs conceptual metaphors likening time to money, so that time can be saved and spent and invested, whereas other languages do not talk about time in that manner. Other such metaphors are common to many languages because they are based on general human experience, for example, metaphors associating &quot;up&quot; with &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; with &quot;down&quot;. Lakoff also argued that metaphor plays an important part in political debates such as the &quot;right to life&quot; or the &quot;right to choose&quot;; or &quot;illegal aliens&quot; or &quot;undocumented workers&quot;.

An unpublished study by Boroditsky et al. in 2003 reported to have found empirical evidence favoring the hypothesis demonstrating that differences in the grammatical gender systems of languages can affect the way speakers of those languages think about objects. Speakers of Spanish and German, which have different gender systems, were asked to use adjectives to describe various objects that were either masculine or feminine in their respective languages. They reported that speakers tended to describe objects in ways that were consistent with the gender of the noun in their language, indicating that the gender system of a language can influence speakers&#x27; perceptions of objects. Despite numerous citations, the experiment was criticised after the reported effects could not be replicated by independent trials. Additionally, a large-scale data analysis using word embeddings of language models found no correlation between adjectives and inanimate noun genders, while another study using large text corpora found a slight correlation between the gender of animate and inanimate nouns and their adjectives as well as verbs by measuring their mutual information.

Colin Murray Turbayne also argued that the pervasive use of ancient &quot;dead metaphors&quot; by researchers within different linguistic traditions has contributed to needless confusion in the development of modern empirical theories over time. He points to several examples within the Romantic and Germanic languages of the subtle manner in which mankind has become unknowingly victimized by such &quot;unmasked metaphors.&quot; They include the incorporation of mechanistic metaphors first introduced by Rene Descartes and Isaac Newton during the 17th century into scientific theories which were subsequently developed by George Berkeley, David Hume and Immanuel Kant during the 18th century. and the influence exerted by Platonic metaphors in the dialogue &quot;Timaeus&quot; upon the development of contemporary theories of &quot;language&quot; in modern times. 

=== Parameters ===
In his book &quot;Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About the Mind&quot;, Lakoff reappraised linguistic relativity and especially Whorf&#x27;s ideas about how linguistic categorization represents and/or influences mental categories. He concluded that the debate had been confused. He described four parameters on which researchers differed in their opinions about what constitutes linguistic relativity:

* The degree and intensity of linguistic relativity. Perhaps a few examples of superficial differences in language and associated behavior are enough to demonstrate the existence of linguistic relativity. Alternatively, perhaps only great differences that permeate the linguistic and cultural system suffice.
* Whether conceptual systems are absolute or whether they can evolve.
* Whether the similarity criterion is translatability or the use of linguistic expressions.
* Whether the emphasis of linguistic relativity is language or the brain.
Lakoff concluded that many of Whorf&#x27;s critics had criticized him using novel definitions of linguistic relativity, rendering their criticisms moot.

== Refinements ==
Researchers such as Boroditsky, Choi, Majid, Lucy and Levinson believe that language influences thought in more limited ways than the broadest early claims. Researchers examine the interface between thought (or cognition), language and culture and describe the relevant influences. They use experimental data to back up their conclusions. Kay ultimately concluded that &quot;[the] Whorf hypothesis is supported in the right visual field but not the left&quot;. His findings show that accounting for brain lateralization offers another perspective.

=== Behavior-centered research ===
Recent studies have also used a &quot;behavior-based&quot; method, which starts by comparing behavior across linguistic groups and then searches for causes for that behavior in the linguistic system. In an early example of this method, Whorf attributed the occurrence of fires at a chemical plant to the workers&#x27; use of the word &#x27;empty&#x27; to describe barrels containing only explosive vapors.

More recently, Bloom noticed that speakers of Chinese had unexpected difficulties answering counterfactual questions posed to them in a questionnaire. He concluded that this was related to the way in which counter-factuality is marked grammatically in Chinese. Other researchers attributed this result to Bloom&#x27;s flawed translations. Strømnes examined why Finnish factories had a greater occurrence of work related accidents than similar Swedish ones. He concluded that cognitive differences between the grammatical usage of Swedish prepositions and Finnish cases could have caused Swedish factories to pay more attention to the work process while Finnish factory organizers paid more attention to the individual worker.

==== Numbers and classifiers ====
Everett&#x27;s work on the Pirahã language of the Brazilian Amazon found several peculiarities that he interpreted as corresponding to linguistically rare features, such as a lack of numbers and color terms in the way those are otherwise defined and the absence of certain types of clauses. Everett&#x27;s conclusions were met with skepticism from universalists who claimed that the linguistic deficit is explained by the lack of need for such concepts.

Recent research with non-linguistic experiments in languages with different grammatical properties (e.g., languages with and without numeral classifiers or with different gender grammar systems) showed that language differences in human categorization are due to such differences. Experimental research suggests that this linguistic influence on thought diminishes over time, as when speakers of one language are exposed to another.

==== Time perception ====
Research on time-space congruency suggests that temporal perception is shaped by spatial metaphors embedded in language. Casasanto &amp; Boroditsky (2008) found that people often use spatial metaphors to conceptualize time, linking longer distances with longer durations. Research has shown that linguistic differences can influence the perception of time. Swedish, like English, tends to describe time in terms of spatial distance (e.g., &quot;a long meeting&quot;), whereas Spanish often uses quantity-based metaphors (e.g., &quot;a big meeting&quot;). These linguistic patterns correlate with differences in how speakers estimate temporal durations: Swedish speakers are more influenced by spatial length, while Spanish speakers are more sensitive to volume.

Expanding on this, research on time-space congruency suggests that temporal perception is shaped by spatial metaphors embedded in language. In many languages, time is conceptualized along a horizontal axis (e.g., &quot;looking forward to the future&quot; in English). However, Mandarin speakers also employ vertical metaphors for time, referring to earlier events as &quot;up&quot; and later events as &quot;down&quot;. Experiments have shown that Mandarin speakers are quicker to recognize temporal sequences when they are presented vertically, whereas English speakers exhibit no such bias.

==== Pronoun-dropping and intentionality ====
Kashima &amp; Kashima observed a correlation between the perceived individualism or collectivism in the social norms of a given country, with the tendency to neglect the use of pronouns in the country&#x27;s language. They argued that explicit reference to &quot;you&quot; and &quot;I&quot; reinforces a distinction between the self and the other in the speaker.

Research also suggests that this structural difference influences how speakers attribute intentionality in events. Fausey &amp; Boroditsky (2010) conducted experiments comparing how English and Spanish speakers describe accidental versus intentional actions. Their results showed that English speakers, who are accustomed to using explicit pronouns, were more likely to specify the agent responsible for an accidental event (e.g., &quot;John broke the vase&quot;). In contrast, Spanish speakers, who frequently omit pronouns, were more likely to use agent-neutral descriptions for accidental events (e.g., &quot;The vase broke&quot;).

==== Future tense ====
A 2013 study found that those who speak &quot;futureless&quot; languages with no grammatical marking of the future tense save more, retire with more wealth, smoke less, practice safer sex, and are less obese than those who do not. This effect has come to be termed the linguistic-savings hypothesis and has been replicated in several cross-cultural and cross-country studies. However, a study of Chinese, which can be spoken both with and without the grammatical future marking &quot;will&quot;, found that subjects do not behave more impatiently when &quot;will&quot; is used repetitively. This laboratory-based finding of elective variation within a single language does not refute the linguistic savings hypothesis but some have suggested that it shows the effect may be due to culture or other non-linguistic factors.

=== Psycholinguistic research ===
Psycholinguistic studies explored motion perception, emotion perception, object representation and memory. The gold standard of psycholinguistic studies on linguistic relativity is now finding non-linguistic cognitive differences in speakers of different languages (thus rendering inapplicable Pinker&#x27;s criticism that linguistic relativity is &quot;circular&quot;).

Recent work with bilingual speakers attempts to distinguish the effects of language from those of culture on bilingual cognition including perceptions of time, space, motion, colors and emotion. Researchers described differences between bilinguals and monolinguals in perception of color, representations of timeand other elements of cognition.

== Other domains ==
Linguistic relativity inspired others to consider whether thought and emotion could be influenced by manipulating language.

=== Science and philosophy ===
The question bears on philosophical, psychological, linguistic and anthropological questions.

A major question is whether human psychological faculties are mostly innate or whether they are mostly a result of learning, and hence subject to cultural and social processes such as language. The innate opinion is that humans share the same set of basic faculties, variability due to cultural differences is less important, and the human mind is a mostly biological construction, so all humans who share the same neurological configuration can be expected to have similar cognitive patterns.

Multiple alternatives have advocates. The contrary constructivist position holds that human faculties and concepts are largely influenced by socially constructed and learned categories, without many biological restrictions. Another variant is idealist, which holds that human mental capacities are generally unrestricted by biological-material structures. Another is essentialist, which holds that essential differences may influence the ways individuals or groups experience and conceptualize the world. Yet another is relativist (cultural relativism), which sees different cultural groups as employing different conceptual schemes that are not necessarily compatible or commensurable, nor more or less in accord with external reality.

Another debate considers whether thought is a type of internal speech or is independent of and prior to language.

In the philosophy of language, the question addresses the relations between language, knowledge and the external world, and the concept of truth. Philosophers such as Putnam, Fodor, Davidson, and Dennett see language as directly representing entities from the objective world, and categorization as reflecting that world. Other philosophers (e.g. Quine, Searle, and Foucault) argue that categorization and conceptualization is subjective and arbitrary. Another view, represented by Jason Storm, seeks a third way by emphasizing how language changes and imperfectly represents reality without being completely divorced from ontology.

Another question is whether language is a tool for representing and referring to objects in the world, or whether it is a system used to construct mental representations that can be communicated.

=== Therapy and self-development ===
Sapir/Whorf contemporary Alfred Korzybski was independently developing his theory of general semantics, which was intended to use language&#x27;s influence of thinking to maximize human cognitive abilities. Korzybski&#x27;s thinking was influenced by logical philosophy such as Russell and Whitehead&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; and Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus&quot;. Although Korzybski was not aware of Sapir and Whorf&#x27;s writings, the philosophy was adopted by Whorf-admirer Stuart Chase, who fused Whorf&#x27;s interest in cultural-linguistic variation with Korzybski&#x27;s programme in his popular work &quot;The Tyranny of Words&quot;. S. I. Hayakawa was a follower and popularizer of Korzybski&#x27;s work, writing &quot;Language in Thought and Action&quot;. The general semantics philosophy influenced the development of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), another therapeutic technique that seeks to use awareness of language use to influence cognitive patterns.

Korzybski independently described a &quot;strong&quot; version of the hypothesis of linguistic relativity.

=== Artificial languages ===
In their fiction, authors such as Ayn Rand and George Orwell explored how linguistic relativity might be exploited for political purposes. In Rand&#x27;s &quot;Anthem&quot;, a fictive communist society removed the possibility of individualism by removing the word &quot;I&quot; from the language. In Orwell&#x27;s &quot;1984&quot; the authoritarian state created the language Newspeak to make it impossible for people to think critically about the government, or even to contemplate that they might be impoverished or oppressed, by reducing the number of words to reduce the thought of the locutor.

Others have been fascinated by the possibilities of creating new languages that could enable new, and perhaps better, ways of thinking. Examples of such languages designed to explore the human mind include Loglan, explicitly designed by James Cooke Brown to test the linguistic relativity hypothesis, by experimenting whether it would make its speakers think more logically. Suzette Haden Elgin, who was involved with the early development of neuro-linguistic programming, invented the language Láadan to explore linguistic relativity by making it easier to express what Elgin considered the female worldview, as opposed to Standard Average European languages, which she considered to convey a &quot;male centered&quot; worldview. John Quijada&#x27;s language Ithkuil was designed to explore the limits of the number of cognitive categories a language can keep its speakers aware of at once. Similarly, Sonja Lang&#x27;s Toki Pona was developed according to a Taoist philosophy for exploring how (or if) such a language would direct human thought.

=== Programming languages ===
APL programming language originator Kenneth E. Iverson believed that the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis applied to computer languages (without actually mentioning it by name). His Turing Award lecture, &quot;Notation as a Tool of Thought&quot;, was devoted to this theme, arguing that more powerful notations aided thinking about computer algorithms.

The essays of Paul Graham explore similar themes, such as a conceptual hierarchy of computer languages, with more expressive and succinct languages at the top. Thus, the so-called &quot;blub&quot; paradox (after a hypothetical programming language of average complexity called &quot;Blub&quot;) says that anyone preferentially using some particular programming language will &quot;know&quot; that it is more powerful than some, but not that it is less powerful than others. The reason is that &quot;writing&quot; in some language means &quot;thinking&quot; in that language. Hence the paradox, because typically programmers are &quot;satisfied with whatever language they happen to use, because it dictates the way they think about programs&quot;.

In a 2003 presentation at an open source convention, Yukihiro Matsumoto, creator of the programming language Ruby, said that one of his inspirations for developing the language was the science fiction novel &quot;Babel-17&quot;, based on the Whorf Hypothesis.

=== Science fiction ===
Numerous examples of linguistic relativity have appeared in science fiction.

* The totalitarian regime depicted in George Orwell&#x27;s 1949 novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty Four&quot; in effect acts on the basis of the Whorf hypothesis, seeking to replace English with &quot;Newspeak&quot;, a language constructed specifically with the intention that thoughts subversive of the regime cannot be expressed in it, and therefore people educated to speak and think in it would not have such thoughts.
* In his 1958 science fiction novel &quot;The Languages of Pao&quot; the author Jack Vance describes how specialized languages are a major part of a strategy to create specific classes in a society, to enable the population to withstand occupation and develop itself.
* In Samuel R. Delany&#x27;s 1966 science fiction novel &quot;Babel-17&quot;, the author describes an advanced, information-dense language that can be used as a weapon. Learning it turns one into an unwilling traitor as it alters perception and thought.
* Ted Chiang&#x27;s 1998 short story &quot;Story of Your Life&quot; developed the concept of the Whorf hypothesis as applied to an alien species that visits Earth. The aliens&#x27; biology contributes to their spoken and written languages, which are distinct. In the 2016 American movie &quot;Arrival&quot;, based on Chiang&#x27;s short story, the Whorf hypothesis is the premise. The protagonist explains that &quot;the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis is the theory that the language you speak determines how you think&quot;.
* Gene Wolfe&#x27;s four volume science fiction novel &quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot; describes the North American &quot;Ascian&quot; people as speaking a language composed entirely of quotations that have been approved by a small ruling class.

=== Sociolinguistics and linguistic relativity ===
Sociolinguistics affects some variables within language, including the manner in which words are pronounced, word selection in certain dialogue, context, and tone. It&#x27;s suggested that these effects may have implications for linguistic relativity.

<text>A statute of limitations, known in civil law systems as a prescriptive period, is a law passed by a legislative body to set the maximum time after an event within which legal proceedings may be initiated. In most jurisdictions, such periods exist for both criminal law and civil law such as contract law and property law, though often under different names and with varying details.

When the time which is specified in a statute of limitations runs out, a claim might no longer be filed or, if it is filed, it may be subject to dismissal if the defense against that claim is raised that the claim is time-barred as having been filed after the statutory limitations period.

When a statute of limitations expires in a criminal case, the courts no longer have jurisdiction. In many jurisdictions with statutes of limitation there is no time limit for dealing with particularly serious crimes.

In civil law systems, such provisions are typically part of their civil and criminal codes. The cause of action dictates the statute of limitations, which can be reduced or extended in order to ensure a full and fair trial. The intention of these laws is to facilitate resolution within a &quot;reasonable&quot; period of time. What amount of time is considered &quot;reasonable&quot; varies from country to country. In some countries, as in the US, it may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and state (or province, etc.) to state. Internationally, the statute of limitations may vary from one civil or criminal action to another. Some countries do not have a statute of limitations.

Analysis of a statute of limitations also requires the examination of any associated statute of repose, tolling provisions, and exclusions.

==Applications==
Common law legal systems can include a statute specifying the length of time within which a claimant or prosecutor must file a case. In some jurisdictions (e.g., California), a case cannot begin after the period specified, and courts have no jurisdiction over cases filed after the statute of limitations has expired. In some other jurisdictions (e.g., New South Wales, Australia), a claim can be filed which may prove to have been brought outside the limitations period, but the court will retain jurisdiction in order to determine that issue, and the onus is on the defendant to plead it as part of their defense, or else the claim will not be statute barred.

Once they are filed, cases do not need to be resolved within the period specified in the statute of limitations.

==Purpose==
The purpose and effect of statutes of limitations are to protect defendants. There are three reasons for their enactment:
* A plaintiff with a valid cause of action can pursue it with reasonable diligence.
* By the time a stale claim is litigated, a defendant might have lost evidence necessary to disprove the claim.
* Litigation of a long-dormant claim may result in more cruelty than justice.

In Classical Athens, a five-year statute of limitations was established for almost all cases, exceptions being such as the prosecution of non-constitutional laws (which had no limitation). Demosthenes wrote that these statutes of limitations were adopted to control &quot;sycophants&quot; (professional accusers).

The limitation period generally begins when the plaintiff&#x27;s cause of action accrues, meaning the date upon which the plaintiff is first able to maintain the cause of action in court, or when the plaintiff first becomes aware of a previous injury (for example, occupational lung diseases such as asbestosis).

==Statute of repose==

A statute of repose limits the time within which an action may be brought based upon when a particular event occurred (such as the completion of construction of a building or the date of purchase of manufactured goods), and does not permit extensions. A statute of limitations is similar to a statute of repose but may be extended for a variety of reasons (such as the minority of the victim).

For example, most U.S. jurisdictions have passed statutes of repose for construction defects. If a person receives an electric shock due to a wiring defect that resulted from the builder&#x27;s negligence during construction of a building, the builder is potentially liable for damages if the suit is brought within the time period defined by the statute, normally starting with the date that construction is substantially completed. After the statutory time period has passed, without regard to the nature or degree of the builder&#x27;s negligence or misconduct, the statute of repose presents an absolute defense to the claim.

Statutes of repose are sometimes controversial; manufacturers contend that they are necessary to avoid unfair litigation and encourage consumers to maintain their property. Alternatively, consumer advocates argue that they reduce incentives to manufacture durable products and disproportionately affect the poor, because manufacturers will have less incentive to ensure low-cost or &quot;bargain&quot; products are manufactured to exacting safety standards.

==Tolling and the discovery rule==
Many jurisdictions toll or suspend the limitation period in exceptional circumstances such as if the aggrieved person (plaintiff, appellant or petitioner) was a minor, or has filed a bankruptcy proceeding. In those instances, the running of limitations is tolled or paused, until the condition ends. Equitable tolling may also be applied if an individual may intimidate a moving party into not reporting or has been promised a suspended period.

The statute of limitations may begin when the harmful event, such as fraud or injury, occurs or it may begin when the harmful event is discovered. The U.S. Supreme Court has described the &quot;standard rule&quot; of when the time begins as &quot;when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.&quot; The rule has existed since the 1830s. A &quot;discovery rule&quot; applies in other cases (including medical malpractice), or a similar effect may be applied by tolling.

According to U.S. district judge Sean J. McLaughlin, the discovery rule does not apply to mass media such as newspapers and the Internet; the statute of limitations begins to run at the date of publication. In 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in &quot;Gabelli v. SEC&quot; that the discovery rule does not apply to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#x27;s investment-advisor-fraud lawsuits since one of the purposes of the agency is to root out fraud.

In private civil matters, the limitation period may generally be shortened or lengthened by agreement of the parties. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, the parties to a contract for sale of goods may reduce the limitation period to one year but not extend it.

Limitation periods that are known as laches may apply in situations of equity; a judge will not issue an injunction if the requesting party waited too long to ask for it. Such periods are subject to broad judicial discretion.

For US military cases, the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) states that all charges except those facing court-martial on a capital charge have a five-year statute of limitations. If the charges are dropped in all UCMJ proceedings except those headed for general court-martial, they may be reinstated, once only, for six months.

==Prescription==
In civil law countries, almost all lawsuits must be brought within a legally-determined period at the end of which the right of action is extinguished. This is known as liberative or extinctive prescription. Under Italian and Romanian law, criminal trials must be ended within a time limit.

In criminal cases, the public prosecutor must lay charges within a time limit which varies by jurisdiction and varies based on the nature of the charge, whose directives vary from country to country. Over the last decade of the 20th century, many United States jurisdictions significantly lengthened the statute of limitations for sex offenses, particularly against children, as a response to research and popular belief that a variety of causes can delay the recognition and reporting of crimes of this nature.

Common triggers for suspending the prescription include a defendant&#x27;s fugitive status or the commission of a new crime. In some jurisdictions, a criminal may be convicted &quot;in absentia&quot;. Prescription should not be confused with the need to prosecute within &quot;a reasonable delay&quot; as obligated by the European Court of Human Rights.

==Laws by region==

===International crimes===
Under international law, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are usually not subject to the statute of limitations as codified in a number of multilateral treaties. States ratifying the Convention on the Non-Applicability of Statutory Limitations to War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity agree to disallow limitations claims for these crimes. According to Article 29 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes &quot;shall not be subject to any statute of limitations&quot;.

===Australia===
In Australia, there are no statutes of limitation in criminal proceedings if the maximum penalty that can be imposed for an offence committed by an individual includes imprisonment for more than 6 months. For civil matters, the statutes of limitation are prescribed by each state or territory jurisdiction.

====Victoria====
The Limitations Act of 1958 allows 12 years for victims of child abuse to make a claim, with age 37 the latest at which a claim can be made. The police submitted evidence to a commission, the Victorian Inquiry into Church and Institutional Child Abuse (in existence since 2012) indicating that it takes an average of 24 years for a victims of child sexual abuse to go to the police. According to Attorney General Robert Clark, the government will remove statutes of limitations on criminal child abuse; victims of violent crime should be given additional time, as adults, to deal with the legal system. Offenders of minors and the disabled have used the statute of limitations to avoid detection and prosecution, moving from state to state and country to country; an example which was presented to the Victorian Inquiry was the Christian Brothers.

An argument for abolishing statutes of limitations for civil claims by minors and people under guardianship is ensuring that abuse of vulnerable people would be acknowledged by lawyers, police, organizations and governments, with enforceable penalties for organisations which have turned a blind eye in the past. Support groups such as SNAP Australia, Care Leavers Australia Network and Broken Rites have submitted evidence to the Victoria inquiry, and the Law Institute of Victoria has advocated changes to the statute of limitations.

====Western Australia====
The Criminal Procedure Act 2004 outlines the statute of limitations, stating that a simple offense (an offence which can only be brought to a magistrate&#x27;s court, and cannot include more than 12 months&#x27; imprisonment as the maximum penalty) shall have a statute of limitations of 12 months. However, all crimes (offences which can be brought to a district court or the supreme court) have no statute of limitations. Furthermore, a person may be charged with a simple offence after 12 months&#x27; if the person consents to such a charge being laid, or if that offence has a different statute of limitations as provided by law.

===Canada===
Summary conviction offences have a limitation period of 12 months.

Indictable (serious) offences such as fraud, serious theft, murder, kidnapping, arson, bribery, perjury, do not have a limitation period. A defendant can be charged at any future date. In sexual abuse cases in particular, men and women have been charged and convicted more than 40 years after the abuse had been committed.

Civil law limitations vary by province. In Ontario, this is governed by the &quot;Limitations Act, 2002&quot;.

===Finland===
In Finland, the authority of a prosecuting official to bring charges for a crime expires after a set period of time has passed since the act. This period is 20, 10, 5, or 2, years depending on the seriousness of the offence. Offences punishable with life imprisonment, such as murder and treason, do not expire. Sexual offences committed against minors do not expire before the victim reaches 23 or 28 years of age, depending on the nature of the offence.

===Germany===
In Germany, the statute of limitations on crimes varies by type of crime, with the highest statute of limitation being 30 years for voluntary manslaughter (). Murder, genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression have no statute of limitations.

In Germany, the crime of murder used to have a 20-year statute of limitations. In 1969, the statute of limitations for murder was extended from 20 to 30 years. The limitations were abolished altogether in 1979, in order to prevent Nazi criminals from avoiding criminal liability.

For most other criminal offences, the statute of limitations is set by Section 78(3) of the Criminal Code () as follows:
* 30 years for offences which are punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment for life;
* 20 years for offences which are punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of over 10 years but not by imprisonment for life;
* 10 years for offences which are punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of over 5 years but no more than 10 years;
* 5 years for offences which are punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of over 1 year but no more than 5 years;
* 3 years for all other offences.

In the civil code (), the regular statute of limitations is three years (plus the time until the end of the calendar year); however, different terms between two and thirty years may apply in specific situations. For example, the term is only two years for claims for alleged defects of purchased goods, but 30 years for claims resulting from a court judgement (such as awarded damages).

===India===
The statute of limitations in India is defined by the Limitations Act, 1963.

The statute of limitations for criminal offences is governed by Sec. 468 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

===Indonesia===
The statutes of limitations in Indonesia are defined by articles 136-139 of Law No. 1 of 2023 on Criminal Code, and varies by type of crimes and ages of the perpetrators. According to article 136 of the Criminal Code, as well as article 7 and article 46 of Law No. 26 of 2000 on Human Rights Courts, the limits are as follows:
* For crimes committed by adults:
** 3 years for crimes which are punishable by a maximum of 1 year imprisonment and/or by only a maximum criminal fine of category III (Rp50,000,000).
** 6 years for crimes which are punishable by a maximum of 3 years imprisonment.
** 12 years for crimes which are punishable by a maximum of 7 years imprisonment.
** 18 years for crimes which are punishable by a maximum of 15 years imprisonment.
** 20 years for crimes which are punishable by a maximum of 20 years imprisonment, life imprisonment, or capital punishment.
* For crimes committed by children:
** 1 year for crimes which are punishable by a maximum of 1 year imprisonment and/or by only a maximum criminal fine of category III (Rp50,000,000).
** 2 years for crimes which are punishable by a maximum of 3 years imprisonment.
** 4 years for crimes which are punishable by a maximum of 7 years imprisonment.
** 6 years for crimes which are punishable by a maximum of 15 years imprisonment.
** around 6.6 years for crimes which are punishable by a maximum of 20 years imprisonment, life imprisonment, or capital punishment.
* No limit for genocide and crimes against humanity.

For most crimes, the prescriptive period begins from the following day after the crime is committed. However, exceptions are made for crimes of forgery, currency destruction, abduction, and hostage-taking. For the first two, the period is calculated from the following day after the forged goods or damaged currency is used, while for crimes of abduction and hostage-taking, it is calculated from the following day after the victim is released or dies as a direct result of the crime.

===Ireland===
=== New Zealand ===
The statutes of limitations in New Zealand are defined by section 25 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2011. For offences committed by body corporates, the statutes of limitation are determined as if they were a natural person. The limits are as follows:
* 6 months for offences which are punishable by a maximum of 3 months imprisonment or a $7,500 fine.
* 12 months for offences which are punishable by a maximum of 6 months imprisonment or a $20,000 fine.
* 5 years for offences which are punishable by a maximum of 3 years imprisonment, although this can be extended with the consent of the Solicitor-General.
* No limit for offences which are punishable by more than 3 years imprisonment.

===Norway===
The statute of limitations on murder was abolished by a change in law on 1 July 2014, causing any murders committed after 1 July 1989 to have no statute of limitations. This led to the national police force implementing a new investigation group for old cases called the &quot;Cold Case&quot; group. The law was also changed to let cases involving domestic violence, forced marriage, human trafficking and genital mutilation to count from the day the defendant turns 18 years old. Cases where the statute of limitations has already passed can not be extended due to the constitution preventing it.

=== Philippines ===
In the Philippines, the Revised Penal Code has different limitation periods, based on the penalty of the crime:
* &quot;Reclusión perpetua&quot; or &quot;reclusión temporal&quot; (imprisonment of 12 years and 1 day to 40 years): 20 years
* Other afflictive penalties (imprisonment of 6 years and 1 day to 12 years): 15 years
* Correctional penalties: 10 years, except:
** &quot;Arresto mayor&quot; (imprisonment of 1 month and 1 day to 6 months): 5 years
** Libel and other similar offenses: 1 year
** Oral defamation and slander: 6 months
* Light penalties (imprisonment of 1 day to 30 days): 2 months

Other special laws have their own limitation periods. For crimes punished under the Revised Penal Code, the limitation period won&#x27;t run if the offender is outside the Philippines, while for those punished under other laws, it does. Municipal ordinances have a limitation period of 2 months.

===South Korea===
In July 2015, the National Assembly abolished a 25-year limit on first degree murder; it had previously been extended from 15 to 25 years in December 2007.

=== Turkey ===

Turkish Code of Obligations sets the general limitation period to ten years, which applies where the law does not provide a specific limitation period.

There is no statute of limitations for sexual offenses committed against minors, however, under both the Turkish Penal Code (article 99) and Turkish Civil Code (Law No. 2827).

===United Kingdom===
The United Kingdom has no statute of limitations for criminal offences beyond minor summary offences (offences tried exclusively in the magistrates&#x27; courts); the Magistrates&#x27; Courts Act 1980 requires that criminal proceedings for summary offences be brought within six months. To obtain a conviction in &quot;some road traffic offences&quot; (e.g. speeding), the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 requires that the driver must be notified within 14 days of the offence of the intention to prosecute.

For civil claims, the period of validity varies depending on the type of claim. For example, a claim (debt) from a simple contract can no longer be pursued after six years.

===United States===
In the United States, statutes of limitations may apply in criminal procedures and civil lawsuits. Statutes of limitations vary significantly among U.S. jurisdictions.

A government agency is permitted by the Congress to create under federal regulations its own statute of limitations.

====Retroactive extensions====
The U.S. Supreme Court held in 2003 in &quot;Stogner v. California&quot; by a 5–4 majority that California&#x27;s retroactive extension of the criminal statute of limitations for sexual offenses committed against minors was an unconstitutional ex post facto law.

====Civil statutes====
A civil statute of limitations applies to a non-criminal legal action, including a tort or contract case. If the statute of limitations expires before a lawsuit is filed, the defendant may raise the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense to seek dismissal of the claim. The exact time period depends on both the state and the type of claim (contract claim, personal injury, fraud etc.). Most fall in the range of one to ten years, with two to three years being most common.

====Criminal statutes====
A criminal statute of limitations defines a time period during which charges must be initiated for a criminal offense. If a charge is filed after the statute of limitations expires, the defendant may obtain dismissal of the charge.

=====Initiation of charges=====
The statute of limitations in a criminal case only runs until a criminal charge is filed and a warrant issued, even if the defendant is a fugitive. When the identity of a defendant is not known, some jurisdictions provide mechanisms to initiate charges and thus stop the statute of limitations from running. For example, some states allow an indictment of a John Doe defendant based upon a DNA profile derived from evidence obtained through a criminal investigation. Although rare, a grand jury can issue an indictment in absentia for high-profile crimes to get around an upcoming statute of limitations deadline. One example is the skyjacking of Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 305 by D. B. Cooper in 1971. The identity of D. B. Cooper remains unknown, and he was indicted under the name &quot;John Doe, aka Dan Cooper.&quot;

=====Heinous crimes=====
Crimes which are widely considered heinous have no statute of limitations. Although there is usually no statute of limitations for murder (particularly first-degree murder), judges have been known to dismiss murder charges in cold cases if they feel that the delay violates the defendant&#x27;s right to a speedy trial. For example, waiting many years for an alibi witness to die before commencing a murder trial would be unconstitutional.

=====Military law=====
Under the U.S. Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), desertion has no statute of limitations.

Maritime Injury Law

Under 46 U.S. Code § 30106, &quot;Except as otherwise provided by law, a civil action for damages for personal injury or death arising out of a maritime tort must be brought within 3 years after the cause of action arose.&quot; There are some exceptions to this, primarily with regard to Jones Act cases filed against the government, in which case the statute of limitations can be less than 2 years.

=====State laws=====

====Exceptions====
U.S. jurisdictions recognize exceptions to statutes of limitation that may allow for the prosecution of a crime or civil lawsuit even after the statute of limitations would otherwise have expired. Some states stop the clock for a suspect who is not residing within the state or is purposely hiding. Kentucky, North Carolina, and South Carolina have no statutes of limitation for felonies, while Wyoming includes misdemeanors as well. However, the right to speedy trial may derail any prosecution after many years have passed.

=====Fraud on the court=====

When an officer of the court is found to have fraudulently presented facts to impair the court&#x27;s impartial performance of its legal task, the act (known as &quot;fraud upon the court&quot;) is not subject to a statute of limitation: &quot;This concept that the inherent power of federal courts to vacate a fraudulently obtained judgment—even years after the judgment was entered—has long been recognized by the Supreme Court.&quot; Fraud on the court can be done many ways and in any court. One of which can be &quot;where the court or a member is corrupted or influenced or influence is attempted or where the judge has not performed his judicial function — thus where the impartial functions of the court have been directly corrupted.&quot; Officer of the court includes any judge, law clerk, court clerk, lawyer, investigator, probation officer, referee, legal guardian, parenting-time expeditor, mediator, evaluator, administrator, special appointee, and/or anyone else whose influence is part of the judicial mechanism.

=====Continuing-violations doctrine=====
In tort law, if any person or entity commits a series of illegal acts against another person or entity (or in criminal law if a defendant commits a continuing crime) the limitation period may begin to run from the last act in the series. The entire chain of events can be tolled if the violations were continuing. Courts have explained that the continuing-violations doctrine &quot;tolls the statute of limitations in situations where a continuing pattern forms due to discriminatory acts which have been occurring over a period of time, as long as at least one incident of discrimination occurred within the limitations period.&quot; Whether the continuing-violations doctrine applies to a particular violation is subject to judicial discretion; it was said to apply to copyright infringement in the jurisdiction of the Seventh Circuit, but not in the jurisdiction of the Second Circuit.

<text>A submarine sandwich, commonly known as a sub, hoagie (Philadelphia metropolitan area and Western Pennsylvania English), hero (New York City English), Italian (Maine English), grinder (New England English, Fulton County, NY), wedge (Westchester, NY), or a spuckie (Boston English) is a type of American cold or hot sandwich made from a cylindrical bread roll split lengthwise and filled with meats, cheeses, vegetables, and condiments.

The terms &quot;&quot; and &quot;sub&quot; are widespread in the US and not assignable to any certain part, although many of the localized terms are clustered in the northeastern United States.

==History and etymology==
The Italian sandwich originated in several different Italian-American communities in the northeastern United States from the late 19th to mid-20th centuries. The popularity of the Italian-American sandwich grew from its origins in Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island extending to most of the United States and Canada. With the advent of chain restaurants, it is available in much of the world. Sociologists Edwin Eames and Howard Robboy identified thirteen different terms for the submarine sandwich in the United States.

===Submarine===
The use of the term &quot;submarine&quot; or &quot;sub&quot; (after the resemblance of the roll to the shape of a submarine) is widespread in the United States and Canada. Some accounts source the name as originating in New London, Connecticut (site of a United States Navy submarine base from 1915 onwards) in the World War II era. Written advertisements from 1940 in Wilmington, Delaware indicate the term originated prior to the United States entering World War II.

One theory says the submarine was brought to the U.S. by Dominic Conti (1874–1954), an Italian immigrant who came to New York in the late-19th century. He supposedly named it after seeing the recovered 1901 submarine called &quot;Fenian Ram&quot; in the Paterson Museum of New Jersey in 1928. His granddaughter said:

====Party sub====
A party sub is a particularly long submarine sandwich, usually cut into pieces and served to guests at parties.
===Hoagie===

The term &quot;hoagie&quot; originated in the Philadelphia area. In 1953, the &quot;Philadelphia Bulletin&quot; reported that Italian-Americans working at the World War I–era shipyard known as Hog Island, where emergency shipping was produced for the war effort, introduced the sandwich by putting various meats, cheeses, and lettuce between two slices of bread. This became known as the &quot;Hog Island&quot; sandwich; shortened to &quot;Hoggies&quot;, then the &quot;hoagie&quot;. Dictionary.com offers the following origin of the term &quot;hoagie -&quot; n. American English (originally Philadelphia) word for &quot;hero, large sandwich made from a long, split roll&quot;; originally &quot;hoggie&quot; (c. 1936), traditionally said to be named for the jazz musician Hoagy Carmichael (1899–1981), but the use of the word predates his celebrity and the original spelling seems to suggest another source (perhaps &quot;hog&quot;). The modern spelling dates from about 1945; it may have been altered by influence of Carmichael&#x27;s nickname.

The &quot;Philadelphia Almanac and Citizen&#x27;s Manual&quot; offers a different explanation saying the sandwich was created by early-twentieth-century street vendors called &quot;hokey-pokey men&quot;, who sold antipasto salad, meats, cookies, and buns with a cut in them. When Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s operetta &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; opened in Philadelphia in 1879, bakeries produced a long loaf called the pinafore. Entrepreneurial &quot;hokey-pokey men&quot; sliced the loaf in half, stuffed it with antipasto salad, and sold the world&#x27;s first &quot;hoagie&quot;. Another explanation is that the word &quot;hoagie&quot; arose in the late 19th to early 20th centuries, among the Italian community in South Philadelphia; at the time &quot;on the hoke&quot; meant that someone was destitute. Deli owners gave away scraps of cheeses and meats in an Italian bread-roll known as a &quot;hokie&quot;, but Italian immigrants pronounced it &quot;hoagie&quot;. Yet another possible origin of the term, as conveyed by Howard Robboy is that a man in Philadelphia, Alphonso DePalma, who later opened a sandwich shop there claimed to have said in 1928, &quot;You have to be a hog to eat one of those.&quot; Shortly after World War II, there were numerous varieties of the term in use throughout Philadelphia. By the 1940s, the spelling &quot;hoagie&quot; dominated less-used variations like &quot;hoogie&quot; and &quot;hoggie&quot;. By 1955, restaurants throughout the area were using the term &quot;hoagie&quot;. Listings in Pittsburgh show hoagies arriving in 1961 and becoming widespread in that city by 1966.

Former Philadelphia mayor (and later Pennsylvania governor) Ed Rendell declared the hoagie to be the &quot;Official Sandwich of Philadelphia&quot;. However, there are claims that the hoagie was actually a product of nearby Chester, Pennsylvania. DiCostanza&#x27;s in Boothwyn, Pennsylvania claims that the mother of DiConstanza&#x27;s owner originated the hoagie in 1925 in Chester. DiCostanza relates the story that a customer came into the family deli and through an exchange matching the customer&#x27;s requests and the deli&#x27;s offerings, the hoagie was created. Additional spellings include “hoagy”.

Woolworth&#x27;s to-go sandwich was called a &quot;hoagie&quot; in all of its U.S. stores. Bánh mì sandwiches are sometimes referred to as &quot;Vietnamese hoagies&quot; in Philadelphia.

===Hero===

The New York term &quot;hero&quot; is first attested in 1937. The name is sometimes credited to the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; food writer Clementine Paddleford in the 1930s, but there is no good evidence for the claim. It is also sometimes said that it is related to the &quot;gyro;&quot; that is unlikely as the &quot;gyro&quot; was unknown in the United States until the 1960s. &quot;Hero&quot; (plural usually &quot;&quot; not &quot;heroes&quot;) remains the prevailing New York City term for most sandwiches on an oblong roll with a generally Italian flavor, in addition to the original described above. Pizzeria menus often include eggplant parmigiana, chicken parmigiana, and meatball , each served with sauce.

===Grinder===

A common term in New England, especially Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island is &quot;grinder;&quot; its origin has several possibilities. One theory says it is derived from Italian-American slang for a dock worker, among whom the sandwich was popular. Others say that it was called a grinder because the bread&#x27;s hard crust required much chewing. In Pennsylvania, New York, and parts of New England, the term &quot;grinder&quot; usually refers to a &quot;hot&quot; submarine sandwich (meatball, sausage, etc.), whereas a cold sandwich (e.g., cold cuts) is usually called a &quot;sub&quot;. In the Philadelphia area, the term &quot;grinder&quot; is also applied to any hoagie that is toasted in the oven after assembly, whether or not it is made with traditionally hot ingredients.

=== Italian ===
The term &quot;Maine Italian&quot; or simply &quot;Italian&quot; is used in Maine. Local folklore claims that a baker named Giovanni Amato invented the Italian in 1899.
The traditional Maine Italian sandwich is prepared using a long, soft bread roll or bun with ham and bologna along with American cheese, tomato, onion, green bell pepper, Greek olives, pickles, olive oil or salad oil, salt and cracked black pepper. Additional ingredients, such as pepperoni, banana pepper, or lettuce may be added to the sandwich. The sandwich is often cut in half to make it easier to handle.

===Wedge===
The term &quot;wedge&quot; is used in the New York counties of Dutchess, Putnam, and Westchester, as well as the Connecticut county of Fairfield–four counties directly north of New York City. Some base the name &quot;wedge&quot; on a diagonal cut in the middle of the sandwich, creating two halves or &quot;wedges&quot;, or a &quot;wedge&quot; cut out of the top half of the bread with the fillings &quot;wedged&quot; in between, or a sandwich that is served between two &quot;wedges&quot; of bread. It has been said that &quot;wedge&quot; is short for &quot;sandwich&quot;, with the name having originated from an Italian deli owner located in Yonkers, who got tired of saying the whole word.
&quot;Wedge&quot; or &quot;wedgie&quot; can also refer to a northeastern deli meat sandwich cooked on pizza dough or a style of club sandwich.

===Spukie===
The term &quot;spukie&quot; (&quot;spukkie&quot; or &quot;spuckie&quot;) is unique to the city of Boston and derives from the Italian word &quot;spuccadella&quot;, meaning &quot;long roll&quot;. The word &quot;spuccadella&quot; is not typically found in Italian dictionaries, which may suggest that it could be a regional Italian dialect, or possibly a Boston Italian-American innovation. Spukie is typically heard in parts of Dorchester and South Boston. Some bakeries in Boston&#x27;s North End neighborhood have homemade spuccadellas for sale.

==Popularity and availability==
In the United States, from its origins with the Italian-American labor force in the northeast, the sub began to show up on menus of local pizzerias. As time went on and its popularity grew, small restaurants, called hoagie shops and sub shops which specialized offering the sandwich began to open.

Subs or their national equivalents were already popular in many European, Asian, and Australasian countries when late 20th-century franchisee chain restaurants such as Subway and fast food outlets made them even more popular and increased the prevalence of the word &quot;sub&quot;. Many outlets offer non-traditional ingredient combinations. In the United States, there are many chain restaurants that specialize in subs. Major international chains include Firehouse Subs, Quiznos, Mr. Sub, Jersey Mike&#x27;s, Jimmy John&#x27;s, Potbelly Sandwich Shop, and the largest restaurant chain in the world, Subway. The sandwich is also often available at supermarkets, local delis, and convenience stores. They include Wawa, which annually runs a sub promotional event during the summer called Hoagiefest, and Publix, whose sandwiches are often referred to as &quot;pub subs&quot;.

<text>The Semitic languages are a branch of the Afroasiatic language family. They include Arabic, 
Amharic, Tigrinya, Aramaic, Hebrew, Maltese and numerous other ancient and modern languages. They are spoken by more than 330 million people across much of West Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Malta, and in large immigrant and expatriate communities in North America, Europe, and Australasia. The terminology was first used in the 1780s by members of the Göttingen school of history, who derived the name from Shem, one of the three sons of Noah in the Book of Genesis.

Semitic languages occur in written form from a very early historical date in West Asia, with East Semitic Akkadian (also known as Assyrian and Babylonian) and Eblaite texts (written in a script adapted from Sumerian cuneiform) appearing from in Mesopotamia and the northeastern Levant respectively. The only earlier attested languages are Sumerian and Elamite (2800 BCE to 550 BCE), both language isolates, and Egyptian (), a sister branch within the Afroasiatic family, related to the Semitic languages but not part of them. Amorite appeared in Mesopotamia and the northern Levant , followed by the mutually intelligible Canaanite languages (including Hebrew, Phoenician, Moabite, Edomite, and Ammonite, and perhaps Ekronite, Amalekite and Sutean), the still spoken Aramaic, and Ugaritic during the 2nd millennium BC.

Most scripts used to write Semitic languages are abjadsa type of alphabetic script that omits some or all of the vowels, which is feasible for these languages because the consonants are the primary carriers of meaning in the Semitic languages. These include the Ugaritic, Phoenician, Aramaic, Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, and ancient South Arabian alphabets. The Geʽez script, used for writing the Semitic languages of Ethiopia and Eritrea, is technically an abugida a modified abjad in which vowels are notated using diacritic marks added to the consonants at all times, in contrast with other Semitic languages which indicate vowels based on need or for introductory purposes. Maltese is the only Semitic language written in the Latin script and the only Semitic language to be an official language of the European Union.

The Semitic languages are notable for their nonconcatenative morphology. That is, word roots are not themselves syllables or words, but instead are isolated sets of consonants (usually three, making a so-called &quot;triliteral root&quot;). Words are composed from roots not so much by adding prefixes or suffixes, but rather by filling in the vowels between the root consonants, although prefixes and suffixes are often added as well. For example, in Arabic, the root meaning &quot;write&quot; has the form &quot;k-t-b&quot;. From this root, words are formed by filling in the vowels and sometimes adding consonants, e.g. كِتاب kitāb &quot;book&quot;, كُتُب kutub &quot;books&quot;, كاتِب kātib &quot;writer&quot;, كُتّاب kuttāb &quot;writers&quot;, كَتَب &quot;kataba&quot; &quot;he wrote&quot;, يكتُب &quot;yaktubu&quot; &quot;he writes&quot;, etc..

==Name and identification==

The similarity of the Hebrew, Arabic and Aramaic languages has been accepted by all scholars since medieval times. The languages were familiar to Western European scholars due to historical contact with neighbouring Near Eastern countries and through Biblical studies, and a comparative analysis of Hebrew, Arabic, and Aramaic was published in Latin in 1538 by Guillaume Postel. Almost two centuries later, Hiob Ludolf described the similarities between these three languages and the Ethiopian Semitic languages. However, neither scholar named this grouping as &quot;Semitic&quot;.

The term &quot;Semitic&quot; was created by members of the Göttingen school of history, initially by August Ludwig von Schlözer (1781), to designate the languages closely related to Arabic, Aramaic, and Hebrew. The choice of name was derived from Shem, one of the three sons of Noah in the genealogical accounts of the biblical Book of Genesis, or more precisely from the Koine Greek rendering of the name, . Johann Gottfried Eichhorn is credited with popularising the term, particularly via a 1795 article &quot;Semitische Sprachen&quot; (&quot;Semitic languages&quot;) in which he justified the terminology against criticism that Hebrew and Canaanite were the same language despite Canaan being &quot;Hamitic&quot; in the Table of Nations:
Previously these languages had been commonly known as the &quot;&quot; in European literature. In the 19th century, &quot;Semitic&quot; became the conventional name; however, an alternative name, &quot;&quot;, was later introduced by James Cowles Prichard and used by some writers.

==History==
===Ancient Semitic-speaking peoples===
Semitic languages were spoken and written across much of the Middle East and Asia Minor during the Bronze Age and Iron Age, the earliest attested being the East Semitic Akkadian of Mesopotamia (Akkad, Assyria, Isin, Larsa, and Babylonia) from the third millennium BC.

The origin of Semitic-speaking peoples is still under discussion. Several locations were proposed as possible sites of a prehistoric origin of Semitic-speaking peoples: Mesopotamia, the Levant, Ethiopia, the Eastern Mediterranean region, the Arabian Peninsula, and North Africa. According to a 2009 study, the Semitic languages originated in the Levant , and were introduced to the Horn of Africa c. 800 BC from the southern Arabian Peninsula, and to North Africa via Phoenician colonists at approximately the same time. Others assign the arrival of Semitic speakers in the Horn of Africa to a much earlier date. According to another hypothesis, Semitic originated from an offshoot of a still earlier language in North Africa; desertification led to emigration in the fourth millennium BC to both what is now Ethiopia and northeast out of Africa into West Asia.

The various extremely closely related and mutually intelligible Canaanite languages, a branch of the Northwest Semitic languages included Edomite, Hebrew, Ammonite, Moabite, Phoenician (Punic/Carthaginian), Samaritan Hebrew, and Ekronite. They were spoken in what is today Israel and the Palestinian territories, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, the northern Sinai Peninsula, some northern and eastern parts of the Arabian Peninsula, southwest fringes of Turkey, and in the case of Phoenician, coastal regions of Tunisia (Carthage), Libya, Algeria, and parts of Morocco, Spain, and possibly in Malta and other Mediterranean islands. Ugaritic, a Northwest Semitic language closely related to but distinct from the Canaanite group was spoken in the kingdom of Ugarit in north western Syria.

A hybrid Canaano-Akkadian language also emerged in Canaan (Israel and the Palestinian territories, Jordan, Lebanon) during the 14th century BC, incorporating elements of the Mesopotamian East Semitic Akkadian language of Assyria and Babylonia with the West Semitic Canaanite languages.

Aramaic, a still living ancient Northwest Semitic language, first attested in the 12th century BC in the northern Levant, gradually replaced the East Semitic and Canaanite languages across much of the Near East, particularly after being adopted as the lingua franca of the vast Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–605 BC) by Tiglath-Pileser III during the 8th century BC, and being retained by the succeeding Neo-Babylonian and Achaemenid Empires.

The &quot;Chaldean language&quot; (not to be confused with Aramaic or its Biblical variant, sometimes referred to as &quot;Chaldean&quot;) was a Northwest Semitic language, possibly closely related to Aramaic, but no examples of the language remain, as after settling in south eastern Mesopotamia from the Levant during the 9th century BC, the Chaldeans appear to have rapidly adopted the Akkadian and Aramaic languages of the indigenous Mesopotamians.

Old South Arabian languages (classified as South Semitic and therefore distinct from the Central-Semitic Arabic) were spoken in the kingdoms of Dilmun, Sheba, Ubar, Socotra, and Magan, which in modern terms encompassed part of the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, and Yemen. South Semitic languages are thought to have spread to the Horn of Africa circa 8th century BC where the Geʽez language emerged (though the direction of influence remains uncertain).

=== First century to twentieth century CE ===

Classical Syriac, a 200 CE Eastern Middle Aramaic dialect, used as a liturgical language in Mesopotamia, the Levant, and Kerala, India, rose to importance as a literary language of early Christianity in the third to fifth centuries and continued into the early Islamic era.

The Arabic language, although originating in the Arabian Peninsula, first emerged in written form in the 1st to 4th centuries CE in the southern regions of The Levant. With the advent of the early Arab conquests of the seventh and eighth centuries, Classical Arabic eventually replaced many (but not all) of the indigenous Semitic languages and cultures of the Near East. Both the Near East and North Africa saw an influx of Muslim Arabs from the Arabian Peninsula, followed later by non-Semitic Muslim Iranian and Turkic peoples. The previously dominant Aramaic dialects maintained by the Assyrians, Babylonians and Persians gradually began to be sidelined, however descendant dialects of Eastern Aramaic (including Suret (Assyrian and Chaldean varieties), Turoyo, and Mandaic) survive to this day among the Assyrians and Mandaeans of northern and southern Iraq, northwestern Iran, northeastern Syria and southeastern Turkey, with up to a million fluent speakers. Syriac is a recognized language in Iraq, furthermore, Mesopotamian Arabic is one of the most Syriac influenced dialects of Arabic, due to Syriac, the dialect of Edessa specifically, having originated in Mesopotamia. Meanwhile Western Aramaic is now only spoken by a few thousand Christian and Muslim Arameans (Syriacs) in western Syria. The Arabs spread their Central Semitic language to North Africa (Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and northern Sudan and Mauritania), where it gradually replaced Egyptian Coptic and many Berber languages (although Berber is still largely extant in many areas), and for a time to the Iberian Peninsula (modern Spain, Portugal, and Gibraltar) and Malta.
With the patronage of the caliphs and the prestige of its liturgical status, Arabic rapidly became one of the world&#x27;s main literary languages. Its spread among the masses took much longer, however, as many (although not all) of the native populations outside the Arabian Peninsula only gradually abandoned their languages in favour of Arabic. As Bedouin tribes settled in conquered areas, it became the main language of not only central Arabia, but also Yemen, the Fertile Crescent, and Egypt. Most of the Maghreb followed, specifically in the wake of the Banu Hilal&#x27;s incursion in the 11th century, and Arabic became the native language of many inhabitants of al-Andalus. After the collapse of the Nubian kingdom of Dongola in the 14th century, Arabic began to spread south of Egypt into modern Sudan; soon after, the Beni Ḥassān brought Arabization to Mauritania. A number of Modern South Arabian languages distinct from Arabic still survive, such as Soqotri, Mehri and Shehri which are mainly spoken in Socotra, Yemen, and Oman.

Meanwhile, the Semitic languages that had arrived from southern Arabia in the 8th century BC were diversifying in Ethiopia and Eritrea, where, under heavy Cushitic influence, they split into a number of languages, including Amharic and Tigrinya. With the expansion of Ethiopia under the Solomonic dynasty, Amharic, previously a minor local language, spread throughout much of the country, replacing both Semitic (such as Gafat) and non-Semitic (such as Weyto) languages, and replacing Geʽez as the principal literary language (though Geʽez remains the liturgical language for Christians in the region); this spread continues to this day, with Qimant set to disappear in another generation.

==Present distribution ==

Arabic is currently the native language of majorities from Mauritania to Oman, and from Iraq to Sudan. Classical Arabic is the language of the Quran. It is also studied widely in the non-Arabic-speaking Muslim world. The Maltese language is a descendant of the extinct Siculo-Arabic, a variety of Maghrebi Arabic formerly spoken in Sicily. The modern Maltese alphabet is based on the Latin script with the addition of some letters with diacritic marks and digraphs. Maltese is the only Semitic official language within the European Union.

Successful as second languages far beyond their numbers of contemporary first-language speakers, a few Semitic languages today are the base of the sacred literature of some of the world&#x27;s major religions, including Islam (Arabic), Judaism (Hebrew and Aramaic (Biblical and Talmudic)), churches of Syriac Christianity (Classical Syriac) and Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Christianity (Geʽez). Millions learn these as a second language (or an archaic version of their modern tongues): many Muslims learn to read and recite the Qur&#x27;an and Jews speak and study Biblical Hebrew, the language of the Torah, Midrash, and other Jewish scriptures. The followers of the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church, Ancient Church of the East, Assyrian Pentecostal Church, Assyrian Evangelical Church, and the Syriac Orthodox Church speak Eastern Aramaic languages and use Classical Syriac as their liturgical language. Classical Syriac is also used liturgically by the primarily Arabic-speaking followers of the Maronite Church, Syriac Catholic Church, and was originally the liturgical language of the Melkites in Antioch, and ancient Syria. Koine Greek and Classical Arabic are the main liturgical languages of Oriental Orthodox Christians in the Middle East, who compose the patriarchates of Antioch, Jerusalem, and Alexandria. Mandaic is both spoken and used as a liturgical language by the Mandaeans. Although the majority of Neo-Aramaic dialects spoken today are descended from Eastern varieties, Western Neo-Aramaic is still spoken in two villages in Syria.

Despite the ascendancy of Arabic in the Middle East, other Semitic languages still exist. Biblical Hebrew, long extinct as a colloquial language and in use only in Jewish literary, intellectual, and liturgical activity, was revived in spoken form at the end of the 19th century. Modern Hebrew is the main language of Israel, with Biblical Hebrew remaining as the language of liturgy and religious scholarship of Jews worldwide.

In Arab-dominated Yemen and Oman, on the southern rim of the Arabian Peninsula, a few tribes continue to speak Modern South Arabian languages such as Mahri and Soqotri. These languages differ greatly from both the surrounding Arabic dialects and from the languages of the Old South Arabian inscriptions.

Historically linked to the peninsular homeland of Old South Arabian, of which only one language, Razihi, remains, Ethiopia and Eritrea contain a substantial number of Semitic languages; the most widely spoken are Amharic in Ethiopia, Tigre in Eritrea, and Tigrinya in both. Amharic is the official language of Ethiopia. Tigrinya is a working language in Eritrea. Tigre is spoken by over one million people in the northern and central Eritrean lowlands and parts of eastern Sudan. A number of Gurage languages are spoken by populations in the semi-mountainous region of central Ethiopia, while Harari is restricted to the city of Harar. Geʽez remains the liturgical language for certain groups of Christians in Ethiopia and in Eritrea.

==Phonology==
The phonologies of the attested Semitic languages are presented here from a comparative point of view (see Proto-Semitic language#Phonology for details on the phonological reconstruction of Proto-Semitic used in this article). The reconstruction of Proto-Semitic (PS) was originally based primarily on Arabic, whose phonology and morphology (particularly in Classical Arabic) is very conservative, and which preserves as contrastive 28 out of the evident 29 consonantal phonemes. with and merging into Arabic and becoming Arabic .

Note: the fricatives *s, *z, *ṣ, *ś, *ṣ́, and *ṱ may also be interpreted as affricates (/t͡s/, /d͡z/, /t͡sʼ/, /t͡ɬ/, /t͡ɬʼ/, and /t͡θʼ/), as discussed in .

This comparative approach is natural for the consonants, as sound correspondences among the consonants of the Semitic languages are very straightforward for a family of its time depth. Sound shifts affecting the vowels are more numerous and, at times, less regular.

===Consonants===
Each Proto-Semitic phoneme was reconstructed to explain a certain regular sound correspondence between various Semitic languages. Note that Latin letter values (&quot;italicized&quot;) for extinct languages are a question of transcription; the exact pronunciation is not recorded.

Most of the attested languages have merged a number of the reconstructed original fricatives, though South Arabian retains all fourteen (and has added a fifteenth from *p &gt; f).

In Aramaic and Hebrew, all non-emphatic stops occurring singly after a vowel were softened to fricatives, leading to an alternation that was often later phonemicized as a result of the loss of gemination.

In languages exhibiting pharyngealization of emphatics, the original velar emphatic has rather developed to a uvular stop .

Note: the fricatives *s, *z, *ṣ, *ś, *ṣ́, and *ṱ may also be interpreted as affricates (/t͡s/, /d͡z/, /t͡sʼ/, /t͡ɬ/, /t͡ɬʼ/, and /t͡θʼ/).
Notes:
# Proto-Semitic was still pronounced as in Biblical Hebrew, but no letter was available in the Early Linear Script, so the letter ש did double duty, representing both and . Later on, however, merged with , but the old spelling was largely retained, and the two pronunciations of ש were distinguished graphically in Tiberian Hebrew as שׁ vs. שׂ &lt; .
# Biblical Hebrew as of the 3rd century BCE apparently still distinguished the phonemes and from and , respectively, based on transcriptions in the Septuagint. As in the case of , no letters were available to represent these sounds, and existing letters did double duty: ח and ע . In both of these cases, however, the two sounds represented by the same letter eventually merged, leaving no evidence (other than early transcriptions) of the former distinctions.
# Although early Aramaic (pre-7th century BCE) had only 22 consonants in its alphabet, it apparently distinguished all of the original 29 Proto-Semitic phonemes, including , , , , , , and although by Middle Aramaic times, these had all merged with other sounds. This conclusion is mainly based on the shifting representation of words etymologically containing these sounds; in early Aramaic writing, the first five are merged with , , , , and respectively, but later with , , , , and . (Also note that due to begadkefat spirantization, which occurred after this merger, OAm. t &gt; ṯ and d &gt; ḏ in some positions, so that PS *t,ṯ and *d, ḏ may be realized as either of t, ṯ and d, ḏ respectively.) The sounds and were always represented using the pharyngeal letters and , but they are distinguished from the pharyngeals in the Demotic-script papyrus Amherst 63, written about 200 BCE. This suggests that these sounds, too, were distinguished in Old Aramaic language, but written using the same letters as they later merged with.
# The earlier pharyngeals can be distinguished in Akkadian from the zero reflexes of *ḥ, *ʕ by e-coloring adjacent *a, e.g. pS &quot;*ˈbaʕal-um&quot; &#x27;owner, lord&#x27; &gt; Akk. &quot;bēlu(m)&quot;.
# Hebrew and Aramaic underwent begadkefat spirantization at a certain point, whereby the stop sounds were softened to the corresponding fricatives (written &quot;ḇ ḡ ḏ ḵ p̄ ṯ&quot;) when occurring after a vowel and not geminated. This change probably happened after the original Old Aramaic phonemes disappeared in the 7th century BCE, and most likely occurred after the loss of Hebrew . It is known to have occurred in Hebrew by the 2nd century CE. After a certain point this alternation became contrastive in word-medial and final position (though bearing low functional load), but in word-initial position they remained allophonic. In Modern Hebrew, the distinction has a higher functional load due to the loss of gemination, although only the three fricatives are still preserved (the fricative is pronounced in modern Hebrew). Samaritan Hebrew hasn&#x27;t undergone this process at all. 
# In the Northwest Semitic languages, became at the beginning of a word, e.g. Hebrew &quot;yeled&quot; &quot;boy&quot; &lt; &quot;*wald&quot; (cf. Arabic &quot;walad&quot;).
# There is evidence of a rule of assimilation of /j/ to the following coronal consonant in pre-tonic position, shared by Hebrew, Phoenician, and Aramaic.
# In Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, is nonexistent. In general cases, the language would lack pharyngeal fricative (as heard in &quot;Ayin&quot;). However, /ʕ/ is retained in educational speech, especially among Assyrian priests.
#The palatalization of Proto-Semitic gīm to Arabic jīm, is most probably connected to the pronunciation of qāf as a gāf (this sound change also occurred in Yemenite Hebrew), hence in most of the Arabian peninsula (which is the homeland of the Arabic language) is jīm and is gāf , except in western and southern Yemen and parts of Oman where is gīm and is qāf .
# Ugaritic orthography indicated the vowel after the glottal stop.
#The Arabic letter &quot; () has three main pronunciations in Modern Standard Arabic. in north Algeria, Iraq, also in most of the Arabian peninsula and as the predominant pronunciation of Literary Arabic outside the Arab world, occurs in most of the Levant and most North Africa; and is used in northern Egypt and some regions in Yemen and Oman. In addition to other minor allophones.
#The Arabic letter &quot; () has three main pronunciations in spoken varieties. in most of the Arabian Peninsula, Northern, and Eastern Yemen and parts of Oman, Southern Iraq, Upper Egypt, Sudan, Libya, some parts of the Levant, and to lesser extent in some parts (mostly rural) of Maghreb. in most of Tunisia, Algeria, and Morocco, Southern and Western Yemen, and parts of Oman, Northern Iraq, parts of the Levant, especially Druze dialects. in most of the Levant and Lower Egypt, as well as some North African towns such as Tlemcen and Fez. In addition to other minor allophones.
#&#x27; can be written &#x27;, and always is in the Ugaritic and Arabic contexts. In Ugaritic, sometimes assimilates to &quot;&quot;, as in &quot;ġmʔ&quot; &#x27;thirsty&#x27; (Arabic &quot;ẓmʔ&quot;, Hebrew &quot;ṣmʔ&quot;, but Ugaritic &quot;mẓmủ&quot; &#x27;thirsty&#x27;, root &quot;ẓmʔ&quot;, is also attested).
#Early Amharic might have had a different phonology.
#The pronunciations /ʕ/ and /ħ/ for &quot;ʿAyin&quot; and &quot;Ḥet&quot;, respectively, still occur among some older Mizrahi speakers, but for most modern Israelis, &quot;ʿAyin&quot; and &quot;Ḥet&quot; are realized as /ʔ, -/ and /χ ~ x/, respectively.

The following table shows the development of the various fricatives in Hebrew, Aramaic, Arabic and Maltese through cognate words:


===Vowels===

Proto-Semitic vowels are, in general, harder to deduce due to the nonconcatenative morphology of Semitic languages. The history of vowel changes in the languages makes drawing up a complete table of correspondences impossible, so only the most common reflexes can be given:

# in a stressed open syllable
# in a stressed closed syllable before a geminate
# in a stressed closed syllable before a consonant cluster
# when the proto-Semitic stressed vowel remained stressed
# pS *a,*ā &gt; Akk. e,ē in the neighborhood of pS *ʕ,*ħ and before r
# i.e. pS *g,*k,*ḳ,*χ &gt; Geʽez gʷ, kʷ,ḳʷ,χʷ / _u

==Grammar==
The Semitic languages share a number of grammatical features, although variation — both between separate languages, and within the languages themselves — has naturally occurred over time.

===Word order===
The reconstructed default word order in Proto-Semitic is verb–subject–object (VSO), possessed–possessor (NG), and noun–adjective (NA). This was still the case in Classical Arabic and Biblical Hebrew, e.g. Classical Arabic رأى محمد فريدا &quot;ra&#x27;ā muħammadun farīdan&quot;. (literally &quot;saw Muhammad Farid&quot;, &quot;Muhammad saw Farid&quot;). In the modern Arabic vernaculars, however, as well as sometimes in Modern Standard Arabic (the modern literary language based on Classical Arabic) and Modern Hebrew, the classical VSO order has given way to SVO. Modern Ethiopian Semitic languages follow a different word order: SOV, possessor–possessed, and adjective–noun; however, the oldest attested Ethiopian Semitic language, Geʽez, was VSO, possessed–possessor, and noun–adjective. Akkadian was also predominantly SOV.

===Cases in nouns and adjectives===
The proto-Semitic three-case system (nominative, accusative and genitive) with differing vowel endings (-u, -a -i), fully preserved in Qur&#x27;anic Arabic (see ʾIʿrab), Akkadian and Ugaritic, has disappeared everywhere in the many colloquial forms of Semitic languages. Modern Standard Arabic maintains such case distinctions, although they are typically lost in free speech due to colloquial influence. An accusative ending &quot;-n&quot; is preserved in Ethiopian Semitic. In the northwest, the scarcely attested Samalian reflects a case distinction in the plural between nominative &quot;-ū&quot; and oblique &quot;-ī&quot; (compare the same distinction in Classical Arabic). Additionally, Semitic nouns and adjectives had a category of state, the indefinite state being expressed by nunation.

===Number in nouns===
Semitic languages originally had three grammatical numbers: singular, dual, and plural. Classical Arabic still has a mandatory dual (i.e. it must be used in all circumstances when referring to two entities), marked on nouns, verbs, adjectives and pronouns. Many contemporary dialects of Arabic still have a dual, as in the name for the nation of Bahrain (&quot;baħr&quot; &quot;sea&quot; + &quot;-ayn&quot; &quot;two&quot;), although it is marked only on nouns. It also occurs in Hebrew in a few nouns (&quot;šana&quot; means &quot;one year&quot;, &quot;šnatayim&quot; means &quot;two years&quot;, and &quot;šanim&quot; means &quot;years&quot;), but for those it is obligatory. The curious phenomenon of broken pluralse.g. in Arabic, &quot;sadd&quot; &quot;one dam&quot; vs. &quot;sudūd&quot; &quot;dams&quot;found most profusely in the languages of Arabia and Ethiopia, may be partly of proto-Semitic origin, and partly elaborated from simpler origins.

===Verb aspect and tense===
All Semitic languages show two quite distinct styles of morphology used for conjugating verbs. &quot;Suffix conjugations&quot; take suffixes indicating the person, number and gender of the subject, which bear some resemblance to the pronominal suffixes used to indicate direct objects on verbs (&quot;I saw him&quot;) and possession on nouns (&quot;his dog&quot;). So-called &quot;prefix conjugations&quot; actually takes both prefixes and suffixes, with the prefixes primarily indicating person (and sometimes number or gender), while the suffixes (which are completely different from those used in the suffix conjugation) indicate number and gender whenever the prefix does not mark this. The prefix conjugation is noted for a particular pattern of &quot;&quot; prefixes where (1) a &quot;t-&quot; prefix is used in the singular to mark the second person and third-person feminine, while a &quot;y-&quot; prefix marks the third-person masculine; and (2) identical words are used for second-person masculine and third-person feminine singular. The prefix conjugation is extremely old, with clear analogues in nearly all the families of Afroasiatic languages (i.e. at least 10,000 years old). The table on the right shows examples of the prefix and suffix conjugations in Classical Arabic, which has forms that are close to Proto-Semitic.

In Proto-Semitic, as still largely reflected in East Semitic, prefix conjugations are used both for the past and the non-past, with different vocalizations. Cf. Akkadian &quot;niprus&quot; &quot;we decided&quot; (preterite), &quot;niptaras&quot; &quot;we have decided&quot; (perfect), &quot;niparras&quot; &quot;we decide&quot; (non-past or imperfect), vs. suffix-conjugated &quot;parsānu&quot; &quot;we are/were/will be deciding&quot; (stative). Some of these features, e.g. gemination indicating the non-past/imperfect, are generally attributed to Afroasiatic. Proto-Semitic had an additional form, the jussive, which was distinguished from the preterite only by the position of stress: the jussive had final stress while the preterite had non-final (retracted) stress.

The West Semitic languages significantly reshaped the system. The most substantial changes occurred in the Central Semitic languages (the ancestors of modern Hebrew, Arabic and Aramaic). Essentially, the old prefix-conjugated jussive or preterite became a new non-past (or imperfect), while the stative became a new past (or perfect), and the old prefix-conjugated non-past (or imperfect) with gemination was discarded. New suffixes were used to mark different moods in the non-past, e.g. Classical Arabic &quot;-u&quot; (indicative), &quot;-a&quot; (subjunctive), vs no suffix (jussive). It is not generally agreed whether the systems of the various Semitic languages are better interpreted in terms of tense, i.e. past vs. non-past, or aspect, i.e. perfect vs. imperfect. A special feature in classical Hebrew is the waw-consecutive, prefixing a verb form with the letter waw in order to change its tense or aspect. The South Semitic languages show a system somewhere between the East and Central Semitic languages.

Later languages show further developments. In the modern varieties of Arabic, for example, the old mood suffixes were dropped, and new mood prefixes developed (e.g. &quot;bi-&quot; for indicative vs. no prefix for subjunctive in many varieties). In the extreme case of Neo-Aramaic, the verb conjugations have been entirely reworked under Iranian influence.

===Morphology: triliteral roots===

All Semitic languages exhibit a unique pattern of stems called Semitic roots consisting typically of triliteral, or three-consonant consonantal roots (two- and four-consonant roots also exist), from which nouns, adjectives, and verbs are formed in various ways (e.g., by inserting vowels, doubling consonants, lengthening vowels or by adding prefixes, suffixes, or infixes).

For instance, the root &quot;k-t-b&quot; (dealing with &quot;writing&quot; generally) yields in Arabic:

:&quot;katabtu&quot; كَتَبْتُ or كتبت &quot;I wrote&quot; (f and m)
:&quot;yuktab(u)&quot; يُكْتَب or يكتب &quot;being written&quot; (masculine)
:&quot;tuktab(u)&quot; تُكتَب or تكتب &quot;being written&quot; (feminine)
:&quot;yatakātabūn(a)&quot; يَتَكَاتَبُونَ or يتكاتبون &quot;they write to each other&quot; (masculine)
:&quot;istiktāb&quot; اِستِكتاب or استكتاب &quot;causing to write&quot;
:kitāb كِتَاب or كتاب &quot;book&quot; (the hyphen shows end of stem before various case endings)
:kutayyib كُتَيِّب or كتيب &quot;booklet&quot; (diminutive)
:&quot;kitābat&quot; كِتَابَة or كتابة &quot;writing&quot;
:kuttāb كُتاب or كتاب &quot;writers&quot; (broken plural)
:&quot;katabat&quot; كَتَبَة or كتبة &quot;clerks&quot; (broken plural)
:&quot;maktab&quot; مَكتَب or مكتب &quot;desk&quot; or &quot;office&quot;
:&quot;maktabat&quot; مَكتَبة or مكتبة &quot;library&quot; or &quot;bookshop&quot;
:&quot;maktūb&quot; مَكتوب or مكتوب &quot;written&quot; (participle) or &quot;postal letter&quot; (noun)
:&quot;katībat&quot; كَتيبة or كتيبة &quot;squadron&quot; or &quot;document&quot;
:&quot;iktitāb&quot; اِكتِتاب or اكتتاب &quot;registration&quot; or &quot;contribution of funds&quot;
:&quot;muktatib&quot; مُكتَتِب or مكتتب &quot;subscription&quot;

and the same root in Hebrew:

:&quot;kāṯaḇti&quot; כתבתי or כָּתַבְתִּי &quot;I wrote&quot;
:kattāḇ כתב or כַּתָּב &quot;reporter&quot; (&quot;m&quot;)
:&quot;katteḇeṯ&quot; כתבת or כַּתָּבֶת &quot;reporter&quot; (&quot;f&quot;)
:kattāḇā&quot; כתבה or כַּתָּבָה &quot;article&quot; (plural kattāḇōṯ&quot; כתבות)
:&quot;miḵtāḇ&quot; מכתב or מִכְתָּב &quot;postal letter&quot; (plural &quot;miḵtāḇīm&quot; מכתבים)
:&quot;miḵtāḇā&quot; מכתבה &quot;writing desk&quot; (plural &quot;miḵtāḇōṯ&quot; מכתבות)
:kəṯōḇeṯ&quot; כתובת &quot;address&quot; (plural kəṯōḇōṯ&quot; כתובות)
:kəṯāḇ כתב &quot;handwriting&quot;
:kāṯūḇ כתוב &quot;written&quot; (&quot;f&quot; &quot;kəṯūḇā&quot; כתובה)
:&quot;hiḵtīḇ&quot; הכתיב &quot;he dictated&quot; (&quot;f&quot; &quot;hiḵtīḇā&quot; הכתיבה)
:&quot;hiṯkattēḇ&quot; התכתב &quot;he corresponded (&quot;f&quot; &quot;hiṯkattəḇā&quot; התכתבה)
:&quot;niḵtaḇ&quot; נכתב &quot;it was written&quot; (&quot;m&quot;)
:&quot;niḵtəḇā&quot; נכתבה &quot;it was written&quot; (&quot;f&quot;)
:kəṯīḇ כתיב &quot;spelling&quot; (&quot;m&quot;)
:&quot;taḵtīḇ&quot; תכתיב &quot;prescript&quot; (&quot;m&quot;)
:&quot;mə&#x27;ḵuttāḇ מכותב &quot;addressee&quot; (&quot;meḵutteḇ&quot;&#x27;eṯ&quot; מכותבת &quot;f&quot;)
:&quot;kəṯubbā&quot; כתובה &quot;ketubah (a Jewish marriage contract)&quot; (&quot;f&quot;)

(Underlined consonants , , represent the fricatives /x/, /θ/, /v/ respectively.)

In Tigrinya and Amharic, this root was used widely but is now seen as an archaic form. Ethiopic-derived languages use different roots for things that have to do with writing (and in some cases counting). The primitive root &quot;ṣ-f&quot; and the trilateral root stems &quot;m-ṣ-f&quot;, &quot;ṣ-h-f&quot;, and &quot;ṣ-f-r&quot; are used. This root also exists in other Semitic languages, such as Hebrew: &quot;sep̄er&quot; &quot;book&quot;, &quot;sōp̄er&quot; &quot;scribe&quot;, &quot;mispār&quot; &quot;number&quot;, and &quot;sippūr&quot; &quot;story&quot;. This root also exists in Arabic and is used to form words with a close meaning to &quot;writing&quot;, such as &quot;ṣaḥāfa&quot; &quot;journalism&quot;, and &quot;ṣaḥīfa&quot; &quot;newspaper&quot; or &quot;parchment&quot;.
Verbs in other non-Semitic Afroasiatic languages show similar radical patterns, but more usually with biconsonantal roots; e.g. Kabyle &quot;afeg&quot; means &quot;fly!&quot;, while &quot;affug&quot; means &quot;flight&quot;, and &quot;yufeg&quot; means &quot;he flew&quot; (compare with Hebrew, where &quot;hap̄lēḡ&quot; means &quot;set sail!&quot;, &quot;hap̄lāḡā&quot; means &quot;a sailing trip&quot;, and &quot;hip̄līḡ&quot; means &quot;he sailed&quot;, while the unrelated &quot;ʕūp̄&quot;, &quot;təʕūp̄ā&quot;, and &quot;ʕāp̄&quot; pertain to flight).

===Independent personal pronouns===
===Cardinal numerals===

These are the basic numeral stems without feminine suffixes. In most older Semitic languages, the forms of the numerals from 3 to 10 exhibit polarity of gender (also called &quot;chiastic concord&quot; or &quot;reverse agreement&quot;), i.e. if the counted noun is masculine, the numeral would be feminine and vice versa.

===Typology===

Some early Semitic languages are speculated to have had weak ergative features.

==Common vocabulary==
Due to the Semitic languages&#x27; common origin, they share some words and roots. Others differ. For example:

Terms given in brackets are not derived from the respective Proto-Semitic roots, though they may also derive from Proto-Semitic (as does e.g. Arabic &quot;dār&quot;, cf. Biblical Hebrew &quot;dōr&quot; &quot;dwelling&quot;).

Sometimes, certain roots differ in meaning from one Semitic language to another. For example, the root &quot;b-y-ḍ&quot; in Arabic has the meaning of &quot;white&quot; as well as &quot;egg&quot;, whereas in Hebrew it only means &quot;egg&quot;. The root &quot;l-b-n&quot; means &quot;milk&quot; in Arabic, but the color &quot;white&quot; in Hebrew. The root &quot;l-ḥ-m&quot; means &quot;meat&quot; in Arabic, but &quot;bread&quot; in Hebrew and &quot;cow&quot; in Ethiopian Semitic; the original meaning was most probably &quot;food&quot;. The word &quot;medina&quot; (root: &quot;d-y-n&quot;/&quot;d-w-n&quot;) has the meaning of &quot;metropolis&quot; in Amharic, &quot;city&quot; in Arabic and Ancient Hebrew, and &quot;State&quot; in Modern Hebrew.

There is sometimes no relation between the roots. For example, &quot;knowledge&quot; is represented in Hebrew by the root &quot;y-d-ʿ&quot;, but in Arabic by the roots &quot;ʿ-r-f&quot; and &quot;ʿ-l-m&quot; and in Ethiosemitic by the roots &quot;ʿ-w-q&quot; and &quot;f-l-ṭ&quot;.

For more comparative vocabulary lists, see the Wiktionary appendix .

==Classification==
There are six fairly uncontroversial nodes within the Semitic languages: East Semitic, Northwest Semitic, North Arabian, Old South Arabian (also known as Sayhadic), Modern South Arabian, and Ethiopian Semitic. These are generally grouped further, but there is ongoing debate as to which belong together. The classification based on shared innovations given below, established by Robert Hetzron in 1976 and with later emendations by John Huehnergard and Rodgers as summarized in Hetzron 1997, is the most widely accepted today. In particular, several Semiticists still argue for the traditional (partially nonlinguistic) view of Arabic as part of South Semitic, and a few (e.g. Alexander Militarev or the German-Egyptian professor Arafa Hussein Mustafa) see Modern South Arabian as a third branch of Semitic alongside East and West Semitic, rather than as a subgroup of South Semitic. However, a new classification groups Old South Arabian as Central Semitic instead.

Roger Blench notes that the Gurage languages are highly divergent and wonders whether they might not be a primary branch, reflecting an origin of Afroasiatic in or near Ethiopia. At a lower level, there is still no general agreement on where to draw the line between &quot;languages&quot; and &quot;dialects&quot;an issue particularly relevant in Arabic, Aramaic and Gurageand the strong mutual influences between Arabic dialects render a genetic subclassification of them particularly difficult.

A computational phylogenetic analysis by Kitchen et al. (2009) considers the Semitic languages to have originated in the Levant during the Early Bronze Age, with early Ethiosemitic originating from southern Arabia . Evidence for gene movements consistent with this were found in Almarri et al. (2021).

The Himyaritic and Sutean languages appear to have been Semitic, but are unclassified due to insufficient data.

<doc id="26920" wikidata="Q455117" url="?curid=26920" title="Sammy Sosa">
<text>Samuel Peralta Sosa (; born November 12, 1968) is a Dominican-American former professional baseball right fielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 18 seasons, primarily with the Chicago Cubs. After playing for the Texas Rangers and Chicago White Sox, Sosa joined the Cubs in 1992 and became regarded as one of the game&#x27;s best hitters. Sosa hit his 400th home run in his 1,354th game and his 5,273rd at-bat, reaching this milestone quicker than any player in National League history. He is one of nine players in MLB history to hit 600 career home runs.

In 1998, Sosa, along with Mark McGwire, achieved international fame for his home run-hitting prowess in pursuit of Roger Maris&#x27; single-season home-run record. With the Cubs, Sosa became a 7-time All-Star while holding numerous team records. He finished his career with stints with the Baltimore Orioles and the Rangers for a second time. With the Rangers, Sosa hit his 600th career home run to become the fifth player in MLB history to reach the milestone.

Sosa is second all-time in home runs among foreign-born MLB players and is one of only three National League players since 1900 to reach 160 RBIs in one season (2001). He is also the only player to have hit 60 or more home runs in a single season three times, which he accomplished in 1998, 1999 and 2001. He did not lead the league in home runs in any of those seasons, although he did lead the league in 2000 with 50 home runs, and in 2002 with 49.

In a 2005 congressional hearing, Sosathrough his attorneydenied having used performance-enhancing drugs during his playing career, following multiple accusations. In a 2024 public statement, Sosa admitted to having made &quot;mistakes&quot; recovering from injuries during his career. 
==Early life==
Sosa was born in the Dominican Republic. Though born in a Batey community in Consuelo, his officially registered birthplace is San Pedro de Macorís, which was &quot;the largest town nearby&quot;. Sosa is known to family and friends as &quot;Mikey&quot;. His maternal grandmother suggested his birth name of Samuel, and also came up with his nickname: &quot;[She] heard the name on a soap opera she liked and decided from that moment on he would be Mikey.&quot;

==Professional career==
===Texas Rangers (1989)===
Sosa made his major league debut on June 16, 1989, with the Texas Rangers, wearing #17 and leading off as the starting left fielder. He hit his first career home run off Roger Clemens.

===Chicago White Sox (1989–1991)===
On July 29, 1989, the Rangers traded Sosa with Wilson Álvarez and Scott Fletcher to the Chicago White Sox for Harold Baines and Fred Manrique. In 1990, Sosa batted .233 with 15 home runs, 70 runs batted in, 10 triples, and 32 stolen bases. He also struck out 150 times, fourth most in the American League. Sosa started the 1991 season by hitting two home runs and driving in five runs. However, he slumped for the rest of the year and batted .203 with 10 home runs and 33 runs batted in.

===Chicago Cubs (1992–2004)===
The White Sox traded Sosa and Ken Patterson to the Chicago Cubs for outfielder George Bell before the 1992 season. Sosa batted .260 with eight home runs and 25 RBIs in his first season with the Cubs. In 1993, Sosa batted .261 with 33 home runs with 93 RBIs. He also showed his speed by stealing 38 bases and became the Cubs&#x27; first 30-30 player. Sosa continued to hit for power and speed in 1994 but he also improved his batting average. He ended up batting .300 with 25 home runs, 70 RBIs, and 22 stolen bases. Sosa was named to his first All-Star team in 1995. In 144 games, he batted .268 with 36 home runs and 119 RBIs. Sosa continued his success with the Cubs in 1996 as he batted .273 with 40 home runs and 100 RBIs. However, in 1997, Sosa batted just .251 with a .300 on-base percentage, and led the league in strikeouts with 174 despite hitting 36 home runs with 119 RBIs.

After years as a respected power/speed threat with a rocket arm in right field, he emerged during the 1998 season as one of baseball&#x27;s greatest. It was in this season that both Sosa and Mark McGwire were involved in the &quot;home run record chase&quot;, when both players&#x27; prowess for hitting home runs drew national attention as they attempted to pass Roger Maris&#x27; single season home run mark of 61 home runs. In the early months of the year, Sosa trailed McGwire significantly, being as many as 16 homers behind at one point in May. But as the chase progressed, Sosa eventually tied McGwire with 46 home runs on August 10. However, McGwire pulled away slightly and reached 62 home runs to break the record first on September 8. Sosa tied McGwire once again at 62 on September 13. Eleven days later, with two games left to play in the season, the two were tied at 66 home runs each. Sosa ended the season with 66, finishing behind McGwire&#x27;s 70. It was during that season that Cubs announcer Chip Caray nicknamed him &quot;Slammin&#x27; Sammy&quot;, a nickname that quickly spread. Sammy produced then career-highs in batting average and slugging percentage, at .308 and .647 respectively. Sosa also led the league in RBIs and runs scored.

 Also in 1998, Sosa&#x27;s 416 total bases were the most in a single season since Stan Musial&#x27;s 429 in 1948. Sosa&#x27;s performance in the month of June, during which Sosa belted 20 home runs, knocked in 47 runs, and posted an .842 slugging percentage, was one of the greatest offensive outbursts in major league history. Sosa won the National League Most Valuable Player Award for leading the Cubs into the playoffs in 1998, earning every first-place vote except for the two cast by St. Louis writers, who voted for McGwire. He and McGwire shared &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine&#x27;s 1998 &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; award. Sosa was honored with a ticker-tape parade in his honor in New York City, and he was invited to be a guest at US President Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1999 State of the Union Address. 1998 was also the first time the Cubs made the post-season since 1989. The Cubs qualified as the NL Wild Card team, but were swept by the Atlanta Braves in the NLDS. In the 1999 season, Sosa hit 63 home runs, again trailing Mark McGwire, who hit 65. In the 2000 season, Sosa led the league by hitting 50 home runs. He received the Babe Ruth Home Run Award for leading MLB in homers.
In 2001, he hit 64 home runs, becoming the first player to hit 60 or more home runs three times. However, he did not lead the league in any of those seasons; in 2001, he finished behind Barry Bonds, who hit 73 homers, breaking the single-season home run record set by McGwire in 1998 (70). In 2001, he also set personal records in runs scored (146), RBI (160), walks (116), on-base percentage (.437), slugging percentage (.737), and batting average (.328). He led the majors in runs and RBI, was second in home runs, second in slugging percentage, first in total bases, third in walks, fourth in on-base percentage, 12th in batting average, and 15th in hits. He also surpassed his 1998 number in total bases, racking up 425. Sosa once again led the league in home runs with 49 in 2002. In recognition of his accomplishments as a hitter, Sosa won the Silver Slugger Award (an award for offensive output, voted on by managers and coaches) in 1995 and in 1998 through 2002.
In 2003, the Cubs won the National League Central Division title. In May, he spent his first period on the disabled list since 1996 after having an injured toenail removed. On June 3, 2003, Sosa was ejected from a Chicago Cubs-Tampa Bay Devil Rays game in the first inning when umpires discovered he had been using a corked bat. Major League Baseball confiscated and tested 76 of Sosa&#x27;s other bats after his ejection; all were found to be clean, with no cork. Five bats he had sent to the Hall of Fame in past years were also tested, and were all clean as well. Sosa stated that he had accidentally used the corked bat, which he claimed he only used during batting practice, and apologized for the incident. When Cubs manager Dusty Baker was interviewed later, he stated any use of corked bats on his team is strictly prohibited. On June 6, Sosa was suspended for eight games all without pay which was reduced to seven games (again without pay) on June 11 after appeal. Sosa finished the season with 40 home runs and hit two more in the 2003 NLCS against the Florida Marlins, falling to the team in seven games.
In May 2004, Sosa suffered an odd injury while sitting next to his locker chatting with reporters before a game in San Diego&#x27;s Petco Park. He sneezed very violently, causing severe back pain. He was diagnosed with back spasms and placed on the disabled list. He finished with 35 homers, far below his numbers of his best years. Despite his declining production and release from the team at the end of the 2004 season, between 1995 and 2004 Sosa clubbed 479 home runs which is the most home runs by a player in history over a 10-year span. He also owns numerous team records for the Cubs and he holds the major-league record for the most home runs hit in a month (20, in June 1998). His tenure came to an end without fanfare, as he did not play in the final game of the regular season (played in Chicago) per his request, with Sosa reportedly leaving Wrigley Field before the game had ended. Sosa had stated he had permission from Baker to not play, while Baker stated that former assistant trainer Sandy Krum (serving as the go-between for the two) told Baker that Sosa had felt a bit injured and wanted out of the final game, but he expected Sosa to be on the bench who weren&#x27;t in the starting lineup.

===Baltimore Orioles (2005)===

On January 28, 2005, the Cubs traded Sosa to the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for infielder-outfielder Jerry Hairston Jr., infielder Mike Fontenot, and RHP Dave Crouthers. To facilitate the deal, Sosa and his agent agreed to waive the clause that guaranteed his 2006 salary, and the players&#x27; union indicated it would not object to that agreement. Under the deal, Sosa earned $17.875 million for the 2005 season, with the Cubs paying $7 million of his salary. By playing for the 2005 Orioles alongside fellow 500-home-run batter Rafael Palmeiro, Sosa and Palmeiro became the first 500 home run club members in history to play together on the same team after reaching the 500 home run plateau. Sosa finished the 2005 season batting .221 with 14 home runs, his worst performance since 1992, and continuing his post-2001 trend of declines in batting average, homers, total bases, and RBI. On December 7, 2005, the Orioles decided not to offer him an arbitration contract, effectively ending his Baltimore Orioles tenure and making him a free agent.
In 2005, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; published an update of their 1999 book &quot;Baseball&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players&quot;. Sosa did not make the original edition, but for the 2005 update, with his career totals considerably higher, he was ranked at Number 95. During a stretch of nine consecutive years, Sosa hit 35 or more home runs and 100+ RBIs, all with the Chicago Cubs.

===Year off (2006)===
At the end of January 2006, the Washington Nationals offered Sosa two different minor-league offers, both of which he turned down. On February 15, 2006, Sosa&#x27;s agent Adam Katz stated: &quot;We&#x27;re not going to put him on the retirement list. We decided that [not putting him on that list] was the best thing to do. But I can say, with reasonable certainty, that we&#x27;ve seen Sammy in a baseball uniform for the last time.&quot; During that year, Sosa accompanied President Leonel Fernández of the Dominican Republic on several diplomatic trips including to the United States, Japan, and Taiwan.

===Texas Rangers (2007)===

The Texas Rangers, Sosa&#x27;s original team, signed him to a minor league deal worth $500,000 on January 30, 2007. This was the same contract that Sosa turned down the previous year from the Nationals. The contract included an invitation to spring training, where Sosa competed for a spot in the lineup with Nelson Cruz, Jason Botts, and other rookies/prospects. Sosa was successful during spring training and was added to the team&#x27;s 25-man roster. He started the 2007 season as the Rangers&#x27; designated hitter and occasional right fielder.
At the same time, the Chicago Cubs awarded Sosa&#x27;s number 21 to new pitcher Jason Marquis, who coincidentally served up Sosa&#x27;s 600th career home run. This caused some concern, due to Sosa&#x27;s accomplishments with the Cubs, including his status as the Cubs&#x27; all-time home run leader.

On April 26, 2007, Sosa made history by hitting a home run in his 45th major league ballpark. He has also homered in The Ballpark at Disney&#x27;s Wide World of Sports, near Orlando, Florida, a usually minor-league and Spring training park that hosted a regular season series between the Rangers and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in May 2007, although he did not hit a homer at the two regular season games the Cubs played at the Tokyo Dome in 2000 vs. the Mets. On June 20, 2007, Sosa hit a home run off of Jason Marquis during an inter-league game against the Chicago Cubs. Sosa became only the fifth man in history, following Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, and Barry Bonds, to hit 600 regular season home runs. The home run was the first one that Sosa had recorded against the Cubs, and as a result he has hit a home run against every active MLB team. Sosa is the Cubs&#x27; all-time home run leader, having hit 545 with that team.

===End of career (2008–2009)===
On May 28, 2008, Sosa announced that he instructed his agent not to offer his services to any MLB team for the 2008 season, and planned on filing for retirement, but never did. On December 25, 2008, Sosa announced he intended to unretire and play in the World Baseball Classic and once again test the free agent market in hopes of signing with a Major League ballclub in 2009. Sosa said that he had been keeping in shape at his home, and was hoping that after a strong World Baseball Classic he would prove to major-league teams that he was still capable of playing in MLB. However, he was not selected as part of the Dominican Republic&#x27;s roster. He remained a free agent and did not actively look for a team.

On June 3, 2009, Sosa announced his intention to retire from baseball. He made the announcement in the Dominican Republic and said that he was calmly looking forward to his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame since his statistics were up to par.

==Drug test controversy==

On June 16, 2009, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Sosa was on a list of players who had tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs in 2003, in baseball&#x27;s steroids scandal. The paper stated that this information had been obtained from unnamed attorneys with knowledge of Major League Baseball drug test results from 2003.

Previously, Sosa sat alongside Rafael Palmeiro, Jose Canseco, and Mark McGwire at a hearing before the United States Congress. His attorney testified on his behalf, stating, &quot;To be clear, I have never taken illegal performance-enhancing drugs. I have never injected myself or had anyone inject me with anything. I have not broken the laws of the United States or the laws of the Dominican Republic. I have been tested as recently as 2004, and I am clean.&quot;

On December 19, 2024, Sosa released a somewhat ambiguous public statement through his PR firm, stating, &quot;There were times I did whatever I could to recover from injuries in an effort to keep my strength up to perform over 162 games. I never broke any laws, but in hindsight, I made mistakes and I apologize.&quot; Almost immediately, Cubs chairman Thomas S. Ricketts responded with a statement of his own, inviting Sosa to the 2025 Cubs Convention: &quot;We appreciate Sammy releasing his statement and for reaching out. No one played harder or wanted to win more…We plan on inviting him to the 2025 Cubs Convention and, while it is short notice, we hope that he can attend. We are all ready to move forward together.&quot;

==National Baseball Hall of Fame consideration==
In an interview with ESPN Deportes, Sosa said he would &quot;calmly wait&quot; for his induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, for which he became eligible in 2013. In results announced on January 9, 2013, Sosa was not elected by the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA) into baseball&#x27;s Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, receiving 12.5% in his first year on the ballot—the requirement for election is 75%. In the following years, his voting percentage dropped as low as 6.6% in 2015 to a high of 17% in 2021. A candidate remains eligible for inclusion on subsequent ballots as long as he receives a minimum of 5.0% of the vote in a given year, and is removed from consideration by the BBWAA after 10 years of not being elected; thus, Sosa&#x27;s final appearance was on the 2022 ballot, where he received 18.5% of votes.

==Personal life==
Sosa is married to Sonia Rodríguez, a former Dominican TV dancer, with whom he has four children. In 2009, Sosa appeared at a music awards show looking much lighter in complexion than he had just months earlier. The buzz around this drastic change prompted him to go on a Spanish-language television station to deny that he was ill, or that he hated being dark-skinned, or that his new skin tone was the result of steroid use. Sosa explained that he uses a bleaching cream before going to bed that softens and lightens his skin.

<text>Spenser is a fictional private investigator created by the American mystery writer Robert B. Parker. He acts as the protagonist of a series of detective novels written by Parker and later continued by Ace Atkins and Mike Lupica. His first appearance was in the 1973 novel &quot;The Godwulf Manuscript&quot;. He is also featured in the 1980s television series &quot;&quot; and a related series of TV movies based on the novels. In March 2020 he was featured in the Netflix thriller film &quot;Spenser Confidential&quot;.

Spenser is only referred to by his surname in the novels, but the television series has him introduce himself as &quot;David Spenser&quot; to a cop sitting at the diner in the fifteenth episode of season 2. Also, Spenser is addressed as &quot;Jim&quot; at the end of Chapter 9 of &quot;The Godwulf Manuscript&quot; though this was probably a casual address by a stranger, akin to &quot;Mac&quot; or &quot;Buddy.&quot;

==Fictional biography==
Spenser was born and grew up in Laramie, Wyoming and is a Boston private eye in the mold of Raymond Chandler&#x27;s Philip Marlowe, a smart-mouthed tough guy with a heart of gold. Unlike Marlowe, Spenser maintains a committed relationship with one woman (Susan Silverman, a psychologist). He is an ex-boxer who likes to remind readers that he once fought the former heavyweight champ Jersey Joe Walcott, and he lifts weights to stay in shape. He is quite well educated, cooks, and lives by a code of honor he and Susan discuss occasionally—though as infrequently as he can manage.

Like his creator, Robert B. Parker, Spenser is a Bostonian, and spent time in Korea with the U.S. Army. Spenser served as an infantryman in the 1st Infantry Division during the Korean War.

Spenser is a former State trooper investigator assigned to the Suffolk County District Attorney&#x27;s (DA) Office (although some novels state that he also worked out of the Middlesex County DA&#x27;s Office; &quot;Walking Shadow&quot; and the pilot episode of &quot;&quot; say he was a Boston Police detective), and regularly seeks help from (or sometimes butts heads with) Martin Quirk. Quirk is originally a police lieutenant, later a captain, and he rises to an assistant superintendent (according to &quot;Little White Lies&quot;) of the Boston Police Department. Among his other police contacts are Sergeant Frank Belson and Detective Lee Farrell, both homicide investigators under Quirk&#x27;s command; Healy, a captain of the Massachusetts State Police; and Mark Samuelson, an LAPD lieutenant (later promoted to captain, as mentioned in &quot;Back Story&quot;). In Massachusetts, each county District Attorney&#x27;s office has a squad of State Police Detectives assigned to their office to conduct investigations of major crimes committed in their jurisdictions.

Scotch is Spenser&#x27;s drink of celebration. This is mostly having to do with an encounter with a bear while bird hunting in his teens. Spenser seems to agree with William Faulkner&#x27;s assessment of Scotch — &quot;that brown liquor which not women, not boys and children, but only hunters drank.&quot; He also frequently drinks Irish Whiskey, sometimes just as a nod to his ethnic heritage, saying “The thing I like about Irish whiskey is that the more you drink the smoother it goes down. Of course that&#x27;s probably true of antifreeze as well, but illusion is nearly all we have.”

One of the inconsistencies or possible cases of retroactive continuity within the Spenser series surrounds his mother. In some of the early books he refers to his mother and, in 1981&#x27;s &quot;A Savage Place&quot;, for example, he quotes advice his mother gave him. By &quot;A Catskill Eagle&quot;, Spenser states that his mother died during labor and he was delivered via Caesarean section, i.e. &quot;not of woman born&quot; as Parker has Spenser put it; he was raised by his father and his two maternal uncles, all of them carpenters, who do not appear in the series. Spenser received a football scholarship to Holy Cross, where he played strong safety. Spenser injured his knee and dropped out because he did not have the funds to complete his schooling. He took up boxing, and met Hawk, a tough man skilled with firearms, and Henry Cimoli, the owner of a gym where Spenser and Hawk still work out. His family unit beyond his near-fraternal relationship with Hawk is essentially Susan Silverman, an unofficial foster son named Paul Giacomin, and a series of dogs all named Pearl after Spenser&#x27;s childhood dog of the same breed, a German Shorthaired Pointer. Silverman, originally a high school guidance counselor, continues to assist Spenser in his cases after becoming a Harvard-trained Ph.D. psychologist. Giacomin, initially an awkward, unsocialized teenager, becomes a professional actor and dancer.

===Hawk===
The other major character in the Spenser novels is his close friend Hawk, originally introduced in the fourth novel &quot;Promised Land&quot;. A black man, Hawk is an equally tough but somewhat shady echo of Spenser himself. Hawk served in the French Foreign Legion and in combat operations overseas. Hawk is a &quot;Gun for Hire&quot; who lives by his own personal code. Spenser and Hawk met as boxing opponents during a preliminary bout in the Boston Arena (now known as Matthews Arena). Each man believes he was the victor. Spenser and Hawk respect each other and are friends who each understand the other&#x27;s philosophy of how to conduct themselves in life. Hawk received his own television series, &quot;A Man Called Hawk&quot;, in 1989.

===Young Spenser===
Released in 2009, a young adult novel, &quot;Chasing the Bear&quot;, discusses some of Spenser&#x27;s childhood, and further complicates the continuity issue with his family. At the end of the novel, Spenser leaves his father and uncles behind in Wyoming to attend college in Boston. No information was released as to whether this would commence a fourth regular series for Parker before his death in January 2010.

===Spenser&#x27;s firearms===
In the 1970s and 1980s, Spenser usually carried a Smith &amp; Wesson Model 36 in .38 Special caliber, &quot;Chief&#x27;s Special&quot; revolver. He would sometimes carry a .357 Magnum revolver that he usually kept in the top drawer of his office desk, for &quot;just in case&quot; situations. Spenser also had a small .32 caliber revolver that he carried as a &quot;backup&quot; weapon in the 1970s and early 1980s. In the novel &quot;The Widening Gyre&quot;, Spenser carried a .25 caliber semiautomatic as a backup, and had it in his hand when confronted by two assassins - killing both. In 1992, Spenser started regularly carrying a Browning Hi-Power 9mm semi-automatic pistol. In 2010, Spenser replaces the Browning with a Smith &amp; Wesson .40 caliber semi-automatic pistol. In 2012, he starts carrying the Chief&#x27;s Special again while working, but also carries the .357 Magnum or the .40 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson, in addition to the .38 Special, when anticipating a possible gunfight. On rare occasions, Spenser would use a rifle or shotgun when the situation required them. Spenser of the TV show carried a Beretta 92 9mm semi-automatic pistol. He also used a revolver, mostly in the first season.

==Adaptations==

The universe depicted in the TV episodes and movies diverges from that in the novels, though many of the filmed presentations are based on, and named after, novels in the series.

===Spenser TV series===

The Spenser books were the inspiration for the 1985-1988 ABC TV series &quot;&quot; starring Robert Urich as Spenser, Barbara Stock as Susan, and Avery Brooks as Hawk. All three seasons of the series have been released on DVD by the Warner Archive Collection.

Avery Brooks starred in a spin-off series entitled &quot;A Man Called Hawk&quot;.

===First Spenser film series===
Four made-for-TV movies based upon the series were produced by the Lifetime cable network between 1993 and 1995, again starring Robert Urich and Avery Brooks. The movies were based on four of Parker&#x27;s novels: &quot;Ceremony&quot;, &quot;Pale Kings and Princes&quot;, &quot;The Judas Goat&quot; and &quot;A Savage Place&quot;. Parker and his wife Joan co-wrote the first two screenplays. Barbara Stock was replaced as Susan Silverman in the first two movies by Barbara Williams and in the last two by veteran actress Wendy Crewson (&quot;Air Force One&quot;). Frank Belson was played by J. Winston Carroll. Parker&#x27;s son Daniel appears in all four movies as a waiter in Spenser&#x27;s favorite restaurant. Unlike the series, which was filmed in Boston, the new movies were filmed in Toronto (to take advantage of lower production costs). The first two movies retained the novels&#x27; Boston setting (parts of Toronto passed for Boston), while the second two were re-written to take place in Toronto.

===Second Spenser film series===

Beginning in 1999, Joe Mantegna played Spenser in three TV movies on the A&amp;E cable network: &quot;Small Vices&quot; (1999), &quot;Thin Air&quot; (2000), &quot;Walking Shadow&quot; (2001). Marcia Gay Harden played Susan, while Shiek Mahmud-Bey and, later, Ernie Hudson played Hawk. Robert B. Parker had a significant role in the development of the TV movies (all three films were adapted by Parker, with his wife co-authoring &quot;Walking Shadow&quot;).

===Spenser Netflix movie===

&quot;Spenser Confidential&quot; (formerly called &quot;Wonderland&quot;) is a mystery film directed by Peter Berg and written by Sean O&#x27;Keefe. The film is very loosely based on the 2013 novel by Ace Atkins, an authorized continuation of the Spenser series. It uses the names of characters from the series of novels and a Boston setting, but otherwise departs substantially from the Parker/Atkins novels. The film stars Mark Wahlberg as Spenser, Winston Duke as Hawk and Alan Arkin as Henry Cimoli. Post Malone, Iliza Shlesinger, Bokeem Woodbine and Donald Cerrone also appear. &quot;Spenser Confidential&quot; was released by Netflix in March 2020. The movie received generally negative reviews, with Atkins taking negative swipes at both Wahlberg and the movie itself in the pages of the two Spenser novels released after the movie.

==Shared universe==
Spenser and Hawk live in the same Boston literary universe as Parker&#x27;s other, later series characters: private investigator Sunny Randall and small town police chief Jesse Stone, the former of whom was possibly mentioned in passing as a blonde jogging with an English bull terrier, while the latter had a much larger role in &quot;Back Story&quot;. Susan Silverman is Sunny Randall&#x27;s psychologist in &quot;Melancholy Baby&quot;.

The fictional Taft University, where Susan teaches, was also a primary setting for the Spenser novel &quot;Playmates&quot; and the non-Spenser novel &quot;Love and Glory&quot;.

<text>In North America, a sideshow is an extra, secondary production associated with a circus, carnival, fair, or other such attraction.

==Types==

There are four main types of classic sideshow attractions:

* The Ten-in-One offers a program of ten sequential acts under one tent for a single admission price. The ten-in-one might be partly a freak show exhibiting &quot;human oddities&quot; (including &quot;born freaks&quot; such as midgets, giants or persons with other deformities, or &quot;made freaks&quot; like tattooed people, fat people or &quot;human skeletons&quot;—extremely thin men often &quot;married&quot; to the fat lady, like Isaac W. Sprague). However, for variety&#x27;s sake, the acts in a ten-in-one would also include &quot;working acts&quot; who would perform magic tricks or daredevil stunts. In addition, the freak show performers might also perform acts or stunts, and would often sell souvenirs like &quot;giant&#x27;s rings&quot; or &quot;pitch cards&quot; with their photos and life stories. The ten-in-one would often end in a &quot;blowoff&quot; or &quot;ding,&quot; an extra act not advertised on the outside, which could be viewed for an additional fee. The blowoff act would be described provocatively, often as something deemed too strong for women and children, such as pickled punks.
* The Single-O is a single attraction, for example a single curiosity like the &quot;Bonnie and Clyde Death Car&quot; or Hitler&#x27;s staff car, a &quot;Giant Rat&quot; (actually usually a nutria) or other unusual animal, a &quot;What Is It?&quot; (often a convincing but artificial monstrosity like the Fiji Mermaid) or a geek show often billed as &quot;See the Victim of Drug Abuse.&quot;
* A Museum Show which might be deceptively billed as &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Freaks Past and Present,&quot; is a sideshow in which the exhibits are usually not alive. It might include tanks of piranhas or cages with unusual animals, stuffed freak animals or other exotic items like the weapons or cars allegedly used by famous murderers. Some of the exhibits might even be dummies or photographs of the billed attractions. It could still be truthfully billed with the claim &quot;$1,000 reward if not absolutely real—please do not touch or feed the animals on exhibit&quot;. The Single-O and the Museum Show are usually operated as &quot;grind shows,&quot; meaning that patrons may enter at any time, viewing the various exhibits at their leisure. 
* A Girl Show was sometimes offered in which women were the primary attraction. These could range from the revue (such as a &quot;Broadway Revue&quot;) with fully clothed performers to the racier &quot;kootch&quot; or &quot;hootchie-kootchie&quot; show (a strip show) which might play either partly clothed or &quot;strong&quot; (nude).

==Early history and acts==

By the 1830s, &quot;outside shows&quot; began to be established alongside travelling circuses. Initially, the circuses distanced themselves from the sideshows, but in 1850, a relationship was established between them.

&quot;Working acts&quot; often exhibited a number of stunts that could be counted on to draw crowds. These stunts used little-known methods and offered the elements of danger and excitement. Such acts included fire eating, sword swallowing, knife throwing, body piercing, lying on a bed of nails, walking up a ladder of sharp swords, and more. The renewed attention to these feats has prompted a new round of oversimplified or inaccurate explanations, leading some inexperienced people to attempt them without adequate training often resulting in injury and sometimes even death.

==Decline and revival==
Interest in sideshows declined as television made it easy (and free) to see the world&#x27;s most exotic attractions. Moreover, viewing &quot;human oddities&quot; became distasteful as the public conscience changed, and many localities passed laws forbidding the exhibition of freaks. The performers often protested (to no avail) that they had no objection to the sideshow, especially since it provided not only a good income for them, but in many cases it provided their only possible job. The sideshow seemed destined for oblivion, until only a few exemplars of the ten-in-one remained. In modern times, sideshow performers are often individual professionals or groups. A greater number of &quot;Single O&quot; attractions still tour carnivals.

In the 1940s, Ward Hall began the World of Wonders Amazement Show, which is still running today. It is the oldest carnival sideshow organization in America and is currently owned and run by Thomas Breen. 
In 1970, John Strong Jr (son of John Strong of The John Strong 3 Ring Tented Circus) began a 47-year continuous run of traveling sideshow, The Strong Sideshow. Several acts and artifacts toured over the years such as the 5-legged dog, Chupacabra, a 2-headed cow, and a mummy. John Jr. performed all the live acts himself for several years including sword swallowing, fire eating, bed of nails blade box and electric chair. After living the lifestyle for a lifetime, The Strong Sideshow is now in residency at &quot;The Sideshow Museum&quot;, in Uranus, Missouri.

In the early 1990s, Jim Rose developed a modern sideshow called &quot;the Jim Rose Circus&quot;, reinventing the sideshow with two types of acts that would attract modern audiences and stay within legal bounds. The show featured acts reviving traditional sideshow stunts and carrying some of them to extremes, and &quot;fringe&quot; artists (often exhibiting extreme body modification) performing bizarre or masochistic acts like eating insects, lifting weights by means of hooks inserted in their body piercings, or stapling currency to their forehead. The show drew audiences at venues unknown to old-time sideshows, like rock clubs and the 1992 Lollapalooza festival. The Jim Rose Circus held its last known performance in 2013 at The London Burlesque Festival. The impact of the Jim Rose Circus on pop culture inspired a new wave of performers. There are now more sideshow performers than at any other time in the genre&#x27;s history. At the same time in Canada, Scott McClelland, grandson of itinerant showman N.P. Lewchuk, formed Carnival Diablo, a show that performs frequently to this day. The success of these shows sparked a growing number of performers to revive the traditional sideshow arts, taught by sideshow veterans, and many now perform in spot engagements from rock clubs and comedy clubs to corporate events.

&quot;Sideshows by the Seashore&quot;, sponsored by Coney Island USA in Brooklyn, NY has performed since 1983, and tours under the name &quot;Coney Island Circus Sideshow&quot;. Circus historian and collector Ken Harck ran the Brothers Grim Sideshow, which toured with the OzzFest music festival in the summer of 2006 and 2007. Sideshow celebrity and multiple world record breaker Chayne Hultgren &#x27;The Space Cowboy&#x27; owns Australia&#x27;s largest traveling oddity museum &#x27;The Mutant Barnyard&#x27; and along with his partner Zoe Ellis &#x27;AKA: Zoe L&#x27;amore&#x27; they run &#x27;Sideshow Wonderland&#x27;, one of the world&#x27;s most successful sideshows described as a modern high energy human oddity exhibit or freakshow cabaret.

The Robin Marks Foundation is a nonprofit organization to elevate the image of sideshow, offer job opportunities for professionals, and continued education as well as to aid in educating the public about what it is to be part of the sideshow. The Southern Sideshow Hootenanny is another nonprofit organization dedicated to celebrating and fostering growth within the sideshow industry. Both have come about because of a revival in the art form and offer several benefits for members and patrons.

<doc id="26932" wikidata="Q8866" url="?curid=26932" title="Sagittarius (constellation)">
<text>Sagittariusis one of the constellations of the zodiac and is located in the Southern celestial hemisphere. It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy and remains one of the 88 modern constellations. Its old astronomical symbol is (♐︎). Its name is Latin for &quot;archer&quot;. Sagittarius is commonly represented as a centaur drawing a bow. It lies between Scorpius and Ophiuchus to the west and Capricornus and Microscopium to the east.

The center of the Milky Way lies in the westernmost part of Sagittarius (see Sagittarius A).

== Visualizations ==
As seen from the northern hemisphere, the constellation&#x27;s brighter stars form an easily recognizable asterism known as &quot;the Teapot&quot;. The stars δ Sgr (Kaus Media), ε Sgr (Kaus Australis), ζ Sgr (Ascella), and φ Sgr form the body of the pot; λ Sgr (Kaus Borealis) is the point of the lid; γ2 Sgr (Alnasl) is the tip of the spout; and σ Sgr (Nunki) and τ Sgr the handle. These same stars originally formed the bow and arrow of Sagittarius.

Marking the bottom of the teapot&#x27;s &quot;handle&quot; (or the shoulder area of the archer), is the bright star (2.59 magnitude) Zeta Sagittarii (ζ Sgr), named Ascella, and the fainter Tau Sagittarii (τ Sgr).

To complete the teapot metaphor, under dark skies a particularly dense area of the Milky Way (the Large Sagittarius Star Cloud) can be seen rising in a north-westerly arc above the spout, like a puff of steam rising from a boiling kettle.

The constellation as a whole is often depicted as having the rough appearance of a stick-figure archer drawing its bow, with the fainter stars providing the outline of the horse&#x27;s body. Sagittarius famously points its arrow at the heart of Scorpius, represented by the reddish star Antares, as the two constellations race around the sky. Following the direct line formed by Delta Sagittarii (δ Sgr) and Gamma2 Sagittarii (γ2 Sgr) leads nearly directly to Antares. Fittingly, Gamma2 Sagittarii is Alnasl, the Arabic word for &quot;arrowhead&quot;, and Delta Sagittarii is called Kaus Media, the &quot;center of the bow,&quot; from which the arrow protrudes. Kaus Media bisects Lambda Sagittarii (λ Sgr) and Epsilon Sagittarii (ε Sgr), whose names Kaus Borealis and Kaus Australis refer to the northern and southern portions of the bow, respectively.

Due to its astronomical interest and its status as a Zodiac constellation, Sagittarius is one of the best-known constellations and is considered a prominent feature of the summer skies in the northern hemisphere. However, at locations north of 43°N the constellation either drags along the southern horizon, or it does not rise at all. By contrast, in most of the southern hemisphere Sagittarius can appear overhead or nearly so. It is hidden behind the Sun&#x27;s glare from mid-November to mid-January and is the location of the Sun at the December solstice. By March, Sagittarius is rising at midnight. In June, it achieves opposition and can be seen all night. The June full moon appears in Sagittarius.

In classical antiquity, Capricorn was the location of the Sun at the December solstice, but due to the precession of the equinoxes, this had shifted to Sagittarius by the time of the Roman Empire. By approximately 2700 AD, the Sun will be in Scorpius at the December solstice.

== Notable features ==
=== Stars ===
α Sgr (Rukbat, meaning &quot;the archer&#x27;s knee&quot;) despite having the &quot;alpha&quot; designation, is not the brightest star of the constellation, having a magnitude of only 3.96. It is towards the bottom center of the map as shown. Instead, the brightest star is Epsilon Sagittarii (ε Sgr) (&quot;Kaus Australis,&quot; or &quot;southern part of the bow&quot;), at magnitude 1.85, or about seven times as bright as α Sgr.

Sigma Sagittarii (σ Sgr) (&quot;Nunki&quot;) is the constellation&#x27;s second-brightest star at magnitude 2.08. Nunki is a B2V star approximately 260 light-years away. &quot;Nunki&quot; is a Babylonian name of uncertain origin, but thought to represent the sacred Babylonian city of Eridu on the Euphrates, which would make Nunki the oldest star name currently in use.

Zeta Sagittarii (ζ Sgr) (&quot;Ascella&quot;), with apparent magnitude 2.61 of A2 spectra, is actually a double star whose two components have magnitudes 3.3 and 3.5.

Delta Sagittarii (δ Sgr) (&quot;Kaus Meridionalis&quot;), is a K2 spectra star with magnitude 2.71 about 350 light years from Earth.

Eta Sagittarii (η Sgr) is a double star with component magnitudes of 3.18 and 10, while Pi Sagittarii (π Sgr) (&quot;Albaldah&quot;) is actually a triple system whose components have magnitudes 3.7, 3.8, and 6.0.

The Bayer designation Beta Sagittarii (Beta Sgr, β Sagittarii, β Sgr) is shared by two star systems, β¹ Sagittarii, with apparent magnitude 3.96, and β² Sagittarii, magnitude 7.4. The two stars are separated by 0.36° in the sky and are 378 light-years from earth. Beta Sagittarii, located at a position associated with the forelegs of the centaur, has the traditional name &quot;Arkab&quot;, meaning &quot;Achilles tendon&quot;.

Nova Sagittarii 2015 No. 2 was discovered on 15 March 2015, by of Chatsworth Island, NSW, Australia. It lies near the center of the constellation. It reached a peak magnitude of 4.3 before steadily fading.

=== Deep-sky objects ===
The Milky Way is at its densest near Sagittarius, as this is where the Galactic Center lies. As a result, Sagittarius contains many star clusters and nebulae.

==== Star clouds ====
Sagittarius contains two well-known star clouds, both considered fine binocular objects.
* The Large Sagittarius Star Cloud is the brightest visible region of the Milky Way. It is a portion of the central bulge of the galaxy seen around the thick dust of the Great Rift, and is the innermost galactic structure that can be observed in visible wavelengths. It has several embedded clusters and superimposed dark nebulae.
* The Small Sagittarius Star Cloud, also known as Messier 24, has an apparent magnitude of 2.5. The cloud fills a space of significant volume to a depth of 10,000 to 16,000 light-years. Embedded in M24 is NGC 6603, a small star cluster that is very dense. NGC 6567, a dim planetary nebula, and Barnard 92, a Bok globule, are also nearby.

==== Nebulae ====
Sagittarius contains several well-known nebulae, including the Lagoon Nebula (Messier 8), near λ Sagittarii; the Omega Nebula (Messier 17), near the border with Scutum; and the Trifid Nebula (Messier 20), a large nebula containing some very young, hot stars.
* The Lagoon Nebula (M8) is an emission nebula that is located 5,000 light-years from Earth and measures 140 light-years by 60 light-years (1.5°). Though it appears grey in telescopes to the unaided eye, long-exposure photographs reveal its pink hue, common to emission nebulae. It is fairly bright, with an integrated magnitude of 3.0. The Lagoon Nebula was discovered independently by John Flamsteed in 1680, Guillaume Le Gentil in 1747, and Charles Messier in 1764. The central area of the Lagoon Nebula is also known as the Hourglass Nebula, so named for its distinctive shape. The Hourglass Nebula has its shape because of matter propelled by Herschel 36. The Lagoon Nebula also features three dark nebulae listed in the Barnard Catalogue. The Lagoon Nebula was instrumental in the discovery of Bok globules, as Bart Bok studied prints of the nebula intensively in 1947. Approximately 17,000 Bok globules were discovered in the nebula nine years later as a part of the Palomar Sky Survey; studies later showed that Bok&#x27;s hypothesis that the globules held protostars was correct.
* The Omega Nebula is a fairly bright nebula, sometimes called the Horseshoe Nebula or Swan Nebula. It has an integrated magnitude of 6.0 and is 4890 light-years from Earth. It was discovered in 1746 by Philippe Loys de Chésaux; observers since him have differed greatly in how they view the nebula, hence its myriad of names. Most often viewed as a checkmark, it was seen as a swan by George F. Chambers in 1889, a loon by Roy Bishop, and as a curl of smoke by Camille Flammarion.
* The Trifid Nebula (M20, NGC 6514) is an emission nebula in Sagittarius that lies less than two degrees from the Lagoon Nebula. Discovered by French comet-hunter Charles Messier, it is located between 2,000 and 9,000 light-years from Earth and has a diameter of approximately 50 light-years. The outside of the Trifid Nebula is a bluish reflection nebula; the interior is pink with two dark bands that divide it into three areas, sometimes called &quot;lobes&quot;. Hydrogen in the nebula is ionized, creating its characteristic color, by a central triple star, which formed in the intersection of the two dark bands. M20 is associated with a cluster that has a magnitude of 6.3.
* The Red Spider Nebula (NGC 6537) is a planetary nebula located at a distance of about 4000 light-years from Earth.
* NGC 6559 is a star-forming region located at a distance of about 5000 light-years from Earth, in the constellation of Sagittarius, showing both emission (red) and reflection (blue) regions.

In addition, several other nebulae have been located within Sagittarius and are of interest to astronomy.
* NGC 6445 is a planetary nebula with an approximate magnitude of 11. A large nebula at over one arcminute in diameter, it appears very close to the globular cluster NGC 6440.
* NGC 6638 is a dimmer globular at magnitude 9.2, though it is more distant than M71 at a distance of 26,000 light-years. It is a Shapley class VI cluster; the classification means that it has an intermediate concentration at its core. It is approximately a degree away from the brighter globulars M22 and M28; NGC 6638 is southeast and southwest of the clusters respectively.

==== Other deep sky objects ====
In 1999 a violent outburst at V4641 Sgr was thought to have revealed the location of the closest known black hole to Earth, but later investigation increased its estimated distance by a factor of 15. The complex radio source Sagittarius A is also in Sagittarius, near its western boundary with Ophiuchus. Astronomers believe that one of its components, known as Sagittarius A*, is associated with a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy, with a mass of 2.6 million solar masses. Although not visible to the naked eye, Sagittarius A* is located off the top of the spout of the Teapot asterism. The Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy is located just outside the Milky Way.

Baade&#x27;s Window is an area with very little obscuring dust that shows objects closer to the Milky Way&#x27;s center than would normally be visible. NGC 6522, magnitude 8.6, and NGC 6528, magnitude 9.5, are both globular clusters visible through Baade&#x27;s Window. 20,000 and 24,000 light-years from Earth, with Shapley classes of VI and V respectively, both are moderately concentrated at their cores. NGC 6528 is closer to the galactic core at an approximate distance of 2,000 light-years.

2MASS-GC02, also known as Hurt 2, is a globular cluster at a distance of about 16 thousand light-years from Earth. It was discovered in 2000 by Joselino Vasquez, and confirmed by a team of astronomers under the leadership of R. J. Hurt at 2MASS.

== Exploration ==
The space probe New Horizons is moving on a trajectory out of the Solar System as of 2016 that places the probe in front of Sagittarius as seen from the Earth. New Horizons will exhaust its radioisotope thermoelectric generator long before it reaches any other stars.

The Wow! signal was a strong narrowband radio signal that appeared to have come from the direction of Sagittarius.

== Mythology ==

The Babylonians identified Sagittarius as the god Nergal, a centaur-like creature firing an arrow from a bow. It is generally depicted with wings, with two heads, one panther head and one human head, as well as a scorpion&#x27;s stinger raised above its more conventional horse&#x27;s tail. The Sumerian name Pabilsag is composed of two elements – Pabil, meaning &#x27;elder paternal kinsman&#x27; and Sag, meaning &#x27;chief, head&#x27;. The name may thus be translated as the &#x27;Forefather&#x27; or &#x27;Chief Ancestor&#x27;. The figure is reminiscent of modern depictions of Sagittarius.

=== Greek mythology ===
In Greek mythology, Sagittarius is usually identified as a centaur: half human, half horse. However, perhaps due to the Greeks&#x27; adoption of the Sumerian constellation, some confusion surrounds the identity of the archer. Some identify Sagittarius as the centaur Chiron, the son of Philyra and Cronus, who was said to have changed himself into a horse to escape his jealous wife, Rhea, and tutor to Jason. As there are two centaurs in the sky, some identify Chiron with the other constellation, known as Centaurus. Or, as an alternative tradition holds, that Chiron devised the constellations Sagittarius and Centaurus to help guide the Argonauts in their quest for the Golden Fleece.

A competing mythological tradition, as espoused by Eratosthenes, identified the Archer not as a centaur but as the satyr Crotus, son of Pan, who Greeks credited with the invention of archery. According to myth, Crotus often went hunting on horseback and lived among the Muses, who requested that Zeus place him in the sky, where he is seen demonstrating archery.

The arrow of this constellation points towards the star Antares, the &quot;heart of the scorpion&quot;, and Sagittarius stands poised to attack should Scorpius ever attack the nearby Hercules, or to avenge Scorpius&#x27;s slaying of Orion.

=== Terebellum ===

On the west side of the constellation, Ptolemy also described the asterism Terebellum consisting of four 4th magnitude stars, including the closest and fastest moving member, Omega Sagittarii.

=== Astrology ===
, the Sun appears in the constellation Sagittarius from 18 December to 18 January. In tropical astrology, the Sun is considered to be in the sign Sagittarius from 22 November to 21 December, and in sidereal astrology, from 16 December to 14 January.

<text>Scorpius is a zodiac constellation located in the Southern celestial hemisphere, where it sits near the center of the Milky Way, between Libra to the west and Sagittarius to the east. Scorpius is an ancient constellation whose recognition predates Greek culture; it is one of the 48 constellations identified by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the second century.

==Notable features==

===Stars===
Scorpius contains many bright stars, including Antares (α Sco), &quot;rival of Mars,&quot; so named because of its distinct reddish hue; β1 Sco (Graffias or Acrab), a triple star; δ Sco (Dschubba, &quot;the forehead&quot;); θ Sco (Sargas, of sumerian origin); ν Sco (Jabbah); ξ Sco; π Sco (Fang); σ Sco (Alniyat); and τ Sco (Paikauhale).

Marking the tip of the scorpion&#x27;s curved tail are λ Sco (Shaula) and υ Sco (Lesath), whose names both mean &quot;sting.&quot; Given their proximity to one another, λ Sco and υ Sco are sometimes referred to as the Cat&#x27;s Eyes.

The constellation&#x27;s bright stars form a pattern like a longshoreman&#x27;s hook. Most of them are massive members of the nearest OB association: Scorpius–Centaurus.

The star δ Sco, after having been a stable 2.3 magnitude star, flared in July 2000 to 1.9 in a matter of weeks. It has since become a variable star fluctuating between 2.0 and 1.6. This means that at its brightest it is the second brightest star in Scorpius.

U Scorpii is the fastest known nova, with a period of about 10 years.

AH Scorpii is a red supergiant star and one of the largest known stars, being 1,400 times larger than the Sun. It is also a luminous star, 340,000 times brighter than the Sun, altought is too faint to be seen to the naked eye, with a brightness varying from 6.5 to 9.6.

The close pair of stars ω1 Scorpii and ω² Scorpii are an optical double, which can be resolved by the unaided eye. One is a yellow giant, while the other is a blue B-type star in the Scorpius-Centaurus Association.

The star once designated γ Sco (despite being well within the boundaries of Libra) is today known as σ Lib. Moreover, the entire constellation of Libra was considered to be claws of Scorpius (&quot;Chelae Scorpionis&quot;) in Ancient Greek times, with a set of scales held aloft by Astraea (represented by adjacent Virgo) being formed from these westernmost stars during later Greek times. The division into Libra was formalised during Ancient Greek or Roman times.

===Deep-sky objects===

Due to its location straddling the Milky Way, this constellation contains many deep-sky objects such as the open clusters Messier 6 (the Butterfly Cluster) and Messier 7 (the Ptolemy Cluster), NGC 6231 (by ζ² Sco), and the globular clusters Messier 4 and Messier 80.

Messier 80 (NGC 6093) is a globular cluster of magnitude 7.3, 33,000 light-years from Earth. It is a compact Shapley class II cluster; the classification indicates that it is highly concentrated and dense at its nucleus. M80 was discovered in 1781 by Charles Messier. It was the site of a rare discovery in 1860 when Arthur von Auwers discovered the nova T Scorpii.

NGC 6302, also called the Bug Nebula, is a bipolar planetary nebula. NGC 6334, also known as the Cat&#x27;s Paw Nebula, is an emission nebula and star-forming region.

==Mythology==
In Greek mythology, several myths associated with Scorpius attribute it to Orion. According to one version, Orion boasted to the goddess Artemis and her mother, Leto, that he would kill every animal on Earth. Artemis and Leto sent a scorpion to kill Orion. Their battle caught the attention of Zeus, who raised both combatants to the sky to serve as a reminder for mortals to curb their excessive pride. In another version of the myth, Artemis&#x27; twin brother, Apollo, was the one who sent the scorpion to kill Orion after the hunter earned the goddess&#x27; favor by admitting she was better than him. After Zeus raised Orion and the scorpion to the sky, the former hunts every winter but flees every summer when the scorpion comes. In both versions, Artemis asked Zeus to raise Orion.

In a Greek myth without Orion, the celestial scorpion encountered Phaethon while he was driving his father Helios&#x27; Sun Chariot.

===Origins===
The Babylonians called this constellation MUL.GIR.TAB - the &#x27;Scorpion&#x27;; the signs can be literally read as &#x27;the (creature with) a burning sting&#x27;.

In some old descriptions the constellation of Libra is treated as the Scorpion&#x27;s claws. Libra was known as the Claws of the Scorpion in Babylonian (&quot;zibānītu&quot; (compare Arabic &quot;zubānā&quot;)) and in Greek (χηλαι).

===Astrology===

The Western astrological sign Scorpio differs from the astronomical constellation. Astronomically, the Sun is in Scorpius&#x27;s IAU boundaries for just six days, from November 23 to November 28. Much of the difference is due to the constellation Ophiuchus, which is used by few astrologers. Scorpius corresponds to the Hindu nakshatras Anuradha, Jyeshtha, and Mula.

==Culture==
*The Javanese people of Indonesia call this constellation &quot;Banyakangrem&quot; (&quot;the brooded swan&quot;) or &quot;Kalapa Doyong&quot; (&quot;leaning coconut tree&quot;) due to the shape similarity.
*In Hawaii, Scorpius is known as the demigod Maui&#x27;s Fishhook or &quot;Ka Makau Nui o Māui&quot; (meaning &quot;the Big Fishhook of Māui&quot;) and the name of the fishhook was &quot;Manaiakalani&quot;.
*Scorpius was divided into two asterisms which were used by Bugis sailors for navigation. The northern part of Scorpius (α, β, γ or σ Lib, δ, ε, ζ, μ, σ and τ Scorpii) was called &quot;bintoéng lambarué&quot;, meaning &quot;skate stars&quot;. The southern part of Scorpius (η, θ, ι, κ, λ and ν Scorpii) was called &quot;bintoéng balé mangngiwéng&quot;, meaning &quot;shark stars&quot;.

<doc id="26940" wikidata="Q8877" url="?curid=26940" title="Steven Spielberg">
<text>Steven Allan Spielberg ( ; born December 18, 1946) is an American filmmaker. A major figure of the New Hollywood era and pioneer of the modern blockbuster, Spielberg is widely regarded as one of the greatest film directors of all time and is the most commercially successful director in film history. Among other accolades, he has received three Academy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards and two BAFTA Awards, as well as the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1995, the Knight Commander of the British Empire in 2001, the Kennedy Center Honor in 2006, the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2009 and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2015. Seven of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Spielberg was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, and grew up in Phoenix, Arizona. He moved to California and studied film in college. After directing several episodes for television, including &quot;Night Gallery&quot; and &quot;Columbo&quot;, he directed the television film &quot;Duel&quot; (1971). He made his theatrical debut with &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot; (1974) and became a household name with the summer blockbuster &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975). He directed more escapist box office successes with &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977), &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982) and the original &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; trilogy (1981–1989). He explored drama in &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (1985) and &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; (1987).

In 1993, Spielberg directed the science fiction thriller &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, the highest-grossing film ever at the time, and the Holocaust drama &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, which has often been listed as one of the greatest films ever made. He won the Academy Award for Best Director for the latter as well as for the World War II epic &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998). Spielberg has since directed the science fiction films &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; (2001), &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002), and &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; (2005); the historical dramas &quot;Amistad&quot; (1997), &quot;Munich&quot; (2005), &quot;War Horse&quot; (2011), &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2012), &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Post&quot; (2017); the comedy &quot;The Terminal&quot; (2004); the animated film &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (2011); the musical &quot;West Side Story&quot; (2021); and the semi-autobiographical drama &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; (2022).

Spielberg co-founded Amblin Entertainment and DreamWorks, and he has served as a producer for many successful films and television series, among them &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (1982), &quot;Gremlins&quot; (1984), &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985), &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988) and &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; (2001). He has had a long collaboration with the composer John Williams, with whom he has worked for all but five of his feature films. Several of Spielberg&#x27;s works are considered among the greatest films in history, and some are among the highest-grossing films ever. In 2013, &quot;Time&quot; listed him as one of the 100 most influential people, and in 2023, Spielberg was the recipient of the first ever &quot;Time&quot; 100 Impact Award in the US.

==Early life and background==
Spielberg was born on December 18, 1946, in Cincinnati, Ohio. His mother, Leah (, later Adler), was a concert pianist and ran a kosher dairy restaurant, and his father, Arnold, was an electrical engineer involved in the development of computers. His immediate family were Reform Jewish/Orthodox Jewish. Spielberg&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Jews from Ukraine; his grandmother Rebecca (), was from Sudylkiv, and his grandfather Shmuel Spielberg was from Kamianets-Podilskyi. Spielberg has three younger sisters: Anne, Sue, and Nancy. At their home in Cincinnati, his grandmother taught English to Holocaust survivors. They, in turn, taught him numbers: One man in particular, I kept looking at his numbers–his number tattooed on his forearm ... he started – you know, when–during the dinner break, when everybody was eating and not learning, he would point to the numbers. And he would say, that is a two, and that is a four. And then he&#x27;d say, and this is a eight, and that&#x27;s a one. And I&#x27;ll never forget this. And he said, and that&#x27;s a nine. And then he crooked his arm and inverted his arm and said, and see, it becomes a six. It&#x27;s magic. And now it&#x27;s a nine, and now it&#x27;s a six, and now it&#x27;s a nine and now it&#x27;s a six. And that&#x27;s really how I learned my numbers for the first time ... the irony of all that, and the gift of that lesson, never really dawned on me until I was much older.

In 1952, his family moved to Haddon Township, New Jersey, after his father was hired by RCA. Spielberg attended Hebrew school from 1953 to 1957, in classes taught by Rabbi Albert L. Lewis. In early 1957, the family moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Spielberg had a bar mitzvah ceremony when he was thirteen. His family was involved in the synagogue and had many Jewish friends. Of the Holocaust, he said that his parents &quot;talked about it all the time, and so it was always on my mind&quot;. His father had lost between sixteen and twenty relatives in the Holocaust. Spielberg found it difficult accepting his heritage; he said: &quot;It isn&#x27;t something I enjoy admitting... but when I was seven, eight, nine years old, God forgive me, I was embarrassed because we were Orthodox Jews. I was embarrassed by the outward perception of my parents&#x27; Jewish practices. I was never really ashamed to be Jewish, but I was uneasy at times.&quot; Spielberg was the target of anti-Semitism: &quot;In high school, I got smacked and kicked around. Two bloody noses. It was horrible.&quot; He gradually followed Judaism less during adolescence, after his family had moved to various neighborhoods and found themselves to be the only Jews.

He recalls his parents taking him to see Cecil B. DeMille&#x27;s &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot; (1952). He had never seen a movie before, and thought they were taking him to the circus. He was terrified by the movie&#x27;s train crash, and at age 12, he recreated it with his Lionel trains and filmed it. He recalls: &quot;The trains went around and around, and after a while that got boring, and I had this eight-millimeter camera, and I staged a train wreck and filmed it. That was hard on the trains, but then I could cut the film lots of different ways and look at it over and over again.&quot; This was his first home movie. In 1958, he became a Boy Scout, eventually attaining the rank of Eagle Scout. He fulfilled a requirement for the photography merit badge by making a nine-minute 8 mm Western, &quot;The Last Gunfight&quot;. Spielberg used his father&#x27;s movie camera to make amateur features, and began taking the camera along on every Scout trip. At age 13, Spielberg made a 40-minute war film, &quot;Escape to Nowhere&quot;, with a cast of classmates. The film won first prize in a statewide competition. Throughout his early teens, and after entering high school, Spielberg made about fifteen to twenty 8 mm adventure films. He recalls that my dad told me stories about World War II constantly... I knew, based on the stories my dad and his friends were telling about World War II, that there was no glory in war. And it was ugly, and it was cruel ... it was, you know, visually devastating. And so I thought, someday, if I ever do make a war movie for real, it&#x27;s got to be something that tells the truth about what those experiences had been for those young 17-, 18-, 19-year-old boys storming Omaha Beach, let&#x27;s say.

In Phoenix, Spielberg went to the local theater every Saturday. Formative films included Victor Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Captains Courageous&quot; (1937), Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot; (both 1940), Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Rashomon&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Seven Samurai&quot; (1954), Ishirō Honda&#x27;s &quot;Godzilla, King of the Monsters!&quot; (1956), David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; (1957) and &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962) (&quot;the film that set me on my journey&quot;), Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Birds&quot; (1963) and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964) and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) (&quot;I&#x27;m still living off the adrenalin that... I experienced watching that film for the first time.&quot;) He attended Arcadia High School in 1961 for three years. In 1963, he wrote and directed a 140-minute science fiction film, &quot;Firelight&quot;, the basis of &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. &quot;Firelight&quot;, funded mainly by his father, was shown in a local theater for one evening and grossed $501 against its $500 budget.

After taking a tour bus to Universal Studios, a chance conversation with an executive led to Spielberg getting a three-day pass to the premises. On the fourth day, he walked up to the studio gates without a pass, and the security guard waved him in: &quot;I basically spent the next two months at Universal Studios ... that was how I became an unofficial apprentice that summer.&quot; His family later moved to Saratoga, California, where he attended Saratoga High School. A year later, his parents divorced. Spielberg moved to Los Angeles to stay with his father, while his three sisters and mother remained in Saratoga. He recalls: My parents split up when I was 15 or 16 years old, and I needed a special friend, and had to use my imagination to take me to places that felt good – that helped me move beyond the problems my parents were having, and that ended our family as a whole. And thinking about that time, I thought, an extraterrestrial character would be the perfect springboard to purge the pain of your parents&#x27; splitting up. He recalls his mother had &quot;a huge adventurous personality. We always saw her as Peter Pan, the kid who never wanted to grow up, and she sort of saw herself that way. I think my mom lived a lot of childhoods in her ninety-seven years.&quot; He was not interested in academics, aspiring only to be a filmmaker. He applied to the University of Southern California&#x27;s film school but was turned down because of his mediocre grades. He then applied and enrolled at California State University, Long Beach, where he became a brother of Theta Chi fraternity. In 1968, Universal gave Spielberg the opportunity to write and direct a short film for theatrical release, the 26-minute 35 mm &quot;Amblin&#x27;&quot;. Studio vice president Sidney Sheinberg was impressed and offered Spielberg a seven-year directing contract. A year later, he dropped out of college to begin directing television productions for Universal, making him the youngest director to be signed to a long-term plan with a major Hollywood studio. Spielberg returned to Long Beach in 2002, where he presented &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; to complete his Bachelor of Arts in Film and Electronic Media.

He recalls a formative encounter with one of his favorite filmmakers, John Ford, who said: &quot;So they tell me you want to be a picture maker. You see those paintings around the office?&quot; Spielberg said he did. Ford pointed to a painting and asked, &quot;Where&#x27;s the horizon?&quot; Spielberg said it was at the top. Ford asked him where it was in another painting. Spielberg said it was at the bottom. Ford said, &quot;When you&#x27;re able to distinguish the art of the horizon at the bottom of a frame or at the top of the frame, but not going right through the center of the frame, when you can appreciate why it&#x27;s at the top and why it&#x27;s at the bottom, you might make a pretty good picture maker.&quot;

==Career==
===1969–1974: On the horizon ===
Spielberg made his professional debut with &quot;Eyes&quot;, a segment of &quot;Night Gallery&quot; (1969) scripted by Rod Serling and starring Joan Crawford. Initially, there was skepticism from Crawford and studio executives regarding Spielberg&#x27;s inexperience. Despite Spielberg&#x27;s efforts to implement advanced camerawork techniques, studio executives demanded a more straightforward approach. His initial contributions received mixed responses, leading Spielberg to briefly step back from studio work. Crawford, reflecting on her collaboration with Spielberg, recognized his potential, noting his unique intuitive inspiration. She expressed her appreciation for Spielberg&#x27;s talent in a note to him and also communicated her approval to Serling. Crawford&#x27;s endorsement highlighted Spielberg&#x27;s early recognition in Hollywood despite initial hesitations regarding his experience.

In the early 1970s, Spielberg unsuccessfully tried to raise financing for his own low-budget films. He co-wrote and directed teleplays for &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;The Name of the Game&quot;, &quot;Columbo, Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law&quot; and &quot;The Psychiatrist.&quot; Although unsatisfied with his work, Spielberg used the opportunity to experiment with his techniques and learn about filmmaking. He earned good reviews and impressed producers; he was earning a steady income and relocated to Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles.&quot;&quot;

Impressed, Universal signed Spielberg to do four television films. The first was &quot;Duel&quot; (1971), adapted from Richard Matheson&#x27;s short story of the same name, about a salesman (Dennis Weaver) being chased down a highway by a psychotic tanker truck driver. Impressed, executives decided to promote the film on television. Reviews were positive, and Universal asked Spielberg to shoot more scenes so that &quot;Duel&quot; could be released theatrically to international markets.&quot;&quot; &quot;Deservedly so&quot; writes David Thomson, &quot;for it stands up as one of the medium&#x27;s most compelling spirals of suspense. The ordinariness of the Dennis Weaver character and the monstrous malignance of the truck confront one another with a narrative assurance that never needs to remind us of the element of fable.&quot; More TV films followed: &quot;Something Evil&quot; (1972) and &quot;Savage&quot; (1973).

Spielberg made his theatrical debut with &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot; (1974), based on a true story about a married couple on the run, desperate to regain custody of their baby from foster parents.&quot;&quot; The film starred Goldie Hawn and William Atherton and marked the first of many collaborations with the composer John Williams. Although the film was awarded Best Screenplay at the 1974 Cannes Film Festival, it was not a commercial success, which Spielberg blamed on Universal&#x27;s inconsistent marketing. The film opened in four hundred theaters in the US to positive reviews; Pauline Kael wrote &quot;Spielberg uses his gifts in a very free-and-easy, American way—for humor, and for a physical response to action. He could be that rarity among directors, a born entertainer—perhaps a new generation&#x27;s Howard Hawks.&quot; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that &quot;a major new director is on the horizon&quot;.

=== 1975–1980: Magician ===
Producers Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown took a chance with Spielberg, giving him the opportunity to direct &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975), a thriller based on Peter Benchley&#x27;s bestseller. In it, a great white shark attacks beachgoers at a summer resort town, prompting police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) to hunt it down with the help of a marine biologist (Richard Dreyfuss) and a veteran shark hunter (Robert Shaw). &quot;Jaws&quot; was the first movie shot on open ocean, so shooting proved difficult, especially when the mechanical shark malfunctioned. The shooting schedule overran by a hundred days, and Universal threatened to cancel production. Against expectations, &quot;Jaws&quot; was a success, setting the domestic box office record and making Spielberg a household name. It won Academy Awards for Best Film Editing (Verna Fields), Best Original Dramatic Score (John Williams) and Best Sound (Robert Hoyt, Roger Heman, Earl Madery and John Carter). Spielberg said the malfunctioning of the mechanical shark resulted in a better movie, as he had to find other ways to suggest the shark&#x27;s presence. After seeing the unconventional camera techniques of &quot;Jaws&quot;, Alfred Hitchcock praised &quot;young Spielberg&quot; for thinking outside the visual dynamics of the theater: &quot;He&#x27;s the first one of us who doesn&#x27;t see the proscenium arch&quot;.

After declining an offer to make &quot;Jaws 2&quot;, Spielberg and Dreyfuss reunited to work on a film about UFOs, &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977). Spielberg used 65 mm film for the best picture quality, and a new live-action recording system so that the recordings could be duplicated later. He cast one of his favorite directors, François Truffaut, as the scientist Claude Lacombe and worked with special effects expert Douglas Trumbull. It marked the first of many collaborations between Spielberg and editor Michael Kahn. One of the rare films both written and directed by Spielberg, &quot;Close Encounters&quot; was very popular with filmgoers&quot;&quot; and won Academy Awards for Best Cinematography (Vilmos Zsigmond) and Best Sound Effects Editing (Frank Warner). Stanley Kauffmann wrote: &quot;I saw &quot;Close Encounters&quot; at its first public showing in New York, and most of the audience stayed on and on to watch the credits crawl lengthily at the end. For one thing, under the credits the giant spaceship was returning to the stars. For another, they just didn&#x27;t want to leave this picture. For still another, they seemed to understand the importance of those many names to what they had just seen.&quot; Kauffmann placed it first on his list of the best American films from 1968 to 1977. Reviewing &quot;Close Encounters&quot;, Kael called Spielberg &quot;a magician in the age of movies&quot;.

His next directorial work was &quot;1941&quot; (1979), an action-comedy written by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale about Californians preparing for a Japanese invasion after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Spielberg was self-conscious about doing comedy as he had no prior experience in the genre. Universal and Columbia agreed to co-finance the film. &quot;1941&quot; grossed more than $92.4 million worldwide upon release, but most critics, and the studio heads, disliked it. Charles Champlin described &quot;1941&quot; as &quot;the most conspicuous waste since the last major oil spill, which it somewhat resembles&quot;.

=== 1981–1992: Impresario ===
Spielberg directed &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), with a screenplay by Lawrence Kasdan based on a story by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman. They considered it an homage to the serials of the 1930s and 1940s.&quot; It starred Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones and Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood. Filmed in La Rochelle, Hawaii, Tunisia and Elstree Studios, England, the shoot was difficult but Spielberg said that it helped him hone his business acumen. The film was a box office success and won Academy Awards for Best Art Direction (Norman Reynolds, Leslie Dilley and Michael D. Ford); Best Film Editing (Michael Kahn); Best Sound (Bill Varney, Steve Maslow, Gregg Landaker and Roy Charman); Best Sound Editing (Ben Burtt and Richard L. Anderson); and Best Visual Effects (Richard Edlund, Kit West, Bruce Nicholson and Joe Johnston). Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; is an out-of-body experience, a movie of glorious imagination and breakneck speed that grabs you in the first shot, hurtles you through a series of incredible adventures, and deposits you back in reality two hours later–breathless, dizzy, wrung-out, and with a silly grin on your face&quot;. &quot;Raiders&quot; was the first film in the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; franchise.
Spielberg returned to science fiction with &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982). It tells the story of Elliot (Henry Thomas), a young boy who befriends an alien who was accidentally left behind by his companions and is attempting to return home. Spielberg eschewed storyboards so that his direction would be more spontaneous, and shot roughly in sequence so that the actors&#x27; performances would be authentic as they bonded with and said goodbye to E.T. Richard Corliss wrote, &quot;This was the closing-night attraction at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival, a venue not known for blubbering sentiment. At the end, as the little critter bade his farewells and the Jules Verne-like space ship left the ground, the audience similarly levitated. One heard the audience&#x27;s childlike applause; one felt their spirits lift. This was rapture made audible, palpable ... Spielberg orchestrated the movements of the camera and the puppet spaceman with the feelings of—it has to be called love—expressed in young Henry Thomas&#x27; yearning face. E.T. was the first film character to be a finalist in TIME&#x27;s Man of the Year sweepstakes. It would have been fine with me if the little creature, this lovely film, had won.&quot;

A special screening was organized for Ronald and Nancy Reagan, who were emotional by the end. &quot;E.T.&quot; grossed $700 million worldwide. It won four Academy Awards: Best Original Score (John Williams), Best Sound (Robert Knudson, Robert Glass, Don Digirolamo and Gene Cantamessa), Best Sound Editing (Charles L. Campbell and Ben Burtt) and Best Visual Effects (Carlo Rambaldi, Dennis Muren and Kenneth F. Smith). Kael wrote of E.T., &quot;His voice is ancient and otherworldly but friendly, humorous. And this scaly, wrinkled little man with huge, wide-apart, soulful eyes and a jack-in-the-box neck has been so fully created that he&#x27;s a friend to us, too; when he speaks of his longing to go home the audience becomes as mournful as Elliot. Spielberg has earned the tears that some people in the audience—and not just children—shed. Genuinely entrancing movies are almost as rare as extraterrestrial visitors.&quot; Spielberg co-wrote and produced &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (Tobe Hooper, 1982), released the same summer as &quot;E.T.&quot; With John Landis, he co-produced the anthology film &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; (1983), contributing the &quot;Kick the Can&quot; segment.
His next feature film was the &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; prequel &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984). Working again with Lucas and Ford, the film was shot in the United States, Sri Lanka and China. The film was darker than its predecessor, and led to the creation of the PG-13 rating because some content was deemed unsuitable for children under 13. Spielberg later said that he was unhappy with &quot;Temple of Doom&quot; because it lacked his &quot;personal touches and love&quot;. Nonetheless, the film was a blockbuster hit, won the Academy Award for Best Special Effects and received mostly good reviews. Kael preferred it to the original, writing, &quot;Spielberg is like a magician whose tricks are so daring they make you laugh. He creates an atmosphere of happy disbelief: the more breathtaking and exhilarating the stunts are the funnier they are. Nobody has ever fused thrills and laughter in quite the way that he does here. He starts off at full charge in the opening sequence and just keeps going&quot;. She conceded that it was less &quot;sincere&quot; than &quot;Raiders&quot;, adding &quot;that&#x27;s what is so good about it.&quot; On this project Spielberg met his future wife, Kate Capshaw, who played Willie Scott. Spielberg recalled, &quot;The second film I could have done a lot better if there had been a different story. It was a good learning exercise for me to really throw myself into a black hole. I came out of the darkness of &quot;Temple Of Doom&quot; and I entered the light of the woman I was eventually going to marry and raise a family with.&quot;

Thomson writes that &quot;At first sight, the Spielberg of the eighties may seem more an impresario—or a studio, even—then a director.&quot; Between 1984 and 1990, Spielberg served as producer or executive producer on nineteen feature films for his production company, Amblin Entertainment. Among them were &quot;Gremlins&quot; (Joe Dante, 1984), &quot;The Goonies&quot; (Richard Donner, 1985), &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (Robert Zemeckis, 1985), &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (Zemeckis, 1988), &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; (John Patrick Shanley, 1990) and &quot;Arachnophobia&quot; (Frank Marshall, 1990).&quot;&quot; In the early 1980s, Spielberg befriended Warner Communications CEO Steve Ross eventually resulting in Spielberg making films for Warner Bros. It began with &quot;The Color Purple&quot; (1985), an adaptation of Alice Walker&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, about a generation of empowered African-American women in the depression-era South. It was Spielberg&#x27;s first film on a dramatic subject matter, and he expressed reservations about tackling the project: &quot;It&#x27;s the risk of being judged-and accused of not having the sensibility to do character studies.&quot; Starring Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey, the film was a box office hit and critics started to take note of Spielberg&#x27;s foray into drama. Ebert named it the best film of the year. The film also received eleven Academy Award nominations, and Spielberg won Best Director from the Directors Guild of America. The film was produced and scored by Quincy Jones.

As China underwent economic reform and opened up to the American film industry, Spielberg made &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; (1987), the first American film shot in Shanghai since the 1930s. It is an adaptation of J. G. Ballard&#x27;s autobiographical novel about Jamie Graham (Christian Bale), a young boy who goes from being the son of a wealthy British family in Shanghai to a prisoner of war in a Japanese internment camp during World War II. David Lean was originally set to direct, with Spielberg producing. It was written by playwright Tom Stoppard and co-starred John Malkovich as an American expatriate. Critical reaction was mixed at the time of release; criticism ranged from the &quot;overwrought&quot; plot to Spielberg&#x27;s downplaying of &quot;disease and starvation&quot;. However, Andrew Sarris named it the best film of the year and later included it among the best of the decade. The film was nominated for six Academy Awards, but was a disappointment at the box office; Ian Alterman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought it was overlooked by audiences. Spielberg recalled that &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; was one of his most enjoyable films to make. Thomson called it &quot;a great work through and through&quot; and &quot;the first clear sign that Spielberg the showman was an artist, too.&quot;
In 1989, Spielberg intended to direct &quot;Rain Man&quot;, but instead directed &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; to meet his contractual obligations. Producer Lucas and star Ford returned for the film. A longtime James Bond fan, Spielberg cast Sean Connery as Jones&#x27;s father, Henry Jones, Sr. Due to complaints about violence in &quot;Temple of Doom&quot;, Spielberg returned to more family-friendly fare for the third installment. &quot;Last Crusade&quot; received mostly positive reviews and was a box office success, earning $474 million; it was his biggest hit since &quot;E.T.&quot; Biographer Joseph McBride wrote that it was a comeback for Spielberg, and Spielberg acknowledged the amount he has learned from making the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series.&quot;&quot; Ebert wrote that, &quot;If there is just a shade of disappointment after seeing this movie, it has to be because we will never again have the shock of this material seeming new. &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, now more than ever, seems a turning point in the cinema of escapist entertainment, and there was really no way Spielberg could make it new all over again. What he has done is to take many of the same elements, and apply all of his craft and sense of fun to make them work yet once again. And they do.

Also in 1989, he reunited with Richard Dreyfuss for the romantic drama &quot;Always&quot;, about an aerial firefighter. It is a modern remake of one of Spielberg&#x27;s favorite childhood films, &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot; (1943). The story was personal; he said &quot;As a child I was very frustrated, and maybe I saw my own parents [in &quot;A Guy Named Joe&quot;]. I was also short of girlfriends. And it stuck with me.&quot;&quot;&quot; Spielberg had discussed the film with Dreyfuss back in 1975, with up to twelve drafts being written before filming commenced. &quot;Always&quot; was commercially unsuccessful and received mixed reviews. Janet Maslin of &quot;The&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Always&quot; is filled with big, sentimental moments, it lacks the intimacy to make any of this very moving.&quot;

After a brief setback in which Spielberg felt &quot;artistically stalled&quot;, he returned in 1991 with &quot;Hook&quot;, about a middle-aged Peter Pan (Robin Williams), who returns to Neverland and encounters Tinker Bell (Julia Roberts) and the eponymous Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman). During filming, the stars clashed on set; Spielberg told &quot;60 Minutes&quot; that he would never work with Roberts again. Nominated for five Academy Awards, the studio enjoyed the film but most critics did not; Thomson called it &quot;maudlin&quot;. Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Desson Howe described the film as &quot;too industrially organized&quot;, and thought it mundane. At the box office, it earned more than $300 million worldwide from a $70 million budget.

=== 1993–1998: Oscar winner===

In 1993, Spielberg returned to the adventure genre with &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, based on Michael Crichton&#x27;s bestseller, with a screenplay by Crichton and David Koepp. &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; is set on a fictional island near Costa Rica, where a businessman (Richard Attenborough) has hired a team of geneticists to create a wildlife park of de-extinct dinosaurs. In a departure from his usual order of planning, Spielberg and the designers storyboarded certain sequences from the novel early on. The film also used computer-generated imagery provided by Industrial Light &amp; Magic; &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was completed on time and became the highest-grossing film at the time, and won three Academy Awards. The film&#x27;s dominance during its theatrical run, as well as Spielberg&#x27;s $250 million salary, made him self-conscious of his own success.

Also in 1993, Spielberg directed &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, about Oskar Schindler, a businessman who helped save 1,100 Jews from the Holocaust. Based on &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot;, Spielberg waited ten years to make the film as he did not feel &quot;mature&quot; enough. He wanted to embrace his heritage, and after the birth of his son, Max, he said that &quot;it greatly affected me [...] A spirit began to ignite in me, and I became a Jewish dad&quot;. Filming commenced on March 1, 1993, in Poland, while Spielberg was still editing &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; in the evenings. To make filming &quot;bearable&quot;, Spielberg brought his wife and children with him. Against expectations, the film was a commercial success, and Spielberg used his percentage of profits to start the Shoah Foundation, a non-profit organization that archives testimonies of Holocaust survivors. &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Spielberg&#x27;s first as Best Director. It also won seven BAFTAs, and three Golden Globes. &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; is one of the AFI&#x27;s 100 best American films ever made.
Ebert wrote, &quot;Flaubert once wrote that he disliked &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; because the author was constantly preaching against slavery. &#x27;Does one have to make observations about slavery?&#x27; he asked. &#x27;Depict it; that&#x27;s enough.&#x27; And then he added, &#x27;An author in his book must be like God in the universe, present everywhere and visible nowhere.&#x27; That would describe Spielberg, the author of this film. He depicts the evil of the Holocaust, and he tells an incredible story of how it was robbed of some of its intended victims. He does so without the tricks of his trade, the directorial and dramatic contrivances that would inspire the usual melodramatic payoffs. Spielberg is not visible in this film. But his restraint and passion are present in every shot.&quot; Filmmaker Claude Lanzmann, criticized the film for its weak representation of the Holocaust. Imre Kertész, a Hungarian author and concentration camp survivor, also disliked the film, saying, &quot;I regard as kitsch any representation of the Holocaust that is incapable of understanding or unwilling to understand the organic connection between our own deformed mode of life and the very possibility of the Holocaust.&quot; Thomson calls it &quot;the most moving film I have ever seen.&quot;

In 1994, Spielberg took a break from directing to spend more time with his family, and set up his new film studio, DreamWorks, with Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. After his hiatus, he returned to directing with a sequel to &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; (1997). A loose adaptation of Michael Crichton&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lost World&quot;, the plot follows mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) and his researchers who study dinosaurs at Jurassic Park which is on an island and are confronted by another team with a different agenda. Spielberg wanted the onscreen creatures to be more realistic than in the first film; he used 3D storyboards, computer imagery and robotic puppets. Budgeted at $73 million, &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot; opened in May 1997 and was one of the highest grossing films of the year. The &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic opined that &quot;The Lost World&quot; was &quot;better crafted but less fun&quot; than the first film, while &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote &quot;It looks like a director on autopilot [...] The special effects brook no argument.&quot;
&quot;Amistad&quot; (1997), his first film released under DreamWorks, was based on the true story of the events in 1839 aboard the slave ship &quot;La Amistad&quot;. Producer Debbie Allen, who had read the book &quot;Amistad I&quot; in 1978, thought Spielberg would be perfect to direct. Spielberg was hesitant taking on the project, afraid that it would be compared to &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, but he said, &quot;I&#x27;ve never planned my career [...] In the end I do what I think I gotta do.&quot; Starring Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins, Djimon Hounsou and Matthew McConaughey, Spielberg used Allen&#x27;s ten years worth of research to reenact the difficult historical scenes. The film struggled to find an audience, and underperformed at the box office; Spielberg admitted that &quot;Amistad&quot; &quot;became too much of a history lesson&quot;.

Spielberg&#x27;s 1998 release was World War II epic &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, about a group of US soldiers led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) sent to bring home a paratrooper whose three older brothers were killed in the same twenty-four hours of the Normandy landing. Filming took place in England, and US Marine Dale Dye was hired to train the actors and keep them in character during the combat scenes. Halfway through filming, Spielberg reminded the cast that they were making a tribute to thank &quot;your grandparents and my dad, who fought in [the war]&quot;. Upon release, critics praised the direction and its realistic portrayal of war. The film grossed a successful $481 million worldwide and Spielberg won a second Academy Award for Best Director. In August 1999, Spielberg and Hanks were awarded the Distinguished Public Service Medal from Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen. Thomson writes &quot;&quot;Ryan&quot; changed war films: combat, shock, wounds, and fear had never been so graphically presented; and yet there was also a true sense of what duties and ideas had felt like in 1944. I disliked the framing device. I would have admired a director who trusted us to get there without that. Never mind—&quot;Ryan&quot; is a magnificent film.&quot; Ebert wrote &quot;Spielberg knows how to make audiences weep better than any director since Chaplin in &quot;City Lights.&quot; But weeping is an incomplete response, letting the audience off the hook. This film embodies ideas. After the immediate experience begins to fade, the implications remain and grow.&quot;

===2001–2012: Master of technology ===

Spielberg returned to science fiction with &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; (2001), a loose adaptation of Brian Aldiss&#x27;s short story &quot;Supertoys Last All Summer Long&quot; (1969). Stanley Kubrick had bought the rights to the story in 1979 and worked on an adaptation for years. He told Spielberg about the project in 1984 and suggested that he direct, believing the story was closer to Spielberg&#x27;s sensibilities. In 1999, Kubrick died. Spielberg decided to direct &quot;A.I.&quot; and wrote the screenplay himself. Spielberg tried to be faithful to Kubrick&#x27;s vision and made several allusions to his friend&#x27;s work though with mixed results according to some critics. The plot revolves around an android, David (Haley Joel Osment) who, like Pinocchio, dreams of being a &quot;real boy&quot;. The film won five Saturn Awards and grossed $236 million worldwide. Jonathan Rosenbaum highly praised the film: &quot;If &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; — a film whose split personality is apparent even in its two-part title — is as much a Kubrick movie as a Spielberg one, this is in large part because it defamiliarizes Spielberg, makes him strange. Yet it also defamiliarizes Kubrick, with equally ambiguous results — making his unfamiliarity familiar. Both filmmakers should be credited for the results—Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick&#x27;s intentions while making it a profoundly personal work.&quot; A. O. Scott called it &quot;the best fairy tale–the most disturbing, complex and intellectually challenging boy&#x27;s adventure story–Mr. Spielberg has made&quot; and chose it as the best film of the year and one of the best of the decade.

Spielberg followed &quot;A.I.&quot; with the sci-fi neo-noir &quot;Minority Report&quot; (2002), based on Philip K. Dick&#x27;s short story (1956). The film stars Tom Cruise as commanding officer of precrime in futuristic Washington, D.C. Ebert named &quot;Minority Report&quot; the best film of 2002, praising its craftsmanship: &quot;here is Spielberg using every trick in the book and matching them without seams, so that no matter how he&#x27;s achieving his effects, the focus is always on the story and the characters ... Some directors place their trust in technology. Spielberg, who is a master of technology, trusts only story and character, and then uses everything else as a workman uses his tools.&quot; However, critic Todd McCarthy thought there was not enough action. The film earned more than $358 million worldwide. Also in 2002, he released &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, based on the autobiography of con-artist Frank Abagnale. Leonardo DiCaprio played Abangale; Christopher Walken and Hanks also starred. Spielberg said, &quot;I have always loved movies about sensational rogues—they break the law, but you just have to love them for the moxie.&quot; The film was a critical and commercial success.

Spielberg followed &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot; with &quot;The Terminal&quot; (2004), a comedy loosely inspired by the true story of Mehran Karimi Nasseri and by Jacques Tati&#x27;s &quot;Playtime&quot; (1967). The film follows Viktor Navorski (Hanks), an Eastern European man who, after a coup in his home country, is stranded in John F. Kennedy International Airport. It features Catherine Zeta-Jones as a flight attendant and Stanley Tucci as a customs and immigration official. Ebert wrote of Viktor&#x27;s predicament: &quot;The immigration service, and indeed the American legal system, has no way of dealing with him because Viktor does not do, or fail to do, any of the things the system is set up to prevent him from doing, or not doing. He has slipped through a perfect logical loophole. &quot;The Terminal&quot; is like a sunny Kakfa story, in which it is the citizen who persecutes the bureaucracy.&quot; The titular terminal was a real set built by Alex McDowell. In 2005, Spielberg directed &quot;War of the Worlds,&quot; a co-production of Paramount and DreamWorks, based on H. G. Wells&#x27;s novel of the same name; Spielberg had been a fan of the book and of George Pal&#x27;s 1953 film. Starring Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning, the film is about an American dock worker who is forced to look after his children, from whom he lives separately, as he tries to protect and reunite them with their mother when extraterrestrials invade Earth. Spielberg used storyboards to help the actors react to computer imagery that they could not see and used natural lighting and camerawork to avoid an &quot;over stylized&quot; science fiction picture. The film was a box office hit grossing more than $600 million worldwide.

Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Munich&quot; (2005) is about the Israeli government&#x27;s secret retaliation after eleven Israeli Olympic athletes were kidnapped and murdered in the 1972 Munich massacre. The film is based on &quot;Vengeance&quot;, a book by Canadian journalist George Jonas. It was previously adapted for the screen in the 1986 television film &quot;Sword of Gideon&quot;. Spielberg, who personally remembers the incident, sought advice from former president Bill Clinton, among others, before making the film because he did not want to cause further problems in the Middle East. Although the film garnered mostly positive reviews, some critics perceived it as anti-Semitic; it is one of Spielberg&#x27;s most controversial films to date. &quot;Munich&quot; received five Academy Awards nominations: Best Picture, Best Film Editing, Best Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Director for Spielberg. It was his sixth Best Director nomination, and fifth Best Picture nomination.

In the mid-2000s, Spielberg scaled down his directing career and became more selective about film projects to undertake. In December 2005, he and his partners sold DreamWorks to media conglomerate Viacom (now known as Paramount Global). The sale was finalized in February 2006. In June 2006, Spielberg planned to make &quot;Interstellar&quot;, but abandoned the project, which was eventually directed by Christopher Nolan. During this period, Spielberg remained active as a producer. Spielberg returned to the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; series in 2008 with the fourth installment, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.&quot; Released nineteen years after &quot;Last Crusade&quot;, the film is set in 1957, pitting Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) against Soviet agents led by Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett), searching for a telepathic crystal skull. Principal photography was complete in October 2007, and the film was released on May 22, 2008. This was his first film not released by DreamWorks since 1997. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, but some fans were disappointed by the introduction of science fiction elements which were uncharacteristic of the previous films. Writing for &quot;The Age&quot;, Tom Ryan praised Spielberg and George Lucas for their realistic 1950s setting—&quot;The energy on display is impressive&quot;. It was a box office success, grossing $790 million worldwide.

Starting in 2009, Spielberg shot the first film in a planned trilogy of motion capture films based on Hergé&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. Spielberg had long been a fan of the comics, and per Michael Farr, Hergé &quot;thought Spielberg was the only person who could ever do Tintin justice.&quot; &quot;The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; was co-produced by Peter Jackson and premiered in Brussels, Belgium. The film was released in North American theaters on December 21, 2011, in Digital 3D and IMAX. It received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $373 million worldwide. &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; won Best Animated Feature at the 69th Golden Globe Awards. Spielberg followed &quot;Tintin&quot; with &quot;War Horse&quot;, shot in England in the summer of 2010. It was released four days after &quot;Tintin&quot;, on December 25, 2011. The film is based on Michael Morpurgo&#x27;s 1982 novel of the same name and follows the long friendship between a British boy and his horse Joey before and during World War I. Distributed by Walt Disney Studios with whom DreamWorks made a distribution deal in 2009, &quot;War Horse&quot; was the first of four consecutive Spielberg films released by Disney. It received acclaim from critics and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. In a review for &quot;Salon&quot; magazine, Andrew O&#x27;Hehir wrote, &quot;at this point in his career Spielberg is pursuing personal goals, and everything that&#x27;s terrific and overly flat and tooth-rottingly sweet about &quot;War Horse&quot; reflects that.&quot;
Spielberg directed the historical drama &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2012), starring Daniel Day-Lewis as President Abraham Lincoln and Sally Field as Mary Todd Lincoln. Based on Doris Kearns Goodwin&#x27;s book &quot;Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln&quot; and written by Tony Kushner, the film depicts the final four months of Lincoln&#x27;s life. The film was shot in Richmond, Virginia in late 2011. and was released in the US in November 2012. &quot;Lincoln&quot; was acclaimed and earned more than $250 million worldwide. It was nominated for twelve Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, winning Best Production Design and Best Actor for Day-Lewis&#x27;s performance. Donald Clarke from &quot;The Irish Times&quot; praised the direction: &quot;Against the odds, Spielberg makes something genuinely exciting of the backstage wheedling.&quot;

=== 2013–present: Recent work ===

It was announced on May 2, 2013, that Spielberg would direct &quot;American Sniper,&quot; but he left the project before production began. Instead, he directed &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot; (2015), a Cold War thriller based on the 1960 U-2 incident, and focusing on James B. Donovan&#x27;s negotiations with the Soviets for the release of pilot Gary Powers after his aircraft was shot down over Soviet territory. It was written by Matt Charman and the Coen brothers, and starred Tom Hanks as Donovan, as well as Mark Rylance, Amy Ryan and Alan Alda. It was filmed in the fall of 2014 in New York City, Berlin and Wroclaw, and was released on October 16. &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot; was popular with critics, and was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture; Rylance won Best Supporting Actor, becoming the second actor to win for a performance directed by Spielberg.

In 2016, Spielberg made &quot;The BFG,&quot; an adaptation of Roald Dahl&#x27;s children&#x27;s book, starring newcomer Ruby Barnhill, and Mark Rylance as the titular Big Friendly Giant. DreamWorks bought the rights in 2010, and John Madden had intended to direct. The film was the last to be written by &quot;E.T.&quot; screenwriter Melissa Mathison before her death. It was co-produced and released by Walt Disney Pictures, marking the first Disney-branded film to be directed by Spielberg. &quot;The BFG&quot; premiered as an out-of-competition entry at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, and received a wide release in the US on July 1, 2016. &quot;The BFG&quot; received fair reviews; Michael Phillips of &quot;The Chicago Tribune&quot; compared certain scenes to the works of Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick, while &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;″s Liz Braun thought that there were &quot;moments of wonder and delight&quot; but it was too long.

A year later, Spielberg directed &quot;The Post&quot;, an account of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; printing of the &quot;Pentagon Papers&quot;. Starring Tom Hanks and Meryl Streep, production began in New York on May 30, 2017. Spielberg stated his attraction to the project: &quot;When I read the first draft of the script, this wasn&#x27;t something that could wait three years or two years—this was a story I felt we needed to tell today.&quot; The film received a wide release on January 12, 2018. &quot;The Post&quot; gained positive reception; the critic from the &quot;Associated Press&quot; thought &quot;Spielberg infuses every scene with tension and life and the grandeur of the ordinary that he&#x27;s always been so good at conveying.&quot; In 2017, Spielberg and Paul Greengrass, Francis Ford Coppola, Guillermo del Toro and Lawrence Kasdan were featured in the Netflix documentary series &quot;Five Came Back&quot;, about the war-related works of directors Frank Capra, John Ford, John Huston, George Stevens and William Wyler. Spielberg was also an executive producer.
Spielberg directed the science fiction &quot;Ready Player One&quot; (2018), adapted from the novel of the same name by Ernest Cline. It stars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, Lena Waithe, T.J. Miller, Simon Pegg, and Mark Rylance. The plot takes place in 2045 when much of humanity uses virtual reality to escape the real world. &quot;Ready Player One&quot; began production in July 2016, and was intended to be released on December 15, 2017, but was moved to March 2018 to avoid competition with &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot;. It premiered at the 2018 South by Southwest film festival. Spielberg&#x27;s direction was praised along with the action scenes and visual effects, but many critics thought the film was too long and overused 1980s nostalgia.

In 2019, Spielberg filmed &quot;West Side Story&quot;, an adaptation of the musical of the same name. It stars Ansel Elgort and Rachel Zegler in her film debut with Ariana DeBose, David Alvarez, Mike Faist, and Rita Moreno in supporting roles. Written by Tony Kushner, the film stays true to the 1950s setting. &quot;West Side Story&quot; was released in December 2021 to positive reviews and received seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, and Best Director. Spielberg also received nominations from the Golden Globe Awards, Directors Guild of America, and Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards. &quot;The Economist&quot; praised the choreography, stating that it &quot;stunningly melds beauty and violence&quot;. In March 2022, Spielberg said that &quot;West Side Story&quot; would be the last musical he will direct.

Spielberg&#x27;s 2022 film &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; is a fictionalized account of his own adolescence, which he wrote with Tony Kushner. Gabriel LaBelle plays Sammy Fabelman, a character inspired by Spielberg, while Michelle Williams plays Sammy&#x27;s mother Mitzi Fabelman, Paul Dano plays Burt Fabelman, his father, Seth Rogen plays Bennie Loewy, Burt&#x27;s best friend and co-worker who becomes Sammy&#x27;s surrogate uncle, and Judd Hirsch as Mitzi&#x27;s Uncle Boris. Filming began in Los Angeles in July 2021, and the film premiered at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival on September 10, Spielberg&#x27;s first appearance at that festival. It received widespread critical acclaim and won the festival&#x27;s People&#x27;s Choice Award. It received a limited theatrical release on November 11, 2022, by Universal Pictures, before expanding wide on November 23.
Despite the favorable critical reception, &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; were box office failures, which &quot;Variety&quot; suggested could be attributed to a decline in the popularity of Spielberg in a film-going environment altered by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the public&#x27;s loss of interest in prestige films. &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; received seven Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. It was, however, a major box office success in France and became the highest-rated film of the 21st century in the country, with a 4.9 average from critics on AlloCiné from 43 reviews, with all but 6 giving the film 5 stars. &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; wrote that Spielberg, at age 76, had &quot;come to represent like no other, the idea of cinema as wonder, at a time when the relationship to the spectacular and the cinema seems more tormented than ever&quot; and declared that the film will &quot;undoubtedly remain the most important and singular film of his career&quot;.

Spielberg had planned to direct &quot;Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny&quot;, but he stepped down and was replaced by James Mangold. Spielberg said that he would remain &quot;hands on&quot; as a producer, along with Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall. In 2016, it was announced that it would be written by David Koepp, with a release by Disney on July 19, 2019. After a change of filming and release dates, it was postponed again when Jonathan Kasdan was announced as the film&#x27;s new writer. Soon after, a new release date of July 9, 2021, was announced. In May 2019, Dan Fogelman was hired to write a new script, and Kasdan&#x27;s story, focused on the Nazi gold train, would not be used; the script was ultimately credited to Mangold, Koepp, Jez Butterworth, and John-Henry Butterworth. In April 2020, it was announced that the release of the film was delayed to July 29, 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and in October 2021, the release date was again delayed to June 30, 2023. The film began production in the UK in June 2021 and finished in February 2022.

In February 2025, Spielberg began shooting his next film, &quot;Disclosure&quot;, reportedly about UFOs. The screenplay was written by David Koepp, based on an original idea from Spielberg. The film will star Emily Blunt, Josh O&#x27;Connor, Colman Domingo, Colin Firth, and Eve Hewson, and is set to be released in theatres on May 15, 2026 by Universal Pictures.

== Other ventures ==
===Production===
Spielberg&#x27;s first film as an executive producer was the directorial debut of Robert Zemeckis, &quot;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&quot; (1978). He produced Zemeckis&#x27;s dark comedy &quot;Used Cars&quot; (1980), which was a critical but not a commercial success. In 1980, Spielberg, Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall founded Amblin Productions; the first film it produced was the romantic comedy &quot;Continental Divide&quot; (Michael Apted, 1981). It went on to produce &quot;Gremlins&quot; (Joe Dante, 1984), &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (Zemeckis, 1985), &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (Zemeckis, 1988), &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot; (John Patrick Shanley, 1990), &quot;Men in Black&quot; (Barry Sonnenfeld, 1997) and &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (Martin Campbell, 1998). For some, including &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot; (Barry Levinson, 1985) and &quot;Harry and the Hendersons&quot; (William Dear, 1987), the title &quot;Steven Spielberg Presents&quot; was in the opening credits. It produced Don Bluth&#x27;s animated films &quot;An American Tail&quot; (1986) and &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; (1988), leading to the spin-off Amblimation. In 1985, NBC offered Spielberg a two-year contract on a television series, &quot;Amazing Stories;&quot; the show was marketed as a blend of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; and &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. NBC gave Spielberg creative control and a budget of $1 million for each episode. After two seasons and disappointing ratings, the show was not renewed. Although Spielberg&#x27;s involvement as a producer would vary widely from project to project, Zemeckis said that Spielberg would always &quot;respect the filmmaker&#x27;s vision&quot;. Over the next decade, Spielberg&#x27;s record as a producer brought mixed critical and commercial results. In 1992, Spielberg began to scale back producing, saying &quot;Producing has been the least fulfilling aspect of what I&#x27;ve done in the last decade.&quot; He produced cartoons such as &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;, &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, &quot;Family Dog&quot;, &quot;Freakazoid!&quot;, and &quot;Pinky and the Brain&quot;. He produced &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; by Errol Morris.

In 1993, Spielberg served as an executive producer for the NBC science fiction series &quot;seaQuest DSV;&quot; the show was not a hit. In 1994, he found success producing the medical drama &quot;ER&quot;.
That year, Spielberg founded DreamWorks with Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. Spielberg cited greater creative control and distribution improvements as the main reasons for founding his own studio; he and his partners compared themselves to the founders of United Artists in 1919. DreamWorks&#x27; investors included Microsoft founders Paul Allen and Bill Gates. After founding DreamWorks, Spielberg continued to operate Amblin Entertainment and direct films for other studios. He helped design &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;: The Ride at Universal Studios Florida. The workload of filmmaking and operating a studio raised questions about his commitments, but Spielberg maintained that &quot;this is all fitting nicely into my life and I&#x27;m still home by six and I&#x27;m still home on the weekends.&quot; In 1998, DreamWorks Animation produced its first full-length animated features, &quot;Antz&quot; and &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;. &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001) was the first winner of the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.

Spielberg and Tom Hanks produced &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; (2001), a ten-part HBO miniseries based on Stephen E. Ambrose&#x27;s book of the same name. It follows Easy Company of the 101st Airborne Division&#x27;s 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment. It won a Golden Globe for Best Miniseries. He produced &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; (2005), an adaptation of Arthur Golden&#x27;s novel of the same name. Spielberg and Zemeckis executive-produced the animated film &quot;Monster House&quot; (2006), marking their eighth collaboration. He also worked with Clint Eastwood for the first time, co-producing &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; and &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot; with Robert Lorenz. Spielberg served as executive producer for &quot;Disturbia,&quot; (2007) and the &quot;Transformers&quot; film series. That same year, Spielberg and Mark Burnett co-produced &quot;On the Lot,&quot; a reality and competition show about filmmaking. Spielberg returned to the World War II theme, co-producing the 2010 miniseries &quot;The Pacific&quot; with Hanks and Gary Goetzman. It is centered on the battles in the Pacific Theater. The next year, Spielberg co-created &quot;Falling Skies&quot;, a science fiction series on TNT, with Robert Rodat and produced the 2011 Fox series &quot;Terra Nova&quot; and J. J. Abrams&#x27;s &quot;Super 8&quot;.

In January 2013, HBO confirmed that it was developing a World War II miniseries based on the book Donald L. Miller&#x27;s &quot;Masters of the Air&quot; with Spielberg and Hanks. &quot;NME&quot; reported in March 2017 that production was under the working title &quot;The Mighty Eighth&quot;. By 2019, it was confirmed development of the miniseries, now titled &quot;Masters of the Air&quot;, had moved to Apple TV+. The series premiered on January 26, 2024. On January 18, 2023, Spielberg told press at a red carpet event for &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; that he was executive producing a documentary about John Williams, directed by Laurent Bouzereau with production companies Amblin Television, Imagine Documentaries, and Nedland Media. Other executive producers for the film include Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Darryl Frank, Justin Falvey, Justin Wilkes, Sara Bernstein, and Meredith Kaulfers. The announcement came days after Williams suggested that he might not retire from film scoring as he had previously announced. The film, &quot;Music by John Williams&quot;, premiered at the 2024 AFI Fest.

=== Upcoming and prospective projects===
In May 2009, Spielberg bought the rights to the life story of Martin Luther King Jr., with the intention of being involved as both the producer and director. The purchase was made from the King estate, led by son Dexter, while the two other surviving children, the Reverend Bernice and Martin III, immediately threatened to sue, not having given their approvals to the project. In March 2013, Spielberg announced that he was developing a miniseries based on the life of Napoleon. In May 2016, it was announced that Cary Joji Fukunaga was in talks to direct the miniseries for HBO, from a script by David Leland based on extensive research materials accumulated by Stanley Kubrick over the years.

Spielberg was set to film an adaptation of David I. Kertzer&#x27;s &quot;The Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara&quot; in early 2017, for release at the end of that year, but production was ultimately postponed. It was first announced in 2014, with Tony Kushner adapting the book for the screen. Mark Rylance, in his fourth collaboration with Spielberg, was announced to star in the role of Pope Pius IX. Spielberg saw more than 2,000 children to play the role of the young Edgardo Mortara. In 2015, it was announced that Spielberg was attached to direct an adaptation of American photojournalist Lynsey Addario&#x27;s memoir &quot;It&#x27;s What I Do,&quot; with Jennifer Lawrence in the lead role. In April 2018, it was announced that Spielberg would direct a film adaptation of the &quot;Blackhawk&quot; comic book series. Warner Bros. would distribute the film with David Koepp writing the script.

On June 21, 2021, it was announced that Amblin Entertainment signed a deal with Netflix to release multiple new feature films for the streaming service. Under the deal, Amblin is expected to produce at least two films a year for Netflix for an unspecified number of years. In February 2022, &quot;Deadline Hollywood&quot; reported that Spielberg was developing an original film centered around the character Frank Bullitt, a fictional San Francisco police officer originally portrayed by Steve McQueen in the 1968 film &quot;Bullitt&quot;. The screenplay is set to be written by Josh Singer, who previously co-wrote &quot;The Post&quot; for Spielberg. McQueen&#x27;s son Chad and granddaughter Molly will serve as executive producers. Bradley Cooper was cast as Bullitt in November 2022 and will also serve as producer alongside Spielberg and Kristie Macosko Krieger.

On February 14, 2025, it was announced that &quot;The Goonies 2&quot; was in the works with Speilberg producing.

=== Video games ===
Spielberg has been an avid gamer since 1974. Spielberg played many of LucasArts adventure games, including the first &quot;Monkey Island&quot; games.

In 1995, Spielberg helped create and design LucasArts&#x27; adventure game &quot;The Dig&quot;. He also collaborated with software publishers Knowledge Adventure on the game &quot;Steven Spielberg&#x27;s Director&#x27;s Chair&quot;, which was released in 1996; Spielberg appears in the game to direct the player.

In 2015, Spielberg lent his likeness in Yakuza 0 in a sidestory where he directed Miracle Johnson&#x27;s video of Thriller.

In 2005, Spielberg collaborated with Electronic Arts (EA) on several games including one for the Wii called &quot;Boom Blox,&quot; and its sequel &quot;Boom Blox Bash Party&quot;. He is also the creator of EA&#x27;s &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; series.

In 2008, he owned a Wii, a PlayStation 3, a PSP, and an Xbox 360, and enjoyed playing first-person shooters such as the &quot;Medal of Honor&quot; series and &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot;. He dislikes the use of cutscenes in games, and thinks that natural storytelling is a challenge for game developers.

=== Theatre ===
Spielberg first ventured into theatre producing in 1997, with his involvement on a production of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;, as well as the original 1998 production of &quot;The Farnsworth Invention&quot;. In 2022, he made his Broadway producing debut as a co-producer on the musical &quot;A Strange Loop&quot;. He went on to produce the stage musical adaptations of &quot;Water for Elephants&quot; and &quot;Death Becomes Her&quot; alongside his wife Kate Capshaw, both in 2024. He will next co-produce the upcoming stage adaptation of &quot;Smash&quot;, based on the 2012 NBC television series of the same name, on which he served as an executive producer. It is set to begin performances in 2025.

== Filmmaking style and techniques ==

=== Influences ===

Spielberg cites John Ford as a formative influence: &quot;I try to rent a John Ford film... before I start every movie, simply because he inspires me... He&#x27;s like a classic painter, he celebrates the frame, not just what&#x27;s inside it.&quot; He names Frank Capra&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s A Wonderful Life&quot; (1946) as an influence on themes of &quot;family, community and suburbia&quot;. He enjoyed the work of Alfred Hitchcock, David Lean, Stanley Kubrick and John Frankenheimer. In college, he was inspired by foreign films by Ingmar Bergman, Jacques Tati and François Truffaut. Spencer Tracy has also influenced the characters of Spielberg&#x27;s films, as did &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. He says &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; is the film he&#x27;s seen more times than any other. With Martin Scorsese, Spielberg helped with the restoration of &quot;Lawrence&quot; by Robert A. Harris. Among films by his contemporaries, Spielberg was influenced by Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot;: &quot;I was pulverized by the story and the effect the film had on me... I also felt that I should quit, that there was no reason I should continue directing because I would never achieve that level of confidence and ability to tell a story.&quot; In 2005, Coppola contacted Spielberg about restoring the film; Spielberg contacted studio head Brad Grey. In 1982, Spielberg bought one of the prop sleds from &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. Spielberg called &quot;Kane&quot; &#x27;the most classic movie ever made,&quot; and the sled &quot;a symbolic emblem of quality in the film business&quot;.

=== Method and themes ===
Spielberg often uses storyboards to visualize sequences, eschewing them for &quot;E.T. the Extraterrestrial&quot; and &quot;The Color Purple&quot; for a more spontaneous effect. After filming &quot;Jaws&quot;, Spielberg learned to save special effects scenes until last and to exclude the media from filming locations. Spielberg prefers to shoot quickly, with large amounts of coverage (from single-shot to multi-shot setups), so that he will have many options in the editing room. From the beginning of his career, Spielberg&#x27;s shooting style consisted of extreme high and low camera angles, long takes, and handheld cameras. He favors wide-angle lens for creating depth, and by the time he was making &quot;Minority Report&quot;, he was more confident with elaborate camera movements.

In an interview with &quot;The Tech&quot; in 2015, Spielberg described how he chooses his film projects:Spielberg&#x27;s films contain many recurrent themes. One of the most pertinent revolves around &quot;ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances&quot;. The ordinary people often have limitations, but they succeed in becoming a &quot;hero&quot;. A consistent theme in his family-friendly work is a childlike sense of wonder and faith, and &quot;the goodness in humanity will prevail&quot;. He has also explored the importance of childhood, loss of innocence, and the need for parental figures. In exploring the parent-child relationship, there is usually a flawed or irresponsible father figure. This theme personally resonates with Spielberg&#x27;s childhood. Exploring extraterrestrial life is another aspect to his work. Spielberg described himself as like an &quot;alien&quot; during childhood, and this interest came from his father, a science fiction fan.

=== Collaborators ===
Michael Kahn has edited all of Spielberg&#x27;s films since 1977, with the exception of &quot;E.T.&quot; (1982). Spielberg has also worked consistently with production designer Rick Carter and writer David Koepp. The producer Kathleen Kennedy is one of Spielberg&#x27;s longest serving collaborators. Spielberg also displays loyalty to his actors, casting them repeatedly, including Tom Hanks, Harrison Ford, Mark Rylance, Richard Dreyfuss and Tom Cruise. In 2005, Cruise called him &quot;the greatest storyteller cinema&#x27;s ever known&quot;.

Hanks has collaborated with Spielberg on various projects in both film and television. He first worked with Spielberg in &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998) for which he received a nomination for Academy Award for Best Actor. Hanks starred in four more films, &quot;Catch Me if You Can&quot; (2002), &quot;The Terminal&quot; (2004), &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot; (2015) and &quot;The Post&quot; (2017). The pair also executive produced the war miniseries &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Pacific&quot; (2010), both of which gained them Primetime Emmy Awards.

Janusz Kamiński has served as a cinematographer on dozens of Spielberg&#x27;s films. Kamiński&#x27;s first collaboration with Spielberg started with the holocaust drama film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993) for which Kamiński received the Academy Award for Best Cinematography. The film used black-and-white cinematography. As Spielberg&#x27;s career evolved from action to drama films, he and Kamiński adopted more handheld camerawork, as evidenced in &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and &quot;Amistad&quot;. Kamiński would later receive his second Academy Award for cinematography on &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. The film&#x27;s opening sequence to re-enact the invasion of Normandy was praised for realism. Kamiński garnered three more Academy Award nominations for his work on &quot;War Horse&quot; (2011), the historical epic &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2015), and &quot;West Side Story&quot; (2021).

Spielberg&#x27;s long-time partnership with composer John Williams began with &quot;The Sugarland Express&quot; (1974) Williams would return to compose all but five of Spielberg&#x27;s feature films (the exceptions are &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot;, &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, &quot;Bridge of Spies&quot;, &quot;Ready Player One&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot;). Williams won three of his five Academy Awards for Best Original Score for his work on Spielberg&#x27;s films, which were &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975), &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982), and &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993). While making &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, Spielberg approached Williams about composing the score. After seeing a rough, unedited cut, Williams was impressed, and said that composing would be too challenging. He said to Spielberg, &quot;You need a better composer than I am for this film.&quot; Spielberg responded, &quot;I know. But they&#x27;re all dead!&quot; In 2016, Spielberg presented Williams with the 44th AFI Life Achievement Award, the first to be awarded to a composer. &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; (2022) was Williams&#x27;s 29th collaboration with Spielberg.

== Personal life ==
Spielberg met actress Amy Irving in 1976 when she auditioned for &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. After meeting her, Spielberg told his co-producer Julia Phillips, &quot;I met a real heartbreaker last night.&quot; Although she was too young for the role, she and Spielberg began dating and she eventually moved into what she described as his &quot;bachelor funky&quot; house. They broke up in 1979. In 1984, they renewed their romance and married in November 1985. Their son, Max, had been born on June 13 of that year. In 1989, the couple divorced; they agreed to live near each other to share custody of their son. Their divorce settlement is one of the most expensive in history.

Spielberg met actress Kate Capshaw when he cast her in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;. They married on October 12, 1991; Capshaw converted to Judaism before their marriage. Spielberg said he rediscovered &quot;the honor of being a Jew&quot; when they married. He said, &quot;Kate is Protestant and she insisted on converting to Judaism. She spent a year studying, did the &quot;mikveh&quot;, the whole thing. She chose to do a full conversion &quot;before&quot; we were married in 1991, and she married me after becoming a Jew. I think that, more than anything else, brought me back to Judaism.&quot; He credits her for the family&#x27;s level of observance; &quot;This shiksa goddess has made me a better Jew than my own parents&quot;, he said. He and his family live in Pacific Palisades, California and East Hampton, New York.

He has five children with Capshaw: Sasha Rebecca Spielberg (born May 14, 1990), Sawyer Avery Spielberg (born March 10, 1992), and Destry Allyn Spielberg (born December 1, 1996), and two adopted children: Theo Spielberg (born August 21, 1988), and Mikaela George (born February 28, 1996). He also has a stepdaughter, Jessica Capshaw (born August 9, 1976). He is the godfather of Drew Barrymore and Gwyneth Paltrow.

In 1997, a man named Jonathan Norman stalked Spielberg and attempted to enter his home; Norman was jailed for 25 years.Prosecutors described Norman as sexually obsessed with the director. In 2001, Spielberg was stalked by conspiracy theorist and former social worker Diana Napolis. She accused him and actress Jennifer Love Hewitt, of installing a mind-control device in her brain, and being part of a satanic cult. Napolis was committed to a mental institution, and pled guilty to stalking. She was released on probation with a condition that she have no contact with either Spielberg or Hewitt.

Spielberg was diagnosed with dyslexia at age 60.

In 2013, Spielberg purchased the mega-yacht &quot;The Seven Seas&quot; for US$182 million. He has put it up for sale and has made it available for charter. At US$1.2 million per month, it is one of the most expensive charters on the market. The Canadian steel mogul Barry Zekelman bought it for US$150 millions and rechristened the ship &quot;Man of Steel&quot;. Thereafter, Spielberg ordered a new &quot;Seven Seas&quot;.

In 2022, at age 75, Spielberg was diagnosed with COVID-19 but recovered.

In December 2022, Spielberg was a guest on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; for BBC Radio 4, choosing for his luxury item an H-8 Bolex Camera.

== Political views ==
Spielberg has usually supported US Democratic Party candidates. He has donated over $800,000 to the Democratic party and its nominees. He has been a close friend of former president Bill Clinton and worked with the president for the USA Millennium celebrations. He directed an 18-minute film for the project, scored by John Williams and entitled &quot;The American Journey&quot;. It was shown at America&#x27;s Millennium Gala on December 31, 1999, in the National Mall at the Reflecting Pool at the base of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C. Spielberg endorsed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election; he donated $1 million to Priorities USA Action.

 Spielberg resigned as a member of the national advisory board of the Boy Scouts of America in 2001 because he disagreed with the organization&#x27;s anti-homosexuality stance. In 2007, the Arab League voted to boycott Spielberg&#x27;s movies after he donated $1 million for relief efforts in Israel during the 2006 Lebanon War. On February 20, 2007, Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and David Geffen invited Democrats to a fundraiser for Barack Obama.

In February 2008, Spielberg resigned as advisor to the 2008 Summer Olympics in response to the Chinese government&#x27;s inaction over the War in Darfur. Spielberg said in a statement, &quot;I find that my conscience will not allow me to continue business as usual [...] Sudan&#x27;s government bears the bulk of the responsibility for these on-going crimes, but the international community, and particularly China, should be doing more.&quot; The International Olympic Committee (IOC) respected Spielberg&#x27;s decision but IOC president Jacques Rogge expressed disappointment: &quot;[Spielberg] certainly would have brought a lot to the opening ceremony in terms of creativity.&quot; Chinese state media called Spielberg&#x27;s comments &quot;unfair&quot;.

In September 2008, Spielberg and his wife offered their support to same-sex marriage in California by issuing a statement following their donation of $100,000 to the &quot;No on Proposition 8&quot; campaign fund, a figure equal to the amount of money Brad Pitt donated to the same campaign less than a week prior. In 2018, Spielberg and his wife donated $500,000 to the March for Our Lives student demonstration in favor of gun control in the United States.

In December 2023, after the Hamas-led attack on Israel, the Shoah Foundation, which was founded by Spielberg, said that it had gathered over 100 video testimonies of those who experienced the attacks on that day to add them to the collection of &quot;Holocaust survivor and witness testimony.&quot; Speaking of the attacks he said, &quot;I never imagined I would see such unspeakable barbarity against Jews in my lifetime&quot; and that the Shoah Foundation project will ensure &quot;that their stories would be recorded and shared in the effort to preserve history and to work toward a world without antisemitism or hate of any kind&quot;.

== Filmography ==

Prolific in film since the 1960s, Spielberg has directed 36 feature films, and co-produced many works.

== Awards and honors ==

Spielberg has won three Academy Awards. He received nine nominations for Best Director, and won twice (for &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;). His third was in Best Picture, for &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List.&quot; He is the only director to receive a Best Director nomination from the academy in 6 different decades. In 1987, he was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his work as a creative producer. Drawing from his own experiences in Scouting, Spielberg helped the Boy Scouts of America develop a merit badge in cinematography to promote filmmaking as a marketable skill; the badge was launched at the 1989 National Scout Jamboree. In 1989, Spielberg was presented with the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award. Spielberg received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1995.

In 1998, he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. The award was presented to him by President Roman Herzog in recognition of &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; and work with the Shoah Foundation. Spielberg was awarded the Medal for Distinguished Public Service in 1999, in recognition for &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. For the same film, he also received an award for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures by the Directors Guild of America. The next year, he received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Directors Guild of America.
Spielberg was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003, located on 6801 Hollywood Boulevard.

On July 15, 2006, Spielberg was awarded the Gold Hugo Lifetime Achievement Award at the Summer Gala of the Chicago International Film Festival, and was awarded a Kennedy Center honor on December 3. The tribute to Spielberg featured a biographical short film narrated by Liam Neeson, and a performance of the finale to Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot;, conducted by John Williams.

The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Spielberg in 2005, the first year it considered non-literary contributors.

In 2009, Spielberg was awarded the Cecil B. DeMille Award by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for &quot;outstanding contributions to the world of entertainment&quot;.
In 2001, he was awarded an honorary knighthood, Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, by Queen Elizabeth II for services to the British film industry. Because he is not a British citizen, he did not kneel to be knighted, nor can he use the honorific prefix &quot;Sir&quot;, but he can use the suffix &quot;KBE.&quot; &quot;Premiere&quot; ranked him first place in the list of 100 Most Powerful People in Movies in 2003. In 2004, he was awarded France&#x27;s highest civil honor, the Legion of Honour by President Jacques Chirac. In June 2008, Spielberg received Arizona State University&#x27;s Hugh Downs Award for Communication Excellence.

In October 2011, he was made a Commander of the Order of the Belgian Crown, one of Belgium&#x27;s highest honors.
On November 19, 2013, Spielberg was honored by the National Archives and Records Administration with a Records of Achievement Award. Spielberg was given two facsimiles of the 13th Amendment; the first which passed in 1861 but was not ratified, and the second signed by Abraham Lincoln in 1865 to abolish slavery. The amendment and the process of passing it were the subject of his film &quot;Lincoln&quot;. On November 24, 2015, Spielberg was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama at the White House.

In July 2016, Spielberg was awarded a gold Blue Peter badge by the BBC children&#x27;s television program &quot;Blue Peter.&quot; He has honorary degrees from the University of Southern California, 1994; Brown University, 1999; Yale University, 2002; Boston University, 2009; and Harvard University, 2016.

== Legacy ==
A figure of the New Hollywood era, Spielberg is widely regarded as one of the most influential and commercially successful film directors of all time. Some of his films were in the top ten highest-grossing films of the 1970s and 1980s, with &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; all becoming the highest-grossing film ever at the time of their respective releases. In 1996, &quot;Life&quot; magazine named Spielberg the most influential person of his generation. In 2003, &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine ranked him first place in the list of 100 Most Powerful People in Movies&quot;.&quot; In 2005, &quot;Empire&quot; magazine ranked him number one on a list of the greatest film directors of all time. In 2013, &quot;Time&quot; magazine listed him as one of the 100 most influential people. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;″ magazine of Most Influential Celebrities of 2014, Spielberg was ranked at first place. As of December 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimates his net worth at $5.3billion, making him one of the richest people in the entertainment industry.

His work is admired by numerous acclaimed directors, including Robert Aldrich, Ingmar Bergman, Werner Herzog, Stanley Kubrick, David Lean, Sidney Lumet, Roman Polanski, Martin Scorsese, François Truffaut and Jean Renoir Spielberg&#x27;s films have also influenced directors J. J. Abrams, Paul Thomas Anderson, Neill Blomkamp, Jon M. Chu, Arnaud Desplechin, Gareth Edwards, Roland Emmerich, Enrique Gato, Max Hechtman, Don Hertzfeldt, Peter Jackson, Kal Ng, Jordan Peele, S. S. Rajamouli, Robert Rodriguez, John Sayles, Ridley Scott, John Singleton, Kevin Smith, and Michael Williams. In 2004, film critic Tom Shone said of Spielberg, &quot;If you have to point to any one director of the last twenty-five years [1979–2004] in whose work the medium of film was most fully itself–where we found out what it does best when left to its own devices, it has to be that guy.&quot; Jess Cagle, former editor of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, called Spielberg &quot;arguably (well, who would argue?) the greatest filmmaker in history.&quot; Stephen Rowley, writing for &quot;Senses of Cinema,&quot; discussed Spielberg&#x27;s strengths as a filmmaker, saying &quot;there is a welcome complexity of tone and approach in these later films that defies the lazy stereotypes often bandied about his films&quot;, and that &quot;Spielberg continues to take risks, with his body of work continuing to grow more impressive and ambitious&quot;, concluding that he has only received &quot;limited, begrudging recognition&quot; from critics. In a 1999 &quot;Millennium Movies&quot; survey of British film fans run by the Sky Premier channel, Spielberg had seven films in the top 100, which made him the most popular director.

Critics of Spielberg have argued that his films are commonly sentimental and moralistic. In &quot;Easy Riders, Raging Bulls&quot;, Peter Biskind wrote that Spielberg is &quot;infantilizing the audience, reconstituting the spectator as child, then overwhelming him and her with sound and spectacle, obliterating irony, aesthetic self-consciousness, and critical reflection&quot;. Critic Ray Carney and actor Crispin Glover opined that Spielberg&#x27;s works lack depth and do not take risks. Filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard opined that Spielberg was partly responsible for the lack of artistic merit in mainstream cinema, and accused Spielberg of using &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; to profit from a tragedy. In defense of Spielberg, critic Roger Ebert said &quot;Has Godard or any other director living or dead done more than Spielberg, with his Holocaust Project, to honor and preserve the memories of the survivors?&quot;

Seven of his films have been inducted into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;: &quot;Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T., Jurassic Park, Schindler&#x27;s List,&quot; and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;.

<doc id="26941" wikidata="Q51566" url="?curid=26941" title="Spike Lee">
<text>Shelton Jackson &quot;Spike&quot; Lee (born March 20, 1957) is an American film director, producer, screenwriter, actor, and author. His work has continually explored race relations, issues within the black community, the role of media in contemporary life, urban crime and poverty, and other political issues. Lee has won numerous accolades for his work, including an Academy Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards, a BAFTA Award, and two Peabody Awards. He has also been honored with an Honorary BAFTA Award in 2002, an Honorary César in 2003, and the Academy Honorary Award in 2015.

Lee&#x27;s films &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;, &quot;Bamboozled&quot;, &quot;Malcolm X&quot;, &quot;4 Little Girls&quot;, and &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot; were each selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. He has received a Gala Tribute from the Film Society of Lincoln Center as well as the Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize.

== Early life and education ==
Shelton Jackson Lee was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Jacqueline Carroll ( Shelton), a teacher of arts and black literature, and William James Edward Lee III, a jazz musician and composer. Lee has five younger siblings, three of whom (Joie, David, and Cinqué) have worked in many different positions in Lee&#x27;s films; a fourth, Christopher, died in 2014. His youngest sibling is half-brother Arnold. Director Malcolm D. Lee is his cousin. When he was a child, the family moved from Atlanta to Brooklyn, New York. His mother nicknamed him &quot;Spike&quot; during his childhood. He attended John Dewey High School in Brooklyn&#x27;s Gravesend neighborhood.

Lee enrolled in Morehouse College, a historically black college in Atlanta, where he made his first student film, &quot;Last Hustle in Brooklyn&quot;. He took film courses at Clark Atlanta University and graduated with a B.A. in mass communication from Morehouse. He did graduate work at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts, where he earned a Master of Fine Arts in film and television.

== Career ==

=== 1980s ===
In 1983, Lee premiered his first independent short film titled, &quot;Joe&#x27;s Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads&quot;. Lee submitted the film as his master&#x27;s degree thesis at the Tisch School of the Arts. Lee&#x27;s classmates Ang Lee and Ernest R. Dickerson worked on the film as assistant director and cinematographer, respectively. The film was the first student film to be showcased in Lincoln Center&#x27;s New Directors New Films Festival. Lee&#x27;s father, Bill Lee, composed the score. The film won a Student Academy Award.

In 1985, Lee began work on his first feature film, &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot;. The black-and-white film concerns a young woman (played by Tracy Camilla Johns) who is seeing three men, and the feelings this arrangement provokes. The film was Lee&#x27;s first feature-length film, and launched Lee&#x27;s career. Lee wrote, directed, produced, starred and edited the film with a budget of $175,000, he shot the film in two weeks. When the film was released in 1986, it grossed over $7 million at the U.S. box office. &quot;New York Times&quot; film critic A.O. Scott wrote that the film &quot;ushered in (along with Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Stranger Than Paradise&quot;) the American independent film movement of the 1980s. It was also a groundbreaking film for African-American filmmakers and a welcome change in the representation of blacks in American cinema, depicting men and women of color not as pimps and whores, but as intelligent, upscale urbanites.&quot; He followed this with the musical drama &quot;School Daze&quot; (1988).

In 1989, Lee made perhaps his most seminal film, &quot;Do the Right Thing,&quot; which focused on a Brooklyn neighborhood&#x27;s simmering racial tension on a hot summer day. The film&#x27;s cast included Lee, Danny Aiello, Bill Nunn, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Giancarlo Esposito, Rosie Perez, John Turturro, Martin Lawrence and Samuel L. Jackson. The film gained critical acclaim as one of the best films of the year from film critics including both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert who ranked the film as the best of 1989, and later in their top 10 films of the decade ( for Siskel and for Ebert). Ebert later added the film to his list of &quot;The Great Movies&quot;.

To many people&#x27;s surprise, the film was not nominated for Best Picture or Best Director at the Academy Awards. The film only earned two Academy Award nominations for Best Original Screenplay, Spike Lee&#x27;s first Oscar nomination, and for Best Supporting Actor for Danny Aiello. At the Academy ceremony Kim Basinger, who was a presenter that evening, stated that &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; also deserved a Best Picture nomination stating, &quot;We&#x27;ve got five great films here, and they are great for one reason, because they tell the truth, but there is one film missing from this list because ironically it might tell the biggest truth of all and that&#x27;s &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;&quot;. The film that did win Best Picture was &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;, a film that focused on race relations between an elderly Jewish woman (Jessica Tandy) and her driver (Morgan Freeman). Lee said in an April 7, 2006, interview with &quot;New York&quot; magazine that the other film&#x27;s success, which he thought was based on safe stereotypes, hurt him more than if his film had not been nominated for an award.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, Lee had his first collaboration with Denzel Washington in &quot;Mo&#x27; Better Blues&quot;. After the release of &quot;Mo&#x27; Better Blues&quot;, Lee was accused of antisemitism by the Anti-Defamation League and several film critics. They criticized the characters of the club owners Josh and Moe Flatbush, described as &quot;Shylocks&quot;. Lee denied the charge, explaining that he wrote those characters in order to depict how black artists struggled against exploitation. Lee said that Lew Wasserman, Sidney Sheinberg, or Tom Pollock, the Jewish heads of MCA and Universal Studios, were unlikely to allow antisemitic content in a film they produced. He said he could not make an antisemitic film because Jews run Hollywood, and &quot;that&#x27;s a fact&quot;. His next film was &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; (1991), for which Samuel L. Jackson won acclaim for his performance as a crack addict.

In 1992, Spike released his biographical epic film &quot;Malcolm X&quot; based on the &quot;Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot;, starring Denzel Washington as the famed civil rights leader. The film dramatizes key events in Malcolm X&#x27;s life: his criminal career, his incarceration, his conversion to Islam, his ministry as a member of the Nation of Islam and his later falling out with the organization, his marriage to Betty X, his pilgrimage to Mecca and reevaluation of his views concerning whites, and his assassination on February 21, 1965. Defining childhood incidents, including his father&#x27;s death, his mother&#x27;s mental illness, and his experiences with racism are dramatized in flashbacks. The film received widespread critical acclaim including from critic Roger Ebert ranked the film No. 1 on his Top 10 list for 1992 and described the film as &quot;one of the great screen biographies, celebrating the sweep of an American life that bottomed out in prison before its hero reinvented himself.&quot; Ebert and Martin Scorsese, who was sitting in for late &quot;At the Movies&quot; co-host Gene Siskel, both ranked &quot;Malcolm X&quot; among the ten best films of the 1990s. Denzel Washington&#x27;s portrayal of Malcolm X in particular was widely praised and he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor. Washington lost to Al Pacino (&quot;Scent of a Woman&quot;), a decision which Lee criticized, saying &quot;I&#x27;m not the only one who thinks Denzel was robbed on that one.&quot;
He followed &quot;Malcolm X&quot; with &quot;Crooklyn&quot; (1994), &quot;Clockers&quot; (1995), and &quot;Girl 6&quot; and &quot;Get on the Bus&quot; (both 1996). His 1997 documentary &quot;4 Little Girls&quot;, about the girls killed in the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1963, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Feature Documentary. In 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. He had his third collaboration with Denzel Washington on the sports drama &quot;He Got Game&quot; (1998). He followed this with &quot;Summer of Sam&quot; (1999), based on the Son of Sam murders.

=== 2000s ===
In 2000, Lee directed &quot;Bamboozled&quot; (2000), a satire about a modern televised minstrel show. He followed this with &quot;25th Hour&quot; (2002) starring Edward Norton and Philip Seymour Hoffman which opened to positive reviews, with several critics since having named it one of the best films of its decade. Film critic Roger Ebert added the film to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list on December 16, 2009. A. O. Scott, Richard Roeper and Roger Ebert all put it on their &quot;best films of the decade&quot; lists. It was later named the 26th greatest film since 2000 in a BBC poll of 177 critics. The film was also a financial success earning almost $24 million against a $5 million budget. He followed &quot;25th Hour&quot; with &quot;She Hate Me&quot; (2004), which received negative reviews.

In 2006, Lee directed &quot;Inside Man&quot; starring Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Clive Owen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer. The film was an unusual film for Lee considering it was a studio heist thriller. The film was a critical and financial success earning $186 million off a $45 million budget. &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film four stars out of five, concluding, &quot;It&#x27;s certainly a Spike Lee film, but no Spike Lee Joint. Still, he&#x27;s delivered a pacy, vigorous and frequently masterful take on a well-worn genre. Thanks to some slick lens work and a cast on cracking form, Lee proves (perhaps above all to himself?) that playing it straight is not always a bad thing.&quot;

On May 2, 2007, the 50th San Francisco International Film Festival honored Spike Lee with the San Francisco Film Society&#x27;s Directing Award. In 2008, he received the Wexner Prize. The same year, Lee directed the World War II drama &quot;Miracle at St. Anna&quot;.

=== 2010s ===
In 2012, Lee directed &quot;Red Hook Summer&quot;, in which he reprised his role as Mookie from &quot;Do the Right Thing.&quot; In 2013, Lee won The Dorothy and Lillian Gish Prize, one of the richest prizes in the American arts worth $300,000. The same year, he directed &quot;Oldboy&quot;, a remake of the Park Chan-wook 2003 film, which was reportedly taken away from Lee in the editing room, leading him to remove his trademark &quot;A Spike Lee Joint&quot; credit for a more impersonal &quot;A Spike Lee Film&quot;. He followed this with &quot;Da Sweet Blood of Jesus&quot; (2014), which was primarily funded on Kickstarter.

In 2015, Lee received an Academy Honorary Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for his contributions to film. Friends and frequent collaborators Wesley Snipes, Denzel Washington, and Samuel L. Jackson presented Lee with the award at the private Governors Awards ceremony. Lee directed, wrote, and produced the MyCareer story mode in the video game &quot;NBA 2K16&quot;. Later that same year, after a perceived long dip in quality, Lee rebounded with a musical drama film, &quot;Chi-Raq&quot;. The film is a modern-day adaptation of the ancient Greek play &quot;Lysistrata&quot; by Aristophanes set in modern-day Chicago&#x27;s Southside and explores the challenges of race, sex, and violence in America. Teyonah Parris, Angela Bassett, Jennifer Hudson, Nick Cannon, Dave Chappelle, Wesley Snipes, John Cusack, and Samuel L. Jackson starred in the film. The film was released by Amazon Studios in select cities in November. &quot;Chi-Raq&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has rating of 82% with the site&#x27;s critical consensus stating, &quot;&quot;Chi-Raq&quot; is as urgently topical and satisfyingly ambitious as it is wildly uneven – and it contains some of Spike Lee&#x27;s smartest, sharpest, and all-around entertaining late-period work.&quot;
Lee&#x27;s 2018 film &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot;, a true crime drama set in the 1970s centered around the true story of a black police officer, Ron Stallworth, infiltrating the Ku Klux Klan. The film premiered at the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Grand Prix and opened the following August. The film received near universal praise when it opened in North America receiving a 96% on Rotten Tomatoes with the critics consensus reading, &quot;&quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot; uses history to offer bitingly trenchant commentary on current events – and brings out some of Spike Lee&#x27;s hardest-hitting work in decades along the way.&quot; In 2019, during the awards season leading up to the Academy Awards, Lee was invited to join a Directors Roundtable conversation run by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. The roundtable included Ryan Coogler (&quot;Black Panther&quot;), Yorgos Lanthimos (&quot;The Favourite&quot;), Alfonso Cuarón (&quot;Roma&quot;), Marielle Heller (&quot;Can You Ever Forgive Me?&quot;), and Bradley Cooper (&quot;A Star is Born&quot;). It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and Best Director (Lee&#x27;s first ever nomination in this category). Lee won his first competitive Academy Award in the category Best Adapted Screenplay. When asked by journalists from the BBC if the Best Picture winner &quot;Green Book&quot; offended him, Lee replied, &quot;Let me give you a British answer, it&#x27;s not my cup of tea&quot;. Many journalists in the industry noted how the 2019 Oscars with &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot; competing against eventual winner &quot;Green Book&quot; mirrored the 1989 Oscars with Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; missing out on a Best Picture nomination over the eventual winner &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;.

=== 2020s ===
Lee&#x27;s Vietnam war film &quot;Da 5 Bloods&quot; was released on Netflix. The film starred Delroy Lindo, Jonathan Majors, Clarke Peters, Isiah Whitlock Jr., Mélanie Thierry, Paul Walter Hauser and Chadwick Boseman. The film was released worldwide on June 12, 2020. The film&#x27;s plot follows a group of aging Vietnam War veterans who return to the country in search of the remains of their fallen squad leader, as well as the treasure they buried while serving there. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was scheduled to premiere out-of-competition at the 2020 Cannes Film Festival, then play in theaters in May or June before streaming on Netflix. The film received widespread critical acclaim; the website Rotten Tomatoes gave it an approval rating of 92% based on 252 reviews, with the critical consensus reading: &quot;Fierce energy and ambition course through &quot;Da 5 Bloods&quot;, coming together to fuel one of Spike Lee&#x27;s most urgent and impactful films.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Lee has been linked to a movie musical about the origin story of Viagra, Pfizer&#x27;s erectile dysfunction drug. He signed a deal with Netflix to direct and produce more movies. In February 2024, it was announced that Spike Lee was confirmed as the director of &quot;Highest 2 Lowest&quot;, a remake of &quot;High and Low&quot; (1963) originally directed by Akira Kurosawa, with Denzel Washington to star.

== Academic career and teaching ==
In 1991, Lee taught a course at Harvard about filmmaking. In 1993, he began to teach at New York University&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts in the Graduate Film Program. It was there that he received his master of fine arts. In 2002, he was appointed as artistic director of the school. He is now a tenured professor at NYU.

== Commercials ==
In mid-1990, Levi&#x27;s hired Lee to direct a series of TV commercials for their 501 button-fly jeans. Marketing executives from Nike offered Lee a job directing commercials for the company. They wanted to pair Lee&#x27;s character, Mars Blackmon, who greatly admired athlete Michael Jordan, and Jordan in a marketing campaign for the Air Jordan line. Later, Lee was asked to comment on the phenomenon of violence related to inner-city youths trying to steal Air Jordans from other kids. He said that, rather than blaming manufacturers of apparel that gained popularity, &quot;deal with the conditions that make a kid put so much importance on a pair of sneakers, a jacket and gold&quot;. Through the marketing wing of 40 Acres and a Mule, Lee has directed commercials for Converse, Jaguar, Taco Bell, and Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s.

== Artistic style and themes ==

Lee&#x27;s films are typically referred to as &quot;Spike Lee Joints&quot;. The closing credits always end with the phrases &quot;By Any Means Necessary&quot;, &quot;Ya Dig&quot;, and &quot;Sho Nuff&quot;. His 2013 film, &quot;Oldboy&quot;, used the traditional &quot;A Spike Lee Film&quot; credit after producers had it re-edited.

=== Themes ===
Lee&#x27;s films have examined race relations, colorism in the black community, the role of media in contemporary life, urban crime and poverty, and other political issues. His films are also noted for their unique stylistic elements, including the use of dolly shots to portray the characters &quot;floating&quot; through their surroundings, which he has had his cinematographers repeatedly use in his work.

=== Influences ===
In 2018, during an interview with &quot;GQ&quot;, Lee cited some of his favorite films as Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954) and &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957), as well as Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Mean Streets&quot; (1973). Lee says that he befriended Scorsese after attending a screening of &quot;After Hours&quot; at NYU.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriage ===
Lee met his wife, attorney Tonya Lewis Lee, in 1992, and they were married a year later in New York. They have two children.

When asked by the BBC whether he believed in God, Lee said: &quot;Yes. I have faith that there is a higher being. All this cannot be an accident.&quot; Lee continues to maintain an office in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, but he and his wife live on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

=== Sports ===
Spike Lee is a fan of the New York Knicks basketball team, the New York Yankees baseball team (although he grew up a New York Mets fan), the New York Rangers ice hockey team, and the English football club Arsenal. One of the documentaries in ESPN&#x27;s &quot;30 for 30&quot; series, &quot;Winning Time: Reggie Miller vs. The New York Knicks&quot;, focuses partly on Lee&#x27;s interaction with Miller at Knicks games in Madison Square Garden. In June 2003, Lee sought an injunction against Spike TV to prevent them from using his nickname; he claimed that because of his fame, viewers would think he was associated with the channel. In March 2020, Lee and the security team at Madison Square Garden had a disagreement over which entrance to use to see the New York Knicks; Lee stated he would not attend the rest of the games for the season. Spike Lee has also frequented New York Liberty games at Barclays Center, sitting courtside during the 2024 WNBA playoffs in a Sabrina Ionescu Jersey

=== Politics ===

In May 1999, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Lee made an inflammatory comment about Charlton Heston, president of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), while speaking to reporters at the Cannes Film Festival. Lee was quoted as saying the National Rifle Association should be disbanded and, of Heston, someone should &quot;Shoot him with a .44 Bull Dog.&quot; Lee said he intended it as a joke. He was responding to coverage about whether Hollywood was responsible for school shootings. &quot;The problem is guns&quot;, he said. Republican House Majority Leader Dick Armey condemned Lee as having &quot;nothing to offer the debate on school violence except more violence and more hate&quot;.

In October 2005, Lee responded to a CNN anchor&#x27;s question as to whether the government intentionally ignored the plight of black Americans during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina catastrophe by saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not too far-fetched. I don&#x27;t put anything past the United States government. I don&#x27;t find it too far-fetched that they tried to displace all the black people out of New Orleans.&quot; In later comments, Lee cited the government&#x27;s past including the Tuskegee Syphilis Study.

In May 2020, Lee published a three-minute short film, &quot;NEW YORK NEW YORK&quot;, on Instagram that was later featured on the city&#x27;s official website. Lee celebrated Joe Biden&#x27;s victory over Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election with champagne amid a crowd on the streets of Brooklyn. Lee endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 United States presidential election and spoke at one of her campaign rallies on October 24, 2024.

=== Legal issues ===
In March 2012, after the killing of Trayvon Martin, Spike Lee was one of many people who used Twitter to circulate a message that claimed to give the home address of the shooter George Zimmerman. The address turned out to be incorrect, causing the real occupants, Elaine and David McClain, to leave home and stay at a hotel due to numerous death threats. Lee issued an apology and reached an agreement with the McClains, which reportedly included &quot;compensation&quot;, with their attorney stating &quot;The McClains&#x27; claim is fully resolved&quot;. Nevertheless, in November 2013, the McClains filed a negligence lawsuit which accused Lee of &quot;encouraging a dangerous mob mentality among his Twitter followers, as well as the public-at-large&quot;. The lawsuit, which a court filing reportedly valued at $1.2 million, alleged that the couple suffered &quot;injuries and damages&quot; that continued after the initial settlement up through Zimmerman&#x27;s trial in 2013. A Seminole County judge dismissed the McClains&#x27; suit, agreeing with Lee that the issue had already been settled previously.

== Controversies ==
At the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, Lee, who was then making &quot;Miracle at St. Anna,&quot; about an all-black U.S. division fighting in Italy during World War II, criticized director Clint Eastwood for not depicting black Marines in his own World War II film, &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;. Citing historical accuracy, Eastwood responded that his film was specifically about the Marines who raised the flag on Mount Suribachi at Iwo Jima, pointing out that while black Marines did fight at Iwo Jima, the U.S. military was racially segregated during World War II, and none of the men who raised the flag were black. He angrily said that Lee should &quot;shut his face&quot;. Lee responded that Eastwood was acting like an &quot;angry old man&quot;, and argued that despite making two Iwo Jima films back to back, &quot;Letters from Iwo Jima&quot; and &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;, &quot;there was not one black soldier in both of those films&quot;. He added that he and Eastwood were &quot;not on a plantation&quot;. Lee later claimed that the event was exaggerated by the media and that he and Eastwood had reconciled through mutual friend Steven Spielberg, culminating in his sending Eastwood a print of &quot;Miracle at St. Anna&quot;.

Lee has been criticized for his representation of women. For example, bell hooks said that he wrote black women in the same objectifying way that white male filmmakers write the characters of white women. Rosie Perez, who was in an acting role for the first time as Tina in &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;, said later that she was very uncomfortable with doing the nude scene in the film, saying, &quot;I had a big problem with it, mainly because I was afraid of what my family would think...It wasn&#x27;t really about taking off my clothes. But I also didn&#x27;t feel good about it because the atmosphere wasn&#x27;t correct.&quot; Subsequently, Perez stated that Lee had offered an apology, and the two maintained their friendship.

Over the course of his career Spike Lee has defended Woody Allen, Michael Jackson and Nate Parker, all of whom have been accused of sexual misconduct.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1983, Lee won the Student Academy Award for his film &quot;Joe&#x27;s Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We Cut Heads&quot;. He won awards at the Black Reel Awards for &quot;Love and Basketball&quot;, the Black Movie Awards for &quot;Inside Man&quot;, and the Berlin International Film Festival for &quot;Get on the Bus&quot;. He won BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay for &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot;.

Lee was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Original Screenplay for &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; and Best Documentary for &quot;4 Little Girls&quot;, but did not win either award. In November 2015, he was given the Academy Honorary Award for his contributions to filmmaking. In 2019, he received his first Best Picture and Best Director nominations.

In 2015, at the age of 58, Lee became the youngest person ever to receive an Honorary Academy Award. Lee received the award as &quot;a champion of independent film and an inspiration to young filmmakers&quot;. Frequent collaborators Denzel Washington, Samuel L. Jackson, and Wesley Snipes presented Lee with the award at a private ceremony at the Governors Awards.

In 2019, Lee&#x27;s film &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot; went on to receive 6 Academy Award nominations. Lee himself was nominated for 3 Oscars for Lee for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay. He went on to win the Best Adapted Screenplay, his first Academy Award.

Two of his films have competed for the Palme d&#x27;Or award at the Cannes Film Festival, and of the two, &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot; won the Grand Prix in 2018.

Lee&#x27;s films &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;, &quot;Malcolm X&quot;, &quot;4 Little Girls&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s Gotta Have It&quot;, and &quot;Bamboozled&quot; were each selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

On May 18, 2016, Lee delivered the Commencement address for The Johns Hopkins University Class of 2016.

He has been named as the recipient of the Ebert Director Award at the TIFF Tribute Awards for the 2023 Toronto International Film Festival.

In March 2024, Lee received a Board of Governor&#x27;s Award from the American Society of Cinematographers.

<doc id="26942" wikidata="Q259913" url="?curid=26942" title="Spike Jonze">
<text>Adam Spiegel (born October 22, 1969), known professionally as Spike Jonze (), is an American filmmaker, actor, musician, and photographer. His work includes films, commercials, music videos, skateboard videos and television.

Jonze began his career as a teenager photographing BMX riders and skateboarders for &quot;Freestylin&#x27; Magazine&quot; and &quot;Transworld Skateboarding&quot;, and co-founding the youth culture magazine &quot;Dirt&quot;. Moving into filmmaking, he began shooting street skateboarding films, including the influential &quot;Video Days&quot; (1991). Jonze co-founded the skateboard company Girl Skateboards in 1993 with riders Rick Howard and Mike Carroll. Jonze&#x27;s filmmaking style made him an in-demand director of music videos for much of the 1990s, resulting in collaborations with R.E.M., Sonic Youth, Beastie Boys, Ween, Fatboy Slim, Daft Punk, Weezer, Björk, Arcade Fire and Kanye West.

Jonze began his feature film directing career with &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; (1999) and &quot;Adaptation&quot; (2002), both written by Charlie Kaufman; the former earned Jonze an Academy Award nomination for Best Director. He was a co-creator and executive producer of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Jackass&quot; reality franchise. Jonze later began directing films based on his own screenplays, including &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; (2009) and &quot;Her&quot; (2013); for the latter film, he won the Academy Award, Golden Globe, and the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay, while receiving Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Original Song (&quot;The Moon Song&quot;).

He has worked as an actor sporadically throughout his career, co-starring in David O. Russell&#x27;s war comedy &quot;Three Kings&quot; (1999) and appearing in supporting roles in Bennett Miller&#x27;s &quot;Moneyball&quot; (2011) and Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; (2013), in addition to a recurring role in comedy series &quot;The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret&quot; (2010–2012) and cameo appearances in his own films. Jonze co-founded Directors Label, with filmmakers Chris Cunningham and Michel Gondry, and the Palm Pictures company. He is currently the creative director of Vice Media, Inc. and its multinational television channel Vice TV.

==Early life and education==
Adam Spiegel was born on October 22, 1969, in New York City, the son of Arthur H. Spiegel III and Sandra L. Granzow. His father was of German Jewish ancestry. Jonze is the great-grandson of Arthur Spiegel and the great-great-grandson of Joseph Spiegel, founder of the Spiegel catalog. Arthur H. Spiegel III was the founder of a healthcare consulting firm. Jonze&#x27;s parents divorced when he was a young child and his father remarried. Jonze was raised by his mother in Bethesda, Maryland, where she worked in public relations, along with his brother Sam &quot;Squeak E. Clean&quot; Spiegel, who is now a producer and DJ, and his sister Julia. While studying at Walt Whitman High School, Jonze spent much of his time at a Bethesda community store, where owner Mike Henderson gave him the nickname &quot;Spike Jonze&quot; in reference to the satirical bandleader Spike Jones. While in high school, Jonze was close friends with future Jackass co-creator Jeff Tremaine. They became friends through their shared interest in BMX.

A keen BMX rider, Jonze began working at the Rockville BMX store in Rockville, Maryland, at the age of 16. A common destination for touring professional BMX teams, Jonze began photographing BMX demos at Rockville and formed a friendship with &quot;Freestylin&#x27; Magazine&quot; editors Mark Lewman and Andy Jenkins. Impressed with Jonze&#x27;s photography work, the pair offered him a job as a photographer for the magazine, and he subsequently moved to California to pursue career opportunities in photography. Jonze fronted &quot;Club Homeboy&quot;, an international BMX club, alongside Lewman and Jenkins. The three also created the youth culture magazines &quot;Homeboy&quot; and &quot;Dirt&quot;, the latter of which was spun off from the female-centered &quot;Sassy&quot; and was aimed towards young boys.

==Career==
===1985–1993: Photography, magazines, and early video work===
While shooting for various BMX publications in California, Jonze was introduced to a number of professional skateboarders who often shared ramps with BMX pros. Jonze formed a close friendship with Mark Gonzales, co-owner of the newly formed Blind Skateboards at the time, and began shooting photos with the young Blind team including Jason Lee, Guy Mariano and Rudy Johnson in the late 1980s. Jonze became a regular contributor to &quot;Transworld Skateboarding&quot; and was subsequently given a job at World Industries by Steve Rocco, who enlisted him to photograph advertisements and shoot promotional videos for his brands under the World Industries umbrella. Jonze filmed, edited and produced his first skateboarding video, &quot;Rubbish Heap&quot;, for World Industries in 1989. His following video project was &quot;Video Days&quot;, a promotional video for Blind Skateboards, which was released in 1991 and is considered to be highly influential in the community. The video&#x27;s subject, Gonzales, presented a copy of &quot;Video Days&quot; to Kim Gordon during a chance encounter following a Sonic Youth show in early 1992. Impressed with Jonze&#x27;s videography skills, Gordon asked him to direct a music video featuring skateboarders. The video, co-directed by Jonze and Tamra Davis, was for their 1992 single &quot;100%&quot;, which featured skateboarding footage of Blind Skateboards rider Jason Lee, who later became a successful actor. In 1993, Jonze co-directed the &quot;trippy&quot; music video for The Breeders song &quot;Cannonball&quot; with Gordon.

Along with Rick Howard and Mike Carroll, Jonze co-founded the skateboard company Girl Skateboards in 1993. The following year, he directed the video for the Weezer song &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;, which featured the band performing the song interspersed with clips from the sitcom &quot;Happy Days&quot;. The video became immensely popular and was shown frequently on MTV. A 2013 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers&#x27; poll ranked it as the tenth best music video of the 1990s. Also in 1994, Jonze directed the videos for the Beastie Boys&#x27; songs &quot;Sure Shot&quot; and, more famously, &quot;Sabotage&quot;. The latter parodies 1970s cop shows and is presented as the opening credits for a fictional show called &quot;Sabotage&quot;, featuring the band members appearing as its protagonists. As with &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;, the video attracted great popularity and was in &quot;near-constant rotation on MTV.&quot; In the same year, Jonze also directed videos for the hip hop group Marxman, The Breeders, Dinosaur Jr., and another Weezer song, &quot;Undone – The Sweater Song&quot;. Jonze made his film debut as an actor in a bit part in the drama &quot;Mi Vida Loca&quot; (1994). In 1995, he was attached to direct an adapatation of &quot;Harold and the Purple Crayon&quot;.

=== 1995–1999: In demand video director and &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; ===
Jonze collaborated with Björk for the video for her 1995 single &quot;It&#x27;s Oh So Quiet&quot;, a cover of a 1951 Betty Hutton song. The video is set in an auto shop and sees Björk dancing and singing to the song in the style of a musical, inspired by Jacques Demy&#x27;s &quot;The Umbrellas of Cherbourg&quot;. In the same year, he also directed a television commercial titled &quot;Guerrilla Tennis&quot; for Nike featuring tennis players Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras participating in a match in the middle of an intersection in Manhattan, the &quot;rapid-paced&quot; title sequence for the sitcom &quot;Double Rush&quot; and worked on videos for R.E.M., Sonic Youth and Ween. Jonze sole video directing credit of 1996 was for The Pharcyde&#x27;s &quot;Drop&quot;, which was filmed backwards and then reversed. In 1997, Jonze made a short film called &quot;How They Get There&quot;, starring Mark Gonzales as a man who is playfully imitating a woman&#x27;s actions on the other side of a sidewalk before running into danger. Jonze worked with the electronic music duo Daft Punk on the music video for the instrumental song &quot;Da Funk&quot; in 1997. The clip, titled &quot;Big City Nights&quot;, follows an anthropomorphic &quot;man-dog&quot; wandering the streets of New York City. His video for the Chemical Brothers&#x27;s &quot;Elektrobank&quot; (1997) starred his future wife Sofia Coppola as a gymnast. Throughout 1997, he also worked on videos for R.E.M., Pavement, Puff Daddy, and The Notorious B.I.G. He made a cameo appearance as a paramedic in David Fincher&#x27;s film &quot;The Game&quot; (1997).

Jonze filmed a short documentary in 1997, &quot;Amarillo by Morning&quot;, about two Texan boys who aspire to be bull riders. He was also one of the cinematographers for the documentary &quot;Free Tibet&quot;, which documents the 1996 Tibetan Freedom Concert in San Francisco. His 1998 commercial for Sprite is considered an example of subvertising for its spoof take on the brand&#x27;s mascot. Jonze developed an alter ego named Richard Koufey, the leader of the Torrance Community Dance Group, an urban troupe that performs in public spaces. The Koufey persona appeared when Jonze, in character, filmed himself dancing to Fatboy Slim&#x27;s &quot;Praise You&quot; as it played on a boom box in a public area. Jonze showed the video to Slim, who appears briefly in the video. Jonze then assembled a group of dancers to perform to Slim&#x27;s &quot;Praise You&quot; outside a Westwood, California, movie theater and taped the performance. The resulting clip was a huge success, and &quot;Koufey&quot; and his troupe were invited to New York City to perform the song for the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards. The video received awards for Best Direction, Breakthrough, and Best Choreography, which Jonze accepted, still in character. Jonze made a short mockumentary about the experience called &quot;Torrance Rises&quot; (1999).

The first feature film Jonze directed was &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; in 1999. It stars John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, and Catherine Keener, with John Malkovich as himself. The screenplay was written by Charlie Kaufman and follows a puppeteer who finds a portal in an office that leads to the mind of actor John Malkovich. Kaufman&#x27;s script was passed on to Jonze by his father-in-law Francis Ford Coppola and he agreed to direct it, &quot;delighted by its originality and labyrinthine plot&quot;. &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; was released in October 1999 to laudatory reviews; the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; critic Roger Ebert found the film to be &quot;endlessly inventive&quot; and named it the best film of 1999, while Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called it the &quot;most excitingly original movie of the year&quot;. At the 72nd Academy Awards, the film was nominated for Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Keener. Jonze co-starred opposite George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube in David O. Russell&#x27;s war comedy &quot;Three Kings&quot; (1999), which depicts a gold heist by four U.S. soldiers following the end of the Gulf War. Jonze&#x27;s role in the film, the sweet, dimwitted, casually racist PFC Conrad Vig, was written specifically for him. Jonze also directed a commercial for Nike called &quot;The Morning After&quot; in 1999, a parody of the hysteria surrounding Y2K.

=== 2000–2008: &quot;Adaptation&quot; and &quot;Jackass&quot; ===
Jonze returned to video directing in 2000, helming the video for the song &quot;Wonderboy&quot; by the comedy duo Tenacious D. Along with Johnny Knoxville and childhood friend Jeff Tremaine, Jonze co-created, executive produced and occasionally appeared in the television series &quot;Jackass&quot; in 2000, which aired on MTV for three seasons until 2002. The show featured a group of people performing dangerous stunts and pranks on each other. At the request of Al Gore&#x27;s presidential campaign in 2000, Jonze directed a short video about Gore at his home. The video was shown at the Democratic National Convention. He collaborated with Fatboy Slim for a second a time in 2001, directing the video for &quot;Weapon of Choice&quot;, starring Christopher Walken dancing around a deserted hotel lobby. The video won multiple awards at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards and the 2002 Grammy Award for Best Music Video. Jonze&#x27;s second film, the comedy-drama &quot;Adaptation,&quot; (2002), was partially based on the non-fiction book &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot; by Susan Orlean and was written by Charlie Kaufman. The metafilm starred Nicolas Cage in a dual role as Kaufman and his fictional twin brother, Donald, as he attempts to adapt &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot; into a film and features dramatized events from the book. It co-starred Meryl Streep as Orlean and Chris Cooper as the subject of &quot;The Orchid Thief&quot;, John Laroche. &quot;Adaptation.&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim from critics, who praised it for its originality whilst simultaneously being funny and thought-provoking.
&quot;&quot;, a continuation of the television show, was released in October 2002. Jonze co-produced, contributed to the writing of the segments, and made a cameo appearance in the film. Jonze directed a 60-second commercial called &quot;Lamp&quot; for the furniture store IKEA in 2002, which won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions International Advertising Festival, considered a prestigious award in the field of advertising. Also in 2002, Jonze directed the Levi&#x27;s commercial &quot;Crazy Legs&quot; and the videos for Beck&#x27;s &quot;Guess I&#x27;m Doing Fine&quot;, Björk&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s in Our Hands&quot; (filmed in night vision), and one of two versions of Weezer&#x27;s &quot;Island in the Sun&quot;. Jonze co-directed the Girl Skateboards video &quot;Yeah Right!&quot; in 2003, which featured extensive use of special effects and a cameo by Owen Wilson. That same year, he directed the video for Turbonegro&#x27;s single &quot;Sell Your Body (to the Night)&quot; which featured appearances by the members of Jackass.

Jonze co-founded &quot;Directors Label&quot; – a series of DVDs devoted to music video directors – in September 2003 with filmmakers Chris Cunningham and Michel Gondry. Jonze&#x27;s volume, &quot;The Work of Director Spike Jonze&quot;, was released in October and comprises his videos, as well as photographs, drawings and interviews. Jonze made a faux documentary called &quot;The Mystery of Dalarö&quot; in 2004 as part of an advertising campaign for the Volvo S40. The film was credited to a fictional Venezuelan director named Carlos Soto, but was later revealed to have been directed by Jonze. He directed a commercial for Adidas titled &quot;Hello Tomorrow&quot; in 2005, featuring the music of his brother Sam &quot;Squeak E. Clean&quot; Spiegel and Jonze&#x27;s then-girlfriend Karen O of the band Yeah Yeah Yeahs.

After directing videos for Ludacris and Yeah Yeah Yeahs&#x27; &quot;Y Control&quot; (which caused some controversy over its graphic images), Jonze collaborated with Björk for a third time on the playful music video for &quot;Triumph of a Heart&quot; (2005), in which her husband was played by a housecat. The second &quot;Jackass&quot; film, &quot;Jackass Number Two&quot;, was released in 2006 and saw Jonze dress as an old lady whose breasts &quot;accidentally&quot; keep becoming exposed while wandering around Los Angeles. Along with Dave Eggers, he had a speaking part in the Beck song &quot;The Horrible Fanfare/Landslide/Exoskeleton&quot; from his 2006 album &quot;The Information&quot;. In 2007, he became the creative director of VBS.tv, an online television network supplied by Vice and funded by MTV. Jonze hosted his own interview show on the service. He directed ads for GAP and Levi&#x27;s, and co-directed the skateboarding video &quot;Fully Flared&quot; with Ty Evans and Cory Weincheque in the same year. Jonze directed the music video for Kanye West&#x27;s single &quot;Flashing Lights&quot; in 2008. Filmed entirely in slow motion, the video stars West and model Rita G, and sees her driving around the Las Vegas, Nevada, desert in a Ford Mustang before stopping to repeatedly stab West, who is tied up in the trunk. Jonze produced Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; in 2008, which Jonze originally intended to direct.

=== 2009–2019: &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot;, short films, and &quot;Her&quot; ===
&quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; (2009), a film adaptation of Maurice Sendak children&#x27;s picture book of the same name, was directed by Jonze and co-written by Jonze and Dave Eggers, who expanded the original ten-sentence book into a feature film. Sendak gave advice to Jonze while he was adapting the book and the two developed a friendship. The film stars Max Records as Max, a lonely 8-year-old boy who runs away from home after an argument with his mother (played by Catherine Keener) and sails away to an island inhabited by creatures known as the &quot;Wild Things,&quot; who declare Max their king. The Wild Things were played by performers in creature suits, while CGI was required to animate their faces. James Gandolfini, Lauren Ambrose, Chris Cooper, Forest Whitaker, Catherine O&#x27;Hara, Paul Dano, and Michael Berry Jr. provided the voices for the Wild Things, and Jonze voiced two owls named Bob and Terry. The film&#x27;s soundtrack was performed by Karen O and composer Carter Burwell scored his third film for Jonze. &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; was released in October 2009 to a generally positive critical reception but did not perform well at the box office. Some reviewers were unsure whether the film was intended for a younger or adult audience due to its dark tone and level of maturity. Jonze himself said that he &quot;didn&#x27;t set out to make a children&#x27;s movie; I set out to make a movie about childhood&quot;. A television documentary, &quot;Tell Them Anything You Want: A Portrait of Maurice Sendak&quot;, co-directed by Jonze and Lance Bangs, aired in 2009 and features a series of interviews with Sendak. Jonze wrote and directed &quot;We Were Once a Fairytale&quot; (2009), a short film starring Kanye West as himself acting belligerently while drunk in a nightclub.

Jonze wrote and directed the science fiction romance short film &quot;I&#x27;m Here&quot; in 2010, based on the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Giving Tree&quot;. The film stars Andrew Garfield as a robot with a head shaped like an old PC who falls in love with a more sleekly-designed female robot, played by Sienna Guillory. Jonze produced and provided his voice to a character in the short film &quot;Higglety Pigglety Pop! or There Must Be More to Life&quot; (2010), based on Maurice Sendak&#x27;s book of the same name. He co-directed the video for LCD Soundsystem&#x27;s &quot;Drunk Girls&quot; with the band&#x27;s frontman James Murphy and directed the video for Arcade Fire&#x27;s &quot;The Suburbs&quot; in 2010, the latter being an edited version of Jonze&#x27;s short film &quot;Scenes from the Suburbs&quot; (2011), a dystopian vision of suburbia in the near-future and an expansion of the themes of nostalgia, alienation, and childhood found in the song. A third &quot;Jackass&quot; film, &quot;Jackass 3D&quot;, premiered in 2010. He was part of the main cast for the black comedy series &quot;The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret&quot; as the supervisor to David Cross&#x27; character for the first two seasons in 2010 and 2012, before being replaced by Jack McBrayer in the third season. Jonze resumed his longtime collaboration with the Beastie Boys in July 2011, directing the video for their song featuring Santigold, &quot;Don&#x27;t Play No Game That I Can&#x27;t Win&quot;, in which the band members are portrayed as action figures. He then directed the video for Kanye West and Jay-Z&#x27;s 2011 single &quot;Otis&quot;, which saw the pair driving a customized Maybach 57 around an industrial lot. Along with Simon Cahn, Jonze co-directed the stop-motion animated short film &quot;Mourir Auprès De Toi&quot; (2011), which is set in the Shakespeare and Company bookstore in Paris. Jonze voiced a skeletal Macbeth in the film. Also in 2011, Jonze played a small supporting role in the sports drama &quot;Moneyball&quot; as the husband of Robin Wright&#x27;s character, who is the ex-wife of Billy Beane (played by Brad Pitt). In 2012, Jonze co-directed the feature-length skateboarding film &quot;Pretty Sweet&quot; with his &quot;Fully Flared&quot; co-directors Ty Evans and Cory Weincheque.
Jonze&#x27;s fourth feature film, the romantic science fiction drama &quot;Her&quot;, was released in December 2013. The film was his first original screenplay and the first he had written alone, inspired by Charlie Kaufman by putting &quot;all the ideas and feelings at that time&quot; into his script for &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot;. It stars Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Rooney Mara, Olivia Wilde, and Scarlett Johansson. The film follows the recently divorced Theodore Twombly (Phoenix), a man who develops a relationship with a seemingly intuitive and humanistic female voice, named &quot;Samantha&quot; (Johansson), produced by an advanced computer operating system. Samantha was originally voiced by Samantha Morton during its production, but was later replaced by Johansson. Jonze provided his voice to a video game character in the film, Alien Child, who interacts with Theodore. The film&#x27;s score was composed by Arcade Fire and Owen Pallett.

&quot;Her&quot; was met with universal acclaim from critics. Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised Jonze for taking an old theme &quot;the search for love and the need to &#x27;only connect&#x27;&quot; and embracing it &quot;in a speculative way that feels very pertinent to the moment and captures the emotional malaise of a future just an intriguing step or two ahead of contemporary reality.&quot; Scott Foundas of &quot;Variety&quot; opined that it was Jonze&#x27;s &quot;richest and most emotionally mature work to date&quot;. At the 86th Academy Awards, Jonze was nominated for three Academy Awards for &quot;Her&quot;, winning for Best Original Screenplay and receiving further nominations for Best Picture and Best Original Song for co-writing &quot;The Moon Song&quot; with Karen O. Jonze won the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay at the 71st Golden Globe Awards.

Jonze co-wrote, co-produced, and appeared in &quot;Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa&quot; (2013), a hidden camera comedy film starring Johnny Knoxville as the vulgar grandfather Irvin Zisman. Jonze played his wife Gloria, but was cut from a majority of the film. Jonze served as the creative director of the YouTube Music Awards on November 3, 2013. At the ceremony, he directed the live music video for Arcade Fire&#x27;s &quot;Afterlife&quot;, documented Lady Gaga&#x27;s live performance of &quot;Dope&quot; with Chris Milk, and premiered a short film written by Lena Dunham that Jonze directed called &quot;Choose You&quot;. Jonze had a small role in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 2013 film &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; as a stockbroker who teaches Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) the ins and outs of penny stocks. Jonze got the part as the film shared the same casting director as &quot;Her&quot;, who asked Jonze if he wanted to appear in the film. He directed the video for Kanye West&#x27;s &quot;Only One&quot; in 2015, which was filmed on his iPhone in a foggy field and featured heartfelt interactions between West and daughter. Jonze made a guest appearance in the fourth season of Lena Dunham&#x27;s television series &quot;Girls&quot; in March 2015. Jonze directed the short commercial film &quot;Kenzo World&quot; to promote a fragrance by Kenzo in 2016. The film starred Margaret Qualley as a woman erratically dancing around a large mansion, with choreography by Ryan Heffington. Jonze is the creative director of multinational television channel brand Viceland, which launched in February 2016.

In 2017, Jonze directed Frank Ocean&#x27;s summer festival tour, which included 8 shows which took place in different cities around the US and Europe. Jonze also produced and decorated, alongside Ocean and artist Tom Sachs among others, an elaborate stage with a runway and central platform for the same concert. Jonze wrote and directed the stage show &quot;Changers: A Dance Story&quot;, starring Lakeith Stanfield and Mia Wasikowska. Featuring dance choreography by Ryan Heffington, the show premiered at an Opening Ceremony fashion week presentation in September 2017 before opening to the public for a four-night run at the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. Jonze produced the documentary &quot;Jim &amp; Andy: The Great Beyond&quot; (2017), which documents the production of the film &quot;Man on the Moon&quot; (1999). The following year, he directed the short commercial film &quot;Welcome Home&quot; for Apple&#x27;s HomePod devices, starring FKA Twigs dancing inside her apartment as its transforms into a surreal space and engages in a dance off with her doppelgänger. In 2019, Jonze directed a commercial and accompanying short film for the website building service Squarespace starring Idris Elba, as well a short film titled &quot;The New Normal&quot; advocating for marijuana legalization in partnership with the cannabis company MedMen. In that year, Jonze also filmed the Aziz Ansari stand-up special &quot;Right Now&quot;, operating close-up shots himself onstage. He won two consecutive Directors Guild of America Awards for his commercial work in 2018 and 2019.

=== 2020–present: &quot;Beastie Boys Story&quot; ===
Jonze directed the &quot;Beastie Boys Story: As Told by Michael Diamond &amp; Adam Horovitz&quot; stage show, which took place in Philadelphia and Brooklyn for three nights in 2019 and saw the band&#x27;s two surviving members tell the story of the Beastie Boys and their friendship. A feature-length documentary, &quot;Beastie Boys Story&quot;, was also directed by Jonze and features footage from the shows. It was released on Apple TV+ in 2020 to positive reviews. He returned to acting in Damien Chazelle&#x27;s 2022 film &quot;Babylon&quot;, appearing as a German film director bearing a resemblance to Erich von Stroheim.
In early 2023, it was reported that Jonze had started working on a television series for Netflix with Brad Pitt and Joaquin Phoenix attached. However, the project was scrapped after he left it in October 2024.

==Personal life==

On June 26, 1999, Jonze married director Sofia Coppola, whom he had first met in 1992 on the set of the music video for Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;100%&quot;. On December 5, 2003, the couple filed for divorce, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot;. The character of John, a career-driven photographer (played by Giovanni Ribisi) in Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; (2003), was rumored to be based on Jonze, though Coppola commented &quot;It&#x27;s not Spike, but there are elements of him there, elements of experiences.&quot;

Jonze dated singer Karen O throughout 2005, although the couple broke up shortly after. &quot;People&quot; reported that Jonze dated actress Drew Barrymore in 2007. From 2008 to 2009, Jonze dated actress Michelle Williams, with whom he worked on &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot;. Jonze was reported to have begun dating Japanese actress Rinko Kikuchi in 2010 and the couple briefly lived together in New York City. They separated in 2011.

Since 2019, Jonze has been in a relationship with artist Allie Teilz, whom he met in 2013 on the set of &quot;Her&quot;. They have three sons: twins born in 2023 and another in 2024.

<doc id="26945" wikidata="Q34497" url="?curid=26945" title="Saint Helena">
<text>Saint Helena (, ) is one of the three constituent parts of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, a remote British overseas territory. 

Saint Helena is a volcanic and tropical island, located in the South Atlantic Ocean, some 1,874 km (1,165 miles) west of the mainland of the continent of Africa, with the Southern African nations of Angola and Namibia on its southwestern coast being the closest nations geographically. The island is around west of the coast of southwestern South Africa, and east of the major seaport city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in South America.

Saint Helena measures about and had a population of 4,439 in the 2021 census. It was named after Helena (AD c.246/248–330), influential mother of the famous Roman Emperor Constantine I (Constantine the Great). (A.D 272–337, reigned 306–337), of the ancient Roman Empire. It is one of the most remote major islands in the world and was uninhabited until the 16th century, when it was discovered by the Portuguese explorers/traders en route southward around the continent of Africa, then east across the Indian Ocean to the Indian subcontinent (India) of South Asia in 1502. For about the next four centuries, the island was an important stopover for ships between Europe and Asia sailing around the African continent and its southern Cape of Good Hope, before the opening of the shortcut Suez Canal in 1869, in Egypt between the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Saint Helena is the United Kingdom&#x27;s second-oldest overseas territory / possession of the old British Empire, after the islands of Bermuda, off the southeast coast of North America. Until the opening of its airport in 2017, the primary method of reaching Saint Helena was a 6-day journey by sea, most recently since 1989 on the RMS &quot;St Helena&quot; passenger steamship liner.

Saint Helena is known for being the site of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s second and longest period of exile, following his final defeat in June 1815, until his death there six years later.

== History ==
===Discovery===

According to long-established tradition, the island was sighted on 21 May 1502 by the four ships of the 3rd Portuguese Armada, commanded by João da Nova, a Galician navigator in the service of Portugal, during his return voyage to Lisbon, who named it Santa Helena after Saint Helena of Constantinople. This tradition was reviewed by a 2022 paper which concluded that the Portuguese chronicles published at least fifty years after the sighting are the sole primary source for the discovery. Although contradictory in describing other events, these chronicles almost unanimously claim that João da Nova found Saint Helena sometime in 1502, although none of them gives a precise date.

However, there are several reasons to doubt that da Nova made this discovery:

#Given that da Nova returned either on 11 September or on 13 September 1502 it is usually assumed that the Cantino planisphere, completed by the following November, includes his discovery of Ascension Island (shown as an archipelago, with one of six islands marked as &quot;ilha achada e chamada Ascenssam&quot;), yet this map fails to show Saint Helena.
#When a section of the Fourth Armada under the command of Estêvão da Gama sighted and landed at Saint Helena the following year on 30 July 1503, its scrivener Thomé Lopes regarded it as an unknown island, yet named Ascension as one of five reference points for the new island&#x27;s location. On 12 July 1503, nearly three weeks before reaching Saint Helena, Lopes described how Estêvão da Gama&#x27;s ships met up with a section of the Fifth Armada led by Afonso de Albuquerque off the Cape of Good Hope. The latter had left Lisbon about six months after João da Nova&#x27;s return, so Albuquerque and his captains should all have known whether João da Nova had indeed found St Helena. An anonymous Flemish traveler on one of da Gama&#x27;s ships reported that bread and victuals were running short by the time they reached the Cape, so from da Gama&#x27;s perspective there was a pressing need that he be told that water and meat could be found at Saint Helena. But nothing seems to have been said about the island, and Lopes regarded the island as unknown. This again implies that da Nova found Ascension but not St Helena.

The 2022 paper also reviews cartographic evidence that Saint Helena and Ascension were known to the Spanish in 1500, before either João da Nova or Estêvão da Gama sailed for India. The suggestion that da Nova discovered Tristan da Cunha and named it Saint Helena is discounted.

A 2015 paper notes that 21 May is the feast day of St Helena in the Eastern Orthodox and most Protestant churches, but the Roman Catholic one is in August, and the day and the month were first quoted in 1596 by Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, who was probably mistaken, because the island was discovered several decades before the Reformation and the start of Linschoten&#x27;s Protestant faith. An alternative discovery date of 3 May is suggested as being historically more credible; it is the Catholic feast day of the finding of the True Cross by Saint Helena in Jerusalem, and cited by Odoardo Duarte Lopes and Sir Thomas Herbert.

When Linschoten arrived at the island on 12 May 1589, he reported seeing carvings made by visiting seamen on a fig tree that were dated as early as 1510. The Portuguese probably planted saplings rather than mature trees, and for these to be sufficiently large by 1510 to carry carvings suggests the plants were shipped to the island and planted there some years earlier, possibly within a few years of discovery.

A third discovery story, told by 16th-century historian Gaspar Correia, holds that the island was found by Portuguese nobleman and warrior Dom Garcia de Noronha, who sighted the island on his way to India in late 1511 or early 1512. His pilots entered the island onto their charts, and this event likely led to the island being used as a regular stopover for rest and replenishment for ships en route from India to Europe, from that date until well into the 17th century. An analysis has been published of the Portuguese ships arriving at Saint Helena in the period 1502–1613.

===Exploitation of the island===
The Portuguese found the island uninhabited, with an abundance of trees and fresh water. They imported livestock, fruit trees, and vegetables, and built a chapel and one or two houses. The long tradition that João da Nova built a chapel from one of his wrecked carracks has been shown to be based on a misreading of the records. They formed no permanent settlement, but the island was an important rendezvous point and source of food for ships travelling by the Cape Route from Asia to Europe, and frequently sick mariners were left on the island to recover before taking passage on the next ship to call at the island.

Visits by British explorers followed and, once Saint Helena&#x27;s location was more widely known, British ships of war began to lie in wait in the area to attack Portuguese India carracks on their way home.

In developing their Far East trade, the Dutch also began to frequent the island. The Portuguese and Spanish soon gave up regularly calling at the island, partly because they used ports along the West African coast, but also because of attacks on their shipping, the desecration of their chapel and religious icons, killings of their livestock, and destruction of their plantations by Dutch pirates.

The Dutch Republic formally claimed Saint Helena in 1633, although no evidence indicates they ever occupied it. The Dutch lost interest in the island after establishing their colony at the Cape of Good Hope.

===East India Company (1658–1815)===

In 1657, Oliver Cromwell granted the East India Company (EIC) a charter to govern Saint Helena. The following year, the company decided to fortify the island and settle it with planters. A theory, which had its origins in the early 20th century, that the early settlers included many who had lost their homes in the 1666 Great Fire of London, was shown to be a myth in 1999.

The first governor, Captain John Dutton, arrived in 1659, making Saint Helena one of Britain&#x27;s earliest colonies outside Europe, North America and the Caribbean. A fort and houses were built: Jamestown had been founded, &quot;in the narrow valley between steep cliffs&quot;.

After the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1660, the EIC received a royal charter, giving it the sole right to fortify and colonise the island. The fort was renamed James Fort and the town was called Jamestown, in honour of the Duke of York, later King James II.

Between January and May 1673, the Dutch East India Company seized the island, but British reinforcements restored EIC control. The island was fortified with about 230 gun turrets.

The British government sent some settlers and gave them land that they could farm, but the company found it hard to attract enough settlers, despite advertisements in London and free tracts of land. By 1670, the population was only 66, including slaves. Also unrest and rebellion occurred among the inhabitants. Ecological problems, such as deforestation, soil erosion, vermin, and drought, led Governor Isaac Pyke to suggest in 1715 that the population be moved to Mauritius, but that was not acted upon. The company continued to subsidise the community because of the island&#x27;s strategic location. A census in 1723 recorded 1,110 inhabitants, including 610 slaves.
In the peak era, about 1,000 ships per year stopped there, leaving the governor to try to police the numerous visitors and to limit the consumption of arrack, a distilled alcoholic drink made from potatoes. There were two mutinies, perhaps fueled by alcohol. Because Jamestown was &quot;too raucous with its taverns and brothels&quot;, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral was built outside the town.

Eighteenth-century governors tried to tackle the island&#x27;s problems by planting trees, improving fortifications, eliminating corruption, building a hospital, tackling the neglect of crops and livestock, controlling the consumption of alcohol, and introducing legal reforms. The island enjoyed a lengthy period of prosperity from about 1770. Captain James Cook visited the island in 1775 on the final leg of his second circumnavigation of the world. St. James&#x27; Church was built in Jamestown in 1774, and Plantation House in 1791–92; the latter has since been the official residence of the governor.

Edmond Halley visited Saint Helena on leaving the University of Oxford in 1676, and set up an astronomical observatory with a aerial telescope, intending to study the stars of the Southern Hemisphere. The site of this telescope is near Saint Mathew&#x27;s Church at Hutt&#x27;s Gate in the Longwood district. The hill there is called Halley&#x27;s Mount.

Throughout that period, Saint Helena was an important port of call of the EIC. East Indiamen would stop there on the return leg of their voyages to British India and China. At Saint Helena, ships could replenish supplies of water and provisions and, during wartime, form convoys that would sail under the protection of vessels of the Royal Navy.

James Cook’s ship anchored and resupplied off the coast of Saint Helena in May 1771 on its return from the European discovery of the east coast of Australia and the rediscovery of New Zealand.

The British brought an estimated 25,000 slaves from west Africa to the island, in addition to the 3,000,000 they transported to the New World. The importation of slaves was made illegal in 1792, but the horrific conditions of slavery on St Helena were not abolished until 27 May 1839, when the &#x27;Ordinance For the Abolition of Slavery in the Island of St Helena&#x27; was enacted. Rupert&#x27;s Valley was the embarkation area for slaves; in 2008, when the road to the airport was being built, over 9,000 skeletal remains of slaves were uncovered in a mass burial area. They were reburied en masse in 2022 without ceremony of any kind. Governor Robert Patton (1802–1807) recommended that the company import workers from China to supplement the rural workforce. Many were allowed to stay, and their descendants became integrated into the population. In 1810, Chinese labourers began arriving, and by 1818, there were 650 in St Helena. An 1814 census recorded 3,507 people on the island. Many of the labourers were allowed to stay, though the need for their services had reduced by 1836.

===British rule (1815–1821) and Napoleon&#x27;s exile===


In 1815, the British government selected Saint Helena as the place of exile for Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821), former General of the French Army, First Consul of the First French Republic and later proclaimed Emperor of the French, after the pivotal Battle of Waterloo in June 1815, his subsequent second abdication (on 22 June 1815) and his final surrender, to Captain Frederick Maitland (1777–1839), of the British Royal Navy, on (15 July 1815). He was taken to the island in October 1815. Napoleon stayed at the Briars pavilion, on the grounds of the Balcombe family&#x27;s home, until his permanent residence at Longwood House was completed in December 1815. He died there five and half years later on 5 May 1821.

===British East India Company (1821–1834)===
Following Napoleon&#x27;s death, the soldiers and other temporary residents linked to his presence on the island were withdrawn and the EIC resumed full control of Saint Helena. Between 1815 and 1830, the EIC made available to the government of the island the packet schooner , which made multiple trips per year between the island and the Cape, carrying passengers both ways and supplies of wine and provisions back to the island. Napoleon praised Saint Helena&#x27;s coffee during his exile on the island, and the product enjoyed a brief popularity in Paris in the years after his death.

The importation of slaves to Saint Helena was banned in 1792. In 1818, the governor freed children born of slaves on the island. The phased emancipation of over 800 resident slaves took place in 1827, some six years before the British parliament passed legislation to abolish slavery in the colonies.

Between 1791 and 1833, Saint Helena became the site of a series of experiments in conservation, reforestation, and attempts to boost rainfall artificially. This environmental intervention was closely linked to the conceptualisation of the processes of environmental change and helped establish the roots of environmentalism.

===Crown colony (1834–1981)===

Under the provisions of the 1833 India Act, control of Saint Helena passed from the EIC to the British Crown, and it became a crown colony. Subsequent administrative cost-cutting triggered a long-term population decline; those who could afford to do so tended to leave the island for better opportunities elsewhere. The latter half of the 19th century saw the advent of steamships not reliant on trade winds, as well as the diversion of Far East trade away from the traditional South Atlantic shipping lanes to a route via the Red Sea (which, prior to the building of the Suez Canal, involved a short overland section).

In 1840, a British naval station established to suppress the Atlantic slave trade was based on the island, and between 1840 and 1849, over 15,000 freed slaves, known as &quot;Liberated Africans&quot;, were landed there.

In 1858, French emperor Napoleon III purchased, in the name of the French government, Longwood House and the lands around it, the last residence of Napoleon I (who died there in 1821; his remains had been returned to France in 1840.) It is still French property, administered by a French representative and under the authority of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

A 2020 report states that the island&#x27;s prosperity ended after 1869 when &quot;the Suez Canal shifted trade routes north&quot;. A 2019 report explained that &quot;ships no longer needed a stopping point on a longer journey to Europe&quot;. The number of ships calling at the island fell from 1,100 in 1855 to only 288 in 1889.

On 11 April 1898, American Joshua Slocum, on his solo round-the-world voyage, arrived at Jamestown. He departed on 20 April 1898 for the final leg of his circumnavigation, having been extended hospitality by the governor, R. A. Sterndale. He presented two lectures on his voyage and was invited to Longwood by the French consular agent.
By the end of 1899, St Helena was connected to London by undersea cable; this allowed for telegraph communication. In 1900 and 1901, over 6,000 Boer prisoners were held on the island, during the Second Anglo-Boer War. A 2019 report stated, &quot;no traces remain of the two POW camps&quot;, but added, &quot;the Boer Cemetery is a poignant spot&quot;. Among the notables were Piet Cronjé and his wife after their defeat at the Battle of Paardeberg. The resulting population reached an all-time high of 9,850 in 1901. By 1911, however, that had declined to 3,520 people. In 1906, the British government withdrew the garrison; the island&#x27;s economy suffered when spending by the soldiers stopped.

A local industry manufacturing fibre from New Zealand flax was successfully re-established in 1907 and generated considerable income during the First World War. Ascension Island was made a dependency of Saint Helena in 1922, and Tristan da Cunha followed in 1938. During the Second World War, the United States built Wideawake Airport on Ascension in 1942, but no military use was made of Saint Helena except maintenance of its defences.

Attendance at school became mandatory in 1942, for ages 5 to 15 in 1941, and the government took over control of the education system. The first secondary school opened in 1946. The American construction of Wideawake Airfield generated numerous jobs for St Helena; the sale of flax for rope also generated revenue for the island. However, the industry declined after 1951 because of transport costs and competition from synthetic fibres. The decision in 1965 by the British Post Office to use synthetic fibres for its mailbags was a further blow, contributing to the closure of the island&#x27;s flax mills in 1965.

From 1958, the Union-Castle shipping line gradually reduced its service calls to the island. Curnow Shipping, based in Avonmouth, replaced the Union-Castle Line mailship service in 1977, using the RMS &quot;St Helena&quot;, which was introduced in 1989.

===1981 to present===
The British Nationality Act 1981 reclassified Saint Helena and the other crown colonies as British Dependent Territories. For the next 20 years, many could find only low-paid work with the island government, and the only available employment outside Saint Helena was on the Falkland Islands and Ascension Island. The Development and Economic Planning Department (which still operates) was formed in 1988 to contribute to raising the living standards of the people of Saint Helena.

The Commission on Citizenship was established in 1992, restoring the islanders&#x27; rights including the right of abode. In 2002, the right to British citizenship was restored.

In 1989, Prince Andrew launched the replacement RMS &quot;St Helena&quot; to serve the island; the vessel was specially built for the Cardiff–Cape Town route and featured a mixed cargo/passenger layout.

The Saint Helena Constitution took effect in 1989, and provided that the island would be governed by a governor, a commander-in-chief, and an elected executive and legislative council. In 2002, the British Overseas Territories Act 2002 granted full British citizenship to the islanders and renamed the dependent territories (including Saint Helena) the British Overseas Territories. In 2009, The St Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha Constitution Order 2009 gave all three equal status; the British Overseas Territory was renamed Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha.

In 2021, a ministerial system was introduced in Saint Helena after UK&#x27;s approval of a constitutional amendment.

In January 2024, Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh visited the island. &quot;Prince Edward is the first royal trip to the island since Princess Anne, the Princess Royal visited in 2002. Other royal guests include King George VI, Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, Princess Margaret and The Queen Mother.&quot; While there, he visited Jonathan, a 191-year old tortoise, confirmed by the Guinness World Records to be the oldest living land animal. He toured the island, met residents, ceremonially opened the island&#x27;s airport, and gave an address in the island&#x27;s capital, Jamestown.

== Geography ==


Situated in the South Atlantic Ocean on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, more than from the nearest major landmass, Saint Helena is remote. The nearest port on the continent is Moçâmedes in southern Angola; connections to Cape Town, South Africa are used for most shipping needs via the regular cargo ship that serves the island, the MS &quot;Helena&quot;.

The island is on the same ridge as two other islands in the southern Atlantic, also British territories: Ascension Island, about due north-west in more equatorial waters, and Tristan da Cunha, which is outside the tropics to the south. The island, in the Western Hemisphere, has the same longitude as Land&#x27;s End (west Cornwall, England), and western Spain. For sharing several trading patterns, and climate effect traits, the island is grouped under West Africa/Africa in most projects, committees and papers of the United Nations.

The island is in area, and is composed largely of rugged terrain of volcanic origin (the last volcanic eruptions occurred about 7 million years ago). Coastal areas are scattered with vegetation on volcanic rock and are warmer and drier than the centre. The highest point of the island is Diana&#x27;s Peak at . In 1996 it became the island&#x27;s first national park. Much of the island is covered by New Zealand flax, a legacy of former industry, but there are some original trees augmented by plantations, including those of the Millennium Forest project, which was established in 2002 to replant, particularly with indigenous gumwood, part of the lost Great Wood and is now managed by the Saint Helena National Trust.

When the island was discovered, it was covered with unique indigenous vegetation, including a remarkable cabbage tree species. The island&#x27;s interior must have been a dense tropical forest but the coastal areas were probably also quite green. The modern landscape is very different, with widespread bare rock in the lower areas, although inland it is green, mainly due to introduced vegetation. There are no native land mammals, but cattle, cats, dogs, donkeys, goats, mice, rabbits, rats and sheep have been introduced. The dramatic change in landscape must be attributed to these introductions. As a result, the string tree (&quot;Acalypha rubrinervis&quot;) and the Saint Helena olive (&quot;Nesiota elliptica&quot;) are now extinct, and many of the other endemic plants are threatened with extinction.

Some 22 named rocks and islets are offshore: Castle Rock, Speery Island, the Needle, Lower Black Rock, Upper Black Rock (South), Bird Island (Southwest), Black Rock, Thompson&#x27;s Valley Island, Peaked Island, Egg Island, Lady&#x27;s Chair, Lighter Rock (West), Long Ledge (Northwest), Shore Island, George Island, Rough Rock Island, Flat Rock (East), the Buoys, Sandy Bay Island, the Chimney, White Bird Island and Frightus Rock (Southeast) – all within of the shore.

The national bird of Saint Helena is the Saint Helena plover, known locally as the wirebird, on account of its wire-like legs. It appears on the coat of arms of Saint Helena and on the flag.

=== Climate ===

The climate of Saint Helena is tropical, marine and mild, tempered by the Benguela Current and trade winds that blow almost continuously. The climate varies noticeably across the island. Temperatures in Jamestown, on the north leeward shore, are in the range in the summer (January to April) and during the remainder of the year. The temperatures in the central areas are, on average, lower. Jamestown also has a very low annual rainfall, while falls per year on the higher ground and the south coast, where it is also noticeably cloudier. There are weather recording stations in the Longwood and Blue Hill districts.

== Administrative divisions ==

Saint Helena is divided into eight districts, with the majority housing a community centre. The districts also serve as statistical divisions. The island is a single electoral area and elects 12 representatives to the Legislative Council of 15.
The difference between the total population of the Administrative Districts and that recorded in the 2016 Census arises because the census included 183 people on board the RMS St. Helena and 13 people who were on yachts in the harbour.

== Population ==
=== Demographics ===

Saint Helena was first settled by the English in 1659. , the island had a population of 4,897 inhabitants, mainly descended from people from Britain, settlers (&quot;planters&quot;) and soldiers, and slaves who were brought there from the beginning of settlement, initially from Africa (the Cape Verde Islands, Gold Coast and west coast of Africa are mentioned in early records), then India and Madagascar. The importation of slaves was made illegal in 1792.

In 1840, Saint Helena became a provisioning station for the British West Africa Squadron, preventing the transportation of slaves to Brazil (mainly), and many thousands of slaves were freed on the island. These were all African, and about 500 stayed while the rest were sent on to the West Indies and Cape Town, and eventually to Sierra Leone.

Imported Chinese labourers arrived in 1810, reaching a peak of 618 in 1818, after which numbers were reduced. Only a few older men remained after the British Crown took over the government of the island from the East India Company in 1834. The majority were sent back to China, although records in the Cape suggest that they never got any farther than Cape Town. There were also a few Indian lascars who worked under the harbour master.

The citizens of Saint Helena hold British Overseas Territories citizenship. On 21 May 2002, full British citizenship was restored by the British Overseas Territories Act 2002. See also British nationality law.

During periods of unemployment, there has been a long pattern of emigration from the island since the post-Napoleonic period. The majority of &quot;Saints&quot; emigrated to the United Kingdom, South Africa and in the early years, Australia. The population had been steadily declining since the late 1980s and dropped from 5,157 at the 1998 census to 4,257 in 2008. However, as of the 2021 census, the population has risen to 4,439 a drop of 95 people from 2016. In the past emigration was characterised by young unaccompanied persons leaving to work on long-term contracts on Ascension and the Falkland Islands, but since &quot;Saints&quot; were re-awarded British citizenship in 2002, emigration to Britain by a wider range of wage-earners has accelerated due to the prospect of higher wages and better progression prospects. By 2018 Swindon, Wiltshire, had a concentration of people originating from Saint Helena, and therefore it got the nickname &quot;Swindolena&quot;.

=== Religion ===

Most residents are Anglican and are members of the Diocese of St Helena, which has its own bishop and includes Ascension Island. The 150th anniversary of the diocese was celebrated in June 2009.

Other Christian denominations on the island include the Roman Catholic (since 1852), the Salvation Army (since 1884), Baptist (since 1845) and, in more recent times, the Seventh-day Adventist (since 1949), the New Apostolic Church, and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (of which one in 35 residents is a member, the highest ratio of any country).

The Roman Catholics are pastorally served by the Mission sui iuris of Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, whose office of ecclesiastical superior is vested in the Apostolic Prefecture of the Falkland Islands.

== Government ==

Executive authority in Saint Helena is vested in King Charles III and is exercised on his behalf by the Governor of Saint Helena. The Governor is appointed by the King on the advice of the British government. Defence and foreign affairs remain the responsibility of the United Kingdom.

The Executive Council is presided over by the Governor and consists of three &quot;ex officio&quot; officers and five elected members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Governor. There is no elected Chief Minister, and the Governor acts as the head of government. In January 2013 it was proposed that the Executive Council would be led by a Chief Councillor who would be elected by the members of the Legislative Council and would nominate the other members of the Executive Council. These proposals were put to a referendum on 23 March 2013, when they were defeated by 158 votes to 42 on a 10% turnout. Another referendum in 2021, however, saw the population approve the changes.

The legislature of Saint Helena consists of the unicameral Legislative Council of Saint Helena and the King-in-Parliament (represented by the Governor). The Legislative Council consists of 15 members, of whom 12 are directly elected members who each serve a four-year term; a Speaker and Deputy Speaker who are chosen by the elected members; and one &quot;ex officio&quot; member, the Attorney General. Members of the Council use the post-nominal letters &quot;MLC&quot; (Member of the Legislative Council)

The island is policed by the Royal Saint Helena Police Service (RSHPS). The RSHPS is also the primary law enforcement agency for Ascension Island and the archipelago of Tristan da Cunha. Like many other Commonwealth nations, the warranted personnel of the RSHPS are known as &#x27;constables&#x27;, and the service also uses special constables, in addition to employing non-warranted staff personnel. The RSHPS also uses a variety of ranks similar to other Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. Saint Helena has one police station, &quot;Coleman House&quot;, named after PC Leonard John Coleman who died in the line of duty on 2 December 1982. The Island&#x27;s only prison—HMP Jamestown—was built in 1827 and in 2018.

One commentator has observed that notwithstanding the high unemployment resulting from the loss of full passports during 1981–2002, the Saint Helena population&#x27;s loyalty to the British monarchy is probably not exceeded in any other part of the world. King George VI is the only reigning monarch to have visited the island. This was in 1947 when the King, accompanied by Queen Elizabeth (later The Queen Mother), Princess Elizabeth (later Queen Elizabeth II) and Princess Margaret were travelling to South Africa. The Duke of Edinburgh arrived at Saint Helena in 1957, followed by his son, Prince Andrew, who visited as a member of the armed forces in 1984, and his daughter, the Princess Royal, in 2002. Prince Edward, Duke of Edinburgh made an official visit to Saint Helena in late January 2024, where he was greeted by Jonathan the Tortoise, a 191 years-old Seychelles Giant Tortoise born during the reign of King William IV.

== Human rights ==
In 2012, the government of Saint Helena funded the creation of the Saint Helena Human Rights Action Plan 2012–2015. Work is being done under this action plan, including publishing awareness-raising articles in local newspapers, providing support for members of the public with human rights queries, and extending several UN Conventions on human rights to St. Helena.

Legislation to set up an Equality and Human Rights Commission was passed by Legislative Council in July 2015. This commenced operation in October 2015.

===Child safeguarding inquiry 2015===
In 2014, there were reports of child abuse in Saint Helena. Britain&#x27;s Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) was accused of lying to the United Nations about child abuse in Saint Helena to cover up allegations.

Sasha Wass QC and her team arrived on Saint Helena on 17 March 2015 to commence the Inquiry and departed on 1 April 2015. Announcements were made in local newspapers in the week ending 13 March 2015.

A government report was published on 10 December 2015. It found that the accusations were grossly exaggerated, and the lurid headlines in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; had come from information from two social workers, whom the report described as incompetent.

===Same-sex marriage===
In 2017, a male St Helenian made an application to the Registrar to marry his male fiancé on St Helena. The laws at the time had referred to marriages between men and women and it was not clear whether same-sex marriages were lawful. After consultation events, endorsement by the Social and Community Development Committee and Executive Council, the Marriage Ordinance was updated and agreed by Legislative Council in December 2017. Registrar Karen Yon oversaw the first same-sex wedding between the original 2017 applicants, Saint Helenian Lemarc Thomas and Swedish national Michael Wernstedt, in a ceremony at Plantation House on 31 December 2018.

===Reburial of excavated human remains===
In 2021, a wreath was placed by the Saint Helena&#x27;s Equality &amp; Human Rights Commission (EHRC) on the door of the Pipe Store in Jamestown. The Pipe Store is a building where the remains of some 325 people, men, women, and children disinterred during airport construction were being stored pending reburial since 2008. The remains belonged to liberated Africans who had been rescued by the Royal Navy&#x27;s West Africa Squadron during the suppression of the Atlantic slave trade and brought to Saint Helena.

== Biodiversity ==

Saint Helena has long been known for its high proportion of endemic birds and vascular plants. The highland areas contain most of the 400 endemic species recognised to date. Much of the island has been identified by BirdLife International as being important for bird conservation, especially the endemic Saint Helena plover or wirebird, and for seabirds breeding on the offshore islets and stacks, in the north-east and the south-west Important Bird Areas. 

On the basis of these endemics and an exceptional range of habitats, Saint Helena is on the United Kingdom&#x27;s tentative list for future UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Artist Rolf Weijburg produced original etchings of Saint Helena, picturing various species of these endemic birds.

Saint Helena&#x27;s biodiversity, however, also includes marine vertebrates, invertebrates (freshwater, terrestrial and marine), fungi (including lichen-forming species), non-vascular plants, seaweeds and other biological groups. To date, very little is known about these, although more than 200 lichen-forming fungi have been recorded, including nine endemics, suggesting that many significant discoveries remain to be made.

Various flora and fauna on the island have become extinct. Due to deforestation, the last wild endemic St Helena olive tree, &quot;Nesiota elliptica&quot;, died in 1994, and by December 2003, the last cultivated olive tree died. The native St. Helena earwig was last seen in the wild in 1967.

A large reforestation project has been under way since 2000 in the north-eastern corner of the island, known as the Millennium Forest, to recreate the Great Wood that existed before colonisation.

The island&#x27;s shoreline is deep and is known to have abundant red crab. In 1991, a crab-fishing vessel, &quot;Oman Sea One&quot;, which was engaged in potting of crabs, capsized and later sank off the coast of Saint Helena on its way from Ascension Island, losing four crew members. One crew member was rescued by .

Since 2022, advances in the understanding of Saint Helena&#x27;s spiders have been gained. Some studies published in 2023 and 2024 described new genera and species. Perhaps most notable was the mole spider (&quot;Molearachne&quot; &quot;sanctaehelenae&quot; Sherwood, Henrard, Logunov &amp; Fowler, 2024), the first known wolf spider from outside of a cave environment known to have reduced anterior median eyes, and which builds unique &#x27;mole hills&#x27; unlike any other spider. Other species described include the Mount Vesey wolf spider (&quot;Hogna veseyensis&quot;), which has a range currently restricted to a single waterfall and three which were named after local Saint Helenian scientists: the Liza pirate spider (&quot;Ero lizae&quot;), the Natasha pirate spider (&quot;Ero natashae&quot;) and the Daryl wolf spider (&quot;Dolocosa joshuai&quot;).

:&quot;Note: Some of the data in this section have been sourced from the &quot;Government of St Helena Sustainable Development Plan
The island had a monocrop economy until 1966, based on the cultivation and processing of New Zealand flax for rope and string.

A 2019 report states that &quot;by the 1970s, a majority of Saints were working abroad and sending money home&quot;.

Saint Helena&#x27;s economy is now developing, but is almost entirely sustained by aid from the British government. The public sector dominates the economy, accounting for about 50% of gross domestic product. However, the start of regular air services has led to a rise in tourism, and the Government is encouraging investment on the island, as shown by their Investment Policy and Strategy and the investment prospectus for potential investors. In 2019, Saint Helena achieved its first-ever &quot;Investment Grade&quot; credit rating, a credit rating of BBB− (stable), from global credit rating agency Standard &amp; Poors (S&amp;P).

In 2019, the estimated average annual salary was only about 8,000 Saint Helena pounds (about US$10,000).

Saint Helena&#x27;s Sustainable Economic Development Plan, 2018–28, was developed using more than six months of local and international consultation in 2017–2018. The document represented a 10-year plan to kick-start the economy after Saint Helena established air access and fibre connectivity and moved away from relying purely on tourism for growth, announcing a desire to &quot;increase exports, and decrease imports&quot;. The SEDP stated that the island&#x27;s comparative advantages are its natural resources and geography, its status as a British Overseas Territory, its currency, relatively inexpensive labour and property costs, and low crime. Targeted export growth sectors include tourism, fisheries, coffee, satellite ground stations, remote workers and digital nomads, academia, research and conferences, liquor, wines and beers, ship registry and sailing qualifications, traditional products, honey and honey bees, and its use as a film location. Growth sectors for import substitution include agriculture, timber, bricks, blocks, minerals and rocks, and bottled water.

The tourist industry is heavily based on the promotion of Napoleon&#x27;s imprisonment as well as nature activities such as scuba diving, swimming with whale sharks, whale watching, bird watching, marine tours, and hiking. There is also a golf course, and sportfishing is possible. Several hotels, B&amp;Bs, and self-catering apartments operate on the island. The arrival of tourists is linked to the Saint Helena Airport (and in the past, the arrival and departure schedule of the now-retired RMS &quot;St Helena&quot;).

Saint Helena produces the most expensive coffee in the world. It also produces and exports Tungi Spirit, made from the fruit of the prickly or cactus pears, &quot;Opuntia ficus-indica&quot; (&quot;Tungi&quot; is the local Saint Helenian name for the plant), and coffee liqueur, gin, and rum in its local distillery. Due to the absence of parasites and disease in bees, beekeepers collect some of the purest honey in the world.

Saint Helena has a small fishing industry, landing mostly tuna. The fishery is committed to one-by-one fishing and uses the motto &quot;one pole, one line, one fish at a time&quot;. Some of Saint Helena&#x27;s exported tuna has been served in restaurants in Cape Town.

Like Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha, Saint Helena is permitted to issue its own postage stamps, an enterprise that provides an income. Saint Helena also issues domain names under the top-level domain .sh.

===Economic statistics===
Between 2009 and 2017, Saint Helena&#x27;s HDI increased from 0.714 to 0.756; this placed Saint Helena in the &#x27;high&#x27; category of human development, according to the classification used by the United Nations. Compared to other countries around the globe, Saint Helena&#x27;s HDI ranking rose from 93rd (out of 190 countries ranked) to 83rd in the world.

The average (median) annual wage on Saint Helena in 2018–19 was an estimated £8,410. The median male wage was higher than the median female wage. The gap between the two grew in 2013–14, but narrowed in 2017–18, as male wages fell on average, and the median female wage level grew. This is probably due to the completion of the construction of the airport, since workers employed on the project were predominantly male, and many of them either left Saint Helena or found alternative employment between 2016 and 2018. Nonetheless, both female and male median wage levels fell sharply in 2018–19.

The overall retail price index is measured quarterly on Saint Helena by the SHG Statistics Office. The RPI was measured at 105.9 in the first quarter of 2020. This was unchanged from the index for the fourth quarter of 2019, and an increase from 104.1 in the first quarter of 2019. This means that retail prices rose, on average, by 1.7% over the year between the first quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020. As most of the goods available in retail outlets on Saint Helena are imported from either South Africa or the United Kingdom, Saint Helena&#x27;s prices are heavily influenced by price inflation in those two countries, the value of the Saint Helena pound compared to the South African rand, the cost of freight, and import taxes. In the UK, the annual price inflation rate (using the consumer price index) was 1.7% for February 2020, down from 1.8% in January 2020. In South Africa, the consumer price index was 4.6% for February, up from 4.5% in January 2020. In addition, since early 2019 the value of the South African Rand has steadily weakened, from around 17 Rand per pound to around 20 at the end of March 2020; this has a counter-effect to the South African inflation, and in some cases may even have made South African goods cheaper to buy. This will mitigate against some pressures which might cause prices to rise, such as increasing freight prices on the MV Helena.

Between January 2010 and March 2016, just before the first 40 people arrived by air in April 2016, the average number of arrivals per month by sea (excluding day visitors arriving on cruise ships) was 307, with an average of 245 arriving on the Royal Mail Ship (RMS) Saint Helena. Between October 2017 (when the first scheduled air service began) and September 2019, an average of 432 passengers arrived per month, with 314 of those passengers arriving by air. Since October 2017, a total of 3,337 people have arrived by air in the first 12-month period, and 4,188 in the second. The increase in the second year followed the introduction of a mid-week flight during the peak period of December 2018 to April 2019. Arrivals by air were higher in the second year, in every month apart from May and June.

===Banking and currency===

In 1821, Saul Solomon (the uncle of Saul Solomon) issued 70,560 copper tokens worth a halfpenny each &quot;Payable at St Helena by Solomon, Dickson and Taylor&quot;—presumably London partners—that circulated alongside the East India Company&#x27;s local coinage until the Crown took over the island in 1836. The coin remains readily available to collectors.

Saint Helena has had its own currency since 1976, the Saint Helena pound, which is at parity with the pound sterling and is also the currency of Ascension Island. The government of Saint Helena produces its own coinage, banknotes since 1976 and circulating coins since 1984. Whereas circulating coins are struck with &quot;Saint Helena • Ascension&quot;, the banknotes only say &quot;Government of St. Helena&quot;. There are also commemorative coins struck for Saint Helena only.

The Bank of Saint Helena was established on Saint Helena and Ascension Island in 2004. It has branches in Jamestown on Saint Helena, and Georgetown, Ascension Island. The bank took over the business of the Saint Helena government savings bank and Ascension Island Savings Bank.

For more information on currency in the wider region, see British currency in the South Atlantic and the Antarctic.

===Tourism===

Before the airport opened, the primary tourist groups were dedicated hikers and retirees, as the required voyage on the RMS &quot;St Helena&quot; took five days each way. That was unattractive to most tourists with regular jobs. The hikers seemed willing to use the extra days of leave to get to and from Saint Helena, and retirees would not be concerned with voyage times.

The decision to build the airport, in order to significantly boost tourism, was taken in 2011 by the governments of Saint Helena and the UK. Construction was completed by 2016. One reason for the delay was that the British decided to fill in a valley &quot;with some 800 million pounds of dirt and rock&quot; to create flat land for the runway. 

The first flight did not arrive until October 2017, because of &quot;dangerous wind conditions&quot; that made landing large aircraft unsafe. The solution was to use smaller aircraft for the five- or six-hour flight from South Africa. The wind still causes problems: &quot;only a special, stripped-down Embraer 190 jet with the best pilots in the world can stick the landing&quot;. The government&#x27;s long-term goal is to get 30,000 visitors per year. Because of the few flights and limited capacity of the aircraft, only 894 visitors arrived in the year the airport finally opened.

Passenger service on the Royal Mail ship was then discontinued. The Airlink flights, operating twice a week, increased the island&#x27;s potential to attract a broader range of tourists.

St Helena Tourism updated its tourism marketing strategy in 2018. This outlined the targeted markets and Saint Helena&#x27;s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. It also outlined the unique selling points of the island, including nature (whale sharks and wirebirds), Saint culture (safer environment), walking and hiking, diving, arts and crafts, twin destination with South Africa, photography, running, history and heritage (Napoleon), stargazing, and food and drink.

The island&#x27;s first luxury hotel, the Mantis in Jamestown, opened in 2017 in the converted &quot;former officers barracks built in 1774&quot; according to &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot;. Most other types of accommodations were also available on the island.

A 2019 report by &quot;The Guardian&quot; recommended that tourists visit &quot;Longwood House, where Napoleon was exiled after Waterloo ... Plantation House, the residence of the governor&quot; and to try one of the whale shark snorkelling expeditions. The report spoke highly of Jamestown, with its &quot;pastel-toned houses, sweltering palm trees and colonial relics—stark reminders of imperialist ideals&quot;. Another 2019 report indicated that smartphones had become common, &quot;with the &#x27;Saint Memes&#x27; Facebook page and other social media exporting their sharp sense of humour&quot;. But, as the report concludes, the island &quot;remains a place with an anchor in the past, where ... there are single-digit car licence plates and motorists on the hairpin roads unfailingly wave at each other&quot;.

Before the lockdowns and restriction necessitated by the COVID-19 global pandemic, Saint Helena was on track to meet its tourism targets of 12% growth a year, in order to achieve over 29,000 leisure visitors by the 25th anniversary of the air service.

As of April 2020, research indicated that arrivals in Saint Helena were primarily non-Saint tourists (without a connection to the island), followed by returning Saints (who were visiting friends and relatives), followed by returning residents and then business arrivals. Non-Saint tourists tend to stay for a week, whilst Saints visiting friends and relatives tend to stay for about a month. Around 37% of tourists are British, 21% South African, 13% European other than British, German or French and 9% American or from the Caribbean. Most non-Saint tourists are over 40 years of age, with around 40% being 40 to 59 and around 40% being 60-plus. In 2018 tourism contributed approximately £4–5 million to the economy, and in 2019 this increased to around £5–6 million.

====Effects of the pandemic====
One news report in August 2020 stated that the costs imposed by the pandemic led to the &quot;collapse of the island&#x27;s tourism sector, which was meant to drive its economic development&quot;.

In 2021, the bicentennial anniversary of Napoleon&#x27;s death was expected to boost tourism if the pandemic did not prevent visits for many months. As of September 2020, the government was preparing a &quot;tourism recovery strategy&quot;, to include an international publicity campaign and the development of further tourism infrastructure for the island&quot;.

As of 30 October 2020, the Government website stated that &quot;due to the COVID-19 pandemic, travel to Saint Helena will only be permitted for limited purposes at this time&quot;. An item posted on 4 March 2021 on the UK Government website stated that &quot;all arrivals to St Helena are required to have had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours before travelling&quot; and with a few exceptions, non-Saints were not allowed to visit. In addition, all arrivals were required to self-quarantine for 14 days after landing in Saint Helena.

As of 8 August 2022, the Government website stated that &quot;St Helena lifted its COVID-19 entry regulations. This means no quarantine, no testing and no mask-wearing requirements&quot;.

=== Energy ===
Connect Saint Helena Ltd. operates electricity generation and distribution. As of 2023, 80% of electricity generated in St Helena comes from 6 diesel generators. 12 wind turbines are installed on the Deadwood Plain in Longwood and were originally installed in the 1990s, expanded in 2009 and 2014. A 500kW solar farm is in operation as well as photovoltaic arrays on 4 public buildings. As a result of the fact that almost all energy must be imported (diesel/oil), electricity is expensive in St Helena, at £0.53/kWh as of 2024. 42% of the utility&#x27;s costs are due to oil purchases.

A plan to expand the use of renewable solar and wind power was announced in 2016, but never came to fruition. Electricity production from wind has declined steadily from 2014-2024, due to unreliable equipment and grid balancing challenges. In 2024, a new target of 80% renewable electricity production by 2027 was announced, by renewing and expanding wind and solar facilities as well as considering the potential of battery storage.

== Transport ==
Saint Helena is one of the most remote islands in the world. It has one commercial airport, Saint Helena Airport; access to the island has improved greatly since its opening in 2017. Sea freight is serviced through Saint Helena&#x27;s single wharf in Ruperts. The island has a mostly paved road network extending to all inhabited areas of the island, although it is mostly single lane.

===Sea===

The Saint Helena Government contracts international shipping companies to provide maritime freight services to the island. As of March 2024, MACS Maritime Carrier Shipping GmbH &amp; Co provides regular freight services to the island, usually on a monthly basis. It sails from Cape Town to Saint Helena and Ascension Island.

Commercial shipping to Saint Helena is handled at the island&#x27;s sole wharf at Ruperts Bay, originally built to assist the airport construction.

Until 2017, the Royal Mail Ship ran between Saint Helena and Cape Town on a five-day voyage, then the only scheduled connection to the island. She berthed offshore in James Bay, Saint Helena about 30 times per year, and passengers and freight were transferred ashore by small boats.

Saint Helena receives around 600 yachting visitors a year.

===Air===

Saint Helena Airport (IATA: HLE) was opened for commercial traffic on 14 October 2017, the island&#x27;s first and only airport. The South African airline Airlink operates weekly flights to Johannesburg, as well as charter flights to Ascension Island and seasonal flights to Cape Town. The airport also operates medivac flights and accommodates general aviation. Scheduled flights to and from Johannesburg operated by an Embraer E190 usually include a fuel stop (on the Saint Helena-bound leg only) at Walvis Bay, with a flight time of around 4.5 to 6 hours. Air freight (including mail) is carried by scheduled air services.

The prospect of an airport on St Helena was debated for a long time. Eventually, in March 2005 the British government announced plans to construct the Saint Helena Airport. This aimed to help the island become more self-sufficient, encouraging economic development through tourism while reducing dependence on British government aid. In 2011, South African civil engineering company Basil Read was contracted to construct the airport, originally projected to open in 2016. The first aircraft landed at the new airport on 15 September 2015. The airport&#x27;s opening date was delayed due to uncertainty about the impact of high winds and wind shear. In 2017, South African airline Airlink became the preferred bidder to provide a weekly air service between the island and Johannesburg. 

Due to the location of the airport site, at times serious wind shear makes it difficult to land from the north. It is safe to land from the other direction, but it is plagued by tailwinds, which increase landing ground speed and can limit aircraft loading.

===Road===
Traffic in Saint Helena drives on the left and road signs are based on British standards. There is an island-wide speed limit of 30 mph (48 km/hr); lower in some areas. There are many private vehicles on the island despite the steep and narrow roads, hairpin bends and limited parking in Jamestown. Roads into Jamestown include Side Path and Field Road, which have been upgraded and improved in the period 2022–24. There are three roundabouts on the island. The road constructed for conveying materials from Ruperts Bay to the airport during construction was paved and opened for public traffic in 2019, a major addition to the island&#x27;s road network.

A minibus offers a basic bus service to carry people around Saint Helena, with most services designed to take people into Jamestown. Taxis, as well as car hire services, are available.

==Media and communications==

Telecommunications services in St Helena are provided by Sure South Atlantic, providing landline, mobile (2G/4G), internet and television services. International connectivity is provided by the Google Equiano submarine cable. There are three FM radio stations broadcasting in St Helena as of 2023 and two weekly newspapers are published. 

All of St Helena&#x27;s international connectivity was by satellite until the activation of the Equiano submarine cable in October 2023. 

Telecom services in St Helena are comparatively expensive, for example, all TV channels are encrypted and a subscription costs amount to more than one tenth of an average worker&#x27;s salary.

Sure South Atlantic holds a licensed monopoly on telecommunications on the island until 31 December 2025. As of 2023, new telecoms regulations were being drafted; there was a &quot;possibility of issuing a license to a different provider after Sure&#x27;s term expires&quot;.

===Telecommunications===
Saint Helena has the international calling code +290, which Tristan da Cunha has shared since 2006. Landline telephones are available to all households on the island. Until 2023, a satellite ground station with a 7.6-metre satellite dish installed in 1989 was the only international connectivity to the island. Bandwidth was extremely limited and data caps were low. 

The Equiano submarine cable was activated in 2023, substantially improving communications on the island, offering hugely increased bandwidth and unlimited data plans for the first time.

Mobile phone service (2G/4G) commenced in September 2015.&quot;&quot; As of 2024, ADSL2 service is available to most households, with speeds ranging from 2 to 20 Mbit/s. It is envisioned that a fibre optic network will be installed to homes and businesses by Maestro Technologies, but plans have stalled as of 2024.

=== Television and Radio ===
Television services first arrived in 1995. The current digital broadcasting network uses DVB-T2 standards and retransmits international content from satellites. A local television channel was in operation from 2015 to 2017 by SAMS (South Atlantic Media Services, Ltd.), consisting of a weekly news bulletin. 

Radio broadcasting began in 1967 with Radio Saint Helena (now defunct). Today, South Atlantic Media Services (SAMS), supported by the St Helena Government, broadcasts two FM stations: SAMS Radio 1, providing locally produced news, talk and music programming; SAMS also rebroadcasts the BBC World Service. Saint FM Community Radio is the island&#x27;s only independent broadcaster.

Occasional amateur radio operations also occur on the island. The ITU prefix used is ZD7.

=== Local newspapers ===
The island has two local newspapers, both of which are available online. The &quot;St Helena Independent&quot; has been published since November 2005. &quot;The Sentinel&quot; newspaper was introduced in 2012. &quot;Saint Helena Island Info&quot; is an online resource featuring the history of St. Helena from its discovery to the present day, plus photographs and information about life on St. Helena today.

===Satellite ground stations===
In February 2018, the government of St Helena launched a project to attract low earth orbit satellite operators to install ground stations on the island. Leasing backhaul capacity could contribute to operational costs on the submarine cable. OneWeb announced the construction of a satellite ground station on St. Helena in 2023.

== Culture and society ==
===Education===

The Education and Employment Directorate, formerly the Saint Helena Education Department, in 2000 had its head office in The Canister in Jamestown. Education is free and compulsory between the ages of five and 16. At the beginning of the academic year 2009–10, 230 students were enrolled in primary school and 286 in secondary school. The island has three primary schools for students of age four to 11: Harford, Pilling, and St Paul&#x27;s.
* St Paul&#x27;s Primary School in St Paul&#x27;s, formerly St Paul&#x27;s Middle School, has both first and middle levels as it was formed by a 1 August 2000 merger. it has 134 students and serves, in addition to St Paul&#x27;s, Bluehill, Gordons Post, New Ground, Sandy Bay, and Upper Half Tree Hollow. In 2002, in addition to St Paul&#x27;s it served a portion of Half Tree Hollow as well as the communities of Blue Hill, Guinea Grass, Hunt&#x27;s Bank, New Ground, Sandy Bay, Thompson&#x27;s Hill, and Vaughn&#x27;s.
* Harford Primary School in Longwood, with Governor James Harford as its namesake, opened as a senior school in 1957 and became Hardford Middle School in September 1988. It merged with Longwood First School in 2008. It also serves Alarm Forest and Levelwood.
* Pilling Primary School is in Jamestown. Occupying a former garrison, the school was established in 1941 and became Pilling Middle School in 1988. Jamestown First School, located next door to Pilling Middle, merged into it in May 2005 as a result of declining enrolment. The merged school initially used both buildings, but as the enrolment continued its decline, the ex-Jamestown First Building, constructed in 1959, was no longer in use after 2007. In addition to Jamestown it serves Alarm Forest, Briars, Lower Half Tree Hollow, Rupert&#x27;s, and Sea View. it had 126 students.
Prince Andrew School provides secondary education for students aged 11 to 18.

It formerly had separate first schools catering to younger students (ages 3 to 7 as of 2002):
* Half Tree Hollow First School, originally a primary school, opened as such in 1949 with its current name and year configuration in place since 1988. In addition to Half Tree Hollow it served Cleugh&#x27;s Plain, New Ground, and Sapper Way.
* Jamestown First School, originally Jamestown Junior School, opened as such in 1959 with its current name and year configuration in place since 1988.
* Longwood First School, originally a primary school, opened in 1949 in a former mess hall for military officers that had been constructed in 1942; this building had an expansion in 1977, and there are four classrooms in a separate building that was built in 1958. Longwood became a &quot;first school&quot; in 1988.

The Education and Employment Directorate also offers programmes for students with special needs, vocational training, adult education, evening classes, and distance learning. The island has a public library (the oldest in the Southern Hemisphere, open since 1813) and a mobile library service which operates weekly in rural areas.

The English national curriculum is adapted for local use. A range of qualifications are offered—from GCSE, A/S and A2, to Level 3 Diplomas and Vocationally Recognised Qualifications (VRQs):

:GCSEs
:* Design and Technology
:* ICT
:* Business Studies

Saint Helena has no tertiary education. Scholarships are offered for students to study abroad. St Helena Community College (SHCC) has some vocational and professional education programmes available.

===Sport===

Historically, the St Helena Turf Club organised the island&#x27;s first recorded sports events in 1818 with a series of horse races at Deadwood. Saint Helena has sent teams to a number of Commonwealth Games. Saint Helena is a member of the International Island Games Association. The Saint Helena cricket team made its debut in international cricket in Division Three of the African region of the World Cricket League in 2012. The Saint Helena football team first tournament was the 2019 Inter Games Football Tournament after which it was ranked tenth out of ten.

The Governor&#x27;s Cup is a yacht race between Cape Town and Saint Helena island, held every two years in December and January.

In Jamestown a timed run takes place up Jacob&#x27;s Ladder every year, with people coming from all over the world to take part.

===Scouting and Girl Guiding===
There are Scouting and Guiding Groups on Saint Helena and Ascension Island. Scouting was established on Saint Helena island in 1912. Lord and Lady Baden-Powell visited the Scouts on Saint Helena on the return from their 1937 tour of Africa. The visit is described in Lord Baden-Powell&#x27;s book, titled &quot;African Adventures&quot;.

===Cuisine===
In 2017, Julia Buckley of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote that, due to the lack of nouvelle cuisine, the food is &quot;[p]retty retro, at least by London standards.&quot; Fish cakes in a St Helena style, with egg binding and chili, and a risotto-with-curry dish called &quot;pilau&quot; (or &quot;plo&quot;, similar to the Indian rice dish &quot;pulao&quot;) are what Buckley describes as &quot;staple[s]&quot;. Indeed, most of the local recipes are variations of world dishes brought to the island by travellers.

===Language===
English is the official language. The local basilect is called Saint-speak, Saint, or Saint English, which is a form of South Atlantic English.

<text>Spinning is a twisting technique to form yarn from fibers. The fiber intended is drawn out, twisted, and wound onto a bobbin. A few popular fibers that are spun into yarn other than cotton, which is the most popular, are viscose (the most common form of rayon), animal fibers such as wool, and synthetic polyester. Originally done by hand using a spindle whorl, starting in the 500s AD the spinning wheel became the predominant spinning tool across Asia and Europe. The spinning jenny and spinning mule, invented in the late 1700s, made mechanical spinning far more efficient than spinning by hand, and especially made cotton manufacturing one of the most important industries of the Industrial Revolution.

==Process==

The yarn issuing from the drafting rollers passes through a thread-guide, round a traveller that is free to rotate around a ring, and then onto a tube or bobbin, which is carried on to a spindle, the axis of which passes through a center of the ring.
The spindle is driven (usually at an angular velocity that is either constant or changes only slowly), and the traveller is dragged around a ring by the loop of yarn passing round it.
If the drafting rollers were stationary, the angular velocity of the traveller would be the same as that of the spindle, and each revolution of the spindle would cause one turn of a twist to be inserted in the loop of yarn between the roller nip and the traveller. 
In spinning, however, the yarn is continually issuing from the rollers of the drafting system and, under these circumstances, the angular velocity of the traveller is less than that of the spindle by an amount that is just sufficient to allow the yarn to be wound onto the bobbin at the same rate as that at which it issues from the drafting rollers.

Each revolution of the traveller now inserts one turn of twist into the loop of yarn between the roller nip and the traveller but, in equilibrium, the number of turns of twist in the loop of yarn remains constant as the twisted yarn is passing through the traveller at a corresponding rate.

==Types of fibre==
Artificial fibres are made by extruding a polymer through a spinneret into a medium where it hardens. Wet spinning (rayon) uses a coagulating medium. In dry spinning (acetate and triacetate), the polymer is contained in a solvent that evaporates in the heated exit chamber. In melt spinning (nylons and polyesters) the extruded polymer is cooled in gas or air and sets. All these fibres will be of great length, often kilometers long.

Natural fibres can be divided into three categories: animals (sheep, goat, rabbit, silkworm), minerals (asbestos, gold, silver), or plants (cotton, flax, sisal). These vegetable fibres can come from the seed (cotton), the stem (known as bast fibres: they include flax, hemp, and jute) or the leaf (sisal). Many processes are needed before a clean even staple is obtained. With the exception of silk, each of these fibres is short, only centimetres in length, and each has a rough surface that enables it to bond with similar staples.

Artificial fibres can be processed as long fibres or batched and cut so they can be processed like a natural fibre.

==Methods==
Ring spinning is one of the most common spinning methods in the world. Other systems include air-jet and open-end spinning, a technique where the staple fiber is blown by air into a rotor and attaches to the tail of formed yarn that is continually being drawn out of the chamber. Other methods of break spinning use needles and electrostatic forces.

The processes to make short-staple yarn (typically spun from fibers from ) are blending, opening, carding, pin-drafting, roving, spinning, and—if desired—plying and dyeing. In long staple spinning, the process may start with stretch-break of tow, a continuous &quot;rope&quot; of synthetic fiber. In open-end and air-jet spinning, the roving operation is eliminated. The spinning frame winds yarn around a bobbin. Generally, after this step the yarn is wound to a cone for knitting or weaving.
In a spinning mule, the roving is pulled off bobbins and sequentially fed through rollers operating at several different speeds, thinning the roving at a consistent rate. The yarn is twisted through the spinning of the bobbin as the carriage moves out, and is rolled onto a cop as the carriage returns. Mule spinning produces a finer thread than ring spinning. Spinning by the mule machine is an intermittent process as the frame advances and returns. It is the descendant of a device invented in 1779 by Samuel Crompton, and produces a softer, less twisted thread that is favored for fines and for weft.

The ring was a descendant of the Arkwright water frame of 1769 and creates yarn in a continuous process. The yarn is coarser, has a greater twist, and is stronger, making it more suitable for warp. Ring spinning is slow due to the distance the thread must pass around the ring. Similar methods have improved on this including flyer and bobbin and cap spinning.

The pre-industrial techniques of hand spinning with a spindle or spinning wheel continue to be practiced as handicraft or hobby and enable wool or unusual vegetable and animal staples to be used.
==History and economics==


The origins of hand spinning fibers is unknown, but is believed to have originated separately in several cultures around the world long before the common era. The oldest known twisted fiber was found in southern France, and archaeologists believe it was created around 50,000-40,000 BCE. People are thought to have originally twisted fibers together by rolling them up the thigh or between the fingers, although soon a stick was used to maintain tension and hold the twist in the fibers.
People eventually discovered that adding a weight to the stick, often made of stone, wood, or clay and known as a whorl, helped to maintain momentum and left the hands free to draft the fiber. Whorl spindles are still the predominant method of spinning fiber in some parts of the world.

The cultivation of cotton as well as the knowledge of its spinning and weaving in Meroë reached a high level around the 4th century BC. The export of textiles was one of the sources of wealth for Meroë.

Hand spinning was an important cottage industry in medieval Europe, where the wool spinners (most often women and children) would provide enough yarn to service the needs of the men who operated the looms or to sell on in the putting-out system. After the invention of the spinning jenny water frame the demand was greatly reduced by mechanization. Its technology was specialized and costly and employed water as motive power. Spinning and weaving as cottage industries were displaced by dedicated manufactories, developed by industrialists and their investors; the spinning and weaving industries, once widespread, were concentrated where the sources of water, raw materials, and manpower were most readily available, particularly West Yorkshire. The British government was very protective of the technology and restricted its export. After World War I the colonies where the cotton was grown started to purchase and manufacture significant quantities of cotton spinning machinery. The next breakthrough was with the move over to break or open-end spinning, and then the adoption of artificial fibres. By then most production had moved to Asia.

<text>In the Soviet Union, a Union Republic () or unofficially a Republic of the USSR was a constituent federated political entity with a system of government called a Soviet republic, which was officially defined in the 1977 constitution as &quot;a sovereign Soviet socialist state which has united with the other Soviet republics to form the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics&quot; and whose sovereignty is limited by membership in the Union. As a result of its status as a sovereign state, the Union Republic de jure had the right to enter into relations with foreign states, conclude treaties with them and exchange diplomatic and consular representatives and participate in the activities of international organizations (including membership in international organizations). The Union Republics were perceived as national-based administrative units of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). 

The Soviet Union was formed in 1922 by a treaty between the Soviet republics of Byelorussia, Russian SFSR (RSFSR), Transcaucasian Federation, and Ukraine, by which they became its constituent republics of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (Soviet Union). For most of its history, the USSR was a one-party state led by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Key functions of the USSR were highly centralized in Moscow until its final years, despite its nominal structure as a federation of republics; the light decentralization reforms during the era of &quot;perestroika&quot; (reconstruction) and &quot;glasnost&quot; (voice-ness, as in freedom of speech) conducted by Mikhail Gorbachev as part of the Helsinki Accords are cited as one of the factors which led to the dissolution of the USSR in 1991 as result of the Cold War and the creation of the Commonwealth of Independent States.

The Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, a relic of the Soviet-Finnish War (the Winter War), became the only union republic to be deprived of its status in 1956. The decision to downgrade Karelia to an autonomous republic within the Russian SFSR was made unilaterally by the central government without consulting its population. The official basis for downgrading the status of the republic was the changes that had occurred in the national composition of its population (about 80% of the inhabitants were Russians, Belarusians and Ukrainians), as well as the need to reduce the state apparatus, the cost of maintaining which in 1955 amounted to 19.6 million rubles.

== Overview ==
Chapter 8 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution is titled as the &quot;Soviet Union is a union state&quot;. Article 70 stated that the union was founded on principles &quot;socialist federalism&quot; as a result of free self-determination of nation and volunteer association of equal in rights soviet socialist republics. Article 71 listed all of 15 union republics that united into the Soviet Union.

According to Article 76 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, a Union Republic was a sovereign Soviet socialist state that had united with other Soviet Republics in the USSR. Article 78 of the Constitution stated that the territory of the union republic cannot be changed without its agreement. Article 81 of the Constitution stated that &quot;the sovereign rights of Union Republics shall be safeguarded by the USSR&quot;.

In the final decades of its existence, the Soviet Union officially consisted of fifteen Soviet Socialist Republics (SSRs). All of them, with the exception of the Russian SFSR (until 1990), had their own local party chapters of the All-Union Communist Party.

In 1944, amendments to the All-Union Constitution allowed for separate branches of the Red Army for each Soviet Republic. They also allowed for Republic-level commissariats for foreign affairs and defense, allowing them to be recognized as &quot;de jure&quot; independent states in international law. This allowed for two Soviet Republics, Ukraine and Byelorussia, (as well as the USSR as a whole) to join the United Nations General Assembly as founding members in 1945.

The Soviet currency Soviet ruble banknotes all included writings in national languages of all the 15 union republics.

All of the former Republics of the Union are now independent countries, with ten of them (all except the Baltic states, Georgia and Ukraine) being very loosely organized under the heading of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The Baltic states assert that their incorporation into the Soviet Union in 1940 (as the Lithuanian, Latvian, and Estonian SSRs) under the provisions of the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was illegal, and that they therefore remained independent countries under Soviet occupation. Their position is supported by the European Union, the European Court of Human Rights, the United Nations Human Rights Council and the United States. In contrast, the Russian government and state officials maintain that the Soviet annexation of the Baltic states was legitimate.
Constitutionally, the Soviet Union was a federation. In accordance with provisions present in its Constitution (versions adopted in 1924, 1936 and 1977), each republic retained the right to secede from the USSR. Throughout the Cold War, this right was widely considered to be meaningless; however, the corresponding Article 72 of the 1977 Constitution was used in December 1991 to effectively dissolve the Soviet Union, when Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus seceded from the Union. Although the Union was created under an initial ideological appearance of forming a supranational union, it never de facto functioned as one; an example of the ambiguity is that the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in the 1930s officially had its own foreign minister, but that office did not exercise any true sovereignty apart from that of the union. The Constitution of the Soviet Union in its various iterations defined the union as a federation with the right of the republics to secede. This constitutional status led to the possibility of the parade of sovereignties once the republic with de facto (albeit not de jure) dominance over the other republics, the Russian one, developed a prevailing political notion asserting that it would be better off if it seceded. The de facto dominance of the Russian republic is the reason that various historians (for example, Dmitri Volkogonov and others) have asserted that the union was a unitary state in fact albeit not in law.

In practice, the USSR was a highly centralised entity from its creation in 1922 until the mid-1980s when political forces unleashed by reforms undertaken by Mikhail Gorbachev resulted in the loosening of central control and its ultimate dissolution. Under the constitution adopted in 1936 and modified along the way until October 1977, the political foundation of the Soviet Union was formed by the Soviets (Councils) of People&#x27;s Deputies. These existed at all levels of the administrative hierarchy, with the former &quot;countries&quot; and other regions brought into the union referred to as soviets during their time as republics and with the Soviet Union as a whole under the nominal control of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, located in Moscow within the Russian SFSR.

Along with the state administrative hierarchy, there existed a parallel structure of party organizations, which allowed the Politburo to exercise large amounts of control over the republics. State administrative organs took direction from the parallel party organs, and appointments of all party and state officials required approval of the central organs of the party.

Each republic had its own unique set of state symbols: a flag, a coat of arms, and, with the exception of Russia until 1990, an anthem. Every republic of the Soviet Union also was awarded with the Order of Lenin.
== Union Republics of the Soviet Union ==
The number of the union republics of the USSR varied from 4 to 16. From 1956 until its dissolution in 1991, the Soviet Union consisted of 15 Soviet Socialist Republics. (In 1956, the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic, created in 1940, was absorbed into the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.) Rather than listing the republics in alphabetical order, the republics were listed in constitutional order (which roughly corresponded to their population and economic power when the republics were formed). However, particularly by the last decades of the Soviet Union, the constitutional order did not correspond to order either by population or economic power.

Some of the union republics were autonomous republics before promotion. Soviet historiography considered the establishment of an autonomous republic to be the start of national autonomy and the succeeding union republic a continuation of the same entity in such cases. 

===Short-lived Union Republics of the Soviet Union===
===Non-union Soviet republics===
The Turkestan Soviet Federative Republic was proclaimed in 1918 but did not survive to the founding of the USSR, becoming the short-lived Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of the RSFSR. The Crimean Soviet Socialist Republic (Soviet Socialist Republic of Taurida) was also proclaimed in 1918, but did not become a union republic and was made into an autonomous republic of the RSFSR, although the Crimean Tatars had a relative majority until the 1930s or 1940s according to censuses. When the Tuvan People&#x27;s Republic joined the Soviet Union in 1944, it did not become a union republic, and was instead established as an autonomous republic of the RSFSR.

The leader of the People&#x27;s Republic of Bulgaria, Todor Zhivkov, suggested in the early 1960s that the country should become a union republic, but the offer was rejected. During the Soviet–Afghan War, the Soviet Union proposed to annex Northern Afghanistan as its 16th union republic in what was to become the Afghan Soviet Socialist Republic.

* Galician Soviet Socialist Republic (1920)
* Polish Soviet Socialist Republic (1920)
* East Polish Soviet Socialist Republic (1990)

== Autonomous Republics of the Soviet Union ==

Several of the Union Republics themselves, most notably Russia, were further subdivided into Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics (ASSRs). Though administratively part of their respective Union Republics, ASSRs were also established based on ethnic/cultural lines.

According to the constitution of the USSR, in case of a union republic voting on leaving the Soviet Union, autonomous republics, autonomous oblasts and autonomous okrugs had the right, by means of a referendum, to independently resolve whether they will stay in the USSR or leave with the seceding union republic, as well as to raise the issue of their state-legal status.

== Dissolution of the Soviet Union ==
Starting in the late 1980s, under the rule of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet government undertook a program of political reforms (&quot;glasnost&quot; and &quot;perestroika&quot;) intended to liberalise and revitalise the Union. These measures, however, had a number of unintended political and social effects. Political liberalisation allowed the governments of the union republics to openly invoke the principles of democracy and nationalism to gain legitimacy. In addition, the loosening of political restrictions led to fractures within the Communist Party which resulted in a reduced ability to govern the Union effectively. The rise of nationalist and right-wing movements, notably led by Boris Yeltsin in Russia, in the previously homogeneous political system undermined the Union&#x27;s foundations. With the central role of the Communist Party removed from the constitution, the Party lost its control over the State machinery and was banned from operating after an attempted coup d&#x27;état.

Throughout this period of turmoil, the Soviet government attempted to find a new structure that would reflect the increased authority of the republics. Some autonomous republics, like Tatarstan, Checheno-Ingushetia, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Crimea, Transnistria, Gagauzia sought the union statute in the New Union Treaty. Efforts to found a New Union Treaty, however, proved unsuccessful and the republics began to secede from the Union. By 6 September 1991, the Soviet Union&#x27;s State Council recognized the independence of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania bringing the number of union republics down to 12. On 8 December 1991, the remaining leaders of the republics signed the Belavezha Accords which agreed that the USSR would be dissolved and replaced with a Commonwealth of Independent States. On 25 December, President Gorbachev announced his resignation and turned all executive powers over to Yeltsin. The next day the Council of Republics voted to dissolve the Union. Since then, the republics have been governed independently with some reconstituting themselves as liberal parliamentary republics and others, particularly in Central Asia, devolving into highly autocratic states under the leadership of the old Party elite.

<text>Systemic [[scleroderma]], or systemic sclerosis, is an autoimmune rheumatic disease characterised by excessive production and accumulation of collagen, called fibrosis, in the skin and internal organs and by injuries to small arteries. There are two major subgroups of systemic sclerosis based on the extent of skin involvement: limited and diffuse. The limited form affects areas below, but not above, the elbows and knees with or without involvement of the face. The diffuse form also affects the skin above the elbows and knees and can also spread to the torso. Visceral organs, including the kidneys, heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract can also be affected by the fibrotic process.
Prognosis is determined by the form of the disease and the extent of visceral involvement. Patients with limited systemic sclerosis have a better prognosis than those with the diffuse form. Death is most often caused by lung, heart, and kidney involvement. The risk of cancer is increased slightly.

Survival rates have greatly increased with effective treatment for kidney failure. Therapies include immunosuppressive drugs, and in some cases, glucocorticoids.

==Signs and symptoms==
Calcinosis, Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon, Esophageal dysfunction, Sclerodactyly, and Telangiectasia (CREST syndrome) are associated with limited scleroderma. Other symptoms include:

===Skin symptoms===
In the skin, systemic sclerosis causes hardening and scarring. The skin may appear tight, reddish, or scaly. Blood vessels may also be more visible. Where large areas are affected, fat and muscle wastage may weaken limbs and affect appearance. Patients report severe and recurrent itching of large skin areas. The severity of these symptoms varies greatly among patients: Some having scleroderma of only a limited area of the skin (such as the fingers) and little involvement of the underlying tissue, while others have progressive skin involvement. Digital ulcers—open wounds especially on fingertips and less commonly the knuckles—are not uncommon.

===Other organs===
Diffuse scleroderma can cause musculoskeletal, pulmonary, gastrointestinal, renal, and other complications. Patients with greater cutaneous involvement are more likely to have involvement of the internal tissues and organs. Most patients (over 80%) have vascular symptoms and Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon, which leads to attacks of discoloration of the hands and feet in response to cold. Raynaud&#x27;s normally affects the fingers and toes. Systemic scleroderma and Raynaud&#x27;s can cause painful ulcers on the fingers or toes, which are known as digital ulcers. Calcinosis (deposition of calcium in lumps under the skin) is also common in systemic scleroderma, and is often seen near the elbows, knees, or other joints.

;Musculoskeletal
The first joint symptoms that patients with scleroderma have are typically nonspecific joint pains, which can lead to arthritis, or cause discomfort in tendons or muscles. Joint mobility, especially of the small joints of the hand, may be restricted by calcinosis or skin thickening. Patients may develop muscle weakness, or myopathy, either from the disease or its treatments.

;Lungs
Some impairment in lung function is almost universally seen in patients with diffuse scleroderma on pulmonary function testing, but it does not necessarily cause symptoms, such as shortness of breath. Some patients can develop pulmonary hypertension, or elevation in the pressures of the pulmonary arteries. This can be progressive, and can lead to right-sided heart failure. The earliest manifestation of this may be a decreased diffusion capacity on pulmonary function testing. Other pulmonary complications in more advanced disease include aspiration pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage and pneumothorax.

;Digestive tract

Diffuse scleroderma can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. The most common manifestation in the esophagus is reflux esophagitis, which may be complicated by esophageal strictures or benign narrowing of the esophagus. This is best initially treated with proton pump inhibitors for acid suppression, but may require bougie dilatation in the case of stricture.

Scleroderma can decrease motility anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. The most common source of decreased motility is the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter, leading to dysphagia and chest pain. As scleroderma progresses, esophageal involvement from abnormalities in decreased motility may worsen due to progressive fibrosis (scarring). If this is left untreated, acid from the stomach can back up into the esophagus, causing esophagitis and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Further scarring from acid damage to the lower esophagus many times leads to the development of fibrotic narrowing, also known as strictures, which can be treated by dilatation.

In patients with neuromuscular disorders, particularly progressive systemic sclerosis and visceral myopathy, the duodenum is frequently involved. Dilatation may occur, which is often more pronounced in the second, third, and fourth parts. The dilated duodenum may be slow to empty, and the grossly dilated, atonic organ may produce a sump effect.

The small intestine can also become involved, leading to bacterial overgrowth and malabsorption of bile salts, fats, carbohydrates, proteins, and vitamins. The colon can be involved, and can cause pseudo-obstruction or ischemic colitis.

Rarer complications include pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis, or gas pockets in the bowel wall, wide-mouthed diverticula in the colon and esophagus, and liver fibrosis. Patients with severe gastrointestinal involvement can become profoundly malnourished.

Scleroderma may also be associated with gastric antral vascular ectasia, also known as &quot;watermelon stomach&quot;. This is a condition in which atypical blood vessels proliferate, usually in a radially symmetric pattern around the pylorus of the stomach. It can be a cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding or iron-deficiency anemia in patients with scleroderma.

;Kidneys

Kidney involvement, in scleroderma, is considered a poor prognostic factor and frequently a cause of death.

The most important clinical complication of scleroderma involving the kidney is scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), the symptoms of which are malignant hypertension (high blood pressure with evidence of acute organ damage), hyperreninemia (high renin levels), azotemia (kidney failure with accumulation of waste products in the blood), and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (destruction of red blood cells). Apart from the high blood pressure, hematuria (blood in the urine) and proteinuria (protein loss in the urine) may be indicative of SRC.

In the past, SRC was almost uniformly fatal. While outcomes have improved significantly with the use of ACE inhibitors, the prognosis is often guarded, as a significant number of patients are refractory to treatment and develop kidney failure. About 7–9% of all diffuse cutaneous scleroderma patients develop renal crisis at some point in the course of their disease. Patients who have rapid skin involvement have the highest risk of renal complications. It is most common in diffuse cutaneous scleroderma, and is often associated with antibodies against RNA polymerase (in 59% of cases). Many proceed to dialysis, although this can be stopped within three years in about a third of cases. Higher age and (paradoxically) a lower blood pressure at presentation make dialysis more likely to be needed.

Treatments for SRC include ACE inhibitors. Prophylactic use of ACE inhibitors is currently not recommended, as recent data suggest a poorer prognosis in patient treated with these drugs prior to the development of renal crisis. Transplanted kidneys are known to be affected by scleroderma, and patients with early-onset renal disease (within one year of the scleroderma diagnosis) are thought to have the highest risk for recurrence.

==Causes==
No clear cause for scleroderma and systemic sclerosis has been identified. Genetic predisposition appears to be limited, as genetic concordance is small; still, a familial predisposition for autoimmune disease is often seen. Polymorphisms in &quot;COL1A2&quot; and &quot;TGF-β1&quot; may influence severity and development of the disease. Evidence implicating cytomegalovirus (CMV) as the original epitope of the immune reaction is limited, as is parvovirus B19. Organic solvents and other chemical agents have been linked with scleroderma.

One of the suspected mechanisms behind the autoimmune phenomenon is the existence of microchimerism, i.e. fetal cells circulating in maternal blood, triggering an immune reaction to what is perceived as foreign material.

A distinct form of scleroderma and systemic sclerosis may develop in patients with chronic kidney failure. This form, nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy or nephrogenic systemic fibrosis, has been linked to exposure to gadolinium-containing radiocontrast.

Bleomycin (a chemotherapeutic agent) and possibly taxane chemotherapy may cause scleroderma, and occupational exposure to solvents has been linked to an increased risk of systemic sclerosis.

==Pathophysiology==
Overproduction of collagen is thought to result from an autoimmune dysfunction, in which the immune system starts to attack the kinetochore of the chromosomes. This would lead to genetic malfunction of nearby genes. T cells accumulate in the skin; these are thought to secrete cytokines and other proteins that stimulate collagen deposition. Stimulation of the fibroblast, in particular, seems to be crucial to the disease process, and studies have converged on the potential factors that produce this effect.

A significant player in the process is transforming growth factor (TGFβ). This protein appears to be overproduced, and the fibroblast (possibly in response to other stimuli) also overexpresses the receptor for this mediator. An intracellular pathway (consisting of &quot;SMAD2&quot;/&quot;SMAD3&quot;, &quot;SMAD4&quot;, and the inhibitor &quot;SMAD7&quot;) is responsible for the secondary messenger system that induces transcription of the proteins and enzymes responsible for collagen deposition. &quot;Sp1&quot; is a transcription factor most closely studied in this context. Apart from TGFβ, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) has a possible role. Indeed, a common &quot;CTGF&quot; gene polymorphism is present at an increased level in systemic sclerosis.

Damage to endothelium is an early abnormality in the development of scleroderma, and this, too, seems to be due to collagen accumulation by fibroblasts, although direct alterations by cytokines, platelet adhesion, and a type II hypersensitivity reaction similarly have been implicated. Increased endothelin and decreased vasodilation have been documented.

Jimenez and Derk describe three theories about the development of scleroderma:
* The abnormalities are primarily due to a physical agent, and all other changes are secondary or reactive to this direct insult.
* The initial event is fetomaternal cell transfer causing microchimerism, with a second summative cause (e.g. environmental) leading to the actual development of the disease.
* Physical causes lead to phenotypic alterations in susceptible cells (e.g. due to genetic makeup), which then effectuate DNA changes that alter the cells&#x27; behavior.

==Diagnosis==
In 1980, the American College of Rheumatology agreed on diagnostic criteria for scleroderma.

Diagnosis is by clinical suspicion, presence of autoantibodies (specifically anticentromere and anti-scl70/antitopoisomerase antibodies), and occasionally by biopsy. Of the antibodies, 90% have a detectable antinuclear antibody. Anticentromere antibody is more common in the limited form (80–90%) than in the diffuse form (10%), and anti-scl70 is more common in the diffuse form (30–40%) and in African-American patients (who are more susceptible to the systemic form).

Other conditions may mimic systemic sclerosis by causing hardening of the skin. Diagnostic hints that another disorder is responsible include the absence of Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon, a lack of abnormalities in the skin on the hands, a lack of internal organ involvement, and a normal antinuclear antibodies test result.

== Treatment ==
No cure for scleroderma is known, though treatments exist for some of the symptoms, including drugs that soften the skin and reduce inflammation. Some patients may benefit from exposure to heat. Holistic care of patients comprising patient education tailored to patients&#x27; education level is useful in view of the complex nature of the disease symptoms and progress.

===Topical/symptomatic===
Topical treatment for the skin changes of scleroderma do not alter the disease course, but may improve pain and ulceration. A range of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as naproxen, can be used to ease painful symptoms. The benefit from steroids such as prednisone is limited. Episodes of Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon sometimes respond to nifedipine or other calcium channel blockers; severe digital ulceration may respond to prostacyclin analogue iloprost, and the dual endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan may be beneficial for Raynaud&#x27;s phenomenon. Skin tightness may be treated systemically with methotrexate and ciclosporin. and the skin thickness can be treated with penicillamine.

===Kidney disease===
Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a life-threatening complication of systemic sclerosis that may be the initial manifestation of the disease.  Renal vascular injury (due in part to collagen deposition) leads to renal ischemia, which results in activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).  This raises blood pressure and further damages the renal vasculature, causing a vicious cycle of worsening hypertension and renal dysfunction (e.g., elevated creatinine, edema).  Hypertensive emergency with end-organ dysfunction (e.g., encephalopathy, retinal hemorrhage) is common.  Thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia can be seen.  Urinalysis is usually normal but may show mild proteinuria, as in this patient; casts are unexpected.

The mainstay of therapy for SRC includes ACE inhibitors, which reduce RAAS activity and improve renal function and blood pressure.  Short-acting ACE inhibitors (typically captopril) are used because they can be rapidly uptitrated.  An elevated serum creatinine level is not a contraindication for ACE inhibitors in this population, and slight elevations in creatinine are common during drug initiation.

Scleroderma renal crisis, the occurrence of acute kidney injury, and malignant hypertension (very high blood pressure with evidence of organ damage) in people with scleroderma are effectively treated with drugs from the class of the ACE inhibitors. The benefit of ACE inhibitors extends even to those who have to commence dialysis to treat their kidney disease, and may give sufficient benefit to allow the discontinuation of renal replacement therapy.

===Lung disease===
Active alveolitis is often treated with pulses of cyclophosphamide, often together with a small dose of steroids. The benefit of this intervention is modest.

Pulmonary hypertension may be treated with epoprostenol, treprostinil, bosentan, and possibly aerolized iloprost. Nintedanib was approved for use in the United States Food and Drug Administration on September 6, 2019, to slow the rate of decline in pulmonary function in patients with systemic sclerosis-associated interstitial lung disease (SSc-ILD).

===Other===
Some evidence indicates that plasmapheresis (therapeutic plasma exchange) can be used to treat the systemic form of scleroderma. In Italy, it is a government-approved treatment option. This is done by replacing blood plasma with a fluid consisting of albumin, and is thought to keep the disease at bay by reducing the circulation of scleroderma autoantibodies.

== Epidemiology ==
Systemic scleroderma is a rare disease, with an annual incidence that varies in different populations. Estimates of incidence (new cases per million people) range from 3.7 to 43 in the United Kingdom and Europe, 7.2 in Japan, 10.9 in Taiwan, 12.0 to 22.8 in Australia, 13.9 to 21.0 in the United States, and 21.2 in Buenos Aires. The interval of peak onset starts at age 30 and ends at age 50.

Globally, estimates of prevalence vary from 31.0 to 658.6 affected people per million. Systemic sclerosis has a female:male ratio of 3:1 (8:1 in mid- to late childbearing years). Incidence is twice as high among African Americans. Full-blooded Choctaw Native Americans in Oklahoma have the highest prevalence in the world (469 per 100,000).

The disease has some hereditary association. It may also be caused by an immune reaction to a virus (molecular mimicry) or by toxins.

== Society and culture ==

===Support groups===
The Juvenile Scleroderma Network is an organization dedicated to providing emotional support and educational information to parents and their children living with juvenile scleroderma, supporting pediatric research to identify the cause of and the cure for juvenile scleroderma, and enhancing public awareness.

In the US, the Scleroderma Foundation is dedicated to raise awareness of the disease and assist those who are affected.

The Scleroderma Research Foundation sponsors research into the condition. Comedian and television presenter Bob Saget, a board member of the SRF, directed the 1996 ABC TV movie &quot;For Hope&quot;, starring Dana Delany, which depicts a young woman fatally affected by scleroderma; the film was based on the experiences of Saget&#x27;s sister Gay.

Scleroderma and Raynaud&#x27;s UK is a British charity formed by the merger of two smaller organisations in 2016 to provide support for people with scleroderma and fund research into the condition.

==Prognosis==
A 2018 study placed 10-year survival rates at 88%, without differentiation based on subtype. Diffuse systemic sclerosis, internal organ complications, and older age at diagnosis are associated with worse prognoses.

==Research==
Given the difficulty in treating scleroderma, treatments with a smaller evidence base are often tried to control the disease. These include antithymocyte globulin and mycophenolate mofetil; some reports have shown improvements in the skin symptoms, as well as delaying the progress of systemic disease, but neither has been subjected to large clinical trials.

Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is based on the assumption that autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis occur when the white blood cells of the immune system attack the body. In this treatment, stem cells from the patient&#x27;s blood are extracted and stored to preserve them. The patient&#x27;s white blood cells are destroyed with cyclophosphamide and rabbit antibodies against the white blood cells. Then, the stored blood is returned to the patient&#x27;s bloodstream to reconstitute a healthy blood and immune system that will not attack the body. The results of a phase-III trial, the Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation International Scleroderma (ASTIS) trial, with 156 patients, were published in 2014. HSCT itself has a high treatment mortality, so in the first year, the survival of patients in the treatment group was lower than the placebo group, but at the end of 10 years, the survival in the treatment group was significantly higher. The authors concluded that HSCT could be effective, if limited to patients who were healthy enough to survive HSCT itself. Therefore, HSCT should be given early in the progression of the disease, before it does damage. Patients with heart disease, and patients who smoked cigarettes, were less likely to survive. Another trial, the Stem Cell Transplant vs. Cyclophosphamide (SCOT) trial, is ongoing.

Asengeprast is an experimental systemic scleroderma drug candidate. It is a small molecule inhibitor of the G-protein coupled receptor GPR68 with antifibrotic activity.

<doc id="26952" wikidata="Q3429239" url="?curid=26952" title="Slave narrative">
<text>The slave narrative is a type of literary genre involving the (written) autobiographical accounts of enslaved persons, particularly Africans enslaved in the Americas, though many other examples exist. Over six thousand such narratives are estimated to exist; about 150 narratives were published as separate books or pamphlets. In the United States during the Great Depression (1930s), more than 2,300 additional oral histories on life during slavery were collected by writers sponsored and published by the Works Progress Administration, a New Deal program. Most of the 26 audio-recorded interviews are held by the Library of Congress.

Some of the earliest memoirs of captivity known in the English-speaking world were written by white Europeans and later Americans, captured and sometimes enslaved in North Africa by local Muslims, usually Barbary pirates. These were part of a broad category of &quot;captivity narratives&quot;. Beginning in the 17th century, these included accounts by colonists and later American settlers in North America and the United States who were captured and held by Native Americans. Several well-known captivity narratives were published before the American Revolution, and they often followed forms established with the narratives of captivity in North Africa. North African accounts did not continue to appear after the Napoleonic Era; accounts from North Americans, captured by western tribes migrating west continued until the end of the 19th century.

Given the problem of international contemporary slavery in the 20th and 21st centuries, additional slave narratives are being written and published.

==As a literary genre==
The development of slave narratives from autobiographical accounts to modern fictional works led to the establishment of slave narratives as a literary genre. This large rubric of this so-called &quot;captivity literature&quot; includes more generally &quot;any account of the life, or a major portion of the life, of a fugitive or former slave, either written or orally related by the slave himself or herself&quot;. Whereas the first narratives told the stories of fugitive or freed slaves in a time of racial prejudice, they further developed into retrospective fictional novels and extended their influence until common days. Not only maintaining the memory and capturing the historical truth transmitted in these accounts, but slave narratives were primarily the tool for fugitive or former slaves to state their independence in the 19th century, and carry on and conserve authentic and true historical facts from a first-person perspective. They go further than just autobiographies, and are moreover &quot;a source for reconstructing historical experience&quot;. The freed slaves that wrote the narratives are considered as historians, since &quot;memory and history come together&quot;. These accounts link elements of the slave&#x27;s personal life and destiny with key historical phenomena, such as the American Civil War and the Underground Railroad.

In simple, yet powerful storylines, slave narratives follow in general a plot common to all of them: starting from the initial situation, the slave in his master&#x27;s home, the protagonist escapes in the wilderness and narrates the struggle for survival and recognition throughout his uncertain journey to freedom. After all, these narratives were written retrospectively by freed slaves and/or their abolitionist advocate, hence the focus on the transformation from the dehumanized slave to the self-emancipated free man. This change often entailed literacy as a means to overcome captivity, as the case of Frederick Douglass highlights. The narratives are very graphic to the extent as extensive accounts of e.g. whipping, abuse and rape of enslaved women are exposed in detail (see Treatment of slaves in the United States). The denunciation of the slave owners, in particular their cruelty and hypocrisy, is a recurring theme in slave narratives, and in some examples denounced the double standards (e.g. in Douglass&#x27;s narrative, his slave owner Hopkins is a very religious, but also brutal man).

According to James Olney, a typical outline looks the following way:

There is no consensus about what exact type of literature slave narratives are, whether they can be considered as a proper genre, comprised in the large category captivity narrative, or are autobiographies, memoirs, testimonials, or novels; nonetheless, they play a big part in keeping up the memory of slavery and in approaching a topic that was considered as a taboo for a long time – especially since many denied and still deny the existence of slavery. Given the participation in the 19th century of abolitionist editors (at least in the United States), influential early 20th-century historians, such as Ulrich B. Phillips in 1929, suggested that, as a class, &quot;their authenticity was doubtful&quot;. These doubts have been criticized following better academic research of these narratives, since the late 20th-century historians have more often validated the accounts of slaves about their own experiences.

==North American slave narratives==
Slave narratives by African slaves from North America were first published in England in the 18th century. They soon became the main form of African-American literature in the 19th century. Slave narratives were publicized by abolitionists, who sometimes participated as editors, or writers if slaves were not literate. During the first half of the 19th century, the controversy over slavery in the United States led to impassioned literature on both sides of the issue.

To present the reality of slavery, a number of former slaves, such as Harriet Tubman, Harriet Jacobs, and Frederick Douglass, published accounts of their enslavement and their escapes to freedom. Lucy Delaney wrote an account that included the freedom suit waged by her mother in Missouri for their freedom. Eventually some 6,000 former slaves from North America and the Caribbean wrote accounts of their lives, and over 100 book-length accounts were published from formerly enslaved people worldwide.

Before the American Civil War, some authors wrote fictional accounts of slavery to create support for abolitionism. The prime example is &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852) by Harriet Beecher Stowe. The success of her novel and the social tensions of the time brought a response by white Southern writers, such as William Gilmore Simms and Mary Eastman, who published what were called anti-Tom novels. Both kinds of novels were bestsellers in the 1850s.

===Tales of religious redemption===
From the 1770s to the 1820s, slave narratives generally gave an account of a spiritual journey leading to Christian redemption. The authors usually characterized themselves as Africans rather than slaves, as most were born in Africa.

Examples include:
* Ukawsaw Gronniosaw, &quot;A Narrative of the Most Remarkable Particulars in the Life of James Albert &quot;Ukawsaw Gronniosaw&quot;, an African Prince&quot;, Bath, England, 1772
* Olaudah Equiano, &quot;The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano&quot;, London, 1789
* Venture Smith, &quot;A Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Venture, a Native of Africa: But Resident Above Sixty Years in the United States of America&quot;, New London, 1798
* Jeffrey Brace, &quot;The Blind African Slave, Or Memoirs of Boyrereau Brinch, Nicknamed Jeffrey Brace&quot;, as told to Benjamin F. Prentiss, Esq., St. Albans, Vermont, 1810; edited and with an introduction by Kari J. Winter, Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press, 2004, 
* John Jea, &quot;The Life, History, and Unparalleled Sufferings of John Jea, the African Preacher&quot;, 1811
* Greensbury Washington Offley, &quot;A Narrative of the Life and Labors of the Rev. G. W. Offley, a Colored Man, Local Preacher and Missionary&quot;, 1859

Some more recent narratives, such as Petro Kilekwa&#x27;s &quot;Slave Boy to Priest: The Autobiography of Padre Petro Kilekwa&quot; (1937), followed a similar theme.

===Tales to inspire the abolitionist movement===
From the mid-1820s, writers consciously chose the autobiographical form to generate enthusiasms for the abolitionist movement. Some writers adopted literary techniques, including the use of fictionalized dialogue. Between 1835 and 1865 more than 80 such narratives were published. Recurrent features include: slave auctions, the break-up of families, and frequently two accounts of escapes, one of which is successful. As this was the period of the forced migration of an estimated one million slaves from the Upper South to the Deep South through the internal slave trade, the experiences of auctions and separation of families were common to many.

Examples include:
* William Grimes, &quot;Life of William Grimes, the Runaway Slave&quot;, New York, 1825

* Wallace Turnage, the second man whose narrative of emancipation was published in Blight, David W., &quot;A Slave No More: Two Men Who Escaped to Freedom, Including Their Own Narratives of Emancipation&quot;.

===Tales of progress===
Following the defeat of the slave states of the Confederate South, the authors had less need to convey the evils of slavery. Some gave a sentimental account of plantation life and ended with the narrator adjusting to the new life of freedom. The emphasis of writers shifted conceptually toward a recounting of individual and racial progress rather than securing freedom.

Examples include:
* James Mars, &quot;The Life of James Mars, A Slave Born and Sold in Connecticut&quot;, Hartford, 1864
* Paul Jennings, &quot;A Colored Man&#x27;s Reminiscences of James Madison&quot;, 1865

* Booker T. Washington, &quot;Up From Slavery&quot;, Garden City, New York, 1901
* Sam Aleckson, &quot;Before the War, and After the Union: An Autobiography&quot;, Boston, 1929

===WPA slave narratives===
During the Great Depression of the 1930s, the New Deal Works Projects Administration (WPA) employed writers and researchers from the Federal Writers&#x27; Project to interview and document the stories of African Americans who were former slaves. Most had been children when the Thirteenth Amendment was passed. Produced between 1936 and 1938, the narratives recount the experiences of more than 2,300 former slaves. Some interviews were recorded; 23 of 26 known audio recordings are held by the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress. The last interview of a former slave was with Fountain Hughes, then 101, in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1949. He was a grandson of a slave owned by President Thomas Jefferson at Monticello.

=== North American slave narratives as travel literature ===
Slave narratives inherently involved travel and form a significant type of travel writing. As John Cox says in &quot;Traveling South&quot;, &quot;travel was a necessary prelude to the publication of a narrative by a slave, for slavery could not be simultaneously experienced and written.&quot; Where many travel narratives are written by privileged travelers, slave narratives show people traveling despite significant legal barriers to their actions, and in this way are a distinct and essential element in how travel narratives formed the American character.

==North African slave narratives==
In comparison to North American and Caribbean slave narratives, the North African slave narratives in English were written by British and American white slaves captured (often at sea or through Barbary pirates) and enslaved in North Africa in the 18th and early 19th centuries. These narratives have a distinct form in that they highlight the &quot;otherness&quot; of the Muslim slave traders, whereas the African-American slave narratives often call slave traders to account as fellow Christians.

Narratives focused on the central themes of freedom and liberty which drew inspiration from the American Revolution. Since the narratives include the recurrence of themes and events, quoting, and relying heavily upon each other it is believed by scholars that the main source of information was other narratives more so than real captivities. Female captives were depicted as Gothic fiction characters clinging to the hope of freedom thus more relatable to the audience.

Examples include:
* &quot;A True and Faithful Account of the Religion and Manners of the Mahometans&quot; by Joseph Pitts (1663–1735) tells his capture as a boy age 14 or 15 by pirates while fishing off Newfoundland. His sale as a slave and his life under three different masters in North Africa, and his travels to Mecca are all described.
* &quot;Tyrkja-Gudda&quot;, 1952 and 2001
* Thomas Pellow, &quot;The History of the Long Captivity and Adventures of Thomas Pellow, In South Barbary&quot;, 1740
* &quot;A Curious, Historical and Entertaining Narrative of the Captivity and almost unheard of Sufferings and Cruel treatment of Mr Robert White&quot;, 1790
* &quot;A Journal of the Captivity and Suffering of John Foss; Several Years a Prisoner in Algiers&quot;, 1798
* &quot;History of the Captivity and Sufferings of Mrs Maria Martin who was six years a slave in Algiers; two of which she was confined in a dismal dungeon, loaded with irons, by the command of an inhuman Turkish officer. Written by herself. To which is added, a concise history of Algiers, with the manners and customs of the people,&quot; 1812
* Captain James Riley, &quot;Sufferings in Africa&quot;, 1815 
* &quot;The Narrative of Robert Adams, An American Sailor who was wrecked on the West Coast of Africa in the year 1810; was detained Three Years in Slavery by the Arabs of the Great Desert&quot;, 1816
* James Leander Cathcart, &quot;The Captives, Eleven Years a Prisoner in Algiers&quot;, published in 1899, many years after his captivity

Maria ter Meetelen (1704 in Amsterdam – fl. 1751), was a Dutch writer of an autobiography. Her biography is considered to be a valuable witness statement of the life of a former slave (1748).
* Maria ter Meetelen, &quot;The Curious and Amazing Adventures of Maria ter Meetelen; Twelve Years a Slave (1731- 43)&quot;, Translated and Introduced by Caroline Stone. (Hardinge Simpole, 2010) .

==Women&#x27;s slave narratives==
Narratives by enslaved women include the memoirs of Harriet Jacobs, Mary Prince, Mattie J. Jackson, and &quot;old Elizabeth,&quot; among others.

In her narrative, Mary Prince, a Bermuda-born woman and slave discusses her deep connection with her master&#x27;s wife and the pity she felt for the wife as she witnessed the &quot;ill-treatment&quot; the wife suffered at the hands of her husband. Prince was taught to read by Moravian missionaries. Literacy, however, was not a common theme for all enslaved women. The life story of &quot;old Elizabeth&quot; was transcribed from her oral account at the age of 97.

==Other historical slave narratives==
As slavery has been practiced all over the world for millennia, some narratives cover places and times other than these main two. One example is the account given by John R. Jewitt, an English armourer enslaved for years by Maquinna of the Nootka people in the Pacific Northwest. The &quot;Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; calls his memoir a &quot;classic of captivity literature&quot; and it is a rich source of information about the indigenous people of Vancouver Island.
*&quot;Narrative of the Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt, only survivor of the crew of the ship Boston, during a captivity of nearly three years among the savages of Nootka Sound: with an account of the manners, mode of living, and religious opinions of the natives.&quot; Middletown, Connecticut, printed by Loomis and Richards, 1815

Macuncuzade Mustafa Efendi, an Ottoman qadi, poet, and slave owner who was captured by the Hospitaller fleet off Cyprus in 1597 and was enslaved in Hospitaller Malta until he was ransomed in 1600, wrote a narrative entitled &quot;Baz Kest-i Hakiri-i Malta Sergiizess-i Esiri-i Malta&quot; based on notes and poems he had composed while imprisoned. A manuscript copy of it made by a scribe named Omer in 1602 is preserved at the Hacı Selim Ağa Library in Üsküdar, and its text was published in the 20th century. It is regarded as an important primary source about slavery in Malta.

==Contemporary slave narratives==

===Nonfiction===
A contemporary slave narrative is a recent memoir written by a former slave, or ghost-written on their behalf. Modern areas of the world in which slavery occurs include the Sudan. &quot;Escape from Slavery: The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity – and My Journey to Freedom in America&quot; (2003) by Francis Bok and Edward Tivnan, and &quot;Slave&quot; by Mende Nazer and Damien Lewis, describe from slavery experiences in the Sudan.

&quot;Another Slave Narrative&quot;, a film series, was launched by filmmaker Michelle Jackson on December 18, 2016. Jackson, inspired by an interview with a former slave, decided to present the stories of previously enslaved people in a series of short films. A cast of 22 actors of mixed sex, race, and age, read out individual slaves&#x27; interviews from the Slave Narrative Collection which includes more than 2,300 interviews conducted from 1936–38. Jackson&#x27;s aim is to document every single fate and hence approach the taboo of slavery, and keep the memory of the slaves alive through these videos.

===Fictional===
&quot;The Underground Railroad&quot; by National Book Award winner Colson Whitehead takes place in an alternative version of the 19th century. Cora, a slave on a cotton farm in Georgia escapes via the Underground Railroad. The novel was well received. It was said to possess &quot;the chilling, matter-of-fact power of the slave narratives collected by the Federal Writers&#x27; Project in the 1930s, with echoes of Toni Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Beloved&quot;&quot; and could be considered as a modern-tale fictional slave narrative.

==Neo-slave narratives==
A neo-slave narrative — a term coined by Ishmael Reed while working on his 1976 novel Flight to Canada and used by him in a 1984 interview — is a modern fictional work set in the slavery era by contemporary authors or substantially concerned with depicting the experience or the effects of enslavement in the New World. The works are largely classified as novels, but may pertain to poetical works as well. The renaissance of the postmodern slave narratives in the 20th century was a means to deal retrospectively with slavery, and to give a fictional account of historical facts from the first-person perspective.
