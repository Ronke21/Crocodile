<text>Paul Laurence Dunbar (June 27, 1872 – February 9, 1906) was an American poet, novelist, and short story writer of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Born in Dayton, Ohio, to parents who had been enslaved in Kentucky before the American Civil War, Dunbar began writing stories and verse when he was a child. He published his first poems at the age of 16 in a Dayton newspaper, and served as president of his high school&#x27;s literary society.

Dunbar&#x27;s popularity increased rapidly after his work was praised by William Dean Howells, a leading editor associated with &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. Dunbar became one of the first African-American writers to establish an international reputation. In addition to his poems, short stories, and novels, he also wrote the lyrics for the musical comedy &quot;In Dahomey&quot; (1903), the first all-African-American musical produced on Broadway in New York. The musical later toured in the United States and the United Kingdom. Suffering from tuberculosis, which then had no cure, Dunbar died in Dayton, Ohio, at the age of 33.

Much of Dunbar&#x27;s more popular work in his lifetime was written in the &quot;Negro dialect&quot; associated with the antebellum South, though he also used the Midwestern regional dialect of James Whitcomb Riley. Dunbar also wrote in conventional English in other poetry and novels and is considered the first important African American sonnet writer. Since the late 20th century, scholars have become more interested in these other works.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Paul Laurence Dunbar was born at 311 Howard Street in Dayton, Ohio, on June 27, 1872, to parents who were enslaved in Kentucky before the American Civil War. After being emancipated, his mother Matilda moved to Dayton with other family members, including her two sons Robert and William from her first marriage. Dunbar&#x27;s father Joshua escaped from slavery in Kentucky before the war ended. He traveled to Massachusetts and volunteered for the 55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, one of the first two black units to serve in the war. The senior Dunbar also served in the 5th Massachusetts Cavalry Regiment. Paul Dunbar was born six months after Joshua and Matilda&#x27;s wedding on Christmas Eve, 1871.

The marriage of Dunbar&#x27;s parents was troubled, and Dunbar&#x27;s mother left Joshua soon after having their second child, a daughter. Joshua died on August 16, 1885, when Paul was 13 years old.

Dunbar wrote his first poem at the age of six and gave his first public recital at the age of nine. His mother assisted him in his schooling, having learned to read expressly for that purpose. She often read the Bible with him, and thought he might become a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. It was the first independent black denomination in America, founded in Philadelphia in the early 19th century.

Dunbar was the only African-American student during his years at Central High School in Dayton. Orville Wright was a classmate and friend. Well-accepted, he was elected as president of the school&#x27;s literary society, and became the editor of the school newspaper and a debate club member.

===Writing career===

At the age of 16, Dunbar published the poems &quot;Our Martyred Soldiers&quot; and &quot;On The River&quot; in 1888 in Dayton&#x27;s &quot;The Herald&quot; newspaper. In 1890, Dunbar wrote and edited &quot;The Tattler&quot;, Dayton&#x27;s first weekly African-American newspaper. It was printed by the fledgling company of his high-school acquaintances, Wilbur and Orville Wright. The paper lasted six weeks.

After completing his formal schooling in 1891, Dunbar took a job as an elevator operator, earning a salary of four dollars a week. He had hoped to study law, but was not able to because of his mother&#x27;s limited finances. He was restricted at work because of racial discrimination. Dunbar was an elevator attendant in the same building in which Eva Best&#x27;s father conducted an architect&#x27;s office, and she became acquainted with Dunbar and his literary endeavors through seeing him in her father&#x27;s building. She was among the first persons to recognize the poetry of Dunbar and was influential in bringing him before the public.

In 1892, Dunbar asked the Wrights to publish his dialect poems in book form, but the brothers did not have a facility that could print books. They suggested he go to the United Brethren Publishing House which, in 1893, printed Dunbar&#x27;s first collection of poetry, &quot;Oak and Ivy&quot;. Dunbar subsidized the printing of the book, and quickly earned back his investment in two weeks by selling copies personally, often to passengers on his elevator.

The larger section of the book, the &quot;Oak&quot; section, consisted of traditional verse, whereas the smaller section, the &quot;Ivy&quot;, featured light poems written in dialect. The work attracted the attention of James Whitcomb Riley, the popular &quot;Hoosier Poet&quot;. Both Riley and Dunbar wrote poems in both standard English and dialect.

His literary gifts were recognized, and older men offered to help him financially. Attorney Charles A. Thatcher offered to pay for college, but Dunbar wanted to persist with writing, as he was encouraged by his sales of poetry. Thatcher helped promote Dunbar, arranging work to read his poetry in the larger city of Toledo at &quot;libraries and literary gatherings.&quot; In addition, psychiatrist Henry A. Tobey took an interest and assisted Dunbar by helping distribute his first book in Toledo and sometimes offering him financial aid. Together, Thatcher and Tobey supported the publication of Dunbar&#x27;s second verse collection, &quot;Majors and Minors&quot; (1896).

Despite frequently publishing poems and occasionally giving public readings, Dunbar had difficulty supporting himself and his mother. Many of his efforts were unpaid and he was a reckless spender, leaving him in debt by the mid-1890s.

On June 27, 1896, the novelist, editor, and critic William Dean Howells published a favorable review of Dunbar&#x27;s second book, &quot;Majors and Minors&quot; in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;. Howells&#x27; influence brought national attention to the poet&#x27;s writing. Though Howell praised the &quot;honest thinking and true feeling&quot; in Dunbar&#x27;s traditional poems, he particularly praised the dialect poems. In this period, there was an appreciation for folk culture, and black dialect was believed to express one type of that. The new literary fame enabled Dunbar to publish his first two books as a collected volume, titled &quot;Lyrics of Lowly Life&quot;, which included an introduction by Howells.

Dunbar maintained a lifelong friendship with the Wright brothers. Through his poetry, he met and became associated with black leaders Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington, and was close to his contemporary James D. Corrothers. Dunbar also became a friend of Brand Whitlock, a journalist in Toledo who went to work in Chicago. Whitlock joined the state government and had a political and diplomatic career.

By the late 1890s, Dunbar started to explore the short story and novel forms; in the latter, he frequently featured white characters and society.

===Later work===

Dunbar was prolific during his relatively short career: he published a dozen books of poetry, four books of short stories, four novels, lyrics for a musical, and a play.

His first collection of short stories, &quot;Folks From Dixie&quot; (1898), a sometimes &quot;harsh examination of racial prejudice&quot;, had favorable reviews.

This was not the case for his first novel, &quot;The Uncalled&quot; (1898), which critics described as &quot;dull and unconvincing&quot;. Dunbar explored the spiritual struggles of a white minister Frederick Brent, who had been abandoned as a child by his alcoholic father and raised by a virtuous white spinster, Hester Prime. (Both the minister and woman&#x27;s names recalled Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s &quot;The Scarlet Letter,&quot; which featured a central character named Hester Prynne.) With this novel, Dunbar has been noted as one of the first African Americans to cross the &quot;color line&quot; by writing a work solely about white society. Critics at the time complained about his handling of the material, not his subject. The novel was not a commercial success.

Dunbar&#x27;s next two novels also explored lives and issues in white culture, and some contemporary critics found these lacking as well. However, literary critic Rebecca Ruth Gould argues that one of these, &quot;The Sport of the Gods&quot;, culminates as an object lesson in the power of shame – a key component of the scapegoat mentality – to limit the law’s capacity to deliver justice.

In collaboration with the composer Will Marion Cook, and Jesse A. Shipp, who wrote the libretto, Dunbar wrote the lyrics for &quot;In Dahomey,&quot; the first musical written and performed entirely by African Americans. It was produced on Broadway in 1903; the musical comedy successfully toured England and the United States over a period of four years and was one of the more successful theatrical productions of its time.

Dunbar&#x27;s essays and poems were published widely in the leading journals of the day, including &quot;Harper&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, the &quot;Denver Post&quot;, &quot;Current Literature&quot; and others. During his life, commentators often noted that Dunbar appeared to be purely black African, at a time when many leading members of the African-American community were notably of mixed race, often with considerable European ancestry.

In 1897 Dunbar traveled to England for a literary tour; he recited his works on the London circuit. He met the young black composer Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, who set some of Dunbar&#x27;s poems to music. Coleridge-Taylor was influenced by Dunbar to use African and American Negro songs and tunes in future compositions. Also living in London at the time, African-American playwright Henry Francis Downing arranged a joint recital for Dunbar and Coleridge-Taylor, under the patronage of John Hay, a former aide to President Abraham Lincoln, and at that time the American ambassador to Great Britain. Downing also lodged Dunbar in London while the poet worked on his first novel, &quot;The Uncalled&quot; (1898).

Dunbar was active in the area of civil rights and the uplifting of African Americans. He was a participant in the March 5, 1897, meeting to celebrate the memory of abolitionist Frederick Douglass. The attendees worked to found the American Negro Academy under Alexander Crummell.

===Marriage and declining health===

After returning from the United Kingdom, Dunbar married Alice Ruth Moore, on March 6, 1898. She was a teacher and poet from New Orleans whom he had met three years earlier. Dunbar called her &quot;the sweetest, smartest little girl I ever saw&quot;. A graduate of Straight University (now Dillard University), a historically black college, Moore is best known for her short story collection, &quot;Violets&quot;. She and her husband also wrote books of poetry as companion pieces. An account of their love, life and marriage was portrayed in &quot;Oak and Ivy,&quot; a 2001 play by Kathleen McGhee-Anderson.

In October 1897 Dunbar took a job at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. He and his wife moved to the capital, where they lived in the comfortable LeDroit Park neighborhood. At the urging of his wife, Dunbar soon left the job to focus on his writing, which he promoted through public readings. While in Washington, DC, Dunbar attended Howard University after the publication of &quot;Lyrics of Lowly Life&quot;.

In 1900, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis, then often fatal, and his doctors recommended drinking whisky to alleviate his symptoms. On the advice of his doctors, he moved to Colorado with his wife, as the cold, dry mountain air was considered favorable for TB patients. Dunbar and his wife separated in 1902, after he nearly beat her to death but they never divorced. Depression and declining health drove him to a dependence on alcohol, which further damaged his health.

Dunbar returned to Dayton in 1904 to be with his mother. He died of tuberculosis on February 9, 1906, at the age of 33. He was interred in the Woodland Cemetery in Dayton.

==Literary style==
Dunbar&#x27;s work is known for its close attention to craft in his formal poetry as well as his dialect poetry. These traits were well matched to the tune-writing ability of Carrie Jacobs-Bond (1862–1946), with whom he collaborated.

===Use of dialect===
Dunbar wrote much of his work in conventional English, while using African-American dialect for some of it, as well as regional dialects. Dunbar felt there was something suspect about the marketability of dialect poems, as if blacks were limited to a constrained form of expression not associated with the educated class. One interviewer reported that Dunbar told him, &quot;I am tired, so tired of dialect&quot;, though he is also quoted as saying, &quot;my natural speech is dialect&quot; and &quot;my love is for the Negro pieces&quot;.

Dunbar credited William Dean Howells with promoting his early success, but was dismayed at the critic&#x27;s encouragement that he concentrate on dialect poetry. Angered that editors refused to print his more traditional poems, Dunbar accused Howells of &quot;[doing] me irrevocable harm in the dictum he laid down regarding my dialect verse.&quot; Dunbar was continuing in a literary tradition that used Negro dialect; his predecessors included such writers as Mark Twain, Joel Chandler Harris and George Washington Cable.

Two brief examples of Dunbar&#x27;s work, the first in standard English and the second in dialect, demonstrate the diversity of the poet&#x27;s works:

(From &quot;Dreams&quot;)

:&quot;What dreams we have and how they fly&quot;
:&quot;Like rosy clouds across the sky;&quot;
:&quot;Of wealth, of fame, of sure success,&quot;
:&quot;Of love that comes to cheer and bless;&quot;
:&quot;And how they wither, how they fade,&quot;
:&quot;The waning wealth, the jilting jade —&quot;
:&quot;The fame that for a moment gleams,&quot;
:&quot;Then flies forever, — dreams, ah — dreams!&quot;

(From &quot;A Warm Day In Winter&quot;)

:&quot;Sunshine on de medders,&quot;
:&quot;Greenness on de way;&quot;
:&quot;Dat&#x27;s de blessed reason&quot;
:&quot;I sing all de day.&quot;
:&quot;Look hyeah! What you axing&#x27;?&quot;
:&quot;What meks me so merry?&quot;
:&quot; &#x27;Spect to see me sighin&quot;&#x27;
:&quot;W&#x27;en hit&#x27;s wa&#x27;m in Febawary?&quot;

==Critical response and legacy==

Dunbar became the first African-American poet to earn national distinction and acceptance. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him &quot;a true singer of the people – white or black.&quot; Frederick Douglass once referred to Dunbar as, &quot;one of the sweetest songsters his race has produced and a man of whom [he hoped] great things.&quot;

His friend and writer James Weldon Johnson highly praised Dunbar, writing in &quot;The Book of American Negro Poetry:&quot;
Paul Laurence Dunbar stands out as the first poet from the Negro race in the United States to show a combined mastery over poetic material and poetic technique, to reveal innate literary distinction in what he wrote, and to maintain a high level of performance. He was the first to rise to a height from which he could take a perspective view of his own race. He was the first to see objectively its humor, its superstitions, its short-comings; the first to feel sympathetically its heart-wounds, its yearnings, its aspirations, and to voice them all in a purely literary form.

This collection was published in 1931, following the Harlem Renaissance, which led to a great outpouring of literary and artistic works by African American people. They explored new topics, expressing ideas about urban life and migration to the North. In his writing, Johnson also criticized Dunbar for his dialect poems, saying they had fostered stereotypes of blacks as comical or pathetic, and reinforced the restriction that blacks write only about scenes of antebellum plantation life in the South.

Dunbar has continued to influence other writers, lyricists, and composers. Composer William Grant Still used excerpts from four dialect poems by Dunbar as epigraphs for the four movements of his Symphony No. 1 in A-flat, &quot;Afro-American&quot; (1930). The next year it was premiered, the first symphony by an African American to be performed by a major orchestra for a US audience. Dunbar&#x27;s vaudeville song &quot;Who Dat Say Chicken in Dis Crowd?&quot; may have influenced the development of &quot;Who dat? Who dat? Who dat say gonna beat dem Saints?&quot;, the popular chant associated with the New Orleans Saints football team, according to Dunbar scholar Hollis Robbins.

Maya Angelou titled her autobiography &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot; (1969) from a line in Dunbar&#x27;s poem &quot;Sympathy&quot;, at the suggestion of jazz musician and activist Abbey Lincoln. Angelou said that Dunbar&#x27;s works had inspired her &quot;writing ambition.&quot; She returns to his symbol of a caged bird as a chained slave in much of her writings.

Dunbar&#x27;s home in Dayton, Ohio, has been preserved as Paul Laurence Dunbar House, a state historical site that is included in the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, administered by the National Park Service.
* His residence in LeDroit Park in Washington, DC, still stands.
* The Dunbar Library of Wright State University holds many of Dunbar&#x27;s papers.
* In 2002, Molefi Kete Asante listed Paul Laurence Dunbar among his 100 Greatest African Americans.

Numerous schools and other places have been named in honor of Dunbar, including Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Lexington, Kentucky, Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Dayton, Ohio, Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in Baltimore, MD, Paul Laurence Dunbar Vocational High School in Chicago, Illinois, and several others. The main library at Wright State University in Dayton and a branch library in Dallas, Texas, are also named for Dunbar, whilst the Dunbar Apartments in Harlem, New York were built by John D. Rockefeller Jr. to provide housing for African Americans. Dunbar Park in Chicago features a statue of Dunbar that was created by sculptor Debra Hand and installed in 2014.

<text>Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1950s in the United States and the United Kingdom. During the 1950s and 1960s, pop music encompassed rock and roll and the youth-oriented styles it influenced. &quot;Rock&quot; and &quot;pop&quot; music remained roughly synonymous until the late 1960s, after which &quot;pop&quot; became associated with music that was more commercial, , and accessible.

Identifying factors of pop music usually include repeated choruses and hooks, short to medium-length songs written in a basic format (often the verse–chorus structure), and rhythms or tempos that can be easily danced to. Much of pop music also borrows elements from other styles such as rock, urban, dance, Latin, and country.

The terms &quot;popular music&quot; and &quot;pop music&quot; are often used interchangeably, although the former more accurately describes &quot;all&quot; music that is targeted for mass appeal (compare art music) and includes many disparate styles. Although much of the music that appears on record charts is considered to be pop music, the genre is distinguished from &quot;chart music&quot;.

==Definitions and etymology==
David Hatch and Stephen Millward describe pop music as &quot;a body of music which is distinguishable from popular, jazz, and folk music&quot;.
David Boyle, a music researcher, states pop music as any type of music that a person has been exposed to by the mass media. Most individuals think that pop music is just the singles charts and not the sum of all chart music. The music charts contain songs from a variety of sources, including classical, jazz, rock, and novelty songs. As a genre, pop music is seen to exist and develop separately. Therefore, the term &quot;pop music&quot; may be used to describe a distinct genre, designed to appeal to all, often characterized as &quot;instant singles-based music aimed at teenagers&quot; in contrast to rock music as &quot;album-based music for adults&quot;.

Pop music evolves along with the term&#x27;s definition. According to music writer Bill Lamb, popular music is defined as &quot;the music since industrialization in the 1800s that is most in line with the tastes and interests of the urban middle class.&quot; The term &quot;pop song&quot; was first used in 1926, in the sense of a piece of music &quot;having popular appeal&quot;. Hatch and Millward indicate that many events in the history of recording in the 1920s can be seen as the birth of the modern pop music industry, including in country, blues, and hillbilly music.

According to the website of &quot;The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;, the term &quot;pop music&quot; &quot;originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced&quot;. &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Music&quot; states that while pop&#x27;s &quot;earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience [...] since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus[ic], usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc.&quot; &quot;Grove Music Online&quot; also states that &quot;[...] in the early 1960s, [the term] &#x27;pop music&#x27; competed terminologically with beat music [in England], while in the US its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of &#x27;rock and roll&#x27;&quot;.

From about 1967, the term &quot;pop music&quot; was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock music, a division that gave generic significance to both terms. While rock aspired to authenticity and an expansion of the possibilities of popular music, pop was more commercial, ephemeral, and accessible. According to British musicologist Simon Frith, pop music is produced &quot;as a matter of enterprise not art&quot;, and is &quot;designed to appeal to everyone&quot; but &quot;doesn&#x27;t come from any particular place or mark off any particular taste&quot;. Frith adds that it is &quot;not driven by any significant ambition except profit and commercial reward [...] and, in musical terms, it is essentially conservative&quot;. It is, &quot;provided from on high (by record companies, radio programmers, and concert promoters) rather than being made from below (...) Pop is not a do-it-yourself music but is professionally produced and packaged&quot;. 

==Characteristics==
According to Frith, characteristics of pop music include an aim of appealing to a general audience, rather than to a particular sub-culture or ideology, and an emphasis on craftsmanship rather than formal &quot;artistic&quot; qualities. Besides, Frith also offers three identifying characteristics of pop music: light entertainment, commercial imperatives, and personal identification. Pop music grew out of a light entertainment and easy listening tradition. Pop music is more conservative than other music genres such as folk, blues, country, and tradition. Many pop songs do not contain themes of resistance, opposition, or politics, rather focusing more on love and relationships. Therefore, pop music does not challenge its audiences socially, and does not cause political activism. Frith also said the main purpose of pop music is to create revenue. It is not a medium of free articulation of the people. Instead, pop music seeks to achieve the instant empathy with cliche personalities, stereotypes, and melodrama that appeals to listeners. Music scholar Timothy Warner said pop music typically has an emphasis on recording, production, and technology, rather than live performance; a tendency to reflect existing trends rather than progressive developments; and seeks to encourage dancing or uses dance-oriented rhythms.

The main medium of pop music is the song, often between two and a half and three and a half minutes in length, generally marked by a consistent and noticeable rhythmic element, a mainstream style and a simple traditional structure. The structure of many popular songs is that of a verse and a chorus, the chorus serving as the portion of the track that is designed to stick in the ear through simple repetition both musically and lyrically. The chorus is often where the music builds towards and is often preceded by &quot;the drop&quot; where the bass and drum parts &quot;drop out&quot;. Common variants include the verse-chorus form and the thirty-two-bar form, with a focus on melodies and catchy hooks, and a chorus that contrasts melodically, rhythmically and harmonically with the verse. The beat and the melodies tend to be simple, with limited harmonic accompaniment. The lyrics of modern pop songs typically focus on simple themes – often love and romantic relationships – although there are notable exceptions.

Harmony and chord progressions in pop music are often &quot;that of classical European tonality, only more simple-minded.&quot; Clichés include the barbershop quartet-style harmony (i.e. ii – V – I) and blues scale-influenced harmony. There was a lessening of the influence of traditional views of the circle of fifths between the mid-1950s and the late 1970s, including less predominance for the dominant function.

In October 2023, &quot;Billboard&quot; compiled a list of &quot;the 500 best pop songs&quot;. In doing so, they noted the difficulty of defining &quot;pop songs&quot;:
==Development and influence==
===Technology and media===

In the 1940s, improved microphone design allowed a more intimate singing style and, ten or twenty years later, inexpensive and more durable 45 rpm records for singles &quot;revolutionized the manner in which pop has been disseminated&quot;, which helped to move pop music to &quot;a record/radio/film star system&quot;. Another technological change was the widespread availability of television in the 1950s with televised performances, which meant that &quot;pop stars had to have a visual presence&quot;. In the 1960s, the introduction of inexpensive, portable transistor radios meant that teenagers in the developed world could listen to music outside of the home. By the early 1980s, the promotion of pop music had been greatly affected by the rise of music television channels like MTV, which &quot;favoured those artists such as Michael Jackson and Madonna who had a strong visual appeal&quot;.

Multi-track recording (from the 1960s) and digital sampling (from the 1980s) have also been used as methods for the creation and elaboration of pop music. During the mid-1960s, pop music made repeated forays into new sounds, styles, and techniques that inspired public discourse among its listeners. The word &quot;progressive&quot; was frequently used, and it was thought that every song and single was to be a &quot;progression&quot; from the last. Music critic Simon Reynolds writes that beginning with 1967, a divide would exist between &quot;progressive&quot; pop and &quot;mass/chart&quot; pop, a separation which was &quot;also, broadly, one between boys and girls, middle-class and working-class.&quot;

The latter half of the 20th century included a large-scale trend in American culture in which the boundaries between art and pop music were increasingly blurred. Between 1950 and 1970, there was a debate of pop versus art. Since then, certain music publications have embraced the music&#x27;s legitimacy, a trend referred to as &quot;poptimism&quot;.

===Stylistic evolution===
Throughout its development, pop music has absorbed influences from other genres of popular music. Early pop music drew on traditional pop, an American counterpart to German Schlager and French Chanson, however compared to the pop of European countries, traditional pop originally emphasized influences ranging from Tin Pan Alley songwriting, Broadway theatre, and show tunes. As the genre evolved more influences ranging from classical, folk, rock, country, electronic music, and other popular genres became more prominent. In 2016, a &quot;Scientific Reports&quot; study that examined over 464,000 recordings of popular music recorded between 1955 and 2010 found that, compared to 1960s pop music, contemporary pop music uses a smaller variety of pitch progressions, greater average volume, less diverse instrumentation and recording techniques, and less timbral variety. &quot;Scientific American&quot;″s John Matson reported that this &quot;seems to support the popular anecdotal observation that pop music of yore was &quot;better&quot;, or at least more varied, than today&#x27;s top-40 stuff&quot;. However, he also noted that the study may not have been entirely representative of pop in each generation.

In the 1960s, the majority of mainstream pop music fell in two categories: guitar, drum and bass groups or singers backed by a traditional orchestra. Since early in the decade, it was common for pop producers, songwriters, and engineers to freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects. Some of the best known examples are Phil Spector&#x27;s Wall of Sound and Joe Meek&#x27;s use of homemade electronic sound effects for acts like the Tornados. At the same time, pop music on radio and in both American and British film moved away from refined Tin Pan Alley to more eccentric songwriting and incorporated reverb-drenched electric guitar, symphonic strings, and horns played by groups of properly arranged and rehearsed studio musicians. A 2019 study held by New York University in which 643 participants had to rank how familiar a pop song is to them, songs from the 1960s turned out to be the most memorable, significantly more than songs from recent years 2000 to 2015.

Before the progressive pop of the late 1960s, performers were typically unable to decide on the artistic content of their music. Assisted by the mid-1960s economic boom, record labels began investing in artists, giving them the freedom to experiment, and offering them limited control over their content and marketing. This situation declined after the late 1970s and would not reemerge until the rise of Internet stars. Indie pop, which developed in the late 1970s, marked another departure from the glamour of contemporary pop music, with guitar bands formed on the then-novel premise that one could record and release their own music without having to procure a record contract from a major label.

The 1980s are commonly remembered for an increase in the use of digital recording, associated with the usage of synthesizers, with synth-pop music and other electronic genres featuring non-traditional instruments increasing in popularity. By 2014, pop music worldwide had been permeated by electronic dance music. In 2018, researchers at the University of California, Irvine, concluded that pop music has become &#x27;sadder&#x27; since the 1980s. The elements of happiness and brightness have eventually been replaced with electronic beats making pop music more &#x27;sad yet danceable&#x27;.

===International spread and crosspollination===

Pop music has been dominated by the American and (from the mid-1960s) British music industries, whose influence has made pop music something of an international monoculture, but most regions and countries have their own form of pop music, sometimes producing local versions of wider trends, and lending them local characteristics. Some of these trends (for example Europop) have had a significant impact on the development of the genre.

According to &quot;Grove Music Online&quot;, &quot;Western-derived pop styles, whether coexisting with or marginalizing distinctively local genres, have spread throughout the world and have come to constitute stylistic common denominators in global commercial music cultures&quot;. Some non-Western countries, such as Japan, have developed a thriving pop music industry, most of which is devoted to Western-style pop. Japan has for several years produced a greater quantity of music than everywhere except the US. The spread of Western-style pop music has been interpreted variously as representing processes of Americanization, homogenization, modernization, creative appropriation, cultural imperialism, or a more general process of globalization.

One of the pop music styles that developed alongside other music styles is Latin pop, which rose in popularity in the US during the 1950s with early rock and roll success Ritchie Valens. Later, Los Lobos and Chicano rock gained in popularity during the 1970s and 1980s, and musician Selena saw large-scale popularity in the 1980s and 1990s, along with crossover appeal with fans of Tejano musicians Lydia Mendoza and Little Joe. With later Hispanic and Latino Americans seeing success within pop music charts, 1990s pop successes stayed popular in both their original genres and in broader pop music. Latin pop hit singles, such as &quot;Macarena&quot; by Los del Río and &quot;Despacito&quot; by Luis Fonsi, have seen record-breaking success on worldwide pop music charts.

Notable pop artists of the late 20th century that became global superstars include Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Madonna, George Michael, and Prince.

=== 21st century ===

At the beginning of the 2000s, the trends that dominated during the late 1990s still continued, but the music industry started to change as people began to download music from the internet. People were able to discover genres and artists that were outside of the mainstream and propel them to fame, but at the same time smaller artists had a harder time making a living because their music was being pirated. Popular artists were Avril Lavigne, Justin Timberlake, NSYNC, Christina Aguilera, Destiny&#x27;s Child, and Britney Spears. Pop music often came from many different genres, with each genre in turn influencing the next one, blurring the lines between them and making them less distinct. This change was epitomized in Spears&#x27; highly influential 2007 album &quot;Blackout&quot;, which under the influence of producer Danja, mixed the sounds of EDM, avant-funk, R&amp;B, dance music, and hip hop.

By 2010, pop music impacted by dance music came to be dominant on the charts. Instead of radio setting the trends, it was now the club. At the beginning of the 2010s, Will.i.am stated, &quot;The new bubble is all the collective clubs around the world. Radio is just doing its best to keep up.&quot; Songs that talked of escapism through partying became the most popular, influenced by the impulse to forget the economic troubles that had taken over the world after the 2008 crash, this style of pop music is now known as recession pop. Throughout the 2010s, a lot of pop music also began to take cues from alternative pop. Popularized by artists such as Lana Del Rey and Lorde in the early 2010s and later inspiring other highly influential artists including Billie Eilish and Taylor Swift, it gave space to a more sad and moody tone within pop music.

Paul&#x27;s latest CD is entitled &quot;Paul Wertico&#x27;s Drums Without Boundaries&quot; and it received a four-star rating in &quot;DownBeat&quot;.

==Critical reception==
Wertico&#x27;s debut CD as a leader, &quot;The Yin And The Yout&quot;, received a four-star rating in &quot;DownBeat&quot;. His 1998 trio CD, &quot;Live In Warsaw!&quot;, received four and a half stars from &quot;DownBeat&quot; and featured guitarist John Moulder and bassist Eric Hochberg. The trio&#x27;s 2000 studio recording, entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Scared Anymore&quot;, received reviews of &quot;This album is like the soundtrack to the world&#x27;s coolest vacation&quot; from &quot;All About Jazz&quot; and &quot;Jazz-rock in the truest sense&quot; from &quot;AllMusic&quot;.

Wertico&#x27;s 2004 CD, &quot;StereoNucleosis&quot;, was released to extremely positive reviews. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;A brilliant release – Wertico shows a thrilling disregard for stylistic boundaries. &quot;StereoNucleosis&quot; is one of the most intelligent, creative and alluring percussion recordings of the past decade. Wertico reaffirms his position among the most restlessly inventive drummers working today.&quot; &quot;Allmusic&quot; reported: &quot;Wertico and his players have done something wonderful and rare: they&#x27;ve actually created something not only different, but also truly new.&quot; &quot;LA Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;His recent records, such as 2000&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Scared Anymore&quot; and the new &quot;StereoNucleosis&quot; are stunning examples of the electronic, rhythmic and intellectual directions jazz could be going.&quot; Wertico&#x27;s 2006 CD, &quot;Another Side&quot;, was released on the audiophile Naim Label; it was described as &quot;a brilliant collaborative effort between these three uniquely talented musicians.&quot;

His 2010 CD, &quot;Impressions Of A City&quot;, featuring his band, Paul Wertico&#x27;s Mid-East/Mid-West Alliance, has been described in reviews as &quot;One of the most impressively spontaneous albums you&#x27;ll find on this planet – or any other&quot;; &quot;Haunting and memorable…an engaging musical experiment and one that is highly unique.&quot;; &quot;This is musical narrative at its finest. A fanfare for the common (and mechanically exploited) 21st century man and woman.&quot;; &quot;Sometimes beautiful, other times tense or just plain spooky, &quot;Impressions of a City&quot; ought to go some way toward correcting the dubious reputation of avant-garde music.&quot;; &quot;A wildly unpredictable journey into one man&#x27;s apparently inexhaustible sonic imagination.&quot;

&quot;DownBeat&quot; magazine awarded it four and a half stars, listed it as of the Best CDs of 2010, and wrote &quot;What makes the music work is not only that Wertico is not content to just &quot;play it straight&quot; as a drummer but that his skills as a conceptualist/leader may even be greater. A heads-up for all budding drummers (check out Wertico&#x27;s inventive pause of a solo on &quot;My Side of the Story&quot;) who would like to hear and create music that goes beyond just keeping time.&quot;

This band also released a live in concert DVD, entitled &quot;Live From SPACE&quot;, that has been reviewed by the &quot;Chicago Examiner&quot; as &quot;More than setting tones, moods, and the stage for future, like-minded experimentation, these talented musicians have managed to also push the limits of what jazz can be, while entertaining a wider form of audience.&quot;; and thiszine.org wrote &quot;For Wertico fans, this DVD is a must have, showcasing innovative, finely tuned jazz talent. For new fans of modern jazz, this would be a staple, and a great place to start before your journey backwards.&quot;

In 2007 Wertico and Brian Peters released their CD, &quot;Ampersand&quot;, which Drummerszone.com called &quot;Simply a musical masterpiece&quot; and &quot;Classic Drummer&quot; described as &quot;one of the most ambitious records ever released. Recorded over a period of four years, it documents a completely new approach to combine elements of both rock and jazz music while resulting in a very listenable and captivating final product.&quot; That same year he released &quot;Jazz Impressions 1&quot; with pianist Silvano Monasterios and bassist Mark Egan. &quot;Chicago Jazz&quot; wrote: &quot;From the first note of &quot;Jazz Impressions 1&quot;, you know you&#x27;re in for something interesting and different. What these three do with that format, however, is nothing short of breathtaking.&quot;

<text>The Porsche 356 is a rear-engine sports car, and the first ever production Porsche model.

The 356 is a lightweight and nimble-handling, rear-engine, rear-wheel drive, two-door available both in hardtop coupé and open configurations. Engineering innovations continued during the years of manufacture, contributing to its motorsports success and popularity. Production started in 1948 at Gmünd, Austria, where Porsche built approximately 50 cars. In 1950 the factory relocated to Zuffenhausen, Germany, and general production of the 356 continued until April 1965, well after the replacement model 911 made its September 1964 debut. Of the 76,000 originally produced, approximately half survive. It was first produced by Austrian company Porsche Konstruktionen GesmbH (1948–1949), and then by German company Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche GmbH (1950–1965). It was Porsche&#x27;s first production automobile. Earlier cars designed by the Austrian company include Cisitalia Grand Prix race car, the Volkswagen Beetle, and Auto Union Grand Prix cars.

The original price in 1948 for the 356 coupe was (official general USD inflation). The 356 cabriolet cost .

==History==
In 1948, the mid-engine, tubular chassis prototype Porsche 356/1 was completed. Although the prototype had a rear-mid engine placement, the production rear-engined 356 is considered by Porsche to be its first car.

The 356 was created by Ferdinand &quot;Ferry&quot; Porsche (son of Ferdinand Porsche, founder of the German company), who founded the Austrian company with his sister, Louise. Like its cousin, the Volkswagen Beetle (which Ferdinand Porsche Sr. had designed), the 356 is a four-cylinder, air-cooled, rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive car with unitized pan and body construction. The chassis was a completely new design, as was the 356&#x27;s body, designed by Porsche employee Erwin Komenda. At the same time, certain mechanical components, including the engine case and some suspension components, were based on and initially sourced from Volkswagen. Ferry Porsche described the thinking behind the development of the 356 in an interview with the editor of &quot;Panorama&quot;, the PCA magazine, in September 1972. &quot;...I had always driven very speedy cars. I had an Alfa Romeo, also a BMW, and others. ….By the end of the war, I had a Volkswagen Cabriolet with a supercharged engine, and that was the basic idea. I saw that if you had enough power in a small car, it is nicer to drive than if you have a big car which is also overpowered. And it is more fun. On this basic idea, we started the first Porsche prototype. To make the car lighter, to have an engine with more horsepower…that was the first two-seater that we built in Carinthia (Gmünd)&quot;.

The first 356 was road certified in Austria on June 8, 1948, and was entered in a race in Innsbruck, where it won its class. Porsche re-engineered and refined the car with a focus on performance. Volkswagen and Porsche shared fewer parts as the 1950s progressed. Porsche handcrafted the early 356 automobile bodies at Gmünd in aluminum, but when production moved to Zuffenhausen, Germany, in 1950, models produced there were steel-bodied. The aluminum-bodied cars from that very small company are what are now referred to as &quot;prototypes&quot;. Porsche contracted Reutter to build the steel bodies and eventually bought the Reutter company in 1963. The Reutter company retained the seat manufacturing part of the business and changed its name to &quot;Recaro&quot;.

Little noticed at its inception, mostly by a small number of auto racing enthusiasts, the first 356s sold primarily in Austria and Germany. It took Porsche two years, starting with the first prototype in 1948, to manufacture the first 50 automobiles. By the early 1950s the 356 had gained some renown among enthusiasts on both sides of the Atlantic for its aerodynamics, handling, and excellent build quality. The class win at Le Mans in 1951 was a factor. It was common for owners to race the car as well as drive them on the streets. They introduced the four-cam racing &quot;Carrera&quot; engine, a totally new design and unique to Porsche sports cars, in late 1954. Increasing success with its racing and road cars brought Porsche orders for over 10,000 units in 1964, and by the time 356 production ended in 1965 approximately 76,000 had been produced.

The 356 was built in four distinct series, the original (&quot;pre-A&quot;), followed by the 356 A, 356 B, and finally the 356 C. To distinguish among the major revisions of the model, 356s are generally classified into a few major groups. The 356 coupés and &quot;cabriolets&quot; (soft-tops) built through 1955 are readily identifiable by their split (1948 to 1952) or bent (centre-creased, 1953 to 1955) windscreens. In late 1955 the 356 A appeared, with a curved windshield. The A was the first road going Porsche to offer the Carrera four-cam engine as an option. In late 1959 the T5 356 B appeared; followed by the redesigned T6 series 356 B in 1962. The final version was the 356 C, little changed from the late T6 B cars but disc brakes replaced the drums.

Prior to the completion of 356 production, Porsche had developed a higher-revving 616/36 version of the 356&#x27;s four-cylinder pushrod engine for installation in a new 912 model that commenced production in April 1965. Although the 912 used numerous 356 components, Porsche did not intend for the 912 to replace the 356.

When the decision was made to replace the 356, the 901 (later 911) was the road car designed to carry the Porsche name forward. The 912 was developed as the &quot;standard version&quot; of the 911 at the price of a 356 1600 SC, while the complex but faster and heavier six-cylinder 911 was priced more than fifty percent higher. Customers purchased nearly 33,000 912 coupés and Targas powered by the Type 616 engine that had served Porsche so well during the 356 era.

==Models==
===356 &quot;pre-A&quot;===

From the earliest, 1,100 cc Gmünd beginnings, the overall shape of the 356 remained more or less set. In 1951, 1,300 and 1,500 cc engines with considerably more power were introduced. In April 1952 the split windscreen was replaced by a slightly V-shaped, single windshield, which fit into the same shape opening. In 1953, the 1300 S or &quot;Super&quot; was introduced, and the 1,100 cc engine was dropped. 

In late 1954, Max Hoffman, the sole US importer of Porsches, convinced Porsche to build a stripped down roadster version with minimal equipment and a cut-down windscreen.

Towards the end of the original 356&#x27;s time (in 1955, when the 356 A was about to be introduced), Hoffman, wanting a model name rather than just a number, got the factory to use the name &quot;Continental&quot; which was applied mostly to cars sold in the United States. Ford, makers of the Lincoln Continental, sued. This name was used only in 1955 and today this version is especially valued. For 1956, the equivalent version was briefly sold as the &quot;European&quot;. Today, all of the earliest Porsches are highly coveted by collectors and enthusiasts worldwide, based on their design, reliability and sporting performance.

The M422 Mighty Mite, a military light utility vehicle built for the United States Marine Corps, originally used the engine from the 1300 S, but the production M422 had to use a different engine due to regulations requiring US-built equipment in US military vehicles.

===356 A===
In late 1955, with numerous small but significant changes, the 356 A was introduced. Its internal factory designation, &quot;Type 1&quot;, gave rise to its nickname &quot;T1&quot; among enthusiasts. In the US, 1,200 early 356s had been badged as the &quot;Continental&quot; and then a further 156 from autumn 1955 to January 1956 as an even rarer T1 &quot;European&quot; variant after which it reverted to its numerical 356 designation. In early 1957 a second revision of the 356 A was produced, known as Type 2 (or T2). Production of the Speedster peaked at 1,171 cars in 1957 and then started to decline. The four-cam &quot;Carrera&quot; engine, initially available only in the spyder race cars, became an available option starting with the 356 A.

Within the last 25 years, replicas of the 356 A have become very popular.

The most typical engine was a 4-cylinder boxer, which was air-cooled, naturally aspirated with dual downdraft Zenith carburetors, had a 2 valve per cylinder OHV valvetrain, and produced at 4,500 rpm and a maximum torque of at 2,800 rpm.


===356 B===

In late 1959, significant styling and technical refinements gave rise to the 356 B (a T5 body type). The mid-1962 356 B model was changed to the T6 body type (twin grilles on the engine compartment cover, an external fuel filler in the right front wing/fender and a larger rear window in the coupé). Porsche did not draw attention to these (quite visible) changes, initially keeping the same model designation. However, when the T6 got disc brakes, with no other visible alterations, they called it the model C, or the SC when it had the optional, more powerful engine. A unique &quot;Karmann hardtop&quot; or &quot;notchback&quot; 356 B model was produced in 1961 and 1962. The 1961 production run (T5) was essentially a cabriolet body with the optional steel cabriolet hardtop welded in place. The 1962 line (T6 production) was a very different design in that the new T6 notchback coupé body did not start life as a cabriolet, but with its own production design. In essence, it had the cabriolet rear end design, the T6 coupé windshield frame and a unique hard top. Both years of these models have taken the name &quot;Karmann notchback&quot;.

===356 C===
The last revision of the 356 was the 356 C introduced for the 1964 model year. It featured disc brakes all around, radial Pirelli Cinturato tyres, as well as an option for the most powerful pushrod engine Porsche had ever produced, the &quot;SC&quot;. Production of the 356 peaked at 14,151 cars in 1964, the year that its successor, the new Porsche 911, was introduced to the US market (it was introduced slightly earlier in Europe). The company continued to sell the 356 C in North America through 1965 as demand for the model remained quite strong in the early days of the heavier and more &quot;civilized&quot; 911.

The last ten 356s (cabriolets) were assembled for the Dutch Rijkspolitie, the highway patrolling predecessor of the Netherlands police force, in March 1966 as 1965 models. Using Porsches to control traffic and speeders was so successful on Holland&#x27;s express-ways, that the Dutch national police branch kept using Porsche 911s into the watercooled era that began in 1998.

=== 530 ===
In 1953, Studebaker contacted Porsche to develop a new engine, but they developed an entire car that was a four-seat version of the 356. The prototype called Porsche 530 was rejected as Studebaker wanted a larger car, with larger engine and with the engine in the front. The new prototype was called Porsche 542 or Studebaker Z-87.

==Body styles==
The 356 originated as a coupé only 1948–1955. Over time a variety of other styles appeared, including roadster, convertible, cabriolet, and a very rare split-roof.

The basic design of the 356 remained the same until production ended in 1965, with evolutionary, functional improvements rather than annual superficial styling changes.

The car used unibody construction, making restoration difficult for cars that were kept in rust-prone climates. Cabriolet models (convertibles with a full windshield and padded top) were offered from the start, and in the early 1950s sometimes comprised over 50% of total production. 

One of the most desirable collector models is the 356 &quot;Speedster&quot;, introduced in late 1954 after Max Hoffman advised the company that a lower-cost, somewhat spartan open-top version could sell well in the American market. With its low, raked windscreen (which could be removed for weekend racing), bucket seats and minimal folding top, the Speedster was an instant hit, especially in Southern California. A total of 4854 speedsters were built (all years combined). It was replaced in late 1958 by the &quot;convertible D&quot; model. It featured a taller, more practical windshield (allowing improved headroom with the top erected), roll-up glass side-windows and more comfortable seats. The following year the 356 B &quot;roadster&quot; convertible replaced the D model but the sports car market&#x27;s love affair with top-down motoring was fading; soft-top 356 model sales declined significantly in the early 1960s.

A unique &quot;Karmann hardtop&quot; or &quot;notchback&quot; 356 B model was produced in 1961 and 1962, essentially a cabriolet-style body with a permanent metal roof.

==Engine==
Porsche designers designed the 356&#x27;s air-cooled pushrod OHV flat-four around the engine case originally designed for the Volkswagen Beetle, adding new cylinder heads, camshaft, crankshaft, intake and exhaust manifolds and dual carburetors, making – more than double the Beetle&#x27;s horsepower. While the first prototype 356 had a mid-engine layout, all subsequent 356 engines were rear-mounted. The four-cam &quot;Carrera&quot; engine appeared in late 1955 as an extra cost option on the 356 A, and remained available through the 356 model run.

==Legacy==
The 356 has always been popular with the motor press. In 2004, &quot;Sports Car International&quot; ranked the 356 C tenth on their list of top sports cars of the 1960s. It remains a highly regarded collector car, regularly bringing between US$20,000 and well over US$100,000 at auction. The limited production Carrera Speedster (with its special DOHC racing engine), SC, Super 90 and Speedster models are among the most desirable. Multiple restored Carrera variants (of which only about 140 were made) have sold for values in excess of US$800,000, with the vast majority sold for more than US$300,000 at auction. , the most expensive 356 to sell was the daily driver of rocker Janis Joplin that was sold in New York by RM Sotheby&#x27;s for $1,760,000 (£1,163,630) in 2015.

==Motorsport==
The Porsche 356, close to stock or highly modified, has enjoyed much success in rallying and car racing events.

At the 1951 Le Mans 24 Hours, Porsche was the first and only German manufacturer to compete. Porsche fielded the 356 SL (, super light) &quot;Gmünd-Coupe&quot; with its streamlined aluminum body and covered wheels. The debut was a huge success: Auguste Veuillet and his friend Edmond Mouche won the class 751 to 1100 cc and received the flag as 20th overall. 

Several Porsche 356s were stripped down in weight, and were modified in order to have better performance and handling for these races. A few notable examples include the Porsche 356 SL, and the Porsche 356 A Carrera GT.

In the early 1960s Porsche collaborated with Abarth and built the Porsche 356 B Carrera GTL Abarth coupé, which enjoyed some success in motorsports.

==First Carrera car==
Number 53456, the first 356 Carrera ever produced (a modified May 3, 1955 exemplar owned by Porsche engineer Reinhard Schmidt as first owner), was analyzed in February 2018 by &quot;Quattroruote&quot;&#x27;s subsidiary &quot;Ruoteclassiche&quot;. It was estimated that its price was about .

<text>A phospholipase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes phospholipids into fatty acids and other lipophilic substances. There are four major classes, termed A, B, C, and D, which are distinguished by the type of reaction which they catalyze:

*Phospholipase A
**Phospholipase A1 – cleaves the &quot;sn&quot;-1 acyl chain (where &quot;sn&quot; refers to stereospecific numbering).
**Phospholipase A2 – cleaves the &quot;sn&quot;-2 acyl chain, releasing arachidonic acid.
*Phospholipase B – cleaves both &quot;sn&quot;-1 and &quot;sn&quot;-2 acyl chains; this enzyme is also known as a lysophospholipase.
*Phospholipase C – cleaves before the phosphate, releasing diacylglycerol and a phosphate-containing head group. PLCs play a central role in signal transduction, releasing the second messenger inositol triphosphate.
*Phospholipase D – cleaves after the phosphate, releasing phosphatidic acid and an alcohol.

Types C and D are considered phosphodiesterases.

Endothelial lipase is primarily a phospholipase.

Phospholipase A2 acts on the intact lecithin molecule and hydrolyzes the fatty acid esterified to the second carbon atom. The resulting products are lysolecithin and a fatty acid. Phospholipase A2 is an enzyme present in the venom of bees, blennies and viper snakes.

<doc id="24630" wikidata="Q726918" url="?curid=24630" title="Pedro Martínez">
<text>Pedro Jaime Martínez (born October 25, 1971) is a Dominican-American former professional baseball starting pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from to , for five teams—most notably the Boston Red Sox from to .

As of 2023, Martínez&#x27;s record of 219 wins and 100 losses places him tenth-highest in winning percentage in major league history and fifth-highest among pitchers with more than 2,000 career innings pitched. Martínez ended his career with an earned run average (ERA) of 2.93, among the lowest ever by a pitcher with at least 2,500 innings pitched since 1920. He reached the 3,000 strikeout mark in fewer innings than any pitcher except Randy Johnson and Max Scherzer; Martínez is the only pitcher other than Scherzer to compile over 3,000 career strikeouts with fewer than 3,000 innings pitched in his career. As of 2023, Martínez&#x27;s career strikeout rate of 10.04 per nine innings ranks sixth all-time among pitchers with over 1,500 innings.

An eight-time All-Star, Martínez was at his peak from to , establishing himself as one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball history. He won three Cy Young Awards (1997, 1999, 2000) and was runner-up twice (1998, 2002), posting a cumulative record of 118–36 (.766) with a 2.20 ERA, while leading his league in ERA five times and in winning percentage and strikeouts three times each. In , Martínez was runner-up for the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player Award, after winning the pitching Triple Crown with a 23–4 record, 2.07 ERA, and 313 strikeouts, and—along with Johnson—joined Gaylord Perry in the rare feat of winning the Cy Young Award in both the American and National Leagues (a feat since accomplished by Roger Clemens, Roy Halladay, Max Scherzer, and Blake Snell). He recorded the second-lowest single-season Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP) in the live ball era (1.39 in 1999), the second-lowest single-season WHIP total in major league history (0.737 in ), and the lowest single-season Adjusted ERA+ in major league history (291, also in 2000). Although his performance suffered a steep decline in 2004, Martínez ended the season memorably by helping the Red Sox end a long drought in winning their first World Series title in 86 years.

Officially listed at and , Martínez was unusually small for a modern-day power pitcher, and is believed to have been somewhat smaller than his officially listed height and weight. In his early 30s, injuries began to keep him off the field to an increasing extent, with his appearances and success dropping off sharply in his final seasons. Modern sabermetric analysis has strongly highlighted Martínez&#x27;s achievements. As of 2023, his career strikeout-to-walk ratio, WHIP, and adjusted ERA+ are among the highest in major league history. Martínez dominated while pitching most often in a hitter-friendly ballpark and facing some of the toughest competition during the steroid era, which is generally thought to have favored batters. Many consider Martínez to be one of the greatest pitchers in major league history. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015 in his first year of eligibility, joining Juan Marichal as the second Dominican to be enshrined; his number (45) was retired by the Red Sox in a ceremony held two days after his Hall induction.

==Early life==
Martínez grew up in the Dominican Republic in the Santo Domingo suburb of Manoguayabo. He was the fifth of six siblings living in a palm wood house with a tin roof and dirt floors. His father, Pablo Jaime Abreu, worked odd jobs. His mother, Leopoldina Martínez, worked for traditionally wealthy families, washing their clothes. When Martínez was old enough to work, he held a job as a mechanic.

He did not have enough money to afford baseballs, so he improvised with oranges. His older brother, Ramón Martínez, was pitching at a Los Angeles Dodgers baseball camp in the Dominican Republic. As a young teenager, Martínez carried his brother&#x27;s bags at the camp. One day at the camp, Ramón Martínez clocked his 14-year-old brother&#x27;s pitches at between 78 and 80 miles per hour.

Martínez debuted professionally with the Tigres del Licey of the Dominican Winter League during the 1989–90 season. He then pitched briefly for the Azucareros del Este, before rejoining Licey in 1991–92 in a nine-player transaction that included George Bell, José Offerman and Julio Solano, among others.

==Career==

===Los Angeles Dodgers===
Martínez was originally signed by the Dodgers as an amateur free agent in 1988. In his first season in the minors he was assigned to the Great Falls Dodgers where he worked with coach Guy Conti to develop a circle changeup which Conti had learned from Johnny Podres. Conti also worked with the young pitcher on his English and helped him assimilate to the United States; Martínez later described Conti as his &quot;white daddy.&quot; As a minor leaguer in the Dodgers farm system, he was a highly touted prospect although some talent evaluators took issue with his &quot;poise&quot; despite his having a &quot;great fastball and circle-changeup.&quot; He made his MLB debut on September 24, 1992, for the Dodgers against the Cincinnati Reds, working two scoreless innings of relief. He made his first start for the Dodgers on September 30, taking the loss while giving up two runs in a 3–1 loss to the Reds.

Although Martínez&#x27;s brother Ramón, then a star pitcher for the Dodgers, declared that his brother was an even better pitcher than he, the younger Martínez was thought by manager Tommy Lasorda too small to be an effective starting pitcher at the MLB level; Lasorda used Pedro Martínez almost exclusively as a relief pitcher. Lasorda was not the first to question Martínez&#x27;s stature and durability; in the minor leagues, the then-135-pound pitcher was threatened with a $500 fine if he was caught running. Martínez turned in a strong 1993 season as the Dodgers&#x27; setup man, going 10–5 with a 2.61 ERA and 119 strikeouts, in 65 games; his 107 innings led all NL relievers. With the Dodgers in need of a second baseman after a contract dispute with Jody Reed, Martínez was traded to the Montreal Expos for Delino DeShields before the 1994 season.

===Montreal Expos===
It was with the Expos that Martínez developed into one of the top pitchers in baseball. Despite possessing a live fastball, he had difficulty maintaining control. It was during a bullpen session that manager Felipe Alou encouraged him to modify his primary grip on the fastball from two-seam to four-seam. The transformation was dramatic: the fastball − already among the fastest in the game − now was thrown with near-impeccable control and break that routinely overwhelmed hitters. On April 13, 1994, Martínez took a perfect game through innings until throwing a brushback pitch at Reggie Sanders that led Sanders to immediately charge the mound, starting a bench-clearing brawl. Martínez ended up with a no-decision in the game, which the Expos eventually won 3–2.

On June 3, 1995, Martínez pitched nine perfect innings in a game against the San Diego Padres, before giving up a hit in the bottom of the 10th inning. He was immediately removed from the game, and was the winning pitcher in Montreal&#x27;s 1–0 victory. [See &quot;Memorable Games&quot;]

In 1996, during a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, Mike Williams attempted to hit Martínez with retaliatory pitches for an earlier hit batter but failed with two consecutive attempts. After the second attempt, Martínez charged the mound, and started a bench-clearing fight.

In 1997, Martínez posted a 17–8 record for the Expos, and led the league in half a dozen pitching categories, including a 1.90 ERA, 305 strikeouts and 13 complete games pitched, while becoming the only Expo ever to win the National League Cy Young Award. The 13 complete games were tied for the second-highest single-season total in the modern era of baseball since Martínez&#x27;s career began (Curt Schilling had 15 in 1998; Chuck Finley and Jack McDowell also reached 13 in a year). However, this 1997 total is by far the highest in Martínez&#x27;s career, as he only completed more than five games in one other season (seven, in 2000). Martínez was the first right-handed pitcher to reach 300 strikeouts with an ERA under 2.00 since Walter Johnson in 1912.

===Boston Red Sox===
Approaching free agency, Martínez was traded to the Boston Red Sox in November 1997 for Carl Pavano and Tony Armas Jr. Martínez was subsequently signed to a six-year, $75 million contract (with an option for a seventh year at $17 million) by Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette, at the time the largest ever awarded to a pitcher. Martínez paid immediate dividends in 1998, compiling a 19–7 record and finishing second in the American League in ERA, WHIP, strikeouts, and Cy Young Award voting.

In 1999, Martínez finished 23–4 with a 2.07 ERA and 313 strikeouts (earning the Pitching Triple Crown) in innings across 31 games (29 starts). He led the entire major leagues with strikeouts per nine innings and strikeout-to-walk ratios of 13.20 and 8.46, respectively. His Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP) (a defense independent pitching statistic measuring a pitcher&#x27;s effectiveness at limiting walks, home runs, and hits while accumulating strikeouts) of 1.39 was the lowest single-season total in the major leagues since 1910 among pitchers who threw more than 35 innings. The second best FIP in baseball in 1999 was Randy Johnson&#x27;s 2.76, and that year, no one else in the American League had a FIP below 3.25. Martínez also became just the ninth modern pitcher to record a second 300-strikeout season, along with Randy Johnson (6 times), Nolan Ryan (6 times), Sandy Koufax (3 times), Curt Schilling (3 times), Walter Johnson, Sam McDowell, J. R. Richard, and Rube Waddell. An anomaly among power pitchers, Martínez is the only 20th-century pitcher to notch 300 strikeouts in a season without being at least six feet tall.

Martínez unanimously won his second Cy Young Award and finished second in the AL Most Valuable Player (MVP) ballot. The MVP result was controversial, as Martínez received the most first-place votes of any player (8 of 28), but was omitted from the ballots of two sportswriters, New York&#x27;s George King and Minneapolis&#x27; LaVelle Neal. Buster Olney, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, mused that the sentiment that pitchers should not be considered MVP candidates due to the existence of the pitcher-specific Cy Young Award may have cost Martínez the victory. King later wrote in The &quot;New York Post&quot; that he left Martínez off of his ballot because he believed that, since they only appear in a fraction of their team&#x27;s games, starting pitchers should only be considered for the Cy Young Award. &quot;It really made us all look very dumb&quot;, Olney later said. &quot;People were operating under different rules. The question of eligibility is a very basic thing. People were determining eligibility for themselves.&quot; Texas Rangers catcher Iván Rodríguez narrowly won the award over Martínez, by a margin of 252 points to 239. Rodríguez had been included on all 28 ballots. When asked about the result by WEEI-FM radio in January 2012, Martínez said, &quot;I&#x27;m not afraid to say that the way that George King and Mr. LaVelle Neal III went about it was unprofessional.&quot;
Between April and May 1999, Martínez struck out 10 or more batters in seven consecutive starts. Between August 1999 and April 2000, Martínez achieved the same feat in 10 consecutive starts, averaging more than 15 strikeouts per nine innings during the latter streak. In 1999, Martínez recorded a strikeout in 40 consecutive innings, which at the time was a major league record. For his career, Martínez compiled 15 or more strikeouts in a game 10 times, which is tied with Roger Clemens for the third-most such games in history behind Nolan Ryan&#x27;s 27 and Randy Johnson&#x27;s 29.

Martínez was named the AL Pitcher of the Month in April, May, June, and September 1999—four times in a single season. Martínez punctuated his dominance in the 1999 All-Star Game at Fenway Park. He struck out National League players Barry Larkin, Larry Walker, Sammy Sosa, Mark McGwire, and Jeff Bagwell in two innings pitched, earning All-Star Game MVP for his performance. It was the first time that a pitcher had struck out the first four batters to start an All-Star Game. Martínez later said that the 1999 All-Star break was especially memorable for him because he was able to meet the members of the MLB All-Century Team and get an autograph from Ted Williams.

Martínez was a focal point of Boston&#x27;s 1999 playoff series against the Cleveland Indians. Starting the series opener, he was forced out of the game after four shutout innings due to a strained back with the Red Sox up 2–0. The Red Sox, however, lost the game 3–2. With the series tied at two games apiece, Martínez was too injured to start the fifth and final game. However, neither team&#x27;s starter was effective, and by the middle of the fourth inning, the game was tied 8–8. At this point, Martínez entered the game as an emergency relief option. He pitched six no-hit innings, striking out eight and walking three, as the Red Sox won the deciding game of the series 12–8. In the American League Championship Series, Martínez pitched seven shutout innings to beat the New York Yankees in Game 3, handing the soon-to-be World Series champions their only loss of the 1999 postseason.

Martínez followed up 1999 with another excellent season in 2000 en route to his third Cy Young Award. His ERA of 1.74 was the lowest American League total since 1978. The total was about a third of that year&#x27;s park-adjusted league ERA (4.97), resulting in an adjusted ERA+ of 291, the second highest single-season total in major league history among pitchers who threw more than 200 innings. Roger Clemens&#x27; 2000 ERA of 3.70 was the second lowest in the AL, but it was still more than double that of Martínez&#x27;s.

Martínez&#x27;s record was 18–6. In his six losses, he recorded 60 strikeouts, eight walks, and 30 hits allowed in 48 innings, with a 2.44 ERA and a 0.79 WHIP, while averaging eight innings per start. Martínez&#x27;s ERA in his losing games was lower than the best ERA in the National League (Kevin Brown&#x27;s 2.58) across all games. Martínez&#x27;s first loss of the year was a 1–0 complete game in which he had 17 strikeouts and one walk. All of Martínez&#x27;s losses were quality starts, and he pitched eight or more innings in all but one of his losses. Martínez received two runs or fewer of run support in 10 of his starts (over one-third of his starts); in such games, his ERA was a minuscule 1.25 with 4 complete games and 2 shutouts, but his win–loss record was 4–5.

Martínez&#x27;s WHIP in 2000 was 0.74, the second lowest total in major league history behind George Walker in 1940. However, Walker&#x27;s record came in a season in which he only pitched 49 innings, whereas Martínez pitched 217 innings in 2000. Martínez struck out an American League-leading 284 batters while only walking 32, thereby breaking his own record for the highest single-season strikeout-to-walk ratio (8.88) in American League history. Martínez held opposing hitters to a of .167/.213/.259 and recorded more than twice as many strikeouts (284) as hits allowed (128). When opposing teams had runners in scoring position, hitters&#x27; production against Martínez was reduced to a slash line of .133/.188/.219.

Across 1999 and 2000, Martínez allowed 288 hits and 69 walks in 430 innings, with 597 strikeouts, a 0.83 WHIP, and a 1.90 ERA. Some baseball pundits believe that given the era in which Martínez pitched—during the peak of the Steroid Era, in a league with a designated hitter, with hitter-friendly Fenway Park as his home field—his performance represents the peak for any pitcher in baseball history.

Though he continued his dominance when healthy, carrying a sub-2.00 ERA to the midpoint of the following season, Martínez spent much of 2001 on the disabled list with a rotator cuff injury as the Red Sox slumped to a poor finish. Martínez finished with a 7–3 record, a 2.39 ERA, and 163 strikeouts in 116 innings. Healthy in 2002, he rebounded to lead the league with a 2.26 ERA, 0.923 WHIP and 239 strikeouts, while going 20–4. However, that season&#x27;s American League Cy Young Award narrowly went to 23-game winner Barry Zito of the Oakland Athletics, despite Zito&#x27;s higher ERA, higher WHIP, fewer strikeouts, and lower winning percentage. Martínez became the first pitcher since the introduction of the Cy Young Award to lead his league in each of those four statistics without winning the award. Martínez&#x27;s record was 14–4 in 2003. He led the league in ERA (2.22), ERA+ (211), and WHIP (1.04) for the fifth time each and finished second to league leader Esteban Loaiza by a single strikeout. Martínez came in third for the 2003 Cy Young Award, which went to Toronto&#x27;s Roy Halladay.
Despite an uncharacteristically high 3.90 ERA in 2004, Martínez went 16–9, ranked second in the AL in strikeouts and finished fourth in Cy Young voting. The Red Sox won the American League&#x27;s wild-card berth, and Martínez pitched effectively in the playoffs. He earned the win in Game 2 of the ALDS, and in the ALCS, he recorded his only loss of the postseason as well as a no-decision. In Game 3 of the World Series, he pitched seven shutout innings and retired the last 14 batters he faced. The Red Sox won the World Series in four games, securing their first championship in 86 years.

Martínez finished his Red Sox career with a 117–37 record (a .760 winning percentage), a 2.52 ERA, a 190 ERA+, and 1683 strikeouts in innings. He finished in the top four in Cy Young Award balloting in six of his seven years in Boston, winning twice.

===New York Mets===

After Boston&#x27;s World Series triumph in 2004, Martínez became a free agent and signed a four-year, $53 million contract with the New York Mets. In 2005, his first season as a Met, Martínez posted a 15–8 record with a 2.82 ERA, 208 strikeouts, and a league-leading 0.95 WHIP. It was his sixth league WHIP title, and the fifth time that he led the Major Leagues in the category. Opponents batted .204 against him.

Martínez started the 2006 season at the top of his game. At the end of May, he was 5–1 with a 2.50 ERA, with 88 strikeouts and 17 walks and 44 hits allowed in 76 innings; Martínez&#x27;s record was worse than it could have been, with the Mets bullpen costing him two victories. However, during his May 26 start against the Florida Marlins, Martínez was instructed by the umpires to change his undershirt. He slipped in the corridor, injuring his hip, and his promising season curdled. The effect was not immediately apparent; although Martínez lost the Marlins game, his following start was a scintillating 0–0 duel with Arizona&#x27;s Brandon Webb. But after that, beginning on June 6, Martínez went 4–7 with a 7.10 ERA in a series of spotty starts interrupted twice by stays on the disabled list. A right calf injury plagued him for the last two months of the season. After Martínez was removed from an ineffective September 15 outing, television cameras found him in the Mets dugout, apparently crying. Subsequent MRI exams revealed a torn muscle in Martínez&#x27;s left calf and a torn rotator cuff. Martínez underwent surgery which sidelined him for most of the 2007 season.
On November 3, 2006, Martínez stated that if he could not return to full strength, he might end up retiring after the 2007 season. &quot;It&#x27;s getting better, and progress is above all what is hoped for&quot;, Martínez told the Associated Press. &quot;To go back, I have to recover, I have to be healthy. But if God doesn&#x27;t want that, then I would have to think about giving it all up.&quot; Martínez added, &quot;It&#x27;s going to be a bitter winter because I am going to have to do a lot of work. The pain I feel was one of the worst I have felt with any injury in my career.&quot; But by December 30, 2006, Martínez was more optimistic: &quot;The progress has been excellent. I don&#x27;t have problems anymore with my reach or flexibility, and so far everything is going very well. The problem has to do with the calcification of the bone that was broken with the tear, and that had to be operated on. You have to let it run its course.&quot; Martínez also reported bulking up as part of his recuperative regimen: &quot;I&#x27;ve put on about 10 pounds of muscle, because that&#x27;s one of our strategies.&quot;

On September 3, 2007, Martínez returned from the disabled list with his 207th career win, allowing two earned runs in five efficient innings and collecting his 3,000th career strikeout, becoming the 15th pitcher to do so. &quot;I thought I was going to have butterflies and like that&quot;, said Martínez, &quot;but I guess I&#x27;m too old.&quot; Martínez&#x27;s comeback was considered a great success, as the right-hander went 3–1 in five starts with a 2.57 ERA. But his last start was a crucial 3–0 loss to St. Louis in the final week of the 2007 Mets&#x27; historic collapse; Martínez provided a good pitching performance (7 IP, 2 ER, 7 H, 1 BB, 8 K) but his teammates failed to score.

Martínez became just the fourth pitcher to reach 3,000 strikeouts with fewer than 1,000 walks (in Martínez&#x27;s case, 701). Ferguson Jenkins, Greg Maddux and Curt Schilling had previously done likewise. Martínez also joined Nolan Ryan and Randy Johnson to become the third 3,000-strikeout pitcher to have more strikeouts than innings pitched, and is also the first Latin American pitcher to have 3,000 strikeouts.

His unexpectedly strong finish in 2007 raised hopes, but 2008 was a lost season for Martínez. He was injured just four innings into his first game of the season, an April 1 no-decision against the Florida Marlins. He later told reporters he&#x27;d felt a &quot;pop&quot; in his left leg. Martínez was diagnosed with a strained hamstring and did not return to action for more than two months. Following his return, his fastball typically topped out in the 90–91 mph range, a lower velocity than he&#x27;d had during his prime but slightly higher than in recent seasons. Martínez finished the season on a low note, losing all three of his decisions in September en route to a 5–6 record, the first losing record of his career. (Martínez was 0–1 in two appearances in 1992.) His 5.61 ERA and 1.57 WHIP were also Martínez&#x27;s worst ever, and for the first time in his career, he failed to strike out at least twice as many batters as he walked (87–44).

During his four-year Met contract, Martínez was 32–23 in 79 starts, with a 3.88 ERA and a 1.16 WHIP.

===Philadelphia Phillies===

A free agent, Martínez did not sign with a major league team during the winter. In March, he joined the Dominican Republic&#x27;s squad for the 2009 World Baseball Classic, in an attempt to showcase his arm. Martínez pitched six scoreless innings with 6 strikeouts and no walks, but the team was quickly eliminated from the tournament and no MLB contract was forthcoming. In July 2009, Phillies scouts evaluated Martínez in two simulated games against the Phillies DSL team, leading to a one-year, $1-million contract. Martínez told reporters, &quot;I would just like to be the backup. If I could be the backup, that would be a great thing to have—a healthy Pedro behind everybody else, in case something happens. That would be a great feeling to have on a team, eh?&quot;
Replacing Jamie Moyer as a starter in the Phillies rotation on August 12, Martínez won his 2009 debut. In his return to New York on August 23, Martínez&#x27;s win against the Mets was preserved by a rare unassisted triple play by second baseman Eric Bruntlett in the bottom of the ninth inning. With his win on September 3—his third as a Philadelphia Phillie and his 100th as a National Leaguer—Martínez became the 10th pitcher in history to win at least 100 games in each league. On September 13, Martínez pitched eight innings to beat the Mets again, by a final score of 1–0. His 130 pitches were the most he had thrown in a game since the ALDS in October 2003. Philadelphia won each of Martínez&#x27;s first seven starts, the first time in franchise history that this had occurred with any debuting Phillies pitcher. In the NLCS against the Los Angeles Dodgers, he pitched seven shutout innings while allowing just two hits, but the Philadelphia bullpen faltered in the following inning, costing Martínez the win.

Intense media interest preceded Martínez&#x27;s &quot;return to Yankee Stadium&quot; in Game 2 of the World Series. At the pre-game press conference, he seemed to relish the attention, telling reporters, &quot;When you have 60,000 people chanting your name, waiting for you to throw the ball, you have to consider yourself someone special, someone that really has a purpose out there.&quot; Martínez pitched effectively in his second-ever World Series start, but left the game in the 7th inning trailing, 2–1, and wound up taking the loss. Before his second start of the Series, Martínez called himself and opposing pitcher Andy Pettitte &quot;old goats&quot;, and acknowledged that Red Sox fans were rooting for him: &quot;I know that they don&#x27;t like the Yankees to win, not even in Nintendo games.&quot; However, Martínez allowed four runs in four innings, falling to 0–2 as the Phillies lost the sixth game and the 2009 World Series to the New York Yankees.

Following the Series, Martínez announced that he had no intention of retiring, but the 2010 season came and went without his signing with a team. Media reports surfaced that the Phillies had been discussing a deal to bring Martínez back for another half-season, but Martínez&#x27;s agent announced in July that he would not be pitching at all in 2010, while remaining interested in a 2011 return. In December 2010, Martínez told a reporter for &quot;El Día&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m realizing what it is to be a normal person. ... It&#x27;s most likely that I don&#x27;t return to active baseball ... but honestly I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll definitively announce my retirement.&quot; The pitcher received some initial inquiries during the winter, but did not sign with any team for 2011. On December 4, 2011, he officially announced his retirement.

In December 2009, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named Martínez as one of the five pitchers in the starting rotation of its MLB All-Decade Team. In February 2011, the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery announced that it had acquired an oil painting of Martínez for its collection.

===After retirement===

On January 24, 2013, Martínez joined the Boston Red Sox as a special assistant to general manager Ben Cherington.

Martínez was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in January 2015 with 91.1% of the vote. His Hall of Fame plaque has him wearing a Boston Red Sox cap. &quot;I cannot be any prouder to take Red Sox Nation to the Hall of Fame with the logo on my plaque&quot;, Martínez said in a statement. &quot;I am extremely proud to represent Boston and all of New England with my Hall of Fame career. I&#x27;m grateful to all of the teams for which I played, and especially fans, for making this amazing honor come true.&quot;

Martínez has worked on MLB on TBS since 2013 as a studio analyst for postseason coverage. He has also worked on the MLB Network since 2015 as a studio analyst. Also in 2015, he released an autobiography, &quot;Pedro&quot;, which he co-authored with Michael Silverman of the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;. Reflecting on his career, he named Barry Bonds, Edgar Martínez, Derek Jeter, Kenny Lofton and Ichiro Suzuki as the most difficult hitters he had to face. All-Stars Sandy Alomar Jr., Moisés Alou, Carlos Beltrán, Carlos Delgado, David Ortiz, Dean Palmer, Alex Rodriguez and Alfonso Soriano have named Martínez as the toughest pitcher they ever had to face.

On June 22, 2015, it was announced that Martínez&#x27;s number 45 would be retired by the Red Sox on July 28, two days after his Hall of Fame induction. Red Sox principal owner John Henry stated, &quot;to be elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame upon his first year of eligibility speaks volumes regarding Pedro&#x27;s outstanding career, and is a testament to the respect and admiration so many in baseball have for him.&quot;

On February 1, 2018, Martínez was announced as part of the 2018 induction class for the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame.

==Memorable games==

===Imperfect hit-by-pitch===
On April 13, 1994, in his second start as a Montreal Expo, Martínez lost a perfect game with one out in the eighth inning when he hit Cincinnati&#x27;s Reggie Sanders with a pitch. An angered Sanders charged the mound, and threw Martínez to the ground, before both teams cleared the benches and broke up the fight. Sanders was later ridiculed in the press for assuming that a pitcher would abandon a perfect game in order to hit a batter intentionally. Martínez allowed a leadoff single in the ninth inning, breaking up his no-hitter, and was removed for reliever John Wetteland (who loaded the bases, then allowed two sacrifice flies, thus saddling Martínez with a no-decision). Three years later, in 1997, Martínez had a one-hitter against the Reds; the one hit came in the 5th inning.

===Nine perfect innings===
On June 3, 1995, while pitching for Montreal, he retired the first 27 Padres hitters he faced. However, the score was still tied 0–0 at that point and the game went into extra innings. The Expos scored a run in the top of the 10th, but Martínez surrendered a double to the 28th batter he faced, Bip Roberts. Expos manager Felipe Alou then removed Martínez from the game, bringing in reliever Mel Rojas, who retired the next three batters. Martínez officially recorded neither a perfect game nor a no-hitter. Until 1991, the rules would have judged it differently; however, a rule clarification specified that perfect games, even beyond nine innings, must remain perfect until the game is completed for them to be considered perfect. This retroactively decertified many no-hit games, including Ernie Shore&#x27;s perfect relief stint in 1917 and Harvey Haddix&#x27;s legendary 12 perfect innings in 1959 (lost in the 13th).

===All-Star strikeout streak===
Martínez was selected as the starting pitcher for the American League All-Star team in 1999. The game, on July 13, 1999, was at Fenway Park, Martínez&#x27;s home field. Martínez struck out Barry Larkin, Larry Walker, and Sammy Sosa consecutively in the first inning. He then struck out Mark McGwire leading off the 2nd, becoming the first pitcher to begin an All-Star game by striking out the first four batters. (The National League&#x27;s Brad Penny matched the feat in 2006.) The next batter, Matt Williams, managed to reach first base from an error by Roberto Alomar. Martínez then proceeded to strike out Jeff Bagwell while Williams was caught stealing.

===Yankee Stadium one-hitter===
Martínez again came close to a perfect game on September 10, 1999, when he beat the New York Yankees, 3–1. He faced just 28 batters while striking out 17 and walking none (Martínez hit the Yankees&#x27; first batter, Chuck Knoblauch, but he was then caught stealing). Only a solo home run by Chili Davis separated Martínez from a no-hitter. The Davis home run came in the second inning, eliminating any suspense, but sportswriter Thomas Boswell called it the best game ever pitched at Yankee Stadium. Martínez retired the last 22 batters he faced in a row during this game. Over the last innings, (11 batters), Martínez threw 53 consecutive pitches without allowing a base runner, and without a single ball being put in play. (Nine strikeouts, two foul-ball fly outs.) The Yankees managed only one fair ball out of his last 70 pitches after the fourth inning.

===Hitless clincher===
On October 11, 1999, in Game 5 of the ALDS, Charles Nagy started for Cleveland and Bret Saberhagen started for Boston, both on only three days rest. Boston jumped out to a quick two-run lead in the top of the first inning, but Cleveland responded with three runs of their own in the bottom half of the inning. The hitting continued, knocking Saberhagen out of the game in the second inning having allowed five runs, and then Nagy out of the game after only finishing only three innings and allowing eight runs. Going into the fourth inning, manager Jimy Williams opted to replace Derek Lowe with the ailing Martínez, who had left Game 1 with a back injury. This decision would prove to be wise, as Martínez threw six hitless innings in relief to win and clinch the ALDS.

===1999 ALCS===
Game 3 of the American League Championship Series was the long-anticipated matchup between Martínez and Roger Clemens. The Red Sox scored first. After a leadoff triple by Offerman, Valentin homered to put the Red Sox ahead 2–0. The onslaught continued as the Red Sox scored in all but two innings. Clemens was done in the third inning and the Red Sox would go on to win 13–1 and make the series two games to one. When Clemens was knocked out, Red Sox fans chanted &quot;Where is Roger?&quot; and then a response chant of &quot;In the Shower&quot;. Martínez struck out 12 Yankees in seven scoreless innings and allowing just two hits, to beat Red Sox nemesis Roger Clemens and the New York Yankees in Game 3, handing the World Champions their only loss of the 1999 postseason. Martínez finished 1999 with a streak of 17 scoreless innings in the playoffs.

===Faceoff vs. Roger Clemens on ESPN===
On May 28, 2000, Martínez and Roger Clemens had a dramatic duel on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; telecast. Both pitchers excelled, combining to allow only nine hits and one walk while striking out 22. A scoreless game was finally broken up in the 9th inning by Trot Nixon&#x27;s home run off Clemens. In the bottom of the ninth, the Yankees loaded the bases against a tiring Martínez, but New York could not score, as Martínez completed the shutout.

===Another close call===
On August 29, 2000, Martínez took a no-hitter into the 9th against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, losing it on a leadoff single by John Flaherty. Martínez had begun the night by hitting the leadoff batter, Gerald Williams, in the hand. Williams started towards first base before charging the mound and knocking down Martínez; in the scrum, Williams was tackled by Boston catcher Jason Varitek. Martínez then retired the next 24 hitters in a row until allowing Flaherty&#x27;s single, and finished with a one-hitter. He had 13 strikeouts and no walks in the game; the Flaherty single would have broken up a perfect game, if not for the leadoff hit batsman. Martínez never threw an official no-hitter. However, he has professed a lack of interest in the matter: &quot;I think my career is more interesting than one game.&quot;

===Martínez vs. Zimmer===
In the testy Game 3 of the 2003 ALCS, after allowing single runs in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th innings, Martínez hit Yankees right fielder Karim García near the shoulders with a pitch, sparking a shouting match between Martínez and the New York bench. Directing his attention at Yankees catcher Jorge Posada, Martínez jabbed a finger into the side of his own head, which some, including an enraged Yankee bench coach Don Zimmer, interpreted as a threatened beanball. Emotions remained high in the bottom of the inning, which was led off by Boston slugger Manny Ramírez. Ramírez became irate over a high pitch from Roger Clemens, and both benches cleared. During the ensuing commotion, the 72-year-old Zimmer ran onto the field and started straight for Martínez; as he charged, Martínez grabbed Zimmer by the head and threw him to the ground. Later, Martínez claimed that he was not indicating that he would hit Posada in the head, but that he would remember what Posada was saying to him. In 2009, Martínez stated that he regretted the incident but denied being at fault. Zimmer did not give much credence to Martínez&#x27;s statements. Martínez wrote in 2015 that the altercation with Zimmer was his only regret in his entire career.

===Grady Little&#x27;s visit===
Martínez was also on the mound for Game 7 of the 2003 ALCS versus the Yankees. With the Red Sox ahead 5–2 at the start of the 8th inning, a tiring Martínez pitched his way into trouble. He was visited on the mound by manager Grady Little, but was left in to pitch, in a controversial non-move. The Yankees tied the score against Martínez in that inning on four successive hits, leading to a dramatic extra-inning, series-ending victory for New York, costing Grady Little his job with the Red Sox as his contract was not renewed.

===World Series debut===
After a comparatively lackluster season in 2004 (though still a solid season by general standards), Martínez got the win in Game 3 of the World Series. He shut out the St. Louis Cardinals through seven innings, recording his final 14 outs consecutively in what would turn out to be his last game for Boston.

===Mets===
With the Mets, on April 10, 2005, at Turner Field, Martínez outdueled John Smoltz, pitching a two-hit, one-run, complete game en route to his first Mets victory. On August 14, 2005, against the Dodgers, he pitched hitless innings, but ended up losing the no-hitter and the game.

===Return to Fenway===
In June 2006, the Mets played an interleague series against the Red Sox, which was Martínez&#x27;s first appearance at Fenway Park since leaving the team. The Red Sox gave their former ace a two-minute video tribute on June 27, but showed no courtesies to Martínez the following night. In his June 28, 2006 start, Martínez lasted only three innings, and was rocked for eight runs (six earned) on seven hits, losing his worst game as a Met just before going onto the disabled list. It was Martínez&#x27;s only career appearance against the Red Sox, the only Major League team against which he did not record a victory.

===Who&#x27;s Your Daddy?===
In both the 2004 ALCS and the 2009 World Series, Martínez was greeted with the chant &quot;Who&#x27;s your daddy?&quot; from New York Yankees fans whenever Martínez was pitching due to his statement on September 24, 2004, saying, &quot;I mean what can I say? Just tip my hat and call the Yankees my daddy.&quot;

==Pitching style==
Martínez&#x27;s four-seam fastball, power curveball, cutter, sinker, and circle changeup were all well above average; combined with his historically excellent control, they proved to be an overpowering package. Martínez threw from a low three-quarters position (nearly sidearm) that hid the ball very well from batters, who have remarked on the difficulty of picking up Martínez&#x27;s delivery. Additionally, Martínez threw three different types of fastballs - a straight high-velocity four-seam fastball he used to overpower hitters, a two-seamer that ran to his throwing arm side, and a cut fastball that ran away from his throwing arm side - each with the pinpoint control that defined him.

Early in his career, Martínez&#x27;s fastball was consistently clocked in the 95–98 mph range. Using it in combination with his devastating changeup and occasionally mixing in his curveball, he was as dominant a pitcher as the game has ever seen. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s Joe Posnanski wrote, &quot;There has never been a pitcher in baseball history—not Walter Johnson, not Lefty Grove, not Sandy Koufax, not Tom Seaver, not Roger Clemens—who was more overwhelming than the young Pedro.&quot;

As injuries and the aging process took their toll, Martínez made the adjustment to rely more on finesse than power. His fastball settled into the 85–88 mph range, although he was occasionally able to reach 90–91 mph when the need arose. Martínez continued to use a curveball, a circle changeup, and an occasional slider. With his command of the strike zone, he remained an effective strikeout pitcher despite the drop in velocity. Baseball historian Bill James described Martínez as being substantially more effective than his pitching peers due to his variety of pitches, pitch speeds, pinpoint control, and numerous modes of deception.

==Personal life==
Pedro is married to former ESPN Deportes sideline reporter Carolina Cruz de Martínez, who now runs his charitable organization, Pedro Martínez and Brothers Foundation. He has four children. One of his sons, Pedro Martínez Jr., signed with the Detroit Tigers as an international free agent in September 2017. Another son, Pedro Isaías Martínez, signed at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Pedro Jr. now plays for the Malone Border Hounds of the Empire Professional Baseball League in Northern New York. He also has another son, Enyol Martínez, and a daughter, Nayla Martínez. Pedro has been a naturalized American citizen since 2006.

<text>The Picts were a group of peoples in what is now Scotland north of the Firth of Forth, in the Early Middle Ages. Where they lived and details of their culture can be gleaned from early medieval texts and Pictish stones. The name appears in written records as an exonym from the late third century AD. They are assumed to have been descendants of the Caledonii and other northern Iron Age tribes. Their territory is referred to as &quot;Pictland&quot; by modern historians. Initially made up of several chiefdoms, it came to be dominated by the Pictish kingdom of Fortriu from the seventh century. During this Verturian hegemony, &quot;Picti&quot; was adopted as an endonym. This lasted around 160 years until the Pictish kingdom merged with that of Dál Riata to form the Kingdom of Alba, ruled by the House of Alpin. The concept of &quot;Pictish kingship&quot; continued for a few decades until it was abandoned during the reign of Caustantín mac Áeda.

Pictish society was typical of many early medieval societies in northern Europe and had parallels with neighbouring groups. Archaeology gives some impression of their culture. Medieval sources report the existence of a Pictish language, and evidence shows that it was an Insular Celtic language related to the Brittonic spoken by the Celtic Britons to the south. Pictish was gradually displaced by Middle Gaelic as part of the wider Gaelicisation from the late ninth century. Much of their history is known from outside sources, including Bede, hagiographies of saints such as that of Columba by Adomnán, and the Irish annals.

==Definitions==
There has been substantial critical reappraisal of the concept of &quot;Pictishness&quot; over recent decades. The popular view at the beginning of the twentieth century was that they were exotic &quot;lost people&quot;. It was noted in the highly influential work of 1955, &quot;The Problem of the Picts&quot;, that the subject area was difficult, with the archaeological and historical records frequently being at odds with the conventional essentialist expectations about historical peoples. Since then, the culture-historical paradigm of archaeology dominant since the late nineteenth century gave way to the processual archaeology (formerly known as the &quot;New Archaeology&quot;) theory. Moreover, there has been significant reappraisal of textual sources written, for example by Bede and Adomnán in the seventh and eighth centuries. These works relate events of previous centuries, but current scholarship recognises their often allegorical, pseudo-historical nature, and their true value often lies in an appraisal of the time period in which they were written.

The difficulties with Pictish history and archaeology arise from the fact that the people who were called Picts were a fundamentally heterogeneous group with little cultural uniformity. Care is needed to avoid viewing them through the lens of what the cultural historian Gilbert Márkus calls the &quot;Ethnic Fallacy&quot;. The people known as &quot;Picts&quot; by outsiders in late antiquity were very different from those who later adopted the name, in terms of language, culture, religion and politics.

The term &quot;Pict&quot; is found in Roman sources from the end of the third century AD, when it was used to describe unromanised people in northern Britain. The term is most likely to have been pejorative, emphasising their supposed barbarism in contrast to the Britons under Roman rule. It has been argued, most notably by James Fraser, that the term &quot;Pict&quot; would have had little meaning to the people to whom it was being applied. Fraser posits that it was only adopted as an endonym in the late seventh century, as an inclusive term for people under rule of the Verturian hegemony, centered in Fortriu (the area around modern-day Inverness and Moray), particularly following the Battle of Dun Nechtain. This view is, however, not universal. Gordon Noble and Nicholas Evans consider it plausible, if not provable, that &quot;Picts&quot; may have been used as an endonym by those northern Britons in closest contact with Rome as early as the fourth century. 

The bulk of written history dates from the seventh century onwards. The Irish annalists and contemporary scholars like Bede use &quot;Picts&quot; to describe the peoples under the Verturian hegemony. This encompassed most of Scotland north of the Forth-Clyde isthmus and to the exclusion of territory occupied by Dál Riata in the west. To the south lay the Brittonic kingdom of Strathclyde, with Lothian occupied by Northumbrian Angles. The use of &quot;Picts&quot; as a descriptive term continued to the formation of the Alpínid dynasty in the ninth century, and the merging of the Pictish Kingdom with that of Dál Riata.

==Etymology==

The Latin word first occurs in a panegyric, a formal eulogising speech from 297 and is most commonly explained as meaning &#x27;painted&#x27; (from Latin &#x27;to paint&#x27;; , &#x27;painted&#x27;, cf. Greek , &#x27;picture&#x27;). This is generally understood to be a reference to the practice of tattooing. Claudian, in his account of the Roman commander Stilicho, written around 404, speaks of designs on the bodies of dying Picts, presumably referring to tattoos or body paint. Isidore of Seville reports in the early seventh century that the practice was continued by the Picts. An alternative suggestion is that the Latin &quot;Picti&quot; was derived from a native form, perhaps related etymologically to the Gallic Pictones. 

The Picts were called &quot;Cruithni&quot; in Old Irish and &quot;Prydyn&quot; in Old Welsh. These are lexical cognates, from the proto-Celtic *&quot;kwritu&quot; &#x27;form&#x27;, from which *&quot;Pretania&quot; (Britain) also derives. &quot;Pretani&quot; (and with it &quot;Cruithni&quot; and &quot;Prydyn&quot;) is likely to have originated as a generalised term for any native inhabitant of Britain. This is similar to the situation with the Gaelic name of Scotland, &quot;Alba&quot;, which originally seems to have been a generalised term for Britain. It has been proposed that the Picts may have called themselves &quot;Albidosi&quot;, a name found in the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba during the reign of Máel Coluim mac Domnaill.

==Origins==
The origin myth presented in Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; describes the Picts as settlers from Scythia who arrived on the northern coast of Ireland by chance. Local Scoti leaders redirected them to northern Britain where they settled, taking Scoti wives. The &quot;Pictish Chronicle&quot;, repeating this story, further names the mythical founding leader &quot;Cruithne&quot; (the Gaelic word for &quot;Pict&quot;), followed by his sons, whose names correspond with the seven provinces of Pictland: &quot;Circin&quot;, &quot;Fidach&quot;, &quot;Fortriu&quot;, &quot;Fotla&quot; (&quot;Atholl&quot;), &quot;Cat&quot;, &quot;Ce&quot; and &quot;Fib&quot;. Bede&#x27;s account has long been recognised as pseudohistorical literary invention, and is thought to be of Pictish origin, composed around 700. Its structure is similar to the origin myths of other peoples and its main purpose appears to have been to legitimise the annexation of Pictish territories by Fortriu and the creation of a wider Pictland. 

A study published in 2023 sequenced the whole genomes from eight individuals associated with the Pictish period, excavated from cemeteries at Lundin Links in Fife and Balintore, Easter Ross. The study observed &quot;broad affinities&quot; between the mainland Pictish genomes, Iron Age Britons and the present-day people living in western Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Northumbria, but less with the rest of England, supporting the current archaeological theories of a &quot;local origin&quot; of the Pictish people.

==History==
The area occupied by the Picts had previously been described by Roman writers and geographers as the home of the &quot;Caledonii&quot;. These Romans also used other names to refer to Britannic tribes living in the area, including &quot;Verturiones&quot;, &quot;Taexali&quot; and &quot;Venicones&quot;.

Written history relating to the Picts as a people emerges in the Early Middle Ages. At that time, the Gaels of Dál Riata controlled what is now Argyll, as part of a kingdom straddling the sea between Britain and Ireland. The Angles of Bernicia, which merged with Deira to form Northumbria, overwhelmed the adjacent British kingdoms, and for much of the 7th century Northumbria was the most powerful kingdom in Britain. The Picts were probably tributary to Northumbria until the reign of Bridei mac Beli, when, in 685, the Anglians suffered a defeat at the Battle of Dun Nechtain that halted their northward expansion. The Northumbrians continued to dominate southern Scotland for the remainder of the Pictish period.
Dál Riata was subject to the Pictish king Óengus mac Fergusa (reigned 729–761), and although it had its own kings beginning in the 760s, does not appear to have recovered its political independence from the Picts. A later Pictish king, Caustantín mac Fergusa (793–820), placed his son Domnall on the throne of Dál Riata (811–835). Pictish attempts to achieve a similar dominance over the Britons of Alt Clut (Strathclyde) were not successful.

The Viking Age brought significant change to Britain and Ireland, no less in Scotland than elsewhere, with the Vikings conquering and settling the islands and various mainland areas, including Caithness, Sutherland and Galloway. In the middle of the 9th century Ketil Flatnose is said to have founded the Kingdom of the Isles, governing many of these territories, and by the end of that century the Vikings had destroyed the Kingdom of Northumbria, greatly weakened the Kingdom of Strathclyde, and founded the Kingdom of York. In a major battle in 839, the Vikings killed the King of Fortriu, Eógan mac Óengusa, the King of Dál Riata Áed mac Boanta, and many others. In the aftermath, in the 840s, Kenneth MacAlpin () became king of the Picts.

During the reign of Cínaed&#x27;s grandson, Caustantín mac Áeda (900–943), outsiders began to refer to the region as the Kingdom of Alba rather than the Kingdom of the Picts, but it is not known whether this was because a new kingdom was established or Alba was simply a closer approximation of the Pictish name for the Picts. However, though the Pictish language did not disappear suddenly, a process of Gaelicisation (which may have begun generations earlier) was clearly underway during the reigns of Caustantín and his successors. 

By a certain point, probably during the 11th century, all the inhabitants of northern Alba had become fully Gaelicised Scots, and Pictish identity was forgotten. Henry of Huntingdon was one of the first (surviving) historians to note this disappearance in the mid-12th century &quot;Historia Anglorum&quot;. Later, the idea of Picts as a tribe was revived in myth and legend.

==Kings and kingdoms==

The early history of Pictland is unclear. In later periods, multiple kings ruled over separate kingdoms, with one king, sometimes two, more or less dominating their lesser neighbours. &quot;De Situ Albanie&quot;, a 13th century document, the Pictish Chronicle, the 11th century &quot;Duan Albanach&quot;, along with Irish legends, have been used to argue the existence of seven Pictish kingdoms. These are: Cait, or Cat, situated in modern Caithness and Sutherland; Ce, situated in modern Mar and Buchan; Circin, perhaps situated in modern Angus and the Mearns; Fib, the modern Fife; Fidach, location unknown, but possibly near Inverness; Fotla, modern Atholl (&quot;Ath-Fotla&quot;); and Fortriu, cognate with the &quot;Verturiones&quot; of the Romans, recently shown to be centred on Moray.

More small kingdoms may have existed. Some evidence suggests that a Pictish kingdom also existed in Orkney. &quot;De Situ Albanie&quot; is not the most reliable of sources, and the number of kingdoms, one for each of the seven sons of &quot;Cruithne&quot;, the eponymous founder of the Picts, may well be grounds enough for disbelief. Regardless of the exact number of kingdoms and their names, the Pictish nation was not a united one.

For most of Pictish recorded history, the kingdom of Fortriu appears dominant, so much so that &quot;king of Fortriu&quot; and &quot;king of the Picts&quot; may mean one and the same thing in the annals. This was previously thought to lie in the area around Perth and southern Strathearn; however, recent work has convinced those working in the field that Moray (a name referring to a very much larger area in the High Middle Ages than the county of Moray) was the core of Fortriu.

The Picts are often thought to have practised matrilineal kingship succession on the basis of Irish legends and a statement in Bede&#x27;s history. The kings of the Picts when Bede was writing were Bridei and Nechtan, sons of Der Ilei, who indeed claimed the throne through their mother Der Ilei, daughter of an earlier Pictish king.

In Ireland, kings were expected to come from among those who had a great-grandfather who had been king. Kingly fathers were not frequently succeeded by their sons, not because the Picts practised matrilineal succession, but because they were usually followed by their own brothers or cousins (agnatic seniority), more likely to be experienced men with the authority and the support necessary to be king. This was similar to tanistry.

The only woman ruler, mentioned in early Scottish history, is the Pictish Queen in 617, who summoned pirates to massacre Donnán and his companions on the island of Eigg.

The nature of kingship changed considerably during the centuries of Pictish history. While earlier kings had to be successful war leaders to maintain their authority, kingship became rather less personalised and more institutionalised during this time. Bureaucratic kingship was still far in the future when Pictland became Alba, but the support of the church, and the apparent ability of a small number of families to control the kingship for much of the period from the later 7th century onwards, provided a considerable degree of continuity. In much the same period, the Picts&#x27; neighbours in Dál Riata and Northumbria faced considerable difficulties, as the stability of succession and rule that previously benefited them ended.

The later Mormaers are thought to have originated in Pictish times, and to have been copied from, or inspired by, Northumbrian usages. It is unclear whether the Mormaers were originally former kings, royal officials, or local nobles, or some combination of these. Likewise, the Pictish shires and thanages, traces of which are found in later times, are thought to have been adopted from their southern neighbours.

==Society==

The archaeological record gives insight into the Picts&#x27; material culture, and suggest a society not readily distinguishable from its 
British, Gaelic, or Anglo-Saxon neighbours. Although analogy and knowledge of other Celtic societies may be a useful guide, these extend across a very large area. Relying on knowledge of pre-Roman Gaul, or 13th-century Ireland, as a guide to the Picts of the 6th century may be misleading if the analogy is pursued too far.

Like most northern European people in Late Antiquity, the Picts were farmers living in small communities. Cattle and horses were an obvious sign of wealth and prestige. Sheep and pigs were kept in large numbers, and place names suggest that transhumance was common. Animals were small by later standards, although horses from Britain were imported into Ireland as breeding stock to enlarge native horses. From Irish sources, it appears that the elite engaged in competitive cattle breeding for size, and this may have been the case in Pictland also. Carvings show hunting with dogs, and also, unlike in Ireland, with falcons. Cereal crops included wheat, barley, oats and rye. Vegetables included kale, cabbage, onions and leeks, peas and beans and turnips, and some types no longer common, such as skirret. Plants such as wild garlic, nettles and watercress may have been gathered in the wild. The pastoral economy meant that hides and leather were readily available. Wool was the main source of fibres for clothing, and flax was also common, although it is not clear if they grew it for fibres, for oil, or as a foodstuff. Fish, shellfish, seals, and whales were exploited along coasts and rivers. The importance of domesticated animals suggests that meat and milk products were a major part of the diet of ordinary people, while the elite would have eaten a diet rich in meat from farming and hunting.

No Pictish counterparts to the areas of denser settlement around important fortresses in Gaul and southern Britain, or any other significant urban settlements, are known. Larger, but not large, settlements existed around royal forts, such as at Burghead Fort, or associated with religious foundations. No towns are known in Scotland until the 12th century.

The technology of everyday life is not well recorded, but archaeological evidence shows it to have been similar to that in Ireland and Anglo-Saxon England. Recently evidence has been found of watermills in Pictland. Kilns were used for drying kernels of wheat or barley, not otherwise easy in the changeable, temperate climate.
The early Picts are associated with piracy and raiding along the coasts of Roman Britain. Even in the Late Middle Ages, the line between traders and pirates was unclear, so that Pictish pirates were probably merchants on other occasions. It is generally assumed that trade collapsed with the Roman Empire, but this is to overstate the case. There is only limited evidence of long-distance trade with Pictland, but tableware and storage vessels from Gaul, probably transported up the Irish Sea, have been found. This trade may have been controlled from Dunadd in Dál Riata, where such goods appear to have been common. While long-distance travel was unusual in Pictish times, it was far from unknown as stories of missionaries, travelling clerics and exiles show.

Brochs are popularly associated with the Picts. Although built earlier in the Iron Age, with construction ending around 100 AD, they remained in use beyond the Pictish period. Crannogs, which may originate in Neolithic Scotland, may have been rebuilt, and some were still in use in the time of the Picts. The most common sort of buildings would have been roundhouses and rectangular timbered halls. While many churches were built in wood, from the early 8th century, if not earlier, some were built in stone.

The Picts are often said to have tattooed themselves, but evidence for this is limited. Naturalistic depictions of Pictish nobles, hunters and warriors, male and female, without obvious tattoos, are found on monumental stones. These include inscriptions in Latin and ogham script, not all of which have been deciphered. The well-known Pictish symbols found on standing stones and other artefacts have defied attempts at translation over the centuries. Pictish art can be classed as &quot;Celtic&quot; and later as Insular. Irish poets portrayed their Pictish counterparts as very much like themselves.

==Religion==

Early Pictish religion is presumed to have resembled Celtic polytheism in general, although only place names remain from the pre-Christian era. When the Pictish elite converted to Christianity is uncertain, but traditions place Saint Palladius in Pictland after he left Ireland, and link Abernethy with Saint Brigid of Kildare. Saint Patrick refers to &quot;apostate Picts&quot;, while the poem &quot;Y Gododdin&quot; does not remark on the Picts as pagans. Bede wrote that Saint Ninian (confused by some with Saint Finnian of Moville, who died ), had converted the southern Picts. Recent archaeological work at Portmahomack places the foundation of the monastery there, an area once assumed to be among the last converted, in the late 6th century. This is contemporary with Bridei mac Maelchon and Columba, but the process of establishing Christianity throughout Pictland will have extended over a much longer period.

Pictland was not solely influenced by Iona and Ireland. It also had ties to churches in Northumbria, as seen in the reign of Nechtan mac Der Ilei. The reported expulsion of Ionan monks and clergy by Nechtan in 717 may have been related to the controversy over the dating of Easter, and the manner of tonsure, where Nechtan appears to have supported the Roman usages, but may equally have been intended to increase royal power over the church. Nonetheless, the evidence of place names suggests a wide area of Ionan influence in Pictland. Likewise, the &quot;Cáin Adomnáin&quot; (Law of Adomnán, &quot;Lex Innocentium&quot;) counts Nechtan&#x27;s brother Bridei among its guarantors.

The importance of monastic centres in Pictland was not as great as in Ireland. In areas that have been studied, such as Strathspey and Perthshire, it appears that the parochial structure of the High Middle Ages existed in early medieval times. Among the major religious sites of eastern Pictland were Portmahomack, Cennrígmonaid (later St Andrews), Dunkeld, Abernethy and Rosemarkie. It appears that these are associated with Pictish kings, which argue for a considerable degree of royal patronage and control of the church. Portmahomack in particular has been the subject of recent excavation and research, published by Martin Carver.

The cult of saints was, as throughout Christian lands, of great importance in later Pictland. While kings might venerate great saints, such as Saint Peter in the case of Nechtan, and perhaps Saint Andrew in the case of the second Óengus mac Fergusa, many lesser saints, some now obscure, were important. The Pictish Saint Drostan appears to have had a wide following in the north in earlier times, although he was all but forgotten by the 12th century. Saint Serf of Culross was associated with Nechtan&#x27;s brother Bridei. It appears, as is well known in later times, that noble kin groups had their own patron saints, and their own churches or abbeys.

==Art==

Pictish art is primarily associated with monumental stones, but also includes smaller objects of stone and bone, and metalwork such as brooches. It uses a distinctive form of the general Celtic early medieval development of La Tène style with increasing influences from the Insular art of 7th and 8th century Ireland and Northumbria, and then Anglo-Saxon and Irish art as the early medieval period continues. The most well-known surviving examples are the many Pictish stones located across Pictland. 

The symbols and patterns consist of animals including the Pictish Beast, the &quot;rectangle&quot;, the &quot;mirror and comb&quot;, &quot;double-disc and Z-rod&quot; and the &quot;crescent and V-rod&quot;, among many others. There are also bosses and lenses with pelta and spiral designs. The patterns are curvilinear with hatchings. The cross-slabs are carved with Pictish symbols, Insular-derived interlace and Christian imagery, though interpretation is often difficult due to wear and obscurity. Several of the Christian images carved on various stones, such as David the harpist, Daniel and the lion, or scenes of St Paul and St Anthony meeting in the desert, have been influenced by the Insular manuscript tradition.

Pictish metalwork is found throughout Pictland (modern-day Scotland) and also further south; the Picts appeared to have a considerable amount of silver available, probably from raiding further south, or the payment of subsidies to keep them from doing so. The very large hoard of late Roman hacksilver found at Traprain Law may have originated in either way. The largest hoard of early Pictish metalwork was found in 1819 at Norrie&#x27;s Law in Fife, but unfortunately much was dispersed and melted down (Scots law on treasure finds has always been unhelpful to preservation). A famous 7th century silver and enamel plaque from the hoard has a &quot;Z-rod&quot;, one of the Pictish symbols, in a particularly well-preserved and elegant form; unfortunately few comparable pieces have survived. 

Over ten heavy silver chains, some over 0.5m long, have been found from this period; the double-linked Whitecleuch Chain is one of only two that have a penannular linking piece for the ends, with symbol decoration including enamel, which shows how these were probably used as &quot;choker&quot; necklaces.

In the 8th and 9th centuries, after Christianization, the Pictish elite adopted a particular form of the Irish Celtic brooch, preferring true penannular brooches with lobed terminals. Some older Irish brooches were adapted to the Pictish style, for example, the c. 8th century Breadalbane Brooch now in the British Museum. The St Ninian&#x27;s Isle Treasure (c. 750–825 AD) contains the best collection of Pictish forms. Other characteristics of Pictish metalwork are dotted backgrounds or designs and animal forms influenced by Insular art. The 8th century Monymusk Reliquary has elements of Pictish and Irish styles.

==Language==
The Pictish language is extinct. Evidence is limited to place-names, personal names, and contemporary records in other languages. The evidence of place and personal names appears to indicate that the Picts spoke an Insular Celtic language related to the Brittonic languages of the south. It is possible that Pictish diverged significantly from the Southern Neo-Brittonic dialects due to the lack of influence of Latin. The absence of surviving written material in Pictish, discounting the enigmatic Ogham inscriptions, does not indicate a pre-literate society. The church certainly required literacy in Latin, and could not function without copyists to produce liturgical documents. Pictish iconography shows books being read and carried, and its naturalistic style gives every reason to suppose that such images were of real life. Literacy was not widespread, but among the senior clergy, and in monasteries, it would have been common enough. It is likely that the Pictish language influenced the development, grammar and vocabulary of Scottish Gaelic, which has some characteristics unique among the Goidelic languages and which, in certain cases, are more reminiscent of Brittonic languages.

Toponymic evidence indicates the advance of Gaelic into Pictland; Atholl, meaning &quot;New Ireland&quot;, is attested in the early 8th century. This may be an indication of the advance of Gaelic. Fortriu also contains place names suggesting Gaelic settlement, or Gaelic influences. A pre-Gaelic interpretation of the name as &quot;Athfocla&quot; meaning &#x27;north pass&#x27; or &#x27;north way&#x27;, as in gateway to Moray, suggests that the Gaelic &quot;Athfotla&quot; may be a Gaelic misreading of the minuscule c for t.

Ogham inscriptions on Pictish stones and other Pictish archaeological objects survive. These were argued by influential linguist Kenneth Jackson to be unintelligible as Celtic and evidence for the coexistence of a non-Celtic language in Pictish times. Celtic interpretations have since been advanced for some of these inscriptions, but the nature of the inscriptions continues to be a matter of debate.

<text>In mathematics, a permutation group is a group &quot;G&quot; whose elements are permutations of a given set &quot;M&quot; and whose group operation is the composition of permutations in &quot;G&quot; (which are thought of as bijective functions from the set &quot;M&quot; to itself). The group of &quot;all&quot; permutations of a set &quot;M&quot; is the symmetric group of &quot;M&quot;, often written as Sym(&quot;M&quot;). The term &quot;permutation group&quot; thus means a subgroup of the symmetric group. If then Sym(&quot;M&quot;) is usually denoted by S&quot;n&quot;, and may be called the &quot;symmetric group on n letters&quot;.

By Cayley&#x27;s theorem, every group is isomorphic to some permutation group.

The way in which the elements of a permutation group permute the elements of the set is called its group action. Group actions have applications in the study of symmetries, combinatorics and many other branches of mathematics, physics and chemistry.

== Basic properties and terminology ==

A &quot;permutation group&quot; is a subgroup of a symmetric group; that is, its elements are permutations of a given set. It is thus a subset of a symmetric group that is closed under composition of permutations, contains the identity permutation, and contains the inverse permutation of each of its elements. A general property of finite groups implies that a finite nonempty subset of a symmetric group is a permutation group if and only if it is closed under permutation composition.

The degree of a group of permutations of a finite set is the number of elements in the set. The order of a group (of any type) is the number of elements (cardinality) in the group. By Lagrange&#x27;s theorem, the order of any finite permutation group of degree &quot;n&quot; must divide &quot;n&quot;! since &quot;n&quot;-factorial is the order of the symmetric group &quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

==Notation==

Since permutations are bijections of a set, they can be represented by Cauchy&#x27;s &quot;two-line notation&quot;. This notation lists each of the elements of &quot;M&quot; in the first row, and for each element, its image under the permutation below it in the second row. If formula_1 is a permutation of the set formula_2 then,
: formula_3
For instance, a particular permutation of the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} can be written as
: formula_4
this means that &quot;σ&quot; satisfies &quot;σ&quot;(1) = 2, &quot;σ&quot;(2) = 5, &quot;σ&quot;(3) = 4, &quot;σ&quot;(4) = 3, and &quot;σ&quot;(5) = 1. The elements of &quot;M&quot; need not appear in any special order in the first row, so the same permutation could also be written as
: formula_5

Permutations are also often written in cycle notation (&quot;cyclic form&quot;) so that given the set &quot;M&quot; = {1, 2, 3, 4}, a permutation &quot;g&quot; of &quot;M&quot; with &quot;g&quot;(1) = 2, &quot;g&quot;(2) = 4, &quot;g&quot;(4) = 1 and &quot;g&quot;(3) = 3 will be written as (1, 2, 4)(3), or more commonly, (1, 2, 4) since 3 is left unchanged; if the objects are denoted by single letters or digits, commas and spaces can also be dispensed with, and we have a notation such as (124). The permutation written above in 2-line notation would be written in cycle notation as formula_6

==Composition of permutations–the group product==
The product of two permutations is defined as their composition as functions, so formula_7 is the function that maps any element &quot;x&quot; of the set to formula_8. Note that the rightmost permutation is applied to the argument first, because of the way function composition is written. Some authors prefer the leftmost factor acting first, but to that end permutations must be written to the &quot;right&quot; of their argument, often as a superscript, so the permutation formula_1 acting on the element formula_10 results in the image formula_11. With this convention, the product is given by formula_12.

 However, this gives a &quot;different&quot; rule for multiplying permutations. This convention is commonly used in the permutation group literature, but this article uses the convention where the rightmost permutation is applied first.

Since the composition of two bijections always gives another bijection, the product of two permutations is again a permutation. In two-line notation, the product of two permutations is obtained by rearranging the columns of the second (leftmost) permutation so that its first row is identical with the second row of the first (rightmost) permutation. The product can then be written as the first row of the first permutation over the second row of the modified second permutation. For example, given the permutations,
:formula_13
the product &quot;QP&quot; is:
:formula_14

The composition of permutations, when they are written in cycle notation, is obtained by juxtaposing the two permutations (with the second one written on the left) and then simplifying to a disjoint cycle form if desired. Thus, the above product would be given by:
:formula_15

Since function composition is associative, so is the product operation on permutations: formula_16. Therefore, products of two or more permutations are usually written without adding parentheses to express grouping; they are also usually written without a dot or other sign to indicate multiplication (the dots of the previous example were added for emphasis, so would simply be written as formula_17).

==Neutral element and inverses==

The identity permutation, which maps every element of the set to itself, is the neutral element for this product. In two-line notation, the identity is
:formula_18
In cycle notation, &quot;e&quot; = (1)(2)(3)...(&quot;n&quot;) which by convention is also denoted by just (1) or even ().

Since bijections have inverses, so do permutations, and the inverse &quot;σ&quot;−1 of &quot;σ&quot; is again a permutation. Explicitly, whenever &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)=&quot;y&quot; one also has &quot;σ&quot;−1(&quot;y&quot;)=&quot;x&quot;. In two-line notation the inverse can be obtained by interchanging the two lines (and sorting the columns if one wishes the first line to be in a given order). For instance
:formula_19

To obtain the inverse of a single cycle, we reverse the order of its elements. Thus,
:formula_20

To obtain the inverse of a product of cycles, we first reverse the order of the cycles, and then we take the inverse of each as above. Thus,
:formula_21

Having an associative product, an identity element, and inverses for all its elements, makes the set of all permutations of &quot;M&quot; into a group, Sym(&quot;M&quot;); a permutation group.

== Examples ==

Consider the following set &quot;G&quot;1 of permutations of the set &quot;M&quot; = {1, 2, 3, 4}:

* &quot;e&quot; = (1)(2)(3)(4) = (1)
**This is the identity, the trivial permutation which fixes each element.
* &quot;a&quot; = (1 2)(3)(4) = (1 2)
**This permutation interchanges 1 and 2, and fixes 3 and 4.
* &quot;b&quot; = (1)(2)(3 4) = (3 4)
**Like the previous one, but exchanging 3 and 4, and fixing the others.
* &quot;ab&quot; = (1 2)(3 4)
**This permutation, which is the composition of the previous two, exchanges simultaneously 1 with 2, and 3 with 4.

&quot;G&quot;1 forms a group, since &quot;aa&quot; = &quot;bb&quot; = &quot;e&quot;, &quot;ba&quot; = &quot;ab&quot;, and &quot;abab&quot; = &quot;e&quot;. This permutation group is, as an abstract group, the Klein group &quot;V&quot;4.

As another example consider the group of symmetries of a square. Let the vertices of a square be labeled 1, 2, 3 and 4 (counterclockwise around the square starting with 1 in the top left corner). The symmetries are determined by the images of the vertices, that can, in turn, be described by permutations. The rotation by 90° (counterclockwise) about the center of the square is described by the permutation (1234). The 180° and 270° rotations are given by (13)(24) and (1432), respectively. The reflection about the horizontal line through the center is given by (12)(34) and the corresponding vertical line reflection is (14)(23). The reflection about the 1,3−diagonal line is (24) and reflection about the 2,4−diagonal is (13). The only remaining symmetry is the identity (1)(2)(3)(4). This permutation group is known, as an abstract group, as the dihedral group of order 8.

==Group actions==
In the above example of the symmetry group of a square, the permutations &quot;describe&quot; the movement of the vertices of the square induced by the group of symmetries. It is common to say that these group elements are &quot;acting&quot; on the set of vertices of the square. This idea can be made precise by formally defining a group action.

Let &quot;G&quot; be a group and &quot;M&quot; a nonempty set. An action of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;M&quot; is a function &quot;f&quot;: &quot;G&quot; × &quot;M&quot; → &quot;M&quot; such that
* &quot;f&quot;(1, &quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;, for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot; (1 is the identity (neutral) element of the group &quot;G&quot;), and
* &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;h&quot;, &quot;x&quot;)) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;gh&quot;, &quot;x&quot;), for all &quot;g&quot;,&quot;h&quot; in &quot;G&quot; and all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;M&quot;.
This pair of conditions can also be expressed as saying that the action induces a group homomorphism from &quot;G&quot; into &quot;Sym&quot;(&quot;M&quot;). Any such homomorphism is called a &quot;(permutation) representation&quot; of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;M&quot;.

For any permutation group, the action that sends (&quot;g&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) → &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is called the natural action of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;M&quot;. This is the action that is assumed unless otherwise indicated. In the example of the symmetry group of the square, the group&#x27;s action on the set of vertices is the natural action. However, this group also induces an action on the set of four triangles in the square, which are: &quot;t&quot;1 = 234, &quot;t&quot;2 = 134, &quot;t&quot;3 = 124 and &quot;t&quot;4 = 123. It also acts on the two diagonals: &quot;d&quot;1 = 13 and &quot;d&quot;2 = 24.
==Transitive actions==
The action of a group &quot;G&quot; on a set &quot;M&quot; is said to be &quot;transitive&quot; if, for every two elements &quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot; of &quot;M&quot;, there is some group element &quot;g&quot; such that &quot;g&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) = &quot;t&quot;. Equivalently, the set &quot;M&quot; forms a single orbit under the action of &quot;G&quot;. Of the examples above, the group {e, (1 2), (3 4), (1 2)(3 4)} of permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4} is not transitive (no group element takes 1 to 3) but the group of symmetries of a square is transitive on the vertices.

=== Primitive actions ===

A permutation group &quot;G&quot; acting transitively on a non-empty finite set &quot;M&quot; is &quot;imprimitive&quot; if there is some nontrivial set partition of &quot;M&quot; that is preserved by the action of &quot;G&quot;, where &quot;nontrivial&quot; means that the partition isn&#x27;t the partition into singleton sets nor the partition with only one part. Otherwise, if &quot;G&quot; is transitive but does not preserve any nontrivial partition of &quot;M&quot;, the group &quot;G&quot; is &quot;primitive&quot;.

For example, the group of symmetries of a square is imprimitive on the vertices: if they are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 in cyclic order, then the partition into opposite pairs is preserved by every group element. On the other hand, the full symmetric group on a set &quot;M&quot; is always primitive.

==Cayley&#x27;s theorem==
Any group &quot;G&quot; can act on itself (the elements of the group being thought of as the set &quot;M&quot;) in many ways. In particular, there is a regular action given by (left) multiplication in the group. That is, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;x&quot;) = &quot;gx&quot; for all &quot;g&quot; and &quot;x&quot; in &quot;G&quot;. For each fixed &quot;g&quot;, the function &quot;f&quot;&quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;gx&quot; is a bijection on &quot;G&quot; and therefore a permutation of the set of elements of &quot;G&quot;. Each element of &quot;G&quot; can be thought of as a permutation in this way and so &quot;G&quot; is isomorphic to a permutation group; this is the content of Cayley&#x27;s theorem.

For example, consider the group &quot;G&quot;1 acting on the set {1, 2, 3, 4} given above. Let the elements of this group be denoted by &quot;e&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; = &quot;ab&quot; = &quot;ba&quot;. The action of &quot;G&quot;1 on itself described in Cayley&#x27;s theorem gives the following permutation representation:
:&quot;f&quot;&quot;e&quot; ↦ (&quot;e&quot;)(&quot;a&quot;)(&quot;b&quot;)(&quot;c&quot;)
:&quot;f&quot;&quot;a&quot; ↦ (&quot;ea&quot;)(&quot;bc&quot;)
:&quot;f&quot;&quot;b&quot; ↦ (&quot;eb&quot;)(&quot;ac&quot;)
:&quot;f&quot;&quot;c&quot; ↦ (&quot;ec&quot;)(&quot;ab&quot;).

== Isomorphisms of permutation groups ==

If &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are two permutation groups on sets &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; with actions &quot;f&quot;1 and &quot;f&quot;2 respectively, then we say that &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are &quot;permutation isomorphic&quot; (or &quot;isomorphic as permutation groups&quot;) if there exists a bijective map and a group isomorphism such that
: &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;f&quot;1(&quot;g&quot;, &quot;x&quot;)) = &quot;f&quot;2(&quot;ψ&quot;(&quot;g&quot;), &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) for all &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot; and &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;.

If this is equivalent to &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; being conjugate as subgroups of Sym(&quot;X&quot;). The special case where and &quot;ψ&quot; is the identity map gives rise to the concept of &quot;equivalent actions&quot; of a group.

In the example of the symmetries of a square given above, the natural action on the set {1,2,3,4} is equivalent to the action on the triangles. The bijection &quot;λ&quot; between the sets is given by . The natural action of group &quot;G&quot;1 above and its action on itself (via left multiplication) are not equivalent as the natural action has fixed points and the second action does not.

== Oligomorphic groups ==

When a group &quot;G&quot; acts on a set &quot;S&quot;, the action may be extended naturally to the Cartesian product &quot;Sn&quot; of &quot;S&quot;, consisting of &quot;n&quot;-tuples of elements of &quot;S&quot;: the action of an element &quot;g&quot; on the &quot;n&quot;-tuple (&quot;s&quot;1, ..., &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is given by
: &quot;g&quot;(&quot;s&quot;1, ..., &quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;) = (&quot;g&quot;(&quot;s&quot;1), ..., &quot;g&quot;(&quot;s&quot;&quot;n&quot;)).

The group &quot;G&quot; is said to be &quot;oligomorphic&quot; if the action on &quot;Sn&quot; has only finitely many orbits for every positive integer &quot;n&quot;. (This is automatic if &quot;S&quot; is finite, so the term is typically of interest when &quot;S&quot; is infinite.)

The interest in oligomorphic groups is partly based on their application to model theory, for example when considering automorphisms in countably categorical theories.

==History==
The study of groups originally grew out of an understanding of permutation groups. Permutations had themselves been intensively studied by Lagrange in 1770 in his work on the algebraic solutions of polynomial equations. This subject flourished and by the mid 19th century a well-developed theory of permutation groups existed, codified by Camille Jordan in his book &quot;Traité des Substitutions et des Équations Algébriques&quot; of 1870. Jordan&#x27;s book was, in turn, based on the papers that were left by Évariste Galois in 1832.

When Cayley introduced the concept of an abstract group, it was not immediately clear whether or not this was a larger collection of objects than the known permutation groups (which had a definition different from the modern one). Cayley went on to prove that the two concepts were equivalent in Cayley&#x27;s theorem.

Another classical text containing several chapters on permutation groups is Burnside&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Groups of Finite Order&quot; of 1911. The first half of the twentieth century was a fallow period in the study of group theory in general, but interest in permutation groups was revived in the 1950s by H. Wielandt whose German lecture notes were reprinted as &quot;Finite Permutation Groups&quot; in 1964.

<doc id="24635" wikidata="Q58321" url="?curid=24635" title="Protein kinase">
<text>A protein kinase is a kinase which selectively modifies other proteins by covalently adding phosphates to them (phosphorylation) as opposed to kinases which modify lipids, carbohydrates, or other molecules. Phosphorylation usually results in a functional change of the target protein (substrate) by changing enzyme activity, cellular location, or association with other proteins. The human genome contains about 500 protein kinase genes and they constitute about 2% of all human genes. There are two main types of protein kinase. The great majority are serine/threonine kinases, which phosphorylate the hydroxyl groups of serines and threonines in their targets. Most of the others are tyrosine kinases, although additional types exist. Protein kinases are also found in bacteria and plants. Up to 30% of all human proteins may be modified by kinase activity, and kinases are known to regulate the majority of cellular pathways, especially those involved in signal transduction.

==Chemical activity==

The chemical activity of a protein kinase involves removing a phosphate group from ATP and covalently attaching it to one of three amino acids that have a free hydroxyl group. Most kinases act on both serine and threonine, others act on tyrosine, and a number (dual-specificity kinases) act on all three. There are also protein kinases that phosphorylate other amino acids, including histidine kinases that phosphorylate histidine residues.

==Structure==

Eukaryotic protein kinases are enzymes that belong to a very extensive family of proteins that share a conserved catalytic core. The structures of over 280 human protein kinases have been determined.

There are a number of conserved regions in the catalytic domain of protein kinases. In the N-terminal extremity of the catalytic domain there is a glycine-rich stretch of residues in the vicinity of a lysine amino acid, which has been shown to be involved in ATP binding. In the central part of the catalytic domain, there is a conserved aspartic acid, which is important for the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

== Serine/threonine-specific protein kinases ==

Serine/threonine protein kinases () phosphorylate the OH group of serine or threonine (which have similar side chains). Activity of these protein kinases can be regulated by specific events (e.g., DNA damage), as well as numerous chemical signals, including cAMP/cGMP, diacylglycerol, and Ca2+/calmodulin.
One very important group of protein kinases are the MAP kinases (acronym from: &quot;mitogen-activated protein kinases&quot;). Important subgroups are the kinases of the ERK subfamily, typically activated by mitogenic signals, and the stress-activated protein kinases JNK and p38. While MAP kinases are serine/threonine-specific, they are activated by combined phosphorylation on serine/threonine and tyrosine residues. Activity of MAP kinases is restricted by a number of protein phosphatases, which remove the phosphate groups that are added to specific serine or threonine residues of the kinase and are required to maintain the kinase in an active conformation.

== Tyrosine-specific protein kinases ==

Tyrosine-specific protein kinases ( and ) phosphorylate tyrosine amino acid residues, and like serine/threonine-specific kinases are used in signal transduction. They act primarily as growth factor receptors and in downstream signaling from growth factors. Some examples include:
* Platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)
* Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
* Insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R)
* Stem cell factor (SCF) receptor (also called &quot;c-kit&quot;, see the article on gastrointestinal stromal tumor).

=== Receptor tyrosine kinases ===

These kinases consist of extracellular domains, a transmembrane spanning alpha helix, and an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain protruding into the cytoplasm. They play important roles in regulating cell division, cellular differentiation, and morphogenesis. More than 50 receptor tyrosine kinases are known in mammals.

==== Structure ====
The extracellular domains serve as the ligand-binding part of the molecule, often inducing the domains to form homo- or heterodimers. The transmembrane element is a single α helix. The intracellular or cytoplasmic Protein kinase domain is responsible for the (highly conserved) kinase activity, as well as several regulatory functions.

==== Regulation ====
Ligand binding causes two reactions:
# Dimerization of two monomeric receptor kinases or stabilization of a loose dimer. Many ligands of receptor tyrosine kinases are multivalent. Some tyrosine receptor kinases (e.g., the platelet-derived growth factor receptor) can form heterodimers with other similar but not identical kinases of the same subfamily, allowing a highly varied response to the extracellular signal.
# &quot;Trans&quot;-autophosphorylation (phosphorylation by the other kinase in the dimer) of the kinase.

Autophosphorylation stabilizes the active conformation of the kinase domain. When several amino acids suitable for phosphorylation are present in the kinase domain (e.g., the insulin-like growth factor receptor), the activity of the kinase can increase with the number of phosphorylated amino acids; in this case, the first phosphorylation switches the kinase from &quot;off&quot; to &quot;standby&quot;.

==== Signal transduction ====
The active tyrosine kinase phosphorylates specific target proteins, which are often enzymes themselves. An important target is the ras protein signal-transduction chain.

===Receptor-associated tyrosine kinases===

Tyrosine kinases recruited to a receptor following hormone binding are receptor-associated tyrosine kinases and are involved in a number of signaling cascades, in particular those involved in cytokine signaling (but also others, including growth hormone). One such receptor-associated tyrosine kinase is Janus kinase (JAK), many of whose effects are mediated by STAT proteins. (&quot;See JAK-STAT pathway.&quot;)

==Dual-specificity protein kinases==

Some kinases have dual-specificity kinase activities. For example, MEK (MAPKK), which is involved in the MAP kinase cascade, is a both a serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase.

==Histidine-specific protein kinases==
Histidine kinases are structurally distinct from most other protein kinases and are found mostly in prokaryotes as part of two-component signal transduction mechanisms. A phosphate group from ATP is first added to a histidine residue within the kinase, and later transferred to an aspartate residue on a &#x27;receiver domain&#x27; on a different protein, or sometimes on the kinase itself. The aspartyl phosphate residue is then active in signaling.

Histidine kinases are found widely in prokaryotes, as well as in plants, fungi and eukaryotes. The pyruvate dehydrogenase family of kinases in animals is structurally related to histidine kinases, but instead phosphorylate serine residues, and probably do not use a phospho-histidine intermediate.

==Aspartic acid/glutamic acid-specific protein kinases==
==Inhibitors==

Deregulated kinase activity is a frequent cause of disease, in particular cancer, wherein kinases regulate many aspects that control cell growth, movement and death. Drugs that inhibit specific kinases are being developed to treat several diseases, and some are currently in clinical use, including Gleevec (imatinib) and Iressa (gefitinib).
* Anthra(1,9-cd)pyrazol-6(2H)-one
* Staurosporine

==Kinase assays and profiling==
Drug developments for kinase inhibitors are started from kinase assays , the lead compounds are usually profiled for specificity before moving into further tests. Many profiling services are available from fluorescent-based assays to radioisotope based detections, and competition binding assays.

<doc id="24636" wikidata="Q13375" url="?curid=24636" title="Pisa">
<text>Pisa ( ; ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in Tuscany, central Italy, straddling the Arno just before it empties into the Ligurian Sea. It is the capital city of the Province of Pisa. Although Pisa is known worldwide for its leaning tower, the city contains more than twenty other historic churches, several medieval palaces, and bridges across the Arno. Much of the city&#x27;s architecture was financed from its history as one of the Italian maritime republics.

The city is also home to the University of Pisa, which has a history going back to the 12th century, the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, founded by Napoleon in 1810, and its offshoot, the Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;gradscuola/&quot;&gt;Scuola Superiore Sant&#x27;Anna di Pisa Information statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Ancient times===

Most believe the hypothesis that the origin of the name Pisa comes from Etruscan and means &#x27;mouth&#x27;, as Pisa is at the mouth of the Arno river.

Although throughout history there have been several uncertainties about the origin of the city of Pisa, excavations made in the 1980s and 1990s found numerous archaeological remains, including the fifth century BC tomb of an Etruscan prince, proving the Etruscan origin of the city, and its role as a maritime city, showing that it also maintained trade relations with other Mediterranean civilizations.

Ancient Roman authors referred to Pisa as an old city. Virgil, in his &quot;Aeneid&quot;, states that Pisa was already a great center by the times described; and gives the epithet of &quot;Alphēae&quot; to the city because it was said to have been founded by colonists from Pisa in Elis, near which the Alpheius river flowed. The Virgilian commentator Servius wrote that the Teuti founded the town 13 centuries before the start of the common era.

The maritime role of Pisa should have been already prominent if the ancient authorities ascribed to it the invention of the naval ram. Pisa took advantage of being the only port along the western coast between Genoa (then a small village) and Ostia. Pisa served as a base for Roman naval expeditions against Ligurians and Gauls. In 180 BC, it became a Roman colony under Roman law, as . In 89 BC, became a &quot;municipium&quot;. Emperor Augustus fortified the colony into an important port and changed the name to .

Pisa supposedly was founded on the shore, but due to the alluvial sediments from the Arno and the Serchio, whose mouth lies about north of the Arno&#x27;s, the shore moved west. Strabo states that the city was away from the coast. Currently, it is located from the coast. However, it was a maritime city, with ships sailing up the Arno. In the 90s AD, a baths complex was built in the city.

===Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages===

During the last years of the Western Roman Empire, Pisa did not decline as much as the other cities of Italy, probably due to the complexity of its river system and its consequent ease of defence. In the seventh century, Pisa helped Pope Gregory I by supplying numerous ships in his military expedition against the Byzantines of Ravenna (what &quot;military expedition by Pope Gregory against the Byzantine Empire&quot;): Pisa was the sole Byzantine centre of Tuscia to fall peacefully in Lombard hands, through assimilation with the neighbouring region where their trading interests were prevalent. Pisa began in this way its rise to the role of main port of the Upper Tyrrhenian Sea and became the main trading centre between Tuscany and Corsica, Sardinia, and the southern coasts of France and Spain.

After Charlemagne had defeated the Lombards under the command of Desiderius in 774, Pisa went through a crisis, but soon recovered. Politically, it became part of the duchy of Lucca. In 860, Pisa was captured by vikings led by Björn Ironside. In 930, Pisa became the county centre (status it maintained until the arrival of Otto I) within the mark of Tuscia. Lucca was the capital but Pisa was the most important city, as in the middle of tenth century Liutprand of Cremona, bishop of Cremona, called Pisa (&quot;capital of the province of Tuscia&quot;), and a century later, the marquis of Tuscia was commonly referred to as &quot;marquis of Pisa&quot;. In 1003, Pisa was the protagonist of the first communal war in Italy, against Lucca. From the naval point of view, since the ninth century, the emergence of the Saracen pirates prompted the city to expand its fleet. In the following years, this fleet gave the town an opportunity for more expansion. In 828, Pisan ships assaulted the coast of North Africa. In 871, they took part in the defence of Salerno from the Saracens. In 970, they gave also strong support to Otto I&#x27;s expedition, defeating a Byzantine fleet in front of Calabrese coasts.

===11th century===
The power of Pisa as a maritime nation began to grow and reached its apex in the 11th century, when it acquired traditional fame as one of the four main historical maritime republics of Italy ().

At that time, the city was a very important commercial centre and controlled a significant Mediterranean merchant fleet and navy. It expanded its powers in 1005 through the sack of in the south of Italy. Pisa was in continuous conflict with some &#x27;Saracens&#x27; - a medieval term to refer to Arab Muslims - who had their bases in Corsica, for control of the Mediterranean. In 1017, Sardinian Giudicati were militarily supported by Pisa, in alliance with Genoa, to defeat the Saracen King Mugahid, who had settled a logistic base in the north of Sardinia the year before. This victory gave Pisa supremacy in the Tyrrhenian Sea. When the Pisans subsequently ousted the Genoese from Sardinia, a new conflict and rivalry was born between these major marine republics. Between 1030 and 1035, Pisa went on to defeat several rival towns in Sicily and conquer Carthage in North Africa. In 1051–1052, the admiral Jacopo Ciurini conquered Corsica, provoking more resentment from the Genoese. In 1063, Admiral Giovanni Orlandi, coming to the aid of the Norman Roger I, took Palermo from the Saracen pirates. The gold treasure taken from the Saracens in Palermo allowed the Pisans to start the building of their cathedral and the other monuments which constitute the famous .

In 1060, Pisa engaged in its first battle with Genoa. The Pisan victory helped to consolidate its position in the Mediterranean. Pope Gregory VII recognised in 1077 the new &quot;Laws and customs of the sea&quot; instituted by the Pisans, and emperor Henry IV granted them the right to name their own consuls, advised by a council of elders. This was simply a confirmation of the present situation, because in those years, the marquis had already been excluded from power. In 1092, Pope Urban II awarded Pisa the supremacy over Corsica and Sardinia, and at the same time raising the town to the rank of archbishopric.

Pisa sacked the Tunisian city of Mahdia in 1088. Four years later, Pisan and Genoese ships helped Alfonso VI of Castilla to push El Cid out of Valencia. A Pisan fleet of 120 ships also took part in the First Crusade, and the Pisans were instrumental in the taking of Jerusalem in 1099. On their way to the Holy Land, the ships did not miss the occasion to sack some Byzantine islands; the Pisan crusaders were led by their archbishop Daibert, the future patriarch of Jerusalem. Pisa and the other took advantage of the crusade to establish trading posts and colonies in the Eastern coastal cities of the Levant. In particular, the Pisans founded colonies in Antiochia, Acre, Jaffa, Tripoli, Tyre, Latakia, and Accone. They also had other possessions in Jerusalem and Caesarea, plus smaller colonies (with lesser autonomy) in Cairo, Alexandria, and of course Constantinople, where the Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus granted them special mooring and trading rights. In all these cities, the Pisans were granted privileges and immunity from taxation, but had to contribute to the defence in case of attack. In the 12th century, the Pisan quarter in the eastern part of Constantinople had grown to 1,000 people. For some years of that century, Pisa was the most prominent commercial and military ally of the Byzantine Empire, overcoming Venice itself.

===12th century===
In 1113, Pisa and Pope Paschal II set up, together with the count of Barcelona and other contingents from Provence and Italy (Genoese excluded), a war to free the Balearic Islands from the Moors; the queen and the king of Majorca were brought in chains to Tuscany. Though the Almoravides soon reconquered the island, the booty taken helped the Pisans in their magnificent programme of buildings, especially the cathedral, and Pisa gained a role of pre-eminence in the Western Mediterranean.

In the following years, the powerful Pisan fleet, led by archbishop Pietro Moriconi, drove away the Saracens after ferocious battles. Though short-lived, this Pisan success in Spain increased the rivalry with Genoa. Pisa&#x27;s trade with Languedoc, Provence (Noli, Savona, Fréjus, and Montpellier) were an obstacle to Genoese interests in cities such as Hyères, Fos, Antibes, and Marseille.

The war began in 1119 when the Genoese attacked several galleys on their way home to the motherland, and lasted until 1133. The two cities fought each other on land and at sea, but hostilities were limited to raids and pirate-like assaults.

In June 1135, Bernard of Clairvaux took a leading part in the Council of Pisa, asserting the claims of Pope Innocent II against those of Pope Anacletus II, who had been elected pope in 1130 with Norman support, but was not recognised outside Rome. Innocent II resolved the conflict with Genoa, establishing Pisan and Genoese spheres of influence. Pisa could then, unhindered by Genoa, participate in the conflict of Innocent II against king Roger II of Sicily. Amalfi, one of the maritime republics (though already declining under Norman rule), was conquered on August 6, 1136; the Pisans destroyed the ships in the port, assaulted the castles in the surrounding areas, and drove back an army sent by Roger from Aversa. This victory brought Pisa to the peak of its power and to a standing equal to Venice. Two years later, its soldiers sacked Salerno.

In the following years, Pisa was one of the staunchest supporters of the Ghibelline party. This was much appreciated by Frederick I. He issued in 1162 and 1165 two important documents, with these grants: Apart from the jurisdiction over the Pisan countryside, the Pisans were granted freedom of trade in the whole empire, the coast from Civitavecchia to Portovenere, a half of Palermo, Messina, Salerno and Naples, the whole of Gaeta, Mazara, and Trapani, and a street with houses for its merchants in every city of the Kingdom of Sicily. Some of these grants were later confirmed by Henry VI, Otto IV, and Frederick II. They marked the apex of Pisa&#x27;s power, but also spurred the resentment of other cities such as Lucca, Massa, Volterra, and Florence, thwarting their aim to expand towards the sea. The clash with Lucca also concerned the possession of the castle of Montignoso and mainly the control of the , the main trade route between Rome and France. Last, but not least, such a sudden and large increase of power by Pisa could only lead to another war with Genoa.

Genoa had acquired a dominant position in the markets of southern France. The war began in 1165 on the Rhône, when an attack on a convoy, directed to some Pisan trade centres on the river, by the Genoese and their ally, the count of Toulouse, failed. Pisa, though, was allied to Provence. The war continued until 1175 without significant victories. Another point of attrition was Sicily, where both the cities had privileges granted by Henry VI. In 1192, Pisa managed to conquer Messina. This episode was followed by a series of battles culminating in the Genoese conquest of Syracuse in 1204. Later, the trading posts in Sicily were lost when the new Pope Innocent III, though removing the excommunication cast over Pisa by his predecessor Celestine III, allied himself with the Guelph League of Tuscany, led by Florence. Soon, he stipulated a pact with Genoa, too, further weakening the Pisan presence in southern Italy.

To counter the Genoese predominance in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea, Pisa strengthened its relationship with its traditional Spanish and French bases (Marseille, Narbonne, Barcelona, etc.) and tried to defy the Venetian rule of the Adriatic Sea. In 1180, the two cities agreed to a nonaggression treaty in the Tyrrhenian and the Adriatic, but the death of Emperor Manuel Comnenus in Constantinople changed the situation. Soon, attacks on Venetian convoys were made. Pisa signed trade and political pacts with Ancona, Pula, Zara, Split, and Brindisi; in 1195, a Pisan fleet reached Pola to defend its independence from Venice, but the Serenissima soon reconquered the rebel sea town.

One year later, the two cities signed a peace treaty, which resulted in favourable conditions for Pisa, but in 1199, the Pisans violated it by blockading the port of Brindisi in Apulia. In the following naval battle, they were defeated by the Venetians. The war that followed ended in 1206 with a treaty in which Pisa gave up all its hopes to expand in the Adriatic, though it maintained the trading posts it had established in the area. From that point on, the two cities were united against the rising power of Genoa and sometimes collaborated to increase the trading benefits in Constantinople.

===13th century===
In 1209 in Lerici, two councils for a final resolution of the rivalry with Genoa were held. A 20-year peace treaty was signed, but when in 1220, the emperor Frederick II confirmed his supremacy over the Tyrrhenian coast from Civitavecchia to Portovenere, the Genoese and Tuscan resentment against Pisa grew again. In the following years, Pisa clashed with Lucca in Garfagnana and was defeated by the Florentines at Castel del Bosco. The strong Ghibelline position of Pisa brought this town diametrically against the Pope, who was in a dispute with the Holy Roman Empire, and indeed the pope tried to deprive Pisa of its dominions in northern Sardinia.

In 1238, Pope Gregory IX formed an alliance between Genoa and Venice against the empire, and consequently against Pisa, too. One year later, he excommunicated Frederick II and called for an anti-Empire council to be held in Rome in 1241. On May 3, 1241, a combined fleet of Pisan and Sicilian ships, led by the emperor&#x27;s son Enzo, attacked a Genoese convoy carrying prelates from northern Italy and France, next to the isle of Giglio (Battle of Giglio), in front of Tuscany; the Genoese lost 25 ships, while about a thousand sailors, two cardinals, and one bishop were taken prisoner. After this major victory, the council in Rome failed, but Pisa was excommunicated. This extreme measure was only removed in 1257. Anyway, the Tuscan city tried to take advantage of the favourable situation to conquer the Corsican city of Aleria and even lay siege to Genoa itself in 1243.

The Ligurian republic of Genoa, however, recovered fast from this blow and won back Lerici, conquered by the Pisans some years earlier, in 1256.

The great expansion in the Mediterranean and the prominence of the merchant class urged a modification in the city&#x27;s institutes. The system with consuls was abandoned, and in 1230, the new city rulers named a &quot;capitano del popolo&quot; (&quot;people&#x27;s chieftain&quot;) as civil and military leader. Despite these reforms, the conquered lands and the city itself were harassed by the rivalry between the two families of Della Gherardesca and Visconti. In 1237 the archbishop and the Emperor Frederick II intervened to reconcile the two rivals, but the strains continued. In 1254, the people rebelled and imposed 12 (&quot;People&#x27;s Elders&quot;) as their political representatives in the commune. They also supplemented the legislative councils, formed of noblemen, with new People&#x27;s Councils, composed by the main guilds and by the chiefs of the People&#x27;s Companies. These had the power to ratify the laws of the Major General Council and the Senate.

===Decline===

The decline is said to have begun on August 6, 1284, when the numerically superior fleet of Pisa, under the command of Albertino Morosini, was defeated by the brilliant tactics of the Genoese fleet, under the command of Benedetto Zaccaria and Oberto Doria, in the dramatic naval Battle of Meloria. This defeat ended the maritime power of Pisa and the town never fully recovered; in 1290, the Genoese destroyed forever the Porto Pisano (Pisa&#x27;s port), and covered the land with salt. The region around Pisa did not permit the city to recover from the loss of thousands of sailors from the Meloria, while Liguria guaranteed enough sailors to Genoa. Goods, however, continued to be traded, albeit in reduced quantity, but the end came when the Arno started to change course, preventing the galleys from reaching the city&#x27;s port up the river. The nearby area also likely became infested with malaria. The true end came in 1324, when Sardinia was entirely lost to the Aragonese.

Always Ghibelline, Pisa tried to build up its power in the course of the 14th century, and even managed to defeat Florence in the Battle of Montecatini (1315), under the command of Uguccione della Faggiuola. Eventually, however, after a long siege, Pisa was occupied by Florentines in 1405. Florentines corrupted the &quot;capitano del popolo&quot; (&quot;people&#x27;s chieftain&quot;), Giovanni Gambacorta, who at night opened the city gate of San Marco. Pisa was never conquered by an army. In 1409, Pisa was the seat of a council trying to set the question of the Great Schism. In the 15th century, access to the sea became more difficult, as the port was silting up and was cut off from the sea. When in 1494, Charles VIII of France invaded the Italian states to claim the Kingdom of Naples, Pisa reclaimed its independence as the Second Pisan Republic.

The new freedom did not last long; 15 years of battles and sieges by the Florentine troops led by Antonio da Filicaja, Averardo Salviati and Niccolò Capponi were made, but they failed to conquer the city. Vitellozzo Vitelli with his brother Paolo were the only ones who actually managed to break the strong defences of Pisa and make a breach in the Stampace bastion in the southern west part of the walls, but he did not enter the city. For that, they were suspected of treachery and Paolo was put to death. However, the resources of Pisa were getting low, and at the end, the city was sold to the Visconti family from Milan and eventually to Florence again. Livorno took over the role of the main port of Tuscany. Pisa acquired a mainly cultural role spurred by the presence of the University of Pisa, created in 1343, and later reinforced by the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa (1810) and Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies (1987).

Pisa was the birthplace of the important early physicist Galileo Galilei. It is still the seat of an archbishopric. Besides its educational institutions, it has become a light industrial centre and a railway hub. It suffered repeated destruction during World War II.

Since the early 1950s, the US Army has maintained Camp Darby just outside Pisa, which is used by many US military personnel as a base for vacations in the area.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Pisa has a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfa&quot;) and Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;). The city is characterized by cool to mild winters and hot summers. This transitional climate allows Pisa to have summers with moderate rainfall. Rainfall peaks in autumn. Snow is rare. The highest officially recorded temperature was on 22 August 2011 and the lowest was on 12 January 1985.

==Culture==
===&quot;Gioco del Ponte&quot;===
In Pisa there was a festival and game &quot;:fr:Gioco del Ponte&quot; (Game of the Bridge) which was celebrated (in some form) in Pisa from perhaps the 1200s down to 1807. From the end of the 1400s the game took the form of a mock battle fought upon Pisa&#x27;s central bridge (&quot;Ponte di Mezzo&quot;). The participants wore quilted armor and the only offensive weapon allowed was the &quot;targone&quot;, a shield-shaped, stout board with precisely specified dimensions. Hitting below the belt was not allowed. Two opposing teams started at opposite ends of the bridge. The object of the two opposing teams was to penetrate, drive back, and disperse the opponents&#x27; ranks and to thereby drive them backwards off the bridge. The struggle was limited to forty-five minutes. Victory or defeat was immensely important to the team players and their partisans, but sometimes the game was fought to a draw and both sides celebrated.

In 1677 the battle was witnessed by Dutch travelling artist Cornelis de Bruijn. He wrote:

&quot;While I stayed in Livorno, I went to Pisa to witness the bridge fight there. The fighters arrived fully armored, wearing helmets, each carrying their banner, which was planted at both ends of the bridge, which is quite wide and long. The battle is fought with certain wooden implements made for this purpose, which they wear over their arms and are attached to them, with which they pummel each other so intensely that I saw several of them carried away with bloody and crushed heads. Victory consists of capturing the bridge, in the same way as the fistfights in Venice between the it:Castellani and the Nicolotti.&quot;

In 1927 the tradition was revived by college students as an elaborate costume parade. In 1935 Vittorio Emanuele III with the royal family witnessed the first revival of a modern version of the game, which has been pursued in the 20th and 21st centuries with some interruptions and varying degrees of enthusiasm by Pisans and their civic institutions.

<doc id="24637" wikidata="Q668011" url="?curid=24637" title="Pentium FDIV bug">
<text>The Pentium FDIV bug is a hardware bug affecting the floating-point unit (FPU) of the early Intel Pentium processors. Because of the bug, the processor would return incorrect binary floating point results when dividing certain pairs of high-precision numbers. The bug was discovered in 1994 by Thomas R. Nicely, a professor of mathematics at Lynchburg College. Missing values in a lookup table used by the FPU&#x27;s floating-point division algorithm led to calculations acquiring small errors. While these errors would in most use-cases only occur rarely and result in small deviations from the correct output values, in certain circumstances the errors can occur frequently and lead to more significant deviations.

The severity of the FDIV bug is debated. Though rarely encountered by most users (&quot;Byte&quot; magazine estimated that 1 in 9 billion floating point divides with random parameters would produce inaccurate results), both the flaw and Intel&#x27;s initial handling of the matter were heavily criticized by the tech community. 

In December 1994, Intel recalled the defective processors in what was the first full recall of a computer chip. In its 1994 annual report, Intel said it incurred &quot;a $475 million pre-tax charge ... to recover replacement and write-off of these microprocessors.&quot;

==Description==

In order to improve the speed of floating-point division calculations on the Pentium chip over the 486DX, Intel opted to replace the shift-and-subtract division algorithm with the Sweeney, Robertson, and Tocher (SRT) algorithm. The SRT algorithm can generate two bits of the division result per clock cycle, whereas the 486&#x27;s algorithm could only generate one. It is implemented using a programmable logic array with 2,048 cells, of which 1,066 cells should have been populated with one of five values: . When the original array for the Pentium was compiled, five values were not correctly sent to the equipment that etches the arrays into the chips – thus five of the array cells contained zero when they should have contained +2.

As a result, calculations that rely on these five cells acquire errors; these errors can accumulate repeatedly owing to the recursive nature of the SRT algorithm. In pathological cases the error can reach the fourth significant digit of the result, although this is rare. The error is usually confined to the ninth or tenth significant digit.

Only certain combinations of numerator and denominator trigger the bug. One commonly-reported example is dividing 4,195,835 by 3,145,727. Performing this calculation in any software that used the floating-point coprocessor, such as Windows Calculator, would allow users to discover whether their Pentium chip was affected.

The correct value of the calculation is:

When converted to the hexadecimal value used by the processor, 4,195,835 = 0x4005FB and 3,145,727 = 0x2FFFFF. The &quot;5&quot; in 0x4005FB triggers the access to the &quot;empty&quot; array cells. As a result, the value returned by a flawed Pentium processor is incorrect at or beyond four digits:

&lt;/math&gt;}}

which is actually the value of formula_1.

==Discovery and response==
Thomas Nicely, a professor of mathematics at Lynchburg College, had written code to enumerate primes, twin primes, prime triplets, and prime quadruplets. Nicely noticed some inconsistencies in the calculations on June 13, 1994, shortly after adding a Pentium system to his group of computers, but was unable to eliminate other factors (such as programming errors, motherboard chipsets, etc.) until October 19, 1994. On October 24, 1994, he reported the issue to Intel. Intel had reportedly become aware of the issue independently by June 1994, and had begun fixing it at this point, but chose not to publicly disclose any details or recall affected CPUs.

On October 30, 1994, Nicely sent an email describing the bug to various academic contacts, requesting reports of testing for the flaw on 486-DX4s, Pentiums and Pentium clones. The bug was quickly verified by others, and news of it spread quickly on the Internet. The bug acquired the name &quot;Pentium FDIV bug&quot; from the x86 assembly language mnemonic for floating-point division, the most frequently used instruction affected.

The story first appeared in the press on November 7, 1994, in an article in &quot;Electronic Engineering Times&quot;, &quot;Intel fixes a Pentium FPU glitch&quot; by Alexander Wolfe, and was subsequently picked up by CNN in a segment aired on November 22. It was also reported on by the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, making the front page in the latter.

At this point, Intel acknowledged the floating-point flaw, but claimed that it was not serious and would not affect most users. Intel offered to replace processors to users who could prove that they were affected. However, although most independent estimates found that the bug would have a very limited impact on most users, it caused significant negative press for the company. During a 2019 talk, while reflecting on development of &quot;Quake&quot;, John Romero described how frequently and persistently this bug could be reproduced by Michael Abrash. Abrash spent hours tracking down exact conditions needed to produce the bug, which would result in parts of a game level appearing unexpectedly when viewed from certain camera angles. IBM paused the sale of PCs containing Intel CPUs, and Intel&#x27;s stock price decreased significantly. The motive behind IBM&#x27;s decision was questioned by some in the industry; IBM produced the PowerPC CPUs at the time, and potentially stood to benefit from any reputational damage to the Pentium or Intel as a company. However, the decision led to corporate buyers of PC equipment demanding replacements of existing Pentium CPUs, and soon afterwards other PC manufacturers began offering &quot;no questions asked&quot; replacements of flawed Pentium chips.

The growing dissatisfaction with Intel&#x27;s response led to the company offering to replace all flawed Pentium processors on request on December 20. On January 17, 1995, Intel announced a pre-tax charge of $475 million against earnings, ostensibly the total cost associated with replacement of the flawed processors. This is equivalent to $ in . Intel was criticised for barring resellers and OEMs from participating in the recall program, requiring end-users to replace chips themselves. Intel&#x27;s justification for this, posted on its support web page, was that &quot;it is the individual decision of the end user to determine if the flaw is affecting their application accuracy&quot;.

A 1995 article in &quot;Science&quot; describes the value of number theory problems in discovering computer bugs and gives the mathematical background and history of Brun&#x27;s constant, the problem Nicely was working on when he discovered the bug.

Intel&#x27;s response to the FDIV bug has been cited as a case of the public relations impact of a problem eclipsing the practical impact of said problem on customers. While most users were unlikely to encounter the flaw in their day-to-day computing, the company&#x27;s initial reaction to not replace chips unless customers could guarantee they were affected caused pushback from a vocal minority of industry experts. The subsequent publicity generated shook consumer confidence in the CPUs, and led to a demand for action even from people unlikely to be affected by the issue. Andy Grove, Intel&#x27;s CEO at the time was quoted in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; as saying &quot;I think the kernel of the issue we missed ... was that we presumed to tell somebody what they should or shouldn&#x27;t worry about, or should or shouldn&#x27;t do&quot;.

In the aftermath of the bug and subsequent recall, there was a marked increase in the use of formal verification of hardware floating point operations across the semiconductor industry. Prompted by the discovery of the bug, a technique applicable to the SRT algorithm called &quot;word-level model checking&quot; was developed in 1996. Intel went on to use formal verification extensively in the development of later CPU architectures. In the development of the Pentium 4, symbolic trajectory evaluation and theorem proving were used to find a number of bugs that could have led to a similar recall incident had they gone undetected. The first Intel microarchitecture to use formal verification as the primary method of validation was Nehalem, developed in 2008.

==Affected models==
The FDIV bug affects the 60 and 66 MHz Pentium P5 800 in stepping levels prior to D1, and the 75, 90, and 100 MHz Pentium P54C 600 in steppings prior to B5. The 120 MHz P54C and P54CQS CPUs are unaffected.

== Software patches ==
Various software patches were produced by manufacturers to work around the bug. One specific algorithm, outlined in a paper in &quot;IEEE Computational Science &amp; Engineering&quot;, is to check for divisors that can trigger the access to the programmable logic array cells that erroneously contain zero, and if found, multiply both numerator and denominator by 15/16. This takes them out of the &#x27;buggy&#x27; range. This fix does carry a measurable speed penalty - worst case for a program doing nothing but FDIV operations with bad divisors the running time would double since each FDIV would take about 80 instead of 40 clock cycles. With more random divisors the average time per FDIV was approximately 50 clock cycles, i.e. 10 cycles added to check the divisor: Only 5 out of 1024 random divisors would trigger the scaling fixup. Since FDIV is a rare operation in most programs, the normal slowdown with the fix installed was typically a percent or less.

The main challenge faced by software companies was implementing the fix in pre-existing software, much of which relied on libraries outside their control. Some companies, such as Wolfram Research, opted to directly patch the machine code of existing executables to replace the FDIV opcode with an illegal instruction. This would then trigger an exception that an exception handler (also patched in) would catch. From here, arbitrary code could be executed to work around the bug.

Microsoft offered operating system level workarounds in versions of Windows up to Windows XP. Utilities were included with the operating system to check for the presence of the bug and disable the FPU if found.

<doc id="24638" wikidata="Q133163" url="?curid=24638" title="Percussion instrument">
<text>A percussion instrument is a musical instrument that is sounded by being struck or scraped by a beater including attached or enclosed beaters or rattles struck, scraped or rubbed by hand or struck against another similar instrument. Excluding zoomusicological instruments and the human voice, the percussion family is believed to include the oldest musical instruments. In spite of being a very common term to designate instruments, and to relate them to their players, the percussionists, percussion is not a systematic classificatory category of instruments, as described by the scientific field of organology. It is shown below that percussion instruments may belong to the organological classes of idiophone, membranophone, aerophone and chordophone.

The percussion section of an orchestra most commonly contains instruments such as the timpani, snare drum, bass drum, tambourine, belonging to the membranophones, and cymbals and triangle, which are idiophones. However, the section can &quot;also&quot; contain aerophones, such as whistles and sirens, or a blown conch shell. Percussive techniques can even be applied to the human body itself, as in body percussion. On the other hand, keyboard instruments, such as the celesta, are not normally part of the percussion section, but keyboard percussion instruments such as the glockenspiel and xylophone (which do not have piano keyboards) are included.

== Function ==
Percussion instruments may play not only rhythm, but also melody and harmony.

Percussion is commonly referred to as &quot;the backbone&quot; or &quot;the heartbeat&quot; of a musical ensemble, often working in close collaboration with bass instruments, when present. In jazz and other popular music ensembles, the pianist, bassist, drummer and sometimes the guitarist are referred to as the rhythm section. Most classical pieces written for full orchestra since the time of Haydn and Mozart are orchestrated to place emphasis on the strings, woodwinds, and brass. However, often at least one pair of timpani is included, though they rarely play continuously. Rather, they serve to provide additional accents when needed. In the 18th and 19th centuries, other percussion instruments (like the triangle or cymbals) have been used, again generally sparingly. The use of percussion instruments became more frequent in the 20th century classical music.

In almost every style of music, percussion plays a pivotal role. In military marching bands and pipes and drums, it is the beat of the bass drum that keeps the soldiers in step and at a regular speed, and it is the snare that provides that crisp, decisive air to the tune of a regiment. In classic jazz, one almost immediately thinks of the distinctive rhythm of the hi-hats or the ride cymbal when the word-swing is spoken. In more recent popular-music culture, it is almost impossible to name three or four rock, hip-hop, rap, funk or even soul charts or songs that do not have some sort of percussive beat keeping the tune in time.

Because of the diversity of percussive instruments, it is not uncommon to find large musical ensembles composed entirely of percussion. Rhythm, melody, and harmony are all represented in these ensembles.

==Percussion notation==
Music for pitched percussion instruments can be notated on a staff with the same treble and bass clefs used by many non-percussive instruments. Music for percussive instruments without a definite pitch can be notated with a specialist rhythm or percussion-clef. The guitar also has a special &quot;tab&quot; staff. More often a bass clef is substituted for rhythm clef.

==Classification==

Percussion instruments are classified by various criteria sometimes depending on their construction, ethnic origin, function within musical theory and orchestration, or their relative prevalence in common knowledge.

The word percussion derives from the Latin verb &quot;percussio&quot; to beat, strike in the musical sense, and the noun &quot;percussus&quot;, a beating. As a noun in contemporary English, Wiktionary describes it as the collision of two bodies to produce a sound. The term is not unique to music, but has application in medicine and weaponry, as in percussion cap. However, all known uses of &quot;percussion&quot; appear to share a similar lineage beginning with the original Latin percussus. In a musical context then, the &quot;percussion instruments&quot; may have been originally coined to describe a family of musical instruments including drums, rattles, metal plates, or blocks that musicians beat or struck to produce sound.

The Hornbostel–Sachs system has no high-level section for &quot;percussion&quot;. Most percussion instruments as the term is normally understood are classified as idiophones and membranophones. However the term &quot;percussion&quot; is instead used at lower-levels of the Hornbostel–Sachs hierarchy, including to identify instruments struck with either a non sonorous object hand, stick, striker or against a non-sonorous object human body, the ground. This is opposed to &quot;concussion&quot;, which refers to instruments with two or more complementary sonorous parts that strike against each other and other meanings. For example:

111.1 &quot;Concussion idiophones or clappers&quot;, played in pairs and beaten against each other, such as zills and clapsticks.

111.2 &quot;Percussion idiophones&quot;, includes many percussion instruments played with the hand or by a percussion mallet, such as the hang, gongs and the xylophone, but not drums and only some cymbals.

21 &quot;Struck drums&quot;, includes most types of drum, such as the timpani, snare drum, and tom-tom.

412.12 &quot;Percussion reeds&quot;, a class of wind instrument unrelated to &quot;percussion&quot; in the more common sense 
There are many instruments that have some claim to being percussion, but are classified otherwise:
* Keyboard instruments such as the celesta and piano.
* Stringed instruments played with beaters such as the hammered dulcimer.
* Unpitched whistles and similar instruments, such as the pea whistle and Acme siren.
Percussion instruments are sometimes classified as pitched or unpitched. While valid, this classification is widely seen as inadequate. Rather, it may be more informative to describe percussion instruments in regards to one or more of the following four paradigms:

===By methods of sound production===

Many texts, including &quot;Teaching Percussion&quot; by Gary Cook of the University of Arizona, begin by studying the physical characteristics of instruments and the methods by which they can produce sound. This is perhaps the most scientifically pleasing assignment of nomenclature whereas the other paradigms are more dependent on historical or social circumstances. Based on observation and experimentation, one can determine how an instrument produces sound and then assign the instrument to one of the following four categories:

====Idiophone====

&quot;Idiophones produce sounds through the vibration of their entire body.&quot; Examples of idiophones:

* Bells
* Bock-a-da-bock
* Cabasa
* Cajón
* Castanets
* Celesta
* Chimes
* Claves
* Cowbell
* Crash cymbals
* Crotales
* Daxophone
* Flexatone
* Glockenspiel
* Güiro
* Handbells
* Hi-hat
* Lummi stick
* Maraca
* Marimba
* Orchestra bells
* Quadrangularis Reversum
* Ratchet
* Singing bowls
* Slit drum
* Steelpan
* Suspended cymbal
* Temple blocks
* Thumb piano (or Kalimba)
* Triangle
* Txalaparta
* Vibraphone
* Vibraslap
* Wood block
* Xylophone
====Membranophone====
Most objects commonly known as drums are membranophones. Membranophones produce sound when the membrane or head is struck with a hand, mallet, stick, beater, or improvised tool.

Examples of membranophones:

*Bass drum
*Bongos
*Conga
*Darbuka
*Djembe
*Kuzeh
*Mridangam
*Octoban
*Parai
*Rototom
*Snare drum
*Tabla
*Thavil
*Timpani
*Tom-tom
*Lion&#x27;s roar
*Urumi
*Wind machine

====Chordophone====
Most instruments known as chordophones are defined as string instruments, wherein their sound is derived from the vibration of a string, but some such as these examples &quot;also&quot; fall under percussion instruments.

*Hammered dulcimer, Cimbalom
*Onavillu
*Piano
*Berimbau
*Jhallari
*Kolitong
*Takumbo
====Aerophone====
 
Most instruments known as aerophones are defined as wind instruments whereby sound is produced by a stream of air being blown through the object. However, plosive aerophones, such as the udu, are percussion instruments and may also overlap with the idiophone family. In certain situations, such as in an orchestra or wind ensemble, wind instruments, such as the Acme siren or various whistles, are played by percussionists, owing to their unconventional and simple nature. 

*Apito or samba whistle
*Siren
*Slide whistle
*Udu
*Whistle or police whistle
===By musical function or orchestration===
When classifying instruments by function it is useful to note if a percussion instrument makes a definite pitch or indefinite pitch.

For example, some percussion instruments such as the marimba and timpani produce an obvious fundamental pitch and can therefore play melody and serve harmonic functions in music. Other instruments such as crash cymbals and snare drums produce sounds with such complex overtones and a wide range of prominent frequencies that no pitch is discernible.

====Definite pitch====

Percussion instruments in this group are sometimes referred to as pitched or tuned.

Examples of percussion instruments with definite pitch:

* Aluphone
* Chimes/Tubular bells
* Crotales
* Glass harmonica
* Glass harp
* Glockenspiel
* Handbells
* Marimba
* Mridangam
* Rototom
* Steelpan
* Tabla
* Timpani
* Tuned Triangle
* Vibraphone
* Wind chimes
* Xylophone
* Xylo-marimba

====Indefinite pitch====
Instruments in this group are sometimes referred to as non-pitched, unpitched, or untuned. Traditionally these instruments are thought of as making a sound that contains such complex frequencies that no discernible pitch can be heard.

In fact many traditionally unpitched instruments, such as triangles and even cymbals, have also been produced as tuned sets.

Examples of percussion instruments with indefinite pitch:

* Bass drum
* Castanets
* Cymbals
* Rainstick
* Slapstick or whip
* Snare drum
* Tamtam
* Tom-tom
===By prevalence in common knowledge===
It is difficult to define what is common knowledge but there are instruments percussionists and composers use in contemporary music that most people would not consider musical instruments. It is worthwhile to &quot;try&quot; to distinguish between instruments based on their acceptance or consideration by a general audience.

For example, most people would not consider an anvil, a brake drum (on a vehicle with drum brakes, the circular hub the brake shoes press against), or a fifty-five gallon oil barrel musical instruments yet composers and percussionists use these objects.

Percussion instruments generally fall into the following categories:

====Conventional or popular====

*Drum kit
*Gong (tamtam)
*Tambourine
*Triangle
====Unconventional====

*Anvils
*Automobile brake drum
*Beer kegs
*Brooms
*Clay pots
*Firearms or explosive charges
*Five gallon buckets
*Garbage cans
*Glass bottles
*Hammer
*Metal pipes
*Metal pots
*Plastic bottles
*Plastic bag
*Rocks in a bucket
*Shopping carts
*Spokes on a bicycle wheel
*Tableware 
One pre-20th century example of found percussion is the use of cannon usually loaded with blank charges in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;1812 Overture&quot;. John Cage, Harry Partch, Edgard Varèse, and Peter Schickele, all noted composers, created entire pieces of music using unconventional instruments. Beginning in the early 20th century perhaps with &quot;Ionisation&quot; by Edgard Varèse which used air-raid sirens among other things, composers began to require that percussionists invent or find objects to produce desired sounds and textures. Another example the use of a hammer and saw in Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;De Natura Sonoris No. 2&quot;. By the late 20th century, such instruments were common in modern percussion ensemble music and popular productions, such as the off-Broadway show, Stomp. Rock band Aerosmith used a number of unconventional instruments in their song Sweet Emotion, including shotguns, brooms, and a sugar bag. The metal band Slipknot is well known for playing unusual percussion items, having two percussionists in the band. Along with deep sounding drums, their sound includes hitting baseball bats and other objects on beer kegs to create a distinctive sound.

===By cultural significance or tradition===
It is not uncommon to discuss percussion instruments in relation to their cultural origin. This led to a division between instruments considered common or modern, and folk instruments with significant history or purpose within a geographic region or culture.

<text>Press Gang is a British children&#x27;s television comedy-drama consisting of 43 episodes across five series that were broadcast from 1989 to 1993. Produced by Richmond Film &amp; Television for Central, it screened on the ITV network in its regular weekday afternoon children&#x27;s strand, CITV, typically in a 4:45 pm slot (days varied over the course of the run).

Aimed at older children and teenagers, the programme was based on the activities of a children&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;Junior Gazette&quot;, produced by pupils from the local comprehensive school. In later series, it was depicted as a commercial venture. The show interspersed comedic elements with the dramatic. As well as addressing interpersonal relationships (particularly in the Lynda-Spike story arc), the show tackled issues such as solvent abuse, child abuse and firearms control.

Written by ex-teacher Steven Moffat, more than half the episodes were directed by Bob Spiers, a British comedy director who also worked on programmes such as &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; and &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;. Critical reception was very positive, particularly for the quality of the writing, and the series has attracted a cult following with a wide age range.

==Storyline==
Famous journalist Matt Kerr arrives from Fleet Street to edit the local newspaper. He sets up a junior version of the paper, &quot;The Junior Gazette&quot;, to be produced by pupils from the local comprehensive school before and after school hours.

Some of the team are &quot;star pupils&quot;, but others have reputations for delinquency. One such pupil, Spike Thomson, is forced to work on the paper rather than be expelled from school. He is immediately attracted to editor Lynda Day, but they bicker, throwing one-liners at each other. Their relationship develops and they have an on-off relationship. They regularly discuss their feelings, especially in the concluding episodes of each series. In the final episode of the third series, &quot;Holding On&quot;, Spike unwittingly expresses his strong feelings to Lynda while being taped. Jealous of his American girlfriend, Zoe, Lynda puts the cassette on Zoe&#x27;s personal stereo, ruining their relationship. The on-screen chemistry between the two leads was reflected off-screen as they became an item for several years.
Although the Lynda and Spike story arc runs throughout the series, most episodes feature self-contained stories and sub-plots. Amongst lighter stories, such as one about Colin accidentally attending a funeral dressed as a pink rabbit, the show tackled many serious issues. Jeff Evans, writing in the &quot;Guinness Television Encyclopedia&quot;, writes that the series adopts a &quot;far more adult approach&quot; than &quot;previous efforts in the same vein&quot; such as &quot;A Bunch of Fives.&quot; Some critics also compared it with &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;, &quot;Lou Grant&quot; &quot;and other thoughtful US dramas, thanks to its realism and its level-headed treatment of touchy subjects.&quot;

The first series approached solvent abuse in &quot;How To Make A Killing&quot;, and the NSPCC assisted in the production of the &quot;Something Terrible&quot; episodes about child abuse. The team were held hostage by a gun enthusiast in series three&#x27;s &quot;The Last Word&quot;, while the final episode approaches drug abuse. The issue-led episodes served to develop the main characters, so that &quot;Something Terrible&quot; is more &quot;about Colin&#x27;s redemption [from selfish capitalist], rather than Cindy&#x27;s abuse.&quot;

According to the British Film Institute, &quot;&quot;Press Gang&quot; managed to be perhaps the funniest children&#x27;s series ever made and at the same time the most painfully raw and emotionally honest. The tone could change effortlessly and sensitively from farce to tragedy in the space of an episode.&quot; Although the series is sometimes referred to as a comedy, Moffat insists that it is a drama with jokes in it. The writer recalls &quot;a long running argument with Geoff Hogg (film editor on &quot;Press Gang&quot;) about whether &quot;Press Gang&quot; was comedy. He insisted that it was and I said it wasn&#x27;t – it was just funny.&quot; Some innuendo leads Moffat to claim that it &quot;had the dirtiest jokes in history; we got away with tons of stuff ... We nearly got away with a joke about anal sex, but they spotted it at the last minute.&quot; In one episode Lynda says she&#x27;s going to &quot;butter him up&quot;, and, when asked (while on a date in a hotel&#x27;s restaurant) if he was staying at the hotel, Colin replies &quot;I shouldn&#x27;t think so: it&#x27;s only the first date.&quot;

Jeff Evans also comments that the series was filmed cinematically, dabbling in &quot;dream sequences, flashbacks, fantasies and, on one occasion, a &quot;Moonlighting&quot;-esque parody of the film &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;.&quot; The show had a strong awareness of continuity, with some stories, incidents and minor characters referred to throughout the series. Actors who played short-term characters in the first two series were invited back to reprise their roles in future episodes. David Jefford (Alex Crockett) was resurrected from 1989&#x27;s &quot;Monday – Tuesday&quot; to appear in the final episode &quot;There Are Crocodiles&quot;, while the same actress (Aisling Flitton) who played a wrong number in &quot;Love and the Junior Gazette&quot; was invited to reprise her character for the third series episode &quot;Chance is a Fine Thing.&quot; &quot;Attention to detail&quot; such as this is, according to Paul Cornell, &quot;one of the numerous ways that the series respects the intelligence of its viewers.&quot;

After the team leaves school, the paper gains financial independence and runs commercially. Assistant editor Kenny leaves at the end of series three to be replaced by Julie, who was the head of the graphics team in series one.

==Characters==
===Main===
* Lynda Day (Julia Sawalha) is the editor of the &quot;Junior Gazette&quot;. She is strong and opinionated, and is feared by many of her team. Moffat has said that the character was partly based on the show&#x27;s &quot;ball-breaking&quot; producer, Sandra C. Hastie. Although she appears very tough, she occasionally exposes her feelings. She quits the paper at the end of &quot;Monday-Tuesday&quot;, and in &quot;Day Dreams&quot; laments &quot;Why do I get everything in my whole stupid life wrong?&quot; Intimidated by socialising, she hiccups at the idea. She is so nervous at a cocktail party, in &quot;At Last a Dragon&quot;, that she attempts to leave on several occasions. The mixture of Lynda&#x27;s sensitive side and her self-sufficient attitude is illustrated in the series&#x27; final episode &quot;There Are Crocodiles.&quot; Reprimanding the ghost of Gary (Mark Sayers), who died after taking a drug overdose, she says:

:Look, I&#x27;m sorry you&#x27;re dead, okay? I &quot;do&quot; care. But to be perfectly honest with you, I don&#x27;t care a lot. You had a choice, you took the drugs, you died. Are you seriously claiming no one warned you it was dangerous? ... I mean, have you had a look at the world lately? ... There&#x27;s plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don&#x27;t get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.
* James &quot;Spike&quot; Thomson (Dexter Fletcher) is an American delinquent, forced to work on the paper rather than being excluded from school. He is immediately attracted to Lynda, and he establishes himself as an important member of the reporting team having been responsible for getting their first lead story. He usually has a range of one-liners, though is often criticised, particularly by Lynda, for excessive joking. Spike often consciously uses humour to lighten the tone, such as in &quot;Monday-Tuesday&quot; when he tries to cheer up Lynda after she feels responsible for David&#x27;s suicide.

: The character was originally written as English, until producer Hastie felt that an American character would enhance the chance of overseas sales. This meant that English-born Fletcher had to act in an American accent for all five years. Moffat says that he isn&#x27;t &quot;sure [that] lumbering Dexter with that accent was a smart move.&quot; The American accent had some fans surprised to learn that Fletcher is actually English.
* Kenny Phillips (Lee Ross) is one of Lynda&#x27;s (few) long-term friends and is her assistant editor in the first three series. Kenny is much calmer than Lynda, though is still dominated by her. Despite this, he is one of the few people able to stand up to Lynda, in his own quiet way. Although he identifies himself as &quot;sweet&quot;, he is unlucky in love: Jenny (Sadie Frost), the girlfriend he meets in &quot;How to Make a Killing&quot;, dumps him because he is too understanding. His secret passion for writing music is revealed at the end of series two, which was influenced by Ross&#x27; interests. Colin organizes and markets a concert for him, and the second series ends with Kenny performing &quot;You Don&#x27;t Feel For Me&quot; (written by Ross himself). Lee Ross was only able to commit to the first six episodes of the 12-episode series three and four filming block because he was expecting a film role. Thus, by series four, Kenny has left for Australia.
* Colin Mathews (Paul Reynolds) is the Thatcherite in charge of the paper&#x27;s finances and advertising. He often wears loud shirts, and his various schemes have included marketing defective half-ping-pong balls (as &#x27;pings&#x27;), exam revision kits and soda that leaves facial stains. Rosie Marcel and Claire Hearnden appear throughout the second series as Sophie and Laura, Colin&#x27;s mischievous young helpers.
* Julie Craig (Lucy Benjamin) is the head of the graphics team in series one. Moffat was impressed with Benjamin&#x27;s performance, and expanded her character for the second series. However she had committed herself to roles in the LWT sitcom &quot;Close to Home&quot; and &quot;Jupiter Moon&quot;, so the character was replaced by Sam. The character returns in the opening episode of series four as researcher on the Saturday morning show &quot;Crazy Stuff&quot;. She arranges for Lynda and Spike to be reunited on live television, but the subsequent complaints about the violence (face slapping) results in Julie&#x27;s firing. After giving Lynda some home truths, Julie replaces Kenny as the assistant editor for the final two series. She is a flirt, and, according to Lynda, was the &quot;official pin-up at the last prison riot.&quot;
* Sarah Jackson (Kelda Holmes) is the paper&#x27;s lead writer. Although she is intelligent she gets stressed, such as during her interview for editorship of the &quot;Junior Gazette&quot;. Her final episode, &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;, shows the development of her friendship with Lynda, and how the latter saw her as a challenge when she first arrived to Norbridge High. Together they had established the underground school magazine: &quot;Damn Magazine&quot;. Her first attempt to leave the newspaper to attend a writing course at the local college is thwarted by Lynda, but she eventually leaves in series five to attend university (mirroring the reason for Holmes&#x27; departure).
* Frazer &quot;Frazz&quot; Davis (Mmoloki Chrystie) is one of Spike&#x27;s co-delinquents forced into working on the paper, his initial main task writing the horoscopes. Frazz is initially portrayed as &quot;intellectually challenged&quot;, such as not understanding the synonymous relationship between &quot;the astrology column&quot; and the horoscopes. Later episodes, however, show him to be devious, such as in &quot;The Last Word: Part 2&quot; when he stuns the gunman using a large array of flashguns.
===Recurring===
* Sam Black (Gabrielle Anwar) replaced Julie as the head of the graphics team in the second series. Sam is very fashion conscious and a flirt, and is surprised when an actor rejects her advances in favour of Sarah. Anwar had auditioned for the role of Lynda. (Many actors who unsuccessfully auditioned for main characters were invited back later for guest roles.) Moffat had expanded the role of Julie after the first series, but Lucy Benjamin was unavailable for series two. Sam, therefore, was basically the character of Julie under a different name, especially in her earlier episodes.
* Danny McColl (Charlie Creed-Miles) the paper&#x27;s photographer. Creed-Miles became disenchanted with his minor role and left after the second series.
* Toni &quot;Tiddler&quot; Tildesley (Joanna Dukes) is the junior member of the team, responsible for the junior section, &quot;Junior Junior Gazette&quot;.
* Billy Homer (Andy Crowe) was also a recurring character. A tetraplegic, he is very competent with computer networks, sometimes hacking into the school&#x27;s database. His storylines are some of the first representations of the Internet in British television. Moffat felt that he was unable to sustain the character, and he appears only sporadically after the first series.

The main adults are deputy headmaster Bill Sullivan (Nick Stringer), maverick editor Matt Kerr (Clive Wood) and experienced &quot;Gazette&quot; reporter Chrissie Stewart (Angela Bruce).

==Production==

===Inception===
Bill Moffat, a headmaster from Glasgow, had an idea for a children&#x27;s television programme called &quot;The Norbridge Files&quot;. He showed it to a producer who visited his school, Thorn Primary School in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, when it was used as the location for an episode of Harry Secombe&#x27;s &quot;Highway&quot;. Producer Sandra C. Hastie liked the idea and showed it to her future husband Bill Ward, co-owner of her company Richmond Films and Television. When she requested a script, Moffat suggested that his 25-year-old son Steven, an English teacher, should write it. Hastie said that it was &quot;the best ever first script&quot; that she had read.

All 43 episodes were written by Steven Moffat. During production of series two, he was having an unhappy personal life after the break-up of his first marriage. His wife&#x27;s new lover was represented in the episode &quot;The Big Finish?&quot; by the character Brian Magboy (Simon Schatzberger), a name inspired by Brian: Maggie&#x27;s boy. Moffat brought in the character so that all sorts of unfortunate things would happen to him, such as having a typewriter dropped on his foot. This period in Moffat&#x27;s life would also be reflected in his sitcom &quot;Joking Apart&quot;.

Central Independent Television had confidence in the project, so rather than the show being shot at their studios in Nottingham as planned, they granted Richmond a £2 million budget. This enabled it to be shot on 16 mm film, rather than the regular, less expensive videotape, and on location, making it very expensive compared with most children&#x27;s television. These high production costs almost led to its cancellation at the end of the second series, by which time Central executive Lewis Rudd was unable to commission programmes by himself.

===Directors===
More than half of the episodes were directed by Bob Spiers, a noted British comedy director who had previously worked on &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; amongst many other programmes. He would work again with Moffat on his sitcom &quot;Joking Apart&quot; and &quot;Murder Most Horrid&quot;, and with Sawalha on &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;. According to Moffat, Spiers was the &quot;principal director&quot; taking an interest in the other episodes and setting the visual style of the show. Spiers particularly used tracking shots, sometimes requiring more dialogue to be written to accommodate the length of the shot. The other directors would come in and &quot;do a Spiers&quot;. All of the directors were encouraged to attend the others&#x27; shoots so that the visual style would be consistent.

The first two episodes were directed by Colin Nutley. However, he was unhappy with the final edit and requested that his name be removed from the credits. Lorne Magory directed many episodes, notably the two-part stories &quot;How To Make A Killing&quot; and &quot;The Last Word.&quot; One of the founders of Richmond Films and Television, Bill Ward, directed three episodes, and Bren Simson directed some of series two. The show&#x27;s cinematographer James Devis took the directorial reins for &quot;Windfall&quot;, the penultimate episode.

===Location===
Whilst the show was set in the fictional town of Norbridge, it was mostly filmed in Uxbridge, in the west of Greater London. Many of the scenes were shot at Haydon School in Pinner. The first series was filmed entirely on location, but after the demolition of the building used as the original newspaper office, interior shots were filmed in Pinewood Studios for the second series, and the exterior of the building was not seen beyond that series. Subsequent series were filmed at Lee International Studios at Shepperton (series three and four) and Twickenham Studios (series five).

===Music and title sequences===
The theme music was composed by Peter Davis (who after the second series composed the rest of the series alone as principal composer), John Mealing and John G. Perry. The opening titles show the main characters striking a pose, with the name of the respective actor in a typewriter style typeface. Steven Moffat and Julia Sawalha were not very impressed with the opening titles when discussing them for a DVD commentary in 2004. They were re-recorded for series three, in the same style, to address the actors&#x27; ages and alterations to the set.

Many of the closing titles in the first two series were accompanied by dialogue from two characters. Episodes that ended on a particularly sombre tone, such as &quot;Monday-Tuesday&quot; and &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s News&quot;, used only appropriately sombre music to accompany the end credits. After an emphatic climax, &quot;At Last a Dragon&quot; used an enhanced version of the main theme with more extravagant use of electric guitar. Moffat felt that the voiceovers worked well in the first series, but that they were not as good in the second. Hastie recalls that Moffat was &quot;extremely angry&quot; that &quot;Drop the Dead Donkey&quot; had adopted the style. They were dropped after the second series. The cast, according to Moffat, were &quot;grumpy with having to turn up to a recording studio to record them.&quot;

==Reception==

===Critical reception===
Critical reaction was good, the show being particularly praised for the high quality and sophistication of the writing. The first episode was highly rated by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the &quot;Times Educational Supplement&quot;. In his emphatic review, Paul Cornell writes that:

&quot;Press Gang&quot; has proved to be a series that can transport you back to how you felt as a teenager, sharper that the world but with as much angst as acute wit ... Never again can a show get away with talking down to children or writing sloppily for them. &quot;Press Gang&quot;, possibly the best show in the world.

&quot;Time Out&quot; said that &quot;this is quality entertainment: the kids are sharp, the scripts are clever and the jokes are good.&quot; The BBC&#x27;s William Gallagher called it &quot;pretty flawless&quot;, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; retrospectively commending the series. Others, such as Popmatters, have also commented upon how &quot;the show is renowned ... for doing something kid television at the time didn&#x27;t do (and, arguably, still doesn&#x27;t): it refused to treat its audience like children.&quot; Comedian Richard Herring recalls watching the show as a recent graduate, commenting that it &quot;was subtle, sophisticated and much too good for kids.&quot; According to Moffat, &quot;&quot;Press Gang&quot; had gone over very, very well in the industry and I was being touted and romanced all the time.&quot; &quot;Press Gang&quot;&#x27;s complicated plots and structure would become a hallmark of Moffat&#x27;s work, such as &quot;Joking Apart&quot; and &quot;Coupling&quot;.

The series received a Royal Television Society award and a BAFTA in 1991 for &quot;Best Children&#x27;s Programme (Entertainment/Drama)&quot;. It was also nominated for two Writers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain awards, one &quot;Prix Jeunesse&quot; and the 1992 BAFTA for &quot;Best Children&#x27;s Programme (Fiction)&quot;. Julia Sawalha won the Royal Television Society Television Award for &quot;Best Actor – Female&quot; in 1993.

===Repeat showings===
The show gained an even wider adult audience in an early evening slot when repeated on Sundays on Channel 4 in 1991. This crossover is reflected in the BBC&#x27;s review for one of the DVDs when they say that &quot;&quot;Press Gang&quot; is one of the best series ever made for kids. Or adults.&quot;

Nickelodeon showed nearly all of the episodes in a weekday slot in 1997. The final three episodes of the third series, however, were not repeated on the children&#x27;s channel because of their content: &quot;The Last Word&quot; double episode with the gun siege, and &quot;Holding On&quot; with the repetition of the phrase &quot;divorce the bitch&quot;. On the first transmission of the latter on 11 June 1991, continuity announcer Tommy Boyd warned viewers that it contained stronger than usual language. In 2007, itv.com made the first series, with the exception of &quot;Page One&quot;, available to be viewed on its website free of charge.

2 episodes were broadcast on the CITV Channel on 5 &amp; 6 January 2013, as part of a weekend of archive programmes to celebrate CITV&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Since 2022, the full series is available online on the ITV streaming service ITVX.

===Fan following===
&quot;Press Gang&quot; has attracted a cult following. A fanzine, &quot;Breakfast at Czars&quot;, was produced in the 1990s. Edited by Stephen O&#x27;Brien, it contained a range of interviews with the cast and crew (notably with producer Hastie), theatre reviews and fanfiction. The first edition was included as a PDF file on the series two DVD, while the next three were on the series five disc. An email discussion list has been operational since February 1997. Scholar Miles Booy observes that as Steven Moffat was himself a fan of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, he was able to ingrate the elements that TV fans appreciated, such as:

series finales with big cliff-hangers, rigorous continuity and a slew of running jokes and references which paid those who watched and rewatched the text to pull out its minutia. At the end of the second series, it is remarked that the news team have been following the Spike/Lynda romance &#x27;since page one&#x27;, and only the fans remembered – or discovered on reviewing – that &quot;Page One&quot; was the title of the first episode.

Booy points out that Chris Carter and Joss Whedon would be acclaimed for these elements in the 1990s (in the shows &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;), but &quot;Moffat got there first, and ... in a children&#x27;s TV slot. His was the first show to arrive with a Britain&#x27;s fan&#x27;s sensibility to formal possibilities.&quot;

Two conventions were held in the mid-1990s in Liverpool. The events, in aid of the NSPCC, were each titled &quot;Both Sides of the Paper&quot; and were attended by Steven Moffat, Sandra Hastie, Dexter Fletcher, Paul Reynolds, Kelda Holmes and Nick Stringer. There were screenings of extended rough cuts of &quot;A Quarter to Midnight&quot; and &quot;There Are Crocodiles&quot;, along with auctions of wardrobe and props. When Virgin Publishing prevented Paul Cornell from writing an episode guide, the &quot;Press Gang Programme Guide&quot;, edited by Jim Sangster, was published by Leomac Publishing in 1995. Sangster, O&#x27;Brien and Adrian Petford collaborated with Network DVD on the extra features for the DVD releases.

Big Finish Productions, which produces audio plays based on sci-fi properties, particularly &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, was named after the title of the final episode of the second series. Moffat himself is an ardent &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fan, and became the programme&#x27;s lead writer and executive producer in 2009.

Moffat has integrated many references to secondary characters and locations in &quot;Press Gang&quot; in his later work. His 1997 sitcom &quot;Chalk&quot; refers to a neighbouring school as Norbridge High, run by Mr Sullivan, and to the characters Dr Clipstone (&quot;UneXpected&quot;), Malcolm Bullivant (&quot;Something Terrible&quot;) and David Jefford (&quot;Monday-Tuesday&quot;/&quot;There are Crocodiles&quot;), a pupil who Mr Slatt (David Bamber) reprimands for masturbating. The name &quot;Talwinning&quot; appears as the name of streets in &quot;A Quarter to Midnight&quot; and &quot;Joking Apart&quot;, and as the surname of the protagonist in &quot;Dying Live&quot;, an episode of &quot;Murder Most Horrid&quot; written by Moffat, as well as the name of a librarian in his &quot;Doctor Who&quot; prose short story, &quot;Continuity Errors&quot;, which was published in the 1996 Virgin Books anthology &quot;Decalog 3: Consequences&quot;. The name &quot;Inspector Hibbert&quot;, from &quot;The Last Word&quot;, is given to the character played by Nick Stringer in &quot;Elvis, Jesus and Jack&quot;, Moffat&#x27;s final &quot;Murder Most Horrid&quot; contribution. Most recently, in the first episode of Moffat&#x27;s &quot;Jekyll&quot;, Mr Hyde (James Nesbitt) whistled the same tune as Lynda in &quot;Going Back to Jasper Street&quot;.

===Proposed television movie===
A television film called &quot;Deadline&quot; was planned. It was set a few years after the series and aimed at a more adult audience. At one stage in 1992, series 4 was intended to be the last, and the movie was proposed as a follow-up. However, making of the film fell through when a fifth series was commissioned instead. The idea of the follow-up film was reconsidered several times during the 1990s, but every time fell through for various reasons.

In June 2007, &quot;The Stage&quot; reported that Moffat and Sawalha are interested in reviving &quot;Press Gang&quot;. He said: &quot;I would revive that like a shot. I would love to do a reunion episode—a grown-up version. I know Julia Sawalha is interested—every time I see her she asks me when we are going to do it. Maybe it will happen—I would like it to.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; advocated the show&#x27;s revival, arguing that &quot;a revamped &quot;Press Gang&quot; with Moffat at the helm could turn the show from a cult into a national institution - a petri dish for young acting and writing talent to thrive. It&#x27;s part of our TV heritage and definitely worthy of resuscitation.&quot;

At the Edinburgh International Television Festival in August 2008, Moffat told how he got drunk after the wrap party for &quot;Jekyll&quot; and pitched the idea of a &quot;Press Gang&quot; reunion special to the Head of Drama at the BBC, John Yorke. Despite Yorke&#x27;s approval, the writer said that he was too busy with his work on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; to pursue the idea.

==Merchandise==
Several products have been released, specifically four novelisations, a video and the complete collection on DVD.

Four novelisations were written by Bill Moffat and published by Hippo Books/Scholastic in 1989 and 1990 based on the first two series. &quot;First Edition&quot; was based on the first three episodes, with &quot;Public Exposure&quot; covering &quot;Interface&quot; and &quot;How to Make a Killing.&quot; The third book, &quot;Checkmate&quot;, covered &quot;Breakfast at Czar&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Picking Up the Pieces&quot; and &quot;Going Back to Jasper Street&quot;, and reveals that Julie left the graphics department to go to art college. The fourth and final book, &quot;The Date&quot;, is a novelisation of &quot;Money, Love and Birdseed&quot;, &quot;Love and the Junior Gazette&quot; and &quot;At Last a Dragon.&quot; Each book featured an eight-page photographic insert.

VCI Home Video, with Central Video, released one volume on VHS in 1990 featuring the first four episodes: &quot;Page One&quot;, &quot;Photo Finish&quot;, &quot;One Easy Lesson&quot; and &quot;Deadline.&quot; The complete series of &quot;Press Gang&quot; is available on DVD (Region 2, UK) from Network DVD and in Australia (Region 4) from Force Entertainment. Four episodes of the second series DVD features an audio commentary by Julia Sawalha and Steven Moffat, in which the actress claims to remember very little about the show. Shooting scripts and extracts from Jim Sangster&#x27;s programme guide (published by Leomac Publishing) are included in PDF format from series two onwards. The second series DVD set also contains the only existing copy, in offline edit form, of an unaired documentary filmed during production of series two.

<doc id="24642" wikidata="Q227713" url="?curid=24642" title="Pope Innocent VII">
<text>Pope Innocent VII (; ; 1339 – 6 November 1406), born Cosimo de&#x27; Migliorati, was head of the Catholic Church from 17 October 1404 to his death, in November 1406. He was pope during the period of the Western Schism (1378–1417), and was opposed by the Avignon claimant Benedict XIII. Despite good intentions, he did little to end the schism, owing to the troubled state of affairs in Rome, and his distrust of the sincerity of Benedict XIII, and King Ladislaus of Naples.

==Early life==
Cosimo de&#x27; Migliorati was born to a noble family of Sulmona in the Abruzzi, son of Gentile Migliorati and wife Mascia Oderisi and uncle of cardinal Giovanni Migliorati. He distinguished himself by his learning in both civil and Canon Law, which he taught for a time at Perugia and Padua. His teacher Giovanni da Legnano sponsored him at Rome, where Pope Urban VI (1378–89) took him into the Curia, sent him for ten years as papal collector to England, made him Bishop of Bologna in 1386 at a time of strife in that city, and Archbishop of Ravenna in 1387.

Pope Boniface IX made him cardinal-priest of S. Croce in Gerusalemme (1389) and sent him as legate to Lombardy and Tuscany in 1390. When Boniface IX died, there were present in Rome delegates from the rival pope at Avignon, Benedict XIII. The Roman cardinals asked these delegates whether their master would abdicate if the cardinals refrained from holding an election. When they were bluntly told that Benedict XIII would never abdicate (indeed he never did), the cardinals proceeded to an election. First, however, they each undertook a solemn oath to leave nothing undone, and, if need be, lay down the tiara to end the schism.

==Papacy==
Migliorati was unanimously chosen – by eight cardinals – on 17 October 1404 and took the name of Innocent VII. There was a general riot by the Ghibelline party in Rome when news of his election got out, but peace was maintained by the aid of King Ladislaus of Naples, who hastened to Rome with a band of soldiers to assist the Pope in suppressing the insurrection. For his services the king extorted various concessions from Innocent VII, among them the promise that Ladislaus&#x27; claim to Naples would not be compromised, which claim had been challenged until very recently by Louis II of Anjou. That suited Innocent VII, who had no intention of reaching an agreement with Avignon that would compromise his claims to the Papal States. Thus Innocent VII was laid under embarrassing obligations, from which he freed himself.

Innocent VII had made the great mistake of elevating his highly unsuitable nephew Ludovico Migliorati – a colorful condottiero formerly in the pay of Giangaleazzo Visconti of Milan – to be Captain of the Papal Militia, an act of nepotism that cost him dearly. Innocent further named him the rector of Todi in April 1405. In August 1405, Ludovico Migliorati, using his power as head of the militia, seized eleven members of the obstreperous Roman partisans on their return from a conference with the Pope, had them murdered in his own house, and had their bodies thrown from the windows of the hospital of Santo Spirito into the street. There was an uproar. Pope, court and cardinals, with the Migliorati faction, fled towards Viterbo. Ludovico took the occasion of driving off cattle that were grazing outside the walls, and the Papal party were pursued by furious Romans, losing thirty members, whose bodies were abandoned in the flight, including the Abbot of Perugia, struck down under the eyes of the Pope.

Innocent&#x27;s protector Ladislaus sent a squad of troops to quell the riots, and by January 1406 the Romans again acknowledged Papal temporal authority, and Innocent VII felt able to return. But Ladislaus, not content with the former concessions, desired to extend his authority in Rome and the Papal States. To attain his end he aided the Ghibelline faction in Rome in their revolutionary attempts in 1405. A squad of troops which King Ladislaus had sent to the aid of the Colonna faction was still occupying the Castle of Sant&#x27; Angelo, ostensibly protecting the Vatican, but making frequent sorties upon Rome and the neighbouring territory. Only after Ladislaus was excommunicated did he yield to the demands of the Pope and withdraw his troops.

Shortly after his accession in 1404 Innocent VII had taken steps to keep his oath by proclaiming a council to resolve the Western Schism. King Charles VI of France, theologians at the University of Paris, such as Pierre d&#x27;Ailly and Jean Gerson, and King Rupert of Germany, were all urging such a meeting. However, the troubles of 1405 furnished him with a pretext for postponing the meeting, claiming that he could not guarantee safe passage to his rival Benedict XIII if he came to the council in Rome. Benedict, however, made it appear that the only obstacle to the end of the Schism was the unwillingness of Innocent VII. Innocent VII was unreceptive to the proposal that he as well as Benedict XIII should resign in the interests of peace.

==Death==
Innocent died in Rome on 6 November 1406. It is said that Innocent VII planned the restoration of the Roman University, but his death brought an end to such talk.

<text>Pope Innocent VIII (; ; 1432 – 25 July 1492), born Giovanni Battista Cybo (or Cibo), was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 29 August 1484 to his death, in July 1492. Son of the viceroy of Naples, Cybo spent his early years at the Neapolitan court. He became a priest in the retinue of Cardinal Calandrini, half-brother to Pope Nicholas V (1447–55); Bishop of Savona under Pope Paul II; and with the support of Cardinal Giuliano Della Rovere he was made a cardinal by Pope Sixtus IV. After intense politicking by Della Rovere, Cybo was elected pope in 1484. King Ferdinand I of Naples had supported Cybo&#x27;s competitor, Rodrigo Borgia. The following year, Pope Innocent supported the barons in their failed revolt.

During his papacy, Pope Innocent issued a papal bull on witchcraft named Summis desiderantes affectibus. In March 1489, Cem, the captive brother of Bayezid II, the sultan of the Ottoman Empire, came into Innocent&#x27;s custody. Viewing his brother as a rival, the Sultan paid Pope Innocent not to set him free. The amount he paid to Pope Innocent was 120,000 crowns (an amount equal to all of the annual revenue to the Vatican) in addition to some holy relics and another sum of money to be paid annually. Any time the Sultan threatened war against the Christian Balkans, Innocent threatened to release his brother. On 28 January 1495, Cem was released by Innocent&#x27;s successor, Pope Alexander VI, into the custody of King Charles&#x27;s army.

==Early years==
In 1432, Giovanni Battista Cybo was born in Genoa, the son of Arano Cybo and wife Teodorina de Mari. His father was from an old Genoese family of Greek ancestry, a viceroy of Naples and then a senator in Rome under Pope Calixtus III. Giovanni Battista&#x27;s early years were spent at the Neapolitan court. While in Naples he was appointed a Canon of the Cathedral of Capua, and was given the Priory of Santa Maria d&#x27;Arba in Genoa. After the death of King Alfonso (1458), friction between Giovanni Battista and the Archbishop of Genoa induced him to resign his canonry, and to go to Padua and then to Rome for his education.

==Early career==
In Rome he became a priest in the retinue of Cardinal Calandrini, half-brother to Pope Nicholas V (1447–55). In 1467, he was made Bishop of Savona by Pope Paul II, but exchanged this see in 1472 for that of Molfetta in south-eastern Italy. In 1473, with the support of Giuliano Della Rovere, later Pope Julius II, he was made cardinal by Pope Sixtus IV, whom he succeeded on 29 August 1484 as Pope Innocent VIII.

==Papal election==

The papal conclave of 1484 was rife with factions, while gangs rioted in the streets. In order to prevent the election of the Venetian Cardinal Barbo, Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals, on the evening before the election, after the cardinals had retired for the night, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, nephew of the late Pope, and Cardinal Borgia, the Vice-Chancellor, visited a number of cardinals and secured their votes with the promise of various benefices.

It was claimed that Cardinal della Rovere met secretly with Cardinal Marco Barbo in order to secure him more votes to become pope if he was promised a residence, though Barbo refused in fear it would make the conclave invalid due to simony. Cardinal della Rovere then met with Borgia, who disliked Barbo and wished to block his election, with an offer to turn their votes over to Cibò, promising them benefits for doing so.

==Papacy==
Shortly after his investiture, Innocent VIII addressed a fruitless summons to Christendom to unite in a crusade against the Turks. A protracted conflict with King Ferdinand I of Naples was the principal obstacle. Ferdinand&#x27;s oppressive government led in 1485 to a rebellion of the aristocracy, known as the Conspiracy of the Barons, which included Francesco Coppola and Antonello Sanseverino of Salerno and was supported by Pope Innocent VIII. Innocent excommunicated Ferdinand in 1489 and invited King Charles VIII of France to come to Italy with an army and take possession of the Kingdom of Naples, a disastrous political event for the Italian peninsula as a whole. The immediate conflict was not ended until 1494, after Innocent VIII&#x27;s death.

===Relations with the Ottoman Empire===
Bayezid II ruled as Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1481 to 1512. His rule was contested by his brother Cem, who sought the support of the Mamluks of Egypt. Defeated by his brother&#x27;s armies, Cem sought protection from the Knights of St. John in Rhodes. Prince Cem offered perpetual peace between the Ottoman Empire and Christendom. However, the sultan paid the Knights a large amount to keep Cem captive. Cem was later sent to the castle of Pierre d&#x27;Aubusson in France. Sultan Bayezid sent a messenger to France and requested Cem to be kept there; he agreed to make an annual payment in gold for his brother&#x27;s expenses.

In March 1489, Cem was transferred to the custody of Innocent VIII. Cem&#x27;s presence in Rome was useful because whenever Bayezid intended to launch a military campaign against the Christian nations of the Balkans, the Pope would threaten to release his brother. In exchange for maintaining the custody of Cem, Bayezid paid Innocent VIII 120,000 crowns, a relic of the Holy Lance and an annual fee of 45,000 ducats. Cem died in Capua on 25 February 1495 on a military expedition under the command of King Charles VIII of France to conquer Naples.

===Relations with witchcraft===
On the request of German inquisitor Heinrich Kramer, Innocent VIII issued the papal bull &quot;Summis desiderantes affectibus&quot; (5 December 1484), which supported Kramer&#x27;s investigations against magicians and witches:
:&quot;It has recently come to our ears, not without great pain to us, that in some parts of upper Germany, [...] Mainz, Köln, Trier, Salzburg, and Bremen, many persons of both sexes, heedless of their own salvation and forsaking the catholic faith, give themselves over to devils male and female, and by their incantations, charms, and conjurings, and by other abominable superstitions and sortileges, offences, crimes, and misdeeds, ruin and cause to perish the offspring of women, the foal of animals, the products of the earth, the grapes of vines, and the fruits of trees, as well as men and women, cattle and flocks and herds and animals of every kind, vineyards also and orchards, meadows, pastures, harvests, grains and other fruits of the earth; [...]&quot;

The bull was written in response to the request of Dominican Heinrich Kramer for explicit authority to prosecute witchcraft in Germany, after he was refused assistance by the local ecclesiastical authorities, who disputed his authority to work in their dioceses. Some scholars view the bull as &quot;clearly political&quot;, motivated by jurisdictional disputes between the local German Catholic priests and clerics from the Office of the Inquisition who answered more directly to the pope.
Nonetheless, the bull failed to ensure that Kramer obtained the support he had hoped for, causing him to retire and to compile his views on witchcraft into his book &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;, which was published in 1487. Kramer would later claim that witchcraft was to blame for bad weather. Both the papal letter appended to the work and the supposed endorsement of Cologne University for it are problematic. The letter of Innocent VIII is not an approval of the book to which it was appended, but rather a charge to inquisitors to investigate diabolical sorcery and a warning to those who might impede them in their duty, that is, a papal letter in the by then conventional tradition established by John XXII and other popes through Eugenius IV and Nicholas V (1447–55).

===Other events===
In 1487, Innocent confirmed Tomas de Torquemada as Grand Inquisitor of Spain. Also in 1487, Innocent issued a bull Id Nostri Cordis denouncing the views of the Waldensians (Vaudois), offering plenary indulgence to all who should engage in a Crusade against them. Alberto de&#x27; Capitanei, archdeacon of Cremona, responded to the bull by organizing a crusade to fulfill its order and launched an offensive in the provinces of Dauphiné and Piedmont. Charles I, Duke of Savoy eventually interfered to save his territories from further confusion and promised the Vaudois peace, but not before the offensive had devastated the area and many of the Vaudois fled to Provence and south to Italy.

The noted Franciscan theologian Angelo Carletti di Chivasso, whom Innocent in 1491 appointed as Apostolic Nuncio and Commissary, conjointly with the Bishop of Mauriana, was involved in reaching the peaceful agreement between Catholics and Waldensians.

In 1486, Innocent VIII was persuaded that at least thirteen of the 900 theses of Giovanni Pico della Mirandola were heretical, and the book containing the theses was interdicted.

In Rome, he ordered the Belvedere of the Vatican to be built, intended for summer use, on an unarticulated slope above the Vatican Palace. His successor would later turn the building into the Cortile del Belvedere. In season, he hunted at Castello della Magliana, which he enlarged. Constantly confronted with a depleted treasury, he resorted to the objectionable expedient of creating new offices and granting them to the highest bidders. The fall of Granada in January 1492, was celebrated in the Vatican and Innocent granted Ferdinand II of Aragon the epithet &quot;Catholic Majesty.&quot;

===Slavery===
It was noted that the attitude of Renaissance popes towards slavery, a common institution worldwide in contemporary cultures, varied. Minnich states that those who allowed the slave trade did so in the hope of gaining converts to Christianity. In the case of Innocent he permitted trade with Barbary merchants in which foodstuffs would be given in exchange for slaves who could then be converted to Christianity.

King Ferdinand of Aragon gave Innocent 100 Moorish slaves, who were shared out with favoured Cardinals. The slaves of Innocent were called &quot;mori&quot;, meaning &quot;dark-skinned men&quot;, in contrast to negro slaves who were called &quot;mori neri&quot;, meaning &quot;black moors&quot;.

===Canonizations===
The pope named two saints during his pontificate: Catherine of Vadstena (1484) and Leopold III (1485).

===Consistories===

Innocent VIII named eight cardinals in one consistory which was held on 9 March 1489; the pope named three of those cardinals &quot;in pectore&quot; (one of whom being a successor in Giovanni de&#x27; Medici who became Pope Leo X) with two of them having their names released after the pope died to ensure that they could vote in the 1492 conclave.

==Death==
By July 1492, Innocent had become very skinny. To Filippo Valori, he had become &#x27;an inert mass of flesh, incapable of assimilating any nourishment but a few drops of milk from a young woman&#x27;s breast&#x27;. 
He then developed a fever and died.

===Tomb===
Innocent was first buried in the Oratory of Our Lady in Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The tomb was crafted by Antonio del Pollaiuolo, who completed the work shortly before his own death in February 1498.
Around 1507 it was moved to the &quot;Shroud&quot; aisle adjacent to the Chapel of the Holy Lance. 

The inscription below his tomb in Saint Peter&#x27;s states: &quot;Nel tempo del suo Pontificato, la gloria della scoperta di un nuovo mondo&quot; (transl. &quot;During his Pontificate, the glory of the discovery of a new world.&quot;). Writer Ruggero Marino, in his book &quot;Cristoforo Colombo e il Papa tradito&quot; (transl. &quot;Christopher Columbus and the betrayed Pope&quot;) argues that since Innocent died shortly before the departure of Christopher Columbus on his presumedly first voyage over the Atlantic, this suggests that Columbus actually traveled before the known date and re-discovered the Americas for the Europeans before the supposed date of 12 October 1492.

At some point the pope&#x27;s coat of arms was replaced with an inscription, and the position of the two images of Innocent switched. After completion of the nave of the new basilica, in 1621 the monument was dismantled and relocated courtesy of Innocent&#x27;s great nephew, Alberico Cybo Malaspina, prince of Massa, duke of Ferentillo, and marquis of Carrara. 

&quot;The monument does have some historical inaccuracies, as already widely noted by the critics...&quot;: &quot;Ciibo&quot; instead of &quot;Cibo&quot;, &quot;vixit&quot; instead of &quot;sedit&quot;, the date of death as &quot;1497&quot; instead of &quot;1492&quot;, a reference to the &quot;Crucis Ssancro Santi; in addition, a reference to Bayezid as Imper(atore) scratched out and replaced with &quot;Tyrant&quot;, any of which could have taken place during the reconstruction.

==Family==
Innocent had at least seven illegitimate children born before he entered the clergy. Only two of them, a son and a daughter, were recognized and legitimized, &quot;towards whom his nepotism had been as lavish as it was shameless&quot;. In 1487, he married his elder son Franceschetto Cybo (d. 1519) to Maddalena de&#x27; Medici (1473–1528), the daughter of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, who in return obtained the cardinal&#x27;s hat for his 13-year-old son Giovanni, later Pope Leo X. His daughter Teodorina Cybo married Gerardo Usodimare and had a son, Aranino Cybo (father of Gherardo Cybo), and two daughters: Battistina Usodimare, who married Luigi d&#x27;Aragona, and Peretta Usodimare (Rome, 1478-Genoa, 3 December 1550), who married firstly Alfonso I del Carretto, and secondly Andrea Doria. Savonarola chastised him for his worldly ambitions.

His grandnephew Bindo Altoviti was one of the most influential bankers of his time and a notable patron of the arts, being friends with Raphael and Michelangelo.

<text>Pope Innocent IX (; ; 20 July 1519 – 30 December 1591), born Giovanni Antonio Facchinetti, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 29 October to 30 December 1591.

Prior to his short papacy, he had been a canon lawyer, diplomat, and chief administrator during the reign of Pope Gregory XIV (r. 1590–1591).

He entered the service of the influential Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. As papal legate to Venice, he helped negotiate the formation of the Holy League, an alliance of Spanish and Italian maritime powers to challenge the Ottoman Empire’s control of the eastern Mediterranean, and which resulted in victory at the Battle of Lepanto.

==Biography==
===Early life and priesthood===
Giovanni Antonio Facchinetti was born in Bologna on 22 July 1519, son of Antonio della Noce, called &quot;il Facchinetto&quot;, and Francesca Cini. His father&#x27;s family was originally from Cravegna, in the Val d&#x27;Ossola (where his birthplace still stands). The surname of his family seems to have actually been Nocetti (or de Nuce), but in fact the future pontiff was called Facchinetti after the humble job carried out by his father, who was a porter.

Giovanni studied at the University of Bologna - which was pre-eminent in jurisprudence — where he obtained a doctorate in both civil and canon law in 1544. He was later ordained to the priesthood on 11 March 1544 and was appointed a canon of the church of Saints Gervasio and Protasio of Domodossola in 1547.

Giovanni traveled to Rome and he became the secretary to Cardinal Niccolò Ardinghelli. He entered the service of Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, the Archbishop of Avignon, who sent Facchinetti to Avignon as his ecclesiastical representative and subsequently recalled him to the management of his affairs at Parma. He was also made the Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura in 1559 and held that post for a year.

===Episcopate and cardinalate===
In 1560, Facchinetti was named as the Bishop of Nicastro, in Calabria, and in 1562 was present at the Council of Trent. He was the first bishop to actually reside in the diocese in three decades. Pope Pius V (1566–1572) sent him as papal nuncio to Venice in 1566 to further the papal alliance with Spain and Venice against the Turks, which ultimately resulted in the victory of Lepanto in 1571. He was recalled from Venice in 1572 and was made the Prior Commendatario of Sant&#x27;Andrea di Carmignano in the diocese of Padua from 1576 to 1587.

Relinquishing his see to pursue his career in Rome in 1575 and also because of health reasons, he was named the Titular Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem in 1572. He occupied that post until he was made a cardinal. Pope Gregory XIII made him a cardinal on 12 December 1583 as the Cardinal-Priest of Santi Quattro Coronati and he was to receive the red hat and title on 9 January 1584. Pope Gregory XIV made him the Prefect of the Apostolic Signatura in 1591.

==Papacy==

Even before Pope Gregory XIV died, Spanish and anti-Spanish factions were electioneering for the next pope. Philip II of Spain&#x27;s (r. 1556–1598) high-handed interference at the previous conclave was not forgotten: he had barred all but seven cardinals. This time the Spanish party in the College of Cardinals did not go so far, but they still controlled a majority, and after a quick conclave they raised Facchinetti to the papal chair as Pope Innocent IX. It took three ballots to elect him as pope. Facchinetti received 24 votes on 28 October but was not successful. He received 28 votes on 29 October in the second ballot while the third saw him prevail. Facchinetti took his papal name to honor Pope Innocent III.

The cardinal protodeacon Andreas von Austria crowned Innocent IX as pontiff on 3 November 1591. He elevated two cardinals to the cardinalate in the only papal consistory of his papacy on 18 December 1591.

Mindful of the origin of his success, Innocent IX supported, during his two months&#x27; pontificate, the cause of Philip II and the Catholic League against Henry IV of France (r. 1589–1610) in the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598), where a Papal army was in the field.

His grandnephew Giovanni Antonio Cardinal Facchinetti de Nuce Jr., was one of two cardinals appointed during the weeks of Innocent IX&#x27;s pontificate. A later member of the cardinalate was his great-grandnephew Cesare Facchinetti (made a cardinal in 1643).

==Death==

On 18 December, despite being ill, the pope made a pilgrimage of Rome&#x27;s seven pilgrimage churches and caught a cold as a result. This became a heavy cough combined with a fever that led to his death shortly after he received Extreme Unction.

Innocent IX died in the early morning of 30 December 1591. He was buried in the Vatican Grottoes in a simple tomb.

<doc id="24645" wikidata="Q101266" url="?curid=24645" title="Pope Innocent X">
<text>Pope Innocent X (6 May 1574 – 7 January 1655), born Giovanni Battista Pamphilj (or [[Pamphili]]), was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 15 September 1644 to his death, in January 1655.

Born in Rome of a family from Gubbio in Umbria who had come to Rome during the pontificate of Pope Innocent IX, Pamphili was trained as a lawyer and graduated from the Collegio Romano. He followed a conventional &quot;cursus honorum&quot;, following his uncle Girolamo Pamphili as auditor of the Rota, and like him, attaining the position of cardinal-priest of Sant&#x27;Eusebio. Before becoming pope, Pamphili served as a papal diplomat to Naples, France, and Spain.

Pamphili succeeded Pope Urban VIII (1623–44) on 15 September 1644 as Pope Innocent X, after a contentious papal conclave that featured a rivalry between French and Spanish factions.

Innocent X was one of the most politically shrewd pontiffs of the era, greatly increasing the temporal power of the Holy See. Major political events in which he was involved included the English Civil War, conflicts with French church officials over financial fraud issues, and hostilities with the Duchy of Parma related to the First War of Castro.

In theology, Innocent X issued a papal bull condemning the beliefs of Jansenism.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Giovanni Battista Pamphili was born in Rome on 5 May 1574, the son of Camillo Pamphili, of the Roman Pamphili family. The family, originally from Gubbio, was directly descended from Pope Alexander VI.

In 1594 he graduated from the Roman College and followed a conventional path through the ranks of the Catholic Church. He served as a consistorial lawyer in 1601, and in 1604 succeeded his uncle, Cardinal Girolamo Pamphili, as auditor of the Roman Rota, the ecclesiastical appellate tribunal. He was also a canonist of the Sacred Apostolic Penitentiary, a second tribunal.

In 1623 Pope Gregory XV sent him as apostolic nuncio (ecclesiastical diplomat) to the court of the Kingdom of Naples. In 1625 Pope Urban VIII sent him to accompany his nephew, Francesco Barberini, whom he had accredited as nuncio, first to France and then Spain. In January 1626, Pamphili was appointed titular Latin Patriarch of Antioch.

In reward for his labors, in May 1626 Giovanni Battista was made nuncio to the court of Philip IV of Spain. The position led to a lifelong association with the Spaniards which was of great use during the papal conclave of 1644. He was created Cardinal &quot;in pectore&quot; in 1627 and published in 1629.

==Papacy==
===Election===

The 1644 conclave for the election of a successor to Pope Urban VIII was long and contentious, lasting from 9 August to 15 September. A large French faction led by Urban VIII&#x27;s nephews objected to the Spanish candidate, as an enemy of Cardinal Mazarin, who guided French policy. They put up their own candidate (Giulio Cesare Sacchetti) but could not establish enough support for him and agreed to Cardinal Pamphili as an acceptable compromise, though he had served as legate to Spain. Mazarin, bearing the French veto of Pamphili, arrived too late, and the election was accomplished.

===Relations with France===
Pamphili chose to be called Innocent X. Soon after his accession he initiated legal action against the Barberini family for misappropriation of public funds. The brothers Francesco Barberini, Antonio Barberini and Taddeo Barberini fled to Paris, where they found a powerful protector in Cardinal Mazarin. Innocent X confiscated their property, and on 19 February 1646, issued a papal bull decreeing that all cardinals who might leave the Papal States for six months without express papal permission would be deprived of their benefices and eventually of their cardinalate itself. The French Parlement of Paris declared the papal ordinance void in France, but Innocent X did not yield until Mazarin prepared to send troops to Italy. Henceforth the papal policy towards France became more friendly, and somewhat later the Barberini were rehabilitated when the son of Taddeo Barberini, Maffeo Barberini, married Olimpia Giustiniani, a niece of Innocent X.

In 1653, Innocent X, with the &quot;Cum occasione&quot; papal bull, condemned five propositions of Jansenius&#x27;s &quot;Augustinus&quot;, as heretical and close to Lutheranism. This led to the formulary controversy, Blaise Pascal&#x27;s writing of the &quot;Lettres Provinciales&quot;, and finally to the razing of the Jansenist convent of Port-Royal and the subsequent dissolving of its community.

===Relations with Parma===
The death of Pope Urban VIII is said to have been hastened by his chagrin at the result of the First War of Castro, a war he had undertaken against Odoardo Farnese, Duke of Parma. Hostilities between the papacy and the Duchy of Parma resumed in 1649, and forces loyal to Pope Innocent X destroyed the city of Castro on 2 September 1649.

Innocent X objected to the conclusion of the Peace of Westphalia, which his nuncio, Fabio Chigi, protested in vain. In 1650 Innocent X issued the papal brief &quot;Zelo Domus Dei&quot; against the Peace of Westphalia, and backdated it to 1648 in order to preserve potential claims for confiscated land and property. The protests were ignored by the European powers.

===British Civil Wars===
During the Irish Confederate Wars (1641–53) (the Irish component of the British Civil Wars), Innocent X strongly supported the independent Confederate Ireland, over the objections of Mazarin and the English Queen and then queen mother, Henrietta Maria, exiled in Paris. The pope sent Giovanni Battista Rinuccini, archbishop of Fermo, as a special nuncio to Ireland. He arrived at Kilkenny with a large quantity of arms including 20,000 pounds of gunpowder, and a very large sum of money. Rinuccini hoped he could discourage the Confederates from allying with Charles I and the Royalists in the English Civil War and instead encourage them towards the foundation of an independent Catholic – ruled Ireland.

At Kilkenny, Rinuccini was received with great honours, asserting in his Latin declaration that the object of his mission was to sustain the king but, above all, to rescue from pains and penalties the Catholic people of Ireland in securing the free and public exercise of the Catholic religion, and the restoration of the churches and church property. In the end, Oliver Cromwell restored Ireland to the Parliamentarian side and Rinuccini returned to Rome in 1649, after four fruitless years.

===Other activities===
During the papacy of Pope Urban VIII, the future Innocent X was the pope&#x27;s most significant rival among the College of Cardinals. Antonio Barberini, Urban VIII&#x27;s brother, was a cardinal who had begun his career with the Capuchin brothers. About 1635, at the height of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in Germany, in which the papacy was intricately involved, Cardinal Antonio commissioned Guido Reni&#x27;s painting of the Archangel Michael, trampling Satan, who bears the recognizable features of Innocent X. This bold political artwork still hangs in a side chapel of the Capuchin friars&#x27; Church of the Conception (Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini) in Rome. A legend related to the painting is that the dashing and high-living artist, Guido Reni, had been insulted by rumours he thought were circulated by Cardinal Pamphili.

When, a few years later, Pamphili was raised to the papacy, other Barberini relatives fled to France on embezzlement accusations. Despite this, the Capuchins held fast to their chapel altarpiece.

Innocent was responsible for raising the Colegio de Santo Tomás de Nuestra Señora del Santísimo Rosario into the rank of a university. It is now the University of Santo Tomás in Manila, the oldest existing in Asia.

In 1650, Innocent X celebrated a Jubilee. He embellished Rome with inlaid floors and bas-relief in Saint Peter&#x27;s, erected Gian Lorenzo Bernini&#x27;s &quot;Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi&quot; in Piazza Navona, the Pamphili stronghold in Rome, and ordered the construction of Palazzo Nuovo at the Campidoglio.

Innocent X is also the subject of &quot;Portrait of Innocent X&quot;, a famous painting by Diego Velázquez housed in the family gallery of Palazzo Doria (Doria Pamphilj Gallery). This portrait inspired the &quot;Screaming Pope&quot; paintings by 20th-century painter Francis Bacon, the most famous of which is Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Study after Velázquez&#x27;s Portrait of Pope Innocent X&quot;.

Innocent X has been described as irritable in his later years. In March 1654, Innocent X suddenly expelled his personal physician of eight years, Gabriel da Fonseca, after Fonseca defended a barber who had bled the Pope. Fonseca claims he had been in service to the Pamphili family for over two decades, and that the Pope had regarded him not only as his physician but also as a private advisor.

Olimpia Maidalchini was married to Innocent X&#x27;s late brother, and was believed to be his mistress because of her influence over him in matters of promotion and politics. This state of affairs was alluded to in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; 9th edition (1880):

German historian Leopold von Ranke concluded that she was not Innocent X&#x27;s lover.

==Death and legacy==
In his later years, Innocent X suffered from gout, causing him intense pain and severely restricting his movements. The eighty-year-old pontiff&#x27;s health began to decline in August 1654. By the evening of 26 December his condition had deteriorated to the extent that the family was summoned.

On 27 December, he blessed his nephew, niece, and their children, and then had a brief meeting with Cardinals Flavio Chigi and Decio Azzolino. That night he had a little rest, though his condition did not improve.

On 28 December, Innocent X received the Last rites and expressed his desire to take leave of the cardinals. In anticipation of the Pope&#x27;s expected death many of the cardinals had already gathered in Rome in advance of a subsequent conclave. Thirty-nine gathered at his bedside at the Quirinal Palace.

On 1 January 1655, Mass was celebrated at the pope&#x27;s bedside, and the same was done on 6 January, when Innocent X also received the Viaticum for the last time. Secretary of State Chigi, who had been in attendance during the last twelve days, Prefect of the Sacred Palace Bishop Scotti, and Sacristan Monsignor Altini, as well as, various attendants were present when the Pope died on the night of 6 January 1655.

The Swiss Guard escorted Papal Camerlengo Cardinal Antonio Barberini to the Quirinal to perform the requisite rituals and Cardinal de&#x27; Medici visited with the Pope&#x27;s three nephews, who were in another room. After an autopsy, the body was embalmed and the next day taken to the Vatican where it was placed on a catafalque in the Sistine Chapel. On 8 January it was transferred to St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, where the sealing of the coffin was witnessed by Cardinals Niccolò Albergati-Ludovisi, Fabio Chigi, Luigi Omodei, Pietro Vito Ottoboni, Marcello Santacroce, Baccio Aldobrandini, Cristoforo Vidman, Lorenzo Raggi, Carlo Pio di Savoia and Gualtieri, Princes Pamphili, Ludovisi and Giustiniani, and the Master of Ceremonies Fulvio Servantio. A funeral held on 17 January. Innocent&#x27;s tomb is located in the Church of Sant&#x27;Agnese in Agone which he had built in 1652 adjacent to the family palace, the Palazzo Pamphili, in Rome.

Innocent X was succeeded by Pope Alexander VII who had promised Innocent X that he would build more schools in Europe.

<text>Property law is the area of law that governs the various forms of ownership in real property (land) and personal property. Property refers to legally protected claims to resources, such as land and personal property, including intellectual property. Property can be exchanged through contract law, and if property is violated, one could sue under tort law to protect it.

The concept, idea or philosophy of property underlies all property law. In some jurisdictions, historically all property was owned by the monarch and it devolved through feudal land tenure or other feudal systems of loyalty and fealty.

==Theory==
The word &quot;property&quot;, in everyday usage, refers to an object (or objects) owned by a person—a car, a book, or a cellphone—and the relationship the person has to it. In law, the concept acquires a more nuanced rendering. Factors to consider include the nature of the object, the relationship between the person and the object, the relationship between a number of people in relation to the object, and how the object is regarded within the prevailing political system. Most broadly and concisely, property in the legal sense refers to the rights of people in or over certain objects or things.

Non-legally recognized or documented property rights are known as informal property rights. These informal property rights are non-codified or documented, but recognized among local residents to varying degrees.

=== Justifications and drawbacks of property rights ===
In capitalist societies with market economies, much of property is owned privately by persons or associations and not the government. Five general justifications have been given on private property rights:

# Private property is an efficient way to manage resources in a decentralized basis, allowing expertise and specialization to develop with regard to the property.
# Private property is a powerful incentive for owners to put it to productive use, because they stand to gain in the investment.
# Private property allows exchanges and modifications.
# Private property is an important source of individual autonomy, giving individuals independence and identity distinct from others.
# Private property, being dispersed, allows individuals to exercise freedom, against others or against the government.

Arguments in favor of limiting private property rights have also been raised:

# Private property can be used in a way that is harmful to others, such as a factory owner causing loud noises in nearby neighborhoods. In economics, this is known as a negative externality. Nuisance laws and government regulations (such as zoning) have been used to limit an owners&#x27; right to use the property in certain ways.
# Property can lead to monopolies, giving the owner the power to unfairly extract advantages from others. Because of this, there are laws on competition and antitrust.
# Property can lead to the commodification of certain domains which people would prefer not to be commodified, such as social relations.
# Private property gives individuals power, which can exacerbate over time and lead to too much inequality within a society. The propensity for inequality is justification of wealth redistribution.

===Natural rights and property===
In his &quot;Second Treatise on Government&quot;, English philosopher John Locke asserted the right of an individual to own one part of the world, when, according to the Bible, God gave the world to all humanity in common. He claimed that although persons belong to God, they own the fruits of their labor. When a person works, that labor enters into the object. Thus, the object becomes the property of that person. However, Locke conditioned property on the Lockean proviso, that is, &quot;there is enough, and as good, left in common for others&quot;.

U.S. Supreme Court Justice James Wilson undertook a survey of the philosophical grounds of American property law in 1790 and 1791. He proceeds from two premises: &quot;Every crime includes an injury: every injury includes a violation of a right.&quot; (Lectures III, ii.) The government&#x27;s role in protecting property depends upon an idea of right. Wilson believes that &quot;man has a natural right to his property, to his character, to liberty, and to safety.&quot; He also indicates that &quot;the primary and principal object in the institution of government... was... to acquire a new security for the possession or the recovery of those rights&quot;.

Wilson states that: &quot;Property is the right or lawful power, which a person has to a thing.&quot; He then divides the right into three degrees: possession, the lowest; possession and use; and, possession, use, and disposition – the highest. Further, he states: &quot;Useful and skillful industry is the soul of an active life. But industry should have her just reward. That reward is property, for of useful and active industry, property is the natural result.&quot; From this simple reasoning he is able to present the conclusion that exclusive, as opposed to communal property, is to be preferred. Wilson does, however, give a survey of communal property arrangements in history, not only in colonial Virginia but also ancient Sparta.

=== Property rights ===
There are two main views on the right to property, the traditional view and the bundle of rights view. The traditionalists believe that there is a core, inherent meaning in the concept of property, while the bundle of rights view states that the property owner only has bundle of permissible uses over the property. The two views exist on a spectrum and the difference may be a matter of focus and emphasis.

William Blackstone, in his &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England,&quot; wrote that the essential core of property is the right to exclude. That is, the owner of property must be able to exclude others from the thing in question, even though the right to exclude is subject to limitations. By implication, the owner can use the thing, unless another restriction, such as zoning law, prevents it. Other traditionalists argue that three main rights define property: the right to exclusion, use and transfer.

An alternative view of property, favored by legal realists, is that property simply denotes a bundle of rights defined by law and social policy. Which rights are included in the bundle known as property rights, and which bundles are preferred to which others, is simply a matter of policy. Therefore, a government can prevent the building of a factory on a piece of land, through zoning law or criminal law, without damaging the concept of property. The &quot;bundle of rights&quot; view was prominent in academia in the 20th century and remains influential today in American law.

==Priority==

Different parties may claim a competing interest in the same property by mistake or by fraud, with the claims being inconsistent of each other. For example, the party creating or transferring an interest may have a valid title, but may intentionally or negligently create several interests wholly or partially inconsistent with each other. A court resolves the dispute by adjudicating the priorities of the interests.

==Property rights and rights to people==
Property rights are rights over things enforceable against all other persons. By contrast, contractual rights are rights enforceable against particular persons. Property rights may, however, arise from a contract; the two systems of rights overlap. In relation to the sale of land, for example, two sets of legal relationships exist alongside one another: the contractual right to sue for damages, and the property right exercisable over the land. More minor property rights may be created by contract, as in the case of easements, covenants, and equitable servitudes.

A separate distinction is evident where the rights granted are insufficiently substantial to confer on the nonowner a definable interest or right in the thing. The clearest example of these rights is the license. In general, even if licenses are created by a binding contract, they do not give rise to property interests.

== Property rights and personal rights ==
Property rights are also distinguished from personal rights. Practically all contemporary societies acknowledge this basic ontological and ethical distinction. In the past, groups lacking political power have often been disqualified from the benefits of property. In an extreme form, this has meant that people have become &quot;objects&quot; of property—legally &quot;things&quot; or chattels (see slavery.) More commonly, marginalized groups have been denied legal rights to own property. These include Jews in England and married women in Western societies until the late 19th century.

The dividing line between personal rights and property rights is not always easy to draw. For instance, is one&#x27;s reputation property that can be commercially exploited by affording property rights to it? The question of the proprietary character of personal rights is particularly relevant in the case of rights over human tissue, organs and other body parts.

In the United States, a &quot;quasi-property&quot; interest has been explicitly declared in the dead body. Also in the United States, it has been recognised that people have an alienable proprietary &quot;right of publicity&quot; over their &quot;persona&quot;. The patent/patenting of biotechnological processes and products based on human genetic material may be characterised as creating property in human life.

A particularly difficult question is whether people have rights to intellectual property developed by others from their . In the pioneering case on this issue, the Supreme Court of California held in &quot;Moore v. Regents of the University of California&quot; (1990) that individuals do not have such a property right.

== Classification ==
Property law is characterised by a great deal of historical continuity and technical terminology. The basic distinction in common law systems is between real property (land) and personal property (chattels).

Before the mid-19th century, the principles governing the transfer of real property and personal property on an intestacy were quite different. Though this dichotomy does not have the same significance anymore, the distinction is still fundamental because of the essential differences between the two categories. An obvious example is the fact that land is immovable, and thus the rules that govern its use must differ. A further reason for the distinction is that legislation is often drafted employing the traditional terminology.

The division of land and chattels has been criticised as being not satisfactory as a basis for categorising the principles of property law since it concentrates attention not on the proprietary interests themselves but on the objects of those interests. Moreover, in the case of fixtures, chattels which are affixed to or placed on land may become part of the land.

Real property is generally sub-classified into:
# corporeal hereditaments – tangible real property (land)
# incorporeal hereditaments – intangible real property such as an easement of way

Although a tenancy involves rights to real property, a leasehold estate is typically considered personal property, being derived from contract law. In the civil law system, the distinction is between movable and immovable property, with movable property roughly corresponding to personal property, while immovable property corresponding to real estate or real property, and the associated rights, and obligations thereon.

== Possession ==
The concept of possession developed from a legal system whose principal concern was to avoid civil disorder. The general principle is that a person in possession of land or goods, even as a wrongdoer, is entitled to take action against anyone interfering with the possession unless the person interfering is able to demonstrate a superior right to do so.

In England, the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977 has significantly amended the law relating to wrongful interference with goods and abolished some longstanding remedies and doctrines.

== Transfer of property ==
The term &quot;transfer of property&quot; means an act by which a living person, company, or state conveys property, in present or in future, to one or more other living persons, to himself and one or more other living persons, to the state, or to a private company. The transfer of property can be consensual or non-consensual, and to transfer property is to perform such an act.

=== Consensual transfers ===
The most common method of acquiring an interest in property is as the result of a consensual transaction with the previous owner, for example, a sale, a gift, or through inheritance. In law, an inheritor is a person who is entitled to receive a share of the heritor&#x27;s (the person who died) property, subject to the rules of inheritance in the jurisdiction of which the heritor was a citizen or where the heritor died or owned property at the time of death. Dispositions by will may also be regarded as consensual transactions, since the effect of a will is to provide for the distribution of the deceased person&#x27;s property to nominated beneficiaries. A person may also obtain an interest in property under a trust established for his or her benefit by the owner of the property.

=== Non-consensual transfers ===
It is also possible for property to pass from one person to another independently of the consent of the property owner. For example, this occurs when a person dies intestate, goes bankrupt, or has the property taken in execution of a court judgment.

There are cases when a person is legally capable of owning property, but is not capable of maintaining and dealing with it (such as paying property taxes). This is the case for young children and mentally handicapped individuals. The state deems them incompetent in their capacity to deal with property. Thus, they must be appointed a legal guardian to deal with the property on the incompetent individual&#x27;s behalf. In cases where the individual cannot find a legal guardian to deal with the property, the property is put up for sale and the incompetent individual is involuntarily deprived of such property.

Tax sales are another process by which individuals can be forcibly deprived of their private property. A tax sale is the forced sale of property by the state due to unpaid taxes on that property. The property is typically auctioned off as a tax sale by the local government to payoff the delinquent taxes on that property. One could make the argument that, given the presence of property taxes, an individual never truly owns a piece of property; they rent it from the government.

Property can also pass from one person to the state independently of the consent of the property owner through the state&#x27;s power of eminent domain. Eminent domain refers to the ability of the state to buyout private property from individuals at their will in order to use the property for public use. Eminent domain requires the state to &quot;justly compensate&quot; the property owner for the acquisition of their land. The practice dates back to at least the 17th century. Common examples include buying land from individuals in order for the state to build public roads, transportation systems, governmental buildings, and to construct certain public goods. The state also uses its eminent domain power for large urban renewal projects by which it will buy out large portions of typically poor housing areas in order to rebuild it.

Eminent domain also consists of enabling the state to condemn certain real estate construction and development rights for various reasons. One must meet location specific regulatory standards and building codes in order to construct on property. The general rule for stairs (in the US) is 7-11 (a 7-inch rise and 11 inch run). More exactly, no more than 7 3/4 inches for the riser (vertical) and a minimum of 10 inches for the tread (horizontal or step). Failure to meet these regulatory standards can result in an inability to receive state building permits, state destruction of property, legal fines, and increased liability.

KELO V. NEW LONDON (04-108) 545 U.S. 469 (2005) was a pivotal case that increased the scope of the eminent domain power of the state. The U.S. supreme court ruled that private property could be condemned by the state &quot;and&quot; transferred to a private company.

=== Legal successor ===
In property law, economics and finance, the term &quot;legal successor&quot; may refer to a legally established successor of property rights (inheritance, interest) or in terms of liabilities (debt).

In the case of bankruptcy of a lender, the legal successor in interest has the right to collect the debt.

== Lease ==
Historically, leases served many purposes, and the regulation varied according to intended purposes and the economic conditions of the time. Leaseholds, for example, were mainly granted for agriculture until the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century, when the growth of cities made the leasehold an important form of landholding in urban areas.

The modern law of landlord and tenant in common law jurisdictions retains the influence of the common law and, particularly, the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; philosophy that dominated the law of contract and the law of property in the 19th century. With the growth of consumerism, the law of consumer protection recognised that common law principles assuming equal bargaining power between parties may cause unfairness. Consequently, reformers have emphasised the need to assess residential tenancy laws in terms of protection they provide to tenants. Legislation to protect tenants is now common.

== Ownership ==

=== Single individuals ===
Property can mostly be owned by any single human. However, many jurisdictions have some stipulations that limit property-owning capacity. The two main limiting factors include citizenship and competency of maintaining property.

In many countries, non-citizens cannot own property or are limited greatly in their capacity to own property. The United States allows foreign entities to buy and own property. But the United States does have stipulations surrounding tribal land owned by the indigenous Native Americans.

Incompetent individuals also cannot own property, at least without a legal guardian. Incompetent individuals consist largely of children and the cognitively impaired. They are legally recognized and allowed to own property, but they cannot deal with it without the consent of their legal guardians. Children do not have the capacity to pay property taxes.

=== Groups ===
All western legal systems allow for a number of different forms of group ownership of property. Group ownership in property law is referred to as co-tenancy, or concurrent ownership. Two or more owners of a property are referred to as co-owners.

==== Concurrent owners ====
In U.S. common law, property can be owned by many different people and parties. Property can be shared by an infinitely divisible number of people. There are three types of concurrent estates, or ways people can jointly own property: joint tenancy, tenancy in common, or tenancy by entirety.

==== Joint Tenancy ====
In joint tenancy, each owner of the property has an undivided interest in it along with full and complete ownership. Each owner in joint tenancy has the full right to occupy and use all of it. If one owner dies in joint tenancy, then the other owner takes control of the deceased owner&#x27;s interest.

===== Tenancy in Common =====
In tenancy in common, the shares of ownership can be equal or unequal in size. One person may own a larger share of the property than another. Even if owners own an unequal amount of shares, all owners still have the right to use all of the property. If one owner dies, their share of the property is transferred to the designated individual in their will contract.

===== Tenancy by the Entirety =====
In tenancy by the entirety, each owner of the property has an undivided interest in it along with full and complete ownership. Each spouse has the full right to occupy and use all of the property. It is only available to married couples. A spouse cannot transfer their interest in the property without the consent of the other spouse. If the couple divorces and goes to court, a judge is granted wide discretion on how to divide the share interests of the property in common-law jurisdictions.

==== Corporate owners ====
Corporations are legal non-human entities that are entitled to property rights just as an individual human is. A corporation has legal power to use and possess property just as a fictitious legal human would. However, a corporation isn&#x27;t a single human, it is the collective will of a group of people who provide a service or build a good. With many agent in play, there are many different and opposing interests in play with respect to ownership. The majority of property is now owned by corporations. They were created under general incorporation statutes that allow such fictitious legal persons to have property rights.

==== State owners ====
The community, or the state, can have many different roles concerning property: facilitator, protector, and owner. In capitalist market economies, the state largely serves as a mediator that facilitates and enforces private property laws.

Communist ideals oppose private property laws. Communism / Marxism advocates for full state / public ownership of property. &quot;Private property has made us so stupid and one-sided that an object is only &quot;ours&quot; when we have it – when it exists for us as capital, or when it is directly possessed, eaten, drunk, worn, inhabited, etc., – in short, when it is &quot;used&quot; by us&quot; (Marx). However, it is important to note that many Marxist–Leninist societies such as China and the dissolved Soviet Union have forms of private property laws.

In the United States, &quot;the federal government owns roughly 640 million acres, about 28% of the 2.27 billion acres of land in the United States. Four major federal land management agencies administer 606.5 million acres of this land (as of September 30, 2018). They are the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and National Park Service (NPS) in the Department of the Interior (DOI) and the Forest Service (FS) in the Department of Agriculture. A fifth agency, the Department of Defense (excluding the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers), administers 8.8 million acres in the United States (as of September 30, 2017), consisting of military bases, training ranges, and more. Together, the five agencies manage about 615.3 million acres, or 27% of the U.S. land base. Many other agencies administer the remaining federal acreage.&quot;

<text>In law, a plea is a defendant&#x27;s response to a criminal charge. A defendant may plead guilty or not guilty. Depending on jurisdiction, additional pleas may be available, including &quot;nolo contendere&quot; (no contest), no case to answer (in the United Kingdom), or an Alford plea (in the United States).

Under common law systems, a defendant who pleads guilty will be convicted if the court accepts the plea. The court will then determine and impose a sentence. Plea bargaining involves discussions between the prosecutor and defendants to reach an agreement for a guilty plea in exchange for a more lenient punishment. 

In civil law jurisdictions, a confession by the defendant is treated like any other piece of evidence. A full confession does not prevent a full trial or relieve the prosecutor from presenting a case to the court.

==Types of plea==
The most common types of plea are &quot;guilty&quot; and &quot;not guilty&quot;.

In some legal systems pleading guilty can result in a more lenient punishment for the defendant; it is thus a type of mitigating factor in sentencing. While in some other legal systems pleading guilty instead can result in a harsher punishment. In a plea bargain, a defendant makes a deal with the prosecution or court to plead guilty in exchange for a more lenient punishment, or for related charges against them to be dropped. A &quot;blind plea&quot; is a guilty plea entered with no plea agreement in place. Plea bargains are particularly common in the United States. Other countries use a more limited form of plea bargaining. In the United Kingdom and Germany, guidelines state that only the timing of the guilty plea can affect the reduction in the punishment, with an earlier plea resulting in a greater reduction.

In the United States, a &quot;nolo contendere&quot; (no contest) plea is when the defendant submits a plea that neither admits nor denies the offense. It has the same immediate effect as a guilty plea because the trial avoids determining the defendant&#x27;s guilt.

===Peremptory pleas===
These pleas claim that a case cannot proceed for some reason. They are so-called because, rather than being an answer to the question of guilt or innocence, they are a claim that the matter of guilt or innocence should not be considered.

They are:
*autrefois convict (or autrefois acquit) – where under the doctrine of double jeopardy, the accused has been previously convicted or acquitted of the same charge and hence cannot be tried again.
*plea of pardon – where the accused has been pardoned for the offense.

==Standing mute==

===Common law===

When a defendant refuses to plead to an indictment it is called &quot;standing mute&quot;, and it has been left to juries to decide the reason for the muteness, whether maliciousness or mental impairment. Historically, during an arraignment an accused person would enter a plea, guilty or not, and after pleading not guilty would be asked how he was to be tried, being expected to answer &quot;By God and my country&quot;. There were various penalties for refusing to do this if one was of sound mind. In cases of piracy or felony the accused was tortured by pressing until he entered a plea; Edward Coke reported details of such during a murder trial in the reign of James I. In 1692 Giles Corey, charged with Witchcraft in New England, was pressed until he died for refusing to answer &quot;By God and my country&quot; after pleading not guilty to the charges. Obtaining pleas by torture was abolished by statute in 1772.

===US criminal procedure===
A defendant who refuses to enter a plea is usually interpreted as giving a plea of not guilty; the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, for instance, state, &quot;If a defendant refuses to enter a plea or if a defendant organization fails to appear, the court must enter a plea of not guilty.&quot; Similarly, if a defendant attempts to enter an unorthodox plea (a &quot;creative plea&quot;), this will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty. One example of this was a defendant accused of a crime committed while protesting a nuclear power plant, who gave his plea as &quot;I plead for the beauty that surrounds us&quot;.

==United States==

===&quot;Voluntary and intelligent&quot;===
A defendant who enters a plea of guilty must do so, in the phraseology of a 1938 United States Supreme Court case, &quot;Johnson v. Zerbst&quot;, &quot;knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently&quot;. The burden is on the prosecution to prove that all waivers of the defendant&#x27;s rights complied with due process standards. Accordingly, in cases of all but the most minor offenses, the court or the prosecution (depending upon local custom and the presiding judge&#x27;s preference) will engage in a plea colloquy wherein they ask the defendant a series of rote questions about the defendant&#x27;s knowledge of his rights and the voluntariness of the plea. Typically the hearing on the guilty plea is transcribed by a court reporter, and the transcript is made a part of the permanent record of the case to preserve the conviction&#x27;s validity from being challenged at some future time. &quot;Intelligent&quot; has been described as &quot;an elusive term, meaning that the defendant knows his rights, the nature of the charge to which he is pleading, and the consequences of his plea.&quot; &quot;Voluntary&quot; has been described as also &quot;an elusive term which has come to mean not induced by &#x27;improper&#x27; inducements, such as bribing or physical violence, but not including the inducements normally associated with charge and sentence bargaining (except for inducements involving &#x27;overcharging&#x27; by prosecutors).&quot; Empirical research has demonstrated that violent conditions in jails during pretrial detention of people who are legally innocent do improperly induce or coerce guilty pleas, but this has not constitutionally invalidated the pleas under current Supreme Court precedent.

Virtually all jurisdictions hold that defense counsel need not discuss with defendants the collateral consequences of pleading guilty, such as consecutive sentencing or even treatment as an aggravating circumstance in an ongoing capital prosecution. However, the Supreme Court recognized an important exception in &quot;Padilla v. Kentucky&quot; (2010), in which the Court held that defense counsel is obligated to inform defendants of the potential immigration consequences of a guilty plea. Thus a defendant who is not advised of immigration consequences may have an ineffective assistance of counsel argument.

In the U.S. federal system, the court must also satisfy itself that there is a factual basis for the guilty plea. However, this safeguard may not be very effective because the parties, having reached a plea agreement, may be reluctant to reveal any information that could disturb the agreement. When a plea agreement has been made, the judge&#x27;s factual basis inquiry is usually perfunctory, and the standard for finding that the plea is factually based is very low.

===Special pleas===
Other special pleas used in criminal cases include the plea of mental incompetence, challenging the jurisdiction of the court over the defendant&#x27;s person, the plea in bar, attacking the jurisdiction of the court over the crime charged, and the plea in abatement, which is used to address procedural errors in bringing the charges against the defendant, not apparent on the &quot;face&quot; of the indictment or other charging instrument. Special pleas in federal criminal cases have been abolished, and defenses formerly raised by special pleas are now raised by motion to dismiss.

A conditional plea is one where the defendant pleads guilty to the offense but expressly reserves the right to appeal certain aspects of the charges (for example, that the evidence was illegally obtained).

In &quot;United States v. Binion&quot;, malingering or feigning illness during a competency evaluation was held to be obstruction of justice and led to an enhanced sentence. Although the defendant had pleaded guilty, he was not awarded a reduction in sentence because the feigned illness was considered to mean that he was not accepting responsibility for his illegal behavior.

== United Kingdom ==

=== &quot;unambiguous plea&quot; ===
A defendant who enters a plea of guilty must do so unequivocally. A guilty plea which is &quot;imperfect, unfinished or otherwise ambiguous&quot; will not legitimate and should the court proceed to sentence on such a plea, there exist grounds for ordering a retrial or quashing the conviction.

In &quot;R v Atkinson&quot;, the Court of Appeal held that, where a defendant entered a plea of &#x27;Guilty, but i intended to defend myself&#x27; this could be held to be an unequivocal plea where the judge had clarified any ambiguity before accepting the plea.

=== Special pleas ===
Three special pleas (though not in the strictest sense of the word) exist in the criminal courts of England and Wales:

Demurrer: Which is an &quot;objection to the form or substance of the indictment&quot;. It is essentially no different than a motion to quash the indictment, however, it continues to exist in law. Unlike standard pleas, this must be entered in writing in advance of the arraignment.

Plea to jurisdiction: Can be entered where the defendant believes the Crown Court does not have the power to hear the case before it, such a plea is usually entered where the offence being charged is summary only. Similarly to Demurrer, this plea must be entered in writing in advance.

Pardon: &quot;It may be relied on where a pardon has been granted by the Crown on the advice of the Home Secretary in exercise of the royal prerogative of mercy. It must be pleaded at the first opportunity (i.e. before arraignment if the pardon has by then been granted). In modern times, the plea has become obsolete.&quot;

==Plea in mitigation==
A plea in mitigation is used during criminal law proceedings in many Commonwealth countries. It typically involves a lawyer telling a judge of extenuating circumstances that could result in a lesser sentence for an offender.

<doc id="24650" wikidata="Q101286" url="?curid=24650" title="Pope Innocent XI">
<text>Pope Innocent XI (; ; 16 May 1611 – 12 August 1689), born Benedetto Odescalchi, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 21 September 1676 until his death on 12 August 1689.

Political and religious tensions with Louis XIV of France were a constant preoccupation for Innocent XI. Within the Papal States, he lowered taxes, produced a surplus in the papal budget and repudiated nepotism within the Church. Innocent XI was frugal in his governance of the Papal States, his methods evident in matters ranging from his manner of dress to a wide range of standards of personal behavior consistent with his conception of Christian values. Once he was elected to the papacy, he applied himself to moral and administrative reform of the Roman Curia. He abolished sinecures and pushed for greater simplicity in preaching as well as greater reverence in worship, requesting this of both the clergy and faithful. In consideration of his diplomatic and financial support for efforts to free Hungary from Turkish domination, he is still widely referred to in the country as the &quot;Saviour of Hungary&quot;.

After a difficult cause for canonization, starting in 1791, which caused considerable controversy over the years and which was stopped on several occasions, he was beatified in 1956 by Pope Pius XII.

==Early life==

Benedetto Odescalchi was born in Como on 16 May 1611, the son of a nobleman of Como, Livio Odescalchi, who died in 1626, and his wife Paola Castelli-Giovanelli from Gandino, who died of the plague in 1630. The child&#x27;s siblings were Carlo Odescalchi (1609 - 1673), married to Beatrice Cusani of the Marquesses of Chignolo (parents of Giovanna Odescalchi (1651 - 14 July 1679), married in Milan on 27 May 1677 as his first wife to Carlo Borromeo-Arese, 6th Marquess of Angera, 11th Count of Arona, with issue), Lucrezia Odescalchi (9 October 1605 - ?), married on 4 February 1621 to Alessandro Erba (6 November 1599 - 31 August 1670), son of Gerolamo Erba and wife Vittoria Olgiati, ancestors of the Erba-Odescalchi, Giulio Maria Odescalchi, Costantino Odescalchi, Nicola Odescalchi and Paolo Odescalchi. He also had several collateral descendants of note through his sister: her grandson Cardinal Benedetto Erba Odescalchi and Cardinal Carlo Odescalchi - Servant of God.

The Odescalchi, a family of minor nobility, were determined entrepreneurs. In 1619, Benedetto&#x27;s brother founded in Genoa with his three uncles a bank which quickly grew into a successful money-lending business. After completing his studies in grammar and letters, the 15-year-old Benedetto moved to Genoa to take part in the family business as an apprentice. Lucrative economic transactions were established with clients in the major Italian and European cities, such as Nuremberg, Milan, Kraków, and Rome.

In 1626 Benedetto&#x27;s father died, and he began schooling in the humanities taught by the Jesuits at his local college, before transferring to Genoa. In 1630 he narrowly survived an outbreak of plague, which killed his mother.

Some time between 1632 and 1636, Benedetto decided to move to Rome and then Naples in order to study civil law. This led to his securing the offices of protonotary apostolic, president of the Apostolic Camera, commissary of the Marco di Roma, and governor of Macerata; on 6 March 1645, Pope Innocent X (1644–55) made him Cardinal-Deacon with the deaconry of &quot;Santi Cosma e Damiano&quot;. He subsequently became legate to Ferrara. When he was sent to Ferrara in order to assist the people stricken with a severe famine, the Pope introduced him to the people of Ferrara as the &quot;father of the poor&quot;.
In 1650, Odescalchi became bishop of Novara, in which capacity he spent all the revenues of his see to relieve the poor and sick in his diocese. He participated in the 1655 conclave. In 1656, with the pope&#x27;s permission, he resigned as bishop of Novara in favor of his brother Giulio and moved to Rome. While there he took a prominent part in the consultations of the various congregations of which he was a member. He participated in the 1669–70 conclave.

==Papacy==

===Election===

Odescalchi was a strong papal candidate after the death of Pope Clement IX (1667–69) in 1669, but the French government rejected him (using the now-abolished veto). After Pope Clement X (1670–76) died, Louis XIV of France (1643–1715) again intended to use his royal influence against Odescalchi&#x27;s election. Instead, believing that the cardinals as well as the Roman people were of one mind in their desire to have Odescalchi as their Pope, Louis reluctantly instructed the French party cardinals to acquiesce in his candidacy.

On 21 September 1676, Odescalchi was chosen to be Clement X&#x27;s successor and took the name of Innocent XI. He chose this name in honour of Pope Innocent X, who made him a cardinal in 1645. He was formally crowned as pontiff on 4 October 1676 by the protodeacon, Cardinal Francesco Maidalchini.

===Reforming the administration of the papacy===
Immediately upon his accession, Innocent XI turned all his efforts towards reducing the expenses of the Curia. He passed strict ordinances against nepotism among the cardinals. He lived very parsimoniously and exhorted the cardinals to do the same. In this manner he not only squared the annual deficit which at his accession had reached the sum of 170,000 scudi, but within a few years the papal income was even in excess of the expenditures. He lost no time in declaring and practically manifesting his zeal as a reformer of manners and a corrector of administrative abuses. Beginning with the clergy, he sought to raise the laity also to a higher moral standard of living. He closed all of the theaters in Rome (considered to be centers of vice and immorality) and famously brought a temporary halt to the flourishing traditions of Roman opera. In 1679 he publicly condemned sixty-five propositions, taken chiefly from the writings of Escobar, Suarez and other casuists (mostly Jesuit casuists, who had been heavily attacked by Pascal in his &quot;Provincial Letters&quot;) as &quot;propositiones laxorum moralistarum&quot; and forbade anyone to teach them under penalty of excommunication. He condemned in particular the most radical form of mental reservation (&quot;stricte mentalis&quot;) which authorised deception without an outright lie.

Personally not unfriendly to Miguel de Molinos, Innocent XI nevertheless yielded to the enormous pressure brought to bear upon him to confirm in 1687 the judgement of the inquisitors by which sixty-eight quietist propositions of Molinos were condemned as blasphemous and heretical.

===Jewish relations===
Innocent XI showed a degree of sensitivity in his dealings with the Jews within the Italian states. He compelled the Republic of Venice to release the Jewish prisoners taken by Francesco Morosini in 1685. He also discouraged compulsory baptisms which accordingly became less frequent under his pontificate, but he could not abolish the old practice altogether.

More controversially on 30 October 1682 he issued an edict by which all the money-lending activities carried out by the Roman Jews were to cease. Such a move would incidentally have financially benefitted his own brothers who played a dominant role in European money-lending. However, ultimately convinced that such a measure would cause much misery in destroying livelihoods, the enforcement of the edict was twice delayed.

==Foreign relations==

===The Battle of Vienna===

Innocent XI was an enthusiastic initiator of the Holy League which brought together the states of the Holy Roman Empire and King John III Sobieski of Poland-Lithuania who in 1683 hastened to the relief of Vienna which was being besieged by the Turks. After the siege was raised, Innocent XI again spared no efforts to induce the Christian princes to lend a helping hand for the expulsion of the Turks from Ottoman Hungary. He contributed millions of scudi to the Turkish war fund in Austria and Hungary and had the satisfaction of hearing of the capture of Belgrade on 6 September 1688.

===Pope-burning in London===

During England&#x27;s Exclusion Crisis (1679–1681), when Parliament sought to exclude the Catholic Duke of York from gaining the throne,
the radical Protestants of London&#x27;s Green Ribbon Club regularly held mass processions culminating with burning &quot;The Pope&quot; in effigy. Evidently, the organizers of these events were unaware that the actual Pope in Rome was involved in a deep conflict with the King of France – and therefore, far from supporting the drive to get the Duke of York crowned, which served Louis XIV&#x27;s political ambitions.

===Relations with France===

The pontificate of Innocent XI was marked by the struggle between the absolutism and hegemonic intentions of Louis XIV, and the primacy of the Catholic Church. As early as 1673, Louis had by his own power extended the right of the &quot;régale&quot; over the provinces of Languedoc, Guyenne, Provence, and Dauphiné, where it had previously not been exercised.

All the efforts of Innocent XI to induce Louis XIV to respect the rights and primacy of the Church proved useless. In 1682, the King convoked an assembly of the French clergy which adopted the four articles that became known as the Gallican Liberties. Innocent XI annulled the four articles on 11 April 1682, and refused his approbation to all future episcopal candidates who had taken part in the assembly.

To appease the Pope, Louis XIV began to act as a zealot of Catholicism. In 1685, he revoked the Edict of Nantes and inaugurated a persecution of French Huguenots. Innocent expressed displeasure at these drastic measures and continued to withhold his approbation from the episcopal candidates.

Innocent XI irritated the King still more that same year by abolishing the much abused right of asylum, by which foreign ambassadors in Rome had been able to harbor in embassies any criminal wanted by the papal court of justice. He notified the new French ambassador, Marquis de Lavardin, that he would not be recognised as ambassador in Rome unless he renounced this right, but Louis XIV would not give it up. At the head of an armed force of about 800 men Lavardin entered Rome in November 1687, and took forcible possession of his palace. Innocent XI treated him as excommunicated and on 24 December 1687 placed under interdict the Church of St. Louis at Rome where Lavardin attended services.

In January 1688, Innocent XI received the diplomatic mission which had been dispatched to France and the Holy See by Narai, the King of Siam, under Guy Tachard and Ok-khun Chamnan in order to establish relations.

===Cologne controversy===

The tension between the Pope and the King of France was increased by Innocent&#x27;s procedure in filling the vacant archiepiscopal see of Cologne. The two candidates for the see were Cardinal Wilhelm Egon von Fürstenberg, then Bishop of Strasbourg, and Joseph Clemens, a brother of Max Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria. The former was a willing tool in the hands of Louis XIV and his appointment as Archbishop and Prince-elector of Cologne would have implied French preponderance in north-western Germany.

Joseph Clement was not only the candidate of Emperor Leopold I (1658–1705) but of all European rulers, with the exception of the King of France and his supporter and cousin, King James II of England (1685–88). At the election, which took place on 19 July 1688, neither of the candidates received the required number of votes. The decision, therefore, fell to Innocent XI, who designated Joseph Clemens as Archbishop and Elector of Cologne.

Louis XIV retaliated by taking possession of the papal territory of Avignon, imprisoning the papal nuncio and appealing to a general council. Nor did he conceal his intention to separate the French Church entirely from Rome. The Pope remained firm. The subsequent fall of James II in England destroyed French preponderance in Europe and soon after Innocent XI&#x27;s death the struggle between Louis XIV and the papacy was settled in favour of the Church.

===Innocent XI and William of Orange===
Innocent XI dispatched Ferdinando d&#x27;Adda as nuncio to the Kingdom of England, the first representative of the Papacy to go to England for over a century. Even so, the Pope did not approve the imprudent manner in which James II attempted to restore Catholicism in England. He also repeatedly expressed his displeasure at the support which James II gave to the autocratic King Louis XIV in his measures against the Church. It is not surprising, therefore, that Innocent XI had less sympathy for James than for William of Orange and that he did not afford James help in his hour of trial. Innocent refused to appoint James II&#x27;s choice as a Cardinal, Sir Edward Petre, 3rd Baronet.

==Moral theology==
===Abortion===
Innocent XI issued the papal bull &quot;Sanctissimus Dominus&quot; in 1679 to condemn 65 propositions that favored a liberal approach to doctrine which included two that related to abortion. He first condemned proposition 34 and countered that it was unlawful to procure abortion. He also condemned proposition 35, which stated: &quot;It seems probable that the fetus (as long as it is in the uterus) lacks a rational soul and begins first to have one when it is born; and consequently it must be said that no abortion is a homicide.&quot;

==Other activities==
Innocent XI was no less intent on preserving the purity of faith and morals among all people. He insisted on thorough education and an exemplary lifestyle for all people and he passed strict rules in relation to the modesty of dress among Roman women. Furthermore, he put an end to the ever-increasing passion for gambling by suppressing the gambling houses at Rome. By a decree of 12 February 1679 he encouraged frequent and even daily reception of Holy Communion. On 4 March 1679, he condemned the proposition that &quot;the precept of keeping Holy Days is not obligatory under pain of mortal sin, aside from scandal, if contempt is absent&quot;. In 1688, he reiterated a decree of Pope Sixtus V that banned women from singing on stage in all public theatres or opera houses.

Innocent XI was hostile towards the book &quot;Varia Opuscula Theologica&quot; (Various Theological Brochures) that the Spanish Jesuit Francisco Suárez published. He ordered all copies to be burnt in 1679 but his orders went ignored. One of the books was discovered in 2015.

=== Consistories ===

He elevated 43 new cardinals into the cardinalate in two consistories. In 1681 he named Antonio Pignatelli as a cardinal, who would later become Pope Innocent XII (taking his name in honor of the pope who elevated him). Innocent XI also intended to nominate his confessor Ludovico Marracci as a cardinal, but he declined the invitation.

=== Beatifications and canonizations ===
He also canonized two saints: Bernard of Menthon in 1681 and Pedro Armengol on 8 April 1687. He beatified six individuals.

==Death and beatification==

===Final days and death===
Innocent XI is known to have suffered from kidney stones since 1682 and in 1689 his health declined notably. In June that year he was confined to his bed. For reasons of ill health, he cancelled a consistory of cardinals convoked for 19 June for the examination of bishops and he also cancelled meetings on 21 June. The pope was suddenly assailed by a strong fever on 25 June and on 29 June he was unable to celebrate the solemn Mass for the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul, deputing Cardinal Flavio Chigi to celebrate it in his place. The Pope&#x27;s condition worsened on 2 July and his doctors were led to lance his left leg, which caused fluid release, and eventually to undertake an operation on his right leg on 31 July, and two more in the following two days.

On 9 August he received the Viaticum since doctors were of the opinion that he had little time left to live. On 11 August he received in audience Cardinal Leandro Colloredo, who came to remind him that the pope had been set to raise ten men to the cardinalate but the pope refused to do so despite the cardinal&#x27;s insistence. On the morning of 12 August he lost the ability to speak and suffered from breathing difficulties.

Innocent XI died on 12 August 1689 at 22:00 (Rome time) Following his death, he was buried in St Peter&#x27;s Basilica beneath his funeral monument near the Clementine Chapel, which his nephew, Prince Livio Odescalchi, commissioned. The monument, which was designed and sculpted by Pierre-Étienne Monnot, features the pope seated upon the throne above a sarcophagus with a base-relief showing the liberation of Vienna from the Turks by John III Sobieski, flanked by two allegorical figures representing Faith and Fortitude.

In April 2011 the remains of Innocent XI were moved to make way for remains of the beatified John Paul II.

===Beatification===

The process of Innocent XI&#x27;s beatification was introduced in 1691 by Pope Innocent XII. His cause was formally opened on 23 June 1714 under Clement XI, granting him the title of Servant of God, and continued under Clement XII, but French influence and the accusation of Jansenism caused it to be suspended in 1744 by Pope Benedict XIV. In the 20th century, it was reintroduced; his writings were approved by theologians on 24 March 1945, and Pope Pius XII proclaimed him venerable on 15 November 1955 and blessed on 7 October 1956.

Following his beatification, his sarcophagus was placed under the Altar of St. Sebastian in the basilica&#x27;s Chapel of St. Sebastian, where it remained until 8 April 2011 when it was moved to make way for the remains of Pope John Paul II to be relocated to the basilica from the grotto beneath St. Peter&#x27;s in honor of his beatification and in order to make his resting place more accessible to the public. Innocent&#x27;s body was transferred to the basilica&#x27;s Altar of Transfiguration, which is located near the Clementine Chapel and the entombed remains of Pope Gregory the Great (590–604). The altar is also across from Innocent XI&#x27;s monument, which was his original site of burial before his beatification.

The feast day assigned to Innocent XI is 12 August, the date of his death. In the Hungarian calendar, it is commemorated on August 13.

Popular revelations made in the novel &quot;Imprimatur&quot; damaged Innocent XI&#x27;s reputation and thus the planned canonisation of Benedetto Odescalchi was suspended indefinitely.

It was believed that the canonization would have taken place in 2003 but the book&#x27;s publication halted all plans to canonize Innocent XI.

<text>A pantograph (, from their original use for copying writing) is a mechanical linkage connected in a manner based on parallelograms so that the movement of one pen, in tracing an image, produces identical movements in a second pen. If a line drawing is traced by the first point, an identical, enlarged, or miniaturized copy will be drawn by a pen fixed to the other. Using the same principle, different kinds of pantographs are used for other forms of duplication in areas such as sculpting, minting, engraving, and milling.

== History ==
The ancient Greek engineer Hero of Alexandria described pantographs in his work &quot;Mechanics&quot;.

In 1603, Christoph Scheiner used a pantograph to copy and scale diagrams, and wrote about the invention over 27 years later, in &quot;Pantographice seu Ars delineandi res quaslibet per parallelogrammum lineare seu cavum&quot; (Rome 1631). One arm of the pantograph contained a small pointer, while the other held a drawing implement, and by moving the pointer over a diagram, a copy of the diagram was drawn on another piece of paper. By changing the positions of the arms in the linkage between the pointer arm and drawing arm, the scale of the image produced can be changed.

In 1821, Professor William Wallace (1768–1843) invented the eidograph to improve upon the practical utility of the pantograph. The eidograph relocates the fixed point to the center of the parallelogram and uses a narrow parallelogram to provide improved mechanical advantages.

== Uses ==

=== Drafting ===

The original use of the pantograph was for copying and scaling line drawings. Modern versions are sold as technical toys.

=== Sculpture and minting ===

Sculptors use a three-dimensional version of the pantograph, usually a large boom connected to a fixed point at one end, bearing two rotating pointing needles at arbitrary points along this boom. By adjusting the needles different enlargement or reduction ratios can be achieved. This device, now largely overtaken by computer guided router systems that scan a model and can produce it in a variety of materials and in any desired size, was invented by inventor and steam pioneer James Watt and perfected by Benjamin Cheverton in 1836. Cheverton&#x27;s machine was fitted with a rotating cutting bit to carve reduced versions of well-known sculptures. A three-dimensional pantograph can also be used to enlarge sculpture by interchanging the position of the model and the copy.

Another version is still very much in use to reduce the size of large relief designs for coins down to the required size of the coin.

=== Acoustic cylinder duplication ===
One advantage of phonograph and gramophone discs over cylinders in the 1890s—before electronic amplification was available—was that large numbers of discs could be stamped quickly and cheaply. In 1890, the only ways of manufacturing copies of a master cylinder were to mold the cylinders (which was slow and, early on, produced very poor copies), or to acoustically copy the sound by placing the horns of two phonographs together or to hook the two together with a rubber tube (one phonograph recording and the other playing the cylinder back). Instead of copying a master cylinder, the other alternative was to record a performance to multiple gramophones simultaneously, over and over again, making each cylinder a master copy. Edison, Bettini, Leon Douglass and others solved this problem (partly) by mechanically linking a cutting stylus and a playback stylus together and copying the &quot;hill-and-dale&quot; grooves of the cylinder mechanically. When molding improved somewhat, molded cylinders were used as pantograph masters. This was employed by Edison and Columbia in 1898, and was used until about January 1902 (Columbia brown waxes after this were molded). Some companies like the United States Phonograph Company of Newark, New Jersey, supplied cylinder masters for smaller companies so that they could duplicate them, sometimes pantographically. Pantographs could turn out about 30 records per day and produce up to about 150 records per master. In theory, pantograph masters could be used for 200 or 300 duplicates if the master and the duplicate were running in reverse and the record would be duplicated in reverse. This, in theory, could extend the usability of a pantograph master by using the unworn/lesser worn part of the recording for duplication. Pathé employed this system with mastering their vertically cut records until 1923; a , master cylinder, rotating at a high speed, would be recorded on. This was done as the resulting cylinder was considerably loud and of very high fidelity. Then, the cylinder would be placed on the mandrel of a duplicating pantograph that would be played with a stylus on the end of a lever, which would transfer the sound to a wax disc master, which would be electroplated and be used to stamp copies out. This system resulted in some fidelity reduction and rumble, but relatively high quality sound. Edison Diamond Disc Records were made by recording &quot;directly&quot; onto the wax master disc.

=== Milling machines ===


Before the advent of control technologies such as numerical control (NC and CNC) and programmable logic control (PLC), duplicate parts being milled on a milling machine could not have their contours mapped out by moving the milling cutter in a &quot;connect-the-dots&quot; (&quot;by-the-numbers&quot;) fashion. The only ways to control the movement of the cutting tool were to dial the positions by hand using dexterous skill (with natural limits on a human&#x27;s accuracy and precision) or to trace a cam, template, or model in some way, and have the cutter mimic the movement of the tracing stylus. If the milling head was mounted on a pantograph, a duplicate part could be cut (and at various scales of magnification besides 1:1) simply by tracing a template. (The template itself was usually made by a tool and die maker using toolroom methods, including milling via dialing followed by hand sculpting with files and/or die grinder points.) This was essentially the same concept as reproducing documents with a pen-equipped pantograph, but applied to the machining of hard materials such as metal, wood, or plastic. Pantograph routing, which is conceptually identical to pantograph milling, also exists (as does CNC routing). The Blanchard lathe, a copying lathe developed by Thomas Blanchard, used the same essential concept.

The development and dissemination throughout industry of NC, CNC, PLC, and other control technologies provided a new way to control the movement of the milling cutter: via feeding information from a program to actuators (servos, selsyns, leadscrews, machine slides, spindles, and so on) that would move the cutter as the information directed. Today most commercial machining is done via such programmable, computerized methods. Home machinists are likely to work via manual control, but computerized control has reached the home-shop level as well (it is just not yet as pervasive as its commercial counterparts). Thus pantograph milling machines are largely a thing of the past. They are still in commercial use, but at a greatly reduced and ever-dwindling level. They are no longer built new by machine tool builders, but a small market for used machines still exists. As for the magnification-and-reduction feature of a pantograph (with the scale determined by the adjustable arm lengths), it is achieved in CNC via mathematic calculations that the computer applies to the program information practically instantaneously. Scaling functions (as well as mirroring functions) are built into languages such as G-code.

=== Other uses ===

In another application similar to drafting, the pantograph is incorporated into a pantograph engraving machine with a revolving cutter instead of a pen, and a tray at the pointer end to fix precut lettered plates (referred to as &#x27;copy&#x27;), which the pointer follows and thus the cutter, via the pantograph, reproduces the &#x27;copy&#x27; at a ratio to which the pantograph arms have been set. The typical range of ratio is Maximum 1:1 Minimum 50:1 (reduction) In this way machinists can neatly and accurately engrave numbers and letters onto a part. Pantographs are no longer commonly used in modern engraving, with computerized laser and rotary engraving taking favor.

The device which maintains electrical contact with the contact wire and transfers power from the wire to the traction unit, used in electric locomotives and trams, is also called a &quot;pantograph&quot;.

Herman Hollerith&#x27;s &quot;Keyboard punch&quot; used for the 1890 U.S. Census was a pantograph design and sometimes referred to as &quot;The Pantograph Punch&quot;.

An early 19th-century device employing this mechanism is the polygraph, which produces a duplicate of a letter as the original is written.

In 1886, Eduard Selling patented a prize-winning calculating machine based on the pantograph, although it was not commercially successful.

Longarm quilting machine operators may trace a pantograph, paper pattern, with a laser pointer to stitch a custom pattern onto the quilt. Digitized pantographs are followed by computerized machines.

Linn Boyd Benton invented a pantographic engraving machine for type design, which was capable not only of scaling a single font design pattern to a variety of sizes, but could also condense, extend, and slant the design (mathematically, these are cases of affine transformation, which is the fundamental geometric operation of most systems of digital typography today, including PostScript).

Richard Feynman used the analogy of a pantograph as a way of scaling down tools to the nanometer scale in his talk &quot;There&#x27;s Plenty of Room at the Bottom&quot;.

<doc id="24653" wikidata="Q186572" url="?curid=24653" title="Princess Mononoke">
<text>is a 1997 Japanese animated historical fantasy film written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki. Set in the Muromachi period of Japanese history, the film follows Ashitaka, a young Emishi prince who journeys west to cure his cursed arm and becomes embroiled in the conflict between Irontown and the forest of the gods, as well as the feud between Lady Eboshi and a human girl raised by wolves named San. Produced by Toshio Suzuki, animated by Studio Ghibli, and distributed by Toho, it stars the voices of Yōji Matsuda, Yuriko Ishida, Yūko Tanaka, Kaoru Kobayashi, Masahiko Nishimura, Tsunehiko Kamijō, Akihiro Miwa, Mitsuko Mori, and Hisaya Morishige.

Miyazaki began developing early concepts in 1980 and later considered basing a film on the Japanese literary classic the (1212); elements of both evolved substantially into the eventual film. After taking a break to direct &quot;On Your Mark&quot;(1995), he led the production with a budget of , making it the most expensive animated film at the time. Some computer-generated imagery and other digital techniques were used in conjunction with hand-drawn animation, a first for Miyazaki. The film explores themes of environmentalism and societal diversity, partly inspired by Miyazaki&#x27;s readings into novel historical and cultural studies, and presents a feminist portrayal of its characters. It also blends fantastical elements with its depiction of medieval Japanese history, influenced by the style. The score was composed by Joe Hisaishi, a longtime collaborator of Miyazaki&#x27;s.

&quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; was theatrically released in Japan on July 12, 1997, breaking several box office records and attracting large audiences. Suzuki led the film&#x27;s marketing, then the largest advertisement campaign in Japan. It eventually became the highest-grossing film in the country. Following a distribution deal struck between Tokuma Shoten and Walt Disney Studios, it was the first of Studio Ghibli&#x27;s films to be released internationally and was given to Miramax Films to be dubbed into English and distributed in North America. Neil Gaiman wrote the translation, making significant alterations for its American audience; the dub underperformed at the box office. , the film has grossed through various theatrical and home media releases. It received a broadly positive critical response in both Japan and the United States and earned a number of major Japanese accolades, including top awards at the Mainichi Film Awards and the Japan Academy Film Prize. Its sustained popularity and cultural impact have since made it a cult film.

== Plot summary ==

In Muromachi-era Japan, the last Emishi prince, Ashitaka, kills a gigantic demon to protect his village, but his arm is afflicted by its curse. The demon, once the boar god Nago, was corrupted by an iron ball embedded in its body. Learning that the curse will eventually kill him, Ashitaka is exiled to the west, seeking a cure by uncovering the source of Nago&#x27;s hatred.

On his journey, Ashitaka discovers that the curse grants him supernatural strength. He encounters a monk named Jigo, who advises him to seek answers in the nearby mountains from the Forest Spirit– a deer-like god of life and death that transforms into the giant Nightwalker at sunset. Guided by tiny , Ashitaka passes through the forest of the gods, where he catches a glimpse of the Forest Spirit. Meanwhile, a group of men led by Lady Eboshi repel an attack by a pack of wolves led by the goddess Moro and her adopted human daughter, San.

Ashitaka arrives at Irontown, a settlement that has deforested the surrounding area to mine iron, leading to conflicts with the animal gods of the forest. However, the town shelters former prostitutes and people with leprosy, who work to manufacture firearms. Eboshi, the town&#x27;s leader, admits to shooting Nago, instilling the hatred that corrupted him. She also reveals her plan to kill the Forest Spirit, hoping to eradicate the gods and enable Irontown to prosper. Though Ashitaka&#x27;s cursed arm tries attacking Eboshi, he resists its influence. Eboshi is collaborating with Jigo, who stands to be richly rewarded for delivering the Forest Spirit&#x27;s head– believed to grant immortality– to the Emperor.

The wolves attack; San infiltrates Irontown and duels Eboshi. Ashitaka subdues them both, but a townsperson shoots him. Strengthened by the curse, he takes San out of the town before collapsing. San threatens to kill him for sparing Eboshi, but is taken aback when he compliments her beauty. She brings Ashitaka to the Forest Spirit, who heals his wound but leaves the curse. The next day, a boar clan, led by the blind god Okkoto, declares their intention to attack Irontown, preferring to die in battle rather than allow their kind to diminish. Ashitaka recovers and implores Moro to let San escape with him, but is banished from the forest instead.

The boars assault Irontown&#x27;s forces but are annihilated by their weaponry. San and the mortally wounded Okkoto retreat to the forest, unknowingly followed by Eboshi and Jigo, who use the blood of the fallen boars to deceive Okkoto into leading them to the Forest Spirit. San tries stopping him, but his pain transforms him into a demon, engulfing her. With Moro&#x27;s remaining strength, she and Ashitaka free San. The Forest Spirit grants peaceful deaths to Okkoto and Moro. As it transforms into the Nightwalker, Eboshi beheads it. Its body explodes into a dark, chaotic fluid that expands in search of its head, killing everything it touches– including the forest– and briefly reanimates Moro&#x27;s head, which bites off Eboshi&#x27;s arm.

Though reluctant to help the humans, San joins Ashitaka in pursuing Jigo to recover the Forest Spirit&#x27;s head. Ashitaka evacuates Irontown as the Nightwalker&#x27;s body floods it, and together, he and San retrieve the head from Jigo, returning it to the Nightwalker. As the sun rises, the Nightwalker dies and dissolves into the wind. In its place, the devastated land is renewed with abundant flora, and Ashitaka&#x27;s curse is lifted. A repentant Eboshi resolves to build a better town. While Ashitaka chooses to help with Irontown&#x27;s reconstruction, San, unable to forgive humanity, stays in the forest. They promise to meet as often as they can.

== Development ==

=== Early concepts and pre-production ===

Hayao Miyazaki composed the preliminary ideas for what would become &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; in 1980 after releasing his first film, &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot;(1979), drawing sketches of a princess living in the woods with a beast. The story was roughly based on the &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;(1740) fairy tale, set in historical Japan. The Beast was realized as an animalistic spirit ( whom the protagonist, the daughter of a nobleman, is forced to marry. After unsuccessfully proposing the film project to several production companies, Miyazaki published his concepts in a book in 1983, republished in 2014 as &quot;Princess Mononoke: The First Story&quot;. He reused various ideas from this project in works such as &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;(1988) and &quot;Porco Rosso&quot;(1992). &quot;Shuna&#x27;s Journey&quot;(1983) in particular bears the closest resemblance to the eventual film, featuring a protagonist who rides an elk to the land of gods. A few fundamental ideas from the 1980 concept appear in the final film, but the character designs and plot are entirely different. The film scholar Raz Greenberg wrote that the original concept also the end of tyranny vividly&quot;, in contrast with the film, showing the antagonist&#x27;s fortress destroyed and its slaves emancipated. According to the film scholar Rayna Denison, the stark difference between the original idea and the final film demonstrates the radical change of Miyazaki&#x27;s filmmaking philosophies during that time. He took cues from Japanese folklore, especially the tale of a princess with a birthmark, which evolved over time into Ashitaka&#x27;s curse.

Inspired by the writings of Yoshie Hotta, Miyazaki also considered creating a film adaptation of the (1212), a Japanese literary classic on the ephemerality of life. It was written by the poet Kamo no Chōmei during a period of political turmoil and natural disasters, which the animation scholar Susan J. Napier felt resonated with the &quot;increasing sense of vulnerability&quot; in Japanese culture during the time of the film&#x27;s production. However, Miyazaki felt the concept was &quot;far removed from common sense&quot; and had no possibility of commercial success; he never moved forward with this concept but continued to consider creating a historical piece. Upon the completion of his manga series &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;(1982–1994), Miyazaki began work on the project proposal for the film in August 1994. However, encountering writer&#x27;s block in December, he took a break from the production to direct the short film &quot;On Your Mark&quot;(1995) as a side project. Miyazaki returned to the film in April 1995 and began working on the storyboards in May. The film&#x27;s broad scope and high level of detail extended the pre-production process. That month, Miyazaki took four of the art directors to visit the island of Yakushima, which had already inspired some environments in &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot;, to achieve the environmental depiction that he was seeking to portray. The island&#x27;s relative lack of development informed their sketches of the film&#x27;s forest of the gods. The fifth art director, Kazuo Oga, went to the Shirakami-Sanchi mountains to draw inspiration for the Emishi village.

=== Production and animation ===

&quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; was the most expensive animated film ever produced in Japan at the time. It was originally allocated a budget of , which was expanded to later in the production, more than double that of any previous Studio Ghibli film. Miyazaki stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t care if the studio goes bankrupt.&quot; The animation production commenced in July 1995. Miyazaki created the storyboards using the approach he took toward serialized manga, writing the film&#x27;s plot as he drew the scenes. His declining sight initially caused him to use oversized paper, but he switched back to the normal size to increase the pace of the storyboarding. This process was done in parallel with the animation, and the final boards outlining the end of the film were not finished until January 1997.

An unusually high level of detail was afforded illustrating backgrounds and animating background characters due to the large budget available. The decision to assign five art directors to the film was also unprecedented. Each tackled a different aspect; for example, one handled daylight shots while another covered the nighttime. The film used approximately 144,000 cels, 80,000 of them being key animation frames, more than any other Studio Ghibli film. Miyazaki is estimated to have drawn or retouched nearly 80,000 cels himself. The final shots were completed in June 1997, less than a month from the release date.

=== Computer graphics ===

The film was created using a combination of hand-drawn animation and computer-generated imagery; approximately five minutes were animated entirely using digital processes. A further ten minutes use digital ink and paint, a technique used in all subsequent Studio Ghibli films. The company&#x27;s hand-drawn methods were becoming outdated by the late 1990s, and by 1997, members of Studio Ghibli&#x27;s computer graphics team felt that the adoption was made largely out of necessity. According to Mamoru Oshii– a contemporary of Miyazaki&#x27;s– digital painting was adopted at the insistence of Michiyo Yasuda, a senior colorist at Studio Ghibli. While Studio Ghibli had already begun experimenting with digital techniques a few years prior on &quot;Pom Poko&quot;(1994), its computer graphics department was opened during the production of &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;.

Miyazaki&#x27;s distaste for digital animation techniques was well known in Japan before the film&#x27;s release, so his use of computer graphics came as a surprise, according to Denison. He made the decision to use the new techniques early in the production, starting with the demon god in the opening sequence. Certain sequences were created using 3D tools and then processed to resemble a traditionally animated sequence using a program called Toon Shader, developed by Microsoft at the studio&#x27;s request. Some of this work was outsourced to the animation studio Toyo Links. Three broad categories of digital techniques were applied to the animation: the use of digital ink and paint to finish coloring hand-drawn frames; 3D rendering and digital compositing, which put the hand-drawn images in a three-dimensional environment to create more visual depth; and morphing and particle effects, which create additional detail and smoother transitions. , the head of the computer graphics department, recalled that the most involved uses of digital techniques were to mask the transitions between the digital and hand-drawn elements on screen. Some characters, particularly the gods, alternate between rendering approaches in different shots.

== Themes ==


=== Conflicts of nature, technology, and humanity ===

Environmentalism is a central theme of &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;. In the war between the forest gods and the people of Irontown, Ashitaka serves as the mediator. Unlike many Western works with similar themes, the film does not present these positions as complete opposites, nor does it outright reject modernity and technology. The scholars Tracey Daniels-Lerberg and Matthew Lerberg wrote that it instead the unpredictable outcomes that emerge in the uncertainty that remains.&quot; Both humanity and nature are given equal standing in the film&#x27;s world, and Napier wrote that the film &quot;offers a vision of life as a densely interwoven design, rather than a simple allegory of dichotomized opposites.&quot; Additionally, the film portrays internal strife within parties on both sides of the conflict: the different clans of spirits disagree on how to handle the conflict, and the humans war amongst themselves for various reasons. Ashitaka&#x27;s relationships with both parties are volatile and &quot;even dissatisfying at moments&quot;, according to Daniels-Lerberg and Lerberg. They attribute this sense of unease to the focus on emotion, rather than strict logic, that the film puts on the conflict. According to the film critic Roger Ebert, &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; is not a &quot;simplistic tale of good and evil, but the story of how humans, forest animals, and nature gods all fight for their share of the new emerging order.&quot;

The film scholars Colin Odell and Michelle Le Blanc wrote that the film simultaneously mounts a criticism of humanity&#x27;s mistreatment of the natural world and &quot;grudgingly admits&quot; that some disputes are inevitable to facilitate technological progress. While Irontown is shown to be a haven for downtrodden members of society, who have the opportunity to live honest lives and enjoy fair treatment from Eboshi, the conflict arises from the harm that the settlement causes to the surrounding environment. Greenberg identified this dynamic as a marked increase in complexity from Miyazaki&#x27;s earlier works, which typically presented a utopian model as an answer to social issues. Miyazaki expressed that he &quot;meant to state [his] objection to the way environmental issues are treated&quot;, referring to the general exclusion of humanity&#x27;s role in environmental discourse in Japan. The ecological writings of the historian , especially his &quot;evergreen forest culture theory&quot;, were greatly influential on Miyazaki when creating the film&#x27;s forest of the gods. Miyazaki stated that book] taught me what I was the descendent of&quot;, and provided him an alternative to many traditional depictions of Japanese history that he disliked.

Napier saw the film as an &quot;elegy for a lost Japan&quot;, a version of the country that predates the modern patriarchal society and was controlled by nature. Setting the film in the Muromachi period allowed Miyazaki to depict the country before it had been deforested and altered by rice agriculture and positions the film within the moment of history when &quot;humankind pushed nature into submission&quot;, according to the animation writers Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy. Miyazaki intended to portray the gods as &quot;living animals, tortured by humans&quot;, feeling it to be an important aspect to depict in the relationship between nature and humanity. He was inspired for the film&#x27;s concept by the Epic of Gilgamesh(2100–1200 BCE), an ancient epic poem that depicts the death of the forest god and the ruin of humanity. The philosopher Takeshi Umehara, who wrote a stage play titled &quot;Gilgamesh&quot;(1988), had previously suggested that Miyazaki adapt his work into a film; Miyazaki had declined the offer at the time but later stated that he had unconsciously included elements similar to the play in &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;. The film shares several themes with the &quot;Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind&quot; manga, which Miyazaki had completed in 1994, namely the &quot;environmental catastrophe, the role of technology and warfare, and human interactions with nonhuman species&quot;, according to Napier. Clements and McCarthy wrote that the film was conceived partly due to Miyazaki&#x27;s discontent with the narrative of the manga&#x27;s film adaptation(1984), in which the environmental theme was suddenly resolved via a &quot;deus ex machina&quot;.

Miyazaki&#x27;s filmmaking style changed considerably in the 1990s in response to various geopolitical conflicts, including the Gulf War and the Yugoslav Wars following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. He was especially critical of Japan&#x27;s decision to provide military aid in the Gulf War, which he considered a violation of Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution. These events disheartened Miyazaki, who compared them to the preamble to World War I and felt he was watching history repeat itself. In 1995, two disasters occurred in Japan that had a marked negative impact on its culture: the Great Hanshin earthquake, which killed thousands and became the worst on record since 1923, and the Tokyo subway sarin attack perpetrated by the Aum Shinrikyo cult. Napier wrote that these had an effect &quot;on both a psychological and an environmental level&quot; and heightened the country&#x27;s cultural &quot;emptiness&quot; following the Japanese asset price bubble bursting in 1992. After finishing &quot;Porco Rosso&quot;, Miyazaki resolved to create a &quot;substantial film&quot; that acknowledged academic discourse, eschewing the escapist philosophy of his earlier works. He instead set out to depict the philosophy that, &quot;no matter how messy things get, we have no choice but to go on living.&quot;

=== Heterogeneity of society ===

Napier wrote that &quot;the sense of a broken heterogeneous world is stridently manifest&quot; within &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;. The film challenges popular cultural beliefs, such as the existence of a homogenous Japanese ethnicity (, by depicting social outcasts and peoples not of Yamato origin. The Emishi people are related to the modern Ainu people, and Miyazaki highlights this difference in the film: Ashitaka is immediately treated as a stranger at many of the villages he visits. The film scholar Eija Niskanen wrote that the film also critiques the , a group of ethnonationalist theories about Japan that claim its culture is unique from others and depict the nation&#x27;s people as uniform. The film scholar Shiro Yoshioka felt that the writing of Yoshihiko Amino, another historical scholar, influenced Miyazaki&#x27;s writing in this regard. According to Denison, his explorations result in highly polarized characters and participants on both sides of the conflict becoming &quot;monstrous&quot;. Miyazaki said that more recent historical studies had increasingly focused on the lifestyles of common people outside the nobility, many of which do not align with the theories of a . He was also inspired to portray people with leprosy after visiting the Tama Zenshoen Sanatorium near his home in Tokyo. He commented afterwards, &quot;In the middle of no matter what kind of misery there is joy and laughter. In human life which tends toward ambiguity, I have never seen a place which shows this with such clarity.&quot;

Napier felt that the film proposes a possible future Japanese identity that highlights non-uniformity and the role of women. Toshio Suzuki– the film&#x27;s producer and a longtime friend of Miyazaki&#x27;s– stated that Miyazaki was a feminist and brought ideals of gender equality to his professional life as well as his fictional works. However, McCarthy felt that his prior portrayals of women were predicated in a fundamentally patriarchal worldview; Miyazaki&#x27;s female characters succeed only when given the opportunity to in a society ultimately governed by men. She argued that the protagonists Ashitaka and San were constructed incrementally through various predecessors in Miyazaki&#x27;s works. His earlier films also portrayed young characters as able and driven to change the world, which is not continued here. San, according to Napier, is an &quot;embodiment of Miyazaki&#x27;s anger with what he increasingly perceived as a stupid and chaotic world.&quot; She also found San&#x27;s early appearance in the film with a bloodstained face to create a vivid image of violence, wildness, and &quot;aggressive sexuality that is confrontational rather than alluring.&quot; McCarthy wrote that San is Miyazaki&#x27;s only female protagonist to be entirely unbound from patriarchy, refusing to accept a domestic life even despite her love for Ashitaka. In a divergence from Miyazaki&#x27;s previous works that close with clearly optimistic outlooks, the film ends in an ambiguous manner; the Forest Spirit&#x27;s death revives nature, but the wild forests remain felled, and Ashitaka and San do not stay together but agree to occasionally meet.

Napier felt that the film&#x27;s conflicting philosophies do not facilitate the inclusion of an antagonist of a similar kind to the Count from &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; or Muska from &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;(1986). Eboshi&#x27;s initial characterization sets her in the role of a villain: the belligerent of the environmental conflict and the cause of Nago&#x27;s demonic corruption. However, this impression is repeatedly challenged by depictions of her leadership and caregiving qualities; the community of Irontown holds sincere respect for her, and her sheltering of former prostitutes and people affected by leprosy contravenes many traditional roles of femininity. Miyazaki&#x27;s depictions of female characters working on iron and people with leprosy manufacturing weapons are considerable departures from historical views. Napier emphasized that the decision to place a female character in this leadership position prevents her stance from being viewed as a cliché of oppressive militarism or the interpretation of technology as inherently detrimental. She wrote that Eboshi can be viewed as a tragic character because she is not evil but is forced to become an aggressor to safeguard her progressive community. Although Eboshi and San represent diametrically opposed views, they share many leadership and nurturing characteristics, and the scholar Alice Vernon examined the relationship between the two as a symbiotic one, where Eboshi represents a possible future image of San.

== Style ==

&quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; marked the first time Miyazaki explored a style– a period drama focusing on the lives of historic Japanese people. He particularly appreciated the works of Akira Kurosawa, who had directed several key films in the genre. The film subverts many traditional elements of the , such as the portrayals of the Emperor and the samurai as sacred and noble. Miyazaki chose not to align with typical depictions of the Muromachi period, such as the development of high culture or Zen aesthetics in the capital city of Kyoto. Napier wrote that the forest of the gods also subverts typical depictions of nature in the Muromachi period; as opposed to carefully tended Zen gardens, it is untamed, violent, and largely avoided by humans. The film exaggerates its historical perspective to facilitate the narrative; Irontown, for example, is inspired primarily by metalworking settlements in China. Miyazaki lacked a historical reference for the Emishi people&#x27;s garments, so the clothing worn by the girls in Ashitaka&#x27;s village is influenced by styles from Bhutan and Thailand, and other characters&#x27; embroidered fabrics resemble traditional Ainu clothing. Instead of traditional arms, guns are the primary weapons in the film&#x27;s conflict. Isao Takahata– a fellow director and longtime friend of Miyazaki&#x27;s– said that the film was &quot;dangerously liable to give the audiences misconceived impressions of history.&quot; Napier wrote that the film goes &quot;beyond realism&quot; to support its themes, and the critic Kazuhiko Komatsu felt that its world, while sometimes consistent with historical fact, is essentially Miyazaki&#x27;s fantasy.

According to Napier, the film presents a much &quot;grimmer&quot; tone than Miyazaki&#x27;s previous works, inspired by the themes of the . She contrasted Miyazaki&#x27;s previous depictions of historical settings to the film&#x27;s rendering of the Muromachi period, which she wrote &quot;refuses to sentimentalize the medieval history it highlights&quot;. The film is unusual in Miyazaki&#x27;s filmography for its lack of flying sequences. Napier suggested that its focus on lateral motion over vertical can be tied to the &quot;sense of entrapment and desperation&quot; it presents. Studio Ghibli had begun hiring full-time animators by the early 1990s, in contrast to the industry standard of staff being employed on short-term contracts. Denison wrote that this helped the studio develop an animated &quot;house style&quot; over time. Miyazaki felt that an important aspect of this style was the studio&#x27;s aptitude for illustrating the natural world; Denison observed from an interview with the art directors that their approach was to &quot;simplify and caricature nature&#x27;s essential meanings&quot;, prioritizing moments of contemplation and mindfulness of the surrounding landscape. The film uses a palette for the forest that contrasts with the pastel colors typically used in Miyazaki films, employing darker shades of green and brown. Napier emphasized that the medium of animation, compared to live action, is well suited for exploring the film&#x27;s themes. The film depicts a number of animals and gods, but she noted that they are entirely distinct from the humans; most notably, the Forest Spirit presents a serene yet entirely foreign visage.

== Release ==

=== Marketing and Japanese release ===

The promotional strategy was spearheaded by Suzuki, who by 1997 had already developed relationships within the media industry while promoting previous Studio Ghibli releases. Napier noted that the marketing put the film under the Studio Ghibli brand for the first time– as opposed to previous works that were labeled primarily as Miyazaki films– which she felt reflected Suzuki&#x27;s rising position as the studio&#x27;s main producer. According to Suzuki, three important elements of the campaign were the repeated use of a recognizable title logo, key imagery from the film, and a tagline. The tagline underwent several iterations before, with Suzuki&#x27;s input, the final phrase was chosen: &quot;Live.&quot; Suzuki also changed the title from the original intention of &quot;The Legend of Ashitaka&quot; without Miyazaki&#x27;s initial approval, as he found it less interesting. The budget allotted for the film&#x27;s promotion was at least , even higher than the production budget, making it the largest film advertisement campaign in Japan at the time. Yoshioka argued that it was essential for &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; to be a commercial success to make up for the large production budget, and the scale of its campaign was significantly expanded from previous films&#x27; as a result. Several types of merchandise, such as stuffed and copies of San&#x27;s mask, were sold. A number of preview screenings were organized before the release to advertise the film by word of mouth; 130 of them were originally scheduled, and 70 were ultimately held, a number that the film scholar Seiji Kanō still found &quot;astonishing&quot;. Miyazaki&#x27;s previous film, &quot;Porco Rosso&quot;, had had only 23 screenings by comparison.

After Walt Disney Studios and Studio Ghibli&#x27;s then–parent company, Tokuma Shoten, secured their distribution deal in 1997, the film would be the first among Miyazaki&#x27;s works to receive a worldwide release. While the arrangement did extend the studio&#x27;s reach to new regions, the announcement was made primarily to attract local audiences. Miyazaki also hinted at his retirement following the film&#x27;s release, further piquing audience interest. The film was marketed as a split between an anime and an art house film, avoiding advertising in the mainstream ahead of its release. Denison felt that this choice was indicative of the studio&#x27;s initial lack of confidence in the film&#x27;s commercial viability and their perception of its financial riskiness. , the president of Tokuma Shoten, said in an interview before the release that it would be a &quot;huge success&quot; just to make back the investments that had been put into the film. Denison argued, however, that the marketing campaign&#x27;s scale revealed the studio&#x27;s ultimate aim to achieve a commercial success; she interpreted this approach as a &quot;local equivalent of the &#x27;calculated&#x27; blockbuster film.&quot;

&quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; was presented by Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television, and Dentsu, and released by Toho in Japan on July 12, 1997. It was the subject of immense public anticipation, and it was screened at 260 of the country&#x27;s 1800 cinemas, many of which reported audiences queueing to purchase tickets in previously unseen numbers. The Japanese specialist magazine &quot;Animage&quot;, which was published by Tokuma Shoten and had been closely associated with Studio Ghibli since the 1980s, released special issues on the film, as did several other publications. Newspapers began to refer to the film&#x27;s release as the &quot;&quot;Mononoke&quot; phenomenon&quot;, as by the end of its first week, the film had brought in over a million viewers and earned at the box office. Advertising for the film labeled it a blockbuster (, and it increasingly competed with many high-profile films in the Japanese market, including Hollywood imports such as &quot;The Lost World: Jurassic Park&quot;(1997). By November, it had surpassed in distribution rental sales, breaking the national record previously held by &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;(1982). During that period, 12million people, a tenth of Japan&#x27;s population at the time, saw the film in theaters. A year after the film&#x27;s release, it had attracted over 14.2million viewers and earned in gross revenue, making it the all-time highest-grossing film in the country.

=== English dub and American release ===

As part of the Disney–Tokuma deal, the film was handed over to Miramax Films, a Disney subsidiary at the time, to dub and distribute in the United States and other regions. The dub was directed by Jack Fletcher, who had previously worked on the dubs of other Studio Ghibli films such as &quot;Kiki&#x27;s Delivery Service&quot;, and its script was written by the fantasy author Neil Gaiman, who was an unusual choice for anime localizations at the time, according to Denison. Gaiman claimed that Harvey Weinstein, who was the head of Miramax at the time, initially offered the role to the film director Quentin Tarantino, who had then recommended Gaiman instead. Gaiman had intended to decline the offer before being impressed by a scene in which a stone wets in the falling rain, saying, &quot;I have never seen anything like this. This is real filmmaking.&quot; Steve Alpert, an executive at Studio Ghibli, assisted with the translation.

Denison wrote that Miramax&#x27;s approach to the dub &quot;might be termed a project of indigenization&quot; with an intent to form a new identity for the film outside of Japan. The language scholar JenniferE. Nicholson wrote that the English dub&#x27;s changes more closely approach an adaptation than a translation. Cultural differences between the United States and Japan, amplified by the film&#x27;s discussion of specifically Japanese elements, resulted in a script that co-mingled the two languages and cultures. Gaiman inserted dialog for off-screen characters elucidating cultural concepts considered obscure for American audiences. Humor in particular demanded significant alterations; Gaiman approached the issue by searching for an &quot;emotional equivalent&quot; for the lines instead of considering the reason the originals were humorous. Gaiman later recalled that although he oversaw the writing process, some script alterations were made without his knowledge. Several of the changes removed terms that identified the setting, such as substituting with &quot;wine&quot; and removing mentions of Japan and China. Nicholson found these decisions indicative of Miramax&#x27;s intent to strip the film of its cultural context and divorce it from history entirely. Gaiman also recalled his drafts receiving contradictory corrections from both Miramax and Studio Ghibli, to which he responded by writing two sets of revisions and asking them to &quot;go fight it out amongst [themselves].&quot;

The film featured a variety of celebrity voice actors who had developed followings in both traditional acting and voice acting roles. Denison wrote that various American and British accents were chosen to further remove elements of Japanese culture and color the film with &quot;the &#x27;American&#x27; voice that narrates it.&quot; The English-language release was marketed primarily as an art house film, and the media scholar Emma Pett felt that choosing the Miramax label rather than the family film–oriented Buena Vista label helped target the film towards a &quot;middlebrow, culturally sophisticated audience&quot; outside the mainstream. By this time, Weinstein had developed a reputation for importing and cutting international films to appeal to domestic audiences. However, among the terms of the distribution deal were that Studio Ghibli would approve and have ultimate control of the translation and that the film would not have any time cut. Weinstein attempted to convince Miyazaki and Suzuki otherwise but was unsuccessful. Gaiman said that Miramax rolled back the planned marketing campaign and opened the film in a very limited number of screens. The English dub was first screened at the 48th Berlin International Film Festival on February 11, 1998, and premiered at the Avery Fisher Hall in New York City on September 26. It underperformed at the American box office, earning only .

=== Home media and other releases ===

The film was released on VHS in Japan by Buena Vista Home Entertainment in 1997 and on LaserDisc by Tokuma Shoten in 1998. Several related books have been published, including a manga series derived from the film&#x27;s cels, art books with early sketches and storyboards, and reference works written by various academics. The English dub was released theatrically in Japan on April 29, 2000, with Japanese-language subtitles. A documentary titled &quot;Mononoke-hime in U.S.A.&quot; was released concurrently. These and other screenings internationally brought the English dub&#x27;s total earnings to at the time. The film has also been released on home media in various European and Asian regions. The DVD release in North America was not initially set to include the Japanese audio track. Online petitions were opened to retain it, and the planned August 2000 release was consequently delayed. Miramax released the DVD on December 19, 2000, featuring the original Japanese audio, the English dub audio, and extras including a trailer and a documentary. &quot;Nikkei Business&quot; reported that 4.4million DVD units were sold in Japan . Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray in 2014, and it was included in a collection of Miyazaki&#x27;s films in 2015. GKIDS re-issued it on DVD and Blu-ray in 2017. , the film has grossed from Blu-ray sales in the United States. It has since been re-screened in several runs around the world, including at the annual Studio Ghibli Fest organized by GKIDS. , the film has grossed a collective worldwide.

== Music ==

As with most of Miyazaki&#x27;s previous films, &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; score was composed by Joe Hisaishi. According to McCarthy, the score&#x27;s development involved a much closer collaboration between the two than on previous works. Hisaishi first composed an image album– a collection of demos and musical sketches that serve as a precursor to the finished score– which he shared with Miyazaki and Suzuki. The unused title &quot;The Legend of Ashitaka&quot; appears here as the title of the opening theme. With their input, the demos were then worked into the final score, performed by the Tokyo City Philharmonic Orchestra. Tokuma Shoten released the image album in July 1996 and the soundtrack album in July 1997. The vocal theme song performed by the countertenor singer Yoshikazu Mera was released as a single before the film&#x27;s release and became popular with Japanese audiences. A third version of the soundtrack, arranged for symphony orchestra and performed by the Czech Philharmonic, was released in 1998. All three albums were issued on vinyl records in 2020.

The vocal theme was re-recorded for the English dub by the American vocalist Sasha Lazard. Denison argued that this was a part of Miramax&#x27;s efforts to remove the film&#x27;s Japanese elements, but she also acknowledged that the score deviates substantially from a typical Hollywood-style compositional approach. For example, leitmotifs, which are commonly used to represent characters or settings, are instead used in transitional moments between more significant narrative events. McCarthy wrote that the film complements the scenes featuring music and dialog with a liberal use of silence and ambient sounds to augment the tension of certain moments, a significant departure from American scoring approaches. The musicology scholar Stacey Jocoy highlighted the emphatic use of brass instruments to accompany the film&#x27;s epic story. Hisaishi employs Japanese pentatonic scales in conjunction with Western tonalities, and Jocoy analyzed the melody featuring this scale in San&#x27;s theme as symbolic of her desire for &quot;peace and beauty&quot;. The contrasting cluster chords– which she found similar to those of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot;(1913)– are used to represent San&#x27;s aggression.

== Reception ==

=== Critical response ===

The film was generally well received by critics in Japan, and Kanō described a &quot;flurry of praise&quot; in the Japanese media following its box office success. &quot;The Asahi Shimbun&quot; Noboru Akiyama felt that the work displayed a &quot;strong artistic quality&quot; and a number of reviews in animation magazines highlighted its visual fidelity. Several publications featured articles from critics and academics covering several aspects of the film&#x27;s production as well as interviews with key staff. According to Yoshioka, a variety of academics were attracted to write about the film due to themes such as Japanese cultural history being relatively &quot;easy topics&quot; to cover, as well as in response to Miyazaki&#x27;s growing status as a public intellectual () within Japanese society. Some scholars speculated on the contributing factors to the film&#x27;s success; a number commented on the reactions of younger audience members, who found the themes relatable to their personal struggles and empathized with its motifs of hope. Napier also wrote that the themes of conflict and coexistence with nature and the spirit world resonated strongly with Japanese viewers. Very few reviews directed criticism at the film, and among them Kanō found many of the comments to be &quot;highly questionable&quot;. Kenichiro Horii of the &quot;Shūkan Bunshun&quot; found the text difficult to parse, and others were disappointed by the fantasy that Miyazaki had constructed. A few critics also faulted the female characters&#x27; lack of sex appeal.

Despite its poor performance in the American box office, the film received widespread praise from critics in the United States. On the review aggregator website Metacritic, the film was assigned a weighted average score of 76 out of 100 based on 29 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, of the critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8 out of 10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;With its epic story and breathtaking visuals, &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; is a landmark in the world of animation.&quot; In 2018, Pett conducted a meta-analysis of 1065 critical reviews published in the United States and the United Kingdom. Initial reviews often discussed the cultural differences that the film would exhibit and the alterations that Miramax had made to the presentation; Ty Burr of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was generally appreciative but felt &quot;very curious to see if American audiences can handle it.&quot; While Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that the film had been &quot;effectively translated[...] without losing its Japanese essence&quot;, Michael Atkinson wrote in &quot;Mr. Showbiz&quot; that &quot;an enormous amount of something or other got lost in the translation.&quot;

Many critics compared the film with the family-oriented works, primarily produced by Disney, which defined audience expectations for animations in the United States. &quot;Variety&quot; Leonard Klady wrote that the film in the face of popular Western animation&quot; by eschewing musical numbers or narratives written to appeal to children. Stephen Hunter commented in an article for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that the animation is &quot;completely vivid and exquisitely detailed&quot;, but lacks the fluidity of Disney&#x27;s works. Critics also highlighted the violence and mature themes as aspects inappropriate for children. Burr and others favorably compared the film&#x27;s fantasy elements with those of &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;(1999)– which had been released a few months prior– and novels such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;(1954–1955) and &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;(1950–1956). Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; considered the film Miyazaki&#x27;s best and recommended it for an Academy Award nomination. In the United Kingdom, however, the film received a very limited number of reviews and was largely panned by critics. Pett and &quot;The Guardian&quot; Andrew Osmond ascribed this to a general negative perception of anime in British society at the time, rooted in controversies caused by some violent and sexually explicit animations.

Several publications have featured &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; in their lists of best films. &quot;Animage&quot; ranked it 47th in their list of the 100 best anime in 2001. &quot;Empire&quot; ranked it 488th on their list of the 500 greatest films and placed it 3rd on their 2024 list of the 50 greatest animated films. It also ranked 13th on &quot;Paste&quot; list of the 100 best anime films and 26th on &quot;Time Out&quot; and &quot;Total Film&quot; lists of the greatest animated films.

=== Accolades ===

Japan submitted &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; for Best Foreign Language Film at the 70th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated.

== Legacy ==

According to Napier, the film is commonly considered to be Miyazaki&#x27;s most significant feature film. She wrote that it marked a &quot;new chapter&quot; in his filmography on account of its nuanced and intermingled themes and the unprecedented scope of its production. The film was longer and more expensive to produce than any Studio Ghibli film up to that point, which Napier reported induced a high level of stress and demanded &quot;almost superhuman efforts&quot; from the entire staff, including Miyazaki. Some senior employees, worn out from the film&#x27;s production, left Studio Ghibli in its aftermath, with Miyazaki himself increasingly withdrawing from public relations. Suzuki recounted that Miyazaki was overtaxed from supervising the storyboards, music, and vocal recordings and had &quot;given his body and soul&quot; to the production. In an interview before the film&#x27;s release, Miyazaki said that, &quot;Physically, I just can&#x27;t go on.&quot; He resigned in 1998 but returned shortly after to direct &quot;Spirited Away&quot;(2001) following the death of Yoshifumi Kondō, who was intended to be Miyazaki&#x27;s successor at Studio Ghibli.

&quot;Princess Mononoke&quot; was the first film in which Miyazaki directly referenced scholarly writing, which strongly contributed to his status in Japanese society as a and marked his works out for further academic inquiry. Alongside &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;(1995–1996), the film laid the foundation for anime to become the subject of study by academics and critics. Yoshioka suggested that Miyazaki&#x27;s growing reputation may have constrained his later creations– as he never wrote a feature film in the style of his earlier action-adventure works after &quot;Princess Mononoke&quot;– and motivated him to retire from the public eye. McCarthy, however, felt that the film provides a novel view of femininity that allows the female characters to express themselves without needing comparison to the men but writes that Miyazaki &quot;opened the gates of this marvelous possibility&quot; only to revert to traditional storytelling and character archetypes in later films.

Yoshioka felt the film&#x27;s widespread success turned Miyazaki into an &quot;icon of contemporary Japanese cinema&quot; on the international stage and primed many of his subsequent works to become commercial successes in turn. It has since become a cult film due to its sustained popularity among fans, and Pett wrote that the film is now an &quot;established cultural touchstone&quot;, identifying multiple other works that it had influenced. James Cameron, for example, cited the film as an influence on his science fiction film &quot;Avatar&quot;(2009). Critics have also named a number of video games that take influence from the film, including &quot;Ori and the Blind Forest&quot;(2015) and &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&quot;(2017). Pett identified a shift in critical writings that reinterpreted San as a feminist figure. In April 2013, Studio Ghibli partnered with the English production company Whole Hog Theatre to create a stage adaptation of the film. It premiered at the New Diorama Theatre in London after selling out a year ahead of time and moved to Tokyo later that year. In 2025, a newly discovered species of deepwater tilefish was named &quot;Branchiostegus sanae&quot; after the character San.

<text>The premier of New South Wales is the head of government in the state of New South Wales, Australia. The Government of New South Wales follows the Westminster Parliamentary System, with a Parliament of New South Wales acting as the legislature. The premier is appointed by the Governor of New South Wales, and by modern convention holds office by their ability to command the support of a majority of members of the lower house of Parliament, the Legislative Assembly.

Before Federation in 1901, the term &quot;prime minister of New South Wales&quot; was also used. &quot;Premier&quot; has been used more or less exclusively from 1901, to avoid confusion with the federal prime minister of Australia.

The current premier is Chris Minns, the leader of the New South Wales Labor Party, who assumed office on 28 March 2023. Minns defeated Dominic Perrottet at the election held on 25 March 2023, after twelve years of Liberal/National Coalition rule.

<doc id="24655" wikidata="Q1550290" url="?curid=24655" title="List of premiers of Victoria">
<text>The premier of Victoria is the head of government of the Australian state of Victoria. The premier leads the Cabinet of Victoria and selects its ministers. The premier is appointed by the governor of Victoria and must be a member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly. To be appointed, the premier must command confidence in the Legislative Assembly, meaning that they must have the support of a majority of Legislative Assembly members. In practice, this is typically the leader of the political party who holds the support of a majority of lower house members.

Each premier since 1933, apart from Ian Macfarlan, who only served for 51 days, has had a portrait commissioned for the Victorian Parliament&#x27;s portrait collection. The tradition was initiated by Legislative Council President Fred Grimwade. Premiers who hold the office for 3,000 days are granted a statue as a commemoration of their legacy. Five premiers, Daniel Andrews, Henry Bolte, John Cain Jr, Albert Dunstan, and Rupert Hamer, have achieved this milestone and four have their statues near the premier&#x27;s office at 1 Treasury Place.

The longest-serving premier was Henry Bolte, who served from 7 June 1955 to 23 August 1972 for a total of 17 years, and 77 days in office. He was a member of the Liberal Party. By contrast, the shortest-serving premier was George Elmslie, who served from 9 December 1913 to 22 December 1913 for a total of 13 days in office. He was also the first premier from the Labor Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;HUN 21/4/22&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The current premier is Jacinta Allan of the Labor Party, who assumed the office on 27 September 2023 following the resignation of Daniel Andrews. Allan is the second female to have held the office.

<doc id="24657" wikidata="Q727694" url="?curid=24657" title="Standard Chinese">
<text>Standard Chinese () is a modern standard form of Mandarin Chinese that was first codified during the republican era (1912–1949). It is designated as the official language of mainland China and a major language in the United Nations, Singapore, and Taiwan. It is largely based on the Beijing dialect. Standard Chinese is a pluricentric language with local standards in mainland China, Taiwan and Singapore that mainly differ in their lexicon. Hong Kong written Chinese, used for formal written communication in Hong Kong and Macau, is a form of Standard Chinese that is read aloud with the Cantonese reading of characters.

Like other Sinitic languages, Standard Chinese is a tonal language with topic-prominent organization and subject–verb–object (SVO) word order. Compared with southern varieties, the language has fewer vowels, final consonants and tones, but more initial consonants. It is an analytic language, albeit with many compound words.

In the context of linguistics, the dialect has been labeled Standard Northern Mandarin or Standard Beijing Mandarin, and in common speech simply Mandarin, more specifically qualified as Standard Mandarin, Modern Standard Mandarin, or Standard Mandarin Chinese.

== Naming ==
===In English===
Among linguists, Standard Chinese has been referred to as &quot;Standard Northern Mandarin&quot; or &quot;Standard Beijing Mandarin&quot;. It is colloquially referred to as simply &quot;Mandarin&quot;, though this term may also refer to the Mandarin dialect group as a whole, or the late imperial form used as a lingua franca. &quot;Mandarin&quot; is a translation of &quot;Guanhua&quot; (), which referred to the late imperial lingua franca. The term &quot;Modern Standard Mandarin&quot; is used to distinguish it from older forms.

===In Chinese===
====&quot;Guoyu&quot; and &quot;Putonghua&quot;====
The word &quot;Guoyu&quot; () was initially used during the late Qing dynasty to refer to the Manchu language. The 1655 &quot;Memoir of Qing Dynasty, Volume: Emperor Nurhaci&quot; () says: &quot;(In 1631) as Manchu ministers do not comprehend the Han language, each ministry shall create a new position to be filled up by Han official who can comprehend the national language.&quot; However, the sense of &quot;Guoyu&quot; as a specific language variety promoted for general use by the citizenry was originally borrowed from Japan in the early 20th century. In 1902, the Japanese Diet had formed the National Language Research Council to standardize a form of the Japanese language dubbed (). Reformers in the Qing bureaucracy took inspiration and borrowed the term into Chinese, and in 1909 the Qing education ministry officially proclaimed imperial Mandarin to be the new national language.

The term &quot;Putonghua&quot; () dates back to 1906 in writings by Zhu Wenxiong to differentiate the standard vernacular Mandarin from Literary Chinese and other varieties of Chinese.

====Usage concerns====
Since 2000, the Chinese government has used the term &quot;Countrywide common spoken and written language&quot; (), while also making provisions for the use and protection of ethnic minority languages. The term is derived from the title of a 2000 law which defines &quot;Putonghua&quot; as the &quot;Countrywide Common Spoken and Written Language&quot;.

Use of the term &quot;Putonghua&quot; (&#x27;common tongue&#x27;) deliberately avoids calling the dialect a &#x27;national language&#x27;, in order to mitigate the impression of coercing minority groups to adopt the language of the majority. Such concerns were first raised by the early Communist leader Qu Qiubai in 1931. His concern echoed within the Communist Party, which adopted the term &quot;Putonghua&quot; in 1955. Since 1949, usage of the word &quot;Guoyu&quot; was phased out in the PRC, only surviving in established compound nouns, e.g. &#x27;Mandopop&#x27; (), or &#x27;Chinese cinema&#x27; ().

In Taiwan, &quot;Guoyu&quot; is the colloquial term for Standard Chinese. In 2017 and 2018, the Taiwanese government introduced two laws explicitly recognizing the indigenous Formosan languages and Hakka as &quot;Languages of the nation&quot; () alongside Standard Chinese. Since then, there have been efforts to redefine &quot;Guoyu&quot; as encompassing all &quot;languages of the nation&quot;, rather than exclusively referring to Standard Chinese.

====&quot;Hanyu&quot; and &quot;Zhongwen&quot;====
Among Chinese people, &quot;Hanyu&quot; () refers to spoken varieties of Chinese. &quot;Zhongwen&quot; () refers to written Chinese. Among foreigners, the term &quot;Hanyu&quot; is most commonly used in textbooks and Standard Chinese education, such as in the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi (HSK) test.

====&quot;Huayu&quot;====
Until the mid-1960s, &quot;Huayu&quot; () referred to all the language varieties used among the Chinese nation. For example, Cantonese, Mandarin, and Hokkien films produced in Hong Kong were imported into Malaysia and collectively known as &quot;&quot;Huayu&quot; cinema&quot; until the mid-1960s. Gradually, the term has been re-appropriated to refer specifically to Standard Chinese. The term is mostly used in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.

== History ==
The Chinese language has had considerable dialectal variation throughout its history, including prestige dialects and linguae francae used throughout the territory controlled by the dynastic states of China. For example, Confucius is thought to have used a dialect known as &quot;yayan&quot; rather than regional dialects; during the Han dynasty, texts also referred to (). The rime books that were written starting in the Northern and Southern period may have reflected standard systems of pronunciation. However, these standard dialects were mostly used by the educated elite, whose pronunciation may still have possessed great variation. For these elites, the Chinese language was unified in Literary Chinese, a form that was primarily written, as opposed to spoken.

=== Late empire ===

The term &quot;Guanhua&quot; () was used during the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing (1644–1912) dynasties to refer to the lingua franca spoken within the imperial courts. The term &quot;Mandarin&quot; is borrowed directly from the Portuguese word , in turn derived from the Sanskrit word (&#x27;minister&#x27;)—and was initially used to refer to Chinese scholar-officials. The Portuguese then began referring to &quot;Guanhua&quot; as &quot;the language of the mandarins&quot;.

During the 17th century, the state had set up orthoepy academies () in an attempt to conform the speech of bureaucrats to the standard. These attempts had little success: as late as the 19th century, the emperor had difficulty understanding some of his ministers in court, who did not always follow a standard pronunciation.

Before the 19th century, the lingua franca was based on the Nanjing dialect, but later the Beijing dialect became increasingly influential, despite the mix of officials and commoners speaking various dialects in the capital, Beijing. By some accounts, as late as 1900 the position of the Nanjing dialect was considered by some to be above that of Beijing; the postal romanization standards established in 1906 included spellings that reflected elements of Nanjing pronunciation. The sense of &quot;Guoyu&quot; as a specific language variety promoted for general use by the citizenry was originally borrowed from Japan; in 1902 the Japanese Diet had formed the National Language Research Council to standardize a form of the Japanese language dubbed (). Reformers in the Qing bureaucracy took inspiration and borrowed the term into Chinese, and in 1909 the Qing education ministry officially proclaimed imperial Mandarin as &quot;Guoyu&quot; (), the &#x27;national language&#x27;.

=== Republican era ===
After the Republic of China was established in 1912, there was more success in promoting a common national language. A Commission on the Unification of Pronunciation was convened with delegates from the entire country. A &quot;Dictionary of National Pronunciation&quot; () was published in 1919, defining a hybrid pronunciation that did not match any existing speech. Meanwhile, despite the lack of a workable standardized pronunciation, colloquial literature in written vernacular Chinese continued to develop.

Gradually, the members of the National Language Commission came to settle upon the Beijing dialect, which became the major source of standard national pronunciation due to its prestigious status. In 1932, the commission published the &quot;Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use&quot; (), with little fanfare or official announcement. This dictionary was similar to the previous published one except that it normalized the pronunciations for all characters into the pronunciation of the Beijing dialect. Elements from other dialects continue to exist in the standard language, but as exceptions rather than the rule.

Following the end of the Chinese Civil War, the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) continued standardisation efforts on the mainland, and in 1955 officially began using &quot;Putonghua&quot; () instead of &quot;Guoyu&quot;, which remains the name used in Taiwan. The forms of Standard Chinese used in China and Taiwan have diverged somewhat since the end of the Civil War, especially in newer vocabulary, and a little in pronunciation.

In 1956, the PRC officially defined Standard Chinese as &quot;the standard form of Modern Chinese with the Beijing phonological system as its norm of pronunciation, and Northern dialects as its base dialect, and looking to exemplary modern works in written vernacular Chinese for its grammatical norms.&quot; According to the official definition, Standard Chinese uses:
* The phonology of the Beijing dialect, if not always with each phoneme having the precise phonetic values as those heard in Beijing.
* The vocabulary of Mandarin dialects in general, excepting what are deemed to be slang and regionalisms. The vocabulary of all Chinese varieties, especially in more technical fields like science, law, and government, is very similar—akin to the profusion of Latin and Greek vocabulary in European languages. This means that much of the vocabulary of Standard Chinese is shared with all varieties of Chinese. Much of the colloquial vocabulary of the Beijing dialect is not considered part of Standard Chinese, and may not be understood by people outside Beijing.
* The grammar and idioms of exemplary modern Chinese literature, a form known as written vernacular Chinese. Written vernacular Chinese is loosely based upon a synthesis of predominantly northern grammar and vocabulary, with southern and Literary elements. This distinguishes Standard Chinese from the dialect heard on the streets of Beijing.

Proficiency in the new standard was initially limited, even among Mandarin speakers, but increased over the following decades.
A 2007 survey conducted by the Chinese Ministry of Education indicated that 53.06% of the population were able to effectively communicate using Standard Chinese. By 2020, this figure had risen to over 80%.

== Status ==
In both mainland China and Taiwan, Standard Chinese is used in most official contexts, as well as the media and educational system, contributing to its proliferation. As a result, it is now spoken by most people in both countries, though often with some regional or personal variation in vocabulary and pronunciation.

In overseas Chinese communities outside Asia where Cantonese once dominated, such as the Chinatown in Manhattan, the use of Standard Chinese, which is the primary lingua franca of more recent Chinese immigrants, is rapidly increasing.

=== Mainland China ===

While Standard Chinese was made China&#x27;s official language in the early 20th century, local languages continue to be the main form of everyday communication in much of the country. The language policy adopted by the Chinese government promotes the use of Standard Chinese while also making allowances for the use and preservation of local varieties. From an official point of view, Standard Chinese serves as a lingua franca to facilitate communication between speakers of mutually unintelligible varieties of Chinese and non-Sinitic languages. The name &quot;Putonghua&quot;, or &#x27;common speech&#x27;, reinforces this idea. However, due to Standard Chinese being a &quot;public&quot; lingua franca, other Chinese varieties and even non-Sinitic languages have shown signs of losing ground to the standard dialect. In many areas, especially in southern China, it is commonly used for practical reasons, as linguistic diversity is so great that residents of neighboring cities may have difficulties communicating with each other without a lingua franca.

The Chinese government&#x27;s language policy been largely successful, with over 80% of the Chinese population able to speak Standard Chinese as of 2020. The Chinese government&#x27;s current goal is to have 85% of the country&#x27;s population speak Standard Chinese by 2025, and virtually the entire country by 2035. Throughout the country, Standard Chinese has heavily influenced local languages through diglossia, replacing them entirely in some cases, especially among younger people in urban areas.

The Chinese government is keen to promote &quot;Putonghua&quot; as the national lingua franca: under the &quot;National Common Language and Writing Law&quot;, the government is required to promote its use. Officially, the Chinese government has not stated its intent to replace regional varieties with Standard Chinese. However, regulations enacted by local governments to implement the national law have included measures to control the use of spoken dialects and traditional characters in writing. For example, the &quot;Guangdong National Language Regulations&quot; enacted in 2012 generally require broadcasts in the province to be in Standard Chinese, with programs and channels able to broadcast in other varieties if approved by the national or provincial government. Government employees, including teachers, conference holders, broadcasters, and TV staff are required to use Standard Chinese. In addition, public signage is to be written using simplified characters, with exceptions for historical sites, pre-registered logos, or when approved by the state. Public brands, seals, documents, websites, signs, and trade names are not to use traditional characters or character variants.

Some Chinese speakers who are older or from rural areas cannot speak Standard Chinese fluently or at all, though most are able to understand it. Meanwhile, those from urban areas—as well as younger speakers, who have received their education primarily in Standard Chinese—are almost all fluent in it, with some being unable to speak their local dialect.

The Chinese government has disseminated public service announcements promoting the use of &quot;Putonghua&quot; on television and the radio, as well as on public buses. The standardization campaign has been challenged by local dialectical and ethnic populations, who fear the loss of their cultural identity and native dialect. In the summer of 2010, reports of a planned increase in the use of the &quot;Putonghua&quot; on local television in Guangdong led to demonstrations on the streets by thousands of Cantonese-speaking citizens. While the use of Standard Chinese is encouraged as the common working language in predominantly Han areas on the mainland, the PRC has been more sensitive to the status of non-Sinitic minority languages, and has generally not discouraged their social use outside of education.

=== Hong Kong and Macau ===
In Hong Kong and Macau, which are special administrative regions of the PRC, there is diglossia between Cantonese () as the primary spoken language, alongside a local form of Standard Chinese () used in schools, local government, and formal writing. Written Cantonese may also be used in informal settings such as advertisements, magazines, popular literature, and comics. Mixture of formal and informal written Chinese occurs to various degrees. After the Hong Kong&#x27;s handover from the United Kingdom and Macau&#x27;s handover from Portugal, their governments use &quot;Putonghua&quot; to communicate with the PRC&#x27;s Central People&#x27;s Government. There has been significant effort to promote use of &quot;Putonghua&quot; in Hong Kong since the handover, including the training of police and teachers.

=== Taiwan ===

Standard Chinese is the official language of Taiwan. Standard Chinese started being widely spoken in Taiwan following the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, with the relocation of the Kuomintang (KMT) to the island along with an influx of refugees from the mainland. The Standard Chinese used in Taiwan differs very little from that of mainland China, with differences largely being in technical vocabulary introduced after 1949.

Prior to 1949, the varieties most commonly spoken by Taiwan&#x27;s Han population were Taiwanese Hokkien, as well as Hakka to a lesser extent. Much of the Taiwanese Aboriginal population spoke their native Formosan languages. During the period of martial law between 1949 and 1987, the Taiwanese government revived the Mandarin Promotion Council, discouraging or in some cases forbidding the use of Hokkien and other non-standard varieties. This resulted in Standard Chinese replacing Hokkien as the country&#x27;s lingua franca, and ultimately, a political backlash in the 1990s. Starting in the 2000s during the administration of President Chen Shui-Bian, the Taiwanese government began making efforts to recognize the country&#x27;s other languages. They began being taught in schools, and their use increased in media, though Standard Chinese remains the country&#x27;s lingua franca. Chen often used Hokkien in his speeches; later Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui also openly spoke Hokkien. In an amendment to the Enforcement Rules of the Passport Act () passed on 9 August 2019, Taiwan&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that romanized spellings of names in Hoklo, Hakka and Aboriginal languages may be used in Taiwanese passports. Previously, only Mandarin names could be romanized.

=== Singapore ===

Mandarin is one of the four official languages of Singapore, along with English, Malay, and Tamil. Historically, it was seldom used by the Chinese Singaporean community, which primarily spoke the Southern Chinese languages of Hokkien, Teochew, Cantonese, or Hakka. Standard Singaporean Mandarin is nearly identical to the standards of China and Taiwan, with minor vocabulary differences. It is the Mandarin variant used in education, media, and official settings. Meanwhile, a colloquial form called Singdarin is used in informal daily life and is heavily influenced in terms of both grammar and vocabulary by local languages such as Cantonese, Hokkien, and Malay. Instances of code-switching with English, Hokkien, Cantonese, Malay, or a combination thereof are also common.

In Singapore, the government has heavily promoted a &quot;Speak Mandarin Campaign&quot; since the late 1970s, with the use of other Chinese varieties in broadcast media being prohibited and their use in any context officially discouraged until recently. This has led to some resentment amongst the older generations, as Singapore&#x27;s migrant Chinese community is made up almost entirely of people of south Chinese descent. Lee Kuan Yew, the initiator of the campaign, admitted that to most Chinese Singaporeans, Mandarin was a &quot;stepmother tongue&quot; rather than a true mother language. Nevertheless, he saw the need for a unified language among the Chinese community not biased in favor of any existing group.

===Malaysia===

In Malaysia, Mandarin has been adopted by local Chinese-language schools as the medium of instruction with the standard shared with Singaporean Chinese. Together influenced by the Singaporean Speak Mandarin Campaign and Chinese culture revival movement in the 1980s, Malaysian Chinese started their own promotion of Mandarin too, and similar to Singapore, but to a lesser extent, experienced language shift from other Chinese variants to Mandarin. Today, Mandarin functions as lingua franca among Malaysian Chinese, while Hokkien and Cantonese are still retained in the northern part and central part of Peninsular Malaysia respectively.

===Myanmar===

In some regions controlled by insurgent groups in northern Myanmar, Mandarin serves as the lingua franca.

== Education ==
In both mainland China and Taiwan, Standard Chinese is taught by immersion starting in elementary school. After the second grade, the entire educational system is in Standard Chinese, except for local language classes that have been taught for a few hours each week in Taiwan starting in the mid-1990s.

With an increase in internal migration in China, the official Putonghua Proficiency Test (PSC) has become popular. Employers often require a level of Standard Chinese proficiency from applicants depending on the position, and many university graduates on the mainland take the PSC before looking for a job.

== Phonology ==
The pronunciation of Standard Chinese is defined as that of the Beijing dialect.
The usual unit of analysis is the syllable, consisting of an optional initial consonant, an optional medial glide, a main vowel and an optional coda, and further distinguished by a tone.
The palatal initials , and pose a classic problem of phonemic analysis. Since they occur only before high front vowels, they are in complementary distribution with three other series, the dental sibilants, retroflexes and velars, which never occur in this position.

The final, which occurs only after dental sibilant and retroflex initials, is a syllabic approximant, prolonging the initial.
The rhotacized vowel forms a complete syllable.
A reduced form of this syllable occurs as a sub-syllabic suffix, spelled &quot;-r&quot; in pinyin and often with a diminutive connotation. The suffix modifies the coda of the base syllable in a rhotacizing process called &quot;erhua&quot;.

Each full syllable is pronounced with a phonemically distinctive pitch contour. There are four tonal categories, marked in pinyin with diacritics, as in the words (; &#x27;mother&#x27;), (; &#x27;hemp&#x27;), (; &#x27;horse&#x27;) and (; &#x27;curse&#x27;). The tonal categories also have secondary characteristics. For example, the third tone is long and murmured, whereas the fourth tone is relatively short. Statistically, vowels and tones are of similar importance in the language.

There are also weak syllables, including grammatical particles such as the interrogative &quot;ma&quot; () and certain syllables in polysyllabic words. These syllables are short, with their pitch determined by the preceding syllable. Such syllables are commonly described as being in the neutral tone.

=== Regional accents ===
It is common for Standard Chinese to be spoken with the speaker&#x27;s regional accent, depending on factors such as age, level of education, and the need and frequency to speak in official or formal situations.

Due to evolution and standardization, Mandarin, although based on the Beijing dialect, is no longer synonymous with it. Part of this was due to the standardization to reflect a greater vocabulary scheme and a more archaic and &quot;proper-sounding&quot; pronunciation and vocabulary.

Distinctive features of the Beijing dialect are more extensive use of &quot;erhua&quot; in vocabulary items that are left unadorned in descriptions of the standard such as the &quot;Xiandai Hanyu Cidian&quot;, as well as more neutral tones. An example of standard versus Beijing dialect would be the standard (door) and Beijing .

While the Standard Chinese spoken in Taiwan is nearly identical to that of mainland China, the colloquial form has been heavily influenced by other local languages, especially Taiwanese Hokkien. Notable differences include: the merger of retroflex sounds (zh, ch, sh, r) with the alveolar series (z, c, s), frequent mergers of the &quot;neutral tone&quot; with a word&#x27;s original tone, and absence of &quot;erhua&quot;. Code-switching between Mandarin and Taiwanese Hokkien is common, as the majority of the population continues to also speak the latter as a native language.

The stereotypical &quot;southern Chinese&quot; accent does not distinguish between retroflex and alveolar consonants, pronouncing pinyin &quot;zh&quot; [tʂ], &quot;ch&quot; [tʂʰ], and &quot;sh&quot; [ʂ] in the same way as &quot;z&quot; [ts], &quot;c&quot; [tsʰ], and &quot;s&quot; [s] respectively. Southern-accented Standard Chinese may also interchange &quot;l&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, final &quot;n&quot; and &quot;ng&quot;, and vowels &quot;i&quot; and &quot;ü&quot; [y]. Attitudes towards southern accents, particularly the Cantonese accent, range from disdain to admiration.

== Grammar ==
Chinese is a strongly analytic language, having almost no inflectional morphemes, and relying on word order and particles to express relationships between the parts of a sentence.
Nouns are not marked for case and rarely marked for number.
Verbs are not marked for agreement or grammatical tense, but aspect is marked using post-verbal particles.

The basic word order is subject–verb–object (SVO), as in English.
Nouns are generally preceded by any modifiers (adjectives, possessives and relative clauses), and verbs also generally follow any modifiers (adverbs, auxiliary verbs and prepositional phrases).

The predicate can be an intransitive verb, a transitive verb followed by a direct object, a copula (linking verb) () followed by a noun phrase, etc.

In predicative use, Chinese adjectives function as stative verbs, forming complete predicates in their own right without a copula. For example,
Chinese additionally differs from English in that it forms another kind of sentence by stating a topic and following it by a comment. To do this in English, speakers generally flag the topic of a sentence by prefacing it with &quot;as for&quot;. For example:
The time when something happens can be given by an explicit term such as &quot;yesterday&quot;, by relative terms such as &quot;formerly&quot;, etc.

As in many east Asian languages, classifiers or measure words are required when using numerals, demonstratives and similar quantifiers.
There are many different classifiers in the language, and each noun generally has a particular classifier associated with it.
The general classifier &quot;ge&quot; (/) is gradually replacing specific classifiers.

In word formation, the language allows for compounds and for reduplication.

== Vocabulary ==
Many honorifics used in imperial China are also used in daily conversation in modern Mandarin, such as (; ; &#x27;[my] humble&#x27;) and (; ; &#x27;[your] honorable&#x27;).

Although Chinese speakers make a clear distinction between Standard Chinese and the Beijing dialect, there are aspects of Beijing dialect that have made it into the official standard. Standard Chinese has a T–V distinction between the polite and informal &quot;you&quot; that comes from the Beijing dialect, although its use is quite diminished in daily speech. It also distinguishes between &quot; (&#x27;we&#x27;, including the listener) and &quot; (&#x27;we&#x27;, not including the listener). In practice, neither distinction is commonly used by most Chinese, at least outside the Beijing area.

The following samples are some phrases from the Beijing dialect which are not yet accepted into Standard Chinese:
* means &#x27;very much&#x27;; means &#x27;stagger&#x27;; means &#x27;do not worry about&#x27;; means &#x27;eat&#x27;; means &#x27;slip&#x27;; means &#x27;man, male&#x27;.

The following samples are some phrases from Beijing dialect which have become accepted as Standard Chinese:
* means &#x27;not very skillful&#x27;; means &#x27;good male friend&#x27;, &#x27;buddy&#x27;; means &#x27;frugal&#x27; or &#x27;stingy&#x27;.

== Writing system ==

Standard Chinese is written with characters corresponding to syllables of the language, most of which represent a morpheme.
In most cases, these characters come from those used in Classical Chinese to write cognate morphemes of late Old Chinese, though their pronunciation, and often meaning, has shifted dramatically over two millennia.
However, there are several words, many of them heavily used, which have no classical counterpart or whose etymology is obscure.
Two strategies have been used to write such words:
* An unrelated character with the same or similar pronunciation might be used, especially if its original sense was no longer common. For example, the demonstrative pronouns &#x27;this&#x27; and &#x27;that&#x27; have no counterparts in Classical Chinese, which used and respectively. Hence the character (later simplified as ) for &#x27;to meet&#x27; was borrowed to write &#x27;this&#x27;, and the character for , the name of a country and later a rare surname, was borrowed to write &#x27;that&#x27;.
* A new character, usually a phono-semantic or semantic compound, might be created. For example, &#x27;pursue&#x27;, &#x27;overtake&#x27;, is written with a new character , composed of the signific &#x27;run&#x27; and the phonetic &#x27;drought&#x27;. This method was used to represent many elements in the periodic table.

The PRC, as well as several other governments and institutions, has promulgated a set of simplified character forms. Under this system, the forms of the words (&#x27;here&#x27;) and (&#x27;there&#x27;) changed from and to and , among many other changes.

Chinese characters were traditionally read from top to bottom, right to left, but in modern usage it is more common to read from left to right.

<text>The premier of Tasmania is the head of the executive government in the Australian state of Tasmania. By convention, the leader of the party or political grouping which has majority support in the House of Assembly is invited by the governor of Tasmania to be premier and principal adviser.

Since 8 April 2022, the premier of Tasmania has been Jeremy Rockliff, leader of the Liberal Party, which holds 14 of the 35 seats in the House of Assembly.

==List of premiers of Tasmania==
Before the 1890s, there was no formal party system in Tasmania. Party labels before that time indicate a general tendency only. The current convention of appointing the premier from the House of Assembly did not develop until the late 19th century, with eight premiers appointed from the Legislative Council (the last being Philip Fysh from 1887 to 1892).

<doc id="24661" wikidata="Q161500" url="?curid=24661" title="Privatization">
<text>Privatization (rendered privatisation in British English) can mean several different things, most commonly referring to moving something from the public sector into the private sector. It is also sometimes used as a synonym for deregulation when a heavily regulated private company or industry becomes less regulated. Government functions and services may also be privatised (which may also be known as &quot;franchising&quot; or &quot;out-sourcing&quot;); in this case, private entities are tasked with the implementation of government programs or performance of government services that had previously been the purview of state-run agencies. Some examples include revenue collection, law enforcement, water supply, and prison management.

Another definition is that privatization is the sale of a state-owned enterprise or municipally owned corporation to private investors; in this case shares may be traded in the public market for the first time, or for the first time since an enterprise&#x27;s previous nationalization. This type of privatization can include the demutualization of a mutual organization, cooperative, or public-private partnership in order to form a joint-stock company.

Separately, privatization can refer to the purchase of all outstanding shares of a publicly traded company by private equity investors, which is more often called &quot;going private&quot;. Before and after this process the company is privately owned, but after the buyout its shares are withdrawn from being traded at a public stock exchange.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;privatizing&quot; first appeared in English, with quotation marks, in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, in April 1923, in a translation of a German speech referring to the potential for German state railroads to be bought by American companies. In German, the word &quot;Privatisierung&quot; has been used since at least the 19th century. Ultimately, the word came to German through French from the Latin .

The term &quot;reprivatization&quot;, again translated directly from German (), was used frequently in the mid-1930s as &quot;The Economist&quot; reported on Nazi Germany&#x27;s sale of nationalized banks back to public shareholders following the 1931 economic crisis.

The word became common in the late 1970s and early 1980s as part of UK prime minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s economic policies. She was drawing on the work of the pro-privatization Member of Parliament David Howell, who was himself drawing on the Austrian-American management expert Peter Drucker&#x27;s 1969 book, &quot;The Age of Discontinuity&quot;.

== Definition ==
The word &quot;privatization&quot; may mean different things depending on the context in which it is used. It can mean moving something from the public sphere into the private sphere, but it may also be used to describe something that was always private, but heavily regulated, which becomes less regulated through a process of deregulation. The term may also be used descriptively for something that has always been private, but could be public in other jurisdictions.

There are also private entities that may perform public functions. These entities could also be described as privatized. Privatization may mean the government sells state-owned businesses to private interests, but it may also be discussed in the context of the privatization of services or government functions, where private entities are tasked with the implementation of government programs or the performance of government services. Gillian E. Metzger has written that: &quot;Private entities [in the US] provide a vast array of social services for the government; administer core aspects of government programs; and perform tasks that appear quintessentially governmental, such as promulgating standards or regulating third-party activities.&quot; Metzger mentions an expansion of privatization that includes health and welfare programs, public education, and prisons.

== History ==
=== Pre-20th century ===
The history of privatization dates from Ancient Greece, when governments contracted out almost everything to the private sector. In the Roman Republic private individuals and companies performed the majority of services including tax collection (tax farming), army supplies (military contractors), religious sacrifices and construction. However, the Roman Empire also created state-owned enterprises—for example, much of the grain was eventually produced on estates owned by the Emperor. David Parker and David S. Saal suggest that the cost of bureaucracy was one of the reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire.

Perhaps one of the first ideological movements towards privatization came during China&#x27;s golden age of the Han dynasty. Taoism came into prominence for the first time at a state level, and it advocated the laissez-faire principle of Wu wei (無為), literally meaning &quot;do nothing&quot;. The rulers were counseled by the Taoist clergy that a strong ruler was virtually invisible.

During the Renaissance, most of Europe was still by and large following the feudal economic model. By contrast, the Ming dynasty in China began once more to practice privatization, especially with regards to their manufacturing industries. This was a reversal of the earlier Song dynasty policies, which had themselves overturned earlier policies in favor of more rigorous state control.

In Britain, the privatization of common lands is referred to as enclosure (in Scotland as the Lowland Clearances and the Highland Clearances). Significant privatizations of this nature occurred from 1760 to 1820, preceding the Industrial Revolution in that country.

=== 20th century onwards ===
The first mass privatization of state property occurred in Nazi Germany between 1933 and 1937: &quot;It is a fact that the government of the National Socialist Party sold off public ownership in several state-owned firms in the middle of the 1930s. The firms belonged to a wide range of sectors: steel, mining, banking, local public utilities, shipyard, ship-lines, railways, etc. In addition to this, delivery of some public services produced by public administrations prior to the 1930s, especially social services and services related to work, was transferred to the private sector, mainly to several organizations within the Nazi Party.&quot;

Great Britain privatized its steel industry in the 1950s, and the West German government embarked on large-scale privatization, including sale of the majority stake in Volkswagen to small investors in public share offerings in 1961. However, it was in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher in the United Kingdom and Ronald Reagan in the United States that privatization gained worldwide momentum. Notable privatizations in the UK included Britoil (1982), the radioactive-chemicals company Amersham International (1982), British Telecom (1984), Sealink ferries (1984), British Petroleum (gradually privatized between 1979 and 1987), British Aerospace (1985 to 1987), British Gas (1986), Rolls-Royce (1987), Rover Group (formerly British Leyland, 1988), British Steel Corporation (1988), Girobank (1989), and the regional water authorities of England and Wales (mostly in 1989). After 1979, council house tenants in the UK were given the right to buy their homes at a heavily discounted price; one million had purchased their residences by 1986.

Such efforts culminated in 1993 when British Rail was privatized under Thatcher&#x27;s successor, John Major. British Rail had been formed by prior nationalization of private rail companies. The privatization was controversial, and its impact is still debated today, as doubling of passenger numbers and investment was balanced by an increase in rail subsidy.

These privatizations received mixed views from the public and the parliament. Even former Conservative prime minister Harold Macmillan was critical of the policy, likening it to &quot;selling the family silver&quot;. There were around 3 million shareholders in Britain when Thatcher took office in 1979, but the subsequent sale of state-run firms saw the number of shareholders double by 1985. By the time of her resignation in 1990, there were more than 10 million shareholders in Britain.

Privatization in Latin America was extensive in the 1980s and 1990s, as a result of a Western liberal economic policy. Companies providing public services such as water management, transportation, and telecommunications were rapidly sold off to the private sector. In the 1990s, privatization revenue from 18 Latin American countries totaled 6% of gross domestic product. Private investment in infrastructure from 1990 and 2001 reached $360.5 billion, $150 billion more than in the next emerging economy.

While economists generally give favorable evaluations of the impact of privatization in Latin America, opinion polls and public protests across the countries suggest that a large segment of the public is dissatisfied with or have negative views of privatization in the region.

In the 1990s, the governments in Eastern and Central Europe engaged in extensive privatization of state-owned enterprises in Eastern and Central Europe and Russia, with assistance from the World Bank, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the German Treuhand, and other governmental and non-governmental organization.

Nippon Telegraph and Telephone&#x27;s privatization in 1987 involved the largest share offering in financial history at the time. 15 of the world&#x27;s 20 largest public share offerings have been privatizations of telecoms.

In 1988, the perestroika policy of Mikhail Gorbachev started allowing privatization of the centrally planned economy. Large privatization of the Soviet economy occurred over the next few years as the country dissolved. Other Eastern Bloc countries followed suit after the Revolutions of 1989 introduced non-communist governments.

Freedom House&#x27;s privatization index, 1998 and 2002&lt;br&gt;
Freedom House&#x27;s privatization index rated transition countries from 1 (maximum progress) to 7 (no progress). The table below shows the privatization index for various Eastern European countries in 1998 and 2002:

The largest public shares offering in France involved France Télécom.

Egypt undertook widespread privatization under Hosni Mubarak. Following his overthrow in the 2011 revolution, most of the public began to call for re-nationalization, citing allegations of the privatized firms practicing crony capitalism under the old regime.

==Reasons for privatization==

There are various reasons why a government may decide to privatize; commonly due to economic reasons. The economic factors that influence a government&#x27;s decision to privatize assume this will lower government debt. Studies have shown that governments are more likely to privatise with higher public debt, typically because governments do not have the needed time to wait for a return. Another economic factor that influences this area is the resulting efficiency of SOEs once privatised. Commonly, governments aren’t able to provide the required investments required to ensure profitability for various reasons. These factors may lead to a government deciding to privatize.

== Forms of privatization ==

There are several main methods of privatization:
# Share issue privatization: shares sale on the stock market.
# Asset sale privatization: asset divestiture to a strategic investor, usually by auction or through the Treuhand model.
# Voucher privatization: distribution of vouchers, which represent part ownership of a corporation, to all citizens, usually for free or at a very low price.
# Privatization from below: start of new private businesses in formerly socialist countries.
# Management buyout: purchase of public shares by management of the company, sometimes by borrowing from external lenders
# Employee buyout: distribution of shares for free or at a very low price to workers or management of the organization.

The choice of sale method is influenced by the capital market and the political and firm-specific factors. Privatization through the stock market is more likely to be the method used when there is an established capital market capable of absorbing the shares. A market with high liquidity can facilitate the privatization. If the capital markets are insufficiently developed, however, it would be difficult to find enough buyers. The shares may have to be underpriced, and the sales may not raise as much capital as would be justified by the fair value of the company being privatized. Many governments, therefore, elect for listings in more sophisticated markets, for example, Euronext, and the London, New York and Hong Kong stock exchanges.

Governments in developing countries and transition countries more often resort to direct asset sales to a few investors, partly because those countries do not yet have a stock market with high capital.

Voucher privatization occurred mainly in the transition economies in Central and Eastern Europe, such as Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Additionally, privatization from below had made important contribution to economic growth in transition economies.

In one study assimilating some of the literature on &quot;privatization&quot; that occurred in Russian and Czech Republic transition economies, the authors identified three methods of privatization: &quot;privatization by sale&quot;, &quot;mass privatization&quot;, and &quot;mixed privatization&quot;. Their calculations showed that &quot;mass privatization&quot; was the most effective method.

However, in economies &quot;characterized by shortages&quot; and maintained by the state bureaucracy, wealth was accumulated and concentrated by &quot;gray/black market&quot; operators. Privatizing industries by sale to these individuals did not mean a transition to &quot;effective private sector owners [of former] state assets&quot;. Rather than mainly participating in a market economy, these individuals could prefer elevating their personal status or prefer accumulating political power. Instead, outside foreign investment led to the efficient conduct of former state assets in the private sector and market economy.

Through privatization by direct asset sale or the stock market, bidders compete to offer higher prices, generating more revenue for the state. Voucher privatization, on the other hand, could represent a genuine transfer of assets to the general population, creating a sense of participation and inclusion. A market could be created if the government permits transfer of vouchers among voucher holders.

=== Secured borrowing ===
Some privatization transactions can be interpreted as a form of a secured loan and are criticized as a &quot;particularly noxious form of governmental debt&quot;. In this interpretation, the upfront payment from the privatization sale corresponds to the principal amount of the loan, while the proceeds from the underlying asset correspond to secured interest payments—the transaction can be considered substantively the same as a secured loan, though it is structured as a sale. This interpretation is particularly argued to apply to recent municipal transactions in the United States, particularly for fixed term, such as the 2008 sale of the proceeds from Chicago parking meters for 75 years. It is argued that this is motivated by &quot;politicians&#x27; desires to borrow money surreptitiously&quot;, due to legal restrictions on and political resistance to alternative sources of revenue, viz, raising taxes or issuing debt.

== Results of privatization ==
Privatization had different outcomes around the world. Results of privatization may vary depending on the privatization model employed. According to Irwin Stelzer, &quot;it is somewhere between difficult and impossible to separate the effects of privatisation from the effects of such things as trends in the economy&quot;.

According to research performed by the World Bank and William L. Megginson in the early 2000s, privatization in competitive industries with well-informed consumers, consistently improved efficiency. According to APEC, the more competitive the industry, the greater the improvement in output, profitability, and efficiency. Such efficiency gains mean a one-off increase in GDP, but through improved incentives to innovate and reduce costs also tend to raise the rate of economic growth.

More recent research and literature review performed by Professor Saul Estrin and Adeline Pelletier concluded that &quot;the literature now reflects a more cautious and nuanced evaluation of privatization&quot; and that &quot;private ownership alone is no longer argued to automatically generate economic gains in developing economies&quot;. According to a 2008 study published in &quot;Annals of Public and Cooperative Economics&quot;, liberalization and privatization have produced mixed results.

Although typically there are many costs associated with these efficiency gains,
many economists argue that these can be dealt with by appropriate government support through redistribution and perhaps retraining. Yet, some empirical literature suggests that privatization could also have very modest effects on efficiency and quite regressive distributive impact. In the first attempt at a social welfare analysis of the British privatization program under the Conservative governments of Margaret Thatcher and John Major during the 1980s and 1990s, Massimo Florio points to the absence of any productivity shock resulting strictly from ownership change. Instead, the impact on the previously nationalized companies of the UK productivity leap under the Conservatives varied in different industries. In some cases, it occurred prior to privatization, and in other cases, it occurred upon privatization or several years afterward.

A 2012 study published by the European Commission argues that privatisation in Europe had mixed effects on service quality and has achieved only minor productivity gains, driven mainly by lower labour input combined with other cost cutting strategies that led to a deterioration of employment and working conditions. Meanwhile, a different study by the commission found that the UK rail network (which was privatized from 1994 to 1997) was most improved out of all the 27 EU nations from 1997 to 2012. The report examined a range of 14 different factors and the UK came top in four of the factors, second and third in another two and fourth in three, coming top overall. Nonetheless, the impact of the privatisation of British Rail has been the subject of much debate, with the stated benefits including improved customer service, and more investment; and stated drawbacks including higher fares, lower punctuality and increased rail subsidies.

Privatizations in Russia and Latin America were accompanied by large-scale corruption during the sale of the state-owned companies. Those with political connections unfairly gained large wealth, which has discredited privatization in these regions. While media have widely reported the grand corruption that accompanied those sales, according to research released by the World Bank there has been increased operating efficiency, daily petty corruption is, or would be, larger without privatization, and that corruption is more prevalent in non-privatized sectors. Furthermore, according to the World Bank extralegal and unofficial activities are more prevalent in countries that privatized less. Other research suggests that privatization in Russia resulted in a dramatic rise in the level of economic inequality and a collapse in GDP and industrial output.

Russian President Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s IMF-backed rapid privatization schemes saw half the Russian population fall into destitution in just several years as unemployment climbed to double digits by the early to mid 1990s. A 2009 study published in &quot;The Lancet&quot; medical journal has found that as many as a million working men died as a result of economic shocks associated with mass privatization in the former Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe during the 1990s, although a further study suggested that there were errors in their method and &quot;correlations reported in the original article are simply not robust.&quot; A subsequent body of scholarship, while still controversial, demonstrates that rapid privatization schemes associated with neoliberal economic reforms did result in poorer health outcomes in former Eastern Bloc countries during the transition to markets economies, with the World Health Organization contributing to the debate by stating &quot;IMF economic reform programs are associated with significantly worsened tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates in post-communist Eastern European and former Soviet countries.&quot; Historian Walter Scheidel, a specialist in ancient history, posits that economic inequality and wealth concentration in the top percentile &quot;had been made possible by the transfer of state assets to private owners.&quot;

In Latin America, on the one hand, according to John Nellis&#x27;s research for Center for Global Development, economic indicators, including firm profitability, productivity, and growth, project positive microeconomic results. On the other hand, however, privatisation has been largely met with a negative criticism and citizen coalitions. This neoliberal criticism highlights the ongoing conflict between varying visions of economic development. Karl Polanyi emphasizes the societal concerns of self-regulating markets through a concept known as a &quot;double movement&quot;. In essence, whenever societies move towards increasingly unrestrained, free-market rule, a natural and inevitable societal correction emerges to undermine the contradictions of capitalism. This was the case in the 2000 Cochabamba protests.

Privatization in Latin America has invariably experienced increasing push-back from the public. Mary Shirley from The Ronald Coase Institute suggests that implementing a less efficient but more politically mindful approach could be more sustainable.

In India, a survey by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) – Utilization of Free Medical Services by Children Belonging to the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) in Private Hospitals in New Delhi, 2011–12: A Rapid Appraisal – indicates under-utilization of the free beds available for EWS category in private hospitals in Delhi, though they were allotted land at subsidized rates.

In Australia a &quot;People&#x27;s Inquiry into Privatisation&quot; (2016/17) found that the impact of privatisation on communities was negative. The report from the inquiry &quot;Taking Back Control&quot; made a range of recommendations to provide accountability and transparency in the process. The report highlighted privatisation in healthcare, aged care, child care, social services, government departments, electricity, prisons and vocational education featuring the voices of workers, community members and academics.

Some reports show that the results of privatization are experienced differently between men and women for numerous reasons: when public services are privatized women are expected to take on the health and social care of dependents, women have less access to privatized goods, public sector employs a larger proportion of women than does the private sector, and the women in the public sector are more likely to be unionized than those in the private sector. In Chile, women are disproportionately affected by the privatization of the pension system because factors such as &quot;women&#x27;s longer life expectancy, earlier retirement age, and lower rates of labor-force participation, lower salaries&quot; affect their ability to accumulate funds for retirement which leads to lower pensions. Low-income women face an even greater burden; Anjela Taneja, of Oxfam India says &quot;The privatization of public services...implies limited or no access to essential services for women living in poverty, who are often the ones more in need of these services.&quot;

The increase in privatization since the 1980s has been a factor in rising income and wealth inequality in the United States.

==Foreign privatization==
Due to low levels of native capital accumulation in the former Central and Eastern Europe, the rapid privatization preferred by international institutions (EBRD, IMF, World Bank) and other foreign banks was a &quot;de facto&quot; call for international bidding, reflecting the assumption that foreign investment would play a major role.

===Contrasting cases in Eastern Europe: Romania and East Germany===
In post-reunification East Germany, by the end of June 1992, the &quot;Treuhandanstalt&quot; had privatized 8,175 companies, with 5,950 left on hand (4,340 remaining to be sold and the remainder to be liquidated). June 1992 was also when the last East German on the board of the &quot;Treuhand&quot; left. By the end of 1994, &quot;Treuhand&quot; had sold almost everything, having only 65 firms left to privatize as of December 1994. More than 80% of the privatized businesses were bought by foreigners (chiefly West Germans – 75%).

Romania&#x27;s first privatization took place on 3 August 1992. There was &quot;very little&quot; privatization during 1992: only 22 state-owned enterprises were privatized. The pace picked up throughout the following year, with more than 260 companies privatized. Four of the 22 enterprises privatized in 1992 were sold to foreign investors. In 1993, 265 companies were privatized, followed by 604 in 1994. Two companies were sold to foreign investors during this period, one each in 1993 and 1994. At the start of 1999, 4,330 companies were left to be privatized, with 5,476 having been sold during 1993–1998. At the end of 1998, only 2.4% of privatized companies had foreign participation.

== Opinion ==

Arguments for and against the controversial subject of privatization are presented here.

=== Support ===
Proponents of privatization argue that, over time, this can lead to lower prices, improved quality, more choices, less corruption, less red tape, and/or quicker delivery. Many proponents do not argue that everything should be privatized. According to them, market failures and natural monopolies could be problematic. However, anarcho-capitalists prefer that every function of the state be privatized, including defense and dispute resolution.

Proponents of privatization make the following arguments:
* Performance: state-run industries tend to be bureaucratic. A political government may only be motivated to improve a function when its poor performance becomes politically sensitive.
* Increased efficiency: private companies and firms have a greater incentive to produce goods and services more efficiently to increase profits.
* Specialization: a private business has the ability to focus all relevant human and financial resources onto specific functions. A state-owned firm does not have the necessary resources to specialize its goods and services as a result of the general products provided to the greatest number of people in the population.
* Improvements: conversely, the government may put off improvements due to political sensitivity and special interests—even in cases of companies that are run well and better serve their customers&#x27; needs.
* Corruption: a state-monopolized function is prone to corruption; decisions are made primarily for political reasons, personal gain of the decision-maker (i.e. &quot;graft&quot;), rather than economic ones. Corruption (or principal–agent issues) in a state-run corporation affects the ongoing asset stream and company performance, whereas any corruption that may occur during the privatization process is a one-time event and does not affect ongoing cash flow or performance of the company.
* Accountability: managers of privately owned companies are accountable to their owners/shareholders and to the consumer, and can only exist and thrive where needs are met. Managers of publicly owned companies are required to be more accountable to the broader community and to political &quot;stakeholders&quot;. This can reduce their ability to directly and specifically serve the needs of their customers, and can bias investment decisions away from otherwise profitable areas.
* Civil-liberty concerns: a company controlled by the state may have access to information or assets which may be used against dissidents or any individuals who disagree with their policies.
* Goals: a political government tends to run an industry or company for political goals rather than economic ones.
* Capital: a privately held companies can sometimes more easily raise investment capital in the financial markets when such local markets exist and are suitably liquid. While interest rates for private companies are often higher than for government debt, this can serve as a useful constraint to promote efficient investments by private companies, instead of cross-subsidizing them with the overall credit-risk of the country. Investment decisions are then governed by market interest rates. State-owned industries have to compete with demands from other government departments and special interests. In either case, for smaller markets, political risk may add substantially to the cost of capital.
* Security: governments have had the tendency to &quot;bail out&quot; poorly run businesses, often due to the sensitivity of job losses, when economically, it may be better to let the business fold.
* Lack of market discipline: poorly managed state companies are insulated from the same discipline as private companies, which could go bankrupt, have their management removed, or be taken over by competitors. Private companies are also able to take greater risks and then seek bankruptcy protection against creditors if those risks turn sour.
* Natural monopolies: the existence of natural monopolies does not mean that these sectors must be state owned. Governments can enact or are armed with anti-trust legislation and bodies to deal with anti-competitive behavior of all companies public or private.
* Concentration of wealth: ownership of and profits from successful enterprises tend to be dispersed and diversified—particularly in voucher privatization. The availability of more investment vehicles stimulates capital markets and promotes liquidity and job creation.
* Political influence: nationalized industries are prone to interference from politicians for political or populist reasons. Examples include making an industry buy supplies from local producers (when that may be more expensive than buying from abroad), forcing an industry to freeze its prices/fares to satisfy the electorate or control inflation, increasing its staffing to reduce unemployment, or moving its operations to marginal constituencies.
* Profits: corporations exist to generate profits for their shareholders. Private companies make a profit by enticing consumers to buy their products in preference to their competitors&#x27; (or by increasing primary demand for their products, or by reducing costs). Private corporations typically profit more if they serve the needs of their clients well. Corporations of different sizes may target different market niches in order to focus on marginal groups and satisfy their demand. A company with good corporate governance will therefore be incentivized to meet the needs of its customers efficiently.
* Job gains: as the economy becomes more efficient, more profits are obtained and no government subsidies and less taxes are needed, there will be more private money available for investments and consumption and more profitable and better-paid jobs will be created than in the case of a more regulated economy.

=== Opposition ===
Opponents of privatization in general—or of certain privatizations in particular—believe that public goods and services should remain primarily in the hands of government in order to ensure that everyone in society has access to them (such as law enforcement, basic health care, and basic education). There is a positive externality when the government provides society at large with public goods and services such as defense and disease control. Some national constitutions in effect define their governments&#x27; &quot;core businesses&quot; as being the provision of such things as justice, tranquility, defense, and general welfare. These governments&#x27; direct provision of security, stability, and safety, is intended to be done for the common good (in the public interest) with a long-term (for posterity) perspective. As for natural monopolies, opponents of privatization claim that they aren&#x27;t subject to fair competition, and better administrated by the state.

Although private companies may provide a similar good or service alongside the government, opponents of privatization are critical about completely transferring the provision of public goods, services and assets into private hands for the following reasons:
* Performance: a democratically elected government is accountable to the people through a legislature, Congress or Parliament, and is motivated to safeguarding the assets of the nation. The profit motive may be subordinated to social objectives.
* Improvements: the government is motivated to performance improvements as well run businesses contribute to the State&#x27;s revenues.
* Corruption: government ministers and civil servants are bound to uphold the highest ethical standards, and standards of probity are guaranteed through codes of conduct and declarations of interest. However, the selling process could lack transparency, allowing the purchaser and civil servants controlling the sale to gain personally.
* Accountability: the public has less control and oversight of private companies although these remain answerable to various stakeholders, including shareholders, clients, suppliers, regulators, employees and collaborators.
* Civil-liberty concerns: a democratically elected government is accountable to the people through a parliament, and can intervene when civil liberties are threatened.
* Goals: the government may seek to use state companies as instruments to further social goals for the benefit of the nation as a whole.
* Capital: governments can raise money in the financial markets most cheaply to re-lend to state-owned enterprises, although this preferential access to capital markets risks undermining financial discipline because of the assurance of a bailout from the government.
* Cuts in essential services: if a government-owned company providing an essential service (such as the water supply) to all citizens is privatized, its new owner(s) could lead to the abandoning of the social obligation to those who are less able to pay, or to regions where this service is unprofitable.
* Natural monopolies: privatization will not result in true competition if a natural monopoly exists.
* Concentration of wealth: profits from successful enterprises end up in private hands instead of being available for public use.
* Political influence: governments may more easily exert pressure on state-owned firms to help implement government policy.
* Profit: private companies do not have any goal other than to maximize profits.
* Privatization and poverty: it is acknowledged by many studies that there are winners and losers with privatization. The number of losers—which may add up to the size and severity of poverty—can be unexpectedly large if the method and process of privatization and how it is implemented are seriously flawed (e.g. lack of transparency leading to state-owned assets being appropriated at minuscule amounts by those with political connections, absence of regulatory institutions leading to transfer of monopoly rents from public to private sector, improper design and inadequate control of the privatization process leading to asset stripping).
* Job loss: due to the additional financial burden placed on privatized companies to succeed without any government help, unlike the public companies, jobs could be lost to keep more money in the company.
* Reduced wages and benefits: a 2014 report by In the Public Interest, a resource center on privatization, argues that &quot;outsourcing public services sets off a downward spiral in which reduced worker wages and benefits can hurt the local economy and overall stability of middle and working class communities.&quot;
* Inferior quality products: private, for-profit companies cut corners on providing quality goods and services in order to maximize profit.

== Economic theory ==
In economic theory, privatization has been studied in the field of contract theory. When contracts are complete, institutions such as (private or public) property are difficult to explain, since every desired incentive structure can be achieved with sufficiently complex contractual arrangements, regardless of the institutional structure. All that matters is who are the decision makers and what is their available information. In contrast, when contracts are incomplete, institutions matter. A leading application of the incomplete contract paradigm in the context of privatization is the model by Hart, Shleifer, and Vishny (1997). In their model, a manager can make investments to increase quality (but they may also increase costs) and investments to decrease costs (but they may also reduce quality). It turns out that it depends on the particular situation whether private ownership or public ownership is desirable. The Hart-Shleifer-Vishny model has been further developed in various directions, e.g. to allow for mixed public-private ownership and endogenous assignments of the investment tasks.

== Privatization of private companies ==
Privatization can also refer to the purchase of all outstanding shares of a publicly traded private company by private equity investors, which is more often called &quot;going private&quot;. The buyout withdraws the company&#x27;s shares from being traded at a public stock exchange. Depending on the involvement of internal and external investors, it may occur through a leveraged buyout or a management buyout, tender offer, or hostile takeover.

<text>A passage grave or passage tomb consists of one or more burial chambers covered in earth or stone and having a narrow access passage made of large stones. These structures usually date from the Neolithic Age and are found largely in Western Europe. When covered in earth, a passage grave is a type of burial mound which is found in various forms all over the world. When a passage grave is covered in stone, it is a type of cairn.

==Construction and design==
The building of passage graves was normally carried out with megaliths along with smaller stones. The earliest passage tombs seem to take the form of small dolmens, although not all dolmens are passage graves. The passage itself in a number of notable instances is aligned in such a way that the sun shines through the passage and into the chamber at a significant point in the year, often at sunrise on the winter solstice or at sunset on the equinox. Many later passage tombs were constructed at the tops of hills or mountains, indicating that their builders intended them to be seen from a great distance.

The interior of passage graves varies in number of burials, shape, and other aspects. Those with more than one chamber may have multiple sub-chambers leading off from the main burial chamber. One common interior layout, the cruciform passage grave, is cross-shaped, although prior to the Christian Era and thus having no Christian associations. Some passage tombs are covered with a cairn, especially those dating from later times. Passage tombs of the cairn type often have elaborate corbelled roofs rather than simple slabs. Megalithic art has been identified carved into the stones at some sites. Not all passage &quot;graves&quot; have been found to contain evidence that they were used for burial. One such example is Maeshowe.

==Origins and distribution==
The passage tomb tradition is believed to have originated in the French region of Brittany. It was introduced to other regions such as Ireland by colonists from Brittany.

In a 1961 survey of megalithic tombs in Ireland, Irish scholars Seán Ó Nualláin and Rúaidhrí de Valera describe four categories of megalithic tombs: court cairns, portal dolmens, wedge-shaped gallery graves, and passage tombs. This appears to be one of the first uses of the term. It is likely that the writers borrowed from the Spanish term &quot;tumbas de corredor&quot;, &quot;corridor tombs&quot;, which is used for tombs in Cantabria, Galicia and the Basque Country. Of the megalithic tombs in Ireland, only passage tombs appear to have widespread distribution throughout Europe.

Passage graves are distributed extensively in lands along the Atlantic seaboard of Europe. They are found in Ireland, Britain, Scandinavia, northern Germany and the Drenthe area of the Netherlands. They are also found in Iberia, some parts of the Mediterranean, and along the northern coast of Africa. In Ireland and Britain, passage tombs are often found in large clusters, giving rise to the term passage tomb cemeteries.

<text>In mathematics, specifically group theory, given a prime number &quot;p&quot;, a &quot;p&quot;-group is a group in which the order of every element is a power of &quot;p&quot;. That is, for each element &quot;g&quot; of a &quot;p&quot;-group &quot;G&quot;, there exists a nonnegative integer &quot;n&quot; such that the product of &quot;pn&quot; copies of &quot;g&quot;, and not fewer, is equal to the identity element. The orders of different elements may be different powers of &quot;p&quot;.

Abelian &quot;p&quot;-groups are also called &quot;p&quot;-primary or simply primary.

A finite group is a &quot;p&quot;-group if and only if its order (the number of its elements) is a power of &quot;p&quot;. Given a finite group &quot;G&quot;, the Sylow theorems guarantee the existence of a subgroup of &quot;G&quot; of order &quot;pn&quot; for every prime power &quot;pn&quot; that divides the order of &quot;G&quot;. 

Every finite &quot;p&quot;-group is nilpotent. 

The remainder of this article deals with finite &quot;p&quot;-groups. For an example of an infinite abelian &quot;p&quot;-group, see Prüfer group, and for an example of an infinite simple &quot;p&quot;-group, see Tarski monster group.

==Properties==

Every &quot;p&quot;-group is periodic since by definition every element has finite order.

If &quot;p&quot; is prime and &quot;G&quot; is a group of order &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; has a normal subgroup of order &quot;p&quot;&quot;m&quot; for every 1 ≤ &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;k&quot;. This follows by induction, using Cauchy&#x27;s theorem and the Correspondence Theorem for groups. A proof sketch is as follows: because the center &quot;Z&quot; of &quot;G&quot; is non-trivial (see below), according to Cauchy&#x27;s theorem &quot;Z&quot; has a subgroup &quot;H&quot; of order &quot;p&quot;. Being central in &quot;G&quot;, &quot;H&quot; is necessarily normal in &quot;G&quot;. We may now apply the inductive hypothesis to &quot;G/H&quot;, and the result follows from the Correspondence Theorem.

===Non-trivial center===
One of the first standard results using the class equation is that the center of a non-trivial finite &quot;p&quot;-group cannot be the trivial subgroup.

This forms the basis for many inductive methods in &quot;p&quot;-groups.

For instance, the normalizer &quot;N&quot; of a proper subgroup &quot;H&quot; of a finite &quot;p&quot;-group &quot;G&quot; properly contains &quot;H&quot;, because for any counterexample with &quot;H&quot; = &quot;N&quot;, the center &quot;Z&quot; is contained in &quot;N&quot;, and so also in &quot;H&quot;, but then there is a smaller example &quot;H&quot;/&quot;Z&quot; whose normalizer in &quot;G&quot;/&quot;Z&quot; is &quot;N&quot;/&quot;Z&quot; = &quot;H&quot;/&quot;Z&quot;, creating an infinite descent. As a corollary, every finite &quot;p&quot;-group is nilpotent.

In another direction, every normal subgroup &quot;N&quot; of a finite &quot;p&quot;-group intersects the center non-trivially as may be proved by considering the elements of &quot;N&quot; which are fixed when &quot;G&quot; acts on &quot;N&quot; by conjugation. Since every central subgroup is normal, it follows that every minimal normal subgroup of a finite &quot;p&quot;-group is central and has order &quot;p&quot;. Indeed, the socle of a finite &quot;p&quot;-group is the subgroup of the center consisting of the central elements of order &quot;p&quot;.

If &quot;G&quot; is a &quot;p&quot;-group, then so is &quot;G&quot;/&quot;Z&quot;, and so it too has a non-trivial center. The preimage in &quot;G&quot; of the center of &quot;G&quot;/&quot;Z&quot; is called the second center and these groups begin the upper central series. Generalizing the earlier comments about the socle, a finite &quot;p&quot;-group with order &quot;pn&quot; contains normal subgroups of order &quot;pi&quot; with 0 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;, and any normal subgroup of order &quot;pi&quot; is contained in the &quot;i&quot;th center &quot;Z&quot;&quot;i&quot;. If a normal subgroup is not contained in &quot;Z&quot;&quot;i&quot;, then its intersection with &quot;Z&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1 has size at least &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1.

===Automorphisms===
The automorphism groups of &quot;p&quot;-groups are well studied. Just as every finite &quot;p&quot;-group has a non-trivial center so that the inner automorphism group is a proper quotient of the group, every finite &quot;p&quot;-group has a non-trivial outer automorphism group. Every automorphism of &quot;G&quot; induces an automorphism on &quot;G&quot;/Φ(&quot;G&quot;), where Φ(&quot;G&quot;) is the Frattini subgroup of &quot;G&quot;. The quotient G/Φ(&quot;G&quot;) is an elementary abelian group and its automorphism group is a general linear group, so very well understood. The map from the automorphism group of &quot;G&quot; into this general linear group has been studied by Burnside, who showed that the kernel of this map is a &quot;p&quot;-group. 

==Examples==
&quot;p&quot;-groups of the same order are not necessarily isomorphic; for example, the cyclic group &quot;C&quot;4 and the Klein four-group &quot;V&quot;4 are both 2-groups of order 4, but they are not isomorphic.

Nor need a &quot;p&quot;-group be abelian; the dihedral group Dih4 of order 8 is a non-abelian 2-group. However, every group of order &quot;p&quot;2 is abelian.

The dihedral groups are both very similar to and very dissimilar from the quaternion groups and the semidihedral groups. Together the dihedral, semidihedral, and quaternion groups form the 2-groups of maximal class, that is those groups of order 2&quot;n&quot;+1 and nilpotency class &quot;n&quot;.

===Iterated wreath products===
The iterated wreath products of cyclic groups of order &quot;p&quot; are very important examples of &quot;p&quot;-groups. Denote the cyclic group of order &quot;p&quot; as &quot;W&quot;(1), and the wreath product of &quot;W&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) with &quot;W&quot;(1) as &quot;W&quot;(&quot;n&quot; + 1). Then &quot;W&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup of the symmetric group Sym(&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;). Maximal &quot;p&quot;-subgroups of the general linear group GL(&quot;n&quot;,Q) are direct products of various &quot;W&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). It has order &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; where &quot;k&quot; = (&quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1)/(&quot;p&quot; − 1). It has nilpotency class &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1, and its lower central series, upper central series, lower exponent-&quot;p&quot; central series, and upper exponent-&quot;p&quot; central series are equal. It is generated by its elements of order &quot;p&quot;, but its exponent is &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;. The second such group, &quot;W&quot;(2), is also a &quot;p&quot;-group of maximal class, since it has order &quot;p&quot;&quot;p&quot;+1 and nilpotency class &quot;p&quot;, but is not a regular &quot;p&quot;-group. Since groups of order &quot;p&quot;&quot;p&quot; are always regular groups, it is also a minimal such example.

===Generalized dihedral groups===
When &quot;p&quot; = 2 and &quot;n&quot; = 2, &quot;W&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is the dihedral group of order 8, so in some sense &quot;W&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) provides an analogue for the dihedral group for all primes &quot;p&quot; when &quot;n&quot; = 2. However, for higher &quot;n&quot; the analogy becomes strained. There is a different family of examples that more closely mimics the dihedral groups of order 2&quot;n&quot;, but that requires a bit more setup. Let ζ denote a primitive &quot;p&quot;th root of unity in the complex numbers, let Z[ζ] be the ring of cyclotomic integers generated by it, and let &quot;P&quot; be the prime ideal generated by 1−ζ. Let &quot;G&quot; be a cyclic group of order &quot;p&quot; generated by an element &quot;z&quot;. Form the semidirect product &quot;E&quot;(&quot;p&quot;) of Z[ζ] and &quot;G&quot; where &quot;z&quot; acts as multiplication by ζ. The powers &quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot; are normal subgroups of &quot;E&quot;(&quot;p&quot;), and the example groups are &quot;E&quot;(&quot;p&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;E&quot;(&quot;p&quot;)/&quot;P&quot;&quot;n&quot;. &quot;E&quot;(&quot;p&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) has order &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;+1 and nilpotency class &quot;n&quot;, so is a &quot;p&quot;-group of maximal class. When &quot;p&quot; = 2, &quot;E&quot;(2,&quot;n&quot;) is the dihedral group of order 2&quot;n&quot;. When &quot;p&quot; is odd, both &quot;W&quot;(2) and &quot;E&quot;(&quot;p&quot;,&quot;p&quot;) are irregular groups of maximal class and order &quot;p&quot;&quot;p&quot;+1, but are not isomorphic.

===Unitriangular matrix groups===

The Sylow subgroups of general linear groups are another fundamental family of examples. Let &quot;V&quot; be a vector space of dimension &quot;n&quot; with basis { &quot;e&quot;1, &quot;e&quot;2, ..., &quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot; } and define &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; to be the vector space generated by { &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot;+1, ..., &quot;e&quot;&quot;n&quot; } for 1 ≤ &quot;i&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;, and define &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; = 0 when &quot;i&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;. For each 1 ≤ &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;n&quot;, the set of invertible linear transformations of &quot;V&quot; which take each &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot; to &quot;V&quot;&quot;i&quot;+&quot;m&quot; form a subgroup of Aut(&quot;V&quot;) denoted &quot;U&quot;&quot;m&quot;. If &quot;V&quot; is a vector space over Z/&quot;p&quot;Z, then &quot;U&quot;1 is a Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup of Aut(&quot;V&quot;) = GL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;p&quot;), and the terms of its lower central series are just the &quot;U&quot;&quot;m&quot;. In terms of matrices, &quot;U&quot;&quot;m&quot; are those upper triangular matrices with 1s one the diagonal and 0s on the first &quot;m&quot;−1 superdiagonals. The group &quot;U&quot;1 has order &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot;·(&quot;n&quot;−1)/2, nilpotency class &quot;n&quot;, and exponent &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot; where &quot;k&quot; is the least integer at least as large as the base &quot;p&quot; logarithm of &quot;n&quot;.

==Classification==
The groups of order &quot;p&quot;&quot;n&quot; for 0 ≤ &quot;n&quot; ≤ 4 were classified early in the history of group theory, and modern work has extended these classifications to groups whose order divides &quot;p&quot;7, though the sheer number of families of such groups grows so quickly that further classifications along these lines are judged difficult for the human mind to comprehend. For example, Marshall Hall Jr. and James K. Senior classified groups of order 2&quot;n&quot; for &quot;n&quot; ≤ 6 in 1964.

Rather than classify the groups by order, Philip Hall proposed using a notion of isoclinism of groups which gathered finite &quot;p&quot;-groups into families based on large quotient and subgroups.

An entirely different method classifies finite &quot;p&quot;-groups by their coclass, that is, the difference between their composition length and their nilpotency class. The so-called coclass conjectures described the set of all finite &quot;p&quot;-groups of fixed coclass as perturbations of finitely many pro-p groups. The coclass conjectures were proven in the 1980s using techniques related to Lie algebras and powerful p-groups. The final proofs of the coclass theorems are due to A. Shalev and independently to C. R. Leedham-Green, both in 1994. They admit a classification of finite &quot;p&quot;-groups in directed coclass graphs consisting of only finitely many coclass trees whose (infinitely many) members are characterized by finitely many parametrized presentations.

Every group of order &quot;p&quot;5 is metabelian.

===Up to &quot;p&quot;3===
The trivial group is the only group of order one, and the cyclic group C&quot;p&quot; is the only group of order &quot;p&quot;. There are exactly two groups of order &quot;p&quot;2, both abelian, namely C&quot;p&quot;2 and C&quot;p&quot; × C&quot;p&quot;. For example, the cyclic group C4 and the Klein four-group &quot;V&quot;4 which is C2 × C2 are both 2-groups of order 4.

There are three abelian groups of order &quot;p&quot;3, namely C&quot;p&quot;3, C&quot;p&quot;2 × C&quot;p&quot;, and C&quot;p&quot; × C&quot;p&quot; × C&quot;p&quot;. There are also two non-abelian groups.

For &quot;p&quot; ≠ 2, one is a semi-direct product of C&quot;p&quot; × C&quot;p&quot; with C&quot;p&quot;, and the other is a semi-direct product of C&quot;p&quot;2 with C&quot;p&quot;. The first one can be described in other terms as group UT(3,&quot;p&quot;) of unitriangular matrices over finite field with &quot;p&quot; elements, also called the Heisenberg group mod &quot;p&quot;.

For &quot;p&quot; = 2, both the semi-direct products mentioned above are isomorphic to the dihedral group Dih4 of order 8. The other non-abelian group of order 8 is the quaternion group Q8.

==Prevalence==

=== Among groups ===
The number of isomorphism classes of groups of order &quot;pn&quot; grows as formula_1, and these are dominated by the classes that are two-step nilpotent. Because of this rapid growth, there is a folklore conjecture asserting that almost all finite groups are 2-groups: the fraction of isomorphism classes of 2-groups among isomorphism classes of groups of order at most &quot;n&quot; is thought to tend to 1 as &quot;n&quot; tends to infinity. For instance, of the 49 910 529 484 different groups of order at most 2000, , or just over 99%, are 2-groups of order 1024.

=== Within a group ===
Every finite group whose order is divisible by &quot;p&quot; contains a subgroup which is a non-trivial &quot;p&quot;-group, namely a cyclic group of order &quot;p&quot; generated by an element of order &quot;p&quot; obtained from Cauchy&#x27;s theorem. In fact, it contains a &quot;p&quot;-group of maximal possible order: if formula_2 where &quot;p&quot; does not divide &quot;m,&quot; then &quot;G&quot; has a subgroup &quot;P&quot; of order formula_3 called a Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup. This subgroup need not be unique, but any subgroups of this order are conjugate, and any &quot;p&quot;-subgroup of &quot;G&quot; is contained in a Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup. This and other properties are proved in the Sylow theorems.

== Application to structure of a group ==
&quot;p&quot;-groups are fundamental tools in understanding the structure of groups and in the classification of finite simple groups. &quot;p&quot;-groups arise both as subgroups and as quotient groups. As subgroups, for a given prime &quot;p&quot; one has the Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroups &quot;P&quot; (largest &quot;p&quot;-subgroup not unique but all conjugate) and the &quot;p&quot;-core formula_4 (the unique largest &quot;normal&quot; &quot;p&quot;-subgroup), and various others. As quotients, the largest &quot;p&quot;-group quotient is the quotient of &quot;G&quot; by the &quot;p&quot;-residual subgroup formula_5 These groups are related (for different primes), possess important properties such as the focal subgroup theorem, and allow one to determine many aspects of the structure of the group.

=== Local control ===
Much of the structure of a finite group is carried in the structure of its so-called local subgroups, the normalizers of non-identity &quot;p&quot;-subgroups.

The large elementary abelian subgroups of a finite group exert control over the group that was used in the proof of the Feit–Thompson theorem. Certain central extensions of elementary abelian groups called extraspecial groups help describe the structure of groups as acting on symplectic vector spaces.

Richard Brauer classified all groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups are the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 4, and John Walter, Daniel Gorenstein, Helmut Bender, Michio Suzuki, George Glauberman, and others classified those simple groups whose Sylow 2-subgroups were abelian, dihedral, semidihedral, or quaternion.

<text>Pope Innocent XII (; ; 13 March 1615 – 27 September 1700), born Antonio Pignatelli, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 12 July 1691 to his death in September 1700.

He took a hard stance against nepotism in the Church, continuing the policies of Pope Innocent XI, who started the battle against nepotism but which did not gain traction under Pope Alexander VIII. To that end, he issued a papal bull strictly forbidding it. The pope also used this bull to ensure that no revenue or land could be bestowed on relatives.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Antonio Pignatelli was born on 13 March 1615 in Spinazzola (now in Apulia) to one of the most aristocratic families of the Kingdom of Naples, which had included several Viceroys and ministers of the crown. He was the fourth of five children of Francesco Pignatelli, 4th Marquess of Spinazzola, and wife Porzia Carafa, 1st Princess of Minervino. His siblings were Marzio, Ludovico, Fabrizio and Paola Maria. His mother was related to Pope Paul IV.

He was educated at the Collegio Romano in Rome where he earned a doctorate in both canon and civil law.

===Diplomatic career===
At the age of 20 he became an official of the court of Pope Urban VIII. Pignatelli was the Referendary of the Apostolic Signatura and served as the governor of Fano and Viterbo. Later he went to Malta where he served as an inquisitor from 1646 to 1649, and then governor of Perugia. Shortly after this, he received his priestly ordination.

===Episcopate and cardinalate===

Pignatelli was made Titular Archbishop of Larissa in 1652 and received episcopal consecration in Rome. He served as the Apostolic Nuncio to Poland from 1660 to 1668 and later to Austria from 1668 to 1671. He was transferred to Lecce in 1671. Pope Innocent XI appointed him as the Cardinal-Priest of San Pancrazio in 1681 and then moved him to the see of Faenza in 1682. He was moved to his final post before the papacy, as Archbishop of Naples in 1686.

==Papacy==
===Papal election===
Pope Alexander VIII died in 1691 and the College of Cardinals assembled to hold a conclave to select his successor. Factions loyal to the Kingdom of France, Spain and the broader Holy Roman Empire failed to agree on a consensus candidate.

After five months, Cardinal Pignatelli emerged as a compromise candidate between the cardinals of France and those of the Holy Roman Empire, particularly after Cardinal Gregorio Barbarigo was no longer considered a viable candidate for the papacy. Having received 53 out of 61 votes, Pignatelli took his new name in honour of Pope Innocent XI and was crowned on 15 July 1691 by the protodeacon, Cardinal Urbano Sacchetti. He took possession of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran on 13 April 1692.

===Actions===
Immediately after his election on 12 July 1691, Innocent XII declared his opposition to the nepotism which had afflicted the reigns of previous popes. The following year he issued the papal bull, &quot;Romanum decet Pontificem&quot;, banning the curial office of the Cardinal-Nephew and prohibiting popes from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative. Further, only one relative (and only &quot;if otherwise suitable&quot;) was to be raised to the cardinalate.

At the same time he sought to check the simony in the practices of the Apostolic Chamber and to that end introduced a simpler and more economical manner of life into his court. Innocent XII said that &quot;the poor were his nephews&quot; and compared his public beneficence to the nepotism of many predecessors.

That same year he invited Marcello Malpighi to Rome to serve as his personal physician and offered him the position of Professor of Medicine at the Sapienza University of Rome. Malpighi introduced his Roman colleagues to the use of the microscope. 

Innocent XII also introduced various reforms into the States of the Church including the &quot;Forum Innocentianum&quot;, designed to improve the administration of justice dispensed by the Church. In 1693 he compelled French bishops to retract the four propositions relating to the Gallican Liberties which had been formulated by the assembly of 1682.

In 1699, he decided in favour of Jacques-Benigne Bossuet in that prelate&#x27;s controversy with Fénelon about the &quot;Explication des Maximes des Saints sur la Vie Intérieure&quot; of the latter. Innocent XII&#x27;s pontificate also differed greatly from his predecessors&#x27; because of his leanings towards France instead of the Habsburg monarchy; the first in the 20 years following France&#x27;s failure to have its candidate elected in 1644 and 1655.

====Consistories====

Innocent XII created 30 cardinals in four consistories; two of those he elevated were those he reserved &quot;in pectore&quot;.

====Canonizations and beatifications====
Innocent XII canonized Saint Zita of Lucca on 5 September 1696. He beatified Augustin Kažotić on 17 July 1700 and approved the cultus of Angela of Foligno in 1693. He also beatified Osanna Andreasi on 24 November 1694, Mary de Cervellione on 13 February 1692, Jane of Portugal on 31 December 1692, Umiliana de&#x27; Cerchi on 24 July 1694, Helen Enselmini on 29 October 1695, and Delphine of Glandèves in 1694.

===Death===

Innocent XII was already considerably ill on 25 December 1699 with gout (a rheumatic disease) and was therefore unable to attend the solemn opening of the Holy Door at Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica to mark the beginning of the Jubilee for 1700, hence, Cardinal Emmanuel-Théodose de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne represented the pontiff in the solemn celebration. On Easter Sunday in 1700, the seriously ill pontiff gave a blessing from his balcony to the large crowds outside of the Quirinal Palace. Despite his illness, he named three new cardinals in June 1700.

Innocent died on 27 September 1700 and was succeeded in the next conclave by Pope Clement XI (1700–21). His tomb in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica was sculpted by Filippo della Valle.

==In fiction==
Innocent appears as one of the narrators in Robert Browning&#x27;s long poem &quot;The Ring and the Book&quot; (1869), based on the true story of the pope&#x27;s intervention in a historical murder trial in Rome during his papacy. Innocent is the most recent pope to not be clean shaven.

<doc id="24667" wikidata="Q2746739" url="?curid=24667" title="Protein phosphatase">
<text>A protein phosphatase is a phosphatase enzyme that removes a phosphate group from the phosphorylated amino acid residue of its substrate protein. Protein phosphorylation is one of the most common forms of reversible protein posttranslational modification (PTM), with up to 30% of all proteins being phosphorylated at any given time. Protein kinases (PKs) are the effectors of phosphorylation and catalyse the transfer of a γ-phosphate from ATP to specific amino acids on proteins. Several hundred PKs exist in mammals and are classified into distinct super-families. Proteins are phosphorylated predominantly on Ser, Thr and Tyr residues, which account for 79.3, 16.9 and 3.8% respectively of the phosphoproteome, at least in mammals. In contrast, protein phosphatases (PPs) are the primary effectors of dephosphorylation and can be grouped into three main classes based on sequence, structure and catalytic function. The largest class of PPs is the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) family comprising PP1, PP2A, PP2B, PP4, PP5, PP6 and PP7, and the protein phosphatase Mg2+- or Mn2+-dependent (PPM) family, composed primarily of PP2C. The protein Tyr phosphatase (PTP) super-family forms the second group, and the aspartate-based protein phosphatases the third. The protein pseudophosphatases form part of the larger phosphatase family, and in most cases are thought to be catalytically inert, instead functioning as phosphate-binding proteins, integrators of signalling or subcellular traps. Examples of membrane-spanning protein phosphatases containing both active (phosphatase) and inactive (pseudophosphatase) domains linked in tandem are known, conceptually similar to the kinase and pseudokinase domain polypeptide structure of the JAK pseudokinases. A complete comparative analysis of human phosphatases and pseudophosphatases has been completed by Manning and colleagues, forming a companion piece to the ground-breaking analysis of the human kinome, which encodes the complete set of ~536 human protein kinases.

==Mechanism==
Phosphorylation involves the transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to the enzyme, the energy for which comes from hydrolysing ATP into ADP or AMP. However, dephosphorylation releases phosphates into solution as free ions, because attaching them back to ATP would require energy input.

Cysteine-dependent phosphatases (CDPs) catalyse the hydrolysis of a phosphoester bond via a phospho-cysteine intermediate.

The free cysteine nucleophile forms a bond with the phosphorus atom of the phosphate moiety, and the P-O bond linking the phosphate group to the tyrosine is protonated, either by a suitably positioned acidic amino acid residue (Asp in the diagram below) or a water molecule. The phospho-cysteine intermediate is then hydrolysed by another water molecule, thus regenerating the active site for another dephosphorylation reaction.

Metallo-phosphatases (e.g. PP2C) co-ordinate 2 catalytically essential metal ions within their active site. There is currently some confusion of the identity of these metal ions, as successive attempts to identify them yield different answers. There is currently evidence that these metals could be magnesium, manganese, iron, zinc, or any combination thereof. It is thought that a hydroxyl ion bridging the two metal ions takes part in nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus ion.

==Sub-types==
Phosphatases can be subdivided based upon their substrate specificity. 


===Serine/threonine PP (PPM/PPP) families===

Protein Ser/Thr phosphatases were originally classified using biochemical assays as either, type 1 (PP1) or type 2 (PP2), and were further subdivided based on metal-ion requirement (PP2A, no metal ion; PP2B, Ca2+ stimulated; PP2C, Mg2+ dependent) (Moorhead et al., 2007). The protein Ser/Thr phosphatases PP1, PP2A and PP2B of the PPP family, together with PP2C of the PPM family, account for the majority of Ser/Thr PP activity in vivo (Barford et al., 1998). In the brain, they are present in different subcellular compartments in neuronal and glial cells, and contribute to different neuronal functions.

===PPM===
The PPM family, which includes PP2C and pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase, are enzymes with Mn2+/Mg2+ metal ions that are resistant to classic inhibitors and toxins of the PPP family. Unlike most PPPs, PP2C exists in only one subunit but, like PTPs, it displays a wide variety of structural domains that confer unique functions. In addition, PP2C does not seem to be evolutionarily related to the major family of Ser/Thr PPs and has no sequence homology to ancient PPP enzymes. The current assumption is that PPMs evolved separately from PPPs but converged during evolutionary development.

===Class I: Cys-based PTPs===
Class I PTPs constitute the largest family. They contain the well-known classical receptor (a) and non-receptor PTPs (b), which are strictly tyrosine-specific, and the DSPs (c) which target Ser/Thr as well as Tyr and are the most diverse in terms of substrate specificity.

===Class III: Cys-based PTPs===
The third class of PTPs contains three cell cycle regulators, CDC25A, CDC25B and CDC25C, which dephosphorylate CDKs at their N-terminal, a reaction required to drive progression of the cell cycle. They are themselves regulated by phosphorylation and are degraded in response to DNA damage to prevent chromosomal abnormalities.

===Class IV: Asp-based DSPs===
The haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily is a further PP group that uses Asp as a nucleophile and was recently shown to have dual-specificity. These PPs can target both Ser and Tyr, but are thought to have greater specificity towards Tyr. A subfamily of HADs, the Eyes Absent Family (Eya), are also transcription factors and can therefore regulate their own phosphorylation and that of transcriptional cofactor/s, and contribute to the control of gene transcription. The combination of these two functions in Eya reveals a greater complexity of transcriptional gene control than previously thought . A further member of this class is the RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain phosphatase. While this family remains poorly understood, it is known to play important roles in development and nuclear morphology.

==Alternative Structural Classification==
Many phosphatases are promiscuous with respect to substrate type, or can evolve quickly to change substrate. An alternative structural classification notes that 20 distinct protein folds have phosphatase activity, and 10 of these contain protein phosphatases.
* The CC1 fold is the most common, and includes tyrosine-specific (PTP), dual-specific (DSP) and even lipid-specific (PTEN) families.
* The major serine/threonine-specific folds are PPM (PP2C) and PPPL (PPP).
* The only known histidine phosphatases is in the PHP fold.
* Other folds encode phosphatases that act on various combination of pSer, pThr, pTyr, and non-protein substrates (CC2, CC3, HAD, HP, AP, RTR1).

==Physiological relevance==
Phosphatases act in opposition to kinases/phosphorylases, which add phosphate groups to proteins. The addition of a phosphate group may activate or de-activate an enzyme (e.g., kinase signalling pathways) or enable a protein-protein interaction to occur (e.g., SH2 domains ); therefore phosphatases are integral to many signal transduction pathways. Phosphate addition and removal do not necessarily correspond to enzyme activation or inhibition, and that several enzymes have separate phosphorylation sites for activating or inhibiting functional regulation. CDK, for example, can be either activated or deactivated depending on the specific amino acid residue being phosphorylated. Phosphates are important in signal transduction because they regulate the proteins to which they are attached. To reverse the regulatory effect, the phosphate is removed. This occurs on its own by hydrolysis, or is mediated by protein phosphatases.

Protein phosphorylation plays a crucial role in biological functions and controls nearly every cellular process, including metabolism, gene transcription and translation, cell-cycle progression, cytoskeletal rearrangement, protein-protein interactions, protein stability, cell movement, and apoptosis. These processes depend on the highly regulated and opposing actions of PKs and PPs, through changes in the phosphorylation of key proteins. Histone phosphorylation, along with methylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation and acetylation, also regulates access to DNA through chromatin reorganisation.

One of the major switches for neuronal activity is the activation of PKs and PPs by elevated intracellular calcium. The degree of activation of the various isoforms of PKs and PPs is controlled by their individual sensitivities to calcium. Furthermore, a wide range of specific inhibitors and targeting partners such as scaffolding, anchoring, and adaptor proteins also contribute to the control of PKs and PPs and recruit them into signalling complexes in neuronal cells. Such signalling complexes typically act to bring PKs and PPs in close proximity with target substrates and signalling molecules as well as enhance their selectivity by restricting accessibility to these substrate proteins. Phosphorylation events, therefore, are controlled not only by the balanced activity of PKs and PPs but also by their restricted localisation. Regulatory subunits and domains serve to restrict specific proteins to particular subcellular compartments and to modulate protein specificity. These regulators are essential for maintaining the coordinated action of signalling cascades, which in neuronal cells include short-term (synaptic) and long-term (nuclear) signalling. These functions are, in part, controlled by allosteric modification by secondary messengers and reversible protein phosphorylation.

It is thought that around 30% of known PPs are present in all tissues, with the rest showing some level of tissue restriction. While protein phosphorylation is a cell-wide regulatory mechanism, recent quantitative proteomics studies have shown that phosphorylation preferentially targets nuclear proteins. Many PPs that regulate nuclear events, are often enriched or exclusively present in the nucleus. In neuronal cells, PPs are present in multiple cellular compartments and play a critical role at both pre- and post-synapses, in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus where they regulate gene expression.

Phosphoprotein phosphatase is activated by the hormone insulin, which indicates that there is a high concentration of glucose in the blood. The enzyme then acts to dephosphorylate other enzymes, such as phosphorylase kinase, glycogen phosphorylase, and glycogen synthase. This leads to phosphorylase kinase and glycogen phosphorylase&#x27;s becoming inactive, while glycogen synthase is activated. As a result, glycogen synthesis is increased and glycogenolysis is decreased, and the net effect is for energy to enter and be stored inside the cell.

==Learning and memory==

In the adult brain, PPs are essential for synaptic functions and are involved in the negative regulation of higher-order brain functions such as learning and memory. Dysregulation of their activity has been linked to several disorders including cognitive ageing and neurodegeneration, as well as cancer, diabetes and obesity.

<text>The Pentium (also referred to as the i586 or P5 Pentium) is a microprocessor introduced by Intel on March 22, 1993. It is the first CPU using the Pentium brand. 
Considered the fifth generation in the x86 (8086) compatible line of processors, succeeding the i486, its implementation and microarchitecture was internally called &quot;P5&quot;. 

Like the Intel i486, the Pentium is instruction set compatible with the 32-bit i386. It uses a very similar microarchitecture to the i486, but was extended enough to implement a dual integer pipeline design, as well as a more advanced floating-point unit (FPU) that was noted to be ten times faster than its predecessor. 

The Pentium was succeeded by the Pentium Pro in November 1995. In October 1996, the Pentium MMX was introduced, complementing the same basic microarchitecture of the original Pentium with the MMX instruction set, larger caches, and some other enhancements. Intel discontinued the P5 Pentium processors (sold as a cheaper product since the release of the Pentium II in 1997) in early 2000 in favor of the Celeron processor, which had also replaced the 80486 brand.

== Overview ==
The P5 Pentium is the first superscalar x86 processor, meaning it was often able to execute two instructions at the same time. Some techniques used to implement this were based on the earlier superscalar Intel i960 CA (1989), while other details were invented exclusively for the P5 design. Large parts were also copied from the i386 or i486, especially the strategies used to cope with the complicated x86 encodings in a pipelined fashion. Just like the i486, the Pentium used both an optimized microcode system and RISC-like techniques, depending on the particular instruction, or part of instruction. The dual integer pipeline design is something that had been argued being impossible to implement for a CISC instruction set, by certain academics and RISC competitors.

Other central features include a redesigned and significantly faster floating-point unit, a wide 64-bit data bus (external as well as internal), separate code and data caches, and many other techniques and features to enhance performance. 

The P5 also has better support for multiprocessing compared to the i486, and is the first x86 CPU with hardware support for it similar to IBM mainframe computers. Intel worked with IBM to define this ability and also designed it into the P5 microarchitecture. This ability was absent in prior x86 generations and x86 processors from competitors.

In order to employ the dual pipelines at their full potential, certain compilers were optimized to better exploit instruction level parallelism, although not all applications would substantially gain from being recompiled. The faster FPU always enhanced floating point performance significantly though, compared to the i486 or i387. Intel spent resources working with development tool vendors, ISVs and operating system (OS) companies to optimize their products.

Competitors included the superscalar PowerPC 601 (1993), SuperSPARC (1992), DEC Alpha 21064 (1992), AMD 29050 (1990), Motorola MC88110 (1991) and Motorola 68060 (1994), most of which also used a superscalar in-order dual instruction pipeline configuration, and the non-superscalar Motorola 68040 (1990) and MIPS R4000 (1991).

=== Etymology ===
The name &quot;Pentium&quot; is originally derived from the Greek word &quot;&quot; (&quot;πέντε&quot;), meaning &quot;five&quot;, a reference to the prior numeric naming convention of Intel&#x27;s 80x86 processors (8086–80486), with the Latin ending &quot;-ium&quot; since the processor would otherwise have been named 80586 using that convention.

==Development==
The P5 microarchitecture was designed by the same Santa Clara team which designed the 386 and 486. Design work started in 1989; the team decided to use a superscalar RISC architecture which would be a convergence of RISC and CISC technology, with on-chip cache, floating-point, and branch prediction. The preliminary design was first successfully simulated in 1990, followed by the laying-out of the design. By this time, the team had several dozen engineers. The design was taped out, or transferred to silicon, in April 1992, at which point beta-testing began. By mid-1992, the P5 team had 200 engineers. Intel at first planned to demonstrate the P5 in June 1992 at the trade show PC Expo, and to formally announce the processor in September 1992, but design problems forced the demo to be cancelled, and the official introduction of the chip was delayed until the spring of 1993.

John H. Crawford, chief architect of the original 386, co-managed the design of the P5, along with Donald Alpert, who managed the architectural team. Dror Avnon managed the design of the FPU. Vinod K. Dham was general manager of the P5 group.

Intel&#x27;s Larrabee multicore architecture project uses a processor core derived from a P5 core (P54C), augmented by multithreading, 64-bit instructions, and a 16-byte wide vector processing unit. Intel&#x27;s low-powered Bonnell microarchitecture employed in early Atom processor cores also uses an in-order dual pipeline similar to P5.

Intel used the Pentium name instead of 586, because in 1991, it had lost a trademark dispute over the &quot;386&quot; trademark, when a judge ruled that the number was generic. The company hired Lexicon Branding to come up with a new, non-numeric name.

===Improvements over the i486===
The P5 microarchitecture brings several important advances over the prior i486 architecture.

** Superscalar architecture – The Pentium has two datapaths (pipelines) that allow it to complete two instructions per clock cycle in many cases. The main pipe (U) can handle any instruction, while the other (V) can handle the most common simple instructions. Some reduced instruction set computer (RISC) proponents had argued that the &quot;complicated&quot; x86 instruction set would probably never be implemented by a tightly pipelined microarchitecture, much less by a dual-pipeline design. The 486 and the Pentium demonstrated that this was indeed possible and feasible.
** 64-bit external databus doubles the amount of information possible to read or write on each memory access and therefore allows the Pentium to load its code cache faster than the 80486; it also allows faster access and storage of 64-bit and 80-bit x87 FPU data.
** Separation of code and data caches lessens the fetch and operand read/write conflicts compared to the 486. To reduce access time and implementation cost, both of them are 2-way associative, instead of the single 4-way cache of the 486. A related enhancement in the Pentium is the ability to read a contiguous block from the code cache even when it is split between two cache lines (at least 17 bytes in worst case).
** Much faster floating-point unit. Some instructions showed an enormous improvement, most notably FMUL, with up to 15 times higher throughput than in the 80486 FPU. The Pentium is also able to execute a FXCH ST(x) instruction in parallel with an ordinary (arithmetical or load/store) FPU instruction.
** Four-input address adders enables the Pentium to further reduce the address calculation latency compared to the 80486. The Pentium can calculate full addressing modes with &quot;segment-base&quot; + &quot;base-register&quot; + &quot;scaled register&quot; + &quot;immediate offset&quot; in a single cycle; the 486 has a three-input address adder only, and must therefore divide such calculations between two cycles.
** The microcode can employ both pipelines to enable auto-repeating instructions such as REP MOVSW perform one iteration every clock cycle, while the 80486 needed three clocks per iteration (and the earliest x86 chips significantly more than the 486). Also, optimization of the access to the first microcode words during the decode stages helps in making several frequent instructions execute significantly more quickly, especially in their most common forms and in typical cases. Some examples are (486→Pentium, in clock cycles): CALL (3→1), RET (5→2), shifts/rotates (2–3→1).
** A faster, fully hardware-based multiplier makes instructions such as MUL and IMUL several times faster (and more predictable) than in the 80486; the execution time is reduced from 13 to 42 clock cycles down to 10–11 for 32-bit operands.
** Virtualized interrupt to speed up virtual 8086 mode.
** Branch prediction
* &quot;Other features&quot;:
** Enhanced debug features with the introduction of the Processor-based debug port (see &quot;Pentium Processor Debugging&quot; in the Developers Manual, Vol 1).
** Enhanced self-test features like the L1 cache parity check (see &quot;Cache Structure&quot; in the Developers Manual, Vol 1).
** New instructions: CPUID, CMPXCHG8B, RDTSC, RDMSR, WRMSR, RSM.
** Test registers TR0–TR7 and MOV instructions for access to them were eliminated.
* The later Pentium MMX also added the MMX instruction set, a basic integer &quot;single instruction, multiple data&quot; (SIMD) instruction set extension marketed for use in multimedia applications. MMX could not be used simultaneously with the x87 FPU instructions because the registers were reused (to allow fast context switches). More important enhancements were the doubling of the instruction and data cache sizes and a few microarchitectural changes for better performance.

The Pentium was designed to execute over 100 million instructions per second (MIPS), and the 75 MHz model was able to reach 126.5 MIPS in certain benchmarks. The Pentium architecture typically offered just under twice the performance of a 486 processor per clock cycle in common benchmarks. The fastest 80486 parts (with slightly improved microarchitecture and 100 MHz operation) were almost as powerful as the first-generation Pentiums, and the AMD Am5x86, which despite its name is actually a 486-class CPU, was roughly equal to the Pentium 75 regarding pure ALU performance.

===Errata===
The early versions of 60–66 MHz P5 Pentiums had a problem in the floating-point unit that resulted in incorrect (but predictable) results from some division operations. This flaw, discovered in 1994 by professor Thomas Nicely at Lynchburg College, Virginia, became widely known as the Pentium FDIV bug and caused embarrassment for Intel, which created an exchange program to replace the faulty processors.

In 1997, another erratum was discovered that could allow a malicious program to crash a system without any special privileges, the &quot;F00F bug&quot;. All P5 series processors were affected and no fixed steppings were ever released, however contemporary operating systems were patched with workarounds to prevent crashes.

==Cores and steppings==
The Pentium was Intel&#x27;s primary microprocessor for personal computers during the mid-1990s. The original design was reimplemented in newer processes and new features were added to maintain its competitiveness, and to address specific markets such as portable computers. As a result, there were several variants of the P5 microarchitecture.

===P5===

The first Pentium microprocessor core was code-named &quot;P5&quot;. Its product code was 80501 (80500 for the earliest steppings Q0399). There were two versions, specified to operate at 60 MHz and 66 MHz respectively, using Socket 4. This first implementation of the Pentium was released using a 273-pin PGA form factor and ran on a 5v power supply. (descended from the usual transistor-transistor logic (TTL) compatibility requirements). It contained 3.1 million transistors and measured 16.7 mm by 17.6 mm for an area of 293.92 mm2. It was fabricated in a 800 nm bipolar complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (BiCMOS) process. The 5-volt design resulted in relatively high energy consumption for its operating frequency when compared to the directly following models.

===P54C===

The P5 was followed by the P54C (80502) in 1994, with versions specified to operate at 75, 90, or 100 MHz using a 3.3 volt power supply. Marking the switch to Socket 5, this was the first Pentium processor to operate at 3.3 volts, reducing energy consumption, but necessitating voltage regulation on mainboards. As with higher-clocked 486 processors, an internal clock multiplier was employed from here on to let the internal circuitry work at a higher frequency than the external address and data buses, as it is more complicated and cumbersome to increase the external frequency, due to physical constraints. It also allowed two-way multiprocessing, and had an integrated local APIC and new power management features. It contained 3.3 million transistors and measured 163 mm2. It was fabricated in a BiCMOS process which has been described as both 500 nm and 600 nm due to differing definitions.

===P54CQS===
The P54C was followed by the P54CQS in early 1995, which operated at 120 MHz. It was fabricated in a 350 nm BiCMOS process and was the first commercial microprocessor to be fabricated in a 350 nm process. Its transistor count is identical to the P54C and, despite the newer process, it had an identical die area as well. The chip was connected to the package using wire bonding, which only allows connections along the edges of the chip. A smaller chip would have required a redesign of the package, as there is a limit on the length of the wires and the edges of the chip would be further away from the pads on the package. The solution was to keep the chip the same size, retain the existing pad-ring, and only reduce the size of the Pentium&#x27;s logic circuitry to enable it to achieve higher clock frequencies.

===P54CS===
The P54CQS was quickly followed by the P54CS, which operated at 133, 150, 166 and 200 MHz, and introduced Socket 7. It contained 3.3 million transistors, measured 90 mm2 and was fabricated in a 350 nm BiCMOS process with four levels of interconnect.

===P24T===
The P24T Pentium OverDrive for 486 systems were released in 1995, which were based on 3.3 V 600 nm versions using a 63 or 83 MHz clock. Since these used Socket 2/3, some modifications had to be made to compensate for the 32-bit data bus and slower on-board L2 cache of 486 motherboards. They were therefore equipped with a 32 KB L1 cache (double that of pre-P55C Pentium CPUs).

===P55C===
The P55C (or 80503) was developed by Intel&#x27;s Research &amp; Development Center in Haifa, Israel. It was sold as Pentium with MMX Technology (usually just called Pentium MMX); although it was based on the P5 core, it featured a new set of 57 &quot;MMX&quot; instructions intended to improve performance on multimedia tasks, such as encoding and decoding digital media data. The Pentium MMX line was introduced on October 22, 1996, and released in January 1997.

The new instructions worked on new data types: 64-bit packed vectors of either eight 8-bit integers, four 16-bit integers, two 32-bit integers, or one 64-bit integer. So, for example, the PADDUSB (Packed ADD Unsigned Saturated Byte) instruction adds two vectors, each containing eight 8-bit unsigned integers together, elementwise; each addition that would overflow &quot;saturates&quot;, yielding 255, the maximal unsigned value that can be represented in a byte. These rather specialized instructions generally require special coding by the programmer for them to be used.

Other changes to the core include a 6-stage pipeline (vs. 5 on P5) with a return stack (first done on Cyrix 6x86) and better parallelism, an improved instruction decoder, 16KB L1 data cache + 16KB L1 instruction cache with Both 4-way associativity (vs. 8KB L1 Data/instruction with 2-way on P5), 4 write buffers that could now be used by either pipeline (vs. one corresponding to each pipeline on P5) and an improved branch predictor taken from the Pentium Pro, with a 512-entry buffer (vs. 256 on P5).

It contained 4.5 million transistors and had an area of 140 mm2. It was fabricated in a 280 nm CMOS process with the same metal pitches as the previous 350 nm BiCMOS process, so Intel described it as &quot;350 nm&quot; because of its similar transistor density. The process has four levels of interconnect.

While the P55C remained compatible with Socket 7, the voltage requirements for powering the chip differ from the standard Socket 7 specifications. Most motherboards manufactured for Socket 7 before the establishment of the P55C standard are not compliant with the dual voltage rail required for proper operation of this CPU (2.8 volt core voltage, 3.3 volt input/output (I/O) voltage). Intel addressed the issue with OverDrive upgrade kits that featured an interposer with its own voltage regulation.

===Tillamook===
Pentium MMX notebook CPUs used a &quot;mobile module&quot; that held the CPU. This module was a printed circuit board (PCB) with the CPU directly attached to it in a smaller form factor. The module snapped to the notebook motherboard, and typically a heat spreader was installed and made contact with the module. However, with the 250 nm &quot;Tillamook&quot; Mobile Pentium MMX (named after a city in Oregon), the module also held the 430TX chipset along with the system&#x27;s 512 KB static random-access memory (SRAM) cache memory.

==Models and variants==


==Competitors==
After the introduction of the Pentium, competitors such as NexGen, AMD, Cyrix, and Texas Instruments announced Pentium-compatible processors in 1994. &quot;CIO magazine&quot; identified NexGen&#x27;s Nx586 as the first Pentium-compatible CPU, while &quot;PC Magazine&quot; described the Cyrix 6x86 as the first. These were followed by the AMD K5, which was delayed due to design difficulties. AMD later bought NexGen to help design the AMD K6, and Cyrix was bought by National Semiconductor. Later processors from AMD and Intel retain compatibility with the original Pentium.

<text>In quantum mechanics, the Pauli exclusion principle (German: Pauli-Ausschlussprinzip) states that two or more identical particles with half-integer spins (i.e. fermions) cannot simultaneously occupy the same quantum state within a system that obeys the laws of quantum mechanics. This principle was formulated by Austrian physicist Wolfgang Pauli in 1925 for electrons, and later extended to all fermions with his spin–statistics theorem of 1940.

In the case of electrons in atoms, the exclusion principle can be stated as follows: in a poly-electron atom it is impossible for any two electrons to have the same two values of &quot;all&quot; four of their quantum numbers, which are: &quot;n&quot;, the principal quantum number; &#x27;, the [[azimuthal quantum number]]; &quot;m&quot;, the [[magnetic quantum number]]; and &quot;ms&quot;, the [[spin quantum number]]. For example, if two electrons reside in the same [[atomic orbital|orbital]], then their values of &quot;n&quot;,&#x27;, and &quot;m&quot; are equal. In that case, the two values of &quot;m&quot;s (spin) pair must be different. Since the only two possible values for the spin projection &quot;m&quot;s are +1/2 and −1/2, it follows that one electron must have &quot;m&quot;s = +1/2 and one &quot;m&quot;s = −1/2.

Particles with an integer spin (bosons) are not subject to the Pauli exclusion principle. Any number of identical bosons can occupy the same quantum state, such as photons produced by a laser, or atoms found in a Bose–Einstein condensate.

A more rigorous statement is: under the exchange of two identical particles, the total (many-particle) wave function is antisymmetric for fermions and symmetric for bosons. This means that if the space &quot;and&quot; spin coordinates of two identical particles are interchanged, then the total wave function changes sign for fermions, but does not change sign for bosons.

So, if hypothetically two fermions were in the same statefor example, in the same atom in the same orbital with the same spinthen interchanging them would change nothing and the total wave function would be unchanged. However, the only way a total wave function can both change sign (required for fermions), and also remain unchanged is that such a function must be zero everywhere, which means such a state cannot exist. This reasoning does not apply to bosons because the sign does not change.

== Overview ==
The Pauli exclusion principle describes the behavior of all fermions (particles with half-integer spin), while bosons (particles with integer spin) are subject to other principles. Fermions include elementary particles such as quarks, electrons and neutrinos. Additionally, baryons such as protons and neutrons (subatomic particles composed from three quarks) and some atoms (such as helium-3) are fermions, and are therefore described by the Pauli exclusion principle as well. Atoms can have different overall spin, which determines whether they are fermions or bosons: for example, helium-3 has spin 1/2 and is therefore a fermion, whereas helium-4 has spin 0 and is a boson. The Pauli exclusion principle underpins many properties of everyday matter, from its large-scale stability to the chemical behavior of atoms.

Half-integer spin means that the intrinsic angular momentum value of fermions is formula_1 (reduced Planck constant) times a half-integer (1/2, 3/2, 5/2, etc.). In the theory of quantum mechanics, fermions are described by antisymmetric states. In contrast, particles with integer spin (bosons) have symmetric wave functions and may share the same quantum states. Bosons include the photon, the Cooper pairs which are responsible for superconductivity, and the W and Z bosons. Fermions take their name from the Fermi–Dirac statistical distribution, which they obey, and bosons take theirs from the Bose–Einstein distribution.

== History ==

In the early 20th century it became evident that atoms and molecules with even numbers of electrons are more chemically stable than those with odd numbers of electrons. In the 1916 article &quot;The Atom and the Molecule&quot; by Gilbert N. Lewis, for example, the third of his six postulates of chemical behavior states that the atom tends to hold an even number of electrons in any given shell, and especially to hold eight electrons, which he assumed to be typically arranged symmetrically at the eight corners of a cube. In 1919 chemist Irving Langmuir suggested that the periodic table could be explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of electron shells around the nucleus. In 1922, Niels Bohr updated his model of the atom by assuming that certain numbers of electrons (for example 2, 8 and 18) corresponded to stable &quot;closed shells&quot;.

Pauli looked for an explanation for these numbers, which were at first only empirical. At the same time he was trying to explain experimental results of the Zeeman effect in atomic spectroscopy and in ferromagnetism. He found an essential clue in a 1924 paper by Edmund C. Stoner, which pointed out that, for a given value of the principal quantum number (&quot;n&quot;), the number of energy levels of a single electron in the alkali metal spectra in an external magnetic field, where all degenerate energy levels are separated, is equal to the number of electrons in the closed shell of the noble gases for the same value of &quot;n&quot;. This led Pauli to realize that the complicated numbers of electrons in closed shells can be reduced to the simple rule of &quot;one&quot; electron per state if the electron states are defined using four quantum numbers. For this purpose he introduced a new two-valued quantum number, identified by Samuel Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck as electron spin.

== Connection to quantum state symmetry ==

In his Nobel lecture, Pauli clarified the importance of quantum state symmetry to the exclusion principle:
Among the different classes of symmetry, the most important ones (which moreover for two particles are the only ones) are the symmetrical class, in which the wave function does not change its value when the space and spin coordinates of two particles are permuted, and the antisymmetrical class, in which for such a permutation the wave function changes its sign...[The antisymmetrical class is] the correct and general wave mechanical formulation of the exclusion principle.

The Pauli exclusion principle with a single-valued many-particle wavefunction is equivalent to requiring the wavefunction to be antisymmetric with respect to exchange. If formula_2 and formula_3 range over the basis vectors of the Hilbert space describing a one-particle system, then the tensor product produces the basis vectors formula_4 of the Hilbert space describing a system of two such particles. Any two-particle state can be represented as a superposition (i.e. sum) of these basis vectors:
: formula_5
where each is a (complex) scalar coefficient. Antisymmetry under exchange means that . This implies when , which is Pauli exclusion. It is true in any basis since local changes of basis keep antisymmetric matrices antisymmetric.

Conversely, if the diagonal quantities are zero &quot;in every basis&quot;, then the wavefunction component
: formula_6
is necessarily antisymmetric. To prove it, consider the matrix element
: formula_7

This is zero, because the two particles have zero probability to both be in the superposition state formula_8. But this is equal to
: formula_9

The first and last terms are diagonal elements and are zero, and the whole sum is equal to zero. So the wavefunction matrix elements obey:
: formula_10
or
: formula_11

For a system with particles, the multi-particle basis states become &quot;n&quot;-fold tensor products of one-particle basis states, and the coefficients of the wavefunction formula_12 are identified by &quot;n&quot; one-particle states. The condition of antisymmetry states that the coefficients must flip sign whenever any two states are exchanged: formula_13 for any formula_14. The exclusion principle is the consequence that, if formula_15 for any formula_16 then formula_17 This shows that none of the &quot;n&quot; particles may be in the same state.

=== Advanced quantum theory ===
According to the spin–statistics theorem, particles with integer spin occupy symmetric quantum states, and particles with half-integer spin occupy antisymmetric states; furthermore, only integer or half-integer values of spin are allowed by the principles of quantum mechanics.
In relativistic quantum field theory, the Pauli principle follows from applying a rotation operator in imaginary time to particles of half-integer spin.

In one dimension, bosons, as well as fermions, can obey the exclusion principle. A one-dimensional Bose gas with delta-function repulsive interactions of infinite strength is equivalent to a gas of free fermions. The reason for this is that, in one dimension, the exchange of particles requires that they pass through each other; for infinitely strong repulsion this cannot happen. This model is described by a quantum nonlinear Schrödinger equation. In momentum space, the exclusion principle is valid also for finite repulsion in a Bose gas with delta-function interactions, as well as for interacting spins and Hubbard model in one dimension, and for other models solvable by Bethe ansatz. The ground state in models solvable by Bethe ansatz is a Fermi sphere.

== Applications ==
=== Atoms ===
The Pauli exclusion principle helps explain a wide variety of physical phenomena. One particularly important consequence of the principle is the elaborate electron shell structure of atoms and the way atoms share electrons, explaining the variety of chemical elements and their chemical combinations. An electrically neutral atom contains bound electrons equal in number to the protons in the nucleus. Electrons, being fermions, cannot occupy the same quantum state as other electrons, so electrons have to &quot;stack&quot; within an atom, i.e. have different spins while at the same electron orbital as described below.

An example is the neutral helium atom (He), which has two bound electrons, both of which can occupy the lowest-energy (1s) states by acquiring opposite spin; as spin is part of the quantum state of the electron, the two electrons are in different quantum states and do not violate the Pauli principle. However, the spin can take only two different values (eigenvalues). In a lithium atom (Li), with three bound electrons, the third electron cannot reside in a 1s state and must occupy a higher-energy state instead. The lowest available state is 2s, so that the ground state of Li is 1s22s. Similarly, successively larger elements must have shells of successively higher energy. The chemical properties of an element largely depend on the number of electrons in the outermost shell; atoms with different numbers of occupied electron shells but the same number of electrons in the outermost shell have similar properties, which gives rise to the periodic table of the elements.

To test the Pauli exclusion principle for the helium atom, Gordon Drake carried out very precise calculations for hypothetical states of the He atom that violate it, which are called paronic states. Later, K. Deilamian et al. used an atomic beam spectrometer to search for the paronic state 1s2s 1S0 calculated by Drake. The search was unsuccessful and showed that the statistical weight of this paronic state has an upper limit of . (The exclusion principle implies a weight of zero.)

=== Solid state properties ===
In conductors and semiconductors, there are very large numbers of molecular orbitals which effectively form a continuous band structure of energy levels. In strong conductors (metals) electrons are so degenerate that they cannot even contribute much to the thermal capacity of a metal. Many mechanical, electrical, magnetic, optical and chemical properties of solids are the direct consequence of Pauli exclusion.

=== Stability of matter ===

The stability of each electron state in an atom is described by the quantum theory of the atom, which shows that close approach of an electron to the nucleus necessarily increases the electron&#x27;s kinetic energy, an application of the uncertainty principle of Heisenberg. However, stability of large systems with many electrons and many nucleons is a different question, and requires the Pauli exclusion principle.

It has been shown that the Pauli exclusion principle is responsible for the fact that ordinary bulk matter is stable and occupies volume. This suggestion was first made in 1931 by Paul Ehrenfest, who pointed out that the electrons of each atom cannot all fall into the lowest-energy orbital and must occupy successively larger shells. Atoms, therefore, occupy a volume and cannot be squeezed too closely together.

The first rigorous proof was provided in 1967 by Freeman Dyson and Andrew Lenard (de), who considered the balance of attractive (electron–nuclear) and repulsive (electron–electron and nuclear–nuclear) forces and showed that ordinary matter would collapse and occupy a much smaller volume without the Pauli principle.
A much simpler proof was found later by Elliott H. Lieb and Walter Thirring in 1975. They provided a lower bound on the quantum energy in terms of the Thomas-Fermi model, which is stable due to a theorem of Teller. The proof used a lower bound on the kinetic energy which is now called the Lieb–Thirring inequality.

The consequence of the Pauli principle here is that electrons of the same spin are kept apart by a repulsive exchange interaction, which is a short-range effect, acting simultaneously with the long-range electrostatic or Coulombic force. This effect is partly responsible for the everyday observation in the macroscopic world that two solid objects cannot be in the same place at the same time.

=== Astrophysics ===
Dyson and Lenard did not consider the extreme magnetic or gravitational forces that occur in some astronomical objects. In 1995 Elliott Lieb and coworkers showed that the Pauli principle still leads to stability in intense magnetic fields such as in neutron stars, although at a much higher density than in ordinary matter. It is a consequence of general relativity that, in sufficiently intense gravitational fields, matter collapses to form a black hole.

Astronomy provides a spectacular demonstration of the effect of the Pauli principle, in the form of white dwarf and neutron stars. In both bodies, the atomic structure is disrupted by extreme pressure, but the stars are held in hydrostatic equilibrium by &quot;degeneracy pressure&quot;, also known as Fermi pressure. This exotic form of matter is known as degenerate matter. The immense gravitational force of a star&#x27;s mass is normally held in equilibrium by thermal pressure caused by heat produced in thermonuclear fusion in the star&#x27;s core. In white dwarfs, which do not undergo nuclear fusion, an opposing force to gravity is provided by electron degeneracy pressure. In neutron stars, subject to even stronger gravitational forces, electrons have merged with protons to form neutrons. Neutrons are capable of producing an even higher degeneracy pressure, neutron degeneracy pressure, albeit over a shorter range. This can stabilize neutron stars from further collapse, but at a smaller size and higher density than a white dwarf. Neutron stars are the most &quot;rigid&quot; objects known; their Young modulus (or more accurately, bulk modulus) is 20 orders of magnitude larger than that of diamond. However, even this enormous rigidity can be overcome by the gravitational field of a neutron star mass exceeding the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, leading to the formation of a black hole.

<doc id="24670" wikidata="Q203236" url="?curid=24670" title="Pasiphaë">
<text>In Greek mythology, Pasiphaë (; , derived from πᾶσι (dative plural) &quot;for all&quot; and φάος/φῶς &quot;phaos/phos&quot; &quot;light&quot;) was a queen of Crete, and was often referred to as goddess of witchcraft and sorcery. The daughter of Helios and the Oceanid nymph Perse, Pasiphaë is notable as the mother of the Minotaur. Her husband, Minos, failed to sacrifice the Cretan Bull to Poseidon as he had promised. Poseidon then cursed Pasiphaë to fall in love with the bull. Athenian inventor Daedalus built a hollow cow for her to hide in so she could mate with the bull, which resulted in her conceiving the Minotaur.

== Family ==
=== Parentage ===
Pasiphaë was the daughter of god of the Sun, Helios, and the Oceanid nymph Perse. She was thus the sister of Aeëtes, Circe and Perses of Colchis. In some accounts, Pasiphaë&#x27;s mother was identified as the island-nymph Crete herself. Like her doublet Europa, the consort of Zeus, her origins were in the East, in her case at the earliest-known Kartvelian-speaking polity of Colchis (&quot;Egrisi&quot; (), now in western Georgia).

=== Marriage and children ===
Pasiphaë was given in marriage to King Minos of Crete. With Minos, she was the mother of Acacallis, Ariadne, Androgeus, Glaucus, Deucalion, Phaedra, Xenodice, and Catreus.

After having sex with the Cretan Bull, she gave birth to the &quot;star-like&quot; Asterion, who became known as the Minotaur.

== Mythology ==
=== Birth of the Minotaur ===
Minos was required to sacrifice &quot;the fairest bull born in its herd&quot; to Poseidon each year. One year, an extremely beautiful bull was born, Minos refused to sacrifice this bull, and sacrificed another, inferior bull instead. As punishment, Poseidon cursed his wife Pasiphaë to experience lust for the white, splendid bull.

Ultimately, Pasiphaë went to Daedalus and asked him to help her mate with the bull. Daedalus then created a hollow wooden cow covered with real cow-skin, so realistic that it fooled the Cretan Bull. Pasiphaë climbed into the structure, allowing the bull to mate with her. Pasiphaë fell pregnant and gave birth to a half-human half-bull creature that fed solely on human flesh. The child was named Asterius, after the previous king, but was commonly called the Minotaur (&quot;the bull of Minos&quot;).

The myth of Pasiphaë&#x27;s coupling with the bull and the subsequent birth of the Minotaur was the subject of Euripides&#x27;s lost play the &quot;Cretans&quot;, of which few fragments survive. Sections include a chorus of priests presenting themselves and addressing Minos, someone (perhaps a wetnurse) informing Minos of the newborn infant&#x27;s nature (informing Minos and the audience, among others, that Pasiphaë breastfeeds the Minotaur like an infant), and a dialogue between Pasiphaë and Minos where they argue over which between them is responsible. Pasiphaë&#x27;s speech defending herself is preserved, an answer to Minos&#x27; accusations (not preserved) in which she excuses herself on account of acting under the constraint of divine power, and insists that the one to blame is actually Minos, who angered the sea-god.

PASIPHAË:
If I had sold the gifts of Kypris,&lt;br&gt;
given my body in secret to some man,&lt;br&gt;
you would have every right to condemn me&lt;br&gt;
as a whore. But this was no act of the will;&lt;br&gt;
I am suffering from some madness brought on&lt;br&gt;
by a god.&lt;br&gt;
It’s not plausible!&lt;br&gt;
What could I have seen in a bull&lt;br&gt;
to assault my heart with this shameful passion?&lt;br&gt;
Did he look too handsome in his robe?&lt;br&gt;
Did a sea of fire smoulder in his eyes?&lt;br&gt;
Was it the red tint of his hair, his dark beard?
Mythological scholars and authors Ruck and Staples remarked that &quot;the Bull was the old pre-Olympian Poseidon&quot;.

=== Variations on the myth ===
&quot;Pseudo-Apollodorus&quot; mentions a slightly differing reason for why Poseidon cursed Pasiphaë; citing that Minos wanted to be king, and he called upon Poseidon to send him a bull in order to prove to the kingdom that he had received sovereignty from the gods. Upon calling on Poseidon, Minos failed to sacrifice the bull, as Poseidon wished, causing the god to grow angry with him.

According to sixth century BC author Bacchylides, the curse was instead sent by Aphrodite and Hyginus says this was because Pasiphaë had neglected Aphrodite&#x27;s worship for years. In yet another version, Aphrodite cursed Pasiphaë (as well as several of her sisters) with unnatural desires as a revenge against her father Helios, for he had revealed to Aphrodite&#x27;s husband Hephaestus her secret affair with Ares, the god of war, earning Aphrodite&#x27;s eternal hatred for himself and his whole race.

In some more obscure traditions, it was not Poseidon&#x27;s bull but Minos&#x27; father Zeus disguised as one who made love to Pasiphaë and sired the Minotaur. An ancient Greek lexicon mentions a tradition where Zeus and Pasiphaë are the parents of the Egyptian god Amun, who was identified with Zeus.

=== Pasiphaë&#x27;s curse ===
In other aspects, Pasiphaë, like her niece Medea, was a mistress of magical herbal arts in the Greek imagination. The author of &quot;Bibliotheke&quot; records the fidelity charm she placed upon Minos, who would ejaculate serpents, scorpions, and centipedes killing any unlawful concubine; but Procris, with a protective circean herb, lay with Minos with impunity.

In another version, this unexplained disease that tormented Minos killed all his concubines and prevented him and Pasiphaë from having any children (the scorpions and serpents did not otherwise harm Pasiphaë, as she was an immortal child of the Sun). Procris then inserted a goat&#x27;s bladder into a woman, told Minos to ejaculate the scorpions in there, and then sent him to Pasiphaë. The couple was thus able to conceive eight children. Records indicate, this became the first modern documentation of a sheath or condom, though working to promote fertility.
=== Daedalus and Icarus ===
In one version of the story, Pasiphaë supplied Daedalus and his son Icarus with a ship in order to escape Minos and Crete. In another, she helped him hide until he fashioned wings made of wax and bird feathers.

=== Variations about Pasiphaë&#x27;s death ===
While Pasiphaë is an immortal goddess in some texts, other authors treated her as a mortal woman, like Euripides who in his play &quot;Cretans&quot; has Minos sentence her to death (her eventual fate is unclear, as no relevant fragment survives). In Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Aeneas sees her when he visits the Underworld, describing Pasiphae residing in the Mournful Fields, a place inhabited by sinful lovers.

== Personae of Pasiphaë ==
In the general understanding of the Minoan myth, Pasiphaë and Daedalus&#x27; construction of the wooden cow allowed her to satisfy her desire for the Cretan Bull. Through this interpretation she was reduced from a near-divine figure (daughter of the Sun) to a stereotype of grotesque bestiality and the shocking excesses of lust and deceit.

Pasiphaë appeared in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogue VI&quot; (45–60), in Silenus&#x27; list of suitable mythological subjects, on which Virgil lingers in such detail that he gives the sixteen-line episode the weight of a brief inset myth.

In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Ars Amatoria&quot;, Pasiphaë is framed in zoophilic terms:

&quot;Pasiphae fieri gaudebat adultera tauri&quot;—&quot;Pasiphaë took pleasure in becoming an adulteress with a bull.&quot;

Pasiphaë is often included on lists among mythical women ruled by lust; other women include Phaedra, Byblis, Myrrha, Scylla and Semiramis. Scholars see her as a personified sin of bestiality.

&quot;Ars Amatoria&quot; shows Pasiphaë&#x27;s jealousy of the cows; she&#x27;s primping in front of a mirror while she laments that she is not a cow and killing her rivals.
== Cult of Pasiphaë ==
=== On divination ===
In mainland Greece, Pasiphaë was worshipped as an oracular goddess at Thalamae, one of the original &quot;koine&quot; of Sparta. The geographer Pausanias describes the shrine as small, situated near a clear stream, and flanked by bronze statues of Helios and Pasiphaë. His account also equates Pasiphaë with Ino and the lunar goddess Selene.

Cicero writes in &quot;De Divinatione&quot; 1.96 that the Spartan ephors would sleep at the shrine of Pasiphaë, seeking prophetic dreams to aid them in governance. According to Plutarch, Spartan society twice underwent major upheavals sparked by ephors&#x27; dreams at the shrine during the Hellenistic era. In one case, an ephor dreamed that some of his colleagues&#x27; chairs were removed from the agora, and that a voice called out &quot;this is better for Sparta&quot;; inspired by this, King Cleomenes acted to consolidate royal power. Again during the reign of King Agis, several ephors brought the people into revolt with oracles from Pasiphaë&#x27;s shrine promising remission of debts and redistribution of land.

=== Celestial deity ===
In &quot;Description of Greece&quot;, Pausanias equates Pasiphaë with Selene, implying that the figure was worshipped as a lunar deity. However, further studies on Minoan religion indicate that the sun was a female figure, suggesting instead that Pasiphaë was originally a solar goddess, an interpretation consistent with her depiction as Helios&#x27; daughter. Poseidon&#x27;s bull may in turn be vestigial of the lunar bull prevalent in Ancient Mesopotamian religion.

Nowadays, Pasiphaë and her son, the Minotaur, are associated with the astrological sign of Taurus.

== Other representations ==
=== In art ===
The myth of Pasiphaë and the Cretan Bull became widely depicted in art throughout history. Pasiphaë was most often depicted with a bull near her, signifying the connection to the myth.

=== Scientific representation ===
One of Jupiter&#x27;s 79 moons, discovered in 1908, is named after Pasiphaë, the woman of the myth of the Minotaur.

=== Literary representation ===
Pasiphaé is mentioned in Canto 12 of Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot;. When Dante encounters the Minotaur, he describes the unnatural and deceptive manner of the beast&#x27;s conception.

Fiona Benson&#x27;s third collection of poetry, &quot;Ephemeron&quot;, contains a long section entitled &quot;Translations from the Pasiphaë&quot; in which she retells the Minotaur myth from the point of view of the bull-child&#x27;s mother.

== In popular culture ==
* Pasiphaë is a major antagonist in Rick Riordan&#x27;s 2013 fantasy novel &quot;The House of Hades&quot;. In this novel, she is portrayed as an immortal sorceress and former wife of the late King Minos. Having grown bitter towards the gods after the events of the Minoan myth, Pasiphaë allies with the goddess Gaea and her giant army to overthrow the Olympian gods. She is confronted and defeated by Hazel Levesque, a demigod daughter of Pluto, who had been trained in sorcery by the goddess Hecate. In this novel, it is revealed that the Labyrinth is tied to her life force as much as Daedalus&#x27;s, thereby rendering the infamous inventor&#x27;s sacrifice in the previous series useless.
* Pasiphaë appears in Madeline Miller&#x27;s 2018 novel &quot;Circe&quot;, the sister of the book&#x27;s protagonist Circe, the daughter of Helios and Perse. A witch just like her, she and Circe have an antagonistic and sour relationship; after Pasiphaë has intercourse with the Cretan Bull, she calls in Circe to assist her in the Minotaur&#x27;s birth though the two sisters hardly reconcile their differences. It&#x27;s also heavily implied she entered an incestuous affair with her brother Perses, here presented as her twin.
