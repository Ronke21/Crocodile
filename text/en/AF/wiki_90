<text>Sinn Féin ( ; ; ) is an Irish republican and democratic socialist political party active in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.

The original Sinn Féin organisation was founded in 1905 by Arthur Griffith. Its members founded the revolutionary Irish Republic and its parliament, the First Dáil, and many of them were active in the Irish War of Independence, during which the party was associated with the Irish Republican Army (1919–1922). The party split before the Irish Civil War and again in its aftermath, giving rise to the two traditionally dominant parties of Irish politics: Fianna Fáil, and Cumann na nGaedheal (which merged with smaller groups to form Fine Gael). For several decades the remaining Sinn Féin organisation was small and often without parliamentary representation. It continued its association with the Irish Republican Army. Another split in 1970 at the start of the Troubles led to the modern Sinn Féin party, with the other faction eventually becoming the Workers&#x27; Party.

During the Troubles, Sinn Féin was associated with the Provisional Irish Republican Army. For most of that conflict, it was affected by broadcasting bans in the Irish and British media. Although the party sat on local councils, it maintained a policy of abstentionism for the British House of Commons and the Irish Dáil Éireann, standing for election to those legislatures but pledging not to take their seats if elected. After Gerry Adams became party leader in 1983, electoral politics were prioritised increasingly. In 1986, the party dropped its abstentionist policy for the Dáil; some members formed Republican Sinn Féin in protest. In the 1990s, Sinn Féin—under the leadership of Adams and Martin McGuinness—was involved in the Northern Ireland peace process. This led to the Good Friday Agreement and created the Northern Ireland Assembly, and saw Sinn Féin become part of the power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive. In 2006, it co-signed the St Andrews Agreement and agreed to support the Police Service of Northern Ireland.

Sinn Féin is the largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, having won the largest share of first-preference votes and the most seats in the 2022 election, the first time an Irish nationalist party has done so. Since 2024, Michelle O&#x27;Neill has served as the first ever Irish nationalist First Minister of Northern Ireland. From 2007 to 2022, Sinn Féin was the second-largest party in the Assembly, after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), and its nominees served as deputy First Minister in the Northern Ireland Executive.

In the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, Sinn Féin has held seven of Northern Ireland&#x27;s seats since the 2024 election; it continues its policy of abstentionism at Westminster. In Dáil Éireann it is the main opposition, having won the second largest number of seats in the 2024 election. The current president of Sinn Féin is Mary Lou McDonald, who succeeded Gerry Adams in 2018.

==Name==
The phrase &quot;Sinn Féin&quot; is Irish for &quot;Ourselves&quot; or &quot;We Ourselves&quot;, although it is frequently mistranslated as &quot;ourselves alone&quot; (from &quot;Sinn Féin Amháin&quot;, an early-20th-century slogan). The name is an assertion of Irish national sovereignty and self-determination, i.e., the Irish people governing themselves, rather than being part of a political union with Great Britain under the Westminster Parliament.

A split in January 1970, mirroring a split in the IRA, led to the emergence of two groups calling themselves Sinn Féin. One, under the continued leadership of Tomás Mac Giolla, became known as &quot;Sinn Féin (Gardiner Place)&quot;, or &quot;Official Sinn Féin&quot;; the other, led by Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, became known as &quot;Sinn Féin (Kevin Street)&quot;, or &quot;Provisional Sinn Féin&quot;. As the &quot;Officials&quot; dropped all mention of Sinn Féin from their name in 1982—instead calling themselves the Workers&#x27; Party—the term &quot;Provisional Sinn Féin&quot; has fallen out of use, and the party is now known simply as &quot;Sinn Féin&quot;.

Sinn Féin members have been referred to colloquially as &quot;Shinners&quot;, a term intended as a pejorative.

==History==
===1905–1922===
Sinn Féin was founded on 28 November 1905, when, at the first annual Convention of the National Council, Arthur Griffith outlined the Sinn Féin policy, &quot;to establish in Ireland&#x27;s capital a national legislature endowed with the moral authority of the Irish nation&quot;. Its initial political platform was both conservative and monarchist, advocating for an Anglo-Irish dual monarchy unified with the British Crown (inspired by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867). The party contested the 1908 North Leitrim by-election, where it secured 27% of the vote. Thereafter, both support and membership fell. At its 1910 &quot;ard fheis&quot; (party conference) attendance was poor, and there was difficulty finding members willing to take seats on the executive.

In 1914, Sinn Féin members, including Griffith, joined the anti-Redmond Irish Volunteers, which was referred to by Redmondites and others as the &quot;Sinn Féin Volunteers&quot;. Although Griffith himself did not take part in the Easter Rising of 1916, many Sinn Féin members who were members of the Volunteers and the Irish Republican Brotherhood did. Government and newspapers dubbed the Rising &quot;the Sinn Féin Rising&quot;. After the Rising, republicans came together under the banner of Sinn Féin, and at the 1917 &quot;ard fheis&quot; the party committed itself for the first time to the establishment of an Irish Republic. In the 1918 general election, Sinn Féin won 73 of Ireland&#x27;s 105 seats, and in January 1919, its MPs assembled in Dublin and proclaimed themselves Dáil Éireann, the parliament of Ireland. Sinn Féin candidate Constance Markievicz became the first woman elected to the United Kingdom House of Commons. However, in line with Sinn Féin abstentionist policy, she did not take her seat in the House of Commons.

The party supported the Irish Republican Army during the War of Independence, and members of the Dáil government negotiated the Anglo-Irish Treaty with the British government in 1921. In the Dáil debates that followed, the party divided on the Treaty. The pro-Treaty and anti-Treaty components (led by Michael Collins and Éamon de Valera respectively) managed to agree on a &quot;Coalition Panel&quot; of Sinn Féin candidates to stand in the 1922 general election. After the election, anti-Treaty members walked out of the Dáil, and pro- and anti-Treaty members took opposite sides in the ensuing Civil War.

===1923–1970===
Pro-Treaty Dáil deputies and other Treaty supporters formed a new party, Cumann na nGaedheal, on 27 April 1923 at a meeting in Dublin, where delegates agreed on a constitution and political programme. Cumann na nGaedheal went on to govern the new Irish Free State for nine years (it merged with two other organisations to form Fine Gael in 1933). Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin members continued to boycott the Dáil. At a special &quot;Ard Fheis&quot; in March 1926, de Valera proposed that elected members be allowed to take their seats in the Dáil if and when the controversial Oath of Allegiance was removed. When his motion was defeated, de Valera resigned from Sinn Féin; on 16 May 1926, he founded his own party, Fianna Fáil, which was dedicated to republicanising the Free State from within its political structures. He took most Sinn Féin Teachtaí Dála (TDs) with him. De Valera&#x27;s resignation meant also the loss of financial support from America. The rump Sinn Féin party could field no more than fifteen candidates, and won only five seats in the June 1927 general election, a decline in support not seen since before 1916. Vice-president and leader Mary MacSwiney announced that the party simply did not have the funds to contest the second election called that year, declaring &quot;no true Irish citizen can vote for any of the other parties&quot;. Fianna Fáil came to power at the 1932 general election (to begin what would be an unbroken 16-year spell in government) and went on to long dominate politics in the independent Irish state.

An attempt in the 1940s to access funds that had been put in the care of the High Court led to the Sinn Féin Funds case, which the party lost and in which the judge ruled that it was not the legal successor to the Sinn Féin of 1917.

By the late 1940s, two decades removed from the Fianna Fáil split and now the Sinn Féin funds lost, the party was little more than a husk. The emergence of a popular new republican party, led by former IRA members, in Clann na Poblachta, threatened to void any remaining purpose Sinn Féin had left. However, it was around this same time that the IRA leadership once again sought to have a political arm (the IRA and Sinn Féin had effectively no formal ties following the civil war). Following an IRA army convention in 1948, IRA members were instructed to join Sinn Féin en masse and by 1950 they had successfully taken total control of the party, with IRA army council member Paddy McLogan named as the new president of the party. As part of this rapprochement, it was later made clear by the army council that the IRA would dictate to Sinn Féin, and not the other way around.
At the 1955 United Kingdom general election, two Sinn Féin candidates were elected to Westminster, and likewise, four members of Sinn Féin were elected to Leinster House in the 1957 Irish general election. In December 1956, at the beginning of the IRA&#x27;s Border Campaign (Operation Harvest), the Northern Ireland Government banned Sinn Féin under the Special Powers Act; it would remain banned until 1974. By the end of the Border campaign five years later, the party had once again lost all national representation. Through the 1960s, some leading figures in the movement, such as Cathal Goulding, Seán Garland, Billy McMillen, Tomás Mac Giolla, moved steadily to the left, even to Marxism, as a result of their own reading and thinking and contacts with the Irish and international left. This angered more traditional republicans, who wanted to stick to the national question and armed struggle. The Garland Commission was set up in 1967, to investigate the possibility of ending abstentionism. Its report angered the already disaffected traditional republican element within the party, notably Seán Mac Stíofáin and Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, who viewed such a policy as treason against the Irish Republic.

===1970–1975===

Sinn Féin split in two at the beginning of 1970. On 11 January, the proposal to end abstentionism and take seats, if elected, in the Dáil, the Parliament of Northern Ireland and the Parliament of the United Kingdom was put before the members at the party&#x27;s &quot;Ard Fheis&quot;. A similar motion had been adopted at an IRA convention the previous month, leading to the formation of a Provisional Army Council by Mac Stíofáin and other members opposed to the leadership. When the motion was put to the &quot;Ard Fheis&quot;, it failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority. The Executive attempted to circumvent this by introducing a motion in support of IRA policy, at which point the dissenting delegates walked out of the meeting. These members reconvened at Kevin Barry Hall in Parnell Square, where they appointed a Caretaker Executive with Ruairí Ó Brádaigh as chairman. The Caretaker Executive&#x27;s first act was to pass a resolution pledging allegiance to the 32-county Irish Republic and the Provisional Army Council. It also declared itself opposed to the ending of abstentionism, the drift towards &quot;extreme forms of socialism&quot;, the failure of the leadership to defend the nationalist people of Belfast during the 1969 Northern Ireland riots, and the expulsion of traditional republicans by the leadership during the 1960s.

At its October 1970 &quot;Ard Fheis&quot;, delegates were informed that an IRA convention had been held and had regularised its structure, bringing to an end the &quot;provisional&quot; period. By then, however, the label &quot;Provisional&quot; or &quot;Provo&quot; was already being applied to them by the media. The opposing, anti-abstentionist party became known as &quot;Official Sinn Féin&quot;. It changed its name in 1977 to &quot;Sinn Féin—The Workers&#x27; Party&quot;, and in 1982 to &quot;The Workers&#x27; Party&quot;.

Because the &quot;Provisionals&quot; were committed to military rather than political action, Sinn Féin&#x27;s initial membership was largely confined, in Danny Morrison&#x27;s words, to men &quot;over military age or women&quot;. A Sinn Féin organiser of the time in Belfast described the party&#x27;s role as &quot;agitation and publicity&quot; New &quot;cumainn&quot; (branches) were established in Belfast, and a new newspaper, &quot;Republican News&quot;, was published. Sinn Féin took off as a protest movement after the introduction of internment in August 1971, organising marches and pickets. The party launched its platform, &quot;Éire Nua&quot; (&quot;a New Ireland&quot;) at the 1971 &quot;Ard Fheis&quot;. In general, however, the party lacked a distinct political philosophy. In the words of Brian Feeney, &quot;Ó Brádaigh would use Sinn Féin &quot;ard fheiseanna&quot; (party conferences) to announce republican policy, which was, in effect, IRA policy, namely that Britain should leave the North or the &#x27;war&#x27; would continue&quot;.

In May 1974, a few months after the Sunningdale Agreement, the ban on Sinn Féin was lifted by the UK Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin was given a concrete presence in the community when the IRA declared a ceasefire in 1975. &#x27;Incident centres&#x27;, manned by Sinn Féin members, were set up to communicate potential confrontations to the British authorities.

From 1976, there was a broadcasting ban on Sinn Féin representatives in the Republic of Ireland, after the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien, amended Section 31 of the Broadcasting Act. This prevented RTÉ interviewing Sinn Féin spokespersons under any circumstances, even where the subject was not related to the Northern Ireland conflict. This lasted until 1994.

===1976–1983===
Political status for prisoners became an issue after the ending of the truce. Rees released the last of the internees, and ended &#x27;Special Category Status&#x27; for all prisoners convicted after 1 March 1976. This led first to the blanket protest, and then to the dirty protest. Around the same time, Gerry Adams began writing for &quot;Republican News&quot;, calling for Sinn Féin to become more involved politically. Over the next few years, Adams and those aligned with him would extend their influence throughout the republican movement and slowly marginalise Ó Brádaigh, part of a general trend of power in both Sinn Féin and the IRA shifting north. In particular, Ó Brádaigh&#x27;s part in the 1975 IRA ceasefire had damaged his reputation in the eyes of northern republicans.

The prisoners&#x27; protest climaxed with the 1981 hunger strike, during which striker Bobby Sands was elected Member of Parliament for Fermanagh and South Tyrone as an Anti H-Block candidate. After his death on hunger strike, his seat was held, with an increased vote, by his election agent, Owen Carron. Two other Anti H-Block candidates were elected to Dáil Éireann in the general election in the Republic. These successes convinced republicans that they should contest every election. Danny Morrison expressed the mood at the 1981 &quot;Ard Fheis&quot; when he said:

This was the origin of what became known as the Armalite and ballot box strategy. Ó Brádaigh&#x27;s chief policy, a plan for a federalised Irish state dubbed &quot;Éire Nua&quot;, was dropped in 1982, and the following year Ó Brádaigh stepped down as president, and was replaced by Adams.

=== 1983–1998===

Under Adams&#x27; leadership electoral politics became increasingly important. In 1983 Alex Maskey was elected to Belfast City Council, the first Sinn Féin member to sit on that body. Sinn Féin polled over 100,000 votes in the Westminster elections that year, and Adams won the West Belfast seat that had been held by the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). By 1985 it had 59 seats on seventeen of the 26 Northern Ireland councils, including seven on Belfast City Council.

The party began a reappraisal of the policy of abstention from the Dáil. At the 1983 &quot;Ard Fheis&quot; the constitution was amended to remove the ban on the discussion of abstentionism to allow Sinn Féin to run a candidate in the forthcoming European elections. However, in his address, Adams said, &quot;We are an abstentionist party. It is not my intention to advocate change in this situation.&quot; A motion to permit entry into the Dáil was allowed at the 1985 &quot;Ard Fheis&quot;, but did not have the active support of the leadership, and it failed narrowly. By October of the following year an IRA Convention had indicated its support for elected Sinn Féin TDs taking their seats. Thus, when the motion to end abstention was put to the &quot;Ard Fheis&quot; on 1 November 1986, it was clear that there would not be a split in the IRA as there had been in 1970. The motion was passed with a two-thirds majority. Ó Brádaigh and about twenty other delegates walked out, and met in a Dublin hotel with hundreds of supporters to re-organise as Republican Sinn Féin.

In October 1988, the British Conservative government followed the Republic in banning broadcasts of Sinn Féin representatives. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said it would &quot;deny terrorists the oxygen of publicity&quot;. Broadcasters quickly found ways around the ban, mainly by using actors to dub the voices of banned speakers. The legislation did not apply during election campaigns and under certain other circumstances. The ban lasted until 1994.

Tentative negotiations between Sinn Féin and the British government led to more substantive discussions with the SDLP in the 1990s. Multi-party negotiations began in 1994 in Northern Ireland, without Sinn Féin. The Provisional IRA declared a ceasefire in August 1994. Sinn Féin then joined the talks, but the Conservative government under John Major soon came to depend on unionist votes to remain in power. It suspended Sinn Féin from the talks, and began to insist that the IRA decommission all of their weapons before Sinn Féin be re-admitted to the talks; this led to the IRA calling off its ceasefire. The new Labour government of Tony Blair was not reliant on unionist votes and re-admitted Sinn Féin, leading to another, permanent, ceasefire.

The talks led to the Good Friday Agreement of 10 April 1998, which set up an inclusive devolved government in Northern Ireland, and altered the Dublin government&#x27;s constitutional claim to the whole island in Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland. Republicans opposed to the direction taken by Sinn Féin in the peace process formed the 32 County Sovereignty Movement in the late 1990s.

===1998–2017===

At the 1997 Irish general election, Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin was elected to the Dáil. In doing so, he became the first person under the &quot;Sinn Féin&quot; banner to be elected to Leinster House since 1957, and the first since 1922 to take their seat. Ó Caoláin&#x27;s entry to the Dáil marked the beginning of a continuous Sinn Féin presence in the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s national political bodies.

The party expelled Denis Donaldson, a party official, in December 2005, with him stating publicly that he had been in the employ of the British government as an agent since the 1980s. Donaldson told reporters that the British security agencies who employed him were behind the collapse of the Assembly and set up Sinn Féin to take the blame for it, a claim disputed by the British government. Donaldson was found fatally shot in his home in County Donegal on 4 April 2006, and a murder inquiry was launched. In April 2009, the Real IRA released a statement taking responsibility for the killing.

When Sinn Féin and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) became the largest parties, by the terms of the Good Friday Agreement no deal could be made without the support of both parties. They nearly reached a deal in November 2004, but the DUP insisted on photographic or video evidence that decommissioning of IRA weapons had been carried out, which was unacceptable to Sinn Féin.

In April 2006, a number of members of Sinn Féin who believed the party was not committed enough to socialism split from the party and formed a new group called Éirígí, which later became a (minor) political party in its own right.

On 2 September 2006, Martin McGuinness publicly stated that Sinn Féin would refuse to participate in a shadow assembly at Stormont, asserting that his party would only take part in negotiations that were aimed at restoring a power-sharing government. This development followed a decision on the part of members of Sinn Féin to refrain from participating in debates since the Assembly&#x27;s recall the previous May. The relevant parties to these talks were given a deadline of 24 November 2006 to decide upon whether or not they would ultimately form the executive.

The 86-year Sinn Féin boycott of policing in Northern Ireland ended on 28 January 2007, when the &quot;Ard Fheis&quot; voted overwhelmingly to support the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). Sinn Féin members began to sit on Policing Boards and join District Policing Partnerships. There was opposition to this decision within Sinn Féin, and some members left, including elected representatives. The most well-known opponent was former IRA prisoner Gerry McGeough, who stood in the 2007 Assembly election against Sinn Féin in the constituency of Fermanagh and South Tyrone, as an Independent Republican. He polled 1.8% of the vote. Others who opposed this development left to found the Republican Network for Unity.

Sinn Féin supported a no vote in the referendum on the Twenty-eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill 2008.

Immediately after the June 2017 UK general election, where the Conservatives won 49% of seats but not an overall majority, so that non-mainstream parties could have significant influence, Gerry Adams announced for Sinn Féin that their elected MPs would continue the policy of not swearing allegiance to the Queen, as would be required for them to take their seats in the Westminster Parliament.

In 2017 and 2018, there were allegations of bullying within the party, leading to a number of resignations and expulsions of elected members.

At the &quot;Ard Fheis&quot; on 18 November 2017, Gerry Adams announced he would stand down as president of Sinn Féin in 2018, and would not stand for re-election as TD for Louth.

===2018–present===

On 10 February 2018, Mary Lou McDonald was announced as the new president of Sinn Féin at a special Ard Fheis in Dublin. Michelle O&#x27;Neill was also elected as vice president of the party.

Sinn Féin were opposed to Northern Ireland leaving the European Union together with the rest of the United Kingdom, with Martin McGuinness suggesting a referendum on the reunification of Ireland immediately after the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum results were announced, a stance later reiterated by McDonald as a way of resolving the border issues raised by Brexit.

Sinn Féin&#x27;s first elections under McDonald resulted in the party performing well under its own expectations during the 2018 Irish presidential election that October, and similarly, the party&#x27;s performance was labelled &quot;disastrous&quot; during the concurrent May 2019 European Parliament election in Ireland and 2019 Irish local elections. In the European elections, Sinn Féin lost 2 MEPs and dropped their vote share by 7.8%, while in the local elections the party lost 78 (almost half) of their local councillors and dropped their vote share by 5.7%. McDonald stated &quot;It was a really bad day out for us. But sometimes that happens in politics, and it&#x27;s a test for you. I mean it&#x27;s a test for me personally, obviously, as the leader&quot;.

However, in the 2020 Irish general election, Sinn Féin received the greatest number of first preference votes nationally, making it the best result for any incarnation of Sinn Féin since the 1922 election. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party formed a coalition government in June 2020. Although second on seats won at the election, Sinn Féin became the largest party in the Dáil when Marc MacSharry resigned from Fianna Fáil in September 2021, which, with Seán Ó Fearghaíl sitting as Ceann Comhairle, left Sinn Féin the largest party by one seat. Sinn Féin lost their numerical advantage in February 2022 following the resignation of Violet-Anne Wynne.

In November 2020, the national chairman of Sinn Féin Declan Kearney contacted several dissident republican political parties such as Saoradh, Republican Network for Unity and the Irish Republican Socialist Party about creating a united republican campaign to call for a referendum on Irish unification. This information did not become publicly known until 2022 and the move was criticised in some quarters on the basis that it would be wrong for Sinn Féin to work with dissident republican groups which do not repudiate violence by paramilitaries. Sinn Féin retorted that engaging with dissident republicans draws them into the democratic process and political solutions instead of violent ones.

Sinn Féin won 29% of the first-preference votes in the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election, the highest share of any party. With 27 out of 90 seats, they became the largest party in Stormont for the first time ever. &quot;Today ushers in a new era&quot;, O&#x27;Neill said shortly before the final results were announced. &quot;Irrespective of religious, political or social backgrounds, my commitment is to make politics work.&quot;

Following the 2023 Northern Ireland local elections, Sinn Féin became the largest party in local government for the first time. Then, in the local elections in the Republic of Ireland in 2024, Sinn Féin increased their vote share, however, significantly fell short of the polls, showcasing a divide between the party&#x27;s leadership and grassroots over immigration, with disgruntled Sinn Féin voters voting instead for small right-wing parties. However, following the 2024 United Kingdom general election, Sinn Féin became the single largest party representing Northern Ireland in Westminster.

== Past links with Republican paramilitaries ==
Sinn Féin is the largest Irish republican political party, and was historically associated with the Irish Republican Army, while also having been associated with the Provisional Irish Republican Army in the party&#x27;s modern incarnation. The Irish government alleged that senior members of Sinn Féin have held posts on the IRA Army Council. However, the SF leadership has denied these claims.

A republican document of the early 1980s stated: &quot;Both Sinn Féin and the IRA play different but converging roles in the war of national liberation. The Irish Republican Army wages an armed campaign... Sinn Féin maintains the propaganda war and is the public and political voice of the movement&quot;. Robert White states at that time Sinn Féin was the junior partner in the relationship with the IRA, and they were separate organisations despite there being some overlapping membership.

Because of the party&#x27;s links to the Provisional IRA, the U.S. Department of State barred its members along with IRA volunteers from entering the U.S. since the early 1970s in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act on the grounds that they were associated with the IRA waging war against a legitimate government.

The British government stated in 2005 that &quot;we had always said all the way through we believed that Sinn Féin and the IRA were inextricably linked and that had obvious implications at leadership level&quot;.

The Northern Bank robbery of £26.5 million in Belfast in December 2004 further delayed a political deal in Northern Ireland. The IRA were widely blamed for the robbery, although Sinn Féin denied this and stated that party officials had not known of the robbery nor sanctioned it. Because of the timing of the robbery, it is considered that the plans for the robbery must have been laid whilst Sinn Féin was engaged in talks about a possible peace settlement. This undermined confidence among unionists about the sincerity of republicans towards reaching agreement. In the aftermath of the row over the robbery, a further controversy erupted when, on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; programme, the chairman of Sinn Féin, Mitchel McLaughlin, insisted that the IRA&#x27;s controversial killing of a mother of ten young children, Jean McConville, in the early 1970s though &quot;wrong&quot;, was not a crime, as it had taken place in the context of the political conflict. Politicians from the Republic, along with the Irish media, strongly attacked McLaughlin&#x27;s comments.

On 10 February 2005, the government-appointed Independent Monitoring Commission reported that it firmly supported the PSNI and Garda Síochána assessments that the IRA was responsible for the Northern Bank robbery and that certain senior members of Sinn Féin were also senior members of the IRA and would have had knowledge of and given approval to the carrying out of the robbery. Sinn Féin has argued that the IMC is not independent, and that the inclusion of former Alliance Party leader John Alderdice and a British security head was proof of this. The IMC recommended further financial sanctions against Sinn Féin members of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The British government responded by saying it would ask MPs to vote to withdraw the parliamentary allowances of the four Sinn Féin MPs elected in 2001.

Gerry Adams responded to the IMC report by challenging the Irish government to have him arrested for IRA membership—a crime in both jurisdictions—and for conspiracy.

On 20 February 2005, Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform Michael McDowell publicly accused three of the Sinn Féin leadership, Gerry Adams, Martin McGuinness and Martin Ferris (TD for Kerry North) of being on the seven-man IRA Army Council; they later denied this.

On 27 February 2005, a demonstration against the murder of Robert McCartney on 30 January 2005 was held in east Belfast. Alex Maskey, a former Sinn Féin Lord Mayor of Belfast, was told by relatives of McCartney to &quot;hand over the 12&quot; IRA members involved. The McCartney family, although formerly Sinn Féin voters themselves, urged witnesses to the crime to contact the PSNI. Three IRA men were expelled from the organisation, and a man was charged with McCartney&#x27;s murder.

Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern subsequently called Sinn Féin and the IRA &quot;both sides of the same coin&quot;. In February 2005 Dáil Éireann passed a motion condemning the party&#x27;s alleged involvement in illegal activity. The Bush Administration did not invite Sinn Féin or any other Northern Irish political party to the annual St Patrick&#x27;s Day celebrations at the White House, choosing instead to invite the family of Robert McCartney. Senator Ted Kennedy, a regular sponsor of Gerry Adams&#x27; visits to the US during the peace process, also refused to meet Adams and hosted the McCartney family instead.

On 10 March 2005, the House of Commons in London passed without significant opposition a motion, introduced by the British government, to withdraw the allowances of the four Sinn Féin MPs for one year, in response to the Northern Bank Robbery. This measure cost the party approximately £400,000. However, the debate prior to the vote mainly surrounded the more recent events connected with the murder of Robert McCartney. Conservatives and unionists put down amendments to have the Sinn Féin MPs evicted from their offices at the House of Commons but these were defeated.

In March 2005, Mitchell Reiss, the United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland, condemned the party&#x27;s links to the IRA, saying &quot;it is hard to understand how a European country in the year 2005 can have a private army associated with a political party&quot;.

The October 2015 Assessment on Paramilitary Groups in Northern Ireland concluded that the Provisional IRA still existed &quot;in a much reduced form&quot;, and that some IRA members believed its Army Council oversaw both the IRA and Sinn Féin, although it believed that the leadership &quot;remains committed to the peace process and its aim of achieving a united Ireland by political means&quot;.

==Organisation and structure==

Sinn Féin operates under the principle of democratic centralism; the concept that policy should be debated internally within the party, and once a decision is made, all members must support the chosen policy publicly or be disciplined. Once a decision has been made, it cannot be revisited or altered for a prolonged period of time.

Decision-making within Sinn Féin is controlled by two bodies; the national officer board and the Árd Comhairle (national executive). The national officer board consists of 7 members, made up of the President of Sinn Féin, the Vice President, the chairperson, the General Secretary, the Director of Publicity and two treasurers. Policy will be debated amongst the national officer board before next being brought before the Árd Comhairle.

Sinn Féin&#x27;s Árd Comhairle consists of 47 members. Members of the national officer board are automatically members, while the rest of the membership is made up of officers elected at Sinn Féin&#x27;s annual national conference (Ard Fheis). Members of the Árd Comhairle must already be members of the Comhairlí Limistéir (Area councils), which are based county or constituency boundaries. , despite the fact that the bulk majority of Sinn Féin&#x27;s membership and elected representatives come from the Republic of Ireland, the majority of the Árd Comhairle is from Northern Ireland. For every 2 TDs on the Árd Comhairle, there are 3 MLAs. Some members of the Árd Comhairle hold no public office and are former members of the Provisional IRA.

When a decision is made by the Árd Comhairle, all members of Sinn Féin must abide by it without dissent, including the President. In 2020, all of Sinn Féin&#x27;s candidates in the 2020 Irish general election were required to sign a pledge stating &quot;in all matters pertaining to the duties and functions of an elected representative, I will be guided by and hold myself amenable to all directions and instructions issued to me by An Ard Chomhairle of Sinn Féin&quot;.

Within the Árd Comhairle, there is a further subdivision, called the Coiste Seasta (Standing Committee), made up of 8 members, who act as a Central Committee. Unlike other Teachtaí Dála from other parties, Sinn Féin TDs are not allowed to hire their own staff and instead the Coiste Seasta chooses staff for them. Some Sinn Féin TDs have complained of these staff members handing them scripts to read publicly which they had no input into writing.

Some critics inside Sinn Féin have opined that decision-making in the party rests with the officer board and that the Árd Comhairle serves merely to rubberstamp decisions that have already been made. External critics have called Sinn Féin&#x27;s organisation and structure &quot;opaque&quot;, &quot;hierarchial&quot;, &quot;confusing&quot; and &quot;undemocratic&quot;. Former Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín claimed in 2020 that Sinn Féin TDs have &quot;zero influence&quot; over party policy, and that all decisions ultimately rested with the national officer board. It was also in 2020 that both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil criticised Sinn Féin&#x27;s organisation, with Patrick O&#x27;Donovan of Fine Gael stating &quot;the fact that Sinn Féin reps sign a pledge which says they will be guided by their Ard Chomhairle, a council of people not elected by the public, rather than those who elect them, is an outright affront to democracy&quot;. In 2022 the left-wing political magazine &quot;Village&quot; opined that while all major political parties in Ireland are influenced by unelected individuals, Sinn Féin is disproportionally controlled by a &quot;backroom regime&quot;, and alleged that the Coiste Seasta, made up of unelected Northerners and former IRA members, holds the power to influence the decisions of TDs.

Sinn Féin denies the allegations that its structure is undemocratic and has compared its organisation to other Irish political parties such as Fianna Fáil. Sinn Féin maintains it is a bottom-up, not a top-down organisation and that, ultimately, decision-making comes from its annual Ard Fhéis and the votes of ordinary members. In 2020 Mary Lou McDonald dismissed suggestions that Sinn Féin, including herself, were controlled by &quot;shadowy figures&quot; as an idea rooted in sexism. In 2020 she stated &quot;I have a strong sense that there is at least an undertone of sexism and misogyny in suggesting that our strings are pulled. I&#x27;m very stubborn. I&#x27;m very willful. I know my own mind and God help anybody who tries to pull my strings or tell me what to do&quot;. while in 2021 she stated that people needed to get over the &quot;sexist&quot; idea that &quot;this woman couldn&#x27;t possibly be really the leader of Sinn Féin. Well guess what? I really am, boys&quot;.

==Ideology and policies==
Sinn Féin is an Irish republican, democratic socialist and left-wing party. In the European Parliament, the party aligns itself with The Left in the European Parliament - GUE/NGL parliamentary group. Categorised as &quot;populist socialist&quot; in literature, in 2014 leading party strategist and ideologue Eoin Ó Broin described Sinn Féin&#x27;s entire political project as unashamedly populist. The party has been classed as left-wing nationalist and left-wing populist in academia, noting that while Sinn Féin engages in the &quot;us vs them&quot; dynamic of populism, it does so by engaging in the language of &quot;the people vs elites&quot; without resorting to using anti-immigrant rhetoric.

=== Social and cultural ===
Sinn Féin&#x27;s main political goal is a united Ireland. Other key policies from their most recent election manifesto are listed below:

Sinn Féin believes in immigration, both to fill up vacancies in employment, if the system can properly integrate new immigrants and has the resources to do so, and also to &quot;protect people fleeing persecution and war&quot;, but not in &quot;open borders&quot;. The party also believes in faster application processing times for refugees, and in abolishing the direct provision system.

As of January 2022, Sinn Féin in Northern Ireland have committed to:

=== Health ===
At the most recent election in the Republic of Ireland, Sinn Féin committed to:
==== Abortion ====

Until at least 2007, the party was not in favour of the extension of legalised abortion (British 1967 Act) to Northern Ireland; Assembly member John O&#x27;Dowd said that they were &quot;opposed to the attitudes and forces in society, which pressurise women to have abortions, and criminalise those who make this decision&quot;, adding that &quot;in cases of rape, incest or sexual abuse, or where a woman&#x27;s life and health is at risk or in grave danger, we accept that the final decision must rest with the woman.&quot; It voted for the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Act 2013, which allowed for termination in cases where a pregnancy endangered a woman&#x27;s life. It voted to support termination, in those limited circumstances, at the 2015 , but stopped short of supporting abortion on demand. In the 2018 Irish abortion referendum, the party campaigned for a &quot;Yes&quot; vote, while remaining opposed to abortion without restriction up to 12 weeks. At its in June 2018, the month after the &quot;yes&quot; vote in the abortion referendum, the party committed itself to supporting abortion, including without restriction up to 12 weeks. This allowed it not only to support abortion legislation in the Republic, but also to campaign for provision of abortion in Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin TD Peadar Tóibín, who was suspended from the party for voting against abortion legislation, left to form a new party: Aontú.

Sinn Féin have been accused of hypocrisy over their positions on abortion in Northern Ireland. In 2021, Sinn Féin abstained on a Stormont vote on restricting abortion access in the case of fetal abnormalities or disabilities, attracting criticism from both anti-abortion and pro-choice groups, with the Abortion Rights Campaign saying they &quot;let down abortion seekers&quot; and Eamonn McCann accusing them of being &quot;impaled on the fence on the issue&quot;, but with anti-abortion politicians such as Peadar Tóibín accusing them of &quot;speaking out of both sides of their mouth&quot; on the issue. Later in the year, Amnesty International made a public statement calling on the party to &quot;support full abortion rights across the island of Ireland&quot;.

====Transgender health care====

Historically the party has supported access to gender affirming healthcare for transgender individuals. However in 2024 after the UK’s Conservative Party enacted a ban on puberty blockers following the Cass Review, Sinn Féin allowed the ban to be extended to Northern Ireland, closing what some considered a “loophole” regarding access to such treatments in the UK.

=== International relations ===
Sinn Féin has longstanding fraternal ties with the African National Congress and was described by Nelson Mandela as an &quot;old friend and ally in the anti-apartheid struggle&quot;. Sinn Féin supports the independence of Catalonia from Spain, Palestine in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, and the right to self-determination regarding independence of the Basque Country from Spain and France. Sinn Féin opposes the United States embargo against Cuba and has called for a normalization of relations between the two countries. In 2016, the Sinn Féin party president, Gerry Adams was invited by the Cuban government to attend the state funeral of Fidel Castro whom Adams described as a &quot;freedom fighter&quot; and a &quot;friend of Ireland&#x27;s struggle&quot;. Sinn Féin is opposed to NATO membership.

==== European Union ====
Historically, Sinn Féin has been considered to be Eurosceptic. The party campaigned for a &quot;No&quot; vote in the Irish referendum on joining the European Economic Community in 1972. Sinn Féin was on the same side of the debate as the DUP and most of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in that they wanted to pull out when UK had its referendum in 1975. The party was critical of the supposed need for an EU constitution as proposed in 2002, and urged a &quot;No&quot; vote in the 2008 referendum on the Lisbon Treaty, although Mary Lou McDonald said that there was &quot;no contradiction in being pro-Europe, but anti-treaty&quot;. In its manifesto for the 2015 UK general election, Sinn Féin pledged that the party would campaign for the UK to stay within the European Union (EU), with Martin McGuinness saying that an exit &quot;would be absolutely economically disastrous&quot;. Gerry Adams said that, if there were to be a referendum on the question, there ought to be a separate and binding referendum for Northern Ireland. Its policy of a &quot;Europe of Equals&quot;, and its critical engagement after 2001, together with its engagement with the European Parliament, marks a change from the party&#x27;s previous opposition to the EU. The party expresses, on one hand, &quot;support for Europe-wide measures that promote and enhance human rights, equality and the all-Ireland agenda&quot;, and on the other a &quot;principled opposition&quot; to a European superstate. This has led political commentators to define the party as soft Eurosceptic since the 21st century.

Since moving to this &quot;soft Euroscepticism&quot; position, Sinn Féin support a policy of &quot;critical engagement with the EU&quot;, and have a &quot;principled opposition&quot; to a European superstate. It opposes an EU constitution because it would reduce the sovereignty of the member-states. It also critiques the EU on grounds of neoliberalism. Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy says that the &quot;European Union must become a cooperative union of nation states committed to working together on issues such as climate change, migration, trade, and using our common strengths to improve the lives of citizens. If it does not, EU disintegration becomes a real possibility.&quot; The party supported continued UK membership of the European Union in the UK&#x27;s 2016 EU referendum and in April 2022, Mary Lou McDonald said in the Dáil that &quot;We strongly support the Ukrainian people&#x27;s stated desire to join the European Union&quot;.

====Trends====

Sinn Féin returned to Northern Ireland elections at the 1982 Assembly elections, winning five seats with 64,191 votes (10.1%). The party narrowly missed winning additional seats in Belfast North and Fermanagh and South Tyrone. In the 1983 UK general election eight months later, Sinn Féin increased its support, breaking the six-figure vote barrier in Northern Ireland for the first time by polling 102,701 votes (13.4%). Gerry Adams won the Belfast West constituency, and Danny Morrison fell only 78 votes short of victory in Mid Ulster.

The 1984 European elections proved to be a disappointment, with Sinn Féin&#x27;s candidate Danny Morrison polling 91,476 (13.3%) and falling well behind the SDLP candidate John Hume.

By the beginning of 1985, Sinn Féin had won its first representation on local councils, owing to three by-election wins in Omagh (Seamus Kerr, May 1983) and Belfast (Alex Maskey in June 1983 and Sean McKnight in March 1984). Three sitting councillors also defected to Sinn Féin in Dungannon, Fermanagh and Derry (the last defecting from the SDLP). Sinn Féin succeeded in winning 59 seats in the 1985 local government elections, after it had predicted winning only 40 seats. However, the results continued to show a decline from the peak of 1983, as the party won 75,686 votes (11.8%). The party failed to gain any seats in the 1986 by-elections caused by the resignation of unionist MPs in protest at the Anglo-Irish Agreement. While this was partly due to an electoral pact between unionist candidates, the SF vote fell in the four constituencies they contested.

In the 1987 general election, Gerry Adams held his Belfast West seat, but the party failed to make breakthroughs elsewhere and overall polled 83,389 votes (11.4%). The same year saw the party contest the Dáil election in the Republic of Ireland; however, it failed to win any seats and polled less than 2%.

The 1989 local government elections saw a drop in support for Sinn Féin. Defending 58 seats (the 59 won in 1985, plus two 1987 by-election gains in West Belfast, minus three councillors who had defected to Republican Sinn Féin in 1986), the party lost 15 seats. In the aftermath of the election, Mitchell McLaughlin admitted that recent IRA activity had affected the Sinn Féin vote.

In the 1989 European election, Danny Morrison again failed to win a seat, polling at 48,914 votes (9%).

The nadir for SF in this period came in 1992, with Gerry Adams losing his Belfast West seat to the SDLP, and the SF vote falling in the other constituencies that they had contested relative to 1987.

In the 1997 UK general election, Adams regained Belfast West. Martin McGuinness also won a seat in Mid Ulster. In the Irish general election the same year the party won its first seat since 1957, with Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin gaining a seat in the Cavan–Monaghan constituency. In the Irish local elections of 1999 the party increased its number of councillors from 7 to 23.

The party overtook its nationalist rival, the Social Democratic and Labour Party, as the largest nationalist party in the local elections and UK general election of 2001, winning four Westminster seats to the SDLP&#x27;s three. The party continues to subscribe, however, to an abstentionist policy towards the Westminster British parliament, on account of opposing that parliament&#x27;s jurisdiction in Northern Ireland, as well as its oath to the King.
Sinn Féin increased its share of the nationalist vote in the 2003, 2007, and 2011 Assembly elections, with Martin McGuinness, former Minister for Education, taking the post of deputy First Minister in the Northern Ireland power-sharing Executive Committee. The party has three ministers in the Executive.

In the 2010 general election, the party retained its five seats, and for the first time topped the poll at a Westminster election in Northern Ireland, winning 25.5% of the vote. All Sinn Féin MPs increased their share of the vote and with the exception of Fermanagh and South Tyrone, increased their majorities. In Fermanagh and South Tyrone, Unionist parties agreed a joint candidate, this resulted in the closest contest of the election, with Sinn Féin MP Michelle Gildernew holding her seat by 4 votes after 3 recounts and an election petition challenging the result.

Sinn Féin lost some ground in the 2016 Assembly election, dropping one seat to finish with 28, ten behind the DUP. In the snap election eight months later caused by the resignation of McGuinness as deputy First Minister, however, the party surged, winning 27.9% of the popular vote to 28.1% for the DUP, and 27 seats to the DUP&#x27;s 28 in an Assembly reduced by 18 seats. The withdrawal of the DUP party whip from Jim Wells in May 2018 meant that Sinn Féin became the joint-largest party in the Assembly alongside the DUP, with 27 seats each.

===Republic of Ireland===
====Dáil Éireann elections====
The party had five TDs elected in the 2002 Irish general election, an increase of four from the previous election. At the general election in 2007 the party had expectations of substantial gains, with poll predictions that they would gain five to ten seats. However, the party lost one of its seats to Fine Gael. Seán Crowe, who had topped the poll in Dublin South-West fell to fifth place, with his first preference vote reduced from 20.28% to 12.16%.

On 26 November 2010, Pearse Doherty won a seat in the Donegal South-West by-election. It was the party&#x27;s first by-election victory in the Republic of Ireland since 1925. After negotiations with the left-wing Independent TDs Finian McGrath and Maureen O&#x27;Sullivan, a Technical Group was formed in the Dáil to give its members more speaking time.

In the 2011 Irish general election the party made significant gains. All its sitting TDs were returned, with Seán Crowe regaining the seat he had lost in 2007 in Dublin South-West. In addition to winning long-targeted seats such as Dublin Central and Dublin North-West, the party gained unexpected seats in Cork East and Sligo–North Leitrim. It ultimately won 14 seats, the best performance at the time for the party&#x27;s current incarnation. The party went on to win three seats in the Seanad election which followed their success at the general election. In the 2016 election it made further gains, finishing with 23 seats and overtaking the Labour Party as the third-largest party in the Dáil It ran seven candidates in the Seanad election, all of whom were successful.

The party achieved their greatest contemporary result in the 2020 Irish general election, topping the first-preference votes with 24.5% and winning 37 seats. Due to poor results in the 2019 local elections and elections to the European Parliament, the party ran only 42 candidates and did not compete in Cork North-West. The party achieved unexpected success in the early counting, with 27 candidates being elected on the first count. Party leader Mary Lou McDonald called the result a &quot;revolution&quot; and announced she would pursue the formation of a government including Sinn Féin. Ultimately negotiations to form a new government led to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party agreeing to enter a majority coalition government in June. Sinn Féin pledged to be a strong opposition to the new coalition.

====Presidential elections====
====Local government elections====

Sinn Féin is represented on most county and city councils. It made large gains in the local elections of 2004, increasing its number of councillors from 21 to 54, and replacing the Progressive Democrats as the fourth-largest party in local government. At the local elections of June 2009, the party&#x27;s vote fell by 0.95% to 7.34%, with no change in the number of seats. Losses in Dublin and urban areas were balanced by gains in areas such as Limerick, Wicklow, Cork, Tipperary and Kilkenny and the border counties . However, three of Sinn Féin&#x27;s seven representatives on Dublin City Council resigned within six months of the June 2009 elections, one of them defecting to the Labour Party.

===European elections===

In the 2004 European Parliament election, Bairbre de Brún won Sinn Féin&#x27;s first seat in the European Parliament, at the expense of the SDLP. She came in second behind Jim Allister of the DUP. In the 2009 election, de Brún was re-elected with 126,184 first preference votes, the only candidate to reach the quota on the first count. This was the first time since elections began in 1979 that the DUP failed to take the first seat, and was the first occasion Sinn Féin topped a poll in any Northern Ireland election.

Sinn Féin made a breakthrough in the Dublin constituency in 2004. The party&#x27;s candidate, Mary Lou McDonald, was elected on the sixth count as one of four MEPs for Dublin. In the 2009 election, when Dublin&#x27;s representation was reduced to three MEPs, she failed to hold her seat. In the South constituency their candidate, Councillor Toiréasa Ferris, managed to nearly double the number of first preference votes, lying third after the first count, but failed to get enough transfers to win a seat. In the 2014 election, Martina Anderson topped the poll in Northern Ireland, as did Lynn Boylan in Dublin. Liadh Ní Riada was elected in the South constituency, and Matt Carthy in Midlands–North-West. In the 2019 election, Carthy was re-elected, but Boylan and Ní Riada lost their seats. Anderson also held her Northern Ireland seat until early 2020 when her term was cut short by Brexit.

<text>The Willis Tower, originally and still commonly referred to as the Sears Tower, is a 110-story, skyscraper in the Loop community area of Chicago in Illinois, United States. Designed by architect Bruce Graham and engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM), it opened in 1973 as the world&#x27;s tallest building, a title that it held for nearly 25 years. It is the third-tallest building in the Western Hemisphere, as well as the 23rd-tallest in the world. Each year, more than 1.7 million people visit the Skydeck observation deck, the highest in the United States, making it one of Chicago&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations.

The building occupies a site bound by Franklin Street, Jackson Boulevard, Wacker Drive, and Adams Street. Graham and Khan designed the building as nine square &quot;tubes&quot;, clustered in a 3×3 matrix; seven of the tubes set back at upper floors. The tower has 108 stories as counted by standard methods, though the building&#x27;s owners count the main roof as 109 and the mechanical penthouse roof as 110. The facade is made of anodized aluminum and black glass. The base of the building contains a retail complex known as the Catalog. The lower half of the tower was originally occupied by retail company Sears, which had its headquarters there until 1994, while the upper stories were rented out.

The structure was known as the Sears Tower from its construction until the naming rights were included in a 2009 lease with the Willis Group. Local area residents still refer to the building by its old name. , the building&#x27;s largest tenant is United Airlines, which occupies around 20 floors. Other major tenants include the building&#x27;s namesake Willis Towers Watson, and law firms Schiff Hardin and Seyfarth Shaw. Morgan Stanley became the building&#x27;s fourth-largest tenant in 2017.

== History ==

=== Planning ===

==== Site selection ====
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. had occupied an office complex on Chicago&#x27;s west side since 1906. The existing offices were inadequate by 1966, prompting Sears executives to begin searching for a new site. By 1969, Sears was the largest retailer in the world, with about 350,000 employees. Sears executives quickly determined that a new headquarters complex in the suburbs was infeasible, since it would require relocating about 7,000 employees. Instead, Sears executives decided to consolidate the thousands of employees in offices distributed throughout the Chicago area into one building on the western edge of Chicago&#x27;s Loop.

Sears asked its outside counsel, Arnstein, Gluck, Weitzenfeld &amp; Minow (now known as Saul Ewing LLP) to suggest a location. The firm consulted with local and federal authorities and the applicable law, then offered Sears two options. The first option was the Goose Island area northwest of the Loop, but Sears&#x27;s vice president of real estate, Matthew J. Stacom, rejected this proposal. The other was a two-block area in the Loop, bounded by Franklin Street on the east, Jackson Boulevard on the south, Wacker Drive on the west, and Adams Street on the north. Though the site was more centrally located, it was also relatively small, with about . Bernard Feinberg, Albert I. Rubenstein, and Philip Teinowitz had assembled that site over the previous five years, but they had failed to acquire a neighboring lot from bus company Greyhound Lines.

Feinberg, Rubenstein, and Teinowitz then bought options for three adjacent lots. Under the terms of each option, unless the three men were able to acquire at least one of the lots within 90 days, all three options would be forfeited. Ultimately, Sears acquired the Loop site in 1970. Sears then obtained permits to close down one block of Quincy Street, which bisected the site from east to west. Attorneys from the Arnstein firm, headed by Andrew Adsit, began buying the properties parcel by parcel. Sears purchased 15 buildings from 100 owners and paid the government of Chicago $2.7 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the block of Quincy Street that was to be closed down.

==== Design process ====
Sears executives estimated that their new building would need about , split into 70 stories with each or 60 stories with each. Sears commissioned architecture firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM) to design the tower. SOM was also the lead structural engineer, and Jaros, Baum &amp; Bolles provided MEP engineering.

Sears planned to move its merchandise group into the building initially, renting out the remaining space to other tenants until needed. Sears executives were accustomed to large floor areas of at least , but SOM architects raised concerns that the large floors would be unattractive to smaller tenants. A subsequent proposal called for two buildings connected by a footbridge, which would respectively contain and on each floor, but this was also infeasible.

Some floors were designed with smaller footprints to attract prospective lessees, so the building&#x27;s height was increased to meet Sears&#x27;s floor-area requirements. Architect Bruce Graham and structural engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan, both of whom were partners with SOM, proposed a tower with floors in the lower part of the building, as well as a series of setbacks with gradually tapering floor plates, giving the tower its distinctive look. During the design process, one of the architects reportedly pulled out nine cigars and staggered them vertically until the pair both agreed to the arrangement. This allowed Sears to occupy the large lower stories, while providing more conventional office space that could be rented out on the upper stories. The firm of Saphier, Lerner, Schindler was responsible for determining Sears&#x27;s space requirements and designing furniture for the company. It conducted a year-long study to determine how 16 of the company&#x27;s departments should be laid out within the building.

As Sears continued to offer optimistic growth projections, the height of the proposed tower also increased. Under Chicago&#x27;s relatively lax zoning laws, the site could theoretically accommodate a 300-story building with . In practice, most potential tenants did not want excessively high offices. Additionally, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) restricted the height of structures in the area to protect air traffic. FAA officials publicly denied that they had imposed a height limit; however, the area&#x27;s minimum safe altitude would need to be raised by if the building was just taller. Plans for the tower were announced on July 27, 1970. The building would contain 109 stories as measured from Wacker Drive and 110 stories as measured from Franklin Street. This would make Sears&#x27;s new tower the tallest in the world, as measured by roof height, although New York City&#x27;s under-construction World Trade Center Twin Towers would have a taller antenna. Although the Sears Tower would contain of space, only about would be used as offices.

=== Construction ===
==== Early construction ====
Work on the building&#x27;s foundation commenced in August 1970. Contractors excavated the lot to a depth of , and they removed of dirt from the site. By that November, Spencer, White &amp; Prentis Inc. was excavating a trench around the site, measuring deep and across. The contractors then built a slurry wall within the trench, made of concrete and reinforced steel. Workers used steel bracing to prevent the slurry wall from collapsing inward, then used caissons to drill 201 holes into the ground. They also rerouted a sewer that had run underneath Quincy Street, which was to be closed permanently as part of the tower&#x27;s construction.

The Diesel Construction Company was hired as the Sears Tower&#x27;s general contractor. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. chairman Gordon M. Metcalf installed the building&#x27;s first steel beam at a ceremony on June 7, 1971. The project employed 2,000 workers. To accelerate the building&#x27;s construction, a concrete plant was built in the building&#x27;s basement, allowing workers to pour one-third of a concrete floor every day. Contractors built two temporary kitchens on the site for workers, and telephone and loudspeaker systems were installed on every floor to allow workers to communicate. In addition, contractors installed temporary generators that could supply up to simultaneously; during the winter, most of this electricity was used to heat the exposed steel beams on the lowest five floors.

==== Broadcast-signal controversy ====
By late 1971, Chicagoland residents and broadcasters had raised concerns that the new Sears Tower would disrupt television broadcasts. According to one estimate, the building would obstruct television signals for 15 percent of Chicagoans and cause &quot;double images&quot; for another 20 percent, primarily affecting communities to the northwest and southeast. The same year, officials of the village of Skokie, northwest of Chicago, threatened to request an injunction to prevent further construction. In response to these concerns, Sears started researching methods to reduce the tower&#x27;s effect on broadcast signals. &quot;Variety&quot; magazine stated that the Sears Tower did not interfere with broadcasts on its own, since several shorter towers in the Loop also interfered with broadcast signals. Nonetheless, the Illinois Citizens&#x27; Committee for Broadcasting filed a formal complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in February 1972.

The first lawsuit against the building was filed by the state attorney in neighboring Lake County on March 17, 1972. A second suit was filed on March 28 in Cook County Circuit Court by the villages of Skokie, Northbrook, and Deerfield, Illinois. Sears filed motions to dismiss the Lake and Cook County lawsuits, which both sought to cap the building at 67 stories. Sears studied the possibility of erecting antennas atop its tower in April 1972, and the tower&#x27;s construction continued, even as decisions on both lawsuits were delayed. At the end of the month, the company applied for permission to increase the building&#x27;s height limit by and install a new antenna, although eight of Chicago&#x27;s ten television stations criticized the plan. On May 17, 1972, Judge LaVerne Dickson, Chief of the Lake County Circuit Court, dismissed the suit, saying, &quot;I find nothing that gives television viewers the right to reception without interference.&quot; By then, the building had reached the 58th story. The Lake County attorney appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court. In his decision on June 12, Judge Charles R. Barrett contended the plaintiffs did not have a right to undistorted television reception.

Meanwhile, the FCC declined to act on the height dispute on the grounds it did not have jurisdiction. The FAA approved the antennas atop the tower in June 1972, and the Illinois Supreme Court affirmed the previous rulings by Lake and Cook County circuit courts at the end of the month. Work was temporarily paused that July due to a labor strike. The next month, Sears formally announced plans for broadcast antennas on the tower&#x27;s roof, and the company offered to spend $5 million (equivalent to $ in ) to help relocate broadcast stations to the Sears Tower. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the FCC&#x27;s decision in September, and the United States Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of the Seventh Circuit&#x27;s decision that November.

==== Topping-out and completion ====
In November 1972, the Sears Tower became Chicago&#x27;s tallest building, surpassing the Standard Oil Building, which had held the record for one month. At the time, the Sears project employed 1,600 workers in three shifts; one worker had been killed during the project so far. The building&#x27;s final completion had been delayed significantly due to labor strikes and bad weather. The concrete work had reached the 77th floor, while the steel superstructure had reached the 84th floor; the remainder of the steelwork would be difficult to construct because of high winds at higher altitudes. Local television stations WTTW and WLS-TV were planning to install temporary broadcast antennas atop the tower when the steel frame was completed. The tower&#x27;s superstructure had reached the 100th floor in February 1973, at which point it was taller than the Empire State Building in New York City.

The building was topped out on May 3, 1973. The day before the event, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; editorial board wrote: &quot;Move aside, New York. After tomorrow, when schoolchildren dream of big buildings, they&#x27;ll no longer think of you and the Empire State Building and the World Trade Center.&quot; The frame was still not technically complete, as three to four stories remained to be built. One week after the ceremony, four workers died after an elevator shaft caught fire. A fifth worker died after falling from the tower in an unrelated incident four days later. Work was halted again that June due to a labor strike, and Sears began moving furniture into the building that month. The construction cost was about US$150 million, (equivalent to $ in ). Despite the size of the project, Sears executives said the building could not accommodate Sears&#x27; annual shareholder meetings, and the company continued to rent space in other structures.

=== 20th century ===

==== Opening and early years ====
The first Sears employees began moving into the tower during the weekend of September 9, 1973. Flashing beacons on the building&#x27;s roof, the first to be installed at any building in Chicago, were activated the same month. Upon the tower&#x27;s opening, broadcasters at the John Hancock Center, Chicago&#x27;s second-tallest building, had to decide whether to relocate to the Sears Tower. Two television stations decided to relocate. Six other stations remained at the John Hancock Center, citing a study which showed that relocating to the Sears Tower would provide only minimal benefits. Documents released in late 1973 indicated that the Sears Tower would cause much more interference than either Sears or the television stations had disclosed. WLS-TV moved to the Sears Tower in February 1974, followed by WTTW the next month.

By March 1974, three-fourths of the space in the building was occupied; Sears had leased the upper stories to tenants such as Goldman Sachs, Northwest Industries, and Schiff Hardin. A mobile sculpture by Alexander Calder was dedicated in the lobby in October 1974. Sears&#x27; optimistic growth projections were not realized; instead, in late 1974, the company fired 500 workers, about seven percent of the 7,000 Sears employees that worked in the tower. Competition beyond its traditional rivals such as Montgomery Ward arose from emerging retail giants including Kmart, Kohl&#x27;s, and Walmart. As a result of a surplus of office space that emerged in the 1980s, the tower did not draw as many tenants as projected and so stood half-vacant for a decade.

==== Renovation and relocation ====

In February 1984, Sears announced that it would renovate the building to attract visitors to the lower floors. At the time, 6,500 Sears employees occupied more than half of the building, taking up the lowest 48 stories. The remainder of the tower was occupied by 5,500 employees from about 70 companies. As part of the project, the main entrance was covered with a four-story glass dome, and the first four stories were converted into a shopping atrium. In addition, a visitor center for the building&#x27;s Skydeck was constructed. The renovations, designed by SOM, were completed in mid-1985. Paul Gapp of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote that SOM had &quot;scaled the new entrance skillfully, in keeping with the main building&#x27;s height&quot; and that the new atrium &quot;relieves the formerly cramped feeling from just inside the Franklin entrance&quot;.

Sears announced in 1988 that it would sell the tower and relocate its merchandising division from the lower half of the building. The company wanted to earn at least $1 billion from the sale of the Sears Tower, so it offered multiple concessions to potential buyers, including a guarantee that Sears would continue to pay rent on the lower half of the building until tenants were found for these stories. Four large firms were negotiating to buy the tower by July 1989. The company had difficulties finding a buyer, in part because the lower stories were too large for many potential tenants. Sears nearly sold the tower to Canadian company Olympia &amp; York, but the deal was canceled in September 1989 because the two firms could not agree on who would pay the property taxes. In November 1989, Sears decided to instead refinance the building. The next year, Sears took out a mortgage loan on the tower for $850 million from MetLife and AEW Capital Management, with MetLife as the holder of the mortgage note; the loan would mature in 2005.

In 1990, the law firm of Keck, Mahin &amp; Cate decided to move into a development that would become 77 West Wacker Drive, rebuffing Sears&#x27; attempts to entice the firm to stay. Just two years later, Sears began moving its own offices out of the building to a new campus in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, which was completed in 1995. As the maturation of the mortgage approached, Sears renegotiated the loan in 1994. The negotiations resulted in an agreement where Sears would no longer be liable for the $850 million loan, although it would only nominally own the building, while AEW and MetLife effectively had total control. As part of the 1994 agreement, AEW and MetLife would be able to take official ownership of the building in 2003. In 1997, Toronto-based TrizecHahn, at the time the lessee of the CN Tower, acquired AEW&#x27;s holdings in the building for $110 million, assuming $4 million in liabilities and a $734 million mortgage.

=== 21st century ===
Trizec had projected that the Sears Tower would quickly reach a value of $1 billion. These projections were not met, with the tower facing the same vacancy and other problems it saw under Sears, although Trizec made somewhat successful efforts to attract new tenants. Following the September 11 attacks, two of the largest tenants, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, immediately announced plans for vacating 300,000 ft2 of space. In 2003, Trizec sold its holdings of the tower to MetLife for $9 million.

==== Syndicate ownership ====
In March 2004, MetLife announced that it would sell the building to a group of investors, including Joseph Chetrit, Joseph Moinian, Lloyd Goldman, Joseph Cayre, and Jeffrey Feil of New York, as well as American Landmark Properties of Skokie, Illinois. The quoted price was $840 million, with $825 million held in a mortgage. Two years later, in February 2007, the Sears Tower&#x27;s owners obtained a $780 million loan from UBS. At the time, UBS valued the tower at $1.2 billion.

Since 2007, the owners had considered plans for the construction of a hotel on the north side of Jackson Boulevard, between Wacker Drive and Franklin Street, close to the entrance of the observation deck, above the tower&#x27;s underground parking garage. According to the tower&#x27;s owners, the second building was considered in the original design. The plan was eventually cancelled as city zoning did not permit construction of such a tall building in that location. In February 2009, the owners announced they were considering a plan to paint the structure silver, an idea that was later abandoned. It was hoped that a new, silver, paint-job would &quot;rebrand&quot; the building and highlight its advances in energy efficiency for an estimated cost of $50 million.

Although Sears&#x27; naming rights expired in 2003, the building continued to be called the Sears Tower for several years, despite multiple changes in ownership. In March 2009, London-based insurance broker Willis Group Holdings agreed to lease a portion of the building and obtained the naming rights. On July 16, 2009, the building was officially renamed the Willis Tower. By 2011, the building&#x27;s owners were considering selling a partial ownership stake, or even the entire building, to an investor. The next year, United Airlines announced it would move its corporate headquarters from 77 West Wacker Drive to the Willis Tower.

==== Blackstone ownership ====
By March 2015, the Willis Tower was being marketed at a price of $1.5 billion. The same month, the Blackstone Group purchased the tower for a reported $1.3 billion, the highest price ever paid for a property in the U.S. outside of New York City. Blackstone announced a $500 million renovation in January 2017, which would include the construction of the Catalog, a six-story commercial complex, replacing a plaza on Jackson Boulevard and the entrance on Wacker Drive. Architectural firm Gensler designed the renovation. A rooftop terrace was built atop the Catalog, and the building&#x27;s HVAC systems were overhauled. Most of the building&#x27;s elevators, excluding those that served the Skydeck, were also renovated for the first time in the tower&#x27;s history. The new elevators would be faster than the original elevators and would use 35 percent less energy. The building&#x27;s owners installed artwork by Olafur Eliasson, Jacob Hashimoto, and other artists.

To fund these improvements, in February 2017, Blackstone obtained a $1 billion loan from a group of banks including Goldman Sachs. The new loan replaced $750 million of CMBS debt that was maturing. The following year, because of the increasing costs of the renovation, Blackstone received a new $1.3 billion loan from Deutsche Bank and Barclays. The Wacker Drive &quot;Lunchbox&quot; entrance was demolished in early 2018 to make way for the Catalog. A steel globe next to the entrance, manufactured by the Poblocki Sign Company and installed in 2010, was relocated to Elmhurst, Illinois. A private club on the 66th and 67th stories opened in June 2018. The club included a restaurant named Craftsman and a lounge named Frame, both of which exclusively served the tower&#x27;s tenants, as well as a public restaurant known as the East Room. That September, Urbanspace announced that it would operate a food hall on the lower stories.

In 2020, insurance company Aon had proposed acquiring Willis Towers Watson (which had succeeded the Willis Group as the building&#x27;s owner), prompting speculation that the building could be renamed again. The planned merger was canceled in 2021 following an antitrust lawsuit from the United States Department of Justice. The building&#x27;s renovation was completed in May 2022. At the time, although the Willis Tower was nearly 85 percent leased, the number of tenants and visitors entering the building had decreased significantly since 2019, in part because of the COVID-19 pandemic in Chicago. In April 2023, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Blackstone had written down the value of its investment in the tower by $119 million.

===Incidents===
In June 2006, seven men were arrested by the FBI and charged with plotting to destroy the tower. Deputy FBI Director John Pistole described their plot as &quot;more aspirational than operational&quot;. The case went to court in October 2007. After three trials, five of the suspects were convicted and two acquitted. The alleged leader of the group, Narseal Batiste, was sentenced to years in prison. In response to the perceived threat of an attack, the building&#x27;s largest tenant at this time, Ernst &amp; Young, moved to North Wacker Drive in early 2009.

In May 2020, heavy rains caused three of the basement levels to flood, knocking out power to the building. This also resulted in many TV and radio stations going off the air.

== Architecture ==

The Willis Tower was designed by architect Bruce Graham and structural engineer Fazlur Rahman Khan of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill. Graham and Khan designed the building as nine square &quot;tubes&quot;, clustered in a 3×3 matrix forming a square base with sides. The building&#x27;s rentable area is . The structure was intended to accommodate 16,500 employees.

=== Form and facade ===
Each of the &quot;tubes&quot; is a column-free module measuring , which set back at different stories. There are setbacks at the 50th, 66th, and 90th floors. The lowest 50 stories contain nine tubes and cover each. The northwest and southeast tubes terminate at the 50th floor. The 51st through 66th floors each span , above which the northeast and southwest tubes end. From the 67th to 90th floors, each story is shaped like a cross, covering . The north, east, and south tubes end at the 90th floor; the remaining west and center tubes reach 108 floors, with an area of on each of the top stories.

The Sears Tower was the first building to use this innovative design. It was both structurally efficient and economic: at 1,450 feet, it provided more space and rose higher than the Empire State Building and cost much less per unit area. The system would prove highly influential in skyscraper construction and has been used in most supertall buildings since, including the world&#x27;s current tallest building, the Burj Khalifa. In February 1982, two television antennas were added to the structure, increasing its total height to . The western antenna was later extended, bringing the overall height to on June 5, 2000, to improve reception of local NBC station WMAQ-TV.

The perimeter of the Willis Tower contains columns that are spaced apart on their centers. The facade is made of anodized aluminum and black glass. Alcoa manufactured of aluminum sheeting for the building&#x27;s facade. Black bands appear on the tower around the 29th–32nd, 64th–65th, 88th–89th, and 104th–108th floors. These elements are louvers to ventilate the building&#x27;s environmental support systems and obscure its belted trusses. The rest of the facade is made of 16,000 rectangular windows. all of which measure and are tinted with bronze.

Outside the building, there was originally a plaza made of pink granite. In the late 2010s, a three-level wing was built along the western and southern sides of the tower replacing the plaza. The roof garden above the annex spans . The annex contains a facade of black steel and aluminum, similar to in the original building. The Jackson Boulevard facade of the annex contains an artwork by Olafur Eliasson, entitled &quot;Atmospheric wave wall&quot;. The work, measuring across, comprises almost 2,000 blue-and-green steel tiles, which are decorated with hexagonal motifs. The wall is backlit at night.

=== Structural and mechanical features ===
The interior includes of steel, of aluminum, and of concrete flooring. The building contains diagonal columns only on the two stories immediately below each of the setbacks, thus reducing shear stress. The interior of the building could not contain diagonal beams, since these would have obstructed the connections between each of the &quot;tubes&quot;. Therefore, the columns and the horizontal beams on each story are connected by rigid joints. The superstructure was designed to withstand wind gusts of , which on average would occur once every hundred years. According to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the top of the building would be able to bend by as much as , returning to its normal position within 7.2 seconds.

The Willis Tower&#x27;s basement extends deep, resting on a concrete slab. The ground directly beneath the building was largely made of clay; the underlying layer of limestone was as much as beneath ground level. As a result, the foundation was excavated using 201 caissons, of which 114 reached the underlying limestone. The caissons created holes that measured up to across. Some holes at the northwestern and northeastern corners of the site filled up with groundwater and had to be drained. Workers next placed steel tubes into the holes, then poured concrete around the tubes.

During the Sears Tower&#x27;s construction, SOM and Chicago government officials considered adding &quot;smoke free and fire free&quot; areas to the building, as well as a complete sprinkler system serving all floors. Neither of these features had previously been used in a structure in Chicago. Even though regulations did not require a fire sprinkler system, the building was equipped with one from the beginning. There are around 40,000 sprinkler heads in the building, installed at a cost of $4 million. When it was completed, the Sears Tower was heated electrically, unlike older structures that used gas heating. It included 145,000 light fixtures and a cooling system capable of 17,000 tons of refrigeration. Furthermore, the tower contained fire-suppression and communications systems for emergency use, which were powered by diesel generators. If there was a fire in one section of the building, the building&#x27;s smoke-detection system would close off the fresh-air intake openings in that section, discharging smoke outdoors.

Fifteen above-ground stories, as well as three of the basement levels, contain mechanical equipment. Above the Skydeck on the 103rd floor is a seven-story mechanical penthouse.

==== Elevators and escalators ====
The Sears Tower was planned with 103 elevators, including 14 double-deck elevators. The office stories are served by 97 elevator cabs; due to the presence of the double-deck elevators, these occupy 83 shafts. As designed, one bank of single-deck elevators connected the lobby to the lowest 28 stories. Banks of double-deck elevators traveled to &quot;sky lobbies&quot; at the 33rd/34th and 66th/67th floors, where passengers could transfer to local elevators. The 34th through 103rd stories were served by local elevators that operated from the sky lobbies. Two elevators also ran directly from the lobby to the Skydeck on the 103rd floor. , the elevators carried 5.8 million passengers per year.

Six of the elevators are used for freight. One of the freight elevators served all stories, traveling to a height of . During a fire or another emergency, this elevator would be reserved for the Chicago Fire Department. Other elevators would be controlled from the 33rd floor. During a fire, elevators would be dispatched to the affected floors to assist with evacuation.

The building also had 16 escalators, including a set of double-height escalators that traveled from the main lobby to the lower mezzanine. Another set of escalators connects the 33rd and 34th stories.

=== Interior ===

==== Base ====

When the building was completed, the main entrance was on Wacker Drive to the west. There was a plaza on the south side of the building, sloping upward toward Franklin Street to the east. The Franklin Street side of the building was lower than the Wacker Drive entrance, so the entrances on Franklin Street were actually below the plaza, leading to the building&#x27;s lower mezzanine. Below ground level are three basement levels with a total area of . The basements included a 1,200-seat cafeteria, commercial space, service areas, and a loading dock for 17 trucks. The basement also contained a 150-spot parking garage.

, the building&#x27;s base covers and contains two lobbies for tenants. The building&#x27;s tenants primarily enter from Wacker Drive and Franklin Street. Shoppers, restaurant patrons, and visitors to the Skydeck observation deck use the southern entrance on Jackson Boulevard. The Wacker Drive lobby contains &quot;In the Heart of this Infinite Particle of Galactic Dust&quot;, a 2019 artwork by Jacob Hashimoto. It consists of over 7,000 rice-paper and resin disks that are hung from the ceiling. To honor Khan&#x27;s contributions to skyscraper engineering design, the Structural Engineers Association of Illinois also commissioned a sculpture of him for the lobby of the Willis Tower.

The commercial complex at the building&#x27;s lowest stories is known as the Catalog, a reference to Sears&#x27; mail-order catalogs. The six-story complex includes numerous restaurants. It extends into three of the building&#x27;s basement levels, as well as the three-story annex to the south and west of the tower. The roof of the annex includes a curved skylight with 240 glass panes, and the northern section of the annex&#x27;s roof is supported by black columns that resemble those in the original tower. The Catalog also contains decorative details, such as handrails and staircase landings, which are inspired by elements of Chicago&#x27;s &quot;built environment&quot;. The third story of the Catalog contains a 30,000-square-foot coworking space operated by Convene.

=== Skydeck ===

The Willis Tower observation deck, called the Skydeck, opened on June 22, 1974. Located on the 103rd floor, above ground level, it is the highest observation deck in the United States and one of Chicago&#x27;s most famous tourist attractions. Tourists can experience how the building sways in wind and see far over the plains of Illinois and across Lake Michigan to Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin in clear conditions. Elevators reach the top in about 60 seconds, allowing occupants to feel the change in pressure as they ascend. Some 1.7 million tourists visit annually . There is also an event venue on the 99th floor.

In January 2009, a major renovation of the Skydeck began, including the installation of retractable glass balconies which extend approximately from the facade of the 103rd floor, overlooking South Wacker Drive. The all-glass boxes, informally dubbed &quot;The Ledge&quot;, allow visitors to see the street below. The boxes, which can accommodate , opened to the public on July 2, 2009. On May 29, 2014, the laminated glass flooring of one of the boxes cracked while visitors were inside, but there were no injuries. The flooring of the same box cracked again on June 12, 2019. In May 2022 a fifth glass ledge opened on the west facade overlooking South Wacker Drive.

== Height ==
When completed, the Sears Tower was the world&#x27;s tallest building but not the world&#x27;s tallest structure. Toronto&#x27;s CN Tower was about taller, although the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) does not consider the CN Tower to be a building, since it does not have floors from the ground up. The Willis Tower remains the third tallest building in the Americas and in the Western Hemisphere (after One World Trade Center and Central Park Tower in New York City). With a pinnacle height of , it is the third-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas. It is the 16th-tallest freestanding structure in the world by pinnacle height.

When the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, was completed in 1998, it claimed to be the tallest building in the world, measuring tall including decorative spires. Chicagoans objected to this claim on the basis that the Sears Tower&#x27;s top floor was higher than that of either of the Petronas Towers. In the ensuing controversy, four categories of &quot;tallest building&quot; were created. Of these, Petronas was the tallest in the category of height to the top of architectural elements, meaning spires but not antennas. Taipei 101 in Taiwan claimed the record in three of the four categories in 2004, surpassing the Petronas Twin Towers in spire height and the Sears Tower in roof height and highest occupied floor. People suggested that Sears add cosmetics atop its tower to surpass Taipei 101, but this did not materialize. On August 12, 2007, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai was reported by its developers to have surpassed the tower in all height categories. Upon completion, One World Trade Center in New York City surpassed the Willis Tower through its structural and pinnacle heights, but not by roof, observation deck elevation, or highest occupied floor.

Until 2000, the tower did not hold the record for being the tallest building by pinnacle height. From 1969 to 1978, this record was held by John Hancock Center, whose antenna reached a height of , taller than the Sears Tower&#x27;s original height. One World Trade Center became taller by pinnacle height with the addition of a 359-foot (109.4-meter) antenna, bringing its total height to . In 1982, two antennas were installed which brought its total height to , making it taller than the John Hancock Center but not One World Trade Center. However, the extension of the tower&#x27;s western antenna in June 2000 to allowed it to just barely claim the title of tallest building by pinnacle height.

The lowest level of the Willis Tower is below the elevation of Franklin Street.

=== Climbing ===

On May 25, 1981, Dan Goodwin, wearing a homemade Spider-Man suit while using suction cups, camming devices, and sky hooks, and despite several attempts by the Chicago Fire Department to stop him, made the first successful outside ascent of the tower. Goodwin was arrested at the top after the seven-hour climb and was later charged with trespassing. Goodwin stated that the reason he made the climb was to call attention to shortcomings in high-rise rescue and firefighting techniques. After a lengthy interrogation by Chicago&#x27;s District Attorney and Fire Commissioner, Goodwin was officially released from jail.

In August 1999, French urban climber Alain &quot;Spiderman&quot; Robert, using only his bare hands and bare feet, scaled the building&#x27;s exterior glass and steel wall all the way to the top. A thick fog settled in near the end of his climb, making the last 20 stories of the building&#x27;s glass and steel exterior slippery.

Annually, since 2009, the Willis Tower has hosted SkyRise Chicago, the world&#x27;s tallest indoor stair climb, as a charity event benefiting Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, where participants can (legally) climb the Willis Tower&#x27;s 103-story staircase.

== Naming rights ==

Sears sold the tower in 1994 and vacated it by 1995, but retained naming rights through 2003. The new owners were rebuffed in renaming deals with CDW Corp in 2005 and the U.S. Olympic Committee in 2008. British insurance broker Willis Group Holdings leased more than of space on three floors in 2009. A Willis spokesman said the naming rights were obtained as part of the negotiations at no cost to Willis and the building was renamed the Willis Tower on July 16, 2009.

The naming rights are valid for 15 years, so it is possible that the building&#x27;s name could change again as soon as 2024. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; joked that the building&#x27;s new name reminded them of the oft-repeated &quot;What you talkin&#x27; &#x27;bout, Willis?&quot; catchphrase from the American television sitcom &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and considered the name-change ill-advised in &quot;a city with a deep appreciation of tradition and a healthy ego, where some Chicagoans still mourn the switch from Marshall Field&#x27;s to Macy&#x27;s&quot;. This feeling was confirmed in a July 16, 2009, CNN article in which some Chicago-area residents expressed reluctance to accept the Willis Tower name, and in an article that appeared in the October 2010 issue of &quot;Chicago&quot; magazine that ranked the building among Chicago&#x27;s 40 most important, the author pointedly refused to acknowledge the name change and referred to the building as the &quot;Sears Tower&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called the name change one of the top 10 worst corporate name changes and pointed to negative press coverage by local news outlets and online petitions from angry residents. The naming rights issue continued into 2013, when Eric Zorn noted in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that &quot;We&#x27;re stubborn about such things. This month marked four years since the former Sears Tower was re-christened Willis Tower, and the new name has yet to stick.&quot;

== Broadcasting ==

Many broadcast station transmitters are located at the top of the Willis Tower. Each list is ranked by height from the top down. Stations at the same height on the same mast indicate the use of a diplexer into the same shared antenna. Due to its extreme height, FM stations (all class B) are very limited in power output.

=== Radio stations ===

NOAA Weather Radio station KWO39 transmits off the tower at 162.550 MHz. Programmed by the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Chicago, it is equipped with Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME), which sets off a siren on specially programmed weather radios to alert of an impending hazard.

=== Television stations ===
== Cultural depictions ==
The building has appeared in numerous films and television shows set in Chicago such as &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, where Ferris and company visit the observation deck. &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; introduced a character called The Sears Tower Dressed In Sears Clothing when the show visited Chicago in 2006. The building is also featured in History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Life After People&quot;, in which it and other human-made landmarks suffer from neglect without humans around, collapsing two hundred years after people are gone.

In the 2008 film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;, it is part of Gotham City. In the 2011 film &quot;&quot;, it is featured in a number of scenes. In the 2013 film &quot;Man of Steel&quot;, the tower is the location of the offices of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;.

<text>Simony () is the act of selling church offices and roles or sacred things. It is named after Simon Magus, who is described in the Acts of the Apostles as having offered two disciples of Jesus payment in exchange for their empowering him to impart the power of the Holy Spirit to anyone on whom he would place his hands. The term extends to other forms of trafficking for money in &quot;spiritual things&quot;.

==Origin==
The earliest church legislation against simony may be that of the forty-eighth canon of the Synod of Elvira (), against the practice of making a donation following a baptism.

Following the Edict of Milan (313), the increased power and wealth of the church hierarchy attracted simony. There are several accusations of simony (not by that name) against Arians, from Athanasius of Alexandria, Hilary of Poitiers, Pope Liberius and Gregory of Nazianzus. Many Church Fathers, such as Ambrose, spoke out against the selling of ministries.

Anti-simony provisions in Church Council canons (and papal bulls) became common: the First Council of Nicaea, the Synod of Antioch (341), and the Councils of Serdica (343–344), Chalcedon, and Orléans (533), etc.

The purchase or sale of ecclesiastical office was associated with the figure of Simon Magus in the Acts of the Apostles and his name came into use as a term. Important in popularizing the word &#x27;Simony&#x27; was Pope Gregory I (590–604), who called such exchanges the &quot;simoniac heresy&quot;.

==In the Middle Ages==
Although considered a serious offense against canon law, simony is thought to have become widespread in the Catholic Church during the 9th and 10th centuries. In the eleventh century, it was the focus of a great deal of debate. Central to this debate was the validity of simoniacal orders: that is, whether a cleric who had obtained their office through simony was validly ordained.

The , the and the Decretals of Gregory IX all dealt with the subject. The offender, whether (the perpetrator of a simoniacal transaction) or (the beneficiary of a simoniacal transaction), was liable to deprivation of his benefice and deposition from orders if a secular priest, or to confinement in a stricter monastery if a regular. No distinction seems to have been drawn between the sale of an immediate and of a reversionary interest. The innocent was, apart from dispensation, liable to the same penalties as though he were guilty.

In 1494, a member of the Carmelite order, Adam of Genoa, was found murdered in his bed with twenty wounds after preaching against the practice of simony.

===In literature===
In the 14th century, Dante Alighieri depicted the punishment of many &quot;clergymen, and popes and cardinals&quot; in hell for being avaricious or miserly.

He also criticised certain popes and other simoniacs:

==In the Catholic Church==
Simony remains prohibited in Roman Catholic canon law. In the Code of Canon Law, Canon 149.3 notes that &quot;Provision of an office made as a result of simony is invalid by the law itself.&quot;

==Church of England==
The Church of England struggled with the practice after its separation from Rome. For the purposes of English law, simony is defined by William Blackstone as &quot;obtain[ing] orders, or a licence to preach, by money or corrupt practices&quot; or, more narrowly, &quot;the corrupt presentation of any one to an ecclesiastical benefice for gift or reward&quot;. While English law recognized simony as an offence, it treated it as merely an ecclesiastical matter, rather than a crime, for which the punishment was forfeiture of the office or any advantage from the offence and severance of any patronage relationship with the person who bestowed the office. Both Edward VI and Elizabeth I promulgated statutes against simony, in the latter case through the Simony Act 1588 (31 Eliz. 1. c. 6) and Simony Act 1688. The cases of Bishop of St. David&#x27;s Thomas Watson in 1699 and of Dean of York William Cockburn in 1841 were particularly notable.

By the Benefices Act 1892, a person guilty of simony is guilty of an offence for which he may be proceeded against under the Clergy Discipline Act 1892 (55 &amp; 56 Vict. c. 32). An innocent clerk is under no disability, as he might be by the canon law. Simony may be committed in three ways – in promotion to orders, in presentation to a benefice, and in resignation of a benefice. The common law (with which the canon law is incorporated, as far as it is not contrary to the common or statute law or the prerogative of the Crown) has been considerably modified by statute. Where no statute applies to the case, the doctrines of the canon law may still be of authority.

, simony remains an offence. An unlawfully bestowed office can be declared void by the Crown, and the offender can be disabled from making future appointments and fined up to £1,000. Clergy are no longer required to make a declaration as to simony on ordination, but offences are now likely to be dealt with under the Clergy Discipline Measure 2003 (No. 3).

<text>The Samaritans (; ; ; ), often preferring to be called Israelite Samaritans, are an ethnoreligious group originating from the Hebrews and Israelites of the ancient Near East. They are indigenous to Samaria, a historical region of ancient Israel and Judah that comprises the northern half of what is today referred to as the West Bank. They are adherents of Samaritanism, an Abrahamic, monotheistic, and ethnic religion that developed alongside Judaism.

According to their tradition, the Samaritans are descended from the Israelites who, unlike the Ten Lost Tribes of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, were not subject to the Assyrian captivity after the northern Kingdom of Israel was destroyed and annexed by the Neo-Assyrian Empire around 720 BCE. Regarding the Samaritan Pentateuch as the unaltered Torah, the Samaritans view the Jews as close relatives but claim that Judaism fundamentally alters the original Israelite religion. The most notable theological divide between Jewish and Samaritan doctrine concerns the world&#x27;s holiest site, which the Jews believe is the Temple Mount in Jerusalem and which Samaritans believe is Mount Gerizim near modern Nablus and ancient Shechem. Both Jews and Samaritans assert that the Binding of Isaac occurred at their respective holy sites, identifying them as Moriah. The Samaritans attribute their schism with the Jews to Eli, who was a High Priest of Israel around the 11th century BCE; in accordance with Samaritan beliefs, he is accused of establishing a religious shrine in Shiloh in opposition to the establishment of the original shrine on Mount Gerizim.

Once a large community, the Samaritan population shrank significantly in the wake of the Samaritan revolts, which were brutally suppressed by the Byzantine Empire in the 6th century. Their numbers were further reduced by Christianization under the Byzantines and later by Islamization following the Arab conquest of the Levant. In the 12th century, the Jewish explorer and writer Benjamin of Tudela estimated that only around 1,900 Samaritans remained in Palestine and Syria.

 the Samaritan community numbers around 900 people, split between Israel (some 460 in Holon) and the West Bank (some 380 in Kiryat Luza). The Samaritans in Kiryat Luza speak Levantine Arabic, while those in Holon primarily speak Israeli Hebrew. For liturgy they also use Samaritan Hebrew and Samaritan Aramaic, both of which are written in the Samaritan script. According to Samaritan tradition, the position of the community&#x27;s leading Samaritan High Priest has continued without interruption over the course of the last 3,600 years, beginning with the Hebrew prophet Aaron. Since 2013, the 133rd Samaritan High Priest has been Aabed-El ben Asher ben Matzliach.

In censuses, Israeli law classifies the Samaritans as a distinct religious community, but the Chief Rabbinate of Israel classifies them as ethnic Jews (i.e., Israelites). However, Rabbinic literature rejected the Samaritans&#x27; Halakhic Jewishness because they refused to renounce their belief that Mount Gerizim was the historical holy site of the Israelites. All Samaritans in both Holon and Kiryat Luza are Israeli citizens, but those in Kiryat Luza also hold Palestinian citizenship.

Around the world, there are significant and growing numbers of communities, families, and individuals who, despite the fact that they are not part of the Samaritan community, identify with and observe the tenets and traditions of the Samaritans&#x27; ethnic religion. The largest community outside the Levant, the &quot;Shomrey HaTorah&quot; of Brazil (generally known as neo-Samaritans worldwide), has approximately 3,000 members .

== Etymology and terminology ==
Inscriptions from the Samaritan diaspora in Delos, dating as early as 150–50 BCE, provide the &quot;oldest known self-designation&quot; for Samaritans, indicating that they called themselves &quot;Bene Israel&quot; in Hebrew (English: &quot;Children of Israel&quot;, i.e. literally the descendants of the biblical prophet Israel, also known as Jacob, more commonly &quot;Israelites&quot;).

In their own language, Samaritan Hebrew, the Samaritans call themselves &quot;Israel&quot;, &quot;B&#x27;nai Israel&quot;, and, alternatively, &quot;Shamerim&quot; (שַמֶרִים), meaning &quot;Guardians/Keepers/Watchers&quot;, and in Arabic &quot;al-Sāmiriyyūn&quot; (). The term is cognate with the Biblical Hebrew term &quot;Šomerim&quot;, and both terms reflect a Semitic root שמר, which means &quot;to watch, guard&quot;.
Historically, Samaritans were concentrated in Samaria. In Modern Hebrew, the Samaritans are called &quot;Shomronim&quot; (שומרונים), which means &quot;inhabitants of Samaria&quot;, literally, &quot;Samaritans&quot;. In modern English, Samaritans refer to themselves as Israelite Samaritans.

That the meaning of their name signifies &quot;Guardians/Keepers/Watchers [of the Law/Samaritan Pentateuch]&quot;, rather than being a toponym referring to the inhabitants of the region of Samaria, was remarked on by a number of Christian Church Fathers, including Epiphanius of Salamis in the &quot;Panarion&quot;, Jerome and Eusebius in the &quot;Chronicon,&quot; and Origen in &quot;The Commentary on Saint John&#x27;s Gospel.&quot; The historian Josephus uses several terms for the Samaritans, which he appears to use interchangeably. Among them is a reference to &quot;Khuthaioi&quot;, a designation employed to denote peoples in Media and Persia putatively sent to Samaria to replace the exiled Israelite population. These Khouthaioi were in fact Hellenistic Phoenicians/Sidonians. &quot;Samareis&quot; (Σαμαρεῖς) may refer to inhabitants of the region of Samaria, or of the city of that name, though some texts use it to refer specifically to Samaritans.

== Origins ==
The origins of the Samaritans have long been disputed between their own tradition and that of the Jews. Ancestrally, Samaritans affirm that they descend from the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh in ancient Samaria. Samaritan tradition associates the split between them and the Judean-led southern Israelites to the time of the biblical priest Eli, described as a &quot;false&quot; high priest who usurped the priestly office from its occupant, Uzzi, and established a rival shrine at Shiloh, thereby preventing southern pilgrims from Judah and the territory of Benjamin from attending the shrine at Gerizim. Eli is also held to have created a duplicate of the Ark of the Covenant, which eventually made its way to the Judahite sanctuary in Jerusalem.

In contrast, Jewish Orthodox tradition—based on material in the Bible, Josephus and the Talmud—dates their presence much later, to the beginning of the Babylonian captivity. In Rabbinic Judaism, for example in the Tosefta Berakhot, the Samaritans are called &quot;Cuthites&quot; or Cutheans (, &quot;Kutim&quot;), referring to the ancient city of Kutha, geographically located in what is today Iraq. Josephus in both the &quot;Wars of the Jews&quot; and the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot;, in writing of the destruction of the temple on Mt. Gerizim by John Hyrcanus, also refers to the Samaritans as the Cuthaeans. In the biblical account, however, Kuthah was one of several cities from which people were brought to Samaria.

The similarities between Samaritans and Jews were such that the rabbis of the Mishnah found it impossible to draw a clear distinction between the two groups. Attempts to date when the schism among Israelites took place—which engendered the division between Samaritans and Judaeans—vary greatly, from the time of Ezra down to the siege of Jerusalem (70 CE) and the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE). The emergence of a distinctive Samaritan identity, the outcome of a mutual estrangement between them and Jews, was something that developed over several centuries. Generally, a decisive rupture is believed to have taken place in the Hasmonean period.

=== Samaritan version ===
The Samaritan traditions of their history are contained in the &quot;Kitab al-Ta&#x27;rikh&quot; compiled by Abu&#x27;l-Fath in 1355. According to this, a text which Magnar Kartveit identifies as a &quot;fictional&quot; apologia drawn from earlier sources (including Josephus but perhaps also from ancient traditions) a civil war erupted among the Israelites when Eli, son of Yafni, the treasurer of the sons of Israel, sought to usurp the High Priesthood of Israel from the heirs of Phinehas. Gathering disciples and binding them by an oath of loyalty, he sacrificed on the stone altar without using salt, a rite which made High Priest Ozzi rebuke and disown him. Eli and his acolytes revolted and shifted to Shiloh, where he built an alternative temple and an altar, a replica of the original on Mt. Gerizim. Eli&#x27;s sons Hophni and Phinehas had intercourse with women and feasted on the meats of the sacrifice inside the Tabernacle. Thereafter Israel was split into three factions: the original Mt. Gerizim community of loyalists, the breakaway group under Eli, and heretics worshipping idols associated with Hophni and Phinehas. Judaism emerged later with those who followed the example of Eli.

Mount Gerizim was the original Holy Place of the Israelites from the time that Joshua conquered Canaan and the tribes of Israel settled the land. The reference to Mount Gerizim derives from the biblical story of Moses ordering Joshua to take the Twelve Tribes of Israel to the mountains by Shechem (Nablus) and place half of the tribes, six in number, on Mount Gerizim—the Mount of the Blessing—and the other half on Mount Ebal—the Mount of the Curse.

===Biblical versions===
The narratives in Genesis about the rivalries among the 12 sons of Jacob are viewed by some as describing tensions between north and south. According to the Hebrew Bible, they were temporarily united under a United Monarchy, but after the death of King Solomon, the kingdom split in two, the northern Kingdom of Israel with its last capital city Samaria and the southern Kingdom of Judah with its capital Jerusalem. The Deuteronomistic history, written in Judah, portrays Israel as a sinful kingdom, divinely punished for its idolatry and iniquity by being destroyed by the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 720 BCE. The tensions continued in the post-exilic period. The Books of Kings is more inclusive than Ezra–Nehemiah since the ideal is of one Israel with twelve tribes, whereas the Books of Chronicles concentrate on the Kingdom of Judah and ignore the Kingdom of Israel. Accounts of Samaritan origins in respectively 2 Kings 17:6,24 and Chronicles, together with statements in both Ezra and Nehemiah differ in important degrees, suppressing or highlighting narrative details according to the various intentions of their authors.

The emergence of the Samaritans as an ethnic and religious community distinct from other Levant peoples appears to have occurred at some point after the Assyrian conquest of the Kingdom of Israel in approximately 721 BCE. The annals of Sargon II of Assyria indicate that he deported 27,290 inhabitants of the former kingdom. Jewish tradition affirms the Assyrian deportations and replacement of the previous inhabitants by forced resettlement by other peoples but claims a different ethnic origin for the Samaritans. The Talmud accounts for a people called &quot;Cuthim&quot; on a number of occasions, mentioning their arrival by the hands of the Assyrians. According to 2 Kings 17:6, 24 and Josephus, the people of Israel were removed by the king of the Assyrians (Sargon II) to Halah, to Gozan on the Khabur River and to the towns of the Medes. The king of the Assyrians then brought people from Babylon, Kutha, Avva, Hamath and Sepharvaim to place in Samaria. Because God sent lions among them to kill them, the king of the Assyrians sent one of the priests from Bethel to teach the new settlers about God&#x27;s ordinances. The eventual result was that the new settlers worshipped both the God of the land and their own gods from the countries from which they came.

In the Chronicles, following Samaria&#x27;s destruction King Hezekiah is depicted as endeavouring to draw the Ephraimites, Zebulonites, Asherites and Manassites closer to Judah. Temple repairs at the time of Josiah were financed by money from all &quot;the remnant of Israel&quot; in Samaria, including from Manasseh, Ephraim, and Benjamin. Jeremiah likewise speaks of people from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria who brought offerings of frankincense and grain to the House of YHWH. Chronicles makes no mention of an Assyrian resettlement. Yitzakh Magen argues that the version of Chronicles is perhaps closer to the historical truth and that the Assyrian settlement was unsuccessful; he asserts that a notable Israelite population remained in Samaria, part of which (following the conquest of Judah) fled south and settled there as refugees.Adam Zertal dates the Assyrian onslaught at 721 BCE to 647 BCE. From a pottery type he identifies as Mesopotamian clustering around the Menasheh lands of Samaria, he infers that there were three waves of imported settlers. Furthermore, to this day the Samaritans claim descent from the tribe of Joseph.

The &quot;Encyclopaedia Judaica&quot; (under &quot;Samaritans&quot;) summarizes both past and present views on the Samaritans&#x27; origins. It says:

===Josephus&#x27;s version===
Josephus, a key source, has long been considered a prejudiced witness hostile to the Samaritans. He displays an ambiguous attitude, calling them both a distinct, opportunistic ethnos and, alternatively, a Jewish sect.

=== Dead Sea scrolls ===
The Dead Sea scrolls&#x27; proto-Esther fragment 4Q550c has an obscure phrase about the possibility of a &quot;Kutha(ean)&quot;(&quot;Kuti&quot;) man returning but the reference remains obscure. 4Q372 records hopes that the northern tribes will return to the land of Joseph. The current dwellers in the north are referred to as fools, an enemy people. However, they are not referred to as foreigners. It goes on to say that the Samaritans mocked Jerusalem and built a temple on a high place to provoke Israel.

=== Modern scholarship ===
Contemporary scholarship confirms that deportations occurred both before and after the Assyrian conquest of the Kingdom of Israel in 722–720 BCE, with varying impacts across Galilee, Transjordan, and Samaria. During the earlier Assyrian invasions, Galilee and Transjordan experienced significant deportations, with entire tribes vanishing; the tribes of Reuben, Gad, Dan, and Naphtali are never again mentioned. Archaeological evidence from these regions shows that a large depopulation process took place there in the late 8th century BCE, with numerous sites being destroyed, abandoned, or feature a long occupation gap. In contrast, archaeological findings from Samaria—a larger and more populated area—suggest a more mixed picture. While some sites were destroyed or abandoned during the Assyrian invasion, major cities such as Samaria and Megiddo remained largely intact, and other sites show a continuity of occupation. The Assyrians settled exiles from Babylonia, Elam, and Syria in places including Gezer, Hadid, and villages north of Shechem and Tirzah. However, even if the Assyrians deported 30,000 people, as they claimed, many would have remained in the area. Based on changes in material culture, Adam Zertal estimated that only 10% of the Israelite population in Samaria was deported, while the number of imported settlers was likely no more than a few thousand, indicating that most Israelites continued to reside in Samaria.

Gary N. Knoppers described the demography shifts in Samaria following the Assyrian conquest as: &quot;... not the wholesale replacement of one local population by a foreign population, but rather the diminution of the local population&quot;, which he attributed to deaths from war, disease and starvation, forced deportations, and migrations to other regions, particularly south to the Kingdom of Judah. The state-sponsored immigrants who had been forcibly brought into Samaria appear to have generally assimilated into the local population. Nevertheless, the Book of Chronicles records that King Hezekiah of Judah invited members of the tribes of Ephraim, Zebulun, Asher, Issachar and Manasseh to Jerusalem to celebrate Passover after the destruction of Israel. In light of this, it has been suggested that the bulk of those who survived the Assyrian invasions remained in the region. Per this interpretation, the Samaritan community of today is thought to be predominantly descended from those who remained.

The Israeli biblical scholar Shemaryahu Talmon has supported the Samaritan tradition that they are mainly descended from the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh who remained in Israel after the Assyrian conquest. He states that the description of them at 2 Kings 17:24 as foreigners is tendentious and intended to ostracize the Samaritans from those Israelites who returned from the Babylonian exile in 520 BCE. He further states that 2 Chronicles 30:1 could be interpreted as confirming that a large fraction of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh (i.e., Samaritans) remained in Israel after the Assyrian exile. E. Mary Smallwood wrote that the Samaritans &quot;were the survivors of the pre-Exilic northern kingdom of Israel, diluted by intermarriage with alien settlers,&quot; and that they broke away from mainstream Judaism in the 4th century BCE. Archaeologist Eric Cline takes an intermediate view. He believes only 10–20% of the Israelite population (i.e. 40,000 Israelites) were deported to Assyria in 720 BCE. About 80,000 Israelites fled to Judah whilst between 100,000 and 230,000 Israelites remained in Samaria. The latter intermarried with the foreign settlers, thus forming the Samaritans.

The religion of this remnant community is likely distorted by the account recorded in the Books of Kings, which claims that the local Israelite religion was perverted with the injection of foreign customs by Assyrian colonists. In reality, the surviving Samaritans continued to practice Yahwism. This explains why they did not resist Judean kings, such as Hezekiah and Josiah, imposing their religious reforms in Samaria. Magnar Kartveit argues that the people who later became known as Samaritans likely had diverse origins and lived in Samaria and other areas, and it was the temple project on Mount Gerizim that provided the unifying characteristic that allows them to be identified as Samaritans.

Modern genetic studies support the Samaritan narrative that they descend from indigenous Israelites. Shen et al. (2004) formerly speculated that outmarriage with foreign women may have taken place. Most recently the same group came up with genetic evidence that Samaritans are closely linked to Cohanim, and therefore can be traced back to an Israelite population prior to the Assyrian invasion. This correlates with expectations from the fact that the Samaritans retained endogamous and biblical patrilineal marriage customs, and that they remained a genetically isolated population.

== History ==
=== Persian period ===
According to Chronicles 36:22–23, the Persian emperor Cyrus the Great (reigned 559–530 BCE) permits the return of the exiles to their homeland and orders the rebuilding of the Temple (Zion). The prophet Isaiah identifies Cyrus as &quot;the &#x27;s Messiah&quot;. As the Babylonian captivity had primarily affected the lowlands of Judea, the Samarian populations had likely avoided the casualties of the crisis of exile and in fact showed signs of widespread prosperity.

The books of Ezra–Nehemiah detail a lengthy political struggle between Nehemiah, governor of the new Persian province of Yehud Medinata, and Sanballat the Horonite, the governor of Samaria, centered around the refortification of the destroyed Jerusalem. Despite this political discourse, the text implies that relationships between the Jews and Samaritans were otherwise quite amicable, as intermarriage between the two seems commonplace, even to the point that the High Priest Joiada married Sanballat&#x27;s daughter. Some theologians believe Nehemiah 11:3 describes other Israelite tribes returning to Judah with the Judeans. The former lived in the cities of Judah whilst the latter lived in Jerusalem. Benjamites also lived with Judeans in Jerusalem.

During Achaemenid rule, material evidence suggests significant overlap between Jews and proto-Samaritans, with the two groups sharing a common language and script, eschewing the claim that the schism had taken form by this time. However, onomastic evidence suggests the existence of a distinct northern culture. Some inhabitants of Samaria during this period identified with Israelite heritage. This connection is evidenced in two ways: first, through biblical accounts of local officials&#x27; involvement with the Jerusalem Temple, and second, through naming patterns. Many names recorded in the Wadi Daliyeh documents and on Samaritan coins feature Israelite elements. Sanballat&#x27;s sons bore the theophoric Israelite names Delaiah and Shelemiah, while the name &quot;Jeroboam&quot;, used by northern Israelite kings during the monarchic period, also appears on Samaritan coins.

The archaeological evidence can find no sign of habitation in the Assyrian and Babylonian periods at Mount Gerizim but indicates the existence of a sacred precinct on the site in the Persian period by the 5th century BCE. This is not to be interpreted as signaling a precipitous schism between the Jews and Samaritans, as the Gerizim temple was not the only Yahwistic temple outside of Judea. According to most modern scholars, the split between the Jews and Samaritans was a gradual historical process extending over several centuries rather than a single schism at a given point in time.

=== Hellenistic period ===

==== Foreign rule ====

The Macedonian Empire conquered the Levant in the 330s BCE, resulting in both Samaria and Judea coming under Greek rule as the province of Coele-Syria. Samaria was by-and-large devastated by the Macedonian conquest and subsequent colonization efforts, though its southern lands were spared the broader consequences of the invasion and continued to thrive. Matters were further complicated in 331 BCE when the Samaritans rose up in rebellion and murdered the Macedonian-appointed prefect Andromachus, resulting in a brutal reprisal by the army. Following the death of Alexander the Great, the area became part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom, which, in one of several wars, was eventually conquered by the neighboring Seleucid Empire.

Though the temple on Mount Gerizim had existed since the 5th century BCE, evidence shows that its sacred precinct experienced an extravagant expansion during the early Hellenistic era, indicating its status as the preeminent place of Samaritan worship had begun to crystallize. By the time of Antiochus III the Great, the temple &quot;town&quot; had reached 30 dunams in size. The presence of a flourishing cult centered around Gerizim is documented by the sudden resurgence of Yahwistic and Hebrew names in contemporary correspondence, suggesting that the Samaritan community had officially been established by the 2nd century BCE. Overall, the Samaritans were generally more populous and wealthier than the Judeans in Palestine, until 164 BC.

==== Antiochus IV Epiphanes and Hellenization ====
Antiochus IV Epiphanes was on the throne of the Seleucid Empire from 175 to 163 BCE. His policy was to Hellenize his entire kingdom and standardize religious observance. According to 1 Maccabees 1:41-50 he proclaimed himself the incarnation of the Greek god Zeus and mandated death to anyone who refused to worship him. In the 2nd century BCE, a series of events led to a revolution by a faction of Judeans against Antiochus IV.

Anderson notes that during the reign of Antiochus IV:

Josephus quotes the Samaritans as saying:

In the letter, defended as genuine by E. Bickerman and M. Stern, the Samaritans assert their distinction from the Judeans based on both race (γένος) and in customs (ἔθος).

According to II Maccabees:

==== Destruction of the temple ====
During the Hellenistic period, Samaria was largely divided between a Hellenizing faction based in Samaria (Sebastia) and a pious faction in Shechem and surrounding rural areas, led by the High Priest. Samaria was a largely autonomous state nominally dependent on the Seleucid Empire until around 110 BCE, when the Hasmonean ruler John Hyrcanus destroyed the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim and devastated Samaria. Only a few stone remnants of the temple exist today.

Hyrcanus&#x27; campaign of destruction was the watershed moment which confirmed hostile relations between Jews and Samaritans. The actions of the Hasmonean dynasty resulted in widespread Samaritan resentment of, and alienation from, their Judean brethren, resulting in the deterioration of relations between the two that lasted centuries, if not millennia.

=== Roman period ===
Under the Roman Empire, Samaria became a part of the Herodian Tetrarchy, and with the deposition of Herod Archelaus in the early 1st century CE Samaria became a part of the province of Judaea. Samaritans appear briefly in the Christian gospels, most notably in the account of the Samaritan woman at the well and the parable of the Good Samaritan. In the former, it is noted that a substantial number of Samaritans accepted Jesus through the woman&#x27;s testimony to them, and Jesus stayed in Samaria for two days before returning to Cana. In the latter, it is only the Samaritan who helps the man stripped of clothing, beaten, and left on the road half dead, his Abrahamic covenantal circumcision implicitly evident. A priest and a Levite walk past, but the Samaritan helps the naked man regardless of his nakedness (itself religiously offensive to the priest and Levite), his self-evident poverty, or to which Hebrew sect he belongs.

During the First Jewish–Roman War in 67 CE a significant Samaritan uprising gathered on Mt. Gerizim. In response, Roman general Vespasian dispatched a relatively small force under the command of Cerialis. Although some Samaritans surrendered, most fought, resulting in heavy casualties. According to Josephus, 11,600 Samaritans were killed. There is no evidence of Samaritan involvement in later phases of the revolt. In 72/73 CE, Vespasian established Flavia Neapolis on the site of &quot;Mabartha&quot;, near Shechem. While some scholars argue this was to counter Samaritan influence and aspirations, others contend it was primarily a geo-strategic decision. The new city was designed as a polis and included both Samaritan and pagan populations, becoming a major urban center for the Samaritans. Despite its Hellenistic character, the city maintained local traditions, as reflected in its coins which avoided pagan symbols.

The possibility of Samaritan involvement in the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE) alongside the Jews against the Romans remains uncertain. Some Jewish sources, such as the Genesis Rabbah and the Jerusalem Talmud, depict the Samaritans as obstructing Jewish efforts, including the construction of the Temple and the defense of Betar, leading to interpretations of possible Samaritan collaboration with the Romans. However, these sources are considered legendary or anachronistic. Additionally, later Samaritan chronicles referring to the Hadrianic period do not connect events from this time to the Bar Kokhba revolt. Consequently, Mor concludes that there is no concrete evidence of cooperation between Jews and Samaritans during the revolt. The Temple of Gerizim was rebuilt after the Bar Kokhba revolt, around 136 CE. Much of the Samaritan liturgy was set by the high priest Baba Rabba in the 4th century.

=== Byzantine period ===
According to Samaritan sources, Eastern Roman emperor Zeno (who ruled 474–491 and whom the sources call &quot;Zait the King of Edom&quot;) persecuted the Samaritans. The emperor went to Neapolis (Shechem), gathered the elders and asked them to convert to Christianity; when they refused, Zeno had many Samaritans killed and re-built the synagogue as a church. Zeno then took for himself Mount Gerizim and built several edifices, among them a tomb for his recently deceased son, on which he put a cross so that the Samaritans, worshiping God, would prostrate in front of the tomb. By 484 the Samaritans revolted. The rebels attacked Neapolis, burning five churches built on Samaritan holy places and cutting the finger of bishop Terebinthus who was officiating at the ceremony of Pentecost. They elected Justa (or Justasa/Justasus) as their king and moved to Caesarea, where a noteworthy Samaritan community lived. Here several Christians were killed, and the church of St. Sebastian was destroyed. Justa celebrated the victory with games in the circus. According to the Chronicon Paschale, the &quot;dux Palaestinae&quot; Asclepiades, whose troops were reinforced by the Caesarea-based Arcadiani of Rheges, defeated Justa, killed him, and sent his head to Zeno. According to Procopius, Terebinthus went to Zeno to ask for revenge; the emperor personally went to Samaria to quell the rebellion.

Some modern historians believe that the order of the facts preserved by Samaritan sources should be inverted, with the persecution of Zeno as a consequence of the rebellion rather than its cause, and should have happened after 484, around 489. Zeno rebuilt the church of St. Procopius in Neapolis, and the Samaritans were banned from Mount Gerizim, on whose top a signaling tower was built to alert in case of civil unrest.

According to an anonymous biography of Mesopotamian monk Barsauma, whose pilgrimage to the region in the early 5th century was accompanied by clashes with locals and the forced conversion of non-Christians, Barsauma managed to convert Samaritans by conducting demonstrations of healing. Jacob, an ascetic healer living in a cave near Porphyrion, Mount Carmel in the 6th century CE, attracted admirers including Samaritans who later converted to Christianity. Under growing government pressure, many Samaritans who refused to convert to Christianity in the 6th century may have preferred paganism and even Manicheism.

Under a charismatic, messianic figure named Julianus ben Sabar (or ben Sahir), the Samaritans launched a war to create their own independent state in 529. With the help of the Ghassanids, Emperor Justinian I crushed the revolt; tens of thousands of Samaritans died or were enslaved. The Samaritan faith, which had previously enjoyed the status of &quot;religio licita&quot;, was virtually outlawed thereafter by the Christian Byzantine Empire; from a population once at least in the hundreds of thousands, the Samaritan community dwindled to tens of thousands.

The Samaritan population in Samaria did, however, survive the revolts. During a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 570 CE, an anonymous Christian pilgrim from Piacenza travelled through Samaria and recorded the following: &quot;From there we went up past a number of places belonging to Samaria and Judaea to the city of Sebaste, the resting-place of the Prophet Elisha. There were several Samaritan cities and villages on our way down through the plains, and wherever we passed along the streets they burned away our footprints with straw, whether we were Christians or Jews, they have such a horror of both&quot;. The same pilgrim also mentions a place called &quot;Castra Samaritanorum&quot; near Shikmona.

According to Menachem Mor, the decline of the Samaritan population between the 5th and 6th centuries was mostly due to the ongoing Christianization of Palestine&#x27;s inhabitants, rather than the uprisings against the Byzantines. Mor argues that a large number of Samaritans in the cities and towns converted to Christianity, some under pressure and some of their own free will. He claims that both Samaritan and Christian sources preferred to conceal this phenomenon. The Samaritans preferred to attribute their numerical decrease on their resistance to coerced conversion, while the Christians were not willing to admit that the Samaritans were coerced into accepting Christianity and instead preferred to claim that many Samaritans were killed because of their rebellious nature. A change in the local population&#x27;s identity throughout the Byzantine period is not indicated by the archeological findings.

=== Early Islamic period ===
By the time of the Muslim conquest of the Levant, apart from Jund Filastin, small dispersed communities of Samaritans were living in Muslim Egypt, Syria, and Muslim Iran. According to Milka Levy-Rubin, many Samaritans were forced to convert under Abbasid and Tulunid rule (878–905 CE), having been subjected to hardships such as droughts, earthquakes, persecution by local governors, high taxes on religious minorities, and anarchy.

Like other non-Muslims in the empire, such as Jews, Samaritans were often considered to be People of the Book and were guaranteed religious freedom. Their minority status was protected by the Muslim rulers, and they had the right to practice their religion, but as dhimmi, adult males had to pay the jizya or &quot;protection tax&quot;. This however changed during late Abbasid period, with increasing persecution targeting the Samaritan community and considering them infidels which must convert to Islam.

Anarchy overtook Palestine during the early years of Abbasid Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun (813–833 CE), when his rule was challenged by internal strife. According to the Chronicle of Abu l-Fath, during this time, many clashes took place, the locals suffered from famine and even fled their homes out of fear, and &quot;many left their faith&quot;. An exceptional case is of ibn Firāsa, a rebel who arrived in Palestine in 830 and was said to have loathed Samaritans and persecuted them. He punished them, forced them to convert to Islam, and filled the prisons with Samaritan men, women, and children, keeping them there until many of them perished from hunger and thirst. He had also demanded payment for enabling them to circumcise their sons on the eighth day. As a result of the persecution, many Samaritans abandoned their religion at that time. The revolt was put down, but caliph al-Mu&#x27;tasim then increased taxes on the rebels, which sparked a second uprising. Rebel forces captured Nablus, where they set fire to synagogues belonging to the Samaritan and Dosithian (Samaritan sect) faiths. The community&#x27;s situation briefly improved when this uprising was put down by Abbasid forces, and High Priest Pinhas ben Netanel resumed worship in the Nablus synagogue. Under the reign of al-Wāthiq bi-llāh, Abu-Harb Tamim, who had the support of Yaman tribes, led yet another uprising. He captured Nablus and caused many to flee, the Samaritan High Priest was injured and later died of his wounds in Hebron. The Samaritans could not go back to their homes until Abu-Harb tamim was vanquished and captured (842 CE).

A number of restrictions on the dhimmi were reinstituted during the reign of the Abbasid Caliph al-Mutawakkil (847–861 CE), prices increased once more, and many people experienced severe poverty. &quot;Many people lost faith as a result of the terrible price increases and because they became weary of paying the jizya. There were many sons and families who left their faith and became lost&quot;. The tradition of men wearing a red tarboosh may also go back to an order by al-Mutawakkil, that required non-Muslims to be distinguished from Muslims. However, this is disputed because praying while wearing a tarboosh was easier for Muslims, because they put their heads to the ground during Salah (daily prayers).

The numerous instances of Samaritans converting to Islam that are mentioned in the Chronicle of Abu l-Fath are all connected to economic difficulties that led to widespread poverty among the Samaritan population, anarchy that left Samaritans defenseless against Muslim attackers, and attempts by those people and others to force conversion on the Samaritans. It is crucial to keep in mind that the Samaritan community was the smallest among the other dhimmi communities and that it was also situated in Samaria, where Muslim settlement continued to expand as evidenced by the text; by the ninth century, villages such as Sinjil and Jinsafut were already Muslim. This makes it possible to assume that the Samaritans were more vulnerable than other &quot;dhimmi&quot;, what greatly broadened the extent of their Islamization.

Archaeological data demonstrates that during the 8th and 9th centuries, winepresses west of Samaria stopped operating, but the villages to which they belonged persisted. Such sites could be securely identified as Samaritan in some of those cases, and it is likely in others. According to one theory, the local Samaritans who converted to Islam kept their villages going but were barred by Islamic law from making wine. These findings date to the Abbasid period, and are in accordance with the Islamization process as described in the historical sources.

As time goes on, more information from recorded sources refers to Nablus and less to the vast agricultural regions that the Samaritans had previously inhabited. Hence, the Abbasid era marks the disappearance of Samaritan rural habitation in Samaria. By the end of the period, Samaritans were mainly centered in Nablus, while other communities persisted in Caesarea, Cairo, Damascus, Aleppo, Sarepta, and Ascalon. The Samaritans transitioned from speaking Aramaic and Arabic to exclusively speaking Arabic starting from the 11th century onward.

=== Crusader period ===
During the Crusades, the Franks took over Nablus, where the majority of Samaritans lived. Massacres took place in Samaritan maritime communities in Arsuf, Caesarea, Acre and perhaps Ascalon. During the initial razzia in Nablus the invading Franks destroyed Samaritan buildings and sometime later tore down their ritual bath and synagogue on Mt. Gerizim. Christians bearing crosses successfully pleaded for a calm transition. The calamities that befell them during the Frankish reign came from Muslims such as the commander of the Dasmascene army, Bazwȃdj, who raided Nablus in 1137 and abducted 500 Samaritan men, women and children back to Damascus.

=== Ayyubid and Mamluk rule ===
Two hundred Samaritans were reportedly forced to convert to Islam in the village of Immatain by Saladin, according to a tradition recalled by a Samaritan High Priest in the 20th century; however, written sources make no reference to this event.

=== Ottoman rule ===
According to the Ottoman censuses of 1525–1526, 25 Samaritan families lived in Gaza, and 29 families lived in Nablus. In 1548–1549, there were 18 families in Gaza and 34 in Nablus. In 1596–1597, there were 8 families in Gaza, 20 in Nablus and 5 in Safed.

The Samaritan community in Egypt shrank as a result of Ottoman persecution of Samaritans who worked for the Mamluk government, with the majority of them converting to Islam. In Damascus, the majority of the Samaritan community was massacred or converted to Islam during the reign of the Ottoman Pasha Mardam Beqin in the early 17th century. The remainder of the Samaritan community there, in particular the Danafi family, which is still influential today, moved back to Nablus in the 17th century. The Matari family relocated from Gaza to Nablus at about the same time that the Marhiv family moved back from Sarafand, Lebanon. There were no longer any Samaritans in either Gaza or Damascus; only a handful remained in Gaza.

The Nablus community endured because most of the surviving diaspora returned, and they have maintained a tiny presence there to this day. In 1624, the last Samaritan High Priest of the line of Eleazar son of Aaron died without issue, but according to Samaritan tradition, descendants of Aaron&#x27;s other son, Ithamar, remained and took over the office. Following the death of High Priest Shelamia ben Pinhas, Muslim persecution of Samaritans intensified, and they became the target of violent riots that led to many of them converting to Islam. In 1624, access to Mount Gerizim&#x27;s summit was outlawed for the survivors, and they were only permitted to make Passover sacrifices on the mountain&#x27;s eastern slopes. By the middle of the 17th century, very small Samaritan communities survived in Nablus, Gaza, and Jaffa.

The status of the Samaritan community of Nablus greatly improved in the early 18th century because one of them, Ibrahim al-Danafi, who was also a poet and an author, worked for the Tuqan family, which then dominated the city. Al-Danafi also bought the hill of Pinehas and the plot on Mount Gerizim&#x27;s summit to be used by the community, but the favorable conditions that were necessary for the community&#x27;s recovery did not last. The 1759 earthquake, the endemic that followed, and the other restrictions placed on the Samaritans limited the growth of their community, and by the end of the 18th century, there were only 200 people living there and living off of trade, brokerage, and tax collection.

The majority of Samaritan families in the 19th century lived in &quot;Harat el-Somra&quot;, a crowded neighborhood in Nablus&#x27; southwest. During this time, the modest Samaritan synagogue, &quot;el-Kanis&quot;, served as the center of the community&#x27;s cultural, religious, and social life. Some Samaritans worked as clerks for the municipal authorities, while others worked in local small business and crafts in Nablus and its vicinity. Some were forced to collect alms from the growing numbers of tourists and other visitors. To keep their households and organizations functioning, the Samaritan community sometimes even turned to selling ancient manuscripts.

During the 1840s, the ulama of Nablus began asserting that the Samaritans may not be considered &quot;People of the Book&quot; and therefore have the same status as pagans and must convert to Islam or be executed. As a result, locals attempted to force the conversion of two children of a Samaritan widow who had a Muslim lover in 1841. Her young daughter died from fear, but her 14-year-old boy converted to Islam. Another Samaritan was later coerced into converting to Islam. Appealing to the King of France did not help. The Samaritan people were eventually helped by the Jewish Hakham Bashi Chaim Abraham Gagin, who decreed that the Samaritans are &quot;a branch of the children of Israel, who acknowledge the truth of the Torah,&quot; and as such should be protected as a &quot;People of the Book&quot;. As a result, the ulama ceased their preaching against Samaritans. The Samaritans also paid bribes to the Arab Muslims, totaling approximately 1000 GBP, and eventually came out of their hiding places. However, they were prohibited from offering Passover sacrifices on Mount Gerizim until 1849. By the late Ottoman period, the Samaritan community dwindled to its lowest. In the 19th century, with pressure of conversion and persecution from the local rulers, the community fell to just over 100 persons.

=== Mandatory Palestine ===

The situation of the Samaritan community improved significantly during the British Mandate of Palestine. At that time, they began to work in the public sector, like many other groups. With better medical care and Samaritan men marrying Jewish women, the demographic status of the community improved throughout the Mandatory period. The censuses of 1922 and 1931 recorded 163 and 182 Samaritans in Palestine, respectively. 147 lived in Nablus, 12 resided in Tulkarm, 12 in Jaffa, and 6 in As-Salt, Transjordan. Later some moved to Ramat Gan and even to Haifa.

During the 1929 Palestine riots, Arab rioters attacked Samaritans who were performing the Passover sacrifice on Mount Gerizim and flung stones at them as well as their guests. The British police got involved and stopped any potential fatalities.

=== Israeli, Jordanian and Palestinian rule ===
After the establishment of the State of Israel, some of the Samaritans who were living in Jaffa emigrated to Samaria and lived in Nablus. By the late 1950s, around 100 Samaritans left the West Bank for Israel under an agreement with the Jordanian authorities in the West Bank. In 1954, Israeli President Yitzhak Ben-Zvi fostered a Samaritan enclave in Holon, Israel, located in 15a Ben Amram Street. During Jordanian rule in the West Bank, Samaritans from Holon were permitted to visit Mount Gerizim only once a year, on Passover.

In 1967, Israel conquered the West Bank during the Six-Day War, and the Samaritans there came under Israeli rule. Until the 1990s, most of the Samaritans in the West Bank resided in Nablus. They relocated to Mount Gerizim near the Israeli settlement of Har Brakha as a result of violence during the First Intifada (1987–1990). Consequently, all that is left of the Samaritan community in Nablus is an abandoned synagogue. The Israeli army maintains a presence in the area. The Samaritans of Nablus relocated to the village of Kiryat Luza. In the mid-1990s, the Samaritans of Kiryat Luza were granted Israeli citizenship. They also became citizens of the Palestinian Authority following the Oslo Accords. As a result, they are the only people to possess dual Israeli-Palestinian citizenship. 
Today, Samaritans in Israel are fully integrated into society and serve in the Israel Defense Forces. The Samaritans of the West Bank seek good relations with their Palestinian neighbors while maintaining their Israeli citizenship, tend to be fluent in Hebrew and Arabic, and use both a Hebrew and Arab name.

== Genetic studies ==

=== Samaritan lineages ===
Demographic investigations of the Samaritan community were carried out in the 1960s. Detailed pedigrees of the last 13 generations show that the Samaritans comprise four lineages:
* The priestly Cohen lineage from the tribe of Levi.
* The Tsedakah lineage, claiming descent from the tribe of Manasseh
* The Joshua-Marhiv lineage, claiming descent from the tribe of Ephraim
* The Danafi lineage, claiming descent from the tribe of Ephraim

=== Y-DNA and mtDNA comparisons ===
Recently several genetic studies on the Samaritan population were made using haplogroup comparisons as well as wide-genome genetic studies. Of the 12 Samaritan males used in the analysis, 10 (83%) had Y chromosomes belonging to haplogroup J, which includes three of the four Samaritan families. The Joshua-Marhiv family belongs to Haplogroup J-M267 (formerly &quot;J1&quot;), while the Danafi and Tsedakah families belong to haplogroup J-M172 (formerly &quot;J2&quot;), and can be further distinguished by the M67 SNP—the derived allele of which has been found in the Danafi family—and the PF5169 SNP found in the Tsedakah family. However the biggest and most important Samaritan family, the Cohen family (Tradition: Tribe of Levi), was found to belong to haplogroup E.

A 2004 article on the genetic ancestry of the Samaritans by Shen &quot;et al.&quot; concluded from a sample comparing Samaritans to several Jewish populations, all currently living in Israel—representing the Beta Israel, Ashkenazi Jews, Iraqi Jews, Libyan Jews, Moroccan Jews, and Yemenite Jews, as well as Israeli Druze and Palestinians—that &quot;the principal components analysis suggested a common ancestry of Samaritan and Jewish patrilineages. Most of the former may be traced back to a common ancestor in what is today identified as the paternally inherited Israelite high priesthood (Cohanim) with a common ancestor projected to the time of the Assyrian conquest of the kingdom of Israel.&quot; The mitochondrial lineages of Samaritans were closest to Iraqi Jewish and Palestinian mtDNA sequences.

== Demographics ==
=== Figures ===
There were 1 million Samaritans in biblical times, but in recent times the numbers are smaller. There were 100 in 1786 and 141 in 1919, then 150 in 1967. This grew to 745 in 2011, 751 in 2012, 756 in 2013, 760 in 2014, 777 in 2015, 785 in 2016, 796 in 2017, 810 in 2018 and 820 in 2019. The Samaritan community dropped in numbers during the various periods of Muslim rule in the region. The Samaritans could not rely on foreign assistance as much as the Christians did, nor on a large number of diaspora immigrants as did the Jews. The once-flourishing community declined over time, either through emigration or conversion to Islam among those who remained.Today, half reside in modern homes at Kiryat Luza on Mount Gerizim, which is sacred to them, and the rest in Holon. There are also four Samaritan families residing in Binyamina-Giv&#x27;at Ada, Matan, and Ashdod. As a small community physically divided between neighbors in a hostile region, Samaritans have been hesitant to overtly take sides in the Arab–Israeli conflict, fearing that doing so could lead to negative repercussions. Samaritans who are Israeli citizens are drafted into the military, along with the Jewish citizens of Israel.

Relations of Samaritans with Israeli Jews, Muslim and Christian Palestinians in neighboring areas have been mixed. Samaritans living in both Israel and in the West Bank have Israeli citizenship.

Samaritans in the Palestinian Authority-ruled territories are a minority in the midst of a Muslim majority. They had a reserved seat in the Palestinian Legislative Council in the election of 1996, but they no longer have one. Samaritans living in the West Bank have been granted passports by both Israel and the Palestinian Authority.

=== Community survival ===
One of the biggest problems facing the community today is the issue of continuity. With such a small population, divided into only four families or houses (Cohen, Tsedakah, Danafi, and Marhiv, with the Matar family dying out in 1968), and a general refusal to accept converts, it is common for Samaritans to marry within their extended families, even first cousins. There has been a history of genetic disorders within the group due to the small gene pool. To counter this, the Holon Samaritan community has allowed men from the community to marry non-Samaritan (primarily Israeli Jewish) women, provided that the women agree to follow Samaritan religious practices. There is a six-month trial period before officially joining the Samaritan community to see whether this is a commitment that the woman would like to take. This often poses a problem for the women, who are typically less than eager to adopt the strict interpretation of biblical (Levitical) laws regarding menstruation, by which they must live in a separate dwelling during their periods and after childbirth. There have been a few instances of intermarriage. In addition, all marriages within the Samaritan community are first approved by a geneticist at Tel HaShomer Hospital, in order to prevent the spread of genetic disorders. In meetings arranged by &quot;international marriage agencies&quot;, a small number of women from Russia and Ukraine who agree to observe Samaritan religious practices have been allowed to marry into the Qiryat Luza Samaritan community in an effort to expand the gene pool. Polygamy is reported to have been practiced among Samaritans up until sometime in the 19th century. Today it is practically unheard of, due to the low availability of women and, among those Samaritans living within Israeli territory, it being illegal.

The Samaritan community in Israel also faces demographic challenges as some young people leave the community and convert to Judaism. A notable example is Israeli television presenter Sofi Tsedaka, who has made a documentary about her leaving the community at age 18.

The head of the community is the Samaritan High Priest, who is the 133rd generation since Ithamar, a son of Aaron the priest&#x27;s line from 1624 CE onward; before then, the line of priesthood went through Elazar, son of Aaron the priest. The current high priest is Aabed-El ben Asher ben Matzliach who assumed the office on 19 April 2013. The High Priest of every generation is selected by the eldest in age from the priestly family and resides on Mount Gerizim.

=== Samaritan origins of Palestinian Muslims in Nablus and its vicinity ===
Much of the local Palestinian population of Nablus is believed to be descended from Samaritans who converted to Islam. Traditions of Samaritan ancestry were also recorded in villages in the vicinity, such as Hajjah. Even today, certain Nabulsi family names such as Al-Amad, Al-Samri, Maslamani, Yaish, and Shakhsheer among others, are associated with Samaritan ancestry. The Yaish family of Nablus, for example, is said to be descended from the Samaritan Mitawiyah family of the Tribe of Manasseh, founded by Mitwayyah, who himself descended from Magged, a person who lived in the 7th century.

According to the historian Fayyad Altif, large numbers of Samaritans converted due to persecution under various Muslim rulers, and because the monotheistic nature of Islam made it easy for them to accept it. During the Abbasid period, economic hardships, social disorder, and pressure from Muslim attackers, drove many Samaritans to convert to Islam. Later, the al-Hakim Edict issued by the Fatimid Caliphate in 1021, ordering Jews and Christians in the Southern Levant to convert to Islam or leave, along with another forced conversion by the rebel ibn Firāsa, hastened the Samaritans&#x27; rapid decline and nearly led to their extinction as a distinct religious community. The Samaritans themselves describe the Ottoman period as the worst period in their modern history, as many Samaritan families were forced to convert to Islam during that time. As a result, the Samaritans decreased from nearly a million and a half in late Roman (Byzantine) times to 146 people by the end of the Ottoman period.

Samaritan historian Benyamim Tsedaka noted that many Samaritans who converted to Islam retained their original surnames, passing them on to future generations. Consequently, in most villages with names of Hebrew origin, but altered by Arabic pronunciation, Arab families still bear the surnames of their Samaritan ancestors. In Nablus itself, he notes, some Muslims openly acknowledge their Samaritan ancestry. For instance, in 1968, Fatah militant Naser Sharshir suggested the possibility of having Samaritan blood in his lineage, tracing back to his great-grandfather.

In 1940, Israeli historian and future president Yitzhak Ben-Zvi wrote an article in which he stated that two thirds of the residents of Nablus and the surrounding neighboring villages were of Samaritan origin. He mentioned the name of several Palestinian Muslim families as having Samaritan origins, including the Al-Amad, Al-Samri, Buwarda and Kasem families, who protected Samaritans from Muslim persecution in the 1850s. Additionally, he wrote that these families had written records testifying to their Samaritan ancestry, which were maintained by their priests and elders.

== Samaritanism ==

Samaritanism is centered on the Samaritan Pentateuch, which Samaritans believe to be the original and unaltered version of the Torah that was given to Moses and the Israelites on Mount Sinai. The Samaritan Pentateuch contains some differences from the Masoretic version of the Torah used in Judaism; according to Samaritan tradition, key parts of the Jewish text were fabricated by Ezra. The Samaritan version of the Book of Joshua also differs from the Jewish version, which focuses on Shiloh. According to Samaritan tradition, Joshua built a temple (&quot;al-haikal&quot;) on Mount Gerizim and placed therein a tabernacle (&quot;al-maškan&quot;) in the second year of the Israelites&#x27; entry into the land of Canaan.

According to Samaritan scripture and tradition, Mount Gerizim, located near the Biblical city of Shechem (on the southern side of modern-day Nablus, West Bank), has been venerated as the holiest place for the Israelites since the conquest of Canaan by Joshua, long before the Temple in Jerusalem was established under Davidic and Solomonic rule over the United Kingdom of Israel. This view differs from Jewish belief which views the Temple Mount in Jerusalem as the holiest site in the world to worship God. It is commonly taught in Samaritan tradition that there are 13 references to Mount Gerizim in the Torah to prove their claim of holiness in contrast to Judaism, which relies solely on the later Jewish prophets and writings to back their claims of the holiness of Jerusalem.

Other Samaritan tradition books include the Memar Marqah (The teachings of Marqah), the Samaritan liturgy known as &quot;the Defter&quot;, and Samaritan law codes and biblical commentaries.

Samaritans outside the Holy Land observe most Samaritan practices and rituals such as the Sabbath, ritual purity, and all festivals of Samaritanism with the exception of the Passover sacrifice, which can only be observed at Mount Gerizim.

=== Location of sacrifice ===
According to Samaritans, it was on Mount Gerizim that Abraham was commanded by God to offer his son Isaac as a sacrifice. God then causes the sacrifice to be interrupted, explaining that this was the ultimate test of Abraham&#x27;s obedience, as a result of which all the world would be blessed.

The Torah mentions the place where God chooses to establish his name (Deuteronomy 12:5), and Judaism believes this refers to Jerusalem. In contrast, the Samaritan text speaks of the place where God to establish his name, and Samaritans identify it as Mount Gerizim, making it the focus of their spiritual values.

The legitimacy of the Judaic versus Samaritan belief was argued by Jewish scholar Andronicus ben Meshullam in the 2nd century BCE at the court of King Ptolemy VI Philometor.

In the New Testament, the Gospel of John describes an encounter between a Samaritan woman and Jesus. When the woman realizes that Jesus is the Messiah, she asks Him whether Mount Gerizim or Jerusalem is where God commanded Abraham to bind Isaac. Jesus affirms the Judaic belief, saying &quot;You [the Samaritans] worship what you do not know&quot;; although he also says, &quot;a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.&quot;

=== Religious beliefs ===

* There is one God, YHWH, (informally referred to by Samaritans as Shema), the same God recognized by the Hebrew prophets.
* The Torah was given by God to Moses.
* Mount Gerizim, not Jerusalem, is the one true sanctuary chosen by Israel&#x27;s God.
* Many Samaritans believe that at the end of days, the dead will be resurrected by the Taheb, a restorer (possibly a prophet, some say Moses).
* Resurrection and Paradise. Samaritans accept the resurrection of the dead on the basis of Deuteronomy 32 also known as the Song of Moses, a tradition that is traced back to their sage Marqah.
* The priests are the interpreters of the law and the keepers of tradition; scholars are secondary to the priesthood.
* The authority of post-Torah sections of the Tanakh, and classical Jewish Rabbinical works (the Talmud, comprising the Mishnah and the Gemara) is rejected.
* They have a significantly different version of the Ten Commandments (for example, their 10th commandment is about the sanctity of Mount Gerizim).

The Samaritans have retained an offshoot of the Ancient Hebrew script, a High Priesthood, the slaughtering and eating of lambs on Passover eve, and the celebration of the first month&#x27;s beginning around springtime as the New Year. Yom Teru&#x27;ah (the biblical name for &quot;Rosh Hashanah&quot;), at the beginning of Tishrei, is not considered a New Year as it is in Rabbinic Judaism. The Samaritan Pentateuch differs from the Jewish Masoretic Text as well. Some differences are doctrinal: for example, the Samaritan Torah explicitly states that Mount Gerizim is &quot;the place that God &quot; to establish his name, as opposed to the Jewish Torah that refers to &quot;the place that God &quot;. Other differences are minor and seem more or less accidental.

=== Relationship to Rabbinic Judaism ===
Samaritans refer to themselves as &quot;Benai Yisrael&quot; (&quot;Children of Israel&quot;), which is a term used by all Jewish denominations as a name for the Jewish people as a whole. They, however, do not refer to themselves as &quot;Yehudim&quot; (literally &quot;Judeans&quot;), the standard Hebrew name for Jews.

The Talmudic attitude expressed in tractate Kutim is that they are to be treated as Jews in matters where their practice coincides with Rabbinic Judaism but as non-Jews where their practice differs. Some claim that since the 19th century, Rabbinic Judaism has regarded the Samaritans as a Jewish sect and the term &quot;Samaritan Jews&quot; has been used for them.

=== Religious texts ===
Samaritan law is not the same as Halakha (Rabbinic Jewish law). The Samaritans have several groups of religious texts, which correspond to Jewish Halakha. A few examples of such texts are:

* Torah
** &quot;Samaritan Pentateuch&quot;: There are some 6,000 differences between the Samaritan Pentateuch and the Masoretic Jewish Pentateuch text; and, according to one estimate, 1,900 points of agreement between it and the Greek LXX version. Several passages in the New Testament would also appear to echo a Torah textual tradition consistent with that conserved in the Samaritan text. There are several theories regarding the similarities. The variations, some corroborated by readings in the Old Latin, Syriac and Ethiopian translations, attest to the antiquity of the Samaritan text.
* Historical writings
** &quot;Samaritan Chronicle, The Tolidah&quot; (Creation to the time of Abishah)
** &quot;Samaritan Chronicle&quot;, The Chronicle of Joshua (Israel during the time of divine favor) (4th century, in Arabic and Aramaic)
** &quot;Samaritan Chronicle, Adler&quot; (Israel from the time of divine disfavor until the exile)
** &quot;Samaritan Chronicle,&quot; The Kitab al-Tarikh of Abu &#x27;l-Fath (Historical chronology from Adam to Mohammad)
* Hagiographical texts
** &quot;Samaritan Halakhic Text&quot;, The Hillukh (Code of Halakha, marriage, circumcision, etc.)
** &quot;Samaritan Halakhic Text&quot;, The Kitab at-Tabbah (Halakha and interpretation of some verses and chapters from the Torah, written by Abu Al Hassan 12th century CE)
** &quot;Samaritan Halakhic Text&quot;, The Kitab al-Kafi (Book of Halakha, written by Yosef Al Ascar 14th century CE)
** &quot;Al-Asatir&quot;—legendary Aramaic texts from the 11th and 12th centuries, containing:
*** &quot;Haggadic Midrash&quot;, Abu&#x27;l Hasan al-Suri
*** &quot;Haggadic Midrash&quot;, Memar Markah—3rd or 4th century theological treatises attributed to &quot;Hakkam&quot; Markha
*** &quot;Haggadic Midrash&quot;, Pinkhas on the Taheb
*** &quot;Haggadic Midrash&quot;, Molad Maseh (On the birth of Moses)
* &quot;Defter&quot;, prayer book of psalms and hymns.
* &quot;Samaritan Haggadah&quot;

== Christian sources: New Testament ==
Samaria or Samaritans are mentioned in the New Testament books of Matthew, Luke, John and Acts. The Gospel of Mark contains no mention of Samaritans or Samaria. The best known reference to the Samaritans is the Parable of the Good Samaritan, found in the Gospel of Luke. The following references are found:
* When instructing his disciples as to how they should spread the word, Jesus tells them not to visit any Gentile or Samaritan city, but instead, go to the &quot;lost sheep of Israel&quot;.
* A Samaritan village rejected a request from messengers travelling ahead of Jesus for hospitality, because the villagers did not want to facilitate a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, a practice which they saw as a violation of the Law of Moses. Two of his disciples want to &quot;call down fire from heaven and destroy them,&quot; but Jesus rebukes them.
* The Parable of the Good Samaritan.
* Jesus healed ten lepers, of whom only one returned to praise God, and he was a Samaritan.
* Jesus asks a Samaritan woman of Sychar for water from Jacob&#x27;s Well, and after spending two days telling her townsfolk &quot;all things&quot; as the woman expected the Messiah to do, and presumably repeating the Good News that he is the Messiah, many Samaritans become followers of Jesus. He accepts without comment the woman&#x27;s assertion that she and her people are Israelites, descendants of Jacob.
* Jesus is accused of being a Samaritan and being demon-possessed. He denies the latter accusation explicitly, and denies the former previously—having already done so in his conversation with the Samaritan woman.
* Christ tells the apostles that they would receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon them and that they would be his witnesses in &quot;Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.&quot;
* The Apostles are being persecuted. Philip preaches the Gospel to a city in Samaria, and the Apostles in Jerusalem hear about it. So they send the Apostles Peter and John to pray for and lay hands on the baptized believers, who then receive the Holy Spirit (vs. 17). They then return to Jerusalem, preaching the Gospel &quot;in many villages of the Samaritans&quot;.
* Acts 9:31 says that at that time the churches had &quot;rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria&quot;.
* Acts 15:2–3 says that Paul and Barnabas were &quot;being brought on their way by the church&quot; and that they passed through &quot;Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles&quot;. (&quot;Phoenicia&quot; in several other English versions).

<text>Seneca Lake is the largest of the glacial Finger Lakes of the U.S. state of New York, and the deepest glacial lake entirely within the state. It is promoted as the lake trout capital of the world, and is host of the National Lake Trout Derby. Because of its depth and relative ease of access, the US Navy uses Seneca Lake to perform test and evaluation of equipment ranging from single element transducers to complex sonar arrays and systems.
The lake takes its name from the Seneca nation of Native Americans. At the north end of Seneca Lake is the city of Geneva, New York, home of Hobart and William Smith Colleges and the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station, a division of Cornell University. At the south end of the lake is the village of Watkins Glen, New York, famed for auto racing (hosting Watkins Glen International racetrack) and waterfalls.

Due to Seneca Lake&#x27;s unique macroclimate it is home to over 50 wineries, many of them farm wineries and is the location of the Seneca Lake AVA. (See Seneca Lake wine trail).

==Description==

At long, it is the second longest of the Finger Lakes and has the largest volume, estimated at , roughly half of the water in all the Finger Lakes. It has an average depth of , a maximum depth of , and a surface area of .

For comparison, Scotland&#x27;s famous Loch Ness is long, wide, has a surface area of , an average depth of , a maximum depth of , and total volume of of water.

Seneca&#x27;s two main inlets are Catharine Creek at the southern end and the Keuka Lake Outlet. Seneca Lake lets out into the Seneca River/ Cayuga-Seneca Canal, which joins Seneca and Cayuga Lakes at their northern ends.

It is fed by underground springs and replenished at a rate of 328,000 gallons (1240 m³) per minute. These springs keep the water moving in a circular motion, giving it little chance to freeze over. Because of Seneca Lake&#x27;s great depth its temperature remains a near-constant . In summer the top warms to .

==Ecology==
Seneca lake has a typical aquatic population for large deep lakes in the northeast, with coldwater fish such as lake trout and Landlocked Atlantic salmon inhabiting the deeper waters, and warmwater fish such as smallmouth bass and yellow perch inhabiting the shallower areas. The lake is also home to a robust population of &quot;sawbellies,&quot; the local term for alewife shad.

==History==

Seneca Lake was formed at least two million years ago by glacial carving of streams and valleys. Originally it was a part of a series of rivers that flowed northward. Around this time many continental glaciers moved into the area and started the Pleistocene glaciation also known as the Ice Age. It is presumed that the Finger Lakes were created by many advances and retreats of massive glaciers that were up to 2 miles thick.

Over 200 years ago, there were Iroquois villages on Seneca Lake&#x27;s surrounding hillsides. During the American Revolutionary War, their villages, including Kanadaseaga (&quot;Seneca Castle&quot;), were wiped out during the 1779 Sullivan Expedition.

After the war, the Iroquois were forced to cede their land when Britain was defeated. Their millions of acres were sold and some lands in this area were granted to veterans of the army in payment for their military service. A slow stream of European-American settlers began to arrive circa 1790. Initially the settlers were without a market nearby or a way to get their crops to market. The settlers&#x27; isolation ended in 1825 with the opening of the Erie Canal.

The canal linked the Finger Lakes Region to the outside world. Steamships, barges and ferries quickly became Seneca Lake&#x27;s ambassadors of commerce and trade. The former, short Crooked Lake Canal linked Seneca Lake to Keuka Lake.

Numerous canal barges sank during operations and rest on the bottom of the lake. A collection of barges at the southwest end of the lake, near the village of Watkins Glen, is being preserved and made accessible for scuba diving by the Finger Lakes Underwater Preserve Association.

==Recreation==
===Fishing===
The lake is a popular fishing destination. Fish species in the lake include lake trout, rainbow trout, brown trout, landlocked salmon, largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, northern pike, pickerel, and yellow perch.

==Folklore==
===Sea serpent===
In July 1900, newspaper reports carried reports that on the evening of 14 July 1899, the steamboat Otetiani, carrying several dozen passengers, encountered a 25-foot-long sea monster with &quot;two rows of sharp, white teeth.&quot; The steamer is said to have given chase to the creature and deliberately rammed it at full speed. The creature was struck by the ship&#x27;s paddle wheel midway between head and tail, it spine broken. It raised its four-foot-long head, then gave a gasp as it died. The ship attempted to rope the monster and tow it back to shore, but it sank to the bottom of Seneca Lake. A report sometime later in the &quot;Geneva Gazette&quot; suggested that the incident was a hoax.

===Painted rocks===
The painted rocks located at the southern end of the lake on the eastern cliff face depict an American flag, tee-pee, and several Native Americans. The older paintings, located on the bottom of the cliff, were said to have been drawn in 1779 after the Senecas escaped men from John Sullivan&#x27;s campaign. However, this account is questioned by historian Barbara Bell, arguing that it is unlikely that the Senecas would have returned to paint the paintings having just escaped from Sullivan&#x27;s men. She suggests instead that these paintings may have been made much later, for tourists on Seneca Lake boat tours.

It is known that the more visible and prominent paintings of the Native Americans, American flag, and tee-pee were added in 1929 during the Sullivan Sesquicentennial. There are two mistakes in these 1929 additions: firstly the Native Americans in the Seneca Region used longhouses and not tee-pees, and secondly the flag is displayed pointing to the left which is never to be done on a horizontal surface.

===Seneca Guns===
Seneca Lake is also the site of strange and currently unexplained cannon-like booms and shakes that are heard and felt in the surrounding area. They are known locally as the Seneca Guns, Lake Drums, or Lake Guns, and these types of phenomena are known elsewhere as skyquakes. The term Lake Guns originated in the short story &quot;The Lake Gun&quot; by James Fenimore Cooper in 1851. There is no explanation that takes into account sounds the Iroquois heard before Cooper&#x27;s time; it is possible sonic booms have been mistaken for natural sounds in modern days.

==Sampson Navy and Air Force bases==
The east side of Seneca Lake was once home to a military training ground called Sampson Naval Base, primarily used during World War II. It became Sampson Air Force Base during the Korean War and was used for basic training. After Sampson AFB closed, the airfield remained as Seneca Army Airfield but was closed in 2000. The training grounds of Sampson have since been converted to a civilian picnic area called Sampson State Park.

There is still a Naval facility at Seneca Lake, the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Sonar test facility. A scale model of the sonar section of the nuclear submarine USS Seawolf (SSN 21) was tested during the development of this ship, which was launched in June, 1995.

==Water quality==

There is a YSI EMM-2500 Buoy Platform located in the north end of Seneca Lake roughly in the center. Its coordinates are: latitude: 42°41&#x27;49.99&quot;N, longitude: 76°55&#x27;29.93&quot;W. The buoy has cellular modem communications and measures wind speed and direction, relative humidity, air temperature, barometric pressure, light intensity, and the water&#x27;s depth and temperature, conductivity, turbidity, and chlorophyll-a levels.

The buoy was initially deployed in June 2006. The water depth where it is located is about .

On June 30, 2022, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation denied a request for an air permit for a natural gas power plant owned by Greenidge Generation, a bitcoin mining company, on the lake used for powering an 8,000-machine operation which the company argued had no legal basis and would challenge in court in a press statement.

==Wine==

Viticulture and winemaking in the area date back to the 19th century, with the foundation of the Seneca Lake Wine Company in 1866 marking the first major winery in the area. The modern era of wine production began in the 1970s with the establishment of several wineries and the passage of the New York Farm Winery Act of 1976. The region was established as an American Viticultural Area in 1988.

Seneca Lake Wine Trail hosts many events on and around the lake including the annual winter &#x27;Deck the Halls&#x27; event, at which local wineries showcase their vintages.

==Transport==
The Elmira &amp; Seneca Lake Railway opened for operation on 19 June 1900 from Horseheads, New York to Seneca Lake. An active railroad track still runs along the west side of the lake from Watkins Glen to Geneva and beyond, operated by Finger Lakes Railway.

<text>The Strait of Gibraltar is a narrow strait that connects the Atlantic Ocean to the Mediterranean Sea and separates Europe from Africa.
The two continents are separated by 7.7 nautical miles (14.2 kilometers, 8.9 miles) at its narrowest point. Ferries cross between the two continents every day in as little as 35 minutes. The Strait&#x27;s depth ranges between .

The strait lies in the territorial waters of Morocco, Spain, and the British overseas territory of Gibraltar. Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, foreign vessels and aircraft have the freedom of navigation and overflight to cross the strait of Gibraltar in case of continuous transit.

== Names and etymology ==
The name comes from the Rock of Gibraltar, which in turn originates from the Arabic (meaning &quot;Tariq&#x27;s Mount&quot;), named after Tariq ibn Ziyad. It is also known as the Straits of Gibraltar, the Gut of Gibraltar (although this is mostly archaic), the STROG (STRait Of Gibraltar) in naval use.

Another Arabic name is &quot;Bāb al-&quot;maghrib&quot;&quot; (), meaning &quot;Gate of the West&quot; or &quot;Gate of the sunset&quot;, and furthermore &quot;Gate of the Maghreb&quot; or &quot;Gate of Morocco&quot;. In the Middle Ages it was called in Arabic ( &#x27;the Passage&#x27;), or ( &#x27;the passage sea&#x27;) and by the Romans (Strait of Cadiz).

In Latin it has been called , based on the name from antiquity &quot;Pillars of Hercules&quot; (), referring to the mountains as pillars, such as Gibraltar, flanking the strait.

==Location==

On the northern side of the Strait are Spain and Gibraltar (a British overseas territory in the Iberian Peninsula). On the southern side are Morocco and Ceuta (a Spanish autonomous city in northern Africa).

Due to its location, the Strait is commonly used for illegal immigration from Africa to Europe.

===Extent===
The International Hydrographic Organization defines the limits of the Strait of Gibraltar as follows:
==Geology==

The seabed of the Strait is composed of synorogenic Betic-Rif clayey flysch covered by Pliocene and/or Quaternary calcareous sediments, sourced from thriving cold water coral communities. Exposed bedrock surfaces, coarse sediments and local sand dunes attest to the strong bottom current conditions at the present time.

Around 5.9 million years ago, the connection between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean along the Betic and Rifan Corridor was progressively restricted until its total closure, effectively causing the salinity of the Mediterranean to rise periodically within the gypsum and salt deposition range, during what is known as the Messinian salinity crisis. In this water chemistry environment, dissolved mineral concentrations, temperature and stilled water currents combined and occurred regularly to precipitate many mineral salts in layers on the seabed. The resultant accumulation of various huge salt and mineral deposits about the Mediterranean basin are directly linked to this era. It is believed that this process took a short time, by geological standards, lasting between 500,000 and 600,000 years.

It is estimated that, were the Strait closed even at today&#x27;s higher sea level, most water in the Mediterranean basin would evaporate within a thousand years, as it is believed to have done then, and such an event would lay down mineral deposits like the salt deposits now found under the sea floor all over the Mediterranean.

After a lengthy period of restricted intermittent or no water exchange between the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean basin, approximately 5.33 million years ago, the Atlantic–Mediterranean connection was completely reestablished through the Strait of Gibraltar by the Zanclean flood, and has remained open ever since. The erosion produced by the incoming waters seems to be the main cause for the present depth of the Strait ( at the narrows, at the Camarinal Sill). The Strait is expected to close again as the African Plate moves northward relative to the Eurasian Plate, but on geological rather than human timescales.

==Biodiversity==
The Strait has been identified as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of the hundreds of thousands of seabirds which use it every year to migrate between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic, including significant numbers of Scopoli&#x27;s and Balearic shearwaters, Audouin&#x27;s and lesser black-backed gulls, razorbills, and Atlantic puffins.

A resident orca pod of some 36 individuals lives around the Strait, one of the few that are left in Western European waters. The pod may be facing extinction in the coming decades due to long term effects of PCB pollution.

==History==

Evidence of the first human habitation of the area by Neanderthals dates back to 125,000 years ago. It is believed that the Rock of Gibraltar may have been one of the last outposts of Neanderthal habitation in the world, with evidence of their presence there dating to as recently as 24,000 years ago. Archaeological evidence of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; habitation of the area dates back years.

The relatively short distance between the two shores has served as a quick crossing point for various groups and civilizations throughout history, including Carthaginians campaigning against Rome, Romans travelling between the provinces of Hispania and Mauritania, Vandals raiding south from Germania through Western Rome and into North Africa in the 5th century, Moors and Berbers in the 8th–11th centuries, and Spain and Portugal in the 16th century.

Beginning in 1492, the Strait began to play a certain cultural role in acting as a barrier against cross-channel conquest and the flow of culture and language that would naturally follow such a conquest. In that year, the last Muslim government north of the Strait was overthrown by a Spanish force. Since that time, the Strait has come to foster the development of two very distinct and varied cultures on either side of it after sharing much the same culture for over 500 years from the 8th century to the early 13th century.

On the northern side, Christian-European culture has remained dominant since the expulsion of the last Muslim kingdom in 1492, along with the Romance Spanish language, while on the southern side, Muslim-Arabic/Mediterranean has been dominant since the spread of Islam into North Africa in the 700s, along with the Arabic language.

The small British enclave of the city of Gibraltar presents a third cultural group found in the Strait. This enclave was ceded in perpetuity to Britain in the Peace of Utrecht. Gibraltar has since been used by the United Kingdom to act as a surety for control of the sea lanes into and out of the Mediterranean.

Following the Spanish coup of July 1936 the Spanish Republican Navy tried to blockade the Strait of Gibraltar to hamper the transport of Army of Africa troops from Spanish Morocco to Peninsular Spain. On 5 August 1936 the so-called Convoy de la Victoria was able to bring at least 2,500 men across the Strait, breaking the republican blockade.

==Communications==
The Strait is an important shipping route from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Ferries operate between Spain and Morocco across the Strait, as well as between Spain and Ceuta and Gibraltar to Tangier.

=== Tunnel across the Strait ===
Discussion between Spain and Morocco of a tunnel under the strait began in the 1980s. In December 2003, both countries agreed to explore the construction of an undersea rail tunnel to connect their rail systems across the Strait. The gauge of the rail would be to match the proposed construction and conversion of significant parts of the existing broad gauge system to standard gauge. While the project remained in a planning phase, Spanish and Moroccan officials met to discuss it occasionally, including in 2012. Those talks led to nothing constructive happening, but in April 2021 ministers from both countries agreed to a joint intergovernmental meeting to be held in Casablanca in the coming months. This was in order to resume discussions on a tunnel. Earlier, in January 2021, the UK government had studied plans for a tunnel to link Gibraltar with Tangiers that would replace the Spanish-Moroccan project that until then had had no tangible results after over 40 years of discussions.

==Special flow and wave patterns==
The Strait of Gibraltar links the Atlantic Ocean directly to the Mediterranean Sea. This direct linkage creates certain unique flow and wave patterns. These unique patterns are created due to the interaction of various regional and global evaporative forces, water temperatures, tidal forces, and wind forces.

===Inflow and outflow===
Water flows through the Strait more or less continuously, both eastwards and westwards. A smaller amount of deeper, saltier and therefore denser waters continually flow westwards (the Mediterranean outflow), while a larger amount of surface waters with lower salinity and density continually flow eastwards (the Mediterranean inflow). These general flow tendencies may be occasionally interrupted for brief periods by temporary tidal flows, depending on various lunar and solar alignments. The balance of the water flow is eastwards, since the evaporation rate within the Mediterranean basin is higher than the combined inflow of all the rivers that empty into it, plus the total precipitation of rain or snow that falls on it. At the Strait&#x27;s far western end is the Camarinal Sill, the Strait&#x27;s shallowest point which limits mixing between the cold, less saline Atlantic water and the warmer, more saline Mediterranean waters.

The Mediterranean waters are so much saltier than the Atlantic waters that they sink below the constantly incoming water and form a highly saline (&quot;thermohaline&quot;, both warm and salty) layer of bottom water. This layer of bottom-water constantly works its way out into the Atlantic as the Mediterranean outflow. On the Atlantic side of the Strait, a density boundary separates the Mediterranean outflow waters from the rest at about depth. These waters flow out and down the continental slope, losing salinity, until they begin to mix and equilibrate more rapidly, much farther out at a depth of about . The Mediterranean outflow water layer can be traced for thousands of kilometres west of the Strait, before completely losing its identity.
During the Second World War, German U-boats used the currents to pass into the Mediterranean Sea without detection, by maintaining silence with engines off. From September 1941 to May 1944 Germany managed to send 62 U-boats into the Mediterranean. All these boats had to navigate the British-controlled Strait of Gibraltar where nine U-boats were sunk while attempting passage and 10 more had to break off their run due to damage.

===Internal waves===
Internal waves (waves at the density boundary layer) are often produced by the Strait. Like traffic merging on a highway, the water flow is constricted in both directions because it must pass over the Camarinal Sill. When large tidal flows enter the Strait and the high tide relaxes, internal waves are generated at the Camarinal Sill and proceed eastwards. Even though the waves may occur down to great depths, occasionally the waves are almost imperceptible at the surface, at other times they can be seen clearly in satellite imagery. These &quot;internal waves&quot; continue to flow eastward and to refract around coastal features. They can sometimes be traced for as much as , and sometimes create interference patterns with refracted waves.

==Territorial waters==

Except for its far eastern end, the Strait lies within the territorial waters of Spain and Morocco. The United Kingdom claims around Gibraltar on the northern side of the Strait, putting part of it inside British territorial waters. As this is less than the maximum, it means, according to the British claim, that part of the Strait lies in international waters. The ownership of Gibraltar and its territorial waters is disputed by Spain. Similarly, Morocco disputes Spanish sovereignty over Ceuta on the southern coast. There are several islets, such as the disputed Isla Perejil, that are claimed by both Morocco and Spain.

Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, vessels passing through the strait do so under the regime of transit passage, rather than the more limited innocent passage allowed in most territorial waters. Therefore, a vessel or aircraft has the freedom of navigation or overflight for the purpose of crossing the strait of Gibraltar.

==Power generation==
Some studies have proposed the possibility of erecting tidal power generating stations within the Strait, to be powered from the predictable current at the Strait.

In the 1920s and 1930s, the Atlantropa project proposed damming the Strait to generate large amounts of electricity and lower the sea level of the Mediterranean by several hundreds of meters to create large new lands for settlement. This proposal would however have devastating effects on the local climate and ecology and would dramatically change the strength of the West African Monsoon.

== History of Strait crossings ==
Some adventurers crossed the Strait of Gibraltar by swimming, powered paragliding and Paddleboarding. 

=== By swimming ===

Mercedes Gleitze was the first known person to swim across the Strait of Gibraltar on 6 April 1928. It took her 12 hours and 50 minutes to cross the stretch of water. This was her sixth attempt to swim the Strait of Gibraltar, her first having been made in December 1927.
=== By powered paraglider ===

Francesco Stipo was the first known person to cross the Strait of Gibraltar with a powered paraglider on 11 July 1995.
According to Spanish newspaper Europa Sur, Stipo crossed the Strait from Tarifa to Ceuta in less than one hour, followed by the Red Cross boat &quot;Salvamar Tarifa&quot;, and landed on a street near the Port of Ceuta. 

=== By stand up paddleboard ===

Chris Ziaja and Nik Benner were the first known people to cross the Strait of Gibraltar with a stand up paddleboard on 4 October 2010. They set out from Punta Carnero and reached Ceuta four and a half hours later.

<text>Social epistemology refers to a broad set of approaches that can be taken in epistemology (the study of knowledge) that construes human knowledge as a collective achievement. Another way of characterizing social epistemology is as the evaluation of the social dimensions of knowledge or information. 

As a field of inquiry in analytic philosophy, social epistemology deals with questions about knowledge in social contexts, meaning those in which knowledge attributions cannot be explained by examining individuals in isolation from one another. The most common topics discussed in contemporary social epistemology are testimony (e.g. &quot;When does a belief that x is true which resulted from being told &#x27;x is true&#x27; constitute knowledge?&quot;), peer disagreement (e.g. &quot;When and how should I revise my beliefs in light of other people holding beliefs that contradict mine?&quot;), and group epistemology (e.g. &quot;What does it mean to attribute knowledge to groups rather than individuals, and when are such knowledge attributions appropriate?&quot;). Social epistemology also examines the social justification of belief.

One of the enduring difficulties with defining &quot;social epistemology&quot; that arises is the attempt to determine what the word &quot;knowledge&quot; means in this context. There is also a challenge in arriving at a definition of &quot;social&quot; which satisfies academics from different disciplines. Social epistemologists may exist working in many of the disciplines of the humanities and social sciences, most commonly in philosophy and sociology. In addition to marking a distinct movement in traditional and analytic epistemology, social epistemology is associated with the interdisciplinary field of science and technology studies (STS).

== History of the term ==
The consideration of social dimensions of knowledge in relation to philosophy started in 380 B.C.E with Plato’s dialogue: &quot;Charmides&quot;. This dialogue included Socrates&#x27; argument about whether anyone is capable of examining if another man&#x27;s claim that he knows something, is true or not. In it he questions the degree of certainty an unprofessional in a field can have towards a person’s claim to be a specialist in that same field. Charmides also explored the tendency of the utopian vision of social relations to degenerate into dystopian fantasy. As the exploration of a dependence on authoritative figures constitutes a part of the study of social epistemology, it confirms the existence of the ideology in minds long before it was given its label. 

In 1936, Karl Mannheim turned Karl Marx‘s theory of ideology (which interpreted the “social” aspect in epistemology to be of a political or sociological nature) into an analysis of how the human society develops and functions in this respect. Particularly, this Marxist analysis prompted Mannheim to write Ideology and Utopia, which investigated the classical sociology of knowledge and the construct of ideology. 

The term “social epistemology” was first coined by the library scientists Margaret Egan. and Jesse Shera in a Library Quarterly paper at the University of Chicago Graduate Library School in the 1950s. The term was used by Robert K. Merton in a 1972 article in the American Journal of Sociology and then by Steven Shapin in 1979. However, it was not until the 1980s that the current sense of “social epistemology” began to emerge. 

=== The rise of social epistemology ===
In the 1980s, there was a powerful growth of interest amongst philosophers in topics such as epistemic value of testimony, the nature and function of expertise, proper distribution of cognitive labor and resources among individuals in the communities and the status of group reasoning and knowledge.

In 1987, the philosophical journal &quot;Synthese&quot; published a special issue on social epistemology which included two authors that have since taken the branch of epistemology in two divergent directions: Alvin Goldman and Steve Fuller. Fuller founded a journal called &quot;Social Epistemology: A journal of knowledge, culture, and policy&quot; in 1987 and published his first book, &quot;Social Epistemology&quot;, in 1988. Goldman’s &quot;Knowledge in a Social World&quot; came out in 1999. Goldman advocates for a type of epistemology which is sometimes called “veritistic epistemology” because of its large emphasis on truth. This type of epistemology is sometimes seen to side with “essentialism” as opposed to “multiculturalism”. But Goldman has argued that this association between veritistic epistemology and essentialism is not necessary. He describes Social Epistemology as knowledge derived from one’s interactions with another person, group or society. 

Goldman looks into one of the two strategies of the socialization of epistemology. This strategy includes the evaluation of social factors that impact knowledge formed on true belief. In contrast, Fuller takes preference for the second strategy that defines knowledge influenced by social factors as collectively accepted belief. The difference between the two can be simplified with exemplars e.g.: the first strategy means analyzing how your degree of wealth (a social factor) influences what information you determine to be valid whilst the second strategy occurs when an evaluation is done on wealth’s influence upon your knowledge acquired from the beliefs of the society in which you find yourself.

Fuller&#x27;s position supports the conceptualization that social epistemology is a critique of context, particularly in his approach to &quot;knowledge society&quot; and the &quot;university&quot; as integral contexts of modern learning. It is said that this articulated a reformulation of the Duheim-Quine thesis, which covers the underdetermination of theory by data. It explains that the problem of context will assume this form: :knowledge is determined by its context&quot;. In 2012, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of &quot;Social Epistemology&quot;, Fuller reflected upon the history and the prospects of the field, including the need for social epistemology to re-connect with the larger issues of knowledge production first identified by Charles Sanders Peirce as ‘’cognitive economy’’ and nowadays often pursued by library and information science. As for the “analytic social epistemology”, to which Goldman has been a significant contributor, Fuller concludes that it has “failed to make significant progress owing, in part, to a minimal understanding of actual knowledge practices, a minimised role for philosophers in ongoing inquiry, and a focus on maintaining the status quo of epistemology as a field.”

=== Kuhn, Foucault, and the sociology of scientific knowledge ===
The basic view of knowledge that motivated the emergence of social epistemology as it is perceived today can be traced to the work of Thomas Kuhn and Michel Foucault, which gained acknowledgment at the end of the 1960s. Both brought historical concerns directly to bear on problems long associated with the philosophy of science. Perhaps the most notable issue here was the nature of truth, which both Kuhn and Foucault described as a relative and contingent notion. On this background, ongoing work in the sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) and the history and philosophy of science (HPS) was able to assert its epistemological consequences, leading most notably to the establishment of the strong programme at the University of Edinburgh. In terms of the two strands of social epistemology, Fuller is more sensitive and receptive to this historical trajectory (if not always in agreement) than Goldman, whose “veritistic” social epistemology can be reasonably read as a systematic rejection of the more extreme claims associated with Kuhn and Foucault.

== Social epistemology as a field ==
In the standard sense of the term today, social epistemology is a field within analytic philosophy. It focuses on the social aspects of how knowledge is created and disseminated. What precisely these social aspects are, and whether they have beneficial or detrimental effects upon the possibilities to create, acquire and spread knowledge is a subject of continuous debate. The most common topics discussed in contemporary social epistemology are testimony (e.g. &quot;When does a belief that &#x27;x is true&#x27; which resulted from being told that &#x27;x is true&#x27; constitute knowledge?&quot;), peer disagreement (e.g. &quot;When and how should I revise my beliefs in light of other people holding beliefs that contradict mine?&quot;), and group epistemology (e.g. &quot;What does it mean to attribute knowledge to groups rather than individuals, and when are such knowledge attributions appropriate?&quot;).

Within the field, &quot;the social&quot; is approached in two complementary and not mutually exclusive ways: &quot;the social&quot; character of knowledge can either be approached through inquiries in &quot;inter-individual&quot; epistemic relations or through inquiries focusing on epistemic &quot;communities&quot;. The inter-individual approach typically focuses on issues such as testimony, epistemic trust as a form of trust placed by one individual in another, epistemic dependence, epistemic authority, etc. The community approach typically focuses on issues such as community standards of justification, community procedures of critique, diversity, epistemic justice, and collective knowledge.

Social epistemology as a field within analytic philosophy has close ties to, and often overlaps with philosophy of science. While parts of the field engage in abstract, normative considerations of knowledge creation and dissemination, other parts of the field are &quot;naturalized epistemology&quot; in the sense that they draw on empirically gained insights---which could mean natural science research from, e.g., cognitive psychology, be that qualitative or quantitative social science research. (For the notion of &quot;naturalized epistemology&quot; see Willard Van Orman Quine.) And while parts of the field are concerned with analytic considerations of rather general character, case-based and domain-specific inquiries in, e.g., knowledge creation in collaborative scientific practice, knowledge exchange on online platforms or knowledge gained in learning institutions play an increasing role.

Important academic journals for social epistemology as a field within analytic philosophy are, e.g., &quot;Episteme&quot;, &quot;Social Epistemology&quot;, and &quot;Synthese&quot;. However, major works within this field are also published in journals that predominantly address philosophers of science and psychology or in interdisciplinary journals which focus on particular domains of inquiry (such as, e.g., &quot;Ethics and Information Technology&quot;).

== Major philosophers who influenced social epistemology ==
# Plato in his dialogue &quot;Charmides&quot;
# John Locke in Problem of Testimony
# David Hume in Problem of Testimony
# Thomas Reid in Problem of Testimony
# Karl Marx in interrelating Ideology and Knowledge.
#* used by Karl Mannheim who concentrated on the social conditioning of knowledge with the reasoning that a knowledge claim&#x27;s validity is restricted by the social conditions with regard to which the claim was initially made.
# Miranda Fricker in Problem of Testimony

==Present and future concerns==

In both stages, both varieties of social epistemology remain largely &quot;academic&quot; or &quot;theoretical&quot; projects. Yet both emphasize the social significance of knowledge and therefore the cultural value of social epistemology itself. A range of journals publishing social epistemology welcome papers that include a policy dimension. 

More practical applications of social epistemology can be found in the areas of library science, academic publishing, guidelines for scientific authorship and collaboration, knowledge policy and debates over the role of the Internet in knowledge transmission and creation.

Social epistemology is still considered a relatively new addition to philosophy, with its problems and theories still fresh and in rapid movement. Of increasing importance is social epistemology developments within transdisciplinarity as manifested by media ecology.

<doc id="28184" wikidata="Q4343" url="?curid=28184" title="Sound card">
<text>A sound card (also known as an audio card) is an internal expansion card that provides input and output of audio signals to and from a computer under the control of computer programs. The term &quot;sound card&quot; is also applied to external audio interfaces used for professional audio applications.

Sound functionality can also be integrated into the motherboard, using components similar to those found on plug-in cards. The integrated sound system is often still referred to as a &quot;sound card&quot;. Sound processing hardware is also present on modern video cards with HDMI to output sound along with the video using that connector; previously they used a S/PDIF connection to the motherboard or sound card.

Typical uses of sound cards or sound card functionality include providing the audio component for multimedia applications such as music composition, editing video or audio, presentation, education and entertainment (games) and video projection. Sound cards are also used for computer-based communication such as voice over IP and teleconferencing.

==General characteristics==
Sound cards use a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), which converts recorded or generated digital signal data into an analog format. The output signal is connected to an amplifier, headphones, or external device using standard interconnects, such as a TRS phone connector.

A common external connector is the microphone connector. Input through a microphone connector can be used, for example, by speech recognition or voice over IP applications. Most sound cards have a line in connector for an analog input from a sound source that has higher voltage levels than a microphone. In either case, the sound card uses an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to digitize this signal.

Some cards include a sound chip to support the production of synthesized sounds, usually for real-time generation of music and sound effects using minimal data and CPU time.

The card may use direct memory access to transfer the samples to and from main memory, from where a recording and playback software may read and write it to the hard disk for storage, editing, or further processing.

===Sound channels and polyphony===
An important sound card characteristic is polyphony, which refers to its ability to process and output multiple independent voices or sounds simultaneously. These distinct channels are seen as the number of audio outputs, which may correspond to a speaker configuration such as 2.0 (stereo), 2.1 (stereo and sub woofer), 5.1 (surround), or other configurations. Sometimes, the terms &quot;voice&quot; and &quot;channel&quot; are used interchangeably to indicate the degree of polyphony, not the output speaker configuration. For example, much older sound chips could accommodate three voices, but only one output audio channel (i.e., a single mono output), requiring all voices to be mixed together. Later cards, such as the AdLib sound card, had a 9-voice polyphony combined in 1 mono output channel.

Early PC sound cards had multiple FM synthesis voices (typically 9 or 16) which were used for MIDI music. The full capabilities of advanced cards are often not fully used; only one (mono) or two (stereo) voice(s) and channel(s) are usually dedicated to playback of digital sound samples, and playing back more than one digital sound sample usually requires a software downmix at a fixed sampling rate. Modern low-cost integrated sound cards (i.e., those built into motherboards) such as audio codecs like those meeting the AC&#x27;97 standard and even some lower-cost expansion sound cards still work this way. These devices may provide more than two sound output channels (typically 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound), but they usually have no actual hardware polyphony for either sound effects or MIDI reproduction these tasks are performed entirely in software. This is similar to the way inexpensive softmodems perform modem tasks in software rather than in hardware.

In the early days of wavetable synthesis, some sound card manufacturers advertised polyphony solely on the MIDI capabilities alone. In this case, typically, the card is only capable of two channels of digital sound and the polyphony specification solely applies to the number of MIDI instruments the sound card is capable of producing at once.

Modern sound cards may provide more flexible &quot;audio accelerator&quot; capabilities which can be used in support of higher levels of polyphony or other purposes such as hardware acceleration of 3D sound, positional audio and real-time DSP effects.

Connectors on the sound cards are color-coded as per the PC System Design Guide. They may also have symbols of arrows, holes and soundwaves that are associated with each jack position.

==History of sound cards for the IBM PC architecture==


Sound cards for IBM PC–compatible computers were very uncommon until 1988. For the majority IBM PC users, the internal PC speaker was the only way for early PC software to produce sound and music. The speaker hardware was typically limited to square waves. The resulting sound was generally described as &quot;beeps and boops&quot; which resulted in the common nickname &quot;beeper&quot;. Several companies, most notably Access Software, developed techniques for digital sound reproduction over the PC speaker like RealSound. The resulting audio, while functional, suffered from the heavily distorted output and low volume, and usually required all other processing to be stopped while sounds were played. Other home computers of the 1980s like the Commodore 64 included hardware support for digital sound playback or music synthesis, leaving the IBM PC at a disadvantage when it came to multimedia applications. Early sound cards for the IBM PC platform were not designed for gaming or multimedia applications, but rather on specific audio applications, such as music composition with the AdLib Personal Music System, IBM Music Feature Card, and Creative Music System, or on speech synthesis like Digispeech &quot;DS201&quot;, Covox Speech Thing, and Street Electronics &quot;Echo&quot;.

In 1988, a panel of computer-game CEOs stated at the Consumer Electronics Show that the PC&#x27;s limited sound capability prevented it from becoming the leading home computer, that it needed a $49–79 sound card with better capability than current products, and that once such hardware was widely installed, their companies would support it. Sierra On-Line, which had pioneered supporting EGA and VGA video, and 3-1/2&quot; disks, promised that year to support the AdLib, IBM Music Feature, and Roland MT-32 sound cards in its games. A 1989 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; survey found that 18 of 25 game companies planned to support AdLib, six Roland and Covox, and seven Creative Music System/Game Blaster.

===Hardware manufacturers===
One of the first manufacturers of sound cards for the IBM PC was AdLib, which produced a card based on the Yamaha YM3812 sound chip, also known as the OPL2. The AdLib had two modes: A 9-voice mode where each voice could be fully programmed, and a less frequently used &quot;percussion&quot; mode with 3 regular voices producing 5 independent percussion-only voices for a total of 11.

Creative Labs also marketed a sound card called the Creative Music System (C/MS) at about the same time. Although the C/MS had twelve voices to AdLib&#x27;s nine and was a stereo card while the AdLib was mono, the basic technology behind it was based on the Philips SAA1099 chip which was essentially a square-wave generator. It sounded much like twelve simultaneous PC speakers would have except for each channel having amplitude control, and failed to sell well, even after Creative renamed it the Game Blaster a year later, and marketed it through RadioShack in the US. The Game Blaster retailed for under $100 and was compatible with many popular games, such as Silpheed.

A large change in the IBM PC-compatible sound card market happened when Creative Labs introduced the Sound Blaster card. Recommended by Microsoft to developers creating software based on the Multimedia PC standard, the Sound Blaster cloned the AdLib and added a sound coprocessor for recording and playback of digital audio. The card also included a game port for adding a joystick, and the capability to interface to MIDI equipment using the game port and a special cable. With AdLib compatibility and more features at nearly the same price, most buyers chose the Sound Blaster. It eventually outsold the AdLib and dominated the market.

Roland also made sound cards in the late 1980s such as the MT-32 and LAPC-I. Roland cards sold for hundreds of dollars. Many games, such as Silpheed and Police Quest II, had music written for their cards. The cards were often poor at sound effects such as laughs, but for music were by far the best sound cards available until the mid-nineties. Some Roland cards, such as the SCC, and later versions of the MT-32 were made to be less expensive.

By 1992, one sound card vendor advertised that its product was &quot;Sound Blaster, AdLib, Disney Sound Source and Covox Speech Thing Compatible!&quot; Responding to readers complaining about an article on sound cards that unfavorably mentioned the Gravis Ultrasound, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; stated in January 1994 that, &quot;The de facto standard in the gaming world is Sound Blaster compatibility ... It would have been unfair to have recommended anything else.&quot; The magazine that year stated that &quot;Wing Commander II&quot; was &quot;Probably the game responsible&quot; for making it the standard card. The Sound Blaster line of cards, together with the first inexpensive CD-ROM drives and evolving video technology, ushered in a new era of multimedia computer applications that could play back CD audio, add recorded dialogue to video games, or even reproduce full motion video (albeit at much lower resolutions and quality in early days). The widespread decision to support the Sound Blaster design in multimedia and entertainment titles meant that future sound cards such as Media Vision&#x27;s Pro Audio Spectrum and the Gravis Ultrasound had to be Sound Blaster compatible if they were to sell well. Until the early 2000s, when the AC&#x27;97 audio standard became more widespread and eventually usurped the SoundBlaster as a standard due to its low cost and integration into many motherboards, Sound Blaster compatibility was a standard that many other sound cards supported to maintain compatibility with many games and applications released.

===Industry adoption===
When game company Sierra On-Line opted to support add-on music hardware in addition to built-in hardware such as the PC speaker and built-in sound capabilities of the IBM PCjr and Tandy 1000, what could be done with sound and music on the IBM PC changed dramatically. Two of the companies Sierra partnered with were Roland and AdLib, opting to produce in-game music for King&#x27;s Quest 4 that supported the MT-32 and AdLib Music Synthesizer. The MT-32 had superior output quality, due in part to its method of sound synthesis as well as built-in reverb. Since it was the most sophisticated synthesizer they supported, Sierra chose to use most of the MT-32&#x27;s custom features and unconventional instrument patches, producing background sound effects (e.g., chirping birds, clopping horse hooves, etc.) before the Sound Blaster brought digital audio playback to the PC. Many game companies also supported the MT-32, but supported the Adlib card as an alternative because of the latter&#x27;s higher market base. The adoption of the MT-32 led the way for the creation of the MPU-401, Roland Sound Canvas and General MIDI standards as the most common means of playing in-game music until the mid-1990s.

===Feature evolution===

Early ISA bus sound cards were half-duplex, meaning they couldn&#x27;t record and play digitized sound simultaneously. Later, ISA cards like the SoundBlaster AWE series and Plug-and-play Soundblaster clones supported simultaneous recording and playback, but at the expense of using up two IRQ and DMA channels instead of one. Conventional PCI bus cards generally do not have these limitations and are mostly full-duplex.

Sound cards have evolved in terms of digital audio sampling rate (starting from 8-bit , to 32-bit, that the latest solutions support). Along the way, some cards started offering wavetable synthesis, which provides superior MIDI synthesis quality relative to the earlier Yamaha OPL based solutions, which uses FM-synthesis. Some higher-end cards (such as Sound Blaster AWE32, Sound Blaster AWE64 and Sound Blaster Live!) introduced their own RAM and processor for user-definable sound samples and MIDI instruments as well as to offload audio processing from the CPU. Later, the integrated audio (AC&#x27;97 and later HD Audio) prefer the use of a software MIDI synthesizer, for example, Microsoft GS Wavetable SW Synth in Microsoft Windows.

With some exceptions, for years, sound cards, most notably the Sound Blaster series and their compatibles, had only one or two channels of digital sound. Early games and MOD-players needing more channels than a card could support had to resort to mixing multiple channels in software. Even today, the tendency is still to mix multiple sound streams in software, except in products specifically intended for gamers or professional musicians.

====Crippling of features====

As of 2024, sound cards are not commonly programmed with the audio loopback systems commonly called &quot;stereo mix&quot;, &quot;wave out mix&quot;, &quot;mono mix&quot; or &quot;what u hear&quot;, which previously allowed users to digitally record output otherwise only accessible to speakers.

Lenovo and other manufacturers fail to implement the feature in hardware, while other manufacturers disable the driver from supporting it. In some cases, loopback can be reinstated with driver updates. Alternatively, software such as virtual audio cable applications can be purchased to enable the functionality. According to Microsoft, the functionality was hidden by default in Windows Vista to reduce user confusion, but is still available, as long as the underlying sound card drivers and hardware support it. 

Ultimately, the user can use the analog loophole and connect the line out directly to the line in on the sound card. However, in laptops, manufacturers have gradually moved from providing 3 separate jacks with TRS connectorsusually for line in, line out/headphone out and microphoneinto just a single combo jack with TRRS connector that combines inputs and outputs.

===Outputs===
The number of physical sound channels has also increased. The first sound card solutions were mono. Stereo sound was introduced in the early 1980s, and quadraphonic sound came in 1989. This was shortly followed by 5.1 channel audio. The latest sound cards support up to 8 audio channels for the 7.1 speaker setup.

A few early sound cards had sufficient power to drive unpowered speakers directlyfor example, two watts per channel. With the popularity of amplified speakers, sound cards no longer have a power stage, though in many cases they can adequately drive headphones.

===Professional sound cards===
Professional sound cards are sound cards optimized for high-fidelity, low-latency multichannel sound recording and playback. Their drivers usually follow the Audio Stream Input/Output protocol for use with professional sound engineering and music software.

Professional sound cards are usually described as &quot;audio interfaces&quot;, and sometimes have the form of external rack-mountable units using USB, FireWire, or an optical interface, to offer sufficient data rates. The emphasis in these products is, in general, on multiple input and output connectors, direct hardware support for multiple input and output sound channels, as well as higher sampling rates and fidelity as compared to the usual consumer sound card.

On the other hand, certain features of consumer sound cards such as support for 3D audio, hardware acceleration in video games, or real-time ambiance effects are secondary, nonexistent or even undesirable in professional audio interfaces.

The typical consumer-grade sound card is intended for generic home, office, and entertainment purposes with an emphasis on playback and casual use, rather than catering to the needs of audio professionals. In general, consumer-grade sound cards impose several restrictions and inconveniences that would be unacceptable to an audio professional. Consumer sound cards are also limited in the &quot;effective&quot; sampling rates and bit depths they can actually manage and have lower numbers of less flexible input channels. Professional studio recording use typically requires more than the two channels that consumer sound cards provide, and more accessible connectors, unlike the variable mixture of internal—and sometimes virtual—and external connectors found in consumer-grade sound cards.

==Sound devices other than expansion cards==

===Integrated sound hardware on PC motherboards===
In 1984, the first IBM PCjr had a rudimentary 3-voice sound synthesis chip (the SN76489) which was capable of generating three square-wave tones with variable amplitude, and a pseudo-white noise channel that could generate primitive percussion sounds. The Tandy 1000, initially a clone of the PCjr, duplicated this functionality, with the Tandy 1000 TL/SL/RL models adding digital sound recording and playback capabilities. Many games during the 1980s that supported the PCjr&#x27;s video standard (described as &quot;Tandy-compatible&quot;, &quot;Tandy graphics&quot;, or &quot;TGA&quot;) also supported PCjr/Tandy 1000 audio.

In the late 1990s, many computer manufacturers began to replace plug-in sound cards with an audio codec chip (a combined audio AD/DA-converter) integrated into the motherboard. Many of these used Intel&#x27;s AC&#x27;97 specification. Others used inexpensive ACR slot accessory cards.

From around 2001, many motherboards incorporated full-featured sound cards, usually in the form of a custom chipset, providing something akin to full Sound Blaster compatibility and relatively high-quality sound. However, these features were dropped when AC&#x27;97 was superseded by Intel&#x27;s HD Audio standard, which was released in 2004, again specified the use of a codec chip, and slowly gained acceptance. As of 2011, most motherboards have returned to using a codec chip, albeit an HD Audio compatible one, and the requirement for Sound Blaster compatibility relegated to history.

===Integrated sound on other platforms===
Many home computers have their own motherboard-integrated sound devices: Commodore 64, Amiga, PC-88, FM-7, FM Towns, Sharp X1, X68000, BBC Micro, Electron, Archimedes, Atari 8-bit computers, Atari ST, Atari Falcon, Amstrad CPC, later revisions of the ZX Spectrum, MSX, Mac, and Apple IIGS. Workstations from Sun, Silicon Graphics and NeXT do as well. In some cases, most notably in those of the Macintosh, IIGS, Amiga, C64, SGI Indigo, X68000, MSX, Falcon, Archimedes, FM-7 and FM Towns, they provide very advanced capabilities (as of the time of manufacture), in others they are only minimal capabilities. Some of these platforms have also had sound cards designed for their bus architectures that cannot be used in a standard PC.

Several Japanese computer platforms, including the MSX, X1, X68000, FM Towns and FM-7, have built-in FM synthesis sound from Yamaha by the mid-1980s. By 1989, the FM Towns computer platform featured built-in PCM sample-based sound and supported the CD-ROM format.

The custom sound chip on Amiga, named Paula, has four digital sound channels (2 for the left speaker and 2 for the right) with 8-bit resolution for each channel and a 6-bit volume control per channel. Sound playback on Amiga was done by reading directly from the chip RAM without using the main CPU.

Most arcade video games have integrated sound chips. In the 1980s it was common to have a separate microprocessor for handling communication with the sound chip.

===Sound cards on other platforms===

The earliest known sound card used by computers was the Gooch Synthetic Woodwind, a music device for PLATO terminals, and is widely hailed as the precursor to sound cards and MIDI. It was invented in 1972.

Certain early arcade machines made use of sound cards to achieve playback of complex audio waveforms and digital music, despite being already equipped with onboard audio. An example of a sound card used in arcade machines is the Digital Compression System card, used in games from Midway. For example, &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; on the Midway T-Unit hardware. The T-Unit hardware already has an onboard YM2151 OPL chip coupled with an OKI 6295 DAC, but said game uses an added-on DCS card instead. The card is also used in the arcade version of Midway and Aerosmith&#x27;s Revolution X for complex looping music and speech playback.

MSX computers, while equipped with built-in sound capabilities, also relied on sound cards to produce better-quality audio. The card, known as Moonsound, uses a Yamaha OPL4 sound chip. Prior to the Moonsound, there were also sound cards called &quot;MSX Music&quot; and &quot;MSX Audio&quot; for the system, which uses OPL2 and OPL3 chipsets.

The Apple II computers, which did not have sound capabilities beyond rapidly clicking a speaker until the IIGS, could use plug-in sound cards from a variety of manufacturers. The first, in 1978, was ALF&#x27;s Apple Music Synthesizer, with 3 voices; two or three cards could be used to create 6 or 9 voices in stereo. Later ALF created the Apple Music II, a 9-voice model. The most widely supported card, however, was the Mockingboard. Sweet Micro Systems sold the Mockingboard in various models. Early Mockingboard models ranged from 3 voices in mono, while some later designs had 6 voices in stereo. Some software supported use of two Mockingboard cards, which allowed 12-voice music and sound. A 12-voice, single-card clone of the Mockingboard called the Phasor was made by Applied Engineering.

The ZX Spectrum that initially only had a beeper had some sound cards made for it. Examples include TurboSound Other examples are the Fuller Box, and Zon X-81.

The Commodore 64, while having an integrated SID (Sound Interface Device) chip, also had sound cards made for it. For example, the Sound Expander, which added on an OPL FM synthesizer.

The PC-98 series of computers, like their IBM PC cousins, also do not have integrated sound contrary to popular belief, and their default configuration is a PC speaker driven by a timer. Sound cards were made for the C-Bus expansion slots that these computers had, most of which used Yamaha&#x27;s FM and PSG chips and made by NEC themselves, although aftermarket clones can also be purchased, and Creative did release a C-Bus version of the SoundBlaster line of sound cards for the platform.

===External sound devices===
Devices such as the Covox Speech Thing could be attached to the parallel port of an IBM PC and fed 6- or 8-bit PCM sample data to produce audio. Also, many types of professional sound cards take the form of an external FireWire or USB unit, usually for convenience and improved fidelity.

Sound cards using the PC Card interface were available before laptop and notebook computers routinely had onboard sound. Most of these units were designed for mobile DJs, providing separate outputs to allow both playback and monitoring from one system, however, some also target mobile gamers.

====USB sound cards====

USB sound &quot;cards&quot; are external devices that plug into the computer via USB. They are often used in studios and on stage by electronic musicians including live PA performers and DJs. DJs who use DJ software typically use sound cards integrated into DJ controllers or specialized DJ sound cards. DJ sound cards sometimes have inputs with phono preamplifiers to allow turntables to be connected to the computer to control the software&#x27;s playback of music files with vinyl emulation.

The USB specification defines a standard interface, the USB audio device class, allowing a single driver to work with the various USB sound devices and interfaces on the market. Mac OS X, Windows, and Linux support this standard. However, some USB sound cards do not conform to the standard and require proprietary drivers from the manufacturer.

Cards meeting the older USB 1.1 specification are capable of high-quality sound with a limited number of channels, but USB 2.0 or later is more capable with their higher bandwidths.

==Uses==
The main function of a sound card is to play audio, usually music, with varying formats (monophonic, stereophonic, various multiple speaker setups) and degrees of control. The source may be a CD or DVD, a file, streamed audio, or any external source connected to a sound card input. Audio may be recorded. Sometimes sound card hardware and drivers do not support recording a source that is being played.

=== Non-sound uses ===
Sound cards can be used to generate (output) arbitrary electrical waveforms, as any digital waveform &quot;played&quot; by the soundcard is converted to the desired output within the bounds of its capabilities. In other words, sound cards are consumer-grade arbitrary waveform generators. A number of free and commercial software allow sound cards to act like function generators by generating desired waveforms from functions; there are also online services that generate audio files for any desired waveforms, playable through a sound card.

Sound cards can also be used to record electrical waveforms, in the same way it records an analog audio input. The recording can be displayed by special or general-purpose audio-editing software (acting as an oscilloscope) or further transformed and analyzed. A protection circuit should be used to keep the input voltage within acceptable bounds.

As general-purpose waveform generators and analyzers, sound cards are bound by several design and physical limitations.
* Sound cards have a limited sample rate, typically up to 192 kHz. Under the assumptions of the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem, this means a maximum signal frequency (bandwidth) of half that: 96 kHz. Real sound cards tend to have a bandwidth smaller than implied by the Nyquist limit from internal filtering.
* As with all ADCs and DACs, sound cards produce distortion and noise. A typical integrated sound card, the Realtek ALC887, according to its data sheet has distortion about 80 dB below the fundamental; cards are available with distortion better than −100 dB.
* Sound cards commonly suffer from some clock drift, requiring correction of measurement results.

Sound cards have been used to analyze and generate the following types of signals:

* Sound equipment testing. A very-low-distortion sinewave oscillator can be used as input to equipment under test; the output is sent to a sound card&#x27;s line input and run through Fourier transform software to find the amplitude of each harmonic of the added distortion. Alternatively, a less pure signal source may be used, with circuitry to subtract the input from the output, attenuated and phase-corrected; the result is distortion and noise only, which can be analyzed.
* Gamma spectroscopy. A sound card can serve as a cheap multichannel analyzer for gamma spectroscopy, which allows one to distinguish different radioactive isotopes.
* Longwave radio. A 192 KHz sound card can be used to receive radio signals up to 96 kHz. This bandwidth is enough for longwave time signals such as the DCF77 (77.5 KHz). A coil is attached to the input side as an antenna, while special software decodes the signal. A sound card can also work in the opposite direction and generate low power time signal transmissions (JJY at 40 KHz, using harmonics).

==Driver architecture==
To use a sound card, the operating system (OS) typically requires a specific device driver, a low-level program that handles the data connections between the physical hardware and the operating system. Some operating systems include the drivers for many cards; for cards not so supported, drivers are supplied with the card, or available for download.

* DOS programs for the IBM PC often had to use universal middleware driver libraries (such as the HMI Sound Operating System, the Miles Audio Interface Libraries (AIL), the Miles Sound System etc.) which had drivers for most common sound cards, since DOS itself had no real concept of a sound card. Some card manufacturers provided terminate-and-stay-resident drivers for their products. Often the driver is a Sound Blaster and AdLib emulator designed to allow their products to emulate a Sound Blaster and AdLib, and to allow games that could only use SoundBlaster or AdLib sound to work with the card. Finally, some programs simply had driver or middleware source code incorporated into the program itself for the sound cards that were supported.
* Microsoft Windows uses drivers generally written by the sound card manufacturers. Many device manufacturers supply the drivers on their own discs or to Microsoft for inclusion on Windows installation disc. USB audio device class support is present from Windows 98 onwards. Since Microsoft&#x27;s Universal Audio Architecture (UAA) initiative which supports HD Audio, FireWire and USB audio device class standards, a universal class driver by Microsoft can be used. The driver is included with Windows Vista. For Windows XP, Windows 2000 or Windows Server 2003, the driver can be obtained by contacting Microsoft support. Almost all manufacturer-supplied drivers for such devices also include this universal class driver.
* A number of versions of UNIX make use of the portable Open Sound System (OSS). Drivers are seldom produced by the card manufacturer.
* Most present-day Linux distributions make use of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA).
* Mockingboard support on the Apple II is usually incorporated into the programs itself as many programs for the Apple II boot directly from disk. However a TSR is shipped on a disk that adds instructions to Apple Basic so users can create programs that use the card, provided that the TSR is loaded first.

<text>In group theory, the symmetry group of a geometric object is the group of all transformations under which the object is invariant, endowed with the group operation of composition. Such a transformation is an invertible mapping of the ambient space which takes the object to itself, and which preserves all the relevant structure of the object. A frequent notation for the symmetry group of an object &quot;X&quot; is &quot;G&quot; = Sym(&quot;X&quot;).

For an object in a metric space, its symmetries form a subgroup of the isometry group of the ambient space. This article mainly considers symmetry groups in Euclidean geometry, but the concept may also be studied for more general types of geometric structure.

==Introduction==
We consider the &quot;objects&quot; possessing symmetry to be geometric figures, images, and patterns, such as a wallpaper pattern. For symmetry of physical objects, one may also take their physical composition as part of the pattern. (A pattern may be specified formally as a scalar field, a function of position with values in a set of colors or substances; as a vector field; or as a more general function on the object.) The group of isometries of space induces a group action on objects in it, and the symmetry group Sym(&quot;X&quot;) consists of those isometries which map &quot;X&quot; to itself (as well as mapping any further pattern to itself). We say &quot;X&quot; is &quot;invariant&quot; under such a mapping, and the mapping is a &quot;symmetry&quot; of &quot;X&quot;.

The above is sometimes called the full symmetry group of &quot;X&quot; to emphasize that it includes orientation-reversing isometries (reflections, glide reflections and improper rotations), as long as those isometries map this particular &quot;X&quot; to itself. The subgroup of orientation-preserving symmetries (translations, rotations, and compositions of these) is called its proper symmetry group. An object is chiral when it has no orientation-reversing symmetries, so that its proper symmetry group is equal to its full symmetry group.

Any symmetry group whose elements have a common fixed point, which is true if the group is finite or the figure is bounded, can be represented as a subgroup of the orthogonal group O(&quot;n&quot;) by choosing the origin to be a fixed point. The proper symmetry group is then a subgroup of the special orthogonal group SO(&quot;n&quot;), and is called the rotation group of the figure.

In a discrete symmetry group, the points symmetric to a given point do not accumulate toward a limit point. That is, every orbit of the group (the images of a given point under all group elements) forms a discrete set. All finite symmetry groups are discrete.

Discrete symmetry groups come in three types: (1) finite point groups, which include only rotations, reflections, inversions and rotoinversions – i.e., the finite subgroups of O(&quot;n&quot;); (2) infinite lattice groups, which include only translations; and (3) infinite space groups containing elements of both previous types, and perhaps also extra transformations like screw displacements and glide reflections. There are also continuous symmetry groups (Lie groups), which contain rotations of arbitrarily small angles or translations of arbitrarily small distances. An example is O(3), the symmetry group of a sphere. Symmetry groups of Euclidean objects may be completely classified as the subgroups of the Euclidean group E(&quot;n&quot;) (the isometry group of R&quot;n&quot;).

Two geometric figures have the same &quot;symmetry type&quot; when their symmetry groups are &quot;conjugate&quot; subgroups of the Euclidean group: that is, when the subgroups &quot;H&quot;1, &quot;H&quot;2 are related by for some &quot;g&quot; in E(&quot;n&quot;). For example:

*two 3D figures have mirror symmetry, but with respect to different mirror planes.
*two 3D figures have 3-fold rotational symmetry, but with respect to different axes.
*two 2D patterns have translational symmetry, each in one direction; the two translation vectors have the same length but a different direction.

In the following sections, we only consider isometry groups whose orbits are topologically closed, including all discrete and continuous isometry groups. However, this excludes for example the 1D group of translations by a rational number; such a non-closed figure cannot be drawn with reasonable accuracy due to its arbitrarily fine detail.

==One dimension==

The isometry groups in one dimension are:

*the trivial cyclic group C1
*the groups of two elements generated by a reflection; they are isomorphic with C2
*the infinite discrete groups generated by a translation; they are isomorphic with Z, the additive group of the integers
*the infinite discrete groups generated by a translation and a reflection; they are isomorphic with the generalized dihedral group of Z, Dih(Z), also denoted by D∞ (which is a semidirect product of Z and C2).
*the group generated by all translations (isomorphic with the additive group of the real numbers R); this group cannot be the symmetry group of a Euclidean figure, even endowed with a pattern: such a pattern would be homogeneous, hence could also be reflected. However, a constant one-dimensional vector field has this symmetry group.
*the group generated by all translations and reflections in points; they are isomorphic with the generalized dihedral group Dih(R).

==Two dimensions==
Up to conjugacy the discrete point groups in two-dimensional space are the following classes:

*cyclic groups C1, C2, C3, C4, ... where C&quot;n&quot; consists of all rotations about a fixed point by multiples of the angle 360°/&quot;n&quot;
*dihedral groups D1, D2, D3, D4, ..., where D&quot;n&quot; (of order 2&quot;n&quot;) consists of the rotations in C&quot;n&quot; together with reflections in &quot;n&quot; axes that pass through the fixed point.

C1 is the trivial group containing only the identity operation, which occurs when the figure is asymmetric, for example the letter &quot;F&quot;. C2 is the symmetry group of the letter &quot;Z&quot;, C3 that of a triskelion, C4 of a swastika, and C5, C6, etc. are the symmetry groups of similar swastika-like figures with five, six, etc. arms instead of four.

D1 is the 2-element group containing the identity operation and a single reflection, which occurs when the figure has only a single axis of bilateral symmetry, for example the letter &quot;A&quot;.

D2, which is isomorphic to the Klein four-group, is the symmetry group of a non-equilateral rectangle. This figure has four symmetry operations: the identity operation, one twofold axis of rotation, and two nonequivalent mirror planes.

D3, D4 etc. are the symmetry groups of the regular polygons.

Within each of these symmetry types, there are two degrees of freedom for the center of rotation, and in the case of the dihedral groups, one more for the positions of the mirrors.

The remaining isometry groups in two dimensions with a fixed point are:
*the special orthogonal group SO(2) consisting of all rotations about a fixed point; it is also called the circle group S1, the multiplicative group of complex numbers of absolute value 1. It is the &quot;proper&quot; symmetry group of a circle and the continuous equivalent of C&quot;n&quot;. There is no geometric figure that has as &quot;full&quot; symmetry group the circle group, but for a vector field it may apply (see the three-dimensional case below). 
*the orthogonal group O(2) consisting of all rotations about a fixed point and reflections in any axis through that fixed point. This is the symmetry group of a circle. It is also called Dih(S1) as it is the generalized dihedral group of S1.

Non-bounded figures may have isometry groups including translations; these are:
*the 7 frieze groups 
*the 17 wallpaper groups
*for each of the symmetry groups in one dimension, the combination of all symmetries in that group in one direction, and the group of all translations in the perpendicular direction
*ditto with also reflections in a line in the first direction.

==Three dimensions==

Up to conjugacy the set of three-dimensional point groups consists of 7 infinite series, and 7 other individual groups. In crystallography, only those point groups are considered which preserve some crystal lattice (so their rotations may only have order 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6). This crystallographic restriction of the infinite families of general point groups results in 32 crystallographic point groups (27 individual groups from the 7 series, and 5 of the 7 other individuals).

The continuous symmetry groups with a fixed point include those of:
*cylindrical symmetry without a symmetry plane perpendicular to the axis. This applies, for example, to a bottle or cone.
*cylindrical symmetry with a symmetry plane perpendicular to the axis
*spherical symmetry

For objects with scalar field patterns, the cylindrical symmetry implies vertical reflection symmetry as well. However, this is not true for vector field patterns: for example, in cylindrical coordinates with respect to some axis, the vector field 
formula_1 has cylindrical symmetry with respect to the axis whenever formula_2 and formula_3 have this symmetry (no dependence on formula_4); and it has reflectional symmetry only when formula_5.

For spherical symmetry, there is no such distinction: any patterned object has planes of reflection symmetry.

The continuous symmetry groups without a fixed point include those with a screw axis, such as an infinite helix. See also subgroups of the Euclidean group.

==Symmetry groups in general==

In wider contexts, a symmetry group may be any kind of transformation group, or automorphism group. Each type of mathematical structure has invertible mappings which preserve the structure. Conversely, specifying the symmetry group can define the structure, or at least clarify the meaning of geometric congruence or invariance; this is one way of looking at the Erlangen programme.

For example, objects in a hyperbolic non-Euclidean geometry have Fuchsian symmetry groups, which are the discrete subgroups of the isometry group of the hyperbolic plane, preserving hyperbolic rather than Euclidean distance. (Some are depicted in drawings of Escher.) Similarly, automorphism groups of finite geometries preserve families of point-sets (discrete subspaces) rather than Euclidean subspaces, distances, or inner products. Just as for Euclidean figures, objects in any geometric space have symmetry groups which are subgroups of the symmetries of the ambient space.

Another example of a symmetry group is that of a combinatorial graph: a graph symmetry is a permutation of the vertices which takes edges to edges. Any finitely presented group is the symmetry group of its Cayley graph; the free group is the symmetry group of an infinite tree graph.

==Group structure in terms of symmetries==
Cayley&#x27;s theorem states that any abstract group is a subgroup of the permutations of some set &quot;X&quot;, and so can be considered as the symmetry group of &quot;X&quot; with some extra structure. In addition, many abstract features of the group (defined purely in terms of the group operation) can be interpreted in terms of symmetries.

For example, let &quot;G&quot; = Sym(&quot;X&quot;) be the finite symmetry group of a figure &quot;X&quot; in a Euclidean space, and let &quot;H&quot; ⊂ &quot;G&quot; be a subgroup. Then &quot;H&quot; can be interpreted as the symmetry group of &quot;X&quot;+, a &quot;decorated&quot; version of &quot;X&quot;. Such a decoration may be constructed as follows. Add some patterns such as arrows or colors to &quot;X&quot; so as to break all symmetry, obtaining a figure &quot;X&quot;# with Sym(&quot;X&quot;#) = {1}, the trivial subgroup; that is, &quot;gX&quot;# ≠ &quot;X&quot;# for all non-trivial &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;. Now we get:
:formula_6

Normal subgroups may also be characterized in this framework. 
The symmetry group of the translation &quot;gX&quot; + is the conjugate subgroup &quot;gHg&quot;−1. Thus &quot;H&quot; is normal whenever:
:formula_7
that is, whenever the decoration of &quot;X&quot;+ may be drawn in any orientation, with respect to any side or feature of &quot;X&quot;, and still yield the same symmetry group &quot;gHg&quot;−1 = &quot;H&quot;.

As an example, consider the dihedral group &quot;G&quot; = &quot;D&quot;3 = Sym(&quot;X&quot;), where &quot;X&quot; is an equilateral triangle. We may decorate this with an arrow on one edge, obtaining an asymmetric figure &quot;X&quot;#. Letting τ ∈ &quot;G&quot; be the reflection of the arrowed edge, the composite figure &quot;X&quot;+ = &quot;X&quot;# ∪ τ&quot;X&quot;# has a bidirectional arrow on that edge, and its symmetry group is &quot;H&quot; = {1, τ}. This subgroup is not normal, since &quot;gX&quot;+ may have the bi-arrow on a different edge, giving a different reflection symmetry group.

However, letting H = {1, ρ, ρ2} ⊂ &quot;D&quot;3 be the cyclic subgroup generated by a rotation, the decorated figure &quot;X&quot;+ consists of a 3-cycle of arrows with consistent orientation. Then &quot;H&quot; is normal, since drawing such a cycle with either orientation yields the same symmetry group &quot;H&quot;.

<text>Singular &quot;they&quot;, along with its inflected or derivative forms, &quot;them&quot;, &quot;their&quot;, &quot;theirs&quot;, and &quot;themselves&quot; (also &quot;themself&quot; and &quot;theirself&quot;), is a gender-neutral third-person pronoun derived from plural they. It typically occurs with an indeterminate antecedent, to refer to an unknown person, or to refer to every person of some group, in sentences such as:



This use of singular &quot;they&quot; had emerged by the 14th century, about a century after the plural &quot;they&quot;. Singular &quot;they&quot; has been criticised since the mid-18th century by prescriptive commentators who consider it an error. Its continued use in modern standard English has become more common and formally accepted with the move toward gender-neutral language. Some early-21st-century style guides described it as colloquial and less appropriate in formal writing. However, by 2020, most style guides accepted the singular &quot;they&quot; as a personal pronoun.

In the early 21st century, use of singular &quot;they&quot; with known individuals emerged for non-binary people, as in, for example, &quot;This is my friend, &quot;Jay&quot;. I met &quot;them&quot; at work.&quot; &quot;They&quot; in this context was named &quot;Word of the Year&quot; for 2015 by the American Dialect Society, and for 2019 by Merriam-Webster. In 2020, the American Dialect Society also selected it as &quot;Word of the Decade&quot; for the 2010s.

==Inflected forms and derivative pronouns==
Like the &quot;singular &quot;you&quot;&quot;, &quot;singular &quot;they&quot;&quot; permits a singular antecedent, but is used with the same verb forms as plural &quot;they&quot;, and has the same inflected forms as plural &quot;they&quot; (i.e. &quot;them&quot;, &quot;their&quot;, and &quot;theirs&quot;), except that in the reflexive form, &quot;themself&quot; is sometimes used instead of &quot;themselves&quot;.

&quot;Themself&quot; is attested from the 14th to 16th centuries. Its use has been increasing since the 1970s or 1980s, though it is sometimes still classified as &quot;a minority form&quot;. In 2002, Payne and Huddleston, in &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot;, called its use in standard dialect &quot;rare and acceptable only to a minority of speakers&quot; but &quot;likely to increase with the growing acceptance of &quot;they&quot; as a singular pronoun&quot;. It is useful when referring to a single person of indeterminate gender, where the plural form &quot;themselves&quot; might seem incongruous, as in:

===Regional preferences===
The Canadian government recommends &quot;themselves&quot; as the reflexive form of singular &quot;they&quot; for use in Canadian federal legislative texts and advises against using &quot;themself&quot;.

==Usage==

&quot;They&quot; with a singular antecedent goes back to the Middle English of the 14th century (slightly younger than &quot;they&quot; with a plural antecedent, which was borrowed from Old Norse in the 13th century), and has remained in use for centuries in spite of its proscription by traditional grammarians beginning in the mid-18th century.

Informal spoken English exhibits universal use of the singular &quot;they&quot;. An examination by Jürgen Gerner of the British National Corpus published in 1998 found that British speakers, regardless of social status, age, sex, or region, used the singular &quot;they&quot; more often than the gender-neutral &quot;he&quot; or other options in the context of being anaphors after indefinite pronouns like &quot;everybody&quot; and &quot;anybody&quot;.

===Prescription of generic &quot;he&quot;===
&quot;He&quot; has been used with antecedents of indeterminate gender since the Old English period, as in the following:


The earliest known explicit recommendation by a grammarian to use the generic &quot;he&quot; rather than &quot;they&quot; in formal English is Ann Fisher&#x27;s mid-18th century &quot;A New Grammar&quot; assertion that &quot;The &quot;Masculine Person&quot; answers to the &quot;general Name&quot;, which comprehends both &quot;Male&quot; and &quot;Female&quot;; as, &quot;any Person who knows what he says.&quot;&quot; (Ann Fisher as quoted by Ostade)

Nineteenth-century grammarians insisted on &quot;he&quot; as a gender-neutral pronoun on the grounds of number agreement, while rejecting &quot;he or she&quot; as clumsy, and this was widely adopted: e.g. in 1850, the British Parliament passed an act which provided that, when used in acts of Parliament &quot;words importing the masculine gender shall be deemed and taken to include females&quot;. Baskervill and Sewell mention the common use of the singular &quot;they&quot; in their &quot;An English Grammar for the Use of High School, Academy and College Class&quot; of 1895, but prefer the generic &quot;he&quot; on the basis of number agreement.

Baskervill gives a number of examples of recognized authors using the singular &quot;they&quot;, including:


It has been argued that the real motivation for promoting the &quot;generic&quot; &quot;he&quot; was an androcentric world view, with the default sex of humans being male – and the default gender therefore being masculine. There is some evidence for this: Wilson wrote in 1560:

And Poole wrote in 1646:
In spite of continuous attempts on the part of educationalists to proscribe singular &quot;they&quot; in favour of &quot;he&quot;, this advice was ignored; even writers of the period continued to use &quot;they&quot; (though the proscription may have been observed more by American writers). Use of the purportedly gender-neutral &quot;he&quot; remained acceptable until at least the 1960s, though some uses of &quot;he&quot; were later criticized as being awkward or silly, for instance when referring to:
* Indeterminate persons of both sexes:

* Known persons of both sexes:
===Contemporary use of &quot;he&quot; to refer to a generic or indefinite antecedent===
&quot;He&quot; is still sometimes found in contemporary writing when referring to a generic or indeterminate antecedent. In some cases, it is clear from the situation that the persons potentially referred to are likely to be male, as in:
In some cases the antecedent may refer to persons who are only &quot;probably&quot; male or to occupations traditionally thought of as male:
In other situations, the antecedent may refer to an indeterminate person of either sex:
In 2010, Choy and Clark still recommend the use of generic &quot;he&quot; &quot;in formal speech or writing&quot;:

In informal spoken English, plural pronouns are often used with indefinite pronoun antecedents. However, this construction is generally not considered appropriate in formal speech or writing.

In 2015, &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot; calls this &quot;the now outmoded use of &quot;he&quot; to mean &#x27;anyone, stating:
In 2016, &quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern English&quot; calls the generic use of masculine pronouns &quot;the traditional view, now widely assailed as sexist&quot;.

===Rise of gender-neutral language===
The earliest known attempt to create a new gender-neutral pronoun in English dates back to 1792, when Scottish economist James Anderson advocated for an indeterminate pronoun &quot;ou&quot;.

In 1808, poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge suggested &quot;it&quot; and &quot;which&quot; as neutral pronouns for the word &quot;person&quot;:

In the second half of the 20th century, people expressed more widespread concern at the use of male-oriented language. This included criticism of the use of &quot;man&quot; as a generic term to include men and women and of the use of &quot;he&quot; to refer to any human, regardless of sex (social gender).

It was argued that &quot;he&quot; could not sensibly be used as a generic pronoun understood to include men and women. William Safire in his &quot;On Language&quot; column in &quot;The New York Times&quot; approved of the use of generic &quot;he&quot;, mentioning the mnemonic phrase &quot;the male embraces the female&quot;. C. Badendyck from Brooklyn wrote to the &quot;New York Times&quot; in a reply:

By 1980, the movement toward gender-neutral language had gained wide support, and many organizations, including most publishers, had issued guidelines on the use of gender-neutral language, but stopped short of recommending &quot;they&quot; to be third-person singular with a non-indeterminate, singular antecedent.

===Contemporary usage===
The use of masculine generic nouns and pronouns in written and spoken language has decreased since the 1970s.
In a corpus of spontaneous speech collected in Australia in the 1990s, singular &quot;they&quot; had become the most frequently used generic pronoun (rather than generic &quot;he&quot; or &quot;he or she&quot;). Similarly, a study from 2002 looking at a corpus of American and British newspapers showed a preference for &quot;they&quot; to be used as a singular epicene pronoun.

The increased use of singular &quot;they&quot; may owe in part to an increasing desire for gender-neutral language. A solution in formal writing has often been to write &quot;he or she&quot;, or something similar, but this is often considered awkward or overly politically correct, particularly when used excessively. In 2016, the journal &quot;American Speech&quot; published a study by Darren K. LaScotte investigating the pronouns used by native English speakers in informal written responses to questions concerning a subject of unspecified gender, finding that 68% of study participants chose singular &quot;they&quot; to refer to such an antecedent. Some participants noted that they found constructions such as &quot;he or she&quot; inadequate as they do not include people who identify as neither male nor female.

&quot;They&quot; in this context was named Word of the Year for 2019 by Merriam-Webster and for 2015 by the American Dialect Society. On January 4, 2020, the American Dialect Society announced they had crowned &quot;they&quot;, again in this context, Word of the Decade for the 2010s.

====Use with a pronoun antecedent====
The singular antecedent can be a pronoun such as &quot;someone&quot;, &quot;anybody&quot;, or &quot;everybody&quot;, or an interrogative pronoun such as &quot;who&quot;:
* With &quot;somebody&quot; or &quot;someone&quot;:

* With &quot;anybody&quot; or &quot;anyone&quot;:

* With &quot;nobody&quot; or &quot;no one&quot;:
* With an interrogative pronoun as antecedent:

* With &quot;everybody&quot;, &quot;everyone&quot;, etc.:
=====Notional plurality or pairwise relationships=====
Although the pronouns &quot;everybody&quot;, &quot;everyone&quot;, &quot;nobody&quot;, and &quot;no one&quot; are singular in form and are used with a singular verb, these pronouns have an &quot;implied plurality&quot; that is somewhat similar to the implied plurality of collective or group nouns such as &quot;crowd&quot; or &quot;team&quot;, and in some sentences where the antecedent is one of these &quot;implied plural&quot; pronouns, the word &quot;they&quot; cannot be replaced by generic &quot;he&quot;, suggesting a &quot;notional plural&quot; rather than a &quot;bound variable&quot; interpretation . This is in contrast to sentences that involve multiple pairwise relationships and singular &quot;they&quot;, such as:


There are examples where the antecedent pronoun (such as &quot;everyone&quot;) may refer to a collective, with no necessary implication of pairwise relationships. These are examples of plural &quot;they&quot;:

Which are apparent because they do not work with a generic &quot;he&quot; or &quot;he or she&quot;:

In addition, for these &quot;notional plural&quot; cases, it would not be appropriate to use &quot;themself&quot; instead of &quot;themselves&quot; as in:
====Use with a generic noun as antecedent====
The singular antecedent can also be a noun such as &quot;person&quot;, &quot;patient&quot;, or &quot;student&quot;:
* With a noun (e.g. person, student, patient) used generically (e.g. in the sense of any member of that class or a specific member unknown to the speaker or writer)
* With representatives of a class previously referred to in the singular

Even when referring to a class of persons of known sex, &quot;they&quot; is sometimes used:
&quot;They&quot; may also be used with antecedents of mixed genders:
Even for a definite known person of known sex, &quot;they&quot; may be used in order to ignore or conceal the sex.

The word &quot;themself&quot; is also sometimes used when the antecedent is known or believed to be a single person.
====Use for specific, known people, including non-binary people====
Known individuals may be referred to as &quot;they&quot; if the individual&#x27;s gender is unknown to the speaker.

A known individual may also be referred to as &quot;they&quot; if the individual is non-binary or genderqueer and considers &quot;they&quot; and derivatives as appropriate pronouns. Several social media applications permit account holders to choose to identify their gender using one of a variety of non-binary or genderqueer options, such as &quot;genderfluid&quot;, &quot;agender&quot;, or &quot;bigender&quot;, and to designate pronouns, including &quot;they&quot;/&quot;them&quot;, which they wish to be used when referring to them. Explicitly designating one&#x27;s pronouns as &quot;they&quot;/&quot;them&quot; increases the chance that people will interpret &quot;they&quot; as singular. Though &quot;singular &quot;they&quot;&quot; has long been used with antecedents such as &quot;everybody&quot; or generic persons of unknown gender, this use, which may be chosen by an individual, is recent. The earliest recorded usage of this sense documented by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is in a tweet from 2009; the journal &quot;American Speech&quot; documents an example from 2008 in an article in the journal &quot;Women&#x27;s Studies Quarterly&quot;. As of 2020, singular &quot;they&quot; is the most popular pronoun set used by non-binary people. Approximately 80% consider it appropriate for themselves.

The singular &quot;they&quot; in the meaning &quot;gender-neutral singular pronoun for a known person, as a non-binary identifier&quot; was chosen by the American Dialect Society as their &quot;Word of the Year&quot; for 2015. In 2016, the American Dialect Society wrote:
The vote followed the previous year&#x27;s approval of this use by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; style guide, when Bill Walsh, the &quot;Post&quot;″s copy editor, said that the singular &quot;they&quot; is &quot;the only sensible solution to English&#x27;s lack of a gender-neutral third-person singular personal pronoun&quot;.

In 2019, the non-binary &quot;they&quot; was added to Merriam-Webster&#x27;s dictionary.

The first non-binary main character on North American television appeared on the Showtime drama series &quot;Billions&quot; in 2017, with Asia Kate Dillon playing Taylor Mason. Both actor and character use singular &quot;they&quot;.

==Acceptability and prescriptive guidance==

Though both generic &quot;he&quot; and generic &quot;they&quot; have long histories of use, and both are still used, both are also systematically avoided by particular groups.

Style guides that avoid expressing a preference for either approach sometimes recommend recasting a problem sentence, for instance replacing generic expressions with plurals to avoid the criticisms of either party.

Sources differ about whether singular &quot;they&quot; is more accepted in British or American English, with &quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot; stating British English and &quot;A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language&quot; stating American English.

===Usage guidance in American style guides===
====&quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern American Usage&quot;====
&quot;Garner&#x27;s Modern American Usage&quot; (4th ed., 2016) recommends cautious use of singular &quot;they&quot;, and avoidance where possible because its use is stigmatized.

Garner suggests that use of singular &quot;they&quot; is more acceptable in British English:

and apparently regrets the resistance by the American language community:

He regards the trend toward using singular &quot;they&quot; with antecedents like &quot;everybody&quot;, &quot;anyone&quot; and &quot;somebody&quot; as inevitable:

Garner also notes that &quot;resistance to the singular &quot;they&quot; is fast receding&quot; in all national varieties of English.

====&quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;====
In the 14th edition (1993) of &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot;, the University of Chicago Press explicitly recommended using singular &quot;they&quot; and &quot;their&quot;, noting a &quot;revival&quot; of this usage and citing &quot;its venerable use by such writers as Addison, Austen, Chesterfield, Fielding, Ruskin, Scott, and Shakespeare.&quot;
From the 15th edition (2003), this was changed. In Chapter 5 of the 17th edition (2017), now written by Bryan A. Garner, the recommendations are:

====&quot;Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association&quot;====
The 7th edition of the American Psychological Association&#x27;s &quot;Publication Manual&quot;, released in October 2019, advises using singular &quot;they&quot; when gender is unknown or irrelevant, and gives the following example:

APA style also endorses using if it is someone&#x27;s (for example, a non-binary person&#x27;s) preferred pronoun set.

====Strunk &amp; White&#x27;s &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;====
William Strunk Jr. &amp; E. B. White, the original authors of &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;, found use of &quot;they&quot; with a singular antecedent unacceptable and advised use of the singular pronoun (&quot;he&quot;). In the 3rd edition (1979), the recommendation was still:

The assessment, in 1979, was that:

In the 4th edition (2000), use of singular &quot;they&quot; was still proscribed against, but use of generic &quot;he&quot; was no longer recommended.

====Joseph M. Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Basics of Clarity and Grace&quot; (2009)====
Joseph M. Williams, who wrote a number of books on writing with &quot;&quot;, discusses the advantages and disadvantages of various solutions when faced with the problem of referring to an antecedent such as &quot;someone&quot;, &quot;everyone&quot;, &quot;no one&quot; or a noun that does not indicate gender and suggests that this will continue to be a problem for some time. He &quot;suspect[s] that eventually we will accept the plural &quot;they&quot; as a correct singular&quot; but states that currently &quot;formal usage requires a singular pronoun&quot;.

====&quot;Purdue Online Writing Lab&quot;====
The &quot;Purdue Online Writing Lab&quot; (&quot;OWL&quot;) states that &quot;grammar shifts and changes over time&quot;, that the use of singular &quot;they&quot; is acceptable, and that singular &quot;they&quot; as a replacement for &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot; is more inclusive:

====&quot;The Washington Post&quot;====
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; stylebook, as of 2015, recommends trying to &quot;write around the problem, perhaps by changing singulars to plurals, before using the singular they as a last resort&quot; and specifically permits use of &quot;they&quot; for a &quot;gender-nonconforming person&quot;.

====&quot;Associated Press Stylebook&quot;====
The &quot;Associated Press Stylebook&quot;, as of 2017, recommends: &quot;&quot;they&quot;/&quot;them&quot;/&quot;their&quot; is acceptable in limited cases as a singular and-or gender-neutral pronoun, when alternative wording is overly awkward or clumsy. However, rewording usually is possible and always is preferable.&quot;

====&quot;The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing&quot;====
In &quot;The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing&quot;, Casey Miller and Kate Swift accept or recommend singular uses of &quot;they&quot; in cases where there is an element of semantic plurality expressed by a word such as &quot;everyone&quot; or where an indeterminate &quot;person&quot; is referred to, citing examples of such usage in formal speech. They also suggest rewriting sentences to use a plural &quot;they&quot;, eliminating pronouns, or recasting sentences to use &quot;one&quot; or (for babies) &quot;it&quot;.

===Usage guidance in British style guides===

In the first edition of &quot;A Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot; (published in 1926) use of the generic &quot;he&quot; is recommended. It is stated that singular &quot;they&quot; is disapproved of by grammarians. Numerous examples of its use by eminent writers in the past are given, but it is stated that &quot;few good modern writers would flout [grammarians] so conspicuously as Fielding and Thackeray&quot;, whose sentences are described as having an &quot;old-fashioned sound&quot;.
The second edition, &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot; (edited by Sir Ernest Gowers and published in 1965) continues to recommend use of the generic &quot;he&quot;; use of the singular &quot;they&quot; is called &quot;the popular solution&quot;, which &quot;sets the literary man&#x27;s teeth on edge&quot;. It is stated that singular &quot;they&quot; is still disapproved of by grammarians but common in colloquial speech.
According to the third edition, &quot;The New Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot; (edited by Robert Burchfield and published in 1996) singular &quot;they&quot; has not only been widely used by good writers for centuries, but is now generally accepted, except by some conservative grammarians, including the Fowler of 1926, who, it is argued, ignored the evidence:


&quot;The Complete Plain Words&quot; was originally written in 1948 by Ernest Gowers, a civil servant, in an attempt by the British civil service to improve &quot;official English&quot;. A second edition, edited by Sir Bruce Fraser, was published in 1973. It refers to &quot;they&quot; or &quot;them&quot; as the &quot;equivalent of a singular pronoun of common sex&quot; as &quot;common in speech and not unknown in serious writing &quot; but &quot;stigmatized by grammarians as usage grammatically indefensible. The book&#x27;s advice for &quot;official writers&quot; (civil servants) is to avoid its use and not to be tempted by its &quot;greater convenience&quot;, though &quot;necessity may eventually force it into the category of accepted idiom&quot;.
A new edition of &quot;Plain Words&quot;, revised and updated by Gowers&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Rebecca Gowers, was published in 2014.
It notes that singular &quot;they&quot; and &quot;them&quot; have become much more widespread since Gowers&#x27; original comments, but still finds it &quot;safer&quot; to treat a sentence like &#x27;The reader may toss their book aside&#x27; as incorrect &quot;in formal English&quot;, while rejecting even more strongly sentences like

&quot;The Times Style and Usage Guide&quot; (first published in 2003 by &quot;The Times&quot; of London) recommends avoiding sentences like

by using a plural construction:

&quot;The Cambridge Guide to English Usage&quot; (2004, Cambridge University Press) finds singular &quot;they&quot; &quot;unremarkable&quot;:
It expresses several preferences.
* &quot;Generic/universal &quot;their&quot; provides a gender-free pronoun, avoiding the exclusive &quot;his&quot; and the clumsy &quot;his/her&quot;. It avoids gratuitous sexism and gives the statement broadest reference ... &quot;They&quot;, &quot;them&quot;, &quot;their&quot; are now freely used in agreement with singular indefinite pronouns and determiners, those with universal implications such as any(one), every(one), no(one), as well as each and some(one), whose reference is often more individual ...&quot;
&quot;The Economist Style Guide&quot; refers to the use of &quot;they&quot; in sentences like

as &quot;scrambled syntax that people adopt because they cannot bring themselves to use a singular pronoun&quot;.
&quot;New Hart&#x27;s Rules&quot; (Oxford University Press, 2012) is aimed at those engaged in copy editing, and the emphasis is on the formal elements of presentation including punctuation and typeface, rather than on linguistic style, although – like &quot;The Chicago Manual of Style&quot; – it makes occasional forays into matters of usage. It advises against use of the purportedly gender-neutral &quot;he&quot;, and suggests cautious use of &quot;they&quot; where &quot;he or she&quot; presents problems.

The 2011 edition of the &quot;New International Version Bible&quot; uses singular &quot;they&quot; instead of the traditional &quot;he&quot; when translating pronouns that apply to both genders in the original Greek or Hebrew. This decision was based on research by a commission that studied modern English usage and determined that singular &quot;they&quot; (&quot;them&quot;/&quot;their&quot;) was by far the most common way that English-language speakers and writers today refer back to singular antecedents such as &quot;whoever&quot;, &quot;anyone&quot;, &quot;somebody&quot;, &quot;a person&quot;, &quot;no one&quot;, and the like.&quot;

The British edition of &quot;The Handbook of Nonsexist Writing&quot;, modified in some respects from the original US edition to conform to differences in culture and vocabulary, preserved the same recommendations, allowing singular &quot;they&quot; with semantically plural terms like &quot;everyone&quot; and indeterminate ones like &quot;person&quot;, but recommending a rewrite to avoid.

===Australian usage guidance===
The Australian &quot;Federation Press Style Guide for Use in Preparation of Book Manuscripts&quot; recommends &quot;gender-neutral language should be used&quot;, stating that use of &quot;they&quot; and &quot;their&quot; as singular pronouns is acceptable.

===Usage guidance in English grammars===

&quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot; discusses the prescriptivist argument that &quot;they&quot; is a plural pronoun and that the use of &quot;they&quot; with a singular &quot;antecedent&quot; therefore violates the rule of agreement between antecedent and pronoun, but takes the view that &quot;they&quot;, though &quot;primarily&quot; plural, can also be singular in a secondary &quot;extended&quot; sense, comparable to the purportedly extended sense of &quot;he&quot; to include female gender.

Use of singular &quot;they&quot; is stated to be &quot;particularly common&quot;, even &quot;stylistically neutral&quot; with antecedents such as &quot;everyone&quot;, &quot;someone&quot;, and &quot;no one&quot;, but more restricted when referring to common nouns as antecedents, as in

Use of the pronoun &quot;themself&quot; is described as being &quot;rare&quot; and &quot;acceptable only to a minority of speakers&quot;, while use of the morphologically plural &quot;themselves&quot; is considered problematic when referring to &quot;someone&quot; rather than &quot;everyone&quot; (since only the latter implies a plural set).

There are also issues of grammatical acceptability when reflexive pronouns refer to singular noun phrases joined by &quot;or&quot;, the following all being problematic:

On the motivation for using singular &quot;they&quot;, &quot;A Student&#x27;s Introduction to English Grammar&quot; states:

The alternative &quot;he or she&quot; can be &quot;far too cumbersome&quot;, as in:

or even &quot;flatly ungrammatical&quot;, as in
&quot;Among younger speakers&quot;, use of singular &quot;they&quot; even with definite noun-phrase antecedents finds increasing acceptance, &quot;sidestepping any presumption about the sex of the person referred to&quot;, as in:


===Older style guides (not newly published after 2000)===

According to &quot;A Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language&quot; (1985):

====&quot;The Little, Brown Handbook&quot; (1992)====
According to &quot;The Little, Brown Handbook&quot;, most experts – and some teachers and employers – find use of singular &quot;they&quot; unacceptable:
It recommends using &quot;he or she&quot; or avoiding the problem by rewriting the sentence to use a plural or omit the pronoun.

====The American Heritage Book of English Usage (1996)====
According to &quot;The American Heritage Book of English Usage&quot; and its usage panel of selected writers, journalism professors, linguists, and other experts, many Americans avoid use of &quot;they&quot; to refer to a singular antecedent out of respect for a &quot;traditional&quot; grammatical rule, despite use of singular &quot;they&quot; by modern writers of note and mainstream publications:

==Grammatical and logical analysis==

===Notional agreement===
&quot;Notional agreement&quot; is the idea that some uses of &quot;they&quot; might refer to a grammatically singular antecedent seen as semantically plural:

According to &quot;notional agreement&quot;, in the Shakespeare quotation &quot;a mother&quot; is syntactically singular, but stands for all mothers; and in the Shaw quotation &quot;no man&quot; is syntactically singular (taking the singular form &quot;goes&quot;), but is semantically plural (&quot;all&quot; go [to kill] not to be killed), hence idiomatically requiring &quot;they&quot;. Such use, which goes back a long way, includes examples where the sex is known, as in the above examples.

===Distribution===
Distributive constructions apply a &quot;single&quot; idea to &quot;multiple&quot; members of a group.
They are typically marked in English by words like &quot;each&quot;, &quot;every&quot; and &quot;any&quot;. The simplest examples are applied to groups of two, and use words like &quot;either&quot; and &quot;or&quot; – &quot;Would you like tea or coffee?&quot;. Since distributive constructions apply an idea relevant to each individual in the group, rather than to the group as a whole, they are most often conceived of as singular, and a singular pronoun is used:


However, many languages, including English, show ambivalence in this regard. Because distribution also requires a group with more than one member, plural forms are sometimes used.

===Referential and non-referential anaphors===
The singular &quot;they&quot;, which uses the same verb form that plurals do, is typically used to refer to an indeterminate antecedent, for example:

In some sentences, typically those including words like &quot;every&quot; or &quot;any&quot;, the morphologically singular antecedent does not refer to a single entity but is &quot;anaphorically linked&quot; to the associated pronoun to indicate a set of pairwise relationships, as in the sentence:

Linguists like Steven Pinker and Rodney Huddleston explain sentences like this (and others) in terms of bound variables, a term borrowed from logic. Pinker prefers the terms &quot;quantifier&quot; and &quot;bound variable&quot; to &quot;antecedent&quot; and &quot;pronoun&quot;. He suggests that pronouns used as &quot;variables&quot; in this way are more appropriately regarded as homonyms of the equivalent referential pronouns.

The following shows different types of anaphoric reference, using various pronouns, including &quot;they&quot;:
* Coreferential, with a definite antecedent (the antecedent and the anaphoric pronoun both refer to the same real-world entity):

* Coreferential with an indefinite antecedent:

* Reference to a hypothetical, indefinite entity
* A bound variable pronoun is anaphorically linked to a quantifier (no single real-world or hypothetical entity is referenced; examples and explanations from Huddleston and Pullum, &quot;The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language&quot;):

==Cognitive efficiency==
A study of whether &quot;singular &quot;they&quot;&quot; is more &quot;difficult&quot; to understand than gendered pronouns found that &quot;singular &quot;they&quot; is a cognitively efficient substitute for generic &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;, particularly when the antecedent is nonreferential&quot; (e.g. &quot;anybody&quot;, &quot;a nurse&quot;, or &quot;a truck driver&quot;) rather than referring to a specific person (e.g. &quot;a runner I knew&quot; or &quot;my nurse&quot;). Clauses with singular &quot;they&quot; were read &quot;just as quickly as clauses containing a gendered pronoun that matched the stereotype of the antecedent&quot; (e.g. &quot;she&quot; for a nurse and &quot;he&quot; for a truck driver) and &quot;much more quickly than clauses containing a gendered pronoun that went against the gender stereotype of the antecedent&quot;.

On the other hand, when the pronoun &quot;they&quot; was used to refer to known individuals (&quot;referential antecedents, for which the gender was presumably known&quot;, e.g. &quot;my nurse&quot;, &quot;that truck driver&quot;, &quot;a runner I knew&quot;), reading was slowed when compared with use of a gendered pronoun consistent with the &quot;stereotypic gender&quot; (e.g. &quot;he&quot; for a specific truck driver).

The study concluded that &quot;the increased use of singular &quot;they&quot; is not problematic for the majority of readers&quot;.

A 2024 study by Arnold, Venkatesh, and Vig stated that two-thirds of people used an incorrect pronoun at least once in speaking about someone who used singular &quot;they&quot;, versus never when speaking about someone who used &quot;he&quot; or &quot;she&quot;, suggesting that singular &quot;they&quot; caused some difficulty, but the rate of errors was low (9%). They wrote that whereas people may repeat a name to avoid using the pronoun &quot;they&quot; in writing, in speech people used singular &quot;they&quot; at least as frequently as binary pronouns, &quot;suggesting that any difficulty does not result in pronoun avoidance&quot; in speech.

==Comparison with other pronouns==
The singular and plural use of &quot;they&quot; can be compared with the pronoun &quot;you&quot;, which had been both a plural and polite singular, but by the 18th century replaced &quot;thou&quot; for singular referents. For &quot;you&quot;, the singular reflexive pronoun (&quot;&quot;) is different from its plural reflexive pronoun (&quot;&quot;); with &quot;they&quot; one can hear either &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot; for the singular reflexive pronoun.

Singular &quot;they&quot; has also been compared to nosism (such as the &quot;royal we&quot;), when a single person uses first-person plural in place of first-person singular pronouns. Similar to singular &quot;you&quot;, its singular reflexive pronoun (&quot;&quot;) is different from the plural reflexive pronoun (&quot;&quot;).

While the pronoun set derived from &quot;it&quot; is primarily used for inanimate objects, &quot;it&quot; is frequently used in an impersonal context when someone&#x27;s identity is unknown or established on a provisional basis, e.g. &quot;Who is &quot;it&quot;?&quot; or &quot;With this new haircut, no one knows &quot;it&quot; is me.&quot; &quot;It&quot; is also used for infants of unspecified gender but may be considered dehumanizing and is therefore more likely in a clinical context. Otherwise, in more personal contexts, the use of &quot;it&quot; to refer to a person might indicate antipathy or other negative emotions.

&quot;It&quot; can also be used for non-human animals of unspecified sex, though &quot;they&quot; is common for pets and other domesticated animals of unspecified sex, especially when referred to by a proper name (e.g. &quot;Rags&quot;, &quot;Snuggles&quot;). Normally, birds and mammals with a known sex are referred to by their respective male or female pronoun (&quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot;; &quot;him&quot; and &quot;her&quot;).

So too we can choose to respect people&#x27;s pronouns for many reasons.&quot;

<text>The Space Shuttle is a retired, partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system operated from 1981 to 2011 by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as part of the Space Shuttle program. Its official program name was Space Transportation System (STS), taken from the 1969 plan led by U.S. Vice President Spiro Agnew for a system of reusable spacecraft where it was the only item funded for development.

The first (STS-1) of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981, leading to operational flights (STS-5) beginning in 1982. Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011. They launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), conducted science experiments in orbit, participated in the Shuttle-&quot;Mir&quot; program with Russia, and participated in the construction and servicing of the International Space Station (ISS). The Space Shuttle fleet&#x27;s total mission time was 1,323 days.

Space Shuttle components include the Orbiter Vehicle (OV) with three clustered Rocketdyne RS-25 main engines, a pair of recoverable solid rocket boosters (SRBs), and the expendable external tank (ET) containing liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The Space Shuttle was launched vertically, like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the orbiter&#x27;s three main engines, which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, while the main engines continued to operate, and the ET was jettisoned after main engine cutoff and just before orbit insertion, which used the orbiter&#x27;s two Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and reenter the atmosphere. The orbiter was protected during reentry by its thermal protection system tiles, and it glided as a spaceplane to a runway landing, usually to the Shuttle Landing Facility at KSC, Florida, or to Rogers Dry Lake in Edwards Air Force Base, California. If the landing occurred at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC atop the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA), a specially modified Boeing 747 designed to carry the shuttle above it.

The first orbiter, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, was built in 1976 and used in Approach and Landing Tests (ALT), but had no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: &quot;Columbia&quot;, &quot;Challenger&quot;, &quot;Discovery&quot;, and &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: &quot;Challenger&quot; in 1986 and &quot;Columbia&quot; in 2003, with a total of 14 astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, &quot;Endeavour&quot;, was built in 1991 to replace &quot;Challenger&quot;. The three surviving operational vehicles were retired from service following &quot;Atlantis&quot;″s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. relied on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft to transport astronauts to the ISS from the last Shuttle flight until the launch of the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission in May 2020.

== Design and development ==
===Historical background===
In the late 1930s, the German government launched the &quot;Amerikabomber&quot; project, and Eugen Sanger&#x27;s idea, together with mathematician Irene Bredt, was a winged rocket called the Silbervogel (German for &quot;silver bird&quot;). During the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and air-to-ground weapons employment. In the late 1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable X-20 Dyna-Soar. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of Project Gemini led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the aerospaceplane, a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962–1963.

Beginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing lifting bodies to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the NASA M2-F1, Northrop M2-F2, Northrop M2-F3, Northrop HL-10, Martin Marietta X-24A, and the Martin Marietta X-24B. The program tested aerodynamic characteristics that would later be incorporated in design of the Space Shuttle, including unpowered landing from a high altitude and speed.

===Design process===
On September 24, 1966, as the Apollo space program neared its design completion, NASA and the Air Force released a joint study concluding that a new vehicle was required to satisfy their respective future demands and that a partially reusable system would be the most cost-effective solution. The head of the NASA Office of Manned Space Flight, George Mueller, announced the plan for a reusable shuttle on August 10, 1968. NASA issued a request for proposal (RFP) for designs of the Integral Launch and Reentry Vehicle (ILRV) on October 30, 1968. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.

In December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to General Dynamics, Lockheed, McDonnell Douglas, and North American Rockwell. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support short-duration crewed missions and space station, as well as the capabilities to launch, service, and retrieve satellites. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under the leadership of U.S. Vice President Spiro Agnew, issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear upper stage for deep space travel.

After the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. Max Faget, a NASA engineer who had worked to design the Mercury capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster. The Air Force Flight Dynamics Laboratory argued that a straight-wing design would not be able to withstand the high thermal and aerodynamic stresses during reentry, and would not provide the required cross-range capability. Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget&#x27;s design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.

After they established the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force determined the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting to an eastward LEO or into a polar orbit. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a payload bay. NASA evaluated the F-1 and J-2 engines from the Saturn rockets, and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle; in July 1971, it issued a contract to Rocketdyne to begin development on the RS-25 engine.

NASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle and determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use solid-propellant boosters because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President Richard Nixon approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. The development of the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) remained the responsibility of Rocketdyne, and the contract was issued in July 1971, and updated SSME specifications were submitted to Rocketdyne that April. The following August, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, which had by then constructed a full-scale mock-up, later named &quot;Inspiration&quot;. In August 1973, NASA awarded the external tank contract to Martin Marietta, and in November the solid-rocket booster contract to Morton Thiokol.

=== Development ===
On June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first orbiter, OV-101, dubbed Constitution, later to be renamed &quot;Enterprise&quot;. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and &quot;Enterprise&quot; was moved to the Edwards Air Force Base to begin testing. Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL) to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile. Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.

The beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while Pratt &amp; Whitney challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttleable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.

NASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle&#x27;s thermal protection system. Previous NASA spacecraft had used ablative heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight aluminum, and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on &quot;Columbia&quot; on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the KSC on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, &quot;Columbia&quot; still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before &quot;Columbia&quot; could fly.

On January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named &quot;Challenger&quot;. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot;. Construction of OV-105, later named &quot;Endeavour&quot;, began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the loss of &quot;Challenger&quot;, NASA resumed production of &quot;Endeavour&quot; in September 1987.

===Testing===

After it arrived at Edwards AFB, &quot;Enterprise&quot; underwent flight testing with the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft, a Boeing 747 that had been modified to carry the orbiter. In February 1977, &quot;Enterprise&quot; began the Approach and Landing Tests (ALT) and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, &quot;Enterprise&quot; conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB. After four additional flights, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was moved to the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. &quot;Enterprise&quot; underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, &quot;Enterprise&quot; was taken to the KSC, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to LC-39. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of the launch complex hardware. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the SLC-6 at Vandenberg AFB in 1984.

On November 24, 1980, &quot;Columbia&quot; was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29. The first Space Shuttle mission, STS-1, would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by John Young and Robert Crippen. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the &quot;Columbia&quot;. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of &quot;Columbia&quot;, and determined there was no damage. &quot;Columbia&quot; reentered the atmosphere and landed at Edwards AFB on April 14.

NASA conducted three additional test flights with &quot;Columbia&quot; in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, STS-4, flown by Ken Mattingly and Henry Hartsfield, landed on a concrete runway at Edwards AFB. President Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared its Space Transportation System (STS) operational.

==Description==
The Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for reuse. Each Space Shuttle orbiter was designed for a projected lifespan of 100 launches or ten years of operational life, although this was later extended. At launch, it consisted of the orbiter, which contained the crew and payload, the external tank (ET), and the two solid rocket boosters (SRBs).

Responsibility for the Space Shuttle components was spread among multiple NASA field centers. The KSC was responsible for launch, landing, and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program). The U.S. Air Force at the Vandenberg Air Force Base was responsible for launch, landing, and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used). The Johnson Space Center (JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations and the MSFC was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters. The John C. Stennis Space Center handled main engine testing, and the Goddard Space Flight Center managed the global tracking network.

===Orbiter===

The orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-delta wings were long, and were swept 81° at the inner leading edge and 45° at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard elevon to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control pitch. The orbiter&#x27;s vertical stabilizer was swept backwards at 45° and contained a rudder that could split to act as a speed brake. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part drag parachute system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used retractable landing gear with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.

====Crew====
The Space Shuttle crew varied per mission. They underwent rigorous testing and training to meet the qualification requirements for their roles. The crew was divided into three categories: Pilots, Mission Specialists, and Payload Specialists. Pilots were further divided into two roles: the Space Shuttle Commander, who would seat in the forward left seat and the Space Shuttle Pilot who would seat in the forward right seat. The test flights, STS-1 through STS-4 only had two members each, the commander and pilot. The commander and the pilot were both qualified to fly and land the orbiter. The on-orbit operations, such as experiments, payload deployment, and EVAs, were conducted primarily by the mission specialists who were specifically trained for their intended missions and systems. Early in the Space Shuttle program, NASA flew with payload specialists, who were typically systems specialists who worked for the company paying for the payload&#x27;s deployment or operations. The final payload specialist, Gregory B. Jarvis, flew on STS-51-L, and future non-pilots were designated as mission specialists. An astronaut flew as a crewed spaceflight engineer on both STS-51-C and STS-51-J to serve as a military representative for a National Reconnaissance Office payload. A Space Shuttle crew typically had seven astronauts, with STS-61-A flying with eight.

====Crew compartment====
The crew compartment comprised three decks and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The flight deck consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck was located below the flight deck and was where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an extravehicular activity (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.

On the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, STS-5, until the loss of &quot;Challenger&quot;, the crew wore one-piece light blue nomex flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. &quot;Columbia&quot; originally had modified SR-71 zero-zero ejection seats installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after STS-9.
The flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a heads-up display (HUD) and a Rotational Hand Controller (RHC) to gimbal the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had rudder controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction CRT Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the aft seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, &quot;Atlantis&quot; was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a glass cockpit upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on STS-101, and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight deck contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the Remote Manipulator System during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a closed-circuit television to view the cargo bay.

The mid-deck contained the crew equipment storage, sleeping area, galley, medical equipment, and hygiene stations for the crew. The crew used modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on their needs, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that the crew used for entry and exit while on Earth.

==== Airlock ====
The airlock is a structure installed to allow movement between two spaces with different gas components, conditions, or pressures. Continuing on the mid-deck structure, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was installed as an external airlock in the payload bay on &quot;Discovery&quot;, &quot;Atlantis&quot;, and &quot;Endeavour&quot; to improve docking with Mir and the ISS, along with the Orbiter Docking System. The airlock module can be fitted in the mid-bay, or connected to it but in the payload bay. With an internal cylindrical volume of diameter and in length, it can hold two suited astronauts. It has two D-shaped hatchways long (diameter), and wide.

====Flight systems====
The orbiter was equipped with an avionics system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three microwave scanning beam landing systems, three gyroscopes, three TACANs, three accelerometers, two radar altimeters, two barometric altimeters, three attitude indicators, two Mach indicators, and two Mode C transponders. During reentry, the crew deployed two air data probes once they were traveling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three inertial measuring units (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two star trackers to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an inertial navigation system (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a GPS receiver for the first time aboard STS-51. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on STS-118 in August 2007.

While in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four S band radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were phase modulation transceivers, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were frequency modulation transmitters and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their line of sight, NASA used the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System and the Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth Ku band radio out of the cargo bay, which could also be utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two UHF radios for communications with air traffic control and astronauts conducting EVA.
The Space Shuttle&#x27;s fly-by-wire control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general-purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitor the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM AP-101B, which used a separate central processing unit (CPU) and input/output processor (IOP), and non-volatile solid-state memory. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvering, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission. The Space Shuttle was not launched if its flight would run from December to January, as its flight software would have required the orbiter vehicle&#x27;s computers to be reset at the year change. In 2007, NASA engineers devised a solution so Space Shuttle flights could cross the year-end boundary.

Space Shuttle missions typically brought a portable general support computer (PGSC) that could integrate with the orbiter vehicle&#x27;s computers and communication suite, as well as monitor scientific and payload data. Early missions brought the Grid Compass, one of the first laptop computers, as the PGSC, but later missions brought Apple and Intel laptops.

====Payload bay====

The payload bay comprised most of the orbiter vehicle&#x27;s fuselage, and provided the cargo-carrying space for the Space Shuttle&#x27;s payloads. It was long and wide, and could accommodate cylindrical payloads up to in diameter. Two payload bay doors hinged on either side of the bay, and provided a relatively airtight seal to protect payloads from heating during launch and reentry. Payloads were secured in the payload bay to the attachment points on the longerons. The payload bay doors served an additional function as radiators for the orbiter vehicle&#x27;s heat, and were opened upon reaching orbit for heat rejection.

The orbiter could be used in conjunction with a variety of add-on components depending on the mission. This included orbital laboratories, boosters for launching payloads farther into space, the Remote Manipulator System (RMS), and optionally the EDO pallet to extend the mission duration. To limit the fuel consumption while the orbiter was docked at the ISS, the Station-to-Shuttle Power Transfer System (SSPTS) was developed to convert and transfer station power to the orbiter. The SSPTS was first used on STS-118, and was installed on &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Endeavour&quot;.

====Remote Manipulator System====
The Remote Manipulator System (RMS), also known as Canadarm, was a mechanical arm attached to the cargo bay. It could be used to grasp and manipulate payloads, as well as serve as a mobile platform for astronauts conducting an EVA. The RMS was built by the Canadian company Spar Aerospace and was controlled by an astronaut inside the orbiter&#x27;s flight deck using their windows and closed-circuit television. The RMS allowed for six degrees of freedom and had six joints located at three points along the arm. The original RMS could deploy or retrieve payloads up to , which was later improved to .

====Spacelab====

The Spacelab module was a European-funded pressurized laboratory that was carried within the payload bay and allowed for scientific research while in orbit. The Spacelab module contained two segments that were mounted in the aft end of the payload bay to maintain the center of gravity during flight. Astronauts entered the Spacelab module through a tunnel that connected to the airlock. The Spacelab equipment was primarily stored in pallets, which provided storage for both experiments as well as computer and power equipment. Spacelab hardware was flown on 28 missions through 1999 and studied subjects including astronomy, microgravity, radar, and life sciences. Spacelab hardware also supported missions such as Hubble Space Telescope (HST) servicing and space station resupply. The Spacelab module was tested on STS-2 and STS-3, and the first full mission was on STS-9.

====RS-25 engines====

Three RS-25 engines, also known as the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), were mounted on the orbiter&#x27;s aft fuselage in a triangular pattern. The engine nozzles could gimbal ±10.5° in pitch, and ±8.5° in yaw during ascent to change the direction of their thrust to steer the Shuttle. The titanium alloy reusable engines were independent of the orbiter vehicle and would be removed and replaced in between flights. The RS-25 is a staged-combustion cycle cryogenic engine that used liquid oxygen and hydrogen and had a higher chamber pressure than any previous liquid-fueled rocket. The original main combustion chamber operated at a maximum pressure of . The engine nozzle is tall and has an interior diameter of . The nozzle is cooled by 1,080 interior lines carrying liquid hydrogen and is thermally protected by insulative and ablative material.

The RS-25 engines had several improvements to enhance reliability and power. During the development program, Rocketdyne determined that the engine was capable of safe reliable operation at 104% of the originally specified thrust. To keep the engine thrust values consistent with previous documentation and software, NASA kept the originally specified thrust at 100%, but had the RS-25 operate at higher thrust. RS-25 upgrade versions were denoted as Block I and Block II. 109% thrust level was achieved with the Block II engines in 2001, which reduced the chamber pressure to , as it had a larger throat area. The normal maximum throttle was 104 percent, with 106% or 109% used for mission aborts.

====Orbital Maneuvering System====
The Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) consisted of two aft-mounted AJ10-190 engines and the associated propellant tanks. The AJ10 engines used monomethylhydrazine (MMH) oxidized by dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The pods carried a maximum of of MMH and of N2O4. The OMS engines were used after main engine cut-off (MECO) for orbital insertion. Throughout the flight, they were used for orbit changes, as well as the deorbit burn prior to reentry. Each OMS engine produced of thrust, and the entire system could provide of velocity change.

====Thermal protection system====
The orbiter was protected from heat during reentry by the thermal protection system (TPS), a thermal soaking protective layer around the orbiter. In contrast with previous US spacecraft, which had used ablative heat shields, the reusability of the orbiter required a multi-use heat shield. During reentry, the TPS experienced temperatures up to , but had to keep the orbiter vehicle&#x27;s aluminum skin temperature below . The TPS primarily consisted of four types of tiles. The nose cone and leading edges of the wings experienced temperatures above , and were protected by reinforced carbon-carbon tiles (RCC). Thicker RCC tiles were developed and installed in 1998 to prevent damage from micrometeoroid and orbital debris, and were further improved after RCC damage caused in the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster. Beginning with STS-114, the orbiter vehicles were equipped with the wing leading edge impact detection system to alert the crew to any potential damage. The entire underside of the orbiter vehicle, as well as the other hottest surfaces, were protected with tiles of high-temperature reusable surface insulation, made of borosilicate glass-coated silica fibers that trapped heat in air pockets and redirected it out. Areas on the upper parts of the orbiter vehicle were coated in tiles of white low-temperature reusable surface insulation with similar composition, which provided protection for temperatures below . The payload bay doors and parts of the upper wing surfaces were coated in reusable Nomex felt surface insulation or in beta cloth, as the temperature there remained below .

===External tank===
The Space Shuttle external tank (ET) carried the propellant for the Space Shuttle Main Engines, and connected the orbiter vehicle with the solid rocket boosters. The ET was tall and in diameter, and contained separate tanks for liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The liquid oxygen tank was housed in the nose of the ET, and was tall. The liquid hydrogen tank comprised the bulk of the ET, and was tall. The orbiter vehicle was attached to the ET at two umbilical plates, which contained five propellant and two electrical umbilicals, and forward and aft structural attachments. The exterior of the ET was covered in orange spray-on foam to allow it to survive the heat of ascent.

The ET provided propellant to the Space Shuttle Main Engines from liftoff until main engine cutoff. The ET separated from the orbiter vehicle 18 seconds after engine cutoff and could be triggered automatically or manually. At the time of separation, the orbiter vehicle retracted its umbilical plates, and the umbilical cords were sealed to prevent excess propellant from venting into the orbiter vehicle. After the bolts attached at the structural attachments were sheared, the ET separated from the orbiter vehicle. At the time of separation, gaseous oxygen was vented from the nose to cause the ET to tumble, ensuring that it would break up upon reentry. The ET was the only major component of the Space Shuttle system that was not reused, and it would travel along a ballistic trajectory into the Indian or Pacific Ocean.

For the first two missions, STS-1 and STS-2, the ET was covered in of white fire-retardant latex paint to provide protection against damage from ultraviolet radiation. Further research determined that the orange foam itself was sufficiently protected, and the ET was no longer covered in latex paint beginning on STS-3. A light-weight tank (LWT) was first flown on STS-6, which reduced tank weight by . The LWT&#x27;s weight was reduced by removing components from the hydrogen tank and reducing the thickness of some skin panels. In 1998, a super light-weight ET (SLWT) first flew on STS-91. The SLWT used the 2195 aluminum-lithium alloy, which was 40% stronger and 10% less dense than its predecessor, 2219 aluminum-lithium alloy. The SLWT weighed less than the LWT, which allowed the Space Shuttle to deliver heavy elements to ISS&#x27;s high inclination orbit.

===Solid Rocket Boosters===

The Solid Rocket Boosters (SRB) provided 71.4% of the Space Shuttle&#x27;s thrust during liftoff and ascent, and were the largest solid-propellant motors ever flown. Each SRB was tall and wide, weighed , and had a steel exterior approximately thick. The SRB&#x27;s subcomponents were the solid-propellant motor, nose cone, and rocket nozzle. The solid-propellant motor comprised the majority of the SRB&#x27;s structure. Its casing consisted of 11 steel sections which made up its four main segments. The nose cone housed the forward separation motors and the parachute systems that were used during recovery. The rocket nozzles could gimbal up to 8° to allow for in-flight adjustments.

The rocket motors were each filled with a total of solid rocket propellant (APCP+PBAN), and joined in the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at KSC. In addition to providing thrust during the first stage of launch, the SRBs provided structural support for the orbiter vehicle and ET, as they were the only system that was connected to the mobile launcher platform (MLP). At the time of launch, the SRBs were armed at T−5 minutes, and could only be electrically ignited once the RS-25 engines had ignited and were without issue. They each provided of thrust, which was later improved to beginning on STS-8. After expending their fuel, the SRBs were jettisoned approximately two minutes after launch at an altitude of approximately . Following separation, they deployed drogue and main parachutes, landed in the ocean, and were recovered by the crews aboard the ships MV &quot;Freedom Star&quot; and MV &quot;Liberty Star&quot;. Once they were returned to Cape Canaveral, they were cleaned and disassembled. The rocket motor, igniter, and nozzle were then shipped to Thiokol to be refurbished and reused on subsequent flights.

The SRBs underwent several redesigns throughout the program&#x27;s lifetime. STS-6 and STS-7 used SRBs lighter due to walls that were thinner, but were determined to be too thin to fly safely. Subsequent flights until STS-26 used cases that were thinner than the standard-weight cases, which reduced . After the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster as a result of an O-ring failing at low temperature, the SRBs were redesigned to provide a constant seal regardless of the ambient temperature.

===Support vehicles===
The Space Shuttle&#x27;s operations were supported by vehicles and infrastructure that facilitated its transportation, construction, and crew access. The crawler-transporters carried the MLP and the Space Shuttle from the VAB to the launch site. The Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) were two modified Boeing 747s that could carry an orbiter on its back. The original SCA (N905NA) was first flown in 1975, and was used for the ALT and ferrying the orbiter from Edwards AFB to the KSC on all missions prior to 1991. A second SCA (N911NA) was acquired in 1988, and was first used to transport &quot;Endeavour&quot; from the factory to the KSC. Following the retirement of the Space Shuttle, N905NA was put on display at the JSC, and N911NA was put on display at the Joe Davies Heritage Airpark in Palmdale, California. The Crew Transport Vehicle (CTV) was a modified airport jet bridge that was used to assist astronauts to egress from the orbiter after landing, where they would undergo their post-mission medical checkups. The Astrovan transported astronauts from the crew quarters in the Operations and Checkout Building to the launch pad on launch day. The NASA Railroad comprised three locomotives that transported SRB segments from the Florida East Coast Railway in Titusville to the KSC.

==Mission profile==
===Launch preparation===

The Space Shuttle was prepared for launch primarily in the VAB at the KSC. The SRBs were assembled and attached to the external tank on the MLP. The orbiter vehicle was prepared at the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) and transferred to the VAB, where a crane was used to rotate it to the vertical orientation and mate it to the external tank. Once the entire stack was assembled, the MLP was carried for to Launch Complex 39 by one of the crawler-transporters. After the Space Shuttle arrived at one of the two launchpads, it would connect to the Fixed and Rotation Service Structures, which provided servicing capabilities, payload insertion, and crew transportation. The crew was transported to the launch pad at T−3 hours and entered the orbiter vehicle, which was closed at T−2 hours. Liquid oxygen and hydrogen were loaded into the external tank via umbilicals that attached to the orbiter vehicle, which began at T−5 hours 35 minutes. At T−3 hours 45 minutes, the hydrogen fast-fill was complete, followed 15 minutes later by the oxygen tank fill. Both tanks were slowly filled up until the launch as the oxygen and hydrogen evaporated.

The launch commit criteria considered precipitation, temperatures, cloud cover, lightning forecast, wind, and humidity. The Space Shuttle was not launched under conditions where it could have been struck by lightning, as its exhaust plume could have triggered lightning by providing a current path to ground after launch, which occurred on Apollo 12. The NASA Anvil Rule for a Shuttle launch stated that an anvil cloud could not appear within a distance of . The Shuttle Launch Weather Officer monitored conditions until the final decision to scrub a launch was announced. In addition to the weather at the launch site, conditions had to be acceptable at one of the Transatlantic Abort Landing sites and the SRB recovery area.

===Launch===

The mission crew and the Launch Control Center (LCC) personnel completed systems checks throughout the countdown. Two built-in holds at T−20 minutes and T−9 minutes provided scheduled breaks to address any issues and additional preparation. After the built-in hold at T−9 minutes, the countdown was automatically controlled by the Ground Launch Sequencer (GLS) at the LCC, which stopped the countdown if it sensed a critical problem with any of the Space Shuttle&#x27;s onboard systems. At T−3 minutes 45 seconds, the engines began conducting gimbal tests, which were concluded at T−2 minutes 15 seconds. The ground Launch Processing System handed off the control to the orbiter vehicle&#x27;s GPCs at T−31 seconds. At T−16 seconds, the GPCs armed the SRBs, the sound suppression system (SPS) began to drench the MLP and SRB trenches with of water to protect the orbiter vehicle from damage by acoustical energy and rocket exhaust reflected from the flame trench and MLP during lift-off. At T−10 seconds, hydrogen igniters were activated under each engine bell to quell the stagnant gas inside the cones before ignition. Failure to burn these gases could trip the onboard sensors and create the possibility of an overpressure and explosion of the vehicle during the firing phase. The hydrogen tank&#x27;s prevalves were opened at T−9.5 seconds in preparation for engine start.
Beginning at T−6.6 seconds, the main engines were ignited sequentially at 120-millisecond intervals. All three RS-25 engines were required to reach 90% rated thrust by T−3 seconds, otherwise the GPCs would initiate an RSLS abort. If all three engines indicated nominal performance by T−3 seconds, they were commanded to gimbal to liftoff configuration and the command would be issued to arm the SRBs for ignition at T−0. Between T−6.6 seconds and T−3 seconds, while the RS-25 engines were firing but the SRBs were still bolted to the pad, the offset thrust would cause the Space Shuttle to pitch down measured at the tip of the external tank; the 3-second delay allowed the stack to return to nearly vertical before SRB ignition. This movement was nicknamed the &quot;twang.&quot; At T−0, the eight frangible nuts holding the SRBs to the pad were detonated, the final umbilicals were disconnected, the SSMEs were commanded to 100% throttle, and the SRBs were ignited. By T+0.23 seconds, the SRBs built up enough thrust for liftoff to commence, and reached maximum chamber pressure by T+0.6 seconds. At T−0, the JSC Mission Control Center assumed control of the flight from the LCC.
At T+4 seconds, when the Space Shuttle reached an altitude of , the RS-25 engines were throttled up to 104.5%. At approximately T+7 seconds, the Space Shuttle rolled to a heads-down orientation at an altitude of , which reduced aerodynamic stress and provided an improved communication and navigation orientation. Approximately 20–30 seconds into ascent and an altitude of , the RS-25 engines were throttled down to 65–72% to reduce the maximum aerodynamic forces at Max Q. Additionally, the shape of the SRB propellant was designed to cause thrust to decrease at the time of Max Q. The GPCs could dynamically control the throttle of the RS-25 engines based upon the performance of the SRBs.
At approximately T+123 seconds and an altitude of , pyrotechnic fasteners released the SRBs, which reached an apogee of before parachuting into the Atlantic Ocean. The Space Shuttle continued its ascent using only the RS-25 engines. On earlier missions, the Space Shuttle remained in the heads-down orientation to maintain communications with the tracking station in Bermuda, but later missions, beginning with STS-87, rolled to a heads-up orientation at T+6 minutes for communication with the tracking and data relay satellite constellation. The RS-25 engines were throttled at T+7 minutes 30 seconds to limit vehicle acceleration to 3 &quot;g&quot;. At 6 seconds prior to main engine cutoff (MECO), which occurred at T+8 minutes 30 seconds, the RS-25 engines were throttled down to 67%. The GPCs controlled ET separation and dumped the remaining liquid oxygen and hydrogen to prevent outgassing while in orbit. The ET continued on a ballistic trajectory and broke up during reentry, with some small pieces landing in the Indian or Pacific Ocean.

Early missions used two firings of the OMS to achieve orbit; the first firing raised the apogee while the second circularized the orbit. Missions after STS-38 used the RS-25 engines to achieve the optimal apogee, and used the OMS engines to circularize the orbit. The orbital altitude and inclination were mission-dependent, and the Space Shuttle&#x27;s orbits varied from .

===In orbit===
The type of mission the Space Shuttle was assigned to dictate the type of orbit that it entered. The initial design of the reusable Space Shuttle envisioned an increasingly cheap launch platform to deploy commercial and government satellites. Early missions routinely ferried satellites, which determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle would enter. Following the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as the Delta II. While later missions still launched commercial payloads, Space Shuttle assignments were routinely directed towards scientific payloads, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, Spacelab, and the Galileo spacecraft. Beginning with STS-71, the orbiter vehicle conducted dockings with the Mir space station. In its final decade of operation, the Space Shuttle was used for the construction of the International Space Station. Most missions involved staying in orbit several days to two weeks, although longer missions were possible with the Extended Duration Orbiter pallet. The 17 day 15 hour STS-80 mission was the longest Space Shuttle mission duration.

===Re-entry and landing===
Approximately four hours prior to deorbit, the crew began preparing the orbiter vehicle for reentry by closing the payload doors, radiating excess heat, and retracting the Ku band antenna. The orbiter vehicle maneuvered to an upside-down, tail-first orientation and began a 2–4 minute OMS burn approximately 20 minutes before it reentered the atmosphere. The orbiter vehicle reoriented itself to a nose-forward position with a 40° angle-of-attack, and the forward reaction control system (RCS) jets were emptied of fuel and disabled prior to reentry. The orbiter vehicle&#x27;s reentry was defined as starting at an altitude of , when it was traveling at approximately Mach 25. The orbiter vehicle&#x27;s reentry was controlled by the GPCs, which followed a preset angle-of-attack plan to prevent unsafe heating of the TPS. During reentry, the orbiter&#x27;s speed was regulated by altering the amount of drag produced, which was controlled by means of angle of attack, as well as bank angle. The latter could be used to control drag without changing the angle of attack. A series of roll reversals were performed to control azimuth while banking. The orbiter vehicle&#x27;s aft RCS jets were disabled as its ailerons, elevators, and rudder became effective in the lower atmosphere. At an altitude of , the orbiter vehicle opened its speed brake on the vertical stabilizer. At 8 minutes 44 seconds prior to landing, the crew deployed the air data probes, and began lowering the angle-of-attack to 36°. The orbiter&#x27;s maximum glide ratio/lift-to-drag ratio varied considerably with speed, ranging from 1.3 at hypersonic speeds to 4.9 at subsonic speeds. The orbiter vehicle flew to one of the two Heading Alignment Cones, located away from each end of the runway&#x27;s centerline, where it made its final turns to dissipate excess energy prior to its approach and landing. Once the orbiter vehicle was traveling subsonically, the crew took over manual control of the flight.
The approach and landing phase began when the orbiter vehicle was at an altitude of and traveling at . The orbiter followed either a 20° or 18° glideslope and descended at approximately . The speed brake was used to keep a continuous speed, and crew initiated a pre-flare maneuver to a 1.5° glideslope at an altitude of . The landing gear was deployed 10 seconds prior to touchdown, when the orbiter was at an altitude of and traveling . A final flare maneuver reduced the orbiter vehicle&#x27;s descent rate to , with touchdown occurring at , depending on the weight of the orbiter vehicle. After the landing gear touched down, the crew deployed a drag chute out of the vertical stabilizer, and began wheel braking when the orbiter was traveling slower than . After the orbiter&#x27;s wheels stopped, the crew deactivated the flight components and prepared to exit.

====Landing sites====
The primary Space Shuttle landing site was the Shuttle Landing Facility at KSC, where 78 of the 133 successful landings occurred. In the event of unfavorable landing conditions, the Shuttle could delay its landing or land at an alternate location. The primary alternate was Edwards AFB, which was used for 54 landings. STS-3 landed at the White Sands Space Harbor in New Mexico and required extensive post-processing after exposure to the gypsum-rich sand, some of which was found in &quot;Columbia&quot; debris after STS-107. Landings at alternate airfields required the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft to transport the orbiter back to Cape Canaveral.

In addition to the pre-planned landing airfields, there were 85 agreed-upon emergency landing sites to be used in different abort scenarios, with 58 located in other countries. The landing locations were chosen based upon political relationships, favorable weather, a runway at least long, and TACAN or DME equipment. Additionally, as the orbiter vehicle only had UHF radios, international sites with only VHF radios would have been unable to communicate directly with the crew. Facilities on the east coast of the US were planned for East Coast Abort Landings, while several sites in Europe and Africa were planned in the event of a Transoceanic Abort Landing. The facilities were prepared with equipment and personnel in the event of an emergency shuttle landing but were never used.

===Post-landing processing===

After the landing, ground crews approached the orbiter to conduct safety checks. Teams wearing self-contained breathing gear tested for the presence of hydrogen, hydrazine, monomethylhydrazine, nitrogen tetroxide, and ammonia to ensure the landing area was safe. Air conditioning and Freon lines were connected to cool the crew and equipment and dissipate excess heat from reentry. A flight surgeon boarded the orbiter and performed medical checks of the crew before they disembarked. 
Once the orbiter was secured, it was towed to the OPF to be inspected, repaired, and prepared for the next mission. The processing included:
* removal and installation of mission-specific items and payloads
* draining of waste and leftover consumables, and refilling of new consumables
* inspection and (if necessary) repair of the thermal protection system
* checkout and servicing of main engines (done in the Main Engine Processing Facility to facilitate easier access, necessitating their removal from the orbiter)
* if necessary, removal of the Orbital Maneuvering System and Reaction Control System pods for maintenance at the Hypergol Maintenance Facility
* installation of any mid-life upgrades and modifications

==Space Shuttle program==

The Space Shuttle flew from April 12, 1981, until July 21, 2011. Throughout the program, the Space Shuttle had 135 missions, of which 133 returned safely. Throughout its lifetime, the Space Shuttle was used to conduct scientific research, deploy commercial, military, and scientific payloads, and was involved in the construction and operation of Mir and the ISS. During its tenure, the Space Shuttle served as the only U.S. vehicle to launch astronauts, of which there was no replacement until the launch of Crew Dragon Demo-2 on May 30, 2020.

===Budget===
The overall NASA budget of the Space Shuttle program has been estimated to be $221 billion (in 2012 dollars). The developers of the Space Shuttle advocated for reusability as a cost-saving measure, which resulted in higher development costs for presumed lower costs-per-launch. During the design of the Space Shuttle, the Phase B proposals were not as cheap as the initial Phase A estimates indicated; Space Shuttle program manager Robert Thompson acknowledged that reducing cost-per-pound was not the primary objective of the further design phases, as other technical requirements could not be met with the reduced costs. Development estimates made in 1972 projected a per-pound cost of payload as low as $1,109 (in 2012) per pound, but the actual payload costs, not to include the costs for the research and development of the Space Shuttle, were $37,207 (in 2012) per pound. Per-launch costs varied throughout the program and were dependent on the rate of flights as well as research, development, and investigation proceedings throughout the Space Shuttle program. In 1982, NASA published an estimate of $260 million (in 2012) per flight, which was based on the prediction of 24 flights per year for a decade. The per-launch cost from 1995 to 2002, when the orbiters and ISS were not being constructed and there was no recovery work following a loss of crew, was $806 million. NASA published a study in 1999 that concluded that costs were $576 million (in 2012) if there were seven launches per year. In 2009, NASA determined that the cost of adding a single launch per year was $252 million (in 2012), which indicated that much of the Space Shuttle program costs are for year-round personnel and operations that continued regardless of the launch rate. Accounting for the entire Space Shuttle program budget, the per-launch cost was $1.642 billion (in 2012).

===Disasters===
On January 28, 1986, STS-51-L disintegrated 73 seconds after launch, due to the failure of the right SRB, killing all seven astronauts on board &quot;Challenger&quot;. The disaster was caused by the low-temperature impairment of an O-ring, a mission-critical seal used between segments of the SRB casing. Failure of the O-ring allowed hot combustion gases to escape from between the booster sections and burn through the adjacent ET, leading to a sequence of catastrophic events which caused the orbiter to disintegrate. Repeated warnings from design engineers voicing concerns about the lack of evidence of the O-rings&#x27; safety when the temperature was below had been ignored by NASA managers.

On February 1, 2003, &quot;Columbia&quot; disintegrated during re-entry, killing all seven of the STS-107 crew, because of damage to the carbon-carbon leading edge of the wing caused during launch. Ground control engineers had made three separate requests for high-resolution images taken by the Department of Defense that would have provided an understanding of the extent of the damage, while NASA&#x27;s chief TPS engineer requested that astronauts on board &quot;Columbia&quot; be allowed to leave the vehicle to inspect the damage. NASA managers intervened to stop the Department of Defense&#x27;s imaging of the orbiter and refused the request for the spacewalk, and thus the feasibility of scenarios for astronaut repair or rescue by &quot;Atlantis&quot; were not considered by NASA management at the time.

===Criticism===
The partial reusability of the Space Shuttle was one of the primary design requirements during its initial development. The technical decisions that dictated the orbiter&#x27;s return and re-use reduced the per-launch payload capabilities. The original intention was to compensate for this lower payload by lowering the per-launch costs and a high launch frequency. However, the actual costs of a Space Shuttle launch were higher than initially predicted, and the Space Shuttle did not fly the intended 24 missions per year as initially predicted by NASA.

The Space Shuttle was originally intended as a launch vehicle to deploy satellites, which it was primarily used for on the missions prior to the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster. NASA&#x27;s pricing, which was below cost, was lower than expendable launch vehicles; the intention was that the high volume of Space Shuttle missions would compensate for early financial losses. The improvement of expendable launch vehicles and the transition away from commercial payloads on the Space Shuttle resulted in expendable launch vehicles becoming the primary deployment option for satellites. A key customer for the Space Shuttle was the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) responsible for spy satellites. The existence of NRO&#x27;s connection was classified through 1993, and secret considerations of NRO payload requirements led to lack of transparency in the program. The proposed Shuttle-Centaur program, cancelled in the wake of the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, would have pushed the spacecraft beyond its operational capacity.

The fatal &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;Columbia&quot; disasters demonstrated the safety risks of the Space Shuttle that could result in the loss of the crew. The spaceplane design of the orbiter limited the abort options, as the abort scenarios required the controlled flight of the orbiter to a runway or to allow the crew to egress individually, rather than the abort escape options on the Apollo and Soyuz space capsules. Early safety analyses advertised by NASA engineers and management predicted the chance of a catastrophic failure resulting in the death of the crew as ranging from 1 in 100 launches to as rare as 1 in 100,000. Following the loss of two Space Shuttle missions, the risks for the initial missions were reevaluated, and the chance of a catastrophic loss of the vehicle and crew was found to be as high as 1 in 9. NASA management was criticized afterwards for accepting increased risk to the crew in exchange for higher mission rates. Both the &quot;Challenger&quot; and &quot;Columbia &quot; reports explained that NASA culture had failed to keep the crew safe by not objectively evaluating the potential risks of the missions.

=== Retirement ===

The Space Shuttle retirement was announced in January 2004. President George W. Bush announced his Vision for Space Exploration, which called for the retirement of the Space Shuttle once it completed construction of the ISS. To ensure the ISS was properly assembled, the contributing partners determined the need for 16 remaining assembly missions in March 2006. One additional Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission was approved in October 2006. Originally, STS-134 was to be the final Space Shuttle mission. However, the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster resulted in additional orbiters being prepared for launch on need in the event of a rescue mission. As &quot;Atlantis&quot; was prepared for the final launch-on-need mission, the decision was made in September 2010 that it would fly as STS-135 with a four-person crew that could remain at the ISS in the event of an emergency. STS-135 launched on July 8, 2011, and landed at the KSC on July 21, 2011, at 5:57 a.m. EDT (09:57 UTC). From then until the launch of Crew Dragon Demo-2 on May 30, 2020, the US launched its astronauts aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft.

Following each orbiter&#x27;s final flight, it was processed to make it safe for display. The OMS and RCS systems used presented the primary dangers due to their toxic hypergolic propellant, and most of their components were permanently removed to prevent any dangerous outgassing. &quot;Atlantis&quot; is on display at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida, &quot;Discovery&quot; is on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia, &quot;Endeavour&quot; is on display at the California Science Center in Los Angeles, and &quot;Enterprise&quot; is displayed at the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum in New York. Components from the orbiters were transferred to the US Air Force, ISS program, and Russian and Canadian governments. The engines were removed to be used on the Space Launch System, and spare RS-25 nozzles were attached for display purposes.

<doc id="28191" wikidata="Q7561" url="?curid=28191" title="Snow">
<text>Snow consists of individual ice crystals that grow while suspended in the atmosphere—usually within clouds—and then fall, accumulating on the ground where they undergo further changes. It consists of frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide, or sublimate away.

Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take on a variety of shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns, and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation, and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.

Major snow-prone areas include the polar regions, the northernmost half of the Northern Hemisphere, and mountainous regions worldwide with sufficient moisture and cold temperatures. In the Southern Hemisphere, snow is confined primarily to mountainous areas, apart from Antarctica.

Snow affects such human activities as transportation: creating the need for keeping roadways, wings, and windows clear; agriculture: providing water to crops and safeguarding livestock; sports such as skiing, snowboarding, and snowmachine travel; and warfare. Snow affects ecosystems, as well, by providing an insulating layer during winter under which plants and animals are able to survive the cold.

==Precipitation==

Snow develops in clouds that themselves are part of a larger weather system. The physics of snow crystal development in clouds results from a complex set of variables that include moisture content and temperatures. The resulting shapes of the falling and fallen crystals can be classified into a number of basic shapes and combinations thereof. Occasionally, some plate-like, dendritic and stellar-shaped snowflakes can form under clear sky with a very cold temperature inversion present.

===Cloud formation===
Snow clouds usually occur in the context of larger weather systems, the most important of which is the low-pressure area, which typically incorporate warm and cold fronts as part of their circulation. Two additional and locally productive sources of snow are lake-effect (also sea-effect) storms and elevation effects, especially in mountains.

====Low-pressure areas====

Mid-latitude cyclones are low-pressure areas which are capable of producing anything from cloudiness and mild snow storms to heavy blizzards. During a hemisphere&#x27;s fall, winter, and spring, the atmosphere over continents can be cold enough through the depth of the troposphere to cause snowfall. In the Northern Hemisphere, the northern side of the low-pressure area produces the most snow. For the southern mid-latitudes, the side of a cyclone that produces the most snow is the southern side.

====Fronts====
A cold front, the leading edge of a cooler mass of air, can produce frontal snowsqualls—an intense frontal convective line (similar to a rainband), when temperature is near freezing at the surface. The strong convection that develops has enough moisture to produce whiteout conditions at places which the line passes over as the wind causes intense blowing snow. This type of snowsquall generally lasts less than 30 minutes at any point along its path, but the motion of the line can cover large distances. Frontal squalls may form a short distance ahead of the surface cold front or behind the cold front where there may be a deepening low-pressure system or a series of trough lines which act similar to a traditional cold frontal passage. In situations where squalls develop post-frontally, it is not unusual to have two or three linear squall bands pass in rapid succession separated only by , with each passing the same point roughly 30 minutes apart. In cases where there is a large amount of vertical growth and mixing, the squall may develop embedded cumulonimbus clouds resulting in lightning and thunder which is dubbed thundersnow.

A warm front can produce snow for a period as warm, moist air overrides below-freezing air and creates precipitation at the boundary. Often, snow transitions to rain in the warm sector behind the front.

====Lake and ocean effects====

Lake-effect snow is produced during cooler atmospheric conditions when a cold air mass moves across long expanses of warmer lake water, warming the lower layer of air which picks up water vapor from the lake, rises up through the colder air above, freezes, and is deposited on the leeward (downwind) shores.

The same effect occurring over bodies of salt water is termed &quot;ocean-effect&quot; or &quot;bay-effect snow&quot;. The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores. This uplifting can produce narrow but very intense bands of precipitation which may deposit at a rate of many inches of snow each hour, often resulting in a large amount of total snowfall.

The areas affected by lake-effect snow are called snowbelts. These include areas east of the Great Lakes, the west coasts of northern Japan, the Kamchatka Peninsula in Russia, and areas near the Great Salt Lake, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Baltic Sea, and parts of the northern Atlantic Ocean.

====Mountain effects====

Orographic or relief snowfall is created when moist air is forced up the windward side of mountain ranges by a large-scale wind flow. The lifting of moist air up the side of a mountain range results in adiabatic cooling, and ultimately condensation and precipitation. Moisture is gradually removed from the air by this process, leaving drier and warmer air on the descending, or leeward, side. The resulting enhanced snowfall, along with the decrease in temperature with elevation, combine to increase snow depth and seasonal persistence of snowpack in snow-prone areas.

Mountain waves have also been found to help enhance precipitation amounts downwind of mountain ranges by enhancing the lift needed for condensation and precipitation.

===Cloud physics===

A snowflake consists of roughly 1019 water molecules which are added to its core at different rates and in different patterns depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through on its way to the ground. As a result, snowflakes differ from each other though they follow similar patterns.

Snow crystals form when tiny supercooled cloud droplets (about 10 μm in diameter) freeze. These droplets are able to remain liquid at temperatures lower than , because to freeze, a few molecules in the droplet need to get together by chance to form an arrangement similar to that in an ice lattice. The droplet freezes around this &quot;nucleus&quot;. In warmer clouds, an aerosol particle or &quot;ice nucleus&quot; must be present in (or in contact with) the droplet to act as a nucleus. Ice nuclei are very rare compared to cloud condensation nuclei on which liquid droplets form. Clays, desert dust, and biological particles can be nuclei. Artificial nuclei include particles of silver iodide and dry ice, and these are used to stimulate precipitation in cloud seeding.

Once a droplet has frozen, it grows in the supersaturated environment—one where air is saturated with respect to ice when the temperature is below the freezing point. The droplet then grows by diffusion of water molecules in the air (vapor) onto the ice crystal surface where they are collected. Because water droplets are so much more numerous than the ice crystals, the crystals are able to grow to hundreds of micrometers or millimeters in size at the expense of the water droplets by the Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen process. These large crystals are an efficient source of precipitation, since they fall through the atmosphere due to their mass, and may collide and stick together in clusters, or aggregates. These aggregates are snowflakes, and are usually the type of ice particle that falls to the ground. Although the ice is clear, scattering of light by the crystal facets and hollows/imperfections mean that the crystals often appear white in color due to diffuse reflection of the whole spectrum of light by the small ice particles.

===Classification of snowflakes===

Micrography of thousands of snowflakes from 1885 onward, starting with Wilson Alwyn Bentley, revealed the wide diversity of snowflakes within a classifiable set of patterns. Closely matching snow crystals have been observed.

Ukichiro Nakaya developed a crystal morphology diagram, relating crystal shapes to the temperature and moisture conditions under which they formed, which is summarized in the following table.

Nakaya discovered that the shape is also a function of whether the prevalent moisture is above or below saturation. Forms below the saturation line tend more toward solid and compact while crystals formed in supersaturated air tend more toward lacy, delicate, and ornate. Many more complex growth patterns also form, which include side-planes, bullet-rosettes, and planar types, depending on the conditions and ice nuclei. If a crystal has started forming in a column growth regime at around and then falls into the warmer plate-like regime, plate or dendritic crystals sprout at the end of the column, producing so called &quot;capped columns&quot;.

Magono and Lee devised a classification of freshly formed snow crystals that includes 80 distinct shapes. They documented each with micrographs.

==Accumulation==

Snow accumulates from a series of snow events, punctuated by freezing and thawing, over areas that are cold enough to retain snow seasonally or perennially. Major snow-prone areas include the Arctic and Antarctic, the Northern Hemisphere, and alpine regions. The liquid equivalent of snowfall may be evaluated using a snow gauge or with a standard rain gauge, adjusted for winter by removal of a funnel and inner cylinder. Both types of gauges melt the accumulated snow and report the amount of water collected. At some automatic weather stations an ultrasonic snow depth sensor may be used to augment the precipitation gauge.

===Event===
Snow flurry, snow shower, snow storm and blizzard describe snow events of progressively greater duration and intensity. A blizzard is a weather condition involving snow and has varying definitions in different parts of the world. In the United States, a blizzard occurs when two conditions are met for a period of three hours or more: a sustained wind or frequent gusts to , and sufficient snow in the air to reduce visibility to less than . In Canada and the United Kingdom, the criteria are similar. While heavy snowfall often occurs during blizzard conditions, falling snow is not a requirement, as blowing snow can create a ground blizzard.

Snowstorm intensity may be categorized by visibility and depth of accumulation. Snowfall&#x27;s intensity is determined by visibility, as follows:
* &quot;Light&quot;: visibility greater than 
* &quot;Moderate&quot;: visibility restrictions between 
* &quot;Heavy&quot;: visibility is less than 
Snowsqualls may deposit snow in bands that extend from bodies of water as lake-event weather or result from the passage of an upper-level front.&lt;ref name=&quot;popsci/nasa-snowstorm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;weather/bandedsnowfall&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nbcmontana/snow-bands&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground&quot; defines &quot;height of new snow&quot; as the depth of freshly fallen snow, in centimeters as measured with a ruler, that accumulated on a snowboard during an observation period of 24 hours, or other observation interval. After the measurement, the snow is cleared from the board and the board is placed flush with the snow surface to provide an accurate measurement at the end of the next interval. Melting, compacting, blowing and drifting contribute to the difficulty of measuring snowfall.

===Distribution===

Glaciers with their permanent snowpacks cover about 10% of the earth&#x27;s surface, while seasonal snow covers about nine percent, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, where seasonal snow covers about , according to a 1987 estimate. A 2007 estimate of snow cover over the Northern Hemisphere suggested that, on average, snow cover ranges from a minimum extent of each August to a maximum extent of each January or nearly half of the land surface in that hemisphere. A study of Northern Hemisphere snow cover extent for the period 1972–2006 suggests a reduction of over the 35-year period.

===Records===
The following are world records regarding snowfall and snowflakes:
* &quot;Highest seasonal total snowfall&quot; – The world record for the highest seasonal total snowfall was measured in the United States at Mt. Baker Ski Area, outside of the city of Bellingham, Washington during the 1998–1999 season. Mount Baker received of snow, thus surpassing the previous record holder, Mount Rainier, Washington, which during the 1971–1972 season received of snow.
* &quot;Highest seasonal average annual snowfall&quot; – The world record for the highest average annual snowfall is , measured in Sukayu Onsen, Japan for the period of 1981–2010.
* &quot;Largest snowflake&quot; – According to &quot;Guinness World Records,&quot; the world&#x27;s largest snowflake fell in January 1887 outside present-day Miles City, Montana. It measured in diameter.

The cities (more than 100,000 inhabitants) with the highest annual snowfall are Aomori (792 cm), Sapporo (485 cm) and Toyama (363 cm) in Japan, followed by St. John&#x27;s (332 cm) and Quebec City (315 cm) in Canada, and Syracuse, NY (325 cm).

==Metamorphism==
According to the International Association of Cryospheric Sciences, &quot;snow metamorphism&quot; is &quot;the transformation that the snow undergoes in the period from deposition to either melting or passage to glacial ice&quot;. Starting as a powdery deposition, snow becomes more granular when it begins to compact under its own weight, be blown by the wind, sinter particles together and commence the cycle of melting and refreezing. Water vapor plays a role as it deposits ice crystals, known as hoar frost, during cold, still conditions. During this transition, snow &quot;is a highly porous, sintered material made up of a continuous ice structure and a continuously connected pore space, forming together the snow microstructure&quot;. Almost always near its melting temperature, a snowpack is continually transforming these properties wherein all three phases of water may coexist, including liquid water partially filling the pore space. After deposition, snow progresses on one of two paths that determine its fate, either by &quot;ablation&quot; (mostly by melting) from a snow fall or seasonal snowpack, or by transitioning from firn (multi-year snow) into &quot;glacier ice&quot;.

===Seasonal===

Over the course of time, a snowpack may settle under its own weight until its density is approximately 30% of water. Increases in density above this initial compression occur primarily by melting and refreezing, caused by temperatures above freezing or by direct solar radiation. In colder climates, snow lies on the ground all winter. By late spring, snow densities typically reach a maximum of 50% of water. Snow that persists into summer evolves into névé, granular snow, which has been partially melted, refrozen and compacted. Névé has a minimum density of , which is roughly half of the density of liquid water.

===Firn===
Firn is snow that has persisted for multiple years and has been recrystallized into a substance denser than névé, yet less dense and hard than glacial ice. Firn resembles caked sugar and is very resistant to shovelling. Its density generally ranges from , and it can often be found underneath the snow that accumulates at the head of a glacier. The minimum altitude that firn accumulates on a glacier is called the &quot;firn limit&quot;, &quot;firn line&quot; or &quot;snowline&quot;.

==Movement==
There are four main mechanisms for movement of deposited snow: &quot;drifting&quot; of unsintered snow, &quot;avalanches&quot; of accumulated snow on steep slopes, &quot;snowmelt&quot; during thaw conditions, and the &quot;movement of glaciers&quot; after snow has persisted for multiple years and metamorphosed into glacier ice.

===Drifting===

When powdery snow drifts with the wind from the location where it originally fell, forming deposits with a depth of several meters in isolated locations. After attaching to hillsides, blown snow can evolve into a snow slab, which is an avalanche hazard on steep slopes.

===Avalanche===
An avalanche (also called a snowslide or snowslip) is a rapid flow of snow down a sloping surface. Avalanches are typically triggered in a starting zone from a mechanical failure in the snowpack (slab avalanche) when the forces on the snow exceed its strength but sometimes only with gradually widening (loose snow avalanche). After initiation, avalanches usually accelerate rapidly and grow in mass and volume as they entrain more snow. If the avalanche moves fast enough some of the snow may mix with the air forming a powder snow avalanche, which is a type of gravity current. They occur in three major mechanisms:
* &quot;Slab avalanches&quot; occur in snow that has been deposited, or redeposited by wind. They have the characteristic appearance of a block (slab) of snow cut out from its surroundings by fractures. These account for most back-country fatalities.
* &quot;Powder snow avalanches&quot; result from a deposition of fresh dry powder and generate a powder cloud, which overlies a dense avalanche. They can exceed speeds of , and masses of ; their flows can travel long distances along flat valley bottoms and even uphill for short distances.
* &quot;Wet snow avalanches&quot; are a low-velocity suspension of snow and water, with the flow confined to the surface of the pathway. The low speed of travel is due to the friction between the sliding surface of the pathway and the water saturated flow. Despite the low speed of travel (~), wet snow avalanches are capable of generating powerful destructive forces, due to the large mass, and density.

===Melting===

Many rivers originating in mountainous or high-latitude regions receive a significant portion of their flow from snowmelt. This often makes the river&#x27;s flow highly seasonal resulting in periodic flooding during the spring months and at least in dry mountainous regions like the mountain West of the US or most of Iran and Afghanistan, very low flow for the rest of the year. In contrast, if much of the melt is from glaciated or nearly glaciated areas, the melt continues through the warm season, with peak flows occurring in mid to late summer.

===Glaciers===

Glaciers form where the accumulation of snow and ice exceeds ablation. The area in which an alpine glacier forms is called a cirque (corrie or cwm), a typically armchair-shaped geological feature, which collects snow and where the snowpack compacts under the weight of successive layers of accumulating snow, forming névé. Further crushing of the individual snow crystals and reduction of entrapped air in the snow turns it into glacial ice. This glacial ice will fill the cirque until it overflows through a geological weakness or an escape route, such as the gap between two mountains. When the mass of snow and ice is sufficiently thick, it begins to move due to a combination of surface slope, gravity and pressure. On steeper slopes, this can occur with as little as of snow-ice.

==Science==

Scientists study snow at a wide variety of scales that include the physics of chemical bonds and clouds; the distribution, accumulation, metamorphosis, and ablation of snowpacks; and the contribution of snowmelt to river hydraulics and ground hydrology. In doing so, they employ a variety of instruments to observe and measure the phenomena studied. Their findings contribute to knowledge applied by engineers, who adapt vehicles and structures to snow, by agronomists, who address the availability of snowmelt to agriculture, and those, who design equipment for sporting activities on snow. Scientists develop and others employ snow classification systems that describe its physical properties at scales ranging from the individual crystal to the aggregated snowpack. A sub-specialty is avalanches, which are of concern to engineers and outdoors sports people, alike.

Snow science addresses how snow forms, its distribution, and processes affecting how snowpacks change over time. Scientists improve storm forecasting, study global snow cover and its effect on climate, glaciers, and water supplies around the world. The study includes physical properties of the material as it changes, bulk properties of in-place snow packs, and the aggregate properties of regions with snow cover. In doing so, they employ on-the-ground physical measurement techniques to establish ground truth and remote sensing techniques to develop understanding of snow-related processes over large areas.

===Measurement and classification===

In the field snow scientists often excavate a snow pit within which to make basic measurements and observations. Observations can describe features caused by wind, water percolation, or snow unloading from trees. Water percolation into a snowpack can create flow fingers and ponding or flow along capillary barriers, which can refreeze into horizontal and vertical solid ice formations within the snowpack. Among the measurements of the properties of snowpacks that the &quot;International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground&quot; includes are: snow height, snow water equivalent, snow strength, and extent of snow cover. Each has a designation with code and detailed description. The classification extends the prior classifications of Nakaya and his successors to related types of precipitation and are quoted in the following table:
&quot;All are formed in cloud, except for rime, which forms on objects exposed to supercooled moisture.&quot;

It also has a more extensive classification of deposited snow than those that pertain to airborne snow. The categories include both natural and man-made snow types, descriptions of snow crystals as they metamorphose and melt, the development of hoar frost in the snow pack and the formation of ice therein. Each such layer of a snowpack differs from the adjacent layers by one or more characteristics that describe its microstructure or density, which together define the snow type, and other physical properties. Thus, at any one time, the type and state of the snow forming a layer have to be defined because its physical and mechanical properties depend on them. Physical properties include microstructure, grain size and shape, snow density, liquid water content, and temperature.

When it comes to measuring snow cover on the ground, typically three variables are measured: the snow cover extent (SCE) — the land area covered by snow, snow cover duration (SD) — how long a particular area is covered by snow, and the snow accumulation, often expressed as snow water equivalent (SWE), which expresses how much water the snow would be if it were all melted: this last one is a measurement of the volume of the snowpack. To measure these variables a variety of techniques are used: surface observations, remote sensing, land surface models and reanalysis products. These techniques are often combined to form the most complete datasets.

===Satellite data===
Remote sensing of snowpacks with satellites and other platforms typically includes multi-spectral collection of imagery. Multi-faceted interpretation of the data obtained allows inferences about what is observed. The science behind these remote observations has been verified with ground-truth studies of the actual conditions.

Satellite observations record a decrease in snow-covered areas since the 1960s, when satellite observations began. In some regions such as China, a trend of increasing snow cover was observed from 1978 to 2006. These changes are attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less coverage area. In some areas, snow depth increases because of higher temperatures in latitudes north of 40°. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow-cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3% per decade.

The most frequently used methods to map and measure snow extent, snow depth and snow water equivalent employ multiple inputs on the visible–infrared spectrum to deduce the presence and properties of snow. The National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses the reflectance of visible and infrared radiation to calculate a normalized difference snow index, which is a ratio of radiation parameters that can distinguish between clouds and snow. Other researchers have developed decision trees, employing the available data to make more accurate assessments. One challenge to this assessment is where snow cover is patchy, for example during periods of accumulation or ablation and also in forested areas. Cloud cover inhibits optical sensing of surface reflectance, which has led to other methods for estimating ground conditions underneath clouds. For hydrological models, it is important to have continuous information about the snow cover. Passive microwave sensors are especially valuable for temporal and spatial continuity because they can map the surface beneath clouds and in darkness. When combined with reflective measurements, passive microwave sensing greatly extends the inferences possible about the snowpack.

Satellite measurements show that snow cover has been decreasing in many areas of the world since 1978.

===Models===

Snow science often leads to predictive models that include snow deposition, snow melt, and snow hydrology—elements of the Earth&#x27;s water cycle—which help describe global climate change.

Global climate change models (GCMs) incorporate snow as a factor in their calculations. Some important aspects of snow cover include its albedo (reflectivity of incident radiation, including light) and insulating qualities, which slow the rate of seasonal melting of sea ice. As of 2011, the melt phase of GCM snow models were thought to perform poorly in regions with complex factors that regulate snow melt, such as vegetation cover and terrain. These models typically derive snow water equivalent (SWE) in some manner from satellite observations of snow cover. The &quot;International Classification for Seasonal Snow on the Ground&quot; defines SWE as &quot;the depth of water that would result if the mass of snow melted completely&quot;.

Given the importance of snowmelt to agriculture, hydrological runoff models that include snow in their predictions address the phases of accumulating snowpack, melting processes, and distribution of the meltwater through stream networks and into the groundwater. Key to describing the melting processes are solar heat flux, ambient temperature, wind, and precipitation. Initial snowmelt models used a degree-day approach that emphasized the temperature difference between the air and the snowpack to compute snow water equivalent, SWE. More recent models use an energy balance approach that take into account the following factors to compute &quot;Qm&quot;, the energy available for melt. This requires measurement of an array of snowpack and environmental factors to compute six heat flow mechanisms that contribute to &quot;Qm&quot;.

==Effects on civilization==
Snow routinely affects civilization in four major areas, transportation, agriculture, structures, and sports. Most transportation modes are impeded by snow on the travel surface. Agriculture often relies on snow as a source of seasonal moisture. Structures may fail under snow loads. Humans find a wide variety of recreational activities in snowy landscapes. It also affects the conduct of warfare.

===Transportation===

Snow affects the rights of way of highways, airfields and railroads. The snowplow is common to all workers, though roadways take anti-icing chemicals to prevent bonding of ice and airfields may not; railroads rely on abrasives for track traction.

====Highway====
In the late 20th century, an estimated $2 billion was spent annually in North America on roadway winter maintenance, owing to snow and other winter weather events, according to a 1994 report by Kuemmel. The study surveyed the practices of jurisdictions within 44 US states and nine Canadian provinces. It assessed the policies, practices, and equipment used for winter maintenance. It found similar practices and progress to be prevalent in Europe.

The dominant effect of snow on vehicle contact with the road is diminished friction. This can be improved with the use of snow tires, which have a tread designed to compact snow in a manner that enhances traction. The key to maintaining a roadway that can accommodate traffic during and after a snow event is an effective anti-icing program that employs both chemicals and plowing. The Federal Highway Administration &quot;Manual of Practice for an Effective Anti-icing Program&quot; emphasizes &quot;anti-icing&quot; procedures that prevent the bonding of snow and ice to the road. Key aspects of the practice include: understanding anti-icing in light of the level of service to be achieved on a given roadway, the climatic conditions to be encountered, and the different roles of deicing, anti-icing, and abrasive materials and applications, and employing anti-icing &quot;toolboxes&quot;, one for operations, one for decision-making and another for personnel. The elements to the toolboxes are:
* &quot;Operations&quot; – Addresses the application of solid and liquid chemicals, using various techniques, including prewetting of chloride-salts. It also addresses plowing capability, including types of snowplows and blades used.
* &quot;Decision-making&quot; – Combines weather forecast information with road information to assess the upcoming needs for application of assets and the evaluation of treatment effectiveness with operations underway.
* &quot;Personnel&quot; – Addresses training and deployment of staff to effectively execute the anti-icing program, using the appropriate materials, equipment and procedures.
The manual offers matrices that address different types of snow and the rate of snowfall to tailor applications appropriately and efficiently.

Snow fences, constructed upwind of roadways control snow drifting by causing windblown, drifting snow to accumulate in a desired place. They are also used on railways. Additionally, farmers and ranchers use snow fences to create drifts in basins for a ready supply of water in the spring.

====Aviation====
In order to keep airports open during winter storms, runways and taxiways require snow removal. Unlike roadways, where chloride chemical treatment is common to prevent snow from bonding to the pavement surface, such chemicals are typically banned from airports because of their strong corrosive effect on aluminum aircraft. Consequently, mechanical brushes are often used to complement the action of snow plows. Given the width of runways on airfields that handle large aircraft, vehicles with large plow blades, an echelon of plow vehicles or rotary snowplows are used to clear snow on runways and taxiways. Terminal aprons may require or more to be cleared.

Properly equipped aircraft are able to fly through snowstorms under instrument flight rules. Prior to takeoff, during snowstorms they require deicing fluid to prevent accumulation and freezing of snow and other precipitation on wings and fuselages, which may compromise the safety of the aircraft and its occupants. In flight, aircraft rely on a variety of mechanisms to avoid rime and other types of icing in clouds, these include pulsing pneumatic boots, electro-thermal areas that generate heat, and fluid deicers that bleed onto the surface.

====Rail====
Railroads have traditionally employed two types of snow plows for clearing track, the wedge plow, which casts snow to both sides, and the rotary snowplow, which is suited for addressing heavy snowfall and casting snow far to one side or the other. Prior to the invention of the rotary snowplow ca. 1865, it required multiple locomotives to drive a wedge plow through deep snow. Subsequent to clearing the track with such plows, a &quot;flanger&quot; is used to clear snow from between the rails that are below the reach of the other types of plow. Where icing may affect the steel-to-steel contact of locomotive wheels on track, abrasives (typically sand) have been used to provide traction on steeper uphills.

Railroads employ snow sheds—structures that cover the track—to prevent the accumulation of heavy snow or avalanches to cover tracks in snowy mountainous areas, such as the Alps and the Rocky Mountains.
====Construction====
Snow can be compacted to form a snow road and be part of a winter road route for vehicles to access isolated communities or construction projects during the winter. Snow can also be used to provide the supporting structure and surface for a runway, as with the Phoenix Airfield in Antarctica. The snow-compacted runway is designed to withstand approximately 60 wheeled flights of heavy-lift military aircraft a year.

===Agriculture===

Snowfall can be beneficial to agriculture by serving as a thermal insulator, conserving the heat of the Earth and protecting crops from subfreezing weather. Some agricultural areas depend on an accumulation of snow during winter that will melt gradually in spring, providing water for crop growth, both directly and via runoff through streams and rivers, which supply irrigation canals. The following are examples of rivers that rely on meltwater from glaciers or seasonal snowpack as an important part of their flow on which irrigation depends: the Ganges, many of whose tributaries rise in the Himalayas and which provide much irrigation in northeast India, the Indus River, which rises in Tibet and provides irrigation water to Pakistan from rapidly retreating Tibetan glaciers, and the Colorado River, which receives much of its water from seasonal snowpack in the Rocky Mountains and provides irrigation water to some .

===Structures===

Snow is an important consideration for loads on structures. To address these, European countries employ &quot;Eurocode 1: Actions on structures - Part 1-3: General actions - Snow loads&quot;. In North America, ASCE &quot;Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures&quot; gives guidance on snow loads. Both standards employ methods that translate maximum expected ground snow loads onto design loads for roofs.

====Roofs====

Snow loads and icings are two principal issues for roofs. Snow loads are related to the climate in which a structure is sited. Icings are usually a result of the building or structure generating heat that melts the snow that is on it.

&quot;Snow loads&quot; – The &quot;Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures&quot; gives guidance on how to translate the following factors into roof snow loads:
* Ground snow loads
* Exposure of the roof
* Thermal properties of the roof
* Shape of the roof
* Drifting
* Importance of the building
It gives tables for ground snow loads by region and a methodology for computing ground snow loads that may vary with elevation from nearby, measured values. The &quot;Eurocode 1&quot; uses similar methodologies, starting with ground snow loads that are tabulated for portions of Europe.

&quot;Icings&quot; – Roofs must also be designed to avoid ice dams, which result from meltwater running under the snow on the roof and freezing at the eave. Ice dams on roofs form when accumulated snow on a sloping roof melts and flows down the roof, under the insulating blanket of snow, until it reaches below freezing temperature air, typically at the eaves. When the meltwater reaches the freezing air, ice accumulates, forming a dam, and snow that melts later cannot drain properly through the dam. Ice dams may result in damaged building materials or in damage or injury when the ice dam falls off or from attempts to remove ice dams. The melting results from heat passing through the roof under the highly insulating layer of snow.

====Utility lines====
In areas with trees, utility distribution lines on poles are less susceptible to snow loads than they are subject to damage from trees falling on them, felled by heavy, wet snow. Elsewhere, snow can accrete on power lines as &quot;sleeves&quot; of rime ice. Engineers design for such loads, which are measured in kg/m (lb/ft) and power companies have forecasting systems that anticipate types of weather that may cause such accretions. Rime ice may be removed manually or by creating a sufficient short circuit in the affected segment of power lines to melt the accretions.

===Sports and recreation===
Snow figures into many winter sports and forms of recreation, including skiing and sledding. Common examples include cross-country skiing, Alpine skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, and snowmobiling. The design of the equipment used, e.g. skis and snowboards, typically relies on the bearing strength of snow and contends with the coefficient of friction bearing on snow.

Skiing is by far the largest form of winter recreation. As of 1994, of the estimated 65–75 million skiers worldwide, there were approximately 55 million who engaged in Alpine skiing, the rest engaged in cross-country skiing. Approximately 30 million skiers (of all kinds) were in Europe, 15 million in the US, and 14 million in Japan. As of 1996, there were reportedly 4,500 ski areas, operating 26,000 ski lifts and enjoying 390 million skier visits per year. The preponderant region for downhill skiing was Europe, followed by Japan and the US.

Increasingly, ski resorts are relying on snowmaking, the production of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a snow gun on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. Wet-bulb temperature is used as a metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use.

Ski wax enhances the ability of a ski (or other runner) to slide over snow by reducing its coefficient of friction, which depends on both the properties of the snow and the ski to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the ski interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the ski. Before a ski can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the ski is moving over the snow.

===Warfare===
Snow affects warfare conducted in winter, alpine environments or at high latitudes. The main factors are &quot;impaired visibility&quot; for acquiring targets during falling snow, &quot;enhanced visibility&quot; of targets against snowy backgrounds for targeting, and mobility for both mechanized and infantry troops. Snowfall can severely inhibit the logistics of supplying troops, as well. Snow can also provide cover and fortification against small-arms fire. Noted winter warfare campaigns where snow and other factors affected the operations include:
* The French invasion of Russia, where poor traction conditions for ill-shod horses made it difficult for supply wagons to keep up with troops. That campaign was also strongly affected by cold, whereby the retreating army reached Neman River in December 1812 with only 10,000 of the 420,000 that had set out to invade Russia in June of the same year.
* The Winter War, an attempt by the Soviet Union to take territory in Finland in late 1939 demonstrated superior winter tactics of the Finnish Army, regarding over-snow mobility, camouflage, and use of the terrain.
* The Battle of the Bulge, a German counteroffensive during World War II, starting December 16, 1944, was marked by heavy snowstorms that hampered allied air support for ground troops, but also impaired German attempts to supply their front lines. On the Eastern Front with the Nazi invasion of Russia in 1941, Operation Barbarossa, both Russian and German soldiers had to endure terrible conditions during the Russian winter. While use of ski infantry was common in the Red Army, Germany formed only one division for movement on skis.
* The Korean War which lasted from June 25, 1950, until an armistice on July 27, 1953, began when North Korea invaded South Korea. Much of the fighting occurred during winter conditions, involving snow, notably during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, which was a stark example of cold affecting military operations, especially vehicles and weapons.
==Effects on plants and animals==

Plants and animals endemic to snowbound areas develop ways to adapt. Among the adaptive mechanisms for plants are freeze-adaptive chemistry, dormancy, seasonal dieback, survival of seeds; and for animals are hibernation, insulation, anti-freeze chemistry, storing food, drawing on reserves from within the body, and clustering for mutual heat.

Snow interacts with vegetation in two principal ways, vegetation can influence the deposition and retention of snow and, conversely, the presence of snow can affect the distribution and growth of vegetation. Tree branches, especially of conifers intercept falling snow and prevent accumulation on the ground. Snow suspended in trees ablates more rapidly than that on the ground, owing to its greater exposure to sun and air movement. Trees and other plants can also promote snow retention on the ground, which would otherwise be blown elsewhere or melted by the sun. Snow affects vegetation in several ways, the presence of stored water can promote growth, yet the annual onset of growth is dependent on the departure of the snowpack for those plants that are buried beneath it. Furthermore, avalanches and erosion from snowmelt can scour terrain of vegetation.
Snow supports a wide variety of animals both on the surface and beneath. Many invertebrates thrive in snow, including spiders, wasps, beetles, snow scorpionflies and springtails. Such arthropods are typically active at temperatures down to . Invertebrates fall into two groups, regarding surviving subfreezing temperatures: freezing resistant and those that avoid freezing because they are freeze-sensitive. The first group may be cold hardy owing to the ability to produce antifreeze agents in their body fluids that allows survival of long exposure to sub-freezing conditions. Some organisms fast during the winter, which expels freezing-sensitive contents from their digestive tracts. The ability to survive the absence of oxygen in ice is an additional survival mechanism.

Small vertebrates are active beneath the snow. Among vertebrates, alpine salamanders are active in snow at temperatures as low as ; they burrow to the surface in springtime and lay their eggs in melt ponds. Among mammals, those that remain active are typically smaller than . Omnivores are more likely to enter a torpor or be hibernators, whereas herbivores are more likely to maintain food caches beneath the snow. Voles store up to of food and pikas up to . Voles also huddle in communal nests to benefit from one another&#x27;s warmth. On the surface, wolves, coyotes, foxes, lynx, and weasels rely on these subsurface dwellers for food and often dive into the snowpack to find them.

== Outside of Earth ==
Extraterrestrial &quot;snow&quot; includes water-based precipitation, but also precipitation of other compounds prevalent on other planets and moons in the Solar System. Examples are:
* On Mars, observations of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; Mars lander revealed that water-based snow crystals occur at high latitudes. Additionally, carbon dioxide precipitates from clouds during the Martian winters at the poles and contributes to a seasonal deposit of that compound, which is the principal component of that planet&#x27;s ice caps.
* On Venus, observations from the &quot;Magellan&quot; spacecraft revealed the presence a metallic substance, which precipitates as &quot;Venus snow&quot; and leaves a highly reflective substance at the tops of Venus&#x27;s highest mountain peaks resembling terrestrial snow. Given the high temperatures on Venus, the leading candidates for the precipitate are lead sulfide and bismuth(III) sulfide.
* On Saturn&#x27;s moon, Titan, &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; spacecraft observations suggested the presence of methane or some other form of hydrocarbon-based crystalline deposits.
* On Pluto, New Horizons&#x27; observations showed that methane condenses at high altitude and falls down as frost.

<text>Symbolics, Inc., was a privately held American computer manufacturer that acquired the assets of the former company and continues to sell and maintain the Open Genera Lisp system and the Macsyma computer algebra system.
The symbolics.com domain was originally registered on March 15, 1985, making it the first .com-domain in the world. In August 2009, it was sold to napkin.com (formerly XF.com) Investments.

== History ==
Symbolics, Inc. was a computer manufacturer headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and later in Concord, Massachusetts, with manufacturing facilities in Chatsworth, California (a suburban section of Los Angeles). Its first CEO, chairman, and founder was Russell Noftsker. Symbolics designed and manufactured a line of Lisp machines, single-user computers optimized to run the programming language Lisp. Symbolics also made significant advances in software technology, and offered one of the premier software development environments of the 1980s and 1990s, now sold commercially as Open Genera for Tru64 UNIX on the Hewlett-Packard (HP) Alpha. The Lisp Machine was the first commercially available &quot;workstation&quot;, although that word had not yet been coined.

Symbolics was a spinoff from the MIT AI Lab, one of two companies to be founded by AI Lab staffers and associated hackers for the purpose of manufacturing Lisp machines. The other was Lisp Machines, Inc., although Symbolics attracted most of the hackers, and more funding.

Symbolics&#x27; initial product, the LM-2, introduced in 1981, was a repackaged version of the MIT CADR Lisp machine design. The operating system and software development environment, over 500,000 lines, was written in Lisp from the microcode up, based on MIT&#x27;s Lisp Machine Lisp.

The software bundle was later renamed ZetaLisp, to distinguish the Symbolics&#x27; product from other vendors who had also licensed the MIT software. Symbolics&#x27; Zmacs text editor, a variant of Emacs, was implemented in a text-processing package named &quot;ZWEI&quot;, an acronym for &quot;Zwei was Eine initially&quot;, with &quot;Eine&quot; being an acronym for &quot;Eine Is Not Emacs&quot;. Both are recursive acronyms and puns on the German words for &quot;one&quot; (&quot;eins&quot;, &quot;eine&quot;) and &quot;two&quot; (&quot;zwei&quot;).

The Lisp Machine system software was then copyrighted by MIT, and was licensed to both Symbolics and LMI. Until 1981, Symbolics shared all its copyrighted enhancements to the source code with MIT and kept it on an MIT server. According to Richard Stallman, Symbolics engaged in a business tactic in which it forced MIT to make all Symbolics&#x27; copyrighted fixes and improvements to the Lisp Machine OS available only to Symbolics (and MIT but not to Symbolics competitors), and thereby choke off its competitor LMI, which at that time had insufficient resources to independently maintain or develop the OS and environment.

Symbolics felt that they no longer had sufficient control over their product. At that point, Symbolics began using their own copy of the software, located on their company servers, while Stallman says that Symbolics did that to prevent its Lisp improvements from flowing to Lisp Machines, Inc. From that base, Symbolics made extensive improvements to every part of the software, and continued to deliver almost all the source code to their customers (including MIT). However, the policy prohibited MIT staff from distributing the Symbolics version of the software to others. With the end of open collaboration came the end of the MIT hacker community. As a reaction to this, Stallman initiated the GNU project to make a new community. Eventually, Copyleft and the GNU General Public License would ensure that a hacker&#x27;s software could remain free software. In this way, Symbolics played a key, albeit adversarial, role in instigating the free software movement.

===The 3600 series===

In 1983, a year later than planned, Symbolics introduced the 3600 family of Lisp machines. Code-named the &quot;L-machine&quot; internally, the 3600 family was an innovative new design, inspired by the CADR architecture but sharing few of its implementation details. The main processor had a 36-bit word (divided up as 4 or 8 bits of tags, and 32 bits of data or 28 bits of memory address). Memory words were 44 bits, the additional 8 bits being used for error-correcting code (ECC). The instruction set was that of a stack machine. The 3600 architecture provided 4,096 hardware registers, of which half were used as a cache for the top of the control stack; the rest were used by the microcode and time-critical routines of the operating system and Lisp run-time environment. Hardware support was provided for virtual memory, which was common for machines in its class, and for garbage collection, which was unique.

The original 3600 processor was a microprogrammed design like the CADR, and was built on several large circuit boards from standard TTL integrated circuits, both features being common for commercial computers in its class at the time. Central processing unit (CPU) clock speed varied depending on which instruction was being executed, but was typically around 5 MHz. Many Lisp primitives could be executed in a single clock cycle. Disk input/output (I/O) was handled by multitasking at the microcode level. A 68000 processor (termed the &quot;front-end processor&quot;, (FEP)) started the main computer up, and handled the slower peripherals during normal operation. An Ethernet interface was standard equipment, replacing the Chaosnet interface of the LM-2.

The 3600 was roughly the size of a household refrigerator. This was partly due to the size of the processor (the cards were widely spaced to allow wire-wrap prototype cards to fit without interference) and partly due to the size of disk drive technology in the early 1980s. At the 3600&#x27;s introduction, the smallest disk that could support the ZetaLisp software was wide (most 3600s shipped with the 10½-inch Fujitsu Eagle). The 3670 and 3675 were slightly shorter in height, but were essentially the same machine packed a little tighter. The advent of , and later , disk drives that could hold hundreds of megabytes led to the introduction of the 3640 and 3645, which were roughly the size of a two-drawer file cabinet.

Later versions of the 3600 architecture were implemented on custom integrated circuits, reducing the five cards of the original processor design to two, at a large manufacturing cost savings and with performance slightly better than the old design. The 3650, first of the &quot;G machines&quot;, as they were known within the company, was housed in a cabinet derived from the 3640s. Denser memory and smaller disk drives enabled the introduction of the 3620, about the size of a modern full-size tower PC. The 3630 was a &quot;fat 3620&quot; with room for more memory and video interface cards. The 3610 was a lower priced variant of the 3620, essentially identical in every way except that it was licensed for application deployment rather than general development.

The various models of the 3600 family were popular for artificial intelligence (AI) research and commercial applications throughout the 1980s. The AI commercialization boom of the 1980s led directly to Symbolics&#x27; success during the decade. Symbolics computers were widely believed to be the best platform available for developing AI software. The LM-2 used a Symbolics-branded version of the complex space-cadet keyboard, while later models used a simplified version (at right), known simply as the &quot;&quot;. The Symbolics keyboard featured the many modifier keys used in Zmacs, notably Control/Meta/Super/Hyper in a block, but did not feature the complex symbol set of the space-cadet keyboard.

Also contributing to the 3600 series&#x27; success was a line of bit-mapped graphics color video interfaces, combined with extremely powerful animation software. Symbolics&#x27; Graphics Division, headquartered in Westwood, Los Angeles, California, near to the major Hollywood movie and television studios, made its S-Render and S-Paint software into industry leaders in the animation business and its 24 fps lock displays were featured in Star Trek movies.

Symbolics developed the first workstations able to process high-definition television (HDTV) quality video, which enjoyed a popular following in Japan. A 3600, with the standard black-and-white monitor, made a cameo appearance in the movie &quot;Real Genius&quot;. The company was also referenced in Michael Crichton&#x27;s novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

Symbolics&#x27; Graphics Division was sold to Nichimen Trading Company in the early 1990s, and the S-Graphics software suite (S-Paint, S-Geometry, S-Dynamics, S-Render) ported to Franz Allegro Common Lisp on Silicon Graphics (SGI) and PC computers running Windows NT. Today it is sold as Mirai by Izware LLC, and continues to be used in major motion pictures (most famously in New Line Cinema&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;), video games, and military simulations.
Symbolics&#x27; 3600-series computers were also used as the first front end &quot;controller&quot; computers for the Connection Machine massively parallel computers manufactured by Thinking Machines Corporation, another MIT spinoff based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Connection Machine ran a parallel variant of Lisp and, initially, was used primarily by the AI community, so the Symbolics Lisp machine was a particularly good fit as a front-end machine.

For a long time, the operating system didn&#x27;t have a name, but was finally named &quot;Genera&quot; around 1984. The system included several advanced dialects of Lisp. Its heritage was Maclisp on the PDP-10, but it included more data types, and multiple-inheritance object-oriented programming features. This Lisp dialect was called Lisp Machine Lisp at MIT. Symbolics used the name ZetaLisp. Symbolics later wrote new software in &quot;Symbolics Common Lisp&quot;, its version of the Common Lisp standard.

===Ivory and Open Genera===
In the late 1980s (2 years later than planned), the Ivory family of single-chip Lisp Machine processors superseded the G-Machine 3650, 3620, and 3630 systems. The Ivory 390k transistor VLSI implementation designed in Symbolics Common Lisp using NS, a custom Symbolics Hardware Design Language (HDL), addressed a 40-bit word (8 bits tag, 32 bits data/address). Since it only addressed full words and not bytes or half-words, this allowed addressing of 4 Gigawords (GW) or 16 gigabytes (GB) of memory; the increase in address space reflected the growth of programs and data as semiconductor memory and disk space became cheaper. The Ivory processor had 8 bits of ECC attached to each word, so each word fetched from external memory to the chip was actually 48 bits wide. Each Ivory instruction was 18 bits wide and two instructions plus a 2-bit CDR code and 2-bit Data Type were in each instruction word fetched from memory. Fetching two instruction words at a time from memory enhanced the Ivory&#x27;s performance. Unlike the 3600&#x27;s microprogrammed architecture, the Ivory instruction set was still microcoded, but was stored in a 1200 × 180-bit ROM inside the Ivory chip. The initial Ivory processors were fabricated by VLSI Technology Inc in San Jose, California, on a 2 μm CMOS process, with later generations fabricated by Hewlett-Packard in Corvallis, Oregon, on 1.25 μm and 1 μm CMOS processes. The Ivory had a stack architecture and operated a 4-stage pipeline: Fetch, Decode, Execute and Write Back. Ivory processors were marketed in stand-alone Lisp Machines (the XL400, XL1200, and XL1201), headless Lisp Machines (NXP1000), and on add-in cards for Sun Microsystems (UX400, UX1200) and Apple Macintosh (MacIvory I, II, III) computers. The Lisp Machines with Ivory processors operated at speeds that were between two and six times faster than a 3600 depending on the model and the revision of the Ivory chip.

The Ivory instruction set was later emulated in software for microprocessors implementing the 64-bit Alpha architecture. The &quot;Virtual Lisp Machine&quot; emulator, combined with the operating system and software development environment from the XL machines, is sold as Open Genera.

===Sunstone===
Sunstone was a processor similar to a reduced instruction set computer (RISC), that was to be released shortly after the Ivory. It was designed by Ron Lebel&#x27;s group at the Symbolics Westwood office. However, the project was canceled the day it was supposed to tape out.

===Endgame===
As quickly as the commercial AI boom of the mid-1980s had propelled Symbolics to success, the &quot;AI Winter&quot; of the late 1980s and early 1990s, combined with the slowdown of the Ronald Reagan administration&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly termed &quot;Star Wars&quot;, missile defense program, for which the &quot;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency&quot; (DARPA) had invested heavily in AI solutions, severely damaged Symbolics. An internal war between Noftsker and the CEO the board had hired in 1986, Brian Sear, over whether to follow Sun&#x27;s suggested lead and focus on selling their software, or to re-emphasize their superior hardware, and the ensuing lack of focus when both Noftsker and Sear were fired from the company caused sales to plummet. This, combined with some ill-advised real estate deals by company management during the boom years (they had entered into large long-term lease obligations in California), drove Symbolics into bankruptcy. Rapid evolution in mass market microprocessor technology (the &quot;PC revolution&quot;), advances in Lisp compiler technology, and the economics of manufacturing custom microprocessors severely diminished the commercial advantages of purpose-built Lisp machines. By 1995, the Lisp machine era had ended, and with it Symbolics&#x27; hopes for success.

Symbolics continued as an enterprise with very limited revenues, supported mainly by service contracts on the remaining MacIvory, UX-1200, UX-1201, and other machines still used by commercial customers. Symbolics also sold Virtual Lisp Machine (VLM) software for DEC, Compaq, and HP Alpha-based workstations (AlphaStation) and servers (AlphaServer), refurbished MacIvory IIs, and Symbolics keyboards.

In July 2005, Symbolics closed its Chatsworth, California, maintenance facility. The reclusive owner of the company, Andrew Topping, died that same year. The current legal status of Symbolics software is uncertain. An assortment of Symbolics hardware was still available for purchase . In 2011, the United States Department of Defense (US DoD) awarded Symbolics a 5 year contract for maintenance work, ending in September 2016.

===First .com domain===

On March 15, 1985, symbolics.com became the first (and currently, since it is still registered, the oldest) registered domain of the Internet. The symbolics.com domain was purchased by Napkin.com in 2009.

==Networking==
Genera also featured the most extensive networking interoperability software seen to that point. A local area network system called Chaosnet had been invented for the Lisp Machine (predating the commercial availability of Ethernet). The Symbolics system supported Chaosnet, but also had one of the first TCP/IP implementations. It also supported DECnet and IBM&#x27;s SNA network protocols. A Dialnet protocol used phone lines and modems. Genera would, using hints from its distributed &quot;namespace&quot; database (somewhat similar to Domain Name System (DNS), but more comprehensive, like parts of Xerox&#x27;s Grapevine), automatically select the best protocol combination to use when connecting to network service. An application program (or a user command) would only specify the name of the host and the desired service. For example, a host name and a request for &quot;Terminal Connection&quot; might yield a connection over TCP/IP using the Telnet protocol (although there were many other possibilities). Likewise, requesting a file operation (such as a Copy File command) might pick NFS, FTP, NFILE (the Symbolics network file access protocol), or one of several others, and it might execute the request over TCP/IP, Chaosnet, or whatever other network was most suitable.

==Application programs==
The most popular application program for the Symbolics Lisp Machine was the ICAD computer-aided engineering system. One of the first networked multi-player video games, a version of Spacewar, was developed for the Symbolics Lisp Machine in 1983. Electronic CAD software on the Symbolics Lisp Machine was used to develop the first implementation of the Hewlett-Packard Precision Architecture (PA-RISC).

==Contributions to computer science==
Symbolics&#x27; research and development staff (first at MIT, and then later at the company) produced several major innovations in software technology:

*Flavors, one of the earliest object-oriented programming extensions to Lisp, was a message passing object system patterned after Smalltalk, but with multiple inheritance and several other enhancements. The Symbolics operating system made heavy use of Flavors objects. The experience gained with Flavors led to the design of New Flavors, a short-lived successor based on generic functions rather than message passing. Many of the concepts in New Flavors formed the basis of the CLOS (Common Lisp Object System) standard.
*Advances in garbage collection techniques by Henry Baker, David A. Moon and others, particularly the first commercial use of generational scavenging, allowed Symbolics computers to run large Lisp programs for months at a time.
*Symbolics staffers Dan Weinreb, David A. Moon, Neal Feinberg, Kent Pitman, Scott McKay, Sonya Keene, and others made significant contributions to the emerging Common Lisp language standard from the mid-1980s through the release of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Common Lisp standard in 1994.
*Symbolics introduced one of the first commercial object databases, Statice, in 1989. Its developers later went on to found Object Design, Inc. and create ObjectStore.
*Symbolics introduced in 1987 one of the first commercial microprocessors designed to support the execution of Lisp programs: the Symbolics Ivory. Symbolics also used its own CAD system (NS, New Schematic) for the development of the Ivory chip.
*Under contract from AT&amp;T, Symbolics developed Minima, a real-time Lisp run-time environment and operating system for the Ivory processor. This was delivered in a small hardware configuration featuring much random-access memory (RAM), no disk, and dual network ports. It was used as the basis for a next-generation carrier class long-distance telephone switch.
*The Graphics Division&#x27;s Craig Reynolds devised an algorithm that simulated the flocking behavior of birds in flight. &quot;Boids&quot; made their first appearance at SIGGRAPH in the 1987 animated short &quot;Stanley and Stella in: Breaking the Ice&quot;, produced by the Graphics Division. Reynolds went on to win the Scientific And Engineering Award from The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1998.
*The Symbolics Document Examiner hypertext system originally used for the Symbolics manuals- it was based on Zmacs following a design by Janet Walker, and proved influential in the evolution of hypertext.
* Symbolics was very active in the design and development of the Common Lisp Interface Manager (CLIM) presentation-based User Interface Management System. CLIM is a descendant of Dynamic Windows, Symbolics&#x27; own window system. CLIM was the result of the collaboration of several Lisp companies.
* Symbolics produced the first workstation which could genlock, the first to have real time video I/O, the first to support digital video I/O and the first to do HDTV.

==Symbolics Graphics Division==
The Symbolics Graphics Division (SGD, founded in 1982, sold to Nichimen Graphics in 1992) developed the S-Graphics software suite (S-Paint, S-Geometry, S-Dynamics, S-Render) for Symbolics Genera.

===Movies===
This software was also used to create a few computer-animated movies and was used for some popular movies.

* 1984, graphics for the little screens on the bridges of the Enterprise and the Klingon ship in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot;
* 1985, 3D animations for &quot;Real Genius&quot;
* 1987, Symbolics, &quot;Stanley and Stella in: Breaking the Ice&quot;
* 1989, Symbolics, The Little Death
* 1990, 3D animations for &quot;Robocop 2&quot;
* 1990, 3D animations for &quot;&quot;
* 1990, 3D animations for &quot;The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera&quot;
* 1991, Symbolics, &quot;Ductile Flow&quot;, presented at SIGGRAPH 1991 
* 1991, Symbolics, Virtually Yours
* 1991, 3D animations for &quot;An American Tail: Fievel Goes West&quot;
* 1993, 3D animation of the Orca for &quot;Free Willy&quot;

<doc id="28198" wikidata="Q159992" url="?curid=28198" title="Surfing">
<text>Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found as standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or wave pools.

The term &quot;surfing&quot; refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.

Another prominent form of surfing is body boarding, where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats) and using foils. Body surfing, in which the wave is caught and ridden using the surfer&#x27;s own body rather than a board, is very common and is considered by some surfers to be the purest form of surfing. The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit on one hand. Surfers who body board, body surf, or handboard feel more drag as they move through the water than stand up surfers do. This holds body surfers into a more turbulent part of the wave (often completely submerged by whitewater). In contrast, surfers who instead ride a hydrofoil feel substantially less drag and may ride unbroken waves in the open ocean.

Three major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style and the kind of wave that is ridden.

In tow-in surfing (most often, but not exclusively, associated with big wave surfing), a motorized water vehicle such as a personal watercraft, tows the surfer into the wave front, helping the surfer match a large wave&#x27;s speed, which is generally a higher speed than a self-propelled surfer can produce. Surfing-related sports such as paddle boarding and sea kayaking that are self-propelled by hand paddles do not require waves, and other derivative sports such as kite surfing and windsurfing rely primarily on wind for power, yet all of these platforms may also be used to ride waves. Recently with the use of V-drive boats, Wakesurfing, in which one surfs on the wake of a boat, has emerged. As of 2023, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized a wave ride by Sebastian Steudtner at Nazaré, Portugal as the largest wave ever surfed.

During the winter season in the northern hemisphere, the North Shore of Oahu, the third-largest island of Hawaii, is known for having some of the best waves in the world. Surfers from around the world flock to breaks like Backdoor, Waimea Bay, and Pipeline. However, there are still many popular surf spots around the world: Teahupo&#x27;o, located off the coast of Tahiti; Mavericks, California, United States; Cloudbreak, Tavarua Island, Fiji; Superbank, Gold Coast, Australia.

In 2016 surfing was added by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as an Olympic sport to begin at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Japan.
The first gold medalists of the Tokyo 2020 surfing men and women&#x27;s competitions were, respectively, the Brazilian Ítalo Ferreira and the American from Hawaii, Carissa Moore.

==Origins and history==
===Peru===

About three to five thousand years ago, cultures in ancient Peru fished in kayak-like watercraft (&quot;mochica&quot;) made of reeds that the fishermen surfed back to shore. The Moche culture used the caballito de totora (little horse of totora), with archaeological evidence showing its use around 200 CE. An early description of the Inca surfing in Callao was documented by Jesuit missionary José de Acosta in his 1590 publication &quot;Historia natural y moral de las Indias&quot;, writing:

===Polynesia===

In Polynesian culture, surfing was an important activity. Modern surfing as we know it today is thought to have originated in Hawaii. The history of surfing dates to in Polynesia, where Polynesians began to make their way to the Hawaiian Islands from Tahiti and the Marquesas Islands. They brought many of their customs with them including playing in the surf on Paipo (belly/body) boards. It was in Hawaii that the art of standing and surfing upright on boards was invented.

Various European explorers witnessed surfing in Polynesia. Surfing may have been observed by British explorers at Tahiti in 1767. Samuel Wallis and the crew members of were the first Britons to visit the island in June of that year. Another candidate is the botanist Joseph Banks who was part of the first voyage of James Cook on , arriving on Tahiti on 10 April 1769. Lieutenant James King was the first person to write about the art of surfing on Hawaii, when he was completing the journals of Captain James Cook (upon Cook&#x27;s death in 1779).

In Herman Melville&#x27;s 1849 novel &quot;Mardi&quot;, based on his experiences in Polynesia earlier that decade, the narrator describes the &quot;Rare Sport at Ohonoo&quot; (title of chap. 90): “For this sport, a surf-board is indispensable: some five feet in length; the width of a man&#x27;s body; convex on both sides; highly polished; and rounded at the ends. It is held in high estimation; invariably oiled after use; and hung up conspicuously in the dwelling of the owner.” When Mark Twain visited Hawaii in 1866 he wrote, &quot;In one place, we came upon a large company of naked natives of both sexes and all ages, amusing themselves with the national pastime of surf-bathing.&quot;

References to surf riding on planks and single canoe hulls are also verified for pre-contact Samoa, where surfing was called &quot;fa&#x27;ase&#x27;e&quot; or &quot;se&#x27;egalu&quot; (see Augustin Krämer, &quot;The Samoa Islands&quot;), and Tonga, far pre-dating the practice of surfing by Hawaiians and eastern Polynesians by over a thousand years.

===West Africa===

West Africans (e.g., Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Senegal) and western Central Africans (e.g., Cameroon) independently developed the skill of surfing. Amid the 1640s CE, Michael Hemmersam provided an account of surfing in the Gold Coast: “the parents ‘tie their children to boards and throw them into the water.’” In 1679 CE, Barbot provided an account of surfing among Elmina children in Ghana: “children at Elmina learned “to swim, on bits of boards, or small bundles of rushes, fasten’d under their stomachs, which is a good diversion to the spectators.” James Alexander provided an account of surfing in Accra, Ghana in 1834 CE: “From the beach, meanwhile, might be seen boys swimming into the sea, with light boards under their stomachs. They waited for a surf; and came rolling like a cloud on top of it. But I was told that sharks occasionally dart in behind the rocks and ‘yam’ them.” Thomas Hutchinson provided an account of surfing in southern Cameroon in 1861: “Fishermen rode small dugouts ‘no more than six feet in length, fourteen to sixteen inches in width, and from four to six inches in depth.’”

===California===

In July 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Matthew&#x27;s Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California. There, David Kawānanakoa, Edward Keliʻiahonui and Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole surfed the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on custom-shaped redwood boards, according to surf historians Kim Stoner and Geoff Dunn. In 1890, the pioneer in agricultural education John Wrightson reputedly became the first British surfer when instructed by two Hawaiian students at his college.

George Freeth (1883–1919), of English and Native Hawaiian descent, is generally credited as the person who had done more than anyone else to renew interest in surfing at Waikiki in the early twentieth century after the sport had declined in popularity in Hawaii during the latter half of the nineteenth century.

In 1907, the eclectic interests of land developer Abbot Kinney (founder of Venice of America, now Venice, California) helped bring Freeth to California. Freeth had sought the help of the Hawaii Promotion Committee (HPC) in Honolulu to sponsor him on a trip to California to give surfing exhibitions. The HPC arranged through their contacts in Los Angeles to secure a contract for Freeth to perform at Venice of America in July, 1907. Later that year, land baron Henry E. Huntington brought surfing to Redondo Beach. Looking for a way to entice visitors to his own budding resort community south of Venice where he had heavily invested in real estate, he hired Freeth as a lifeguard and to give surfing exhibitions in front of the Hotel Redondo. Another native Hawaiian, Duke Kahanamoku, spread surfing to both the U.S. and Australia, riding the waves after displaying the swimming prowess that won him Olympic gold medals in 1912 and 1920.

Mary Ann Hawkins, inspired by Duke Kahanamoku&#x27;s surfing during the late 1920s, developed a lifelong passion for surfing. In 1935, her family relocated to Santa Monica, providing her with opportunities to further immerse herself in surfing and paddleboarding. On September 12, 1936, Hawkins achieved a historic milestone by winning California’s first women’s paddleboard race at the Santa Monica Breakwater. She continued to dominate the sport, winning numerous competitions, including the women’s half-mile paddleboard race and the Venice Breakwater event in 1938, both held on the same day. 
Hawkins was also a pioneer in tandem surfing, a discipline that highlights synchronized surfing between two individuals on a single board. She gained further recognition in 1939 when she performed exhibition paddleboarding and tandem surfing displays at various Southern California beaches, inspiring a new generation of women surfers. 
In January 1939, Hawkins was appointed head of the women’s auxiliary group of the Santa Monica Paddle Club and rose to vice president by January 1940. Her surfing peers frequently lauded her achievements, with &quot;Whitey&quot; Harrison describing her as &quot;the best tandem rider.&quot; Throughout her career, Hawkins exemplified grace and athleticism, leaving an indelible mark on the history of women’s surfing and paddleboarding.
In 1975, a professional tour started. That year Margo Oberg became the first female professional surfer.
==Surf waves==

Swell is generated when the wind blows consistently over a large space of open water, called the wind&#x27;s fetch. The size of a swell is determined by the strength of the wind, and the length of its fetch and duration. Because of these factors, the surf tends to be larger and more prevalent on coastlines exposed to large expanses of ocean traversed by intense low pressure systems.

Local wind conditions affect wave quality since the surface of a wave can become choppy in blustery conditions. Ideal conditions include a light to moderate &quot;offshore&quot; wind, because it blows into the front of the wave, making it a &quot;barrel&quot; or &quot;tube&quot; wave. Waves are left-handed and right-handed depending upon the breaking formation of the wave.

Waves are generally recognized by the surfaces over which they break. For example, there are beach breaks, reef breaks and point breaks.

The most important influence on wave shape is the topography of the seabed directly behind and immediately beneath the breaking wave. Each break is different since each location&#x27;s underwater topography is unique. At beach breaks, sandbanks change shape from week to week. Surf forecasting is aided by advances in information technology. Mathematical modeling graphically depicts the size and direction of swells around the globe.

Swell regularity varies across the globe and throughout the year. During winter, heavy swells are generated in the mid-latitudes, when the North and South polar fronts shift toward the Equator. The predominantly Westerly winds generate swells that advance Eastward, so waves tend to be largest on West coasts during winter months. However, an endless train of mid-latitude cyclones cause the isobars to become undulated, redirecting swells at regular intervals toward the tropics.

East coasts also receive heavy winter swells when low-pressure cells form in the sub-tropics, where slow moving highs inhibit their movement. These lows produce a shorter fetch than polar fronts, however, they can still generate heavy swells since their slower movement increases the duration of a particular wind direction. The variables of fetch and duration both influence how long wind acts over a wave as it travels since a wave reaching the end of a fetch behaves as if the wind died.

During summer, heavy swells are generated when cyclones form in the tropics. Tropical cyclones form over warm seas, so their occurrence is influenced by El Niño and La Niña cycles. Their movements are unpredictable.

Surf travel and some surf camps offer surfers access to remote, tropical locations, where tradewinds ensure offshore conditions. Since winter swells are generated by mid-latitude cyclones, their regularity coincides with the passage of these lows. Swells arrive in pulses, each lasting for a couple of days, with a few days between each swell.

The availability of free model data from the NOAA has allowed the creation of several surf forecasting websites.

===Tube shape and speed===
Tube shape is defined by length to width ratio. A perfectly cylindrical vortex has a ratio of 1:1. Other forms include:
* Square: &lt;1:1
* Round: 1–2:1
* Almond: &gt;2:1

&quot;Peel&quot; or &quot;peeling off&quot; as a descriptive term for the quality of a break has been defined as &quot;a fast, clean, evenly falling curl line, perfect for surfing, and usually found at pointbreaks.&quot;

Tube speed is the rate of advance of the break along the length of the wave, and is the speed at which the surfer must move along the wave to keep up with the advance of the tube. 
Tube speed can be described using the peel angle and wave celerity. Peel angle is the angle between the wave front and the horizontal projection of the point of break over time, which in a regular break is most easily represented by the line of white water left after the break. A break that closes out, or breaks all at once along its length, leaves white water parallel to the wave front, and has a peel angle of 0°. This is unsurfable as it would require infinite speed to progress along the face fast enough to keep up with the break. A break which advances along the wave face more slowly will leave a line of new white water at an angle to the line of the wave face.

Where:
:formula_2velocity of surfer along the wave face
:formula_3wave celerity (velocity in direction of propagation)
:formula_4peel angle

In most cases a peel angle less than 25° is too fast to surf.

* Fast: 30°
* Medium: 45°
* Slow: 60°

===Wave intensity===
The type of break depends on shoaling rate. Breaking waves can be classified as four basic types: spilling (ξb&lt;0.4), plunging (0.4&lt;ξb&lt;2), collapsing (ξb&gt;2) and surging (ξb&gt;2), and which type occurs depends on the slope of the bottom.

Waves suitable for surfing break as spilling or plunging types, and when they also have a suitable peel angle, their value for surfing is enhanced. Other factors such as wave height and period, and wind strength and direction can also influence steepness and intensity of the break, but the major influence on the type and shape of breaking waves is determined by the slope of the seabed before the break. The breaker type index and Iribarren number allow classification of breaker type as a function of wave steepness and seabed slope.

===Artificial reefs===
The value of good surf in attracting surf tourism has prompted the construction of artificial reefs and sand bars. Artificial surfing reefs can be built with durable sandbags or concrete, and resemble a submerged breakwater. These artificial reefs not only provide a surfing location, but also dissipate wave energy and shelter the coastline from erosion. Ships such as Seli 1 that have accidentally stranded on sandy bottoms, can create sandbanks that give rise to good waves.

An artificial reef known as Chevron Reef was constructed in El Segundo, California in hopes of creating a new surfing area. However, the reef failed to produce any quality waves and was removed in 2008. In Kovalam, South West India, an artificial reef has successfully provided the local community with a quality lefthander, stabilized coastal soil erosion, and provided good habitat for marine life. ASR Ltd., a New Zealand-based company, constructed the Kovalam reef and is working on another reef in Boscombe, England.

===Artificial waves===
Even with artificial reefs in place, a tourist&#x27;s vacation time may coincide with a &quot;flat spell&quot;, when no waves are available. Completely artificial wave pools aim to solve that problem by controlling all the elements that go into creating perfect surf, however there are only a handful of wave pools that can simulate good surfing waves, owing primarily to construction and operation costs and potential liability. Most wave pools generate waves that are too small and lack the power necessary to surf. The Seagaia Ocean Dome, located in Miyazaki, Japan, was an example of a surfable wave pool. Able to generate waves with up to faces, the specialized pump held water in 20 vertical tanks positioned along the back edge of the pool. This allowed the waves to be directed as they approach the artificial sea floor. Lefts, Rights, and A-frames could be directed from this pump design providing for rippable surf and barrel rides. The Ocean Dome cost about $2 billion to build and was expensive to maintain. The Ocean Dome was closed in 2007. In England, construction is nearing completion on the Wave, situated near Bristol, which will enable people unable to get to the coast to enjoy the waves in a controlled environment, set in the heart of nature.

There are two main types of artificial waves that exist today. One being artificial or stationary waves which simulate a moving, breaking wave by pumping a layer of water against a smooth structure mimicking the shape of a breaking wave. Because of the velocity of the rushing water, the wave and the surfer can remain stationary while the water rushes by under the surfboard. Artificial waves of this kind provide the opportunity to try surfing and learn its basics in a moderately small and controlled environment near or far from locations with natural surf.

==Maneuvers==


Standup surfing begins when the surfer paddles toward shore in an attempt to match the speed of the wave (the same applies whether the surfer is standup paddling, bodysurfing, boogie-boarding or using some other type of watercraft, such as a waveski or kayak). Once the wave begins to carry the surfer forward, the surfer stands up and proceeds to ride the wave. The basic idea is to position the surfboard so it is just ahead of the breaking part (whitewash) of the wave, in the so-called &#x27;pocket&#x27;. It is difficult for beginners to catch the wave at all.

Surfers&#x27; skills are tested by their ability to control their board in difficult conditions, riding challenging waves, and executing maneuvers such as strong turns and cutbacks (turning board back to the breaking wave) and &quot;carving&quot; (a series of strong back-to-back maneuvers). More advanced skills include the &quot;floater&quot; (riding on top of the breaking curl of the wave), and &quot;off the lip&quot; (banking off crest of the breaking wave). A newer addition to surfing is the progression of the &quot;air,&quot; whereby a surfer propels off the wave entirely up into the air and then successfully lands the board back on the wave.

The tube ride is considered to be the ultimate maneuver in surfing. As a wave breaks, if the conditions are ideal, the wave will break in an orderly line from the middle to the shoulder, enabling the experienced surfer to position themselves inside the wave as it is breaking. This is known as a tube ride. Viewed from the shore, the tube rider may disappear from view as the wave breaks over the rider&#x27;s head. The longer the surfer remains in the tube, the more successful the ride. This is referred to as getting tubed, barrelled, shacked or pitted. Some of the world&#x27;s best-known waves for tube riding include Pipeline on the North Shore of Oahu, Teahupoo in Tahiti and G-Land in Java. Other names for the tube include &quot;the barrel&quot;, and &quot;the pit&quot;.

Hanging ten and hanging five are moves usually specific to longboarding. Hanging Ten refers to having both feet on the front end of the board with all of the surfer&#x27;s toes off the edge, also known as nose-riding. Hanging Five is having just one foot near the front, with five toes off the edge.

Cutback: Generating speed down the line and then turning back to reverse direction.

Snap: Quickly turning along the face or top of the wave, almost as if snapping the board back towards the wave. Typically done on steeper waves.

Blowtail: Pushing the tail of the board out of the back of the wave so that the fins leave the water.

Floater: Suspending the board atop the wave. Very popular on small waves.

Top-Turn: Turn off the top of the wave. Sometimes used to generate speed and sometimes to shoot spray.

Bottom Turn: A turn at the bottom or mid-face of the wave, this maneuver is used to set up other maneuvers such as the top turn, cutback and even aerials.

Airs/Aerials: These maneuvers have been becoming more and more prevalent in the sport in both competition and free surfing. An air is when the surfer can achieve enough speed and approach a certain type of section of a wave that is supposed to act as a ramp and launch the surfer above the lip line of the wave, “catching air”, and landing either in the transition of the wave or the whitewash when hitting a close-out section.

Airs can either be straight airs or rotational airs. Straight airs have minimal rotation if any, but definitely no more rotation than 90 degrees. Rotational airs require a rotation of 90 degrees or more depending on the level of the surfer.

Types of rotations:

* 180 degrees – called an air reverse, this is when the surfer spins enough to land backwards, then reverts to their original positional with the help of the fins. This rotation can either be done frontside or backside and can spin right or left.
* 360 degrees – this is a full rotation air or “full rotor” where the surfer lands where they started or more, as long as they do not land backwards. When this is achieved front side on a wave spinning the opposite of an air reverse is called an alley-oop.
* 540 degrees – the surfer does a full rotation plus another 180 degrees and can be inverted or spinning straight, few surfers have been able to land this air.
* Backflip – usually done with a double grab, this hard to land air is made for elite-level surfers.
* Rodeo flip – usually done backside, it is a backflip with a 180 rotation, and is actually easier than a straight backflip.
* Grabs – a surfer can help land an aerial maneuver by grabbing the surfboard, keeping them attached to the board and keeping the board under their feet. Common types of grabs include:
** Indy – a grab on the surfers inside rail going frontside, outside rail going backside with their backhand.
** Slob – a grab on the surfers inside rail going frontside, outside rail going backside with their front hand.
** Lien – A grab on the surfers outside rail frontside, inside rail going backside with their front hand.
** Stalefish – A grab on the surfers outside rail frontside, inside rail backside with their backhand.
** Double grab – A grab on the surfers inside and outside rail, the inside rail with the backhand and the outside rail with the front hand.

===Terms===
The Glossary of surfing includes some of the extensive vocabulary used to describe various aspects of the sport of surfing as described in literature on the subject. In some cases terms have spread to a wider cultural use. These terms were originally coined by people who were directly involved in the sport of surfing.

==Learning==
Many popular surfing destinations have surf schools and surf camps that offer lessons. Surf camps for beginners and intermediates are multi-day lessons that focus on surfing fundamentals. They are designed to take new surfers and help them become proficient riders. All-inclusive surf camps offer overnight accommodations, meals, lessons and surfboards. Most surf lessons begin with instruction and a safety briefing on land, followed by instructors helping students into waves on longboards or &quot;softboards&quot;. The softboard is considered the ideal surfboard for learning, due to the fact it is safer, and has more paddling speed and stability than shorter boards. Funboards are also a popular shape for beginners as they combine the volume and stability of the longboard with the manageable size of a smaller surfboard. New and inexperienced surfers typically learn to catch waves on softboards around the funboard size. Due to the softness of the surfboard the chance of getting injured is substantially minimized.

It is possible to learn to surf without an instructor, but the process is usually safer and quicker with a surf instructor. Typical surfing instruction is best-performed one-on-one, but can also be done in a group setting. Post-COVID, there&#x27;s been a shift towards online and land-based surf coaching and training. Online surf coaching is allowing surfers to learn at their own pace and convenience from anywhere. Land-based training, such as skateboard simulations, offers a way to practice maneuvers repeatedly, refining techniques with the guidance of professional coaches either in person or remotely using video analysis apps. The most popular surf locations offer perfect surfing conditions for beginners, as well as challenging breaks for advanced students. The ideal conditions for learning would be small waves that crumble and break softly, as opposed to the steep, fast-peeling waves desired by more experienced surfers. When available, a sandy seabed is generally safer.

Surfing can be broken into several skills: paddling strength, positioning to catch the wave, timing, and balance. Paddling out requires strength, but also the mastery of techniques to break through oncoming waves (&quot;duck diving&quot;, &quot;eskimo roll&quot; also known as &quot;turtle roll&quot;). Take-off positioning requires experience at predicting the wave set and where it will break. The surfer must pop up quickly as soon as the wave starts pushing the board forward. Preferred positioning on the wave is determined by experience at reading wave features including where the wave is breaking. Balance plays a crucial role in standing on a surfboard. Thus, balance training exercises are good preparation. Practicing with a balance board, longboard (skateboard), surfskate or swing board helps novices master the art of surfing. However, it&#x27;s important to note that these land-based training methods have faced criticism within the surf coaching community. Concerns include the potential for developing poor surfing style and habits, such as excessive wiggling, due to training on flat surfaces which do not accurately mimic the dynamic nature of ocean waves.

To address these limitations, training in a skate bowl is recommended. Skate bowls can offer a more realistic simulation of the centrifugal forces experienced while surfing. This type of training helps in developing better control and style by replicating the curved, wave-like shapes and motions surfers encounter in the water. Integrating skate bowl training can provide a more comprehensive preparation for the surfing experience, balancing the benefits of basic balance training with the nuances of wave dynamics.

The repetitive cycle of paddling, popping up, and balancing requires stamina and physical strength. Having a proper warm-up routine can help prevent injuries.

==Equipment==

Surfing can be done on various equipment, including surfboards, longboards, stand up paddle boards (SUPs), bodyboards, wave skis, skimboards, kneeboards, surf mats and macca&#x27;s trays. Surfboards were originally made of solid wood and were large and heavy (often up to long and having a mass of ). Lighter balsa wood surfboards (first made in the late 1940s and early 1950s) were a significant improvement, not only in portability, but also in increasing maneuverability.

Most modern surfboards are made of fiberglass foam (PU), with one or more wooden strips or &quot;stringers&quot;, fiberglass cloth, and polyester resin (PE). An emerging board material is epoxy resin and Expanded Polystyrene foam (EPS) which is stronger and lighter than traditional PU/PE construction. Even newer designs incorporate materials such as carbon fiber and variable-flex composites in conjunction with fiberglass and epoxy or polyester resins. Since epoxy/EPS surfboards are generally lighter, they will float better than a traditional PU/PE board of similar size, shape and thickness. This makes them easier to paddle and faster in the water. However, a common complaint of EPS boards is that they do not provide as much feedback as a traditional PU/PE board. For this reason, many advanced surfers prefer that their surfboards be made from traditional materials.

Other equipment includes a leash (to stop the board from drifting away after a wipeout and to prevent it from hitting other surfers), surf wax, traction pads (to keep a surfer&#x27;s feet from slipping off the deck of the board), and fins (also known as &quot;skegs&quot;) which can either be permanently attached (&quot;glassed-on&quot;) or interchangeable. Sportswear designed or particularly suitable for surfing may be sold as &quot;boardwear&quot; (the term is also used in snowboarding). In warmer climates, swimsuits, surf trunks or boardshorts are worn, and occasionally rash guards; in cold water, surfers can opt to wear wetsuits, boots, hoods, and gloves to protect them against lower water temperatures. A newer introduction is a rash vest with a thin layer of titanium to provide maximum warmth without compromising mobility. In recent years, there have been advancements in technology that have allowed surfers to pursue even bigger waves with added elements of safety. Big wave surfers are now experimenting with inflatable vests or colored dye packs to help decrease their odds of drowning.

There are many different surfboard sizes, shapes, and designs in use today. Modern longboards, generally in length, are reminiscent of the earliest surfboards, but now benefit from modern innovations in surfboard shaping and fin design. Competitive longboard surfers need to be competent at traditional &quot;walking&quot; manoeuvres, as well as the short-radius turns normally associated with shortboard surfing. The modern shortboard began life in the late 1960s and has evolved into today&#x27;s common &quot;thruster&quot; style, defined by its three fins, usually around in length. The thruster was invented by Australian shaper Simon Anderson.

Midsize boards, often called funboards, provide more maneuverability than a longboard, with more flotation than a shortboard. While many surfers find that funboards live up to their name, providing the best of both surfing modes, others are critical.

:&quot;It is the happy medium of mediocrity,&quot; writes Steven Kotler. &quot;Funboard riders either have nothing left to prove or lack the skills to prove anything.&quot;

There are also various niche styles, such as the &quot;Egg&quot;, a longboard-style short board targeted at people who want to ride a shortboard but need more paddle power. The &quot;Fish&quot;, a board that is typically shorter, flatter, and wider than a normal shortboard, often with a split tail (known as a &quot;swallow tail&quot;). The Fish often has two or four fins and is specifically designed for surfing smaller waves. For big waves, there is the &quot;Gun&quot;, a long, thick board with a pointed nose and tail (known as a pintail) specifically designed for big waves.

== The physics of surfing ==
The physics of surfing involves the physical oceanographic properties of wave creation in the surf zone, the characteristics of the surfboard, and the surfer&#x27;s interaction with the water and the board.

=== Wave formation ===
Ocean waves are defined as a collection of dislocated water parcels that undergo a cycle of being forced past their normal position and being restored back to their normal position. Wind causes ripples and eddies to form waves that gradually gain speed and distance (fetch). Waves increase in energy and speed and then become longer and stronger. The fully-developed sea has the strongest wave action that experiences storms lasting 10-hours and creates wave heights in the open ocean.

The waves created in the open ocean are classified as deep-water waves. Deep-water waves have no bottom interaction and the orbits of these water molecules are circular; their wavelength is short relative to water depth and the velocity decays before reaching the bottom of the water basin. Deep water waves are waves in water depths greater than half their wavelengths. Wind forces waves to break in the deep sea.

Deep-water waves travel to shore and become shallow-water waves when the water depth is less than half of their wavelength, and the wave motion becomes constrained by the bottom, causing the orbit paths to be flattened to ellipses. The bottom exerts a frictional drag on the bottom of the wave, which decreases the celerity (or the speed of the waveform), and causes refraction. Slowing the wave forces it to shorten which increases the height and steepness, and the top (crest) falls because the velocity of the top of the wave becomes greater than the velocity of the bottom of the wave where the drag occurs.

The surf zone is the place of convergence of multiple waves types creating complex wave patterns. A wave suitable for surfing results from maximum speeds of . This speed is relative because local onshore winds can cause waves to break. In the surf zone, shallow water waves are carried by global winds to the beach and interact with local winds to make surfing waves.

Different onshore and off-shore wind patterns in the surf zone create different types of waves. Onshore winds cause random wave breaking patterns and are more suitable for experienced surfers. Light offshore winds create smoother waves, while strong direct offshore winds cause plunging or large barrel waves. Barrel waves are large because the water depth is small when the wave breaks. Thus, the breaker intensity (or force) increases, and the wave speed and height increase. Off-shore winds produce non-surfable conditions by flattening a weak swell. Weak swell is made from surface gravity forces and has long wavelengths.

=== Wave conditions for surfing ===
Surfing waves can be analyzed using the following parameters: breaking wave height, wave peel angle (α), wave breaking intensity, and wave section length. The breaking wave height has two measurements, the relative heights estimated by surfers and the exact measurements done by physical oceanographers. Measurements done by surfers were 1.36 to 2.58 times higher than the measurements done by scientists. The scientifically concluded wave heights that are physically possible to surf are .

The wave peel angle is one of the main constituents of a potential surfing wave. Wave peel angle measures the distance between the peel-line and the line tangent to the breaking crest line. This angle controls the speed of the wave crest. The speed of the wave is an addition of the propagation velocity vector (Vw) and peel velocity vector (Vp), which results in the overall velocity of the wave (Vs).

Wave breaking intensity measures the force of the wave as it breaks, spills, or plunges (a plunging wave is termed by surfers as a &quot;barrel wave&quot;). Wave section length is the distance between two breaking crests in a wave set. Wave section length can be hard to measure because local winds, non-linear wave interactions, island sheltering, and swell interactions can cause multifarious wave configurations in the surf zone.

The parameters breaking wave height, wave peel angle (α), and wave breaking intensity, and wave section length are important because they are standardized by past oceanographers who researched surfing; these parameters have been used to create a guide that matches the type of wave formed and the skill level of surfer.

Table 1 shows a relationship of smaller peel angles correlating with a higher skill level of the surfer. Smaller wave peel angles increase the velocities of waves. A surfer must know how to react and paddle quickly to match the speed of the wave to catch it. Therefore, more experience is required to catch low peel angle waves. More experienced surfers can handle longer section lengths, increased velocities, and higher wave heights. Different locations offer different types of surfing conditions for each skill level.

=== Surf breaks ===
A surf break is an area with an obstruction or an object that causes a wave to break. Surf breaks entail multiple scale phenomena. Wave section creation has microscale factors of peel angle and wave breaking intensity. The micro-scale components influence wave height and variations on wave crests. The mesoscale components of surf breaks are the ramp, platform, wedge, or ledge that may be present at a surf break. Macro-scale processes are the global winds that initially produce offshore waves. Types of surf breaks are headlands (point break), beach break, river/estuary entrance bar, reef breaks, and ledge breaks.

==== Headland (point break) ====
A headland or point break interacts with the water by causing refraction around the point or headland. The point absorbs the high-frequency waves and long-period waves persist, which are easier to surf. Examples of locations that have headland or point break-induced surf breaks are Dunedin (New Zealand), Raglan (New Zealand), Malibu (California), Rincon (California), and Kirra (Australia).

==== Beach break ====
A beach break is an area of open coastline where the waves break over a sand-bottom. They are the most common, yet also the most volatile of surf breaks. Wave breaks happen successively at beach breaks, as in there are multiple peaks to surf at a single beach break location. Example locations are Tairua and Aramoana Beach (New Zealand) and the Gold Coast (Australia).
==== River or estuary entrance bar ====
A river or estuary entrance bar creates waves from the ebb-tidal delta, sediment outflow, and tidal currents. An ideal estuary entrance bar exists in Whangamata Bar, New Zealand.

==== Reef break ====
A reef break is conducive to surfing because large waves consistently break over the reef. The reef is usually made of coral, and because of this, many injuries occur while surfing reef breaks. However, the waves that are produced by reef breaks are some of the best in the world. Famous reef breaks are present in Padang Padang (Indonesia), Pipeline (Hawaii), Uluwatu (Bali), and Teahupo&#x27;o (Tahiti).

==== Ledge break ====
A ledge break is formed by steep rocks ledges that make intense waves because the waves travel through deeper water then abruptly reach shallower water at the ledge. Shark Island, Australia is a location with a ledge break. Ledge breaks create difficult surfing conditions, sometimes only allowing body surfing as the only feasible way to confront the waves.

=== Jetties and their impacts on wave formation in the surf zone ===
Jetties are added to bodies of water to regulate erosion, preserve navigation channels, and make harbors. Jetties are classified into four different types and have two main controlling variables: the type of delta and the size of the jetty.

==== Type 1 jetty ====
The first classification is a type 1 jetty. This type of jetty is significantly longer than the surf zone width and the waves break at the shore end of the jetty. The effect of a Type 1 jetty is sediment accumulation in a wedge formation on the jetty. These waves are large and increase in size as they pass over the sediment wedge formation. An example of a Type 1 jetty is Mission Beach, San Diego, California. This 1000-meter jetty was installed in 1950 at the mouth of Mission Bay. The surf waves happen north of the jetty, are longer waves, and are powerful. The bathymetry of the sea bottom in Mission Bay has a wedge shape formation that causes the waves to refract as they become closer to the jetty. The waves converge constructively after they refract and increase the sizes of the waves.

==== Type 2 jetty ====
A type 2 jetty occurs in an ebb-tidal delta, a delta transitioning between high and low tide. This area has shallow water, refraction, and distinctive seabed shapes that create large wave heights.

An example of a type 2 jetty is called &quot;The Poles&quot; in Atlantic Beach, Florida. Atlantic Beach is known to have flat waves, with exceptions during major storms. However, &quot;The Poles&quot; has larger than normal waves due to a 500-meter jetty that was installed on the south side of St. Johns. This jetty was built to make a deep channel in the river. It formed a delta at &quot;The Poles&quot;. This is a special area because the jetty increases wave size for surfing when comparing pre-conditions and post-conditions of the southern St. Johns River mouth area.

The wave size at &quot;The Poles&quot; depends on the direction of the incoming water. When easterly waters (from 55°) interact with the jetty, they create waves larger than southern waters (from 100°). When southern waves (from 100°) move toward &quot;The Poles&quot;, one of the waves breaks north of the southern jetty and the other breaks south of the jetty. This does not allow for merging to make larger waves. Easterly waves, from 55°, converge north of the jetty and unite to make bigger waves.

==== Type 3 jetty ====
A type 3 jetty is in an ebb-tidal area with an unchanging seabed that has naturally created waves. Examples of a Type 3 jetty occurs in “Southside” Tamarack, Carlsbad, California.

==== Type 4 jetty ====
A type 4 jetty is one that no longer functions nor traps sediment. The waves are created from reefs in the surf zone. A type 4 jetty can be found in Tamarack, Carlsbad, California.

=== Rip currents ===
Rip currents are fast, narrow currents that are caused by onshore transport within the surf zone and the successive return of the water seaward. The wedge bathymetry makes a convenient and consistent rip current of 5–10 meters that brings the surfers to the “take-off point” then out to the beach.

Oceanographers have two theories on rip current formation. The wave interaction model assumes that two edges of waves interact, create differing wave heights, and cause longshore transport of nearshore currents. The Boundary Interaction Model assumes that the topography of the sea bottom causes nearshore circulation and longshore transport; the result of both models is a rip current.

Rip currents can be extremely strong and narrow as they extend out of the surf zone into deeper water, reaching speeds from and up to , which is faster than any human can swim. The water in the jet is sediment rich, bubble rich, and moves rapidly. The rip head of the rip current has long shore movement. Rip currents are common on beaches with mild slopes that experience sizeable and frequent oceanic swell.

=== On the surfboard ===
A longer surfboard of causes more friction with the water; therefore, it will be slower than a smaller and lighter board with a length of . Longer boards are good for beginners who need help balancing. Smaller boards are good for more experienced surfers who want to have more control and maneuverability.

When practicing the sport of surfing, the surfer paddles out past the wave break to wait for a wave. When a surfable wave arrives, the surfer must paddle extremely fast to match the velocity of the wave so the wave can accelerate him or her.

When the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, and stay toward the front of the wave to become stable and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The acceleration is less toward the front than toward the back. The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (F·sinθ) and the vertical force (F·cosθ=mg). Therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain speed, and lean on the back foot to brake. Also, to increase the length of the ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the wave crest.

==Dangers==

===Drowning===
Surfing, like all water sports, carries the inherent risk of drowning. Although the board assists a surfer in staying buoyant, it can become separated from the user. A leash, attached to the ankle or knee, can keep a board from being swept away, but does not keep a rider on the board or above water. In some cases, possibly including the drowning of professional surfer Mark Foo, the leash can be a cause of drowning by snagging on a reef or other object and holding the surfer underwater. By keeping the surfboard close to the surfer during a wipeout, a leash also increases the chances that the board may strike the rider, which could knock them unconscious and lead to drowning (especially with a hard surfboard instead of a soft surfboard). A fallen rider&#x27;s board can become trapped in larger waves, and if the rider is attached by a leash, they can be dragged for long distances underwater. Surfers should be careful to remain in smaller surf until they have acquired the advanced skills and experience necessary to handle bigger waves and more challenging conditions. Even world-class surfers have drowned in extremely challenging conditions.

===Collisions===

Under the wrong set of conditions, anything that a surfer&#x27;s body can come in contact with is a potential hazard, including sand bars, rocks, small ice, reefs, surfboards, and other surfers. Collisions with these objects can sometimes cause injuries such as cuts and scrapes and in rare instances, death.

A large number of injuries, up to 66%, are caused by collision with a surfboard (nose or fins). Fins can cause deep lacerations and cuts, as well as bruising. While these injuries can be minor, they can open the skin to infection from the sea; groups like Surfers Against Sewage campaign for cleaner waters to reduce the risk of infections. Local bugs and diseases can be risk factors when surfing around the globe.

Falling off a surfboard or colliding with others is commonly referred to as a &quot;wipeout&quot;.
===Marine life===
Sea life can sometimes cause injuries (Bethany Hamilton) and even fatalities. Animals such as sharks, stingrays, Weever fish, seals and jellyfish can sometimes present a danger. Warmer-water surfers often do the &quot;stingray shuffle&quot; as they walk out through the shallows, shuffling their feet in the sand to scare away stingrays that may be resting on the bottom.

===Rip currents===

Rip currents are water channels that flow away from the shore. Under the wrong circumstances these currents can endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. Since a rip current appears to be an area of flat water, tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers may enter one and be carried out beyond the breaking waves. Although many rip currents are much smaller, the largest rip currents have a width of . The flow of water moving out towards the sea in a rip will be stronger than most swimmers, making swimming back to shore difficult, however, by paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can easily exit a rip current. Alternatively, some surfers actually ride on a rip current because it is a fast and effortless way to get out beyond the zone of breaking waves.

===Seabed===
The seabed can pose a risk for surfers. If a surfer falls while riding a wave, the wave tosses and tumbles the surfer around, often in a downwards direction. At reef breaks and beach breaks, surfers have been seriously injured and even killed, because of a violent collision with the sea bed, the water above which can sometimes be very shallow, especially at beach breaks or reef breaks during low tide. Cyclops, Western Australia, for example, is one of the biggest and thickest reef breaks in the world, with waves measuring up to high, but the reef below is only about below the surface of the water.

===Microorganisms===
A January 2018 study by the University of Exeter called the &quot;Beach Bum Survey&quot; found surfers and bodyboarders to be three times as likely as non-surfers to harbor antibiotic-resistant &quot;E. coli&quot; and four times as likely to harbor other bacteria capable of easily becoming antibiotic resistant. The researchers attributed this to the fact that surfers swallow roughly ten times as much seawater as swimmers.

===Ear damage===

Surfers sometimes use ear protection such as ear plugs to avoid surfer&#x27;s ear, inflammation of the ear or other damage. Surfer&#x27;s ear is where the bone near the ear canal grows after repeated exposure to cold water, making the ear canal narrower. The narrowed canal makes it harder for water to drain from the ear. This can result in pain, infection and sometimes ringing of the ear.

Ear plugs designed for surfers, swimmers and other water athletes are primarily made to keep water out of the ear, thereby letting a protective pocket of air stay inside the ear canal. They can also block cold air, dirt and bacteria. Many designs are made to let sound through, and either float and/or have a leash in case the plug accidentally gets bumped out.

=== Surf rash ===
Surf rash appears in many different ways on the skin, commonly as a painful red bumpy patch located on the surfer&#x27;s chest or inner legs. A rash guard will lessen the incidence of surf rash caused by abrasion or sunburn. Healing ointments such as petroleum jelly can be used to treat irritated skin.

=== Spinal cord ===
Surfer&#x27;s myelopathy is a rare spinal cord injury causing paralysis of the lower extremities, caused by hyperextension of the back. This is due to one of the main blood vessels of the spine becoming kinked, depriving the spinal cord of oxygen. In some cases the paralysis is permanent. Although any activity where the back is arched can cause this condition (i.e. yoga, pilates, etc.), this rare phenomenon has most often been seen in those surfing for the first time. According to DPT Sergio Florian, some recommendations for preventing myelopathy is proper warm up, limiting the session length and sitting on the board while waiting for waves, rather than lying.

==Surfers and surf culture==

Surfers represent a diverse culture based on riding the waves. Some people practice surfing as a recreational activity, while others make it the central focus of their lives. Surfing culture in the US is most dominant in Hawaii and California, because these two states offer the best surfing conditions. However, waves can be found wherever there is coastline, and a tight-knit yet far-reaching subculture of surfers has emerged throughout America. Some historical markers of the culture included the woodie, the station wagon used to carry surfers&#x27; boards, as well as boardshorts, the long swim shorts typically worn while surfing. Surfers also wear wetsuits in colder regions and when the seasons cool the air and water.

During the 1960s, as surfing caught on in California, its popularity spread through American pop culture. Several teen movies, starting with the Gidget series in 1959, transformed surfing into a dream life for American youth. Later movies, including Beach Party (1963), Ride the Wild Surf (1964), and Beach Blanket Bingo (1965) promoted the California dream of sun and surf. Surf culture also fueled the early records of the Beach Boys.

The sport is also a significant part of Australia&#x27;s eastern coast sub-cultural life, especially in New South Wales, where the weather and water conditions are most favourable for surfing.

The sport of surfing now represents a multibillion-dollar industry, especially in clothing and fashion markets. Founded in 1964, the International Surfing Association (ISA) is the oldest foundation associated with surfing formed to better improve surfing and recognized by the International Olympic Committee as the leading authority on surfing. National and international surf competitions began in 1964. In addition, The World Surf League (WSL) was established in 1976 and promotes various championship tours, hosting top competitors in some of the best surf spots around the globe. A small number of people make a career out of surfing by receiving corporate sponsorships and performing for photographers and videographers in far-flung destinations; they are typically referred to as freesurfers. Sixty-six surfers on a long surfboard set a record in Huntington Beach, California for most people on a surfboard at one time. Dale Webster consecutively surfed for 14,641 days, making it his main life focus.

As of 2023, the Guinness Book of World Records recognized a 26.2 m (86 ft) wave ride by Sebastian Steudtner at Nazaré, Portugal as the largest wave ever surfed.

When the waves were flat, surfers persevered with sidewalk surfing, which is now called skateboarding. Sidewalk surfing has a similar feel to surfing and requires only a paved road or sidewalk. To create the feel of the wave, surfers even sneaked into empty backyard swimming pools to ride in, known as pool skating. Eventually, surfing made its way to the slopes with the invention of the Snurfer, later credited as the first snowboard. Many other board sports have been invented over the years, but all can trace their heritage back to surfing.

Many surfers claim to have a spiritual connection with the ocean, describing surfing, the surfing experience, both in and out of the water, as a type of spiritual experience or a religion.
