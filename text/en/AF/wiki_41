<text>The Rhine ( ) is one of the major European rivers. The river begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps. It forms part of the Swiss-Liechtenstein border, then part of the Swiss-Austrian border. From Lake Constance downstream, it forms part of the Swiss-German border. After that the Rhine defines much of the Franco-German border. It then flows in a mostly northerly direction through the German Rhineland. Finally in Germany, the Rhine turns into a predominantly westerly direction and flows into the Netherlands where it eventually empties into the North Sea. It drains an area of 9,973 km2.

Its name derives from the Gaulish &quot;Rēnos&quot;. There are two German states named after the river, North Rhine-Westphalia and Rhineland-Palatinate, in addition to several districts (e.g. Rhein-Sieg). The departments of Bas-Rhin and Haut-Rhin in Alsace (France) are also named after the river. Some adjacent towns are named after it, such as Rheinau, Stein am Rhein, Rheineck, Rheinfelden (CH) and Rheinfelden (D).

The International Commission for the Hydrology of the Rhine Basin (CHR) and EUWID contend that the river could experience a massive decrease in volume, or even dry up completely in case of drought, within the next 30 to 80 years, as a result of the climate crisis.

The Rhine is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about , with an average discharge of about .

The Rhine and the Danube comprised much of the Roman Empire&#x27;s northern inland boundary, and the Rhine has been a vital navigable waterway bringing trade and goods deep inland since those days. The various castles and defenses built along it attest to its prominence as a waterway in the Holy Roman Empire. Among the largest and most important cities on the Rhine are Cologne, Rotterdam, Düsseldorf, Duisburg, Strasbourg, Arnhem, and Basel.

==Name==
The variants of the name of the Rhine (Latin Rhenus; French Rhin, Italian Reno, Romansh Rain or Rein, Dutch Rijn, Alemannic Ry, Ripuarian Rhing) in modern languages are all derived from the Gaulish name &#x27;, which was adapted in Roman-era geography (1st century BC) as Latin &#x27;, and as Greek (&quot;&quot;).

The spelling with &quot;Rh-&quot; in English &quot;Rhine&quot; as well as in German &#x27; and French &#x27; is due to the influence of Greek orthography, while the vocalization &quot;-i-&quot; is due to the Proto-Germanic adoption of the Gaulish name as *&quot;Rīnaz&quot;, via Old Frankish giving Old English &#x27;, Old High German &#x27;, early Middle Dutch () &#x27; (then also spelled &#x27; or &#x27;).

The modern German diphthong &#x27; (also used in Romansh) &#x27; is a Central German development of the early modern period, with the Alemannic name &#x27; keeping the older vocalism. In Alemannic, the deletion of the ending &quot;-n&quot; in pausa is a recent development; the form &#x27; is largely preserved in Lucernese dialects. &#x27; in Ripuarian is diphthongized, as is &#x27; in Palatine. While Spanish has adopted the Germanic vocalism &#x27;, Italian, Occitan, and Portuguese have retained the Latin &#x27;.

The Gaulish name &quot;Rēnos&quot; (Proto-Celtic or pre-Celtic &quot;*Reinos&quot;) belongs to a class of river names built from the PIE root &quot;&quot; &quot;to move, flow, run&quot;, also found in other names such as the Reno in Italy.

The grammatical gender of the Celtic name (as well as of its Greek and Latin adaptation) is masculine, and the name remains masculine in German, Dutch, French, Spanish and Italian. The Old English river name was variously inflected as masculine or feminine; and its Old Icelandic adoption was inflected as feminine.

==Geography==

The length of the Rhine is conventionally measured in &quot;Rhine-kilometers&quot; (&quot;Rheinkilometer&quot;), a scale introduced in 1939 that runs from the 0 km datum at Old Rhine Bridge in the city of Konstanz, at the western end of Lake Constance, to the Hook of Holland at 1,036.20 km.

The river is significantly shortened from its natural course due to a number of canal projects completed in the 19th and 20th centuries. The &quot;total length of the Rhine&quot;, to the inclusion of Lake Constance and the Alpine Rhine is more difficult to measure objectively; it was cited as by the Dutch Rijkswaterstaat in 2010.

Its course is conventionally divided as follows:


===Headwaters and sources===
====Sources====
The Rhine carries its name without distinctive accessories only from the confluence of the Rein Anteriur/Vorderrhein and Rein Posteriur/Hinterrhein next to Reichenau in Tamins. Above this point is the extensive catchment area of the headwaters of the Rhine. This area belongs almost exclusively to the Swiss canton of Grisons (), ranging from Saint-Gotthard Massif in the west via one valley lying in the canton of Ticino and Sondrio (Lombardy, Italy) in the south to the Flüela Pass in the east. The Rhine is one of four major rivers taking their source in the Gotthard region, along with the Ticino (drainage basin of the Po), Rhône and Reuss (Rhine basin). The Witenwasserenstock is the triple watershed between the Rhine, Rhône and Po.

Traditionally, Lake Toma near the Oberalp Pass in the Gotthard region is seen as the source of the Anterior Rhine and the Rhine as a whole. The Posterior Rhine rises in the Rheinwald below the Rheinwaldhorn.

====Anterior Rhine and Posterior Rhine====
The source of the river is generally considered north of &quot;Lai da Tuma/Tomasee&quot; on &quot;Rein Anteriur/Vorderrhein&quot;, although its southern tributary &quot;Rein da Medel&quot; is actually longer before its confluence with the Anterior Rhine near Disentis.

:The Anterior Rhine (, ) springs from &quot;Lai da Tuma/Tomasee&quot;, near the Oberalp Pass and passes the impressive &quot;Ruinaulta&quot; formed by the largest visible rock slide in the alps, the Flims Rockslide.

:The Posterior Rhine (, ) starts from the Paradies Glacier, near the &quot;Rheinwaldhorn&quot;. One of its tributaries, the &quot;Reno di Lei&quot;, drains the &quot;Valle di Lei&quot; on politically Italian territory. After three main valleys separated by the two gorges, &quot;Roflaschlucht&quot; and &quot;Viamala&quot;, it reaches Reichenau in Tamins.
The Anterior Rhine arises from numerous source streams in the upper Surselva and flows in an easterly direction. One source is &quot;Lai da Tuma&quot; () with the &quot;Rein da Tuma&quot;, which is usually indicated as source of the Rhine, flowing through it.

Into it flow tributaries from the south, some longer, some equal in length, such as the &quot;Rein da Medel&quot;, the &quot;Rein da Maighels&quot;, and the &quot;Rein da Curnera&quot;. The Cadlimo Valley in the canton of Ticino is drained by the &quot;Reno di Medel&quot;, which crosses the geomorphologic Alpine main ridge from the south. All streams in the source area are partially, sometimes completely, captured and sent to storage reservoirs for the local hydro-electric power plants.

The culminating point of the Anterior Rhine&#x27;s drainage basin is the Piz Russein of the Tödi massif of the Glarus Alps at above sea level. It starts with the creek &quot;Aua da Russein&quot; (lit.: &quot;Water of the Russein&quot;).

In its lower course, the Anterior Rhine flows through a gorge named &quot;Ruinaulta&quot; (Flims Rockslide). The whole stretch of the Anterior Rhine to the Alpine Rhine confluence next to Reichenau in Tamins is accompanied by a long-distance hiking trail called &quot;Senda Sursilvana&quot;.

The Posterior Rhine flows first east-northeast, then north. It flows through the three valleys named Rheinwald, Schams and Domleschg-Heinzenberg. The valleys are separated by the Rofla Gorge and Viamala Gorge. Its sources are located in the Adula Alps (Rheinwaldhorn, Rheinquellhorn, and Güferhorn).

The Avers Rhine joins from the south. One of its headwaters, the &quot;Reno di Lei&quot; (stowed in the Lago di Lei), is partially located in Italy.

Near Sils the Posterior Rhine is joined by the Albula, from the east, from the Albula Pass region. The Albula draws its water mainly from the Landwasser with the Dischmabach as the largest source stream, but almost as much from the Gelgia, which comes down from the Julier Pass.

Numerous larger and smaller tributary rivers bear the name of the &quot;Rhine&quot; or equivalent in various Romansh idioms, including &quot;Rein&quot; or &quot;Ragn&quot;, including:
* Anterior Rhine area: &quot;Rein Anteriur/Vorderrhein&quot;, &quot;Rein da Medel&quot;, &quot;Rein da Tuma&quot;, &quot;Rein da Curnera&quot;, &quot;Rein da Maighels&quot;, &quot;Rein da Cristallina&quot;, &quot;Rein da Nalps&quot;, &quot;Rein da Plattas&quot;, &quot;Rein da Sumvitg&quot;, &quot;Rein da Vigliuts&quot;, &quot;Valser Rhine&quot;
* Posterior Rhine basin: &quot;Rein Posteriur/Hinterrhein&quot;, &quot;Reno di Lei&quot;, &quot;Madrischer Rhein&quot;, &quot;Avers Rhine&quot;, &quot;Jufer Rhein&quot;
* Albula-Landwasser area: In the Dischma valley, near Davos, far east of the Rhine, there&#x27;s a place called &quot;Am Rin&quot; (&quot;Upon Rhine&quot;). A tributary of the Dischma is called &quot;Riner Tälli&quot;. Nearby, on the other side of the Sertig, is the &quot;Rinerhorn&quot;.

===Alpine Rhine===


Next to Reichenau in Tamins the Anterior Rhine and the Posterior Rhine join and form the Alpine Rhine. The river makes a distinctive turn to the north near Chur. This section is nearly 86 km long, and descends from a height of 599 meters to 396 meters. It flows through a wide glacial Alpine valley known as the Rhine Valley (). Near Sargan a natural dam, only a few meters high, prevents it from flowing into the open Sztal valley and then through Lake Walen and Lake Zurich into the Aare. The Alpine Rhine begins in the westernmost part of the Swiss canton of Graubünden, and later forms the border between Switzerland to the west and Liechtenstein and later Austria to the east.

As an effect of human work, it empties into Lake Constance on Austrian territory and not on the border that follows its old natural river bed called &quot;Alter Rhein&quot; ().

The mouth of the Rhine into Lake Constance forms an inland delta. The delta is delimited in the west by the &quot;Alter Rhein&quot; and in the east by the modern canalized section of the Alpine Rhine (). Most of the delta is a nature reserve and bird sanctuary. It includes the Austrian towns of Gaißau, Höchst and Fußach. The natural Rhine originally branched into at least two arms and formed small islands by precipitating sediments. In the local Alemannic dialect, the singular is pronounced &quot;Isel&quot; and this is also the local pronunciation of &quot;Esel&quot; (&quot;Donkey&quot;). Many local fields have an official name containing this element.
A regulation of the Rhine was called for, with an upper canal near Diepoldsau and a lower canal at Fußach, in order to counteract the constant flooding and strong sedimentation in the western Rhine Delta. The Dornbirner Ach had to be diverted, too, and it now flows parallel to the canalized Rhine into the lake. Its water has a darker color than the Rhine; the latter&#x27;s lighter suspended load comes from higher up the mountains. It is expected that the continuous input of sediment into the lake will silt up the lake. This has already happened to the former Lake Tuggenersee.

The cut-off Old Rhine at first formed a swamp landscape. Later an artificial ditch of about two km was dug. It was made navigable to the Swiss town of Rheineck.

=== Lake Constance ===
Lake Constance consists of three bodies of water: the Obersee (&quot;upper lake&quot;), the Untersee (&quot;lower lake&quot;), and a connecting stretch of the Rhine, called the Seerhein (&quot;Lake Rhine&quot;). The lake is situated in Germany, Switzerland and Austria near the Alps. Specifically, its shorelines lie in the German states of Bavaria and Baden-Württemberg, the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, and the Swiss cantons of Thurgau and St. Gallen. The Rhine flows into it from the south following the Swiss-Austrian border. It is located at approximately .

==== Obersee ====

The flow of cold, grey mountain water continues for some distance into the lake. The cold water flows near the surface and at first does not mix with the warmer, green waters of Upper Lake. But then, at the so-called &quot;Rheinbrech&quot;, the Rhine water abruptly falls into the depths because of the greater density of cold water. The flow reappears on the surface at the northern (German) shore of the lake, off the island of Lindau. The water then follows the northern shore until Hagnau am Bodensee. A small fraction of the flow is diverted off the island of Mainau into Lake Überlingen. Most of the water flows via the &quot;Constance hopper&quot; into the &quot;Rheinrinne&quot; (&quot;Rhine Gutter&quot;) and Seerhein. Depending on the water level, this flow of the Rhine water is clearly visible along the entire length of the lake.

The Rhine carries very large amounts of debris into the lakeover annually. In the mouth region, it is therefore necessary to permanently remove gravel by dredging. The large sediment loads are partly due to the extensive land improvements upstream.

Three countries border the Obersee, namely Switzerland in the south, Austria in the southeast and the German states of Bavaria in the northeast and Baden-Württemberg in the north and northwest.

==== Seerhein ====

The Seerhein is only long. It connects the Obersee with the 30 cm lower Untersee. Distance markers along the Rhine measure the distance from the bridge in the old city center of Konstanz.

For most of its length, the Seerhein forms the border between Germany and Switzerland. The exception is the old city center of Konstanz, on the Swiss side of the river.

The Seerhein emerged in the last thousands of years, when erosion caused the lake level to be lowered by about 10 meters. Previously, the two lakes formed a single lake, as the name still suggests.

==== Untersee ====

Like in the Obersee, the flow the Rhine can be traced in the Untersee. Here, too, the river water is hardly mixed with the lake water. The northern parts of the Untersee (Lake Zell and Gnadensee) remain virtually unaffected by the flow. The river traverses the southern, which, in isolation, is sometimes called &quot;Rhinesee&quot; (&quot;Lake Rhine&quot;). The &quot;Schweizerische Schifffahrtsgesellschaft Untersee und Rhein&quot; (URh) ofers regular boat trips on Untersee.

Besides the &quot;Seerhein&quot;, the Radolfzeller Aach is the main tributary of &quot;Untersee&quot;. It adds large amounts of water from the Danube system to the &quot;Untersee&quot; via the Danube Sinkhole.

Reichenau Island was formed at the same time as the Seerhein, when the water level fell to its current level.

Lake Untersee is part of the border between Switzerland and Germany, with Germany on the north bank and Switzerland on the south, except both sides are Swiss in Stein am Rhein, where the High Rhine flows out of the lake.

===High Rhine===

The High Rhine () begins in Stein am Rhein at the western end of the Untersee. Now flowing generally westwards, it passes over the Rhine Falls () below Schaffhausen before being joinednear Koblenz in the canton of Aargauby its major tributary, the Aare. The Aare more than doubles the Rhine&#x27;s water discharge, to an average of slightly more than , and provides more than a fifth of the discharge at the Dutch border. The Aare also contains the waters from the summit of Finsteraarhorn, the highest point of the Rhine basin.

Between Eglisau and Basel, the vast majority of its length, the High Rhine forms the border between Germany and Switzerland. Only for brief distances at its extremities does the river run entirely within Switzerland; at the eastern end it separates the bulk of the canton of Schaffhausen and the German exclave of Büsingen am Hochrhein on the northern bank from cantons of Zürich and Thurgau, while at the western end it bisects the canton of Basel-Stadt. Here, at the Rhine knee, the river turns north and leaves Switzerland altogether.

The High Rhine is characterized by numerous dams. On the few remaining natural sections, there are still several rapids. Over its entire course from Lake Constance to the Swiss border at Basel the river descends from .

There are passenger boat lines on the lower High Rhine and between Schaffhausen and Kreuzlingen.

=== Upper Rhine ===

In the center of Basel, the first major city in the course of the stream, is the Rhine knee, a major bend, where the overall direction of the Rhine changes from west to north. Here the High Rhine ends. Legally, the Central Bridge is the boundary between High and Upper Rhine. The river now flows north as Upper Rhine through the Upper Rhine Plain, which is about 300 km long and up to 40 km wide. The most important tributaries in this area are the Ill below of Strasbourg, the Neckar in Mannheim and the Main across from Mainz. In Mainz, the Rhine leaves the Upper Rhine Valley and flows through the Mainz Basin.

The southern half of the Upper Rhine forms the border between France (Alsace) and Germany (Baden-Württemberg). The northern part forms the border between the German states of Rhineland-Palatinate in the west on the one hand, and Baden-Württemberg and Hesse on the other hand, in the east and north. A curiosity of this border line is that the parts of the city of Mainz on the right bank of the Rhine were given to Hesse by the occupying forces in 1945.

The Upper Rhine was a significant cultural landscape in Central Europe already in antiquity and during the Middle Ages. Today, the Upper Rhine area hosts many important manufacturing and service industries, particularly in the centers Basel, Strasbourg and Mannheim-Ludwigshafen. Strasbourg is the seat of the European Parliament, and so one of the three European capitals is located on the Upper Rhine.

The Upper Rhine region was changed significantly by a Rhine straightening program in the 19th century. The rate of flow was increased and the ground water level fell significantly. Dead branches were removed by construction workers and the area around the river was made more habitable for humans on flood plains as the rate of flooding decreased sharply. On the French side, the Grand Canal d&#x27;Alsace was dug, which carries a significant part of the river water, and all of the traffic. In some places, there are large compensation pools, for example, the huge &quot;Bassin de compensation de Plobsheim&quot; in Alsace.

The Upper Rhine has undergone significant human change since the 19th century. While it was slightly modified during the Roman occupation, it was not until the emergence of engineers such as Johann Gottfried Tulla that significant modernization efforts changed the shape of the river. Earlier work under Frederick the Great surrounded efforts to ease shipping and construct dams to serve coal transportation. Tulla is considered to have domesticated the Upper Rhine, a domestication that served goals such as reducing stagnant bogs that fostered waterborne diseases, making regions more habitable for human settlement, and reduce high frequency of floods. Not long before Tulla went to work on widening and straightening the river, heavy floods caused significant loss of life. Four diplomatic treaties were signed among German state governments and French regions dealing with the changes proposed along the Rhine, one was &quot;the Treaty for the Rectification of the Rhine flow from Neuberg to Dettenheim&quot;(1817), which surrounded states such as Bourbon France and the Bavarian Palatinate. Loops, oxbows, branches and islands were removed along the Upper Rhine so that there would be uniformity to the river. The engineering of the Rhine was not without protest, farmers and fishermen had grave concerns about valuable fishing areas and farmland being lost. While some areas lost ground, other areas saw swamps and bogs be drained and turned into arable land. Johann Tulla had the goal of shortening and straightening the Upper Rhine. Early engineering projects the Upper Rhine also had issues, with Tulla&#x27;s project at one part of the river creating rapids, after the Rhine cut down from erosion to sheer rock. Engineering along the Rhine eased flooding and made transportation along the river less cumbersome. These state projects were part of the advanced and technical progress going on in the country alongside the industrial revolution. For the German state, making the river more predictable was to ensure development projects could easily commence.

The section of the Upper Rhine downstream from Mainz is also known as the &quot;Island Rhine&quot;. Here a number of river islands occur, locally known as &quot;Rheinauen&quot;.

=== Middle Rhine ===
The Rhine is the longest river in Germany. It is here that the Rhine encounters some more of its main tributaries, such as the Neckar, the Main and, later, the Moselle, which contributes an average discharge of more than . Northeastern France drains to the Rhine via the Moselle; smaller rivers drain the Vosges and Jura Mountains uplands. Most of Luxembourg and a very small part of Belgium also drain to the Rhine via the Moselle. As it approaches the Dutch border, the Rhine has an annual mean discharge of and an average width of .

Between Bingen am Rhein and Bonn, the Middle Rhine flows through the Rhine Gorge, a formation which was created by erosion. The rate of erosion equaled the uplift in the region, such that the river was left at about its original level while the surrounding lands raised. The gorge is quite deep and is the stretch of the river which is known for its many castles and vineyards. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site (2002) and known as &quot;the Romantic Rhine&quot;, with more than 40 castles and fortresses from the Middle Ages and many quaint and lovely country villages.

The Mainz Basin ends in Bingen am Rhein; the Rhine continues as &quot;Middle Rhine&quot; into the Rhine Gorge in the Rhenish Slate Mountains. In this sections the river falls from 77.4 m above sea level to 50.4 m. On the left, is located the mountain ranges of Hunsrück and Eifel, on the right Taunus and Westerwald. According to geologists, the characteristic narrow valley form was created by erosion by the river while the surrounding landscape was lifted (see water gap).

Major tributaries in this section are the Lahn and the Moselle. They join the Rhine near Koblenz, for the right and left respectively. Almost the entire length of the Middle Rhine runs in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

The dominant economic sectors in the Middle Rhine area are viniculture and tourism. The Rhine Gorge between Rüdesheim am Rhein and Koblenz is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Near Sankt Goarshausen, the Rhine flows around the famous rock Lorelei. With its outstanding architectural monuments, the slopes full of vines, settlements crowded on the narrow river banks and scores of castles lined up along the top of the steep slopes, the Middle Rhine Valley can be considered the epitome of the Rhine romanticism.

=== Lower Rhine ===


In Bonn, where the Sieg flows into the Rhine, the Rhine enters the North German Plain and turns into the Lower Rhine. The Lower Rhine falls from 50 m to 12 m. The main tributaries on this stretch are the Ruhr and the Lippe. Like the Upper Rhine, the Lower Rhine used to meander until engineering created a solid river bed. Because the levees are some distance from the river, at high tide the Lower Rhine has more room for widening than the Upper Rhine.

The Lower Rhine flows through North Rhine-Westphalia. Its banks are usually heavily populated and industrialized, in particular the agglomerations Cologne, Düsseldorf and Ruhr area. Here the Rhine flows through the largest conurbation in Germany, the Rhine-Ruhr region. One of the most important cities in this region is Duisburg with the largest river port in Europe (Duisport). The region downstream of Duisburg is more agricultural. In Wesel, 30 km downstream of Duisburg, is located the western end of the second east–west shipping route, the Wesel-Datteln Canal, which runs parallel to the Lippe. Between Emmerich and Cleves the Emmerich Rhine Bridge, the longest suspension bridge in Germany, crosses the river. Near Krefeld, the river crosses the Uerdingen line, the line which separates the areas where Low German and High German are spoken. The Rhine River is crossed by several ferries, including the one between Bad Honnef and Rolandseck, where the Lohfelderfähre district is situated.

Until the early 1980s, industry was a major source of water pollution. Although many plants and factories can be found along the Rhine up into Switzerland, it is along the Lower Rhine that the bulk of them are concentrated, as the river passes the major cities of Cologne, Düsseldorf and Duisburg. Duisburg is the home of Europe&#x27;s largest inland port and functions as a hub to the sea ports of Rotterdam, Antwerp and Amsterdam. The Ruhr, which joins the Rhine in Duisburg, is nowadays a clean river, thanks to a combination of stricter environmental controls, a transition from heavy industry to light industry and cleanup measures, such as the reforestation of Slag and brownfields. The Ruhr currently provides the region with drinking water. It contributes to the Rhine. Other rivers in the Ruhr Area include the Emscher.

=== Delta ===


The Dutch name for Rhine is &quot;Rijn&quot;. The Rhine turns west and enters the Netherlands, where, together with the rivers Meuse and Scheldt, it forms the extensive Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta, with the largest river delta in Europe. Crossing the border into the Netherlands at Spijk, close to Nijmegen and Arnhem, the Rhine is at its widest, although the river then splits into three main distributaries: the Waal, Nederrijn (&quot;Nether Rhine&quot;) and IJssel.

From here, the situation becomes more complicated, as the Dutch name &quot;Rijn&quot; no longer coincides with the main flow of water. Two-thirds of the water flow volume of the Rhine flows farther west, through the Waal and then, via the Merwede and Nieuwe Merwede (De Biesbosch), merging with the Meuse, through the Hollands Diep and Haringvliet estuaries, into the North Sea. The Beneden Merwede branches off, near Hardinxveld-Giessendam and continues as the Noord, to join the Lek, near the village of Kinderdijk, to form the Nieuwe Maas; then flows past Rotterdam and continues via Het Scheur and the Nieuwe Waterweg, to the North Sea. The Oude Maas branches off, near Dordrecht, farther down rejoining the Nieuwe Maas to form Het Scheur.

The other third of the water flows through the Pannerdens Kanaal and redistributes in the IJssel and Nederrijn. The IJssel branch carries one ninth of the water flow of the &quot;Rhine&quot; north into the IJsselmeer (a former bay), while the Nederrijn carries approximately two-ninths of the flow west along a route parallel to the Waal. However, at Wijk bij Duurstede, the Nederrijn changes its name and becomes the Lek. It flows farther west, to rejoin the Noord into the Nieuwe Maas and to the North Sea.

The name &quot;Rijn&quot;, from here on, is used only for smaller streams farther to the north, which together formed the main river Rhine in Roman times. Though they retained the name, these streams no longer carry water from the Rhine, but are used for draining the surrounding land and polders. From Wijk bij Duurstede, the old north branch of the Rhine is called Kromme Rijn (&quot;Bent Rhine&quot;) past Utrecht, first Leidse Rijn (&quot;Rhine of Leiden&quot;) and then, Oude Rijn (&quot;Old Rhine&quot;). The latter flows west into a sluice at Katwijk, where its waters can be discharged into the North Sea. This branch once formed the line along which the Limes Germanicus were built. During periods of lower sea levels within the various ice ages, the Rhine took a left turn, creating the Channel River, the course of which now lies below the English Channel.

The Rhine-Meuse Delta, the most important natural region of the Netherlands begins near Millingen aan de Rijn, close to the Dutch-German border with the division of the Rhine into Waal and Nederrijn. The region between the Dutch-German border and Rotterdam, where the Waal, Lek, and Meuse run more or less parallel, is colloquially known as the &quot;Great Rivers&quot;. Since the Rhine contributes most of the water, the shorter term &quot;Rhine Delta&quot; is commonly used. However, this name is also used for the river delta where the Rhine flows into Lake Constance, so it is clearer to call the larger one &quot;Rhine-Meuse delta&quot;, or even &quot;Rhine–Meuse–Scheldt delta&quot;, as the Scheldt ends in the same delta.

The shape of the Rhine delta is determined by two bifurcations: first, at Millingen aan de Rijn, the Rhine splits into Waal and Pannerdens Kanaal, which changes its name to Nederrijn at Angeren, and second near Arnhem, the IJssel branches off from the Nederrijn. This creates three main flows, two of which change names rather often. The largest and southern main branch begins as Waal and continues as Boven Merwede (&quot;Upper Merwede&quot;), Beneden Merwede (&quot;Lower Merwede&quot;), Noord (&quot;the North&quot;), Nieuwe Maas (&quot;New Meuse&quot;), Het Scheur (&quot;the Rip&quot;) and Nieuwe Waterweg (&quot;New Waterway&quot;). The middle flow begins as Nederrijn, then changes into Lek, then joins the Noord, thereby forming Nieuwe Maas. The northern flow keeps the name IJssel until it flows into Lake IJsselmeer. Three more flows carry significant amounts of water: the Nieuwe Merwede (&quot;New Merwede&quot;), which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from Boven to Beneden Merwede; the Oude Maas (&quot;Old Meuse&quot;), which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from Beneden Merwede into Noord, and Dordtse Kil, which branches off from Oude Maas.

Before the St. Elizabeth&#x27;s flood (1421), the Meuse flowed just south of today&#x27;s line Merwede-Oude Maas to the North Sea and formed an archipelago-like estuary with Waal and Lek. This system of numerous bays, estuary-like extended rivers, many islands and constant changes of the coastline, is hard to imagine today. From 1421 to 1904, the Meuse and Waal merged further upstream at Gorinchem to form Merwede. For flood protection reasons, the Meuse was separated from the Waal through a lock and diverted into a new outlet called &quot;Bergse Maas&quot;, then Amer and then flows into the former bay Hollands Diep.

The northwestern part of the estuary (around Hook of Holland), is still called &quot;Maasmond&quot; (&quot;Meuse Mouth&quot;), ignoring the fact that it now carries only water from the Rhine. This might explain the confusing naming of the various branches.

The hydrography of the current delta is characterized by the delta&#x27;s main arms, disconnected arms (Hollandse IJssel, Linge, Vecht, etc.) and smaller rivers and streams. Many rivers have been closed (&quot;dammed&quot;) and now serve as drainage channels for the numerous polders. The construction of Delta Works changed the Delta in the second half of the 20th century fundamentally. Currently Rhine water runs into the sea, or into former marine bays now separated from the sea, in five places, namely at the mouths of the Nieuwe Merwede, Nieuwe Waterway (Nieuwe Maas), Dordtse Kil, Spui and IJssel.

The Rhine-Meuse Delta is a tidal delta, shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers, but also by tidal currents. This meant that high tide formed a serious risk because strong tidal currents could tear huge areas of land into the sea. Before the construction of the Delta Works, tidal influence was palpable up to Nijmegen, and even today, after the regulatory action of the Delta Works, the tide acts far inland. At the Waal, the most landward tidal influence can be detected between Brakel and Zaltbommel.

==Geologic history==

===Alpine orogeny===
The Rhine flows from the Alps to the North Sea Basin. The geography and geology of its present-day watershed has been developing since the Alpine orogeny began.

In southern Europe, the stage was set in the Triassic Period of the Mesozoic Era, with the opening of the Tethys Ocean, between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates, between about 240 MBP and 220 MBP (million years before present). The present Mediterranean Sea descends from this somewhat larger Tethys sea. At about 180 MBP, in the Jurassic Period, the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the Tethys floor, causing it to be subducted under Eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the Alpine Orogeny of the Oligocene and Miocene Periods. Several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally, generating the individual features of Mediterranean geography: Iberia pushed up the Pyrenees; Italy, the Alps, and Anatolia, moving west, the mountains of Greece and the islands. The compression and orogeny continue today, as shown by the ongoing raising of the mountains a small amount each year and the active volcanoes.

In northern Europe, the North Sea Basin had formed during the Triassic and Jurassic periods and continued to be a sediment receiving basin since. In between the zone of Alpine orogeny and North Sea Basin subsidence, highlands resulting from an earlier orogeny (Variscan) remained, such as the Ardennes, Eifel and Vosges.

From the Eocene onward, the ongoing Alpine orogeny caused a north–south rift system to develop in this zone. The main elements of this rift are the Upper Rhine Graben, in southwest Germany and eastern France and the Lower Rhine Embayment, in northwest Germany and the southeastern Netherlands. By the time of the Miocene, a river system had developed in the Upper Rhine Graben, that continued northward and is considered the first Rhine river. At that time, it did not yet carry discharge from the Alps; instead, the watersheds of the Rhone and Danube drained the northern flanks of the Alps.

===Stream capture===
The watershed of the Rhine reaches into the Alps today, but it did not start out that way. In the Miocene period, the watershed of the Rhine reached south, only to the Eifel and Westerwald hills, about north of the Alps. The Rhine then had the Sieg as a tributary, but not yet the Moselle. The northern Alps were then drained by the Danube.

Through stream capture, the Rhine extended its watershed southward. By the Pliocene period, the Rhine had captured streams down to the Vosges Mountains, including the Main and the Neckar. The northern Alps were then drained by the Rhone. By the early Pleistocene period, the Rhine had captured most of its current Alpine watershed from the Rhône, including the Aare. Since that time, the Rhine has added the watershed above Lake Constance (Vorderrhein, Hinterrhein, Alpenrhein; captured from the Rhône), the upper reaches of the Main, beyond Schweinfurt and the Moselle in the Vosges Mountains, captured during the Saale Ice-age from the Meuse, to its watershed.

Around 2.5 million years ago (ending 11,600 years ago) the Ice Ages began. Since approximately 600,000 years ago, six major glacial periods have occurred, in which sea level dropped as much as and much of the continental margins were exposed. In the Early Pleistocene, the Rhine followed a course to the northwest, through the present North Sea. During the so-called Anglian glaciation (~450,000 yr BP, marine oxygen isotope stage 12), the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed, that overflowed through the English Channel. This caused the Rhine&#x27;s course to be diverted through the English Channel. Since then, during glacial times, the river mouth was located offshore of Brest, France and rivers, like the River Thames and the Seine, became tributaries to the Rhine. During interglacials, when sea level rose to approximately the present level, the Rhine built deltas in what is now the Netherlands.

The most recent glacial period ran from ~74,000 (BP = Before Present), until the end of the Pleistocene (~11,600 BP). In northwest Europe, it saw two very cold phases, peaking around 70,000 BP and around 29,000–24,000 BP. The last phase slightly predates the global last ice age maximum (Last Glacial Maximum). During this time, the lower Rhine flowed roughly west through the Netherlands and extended to the southwest, through the English Channel and finally, to the Atlantic Ocean. The English Channel, the Irish Channel and most of the North Sea were dry land, mainly because sea level was approximately lower than today.

Most of the Rhine&#x27;s current course was not under the ice during the last Ice Age; although, its source must still have been a glacier. A tundra, with Ice Age flora and fauna, stretched across middle Europe, from Asia to the Atlantic Ocean. Such was the case during the Last Glacial Maximum, ca. 22,000–14,000 yr BP, when ice-sheets covered Scandinavia, the Baltics, Scotland and the Alps, but left the space between as open tundra. Loess (wind-blown topsoil dust) arose from the south and North Sea plain settling on the slopes of the Alps, Urals and the Rhine Valley, rendering the valleys facing the prevailing winds especially fertile.

===End of the last glacial period===
As northwest Europe slowly began to warm from 22,000 years ago onward, frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers began to thaw and fall-winter snow covers melted in spring. Much of the discharge was routed to the Rhine and its downstream extension. Rapid warming and changes of vegetation, to open forest, began about 13,000 BP. By 9000 BP, Europe was fully forested. With globally shrinking ice-cover, ocean water levels rose and the English Channel and North Sea re-inundated. Meltwater, adding to the ocean and land subsidence, drowned the former coasts of Europe transgressionally.

About 11000 years ago, the Rhine estuary was in the Strait of Dover. There remained some dry land in the southern North Sea, known as Doggerland, connecting mainland Europe to Britain. About 9000 years ago, that last divide was overtopped / dissected. Humans were already resident in the area when these events happened.

Since 7500 years ago the situation of tides, currents and land-forms has resembled the present. Rates of sea level rise dropped such that natural sedimentation by the Rhine and coastal processes widely compensate for transgression by the sea. In the southern North Sea, due to ongoing tectonic subsidence, the coastline and sea bed are sinking at the rate of about per century (1 meter or 39 inches in last 3000 years).

About 7000–5000 BP, a general warming encouraged migration of all former ice-locked areas, including up the Danube and down the Rhine by peoples to the east. A sudden massive expansion of the Black Sea as the Mediterranean Sea burst into it through the Bosporus may have occurred about 7500 BP.

===Holocene delta===
At the beginning of the Holocene (~11,700 years ago), the Rhine occupied its Late-Glacial valley. As a meandering river, it reworked its ice-age floodplain. As sea-level rise continued in the Netherlands, the formation of the Holocene Rhine-Meuse delta began (~8,000 years ago). Coeval absolute sea-level rise and tectonic subsidence have strongly influenced delta evolution. Other factors of importance to the shape of the delta are the local tectonic activities of the Peel Boundary Fault, the substrate and geomorphology, as inherited from the Last Glacial period and the coastal-marine dynamics, such as barrier and tidal inlet formations.

Since ~3000 yr BP (= years Before Present), human impact is seen in the delta. As a result of increasing land clearance (Bronze Age agriculture), in the upland areas (central Germany), the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up. This has caused increased flooding and sedimentation, ending peat formation in the delta. In the geologically recent past the main process distributing sediment across the delta has been the shifting of river channels to new locations on the floodplain (termed avulsion). Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred. Direct human impact in the delta began with the mining of peat for salt and fuel from Roman times onward. This was followed by embankment of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries, which took place in the 11–13th century AD. Thereafter, canals were dug, bends were straightened and groynes were built to prevent the river&#x27;s channels from migrating or silting up.

At present, the branches Waal and Nederrijn-Lek discharge to the North Sea through the former Meuse estuary, near Rotterdam. The river IJssel branch flows to the north and enters the IJsselmeer (formerly the Zuider Zee), initially a brackish lagoon but a freshwater lake since 1932. The discharge of the Rhine is divided into three branches: the Waal (6/9 of total discharge), the Nederrijn – Lek (2/9 of total discharge) and the IJssel (1/9 of total discharge). This discharge distribution has been maintained since 1709 by river engineering works including the digging of the Pannerdens Kanaal and the installation, in the 20th century, of a series of weirs on the Nederrijn.

==Military and cultural history==

===Antiquity===

The Rhine was not known to Herodotus and first enters the historical period in the 1st century BC in Roman-era geography. At that time, it formed the boundary between Gaul and Germania. &quot;It is estimated that Germanic tribes have been inhabiting the area since 2000 BCE.&quot; [no source]

The Upper Rhine had been part of the areal of the late Hallstatt culture since the 6th century BC, and by the 1st century BC, the areal of the La Tène culture covered almost its entire length, forming a contact zone with the Jastorf culture, i.e. the locus of early Celtic-Germanic cultural contact.

In Roman geography, the Rhine formed the boundary between &quot;Gallia&quot; and &quot;Germania&quot; by definition; e.g. Maurus Servius Honoratus, &quot;Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil&quot; (8.727) &quot;(Rhenus) fluvius Galliae, qui Germanos a Gallia dividit&quot; &quot;(The Rhine is a) river of Gaul, which divides the Germanic people from Gaul.&quot;

In Roman geography, the Rhine and Hercynia Silva were considered the boundary of the civilized world; as it was a wilderness, the Romans were eager to explore it. This view is typified by &quot;Res Gestae Divi Augusti&quot;, a long public inscription of Augustus, in which he boasts of his exploits; including, sending an expeditionary fleet north of the Rheinmouth, to Old Saxony and Jutland, which he claimed no Roman had ever done before.

Augustus ordered his stepson Roman general Drusus to establish 50 military camps along the Rhine, starting the Germanic Wars in 12 BC. At this time, the plain of the Lower Rhine was the territory of the Ubii. The first urban settlement, on the grounds of what is today Downtown Cologne, along the Rhine, was &quot;Oppidum Ubiorum&quot;, which was founded in 38 BC by the Ubii. Cologne became acknowledged, as a city by the Romans in AD 50, by the name of &quot;Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium&quot;.

From the death of Augustus in AD 14 until after AD 70, Rome accepted as her Germanic frontier the water-boundary of the Rhine and upper Danube. Beyond these rivers she held only the fertile plain of Frankfurt, opposite the Roman border fortress of Moguntiacum (Mainz), the southernmost slopes of the Black Forest and a few scattered bridge-heads. The northern section of this frontier, where the Rhine is deep and broad, remained the Roman boundary until the empire fell. The southern part was different. The upper Rhine and upper Danube are easily crossed. The frontier which they form is inconveniently long, enclosing an acute-angled wedge of foreign territory between the modern Baden and Württemberg. The Germanic populations of these lands seem in Roman times to have been scanty, and Roman subjects from the modern Alsace-Lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards.

The Romans kept eight legions in five bases along the Rhine. The number was reduced to four as more units were moved to the Danube. The actual number of legions present at any base or in all, depended on whether a state or threat of war existed. Between about AD 14 and 180, the assignment of legions was as follows:

For the army of Germania Inferior, two legions at Vetera (Xanten), &quot;I Germanica&quot; and &quot;XX Valeria&quot; (Pannonian troops); two legions at oppidum Ubiorum (&quot;town of the Ubii&quot;), which was renamed to Colonia Agrippina, descending to Cologne, &quot;V Alaudae&quot;, a Celtic legion recruited from Gallia Narbonensis and &quot;XXI&quot;, possibly a Galatian legion from the other side of the empire.

For the army of Germania Superior: one legion, &quot;II Augusta&quot;, at Argentoratum (Strasbourg); and one, &quot;XIII Gemina&quot;, at Vindonissa (Windisch). Vespasian had commanded II Augusta, before he became emperor. In addition, were a double legion, XIV and XVI, at Moguntiacum (Mainz).

The two original military districts of Germania Inferior and Germania Superior, came to influence the surrounding tribes, who later respected the distinction in their alliances and confederations. For example, the upper Germanic peoples combined into the Alemanni. For a time, the Rhine ceased to be a border, when the Franks crossed the river and occupied Roman-dominated Celtic Gaul, as far as Paris.

Germanic tribes crossed the Rhine in the Migration period, by the 5th century establishing the kingdoms of Francia on the Lower Rhine, Burgundy on the Upper Rhine and Alemannia on the High Rhine. This &quot;Germanic Heroic Age&quot; is reflected in medieval legend, such as the which tells of the hero Siegfried killing a dragon on the Drachenfels (Siebengebirge) (&quot;dragons rock&quot;), near Bonn at the Rhine and of the Burgundians and their court at Worms, at the Rhine and Kriemhild&#x27;s golden treasure, which was thrown into the Rhine by Hagen.

===Medieval and modern history===
By the 6th century, the Rhine was within the borders of Francia. In the 9th, it formed part of the border between Middle and Eastern Francia, but in the 10th century, it was fully within the Holy Roman Empire, flowing through Swabia, Franconia and Lower Lorraine. The mouths of the Rhine, in the county of Holland, fell to the Burgundian Netherlands in the 15th century; Holland remained contentious territory throughout the European wars of religion and the eventual collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, when the length of the Rhine fell to the First French Empire and its client states. The Alsace on the left banks of the Upper Rhine was sold to Burgundy by Archduke Sigismund of Austria in 1469 and eventually fell to France in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The numerous historic castles in Rhineland-Palatinate attest to the importance of the river as a commercial route.
Since the Peace of Westphalia, the Upper Rhine formed a contentious border between France and Germany. Establishing &quot;natural borders&quot; on the Rhine was a long-term goal of French foreign policy, since the Middle Ages, though the language border was – and is – far more to the west. French leaders, such as Louis XIV and Napoleon Bonaparte, tried with varying degrees of success to annex lands west of the Rhine. The Confederation of the Rhine was established by Napoleon, as a French client state, in 1806 and lasted until 1814, during which time it served as a significant source of resources and military manpower for the First French Empire. In 1840, the Rhine crisis, prompted by French prime minister Adolphe Thiers desire to reinstate the Rhine as a natural border, led to a diplomatic crisis and a wave of nationalism in Germany. 

The Rhine became an important symbol in German nationalism during the formation of the German state in the 19th century (see Rhine romanticism).
* The song &quot;Die Wacht am Rhein&quot;, which almost became a national anthem.
* &quot;Das Rheingold&quot; – inspired by the , the Rhine is one of the settings for the first opera of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;. The action of the epic opens and ends underneath the Rhine, where three Rheinmaidens swim and protect a hoard of gold.
* The Loreley/Lorelei is a rock on the eastern bank of the Rhine, that is associated with several legendary tales, poems and songs. The river spot has a reputation for being a challenge for inexperienced navigators.

At the end of World War I, the Rhineland was subject to the Treaty of Versailles. This decreed that it would be occupied by the allies, until 1935 and after that, it would be a demilitarized zone, with the German army forbidden to enter. The Treaty of Versailles and this particular provision, in general, caused much resentment in Germany. The Allies&#x27; troops left the Rhineland in 1930 and, following the rise to power of Adolf Hitler, the German army re-occupied it in 1936, which proved an enormously popular action in Germany. Although the Allies could probably have prevented the reoccupation, Britain and France were not inclined to do so, a feature of their policy of appeasement to Hitler.
In World War II, it was recognized that the Rhine would present a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of Germany, by the Western Allies. The Rhine bridge at Arnhem, immortalized in the book, &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; and the film, was a central focus of the battle of Arnhem, during the failed Operation Market Garden of September 1944. The bridges at Nijmegen, over the Waal distributary of the Rhine, were also an objective of Operation Market Garden. In a separate operation, the Ludendorff Bridge, crossing the Rhine at Remagen, became famous, when U.S. forces were able to capture it intact – much to their own surprise – after the Germans failed to demolish it. This also became the subject of a film, &quot;The Bridge at Remagen&quot;.
&quot;Seven Days to the River Rhine&quot; was a Warsaw Pact war plan for an invasion of Western Europe during the Cold War.

Until 1932, the generally accepted length of the Rhine was . In 1932 the German encyclopedia Knaurs Lexikon stated the length as , presumably a typographical error. 
After this number was placed into the authoritative Brockhaus Enzyklopädie, it became generally accepted and found its way into numerous textbooks and official publications. The error was discovered in 2010, and the Dutch Rijkswaterstaat confirms the length at .

===Countries and borders===

During its course from the Alps to the North Sea, the Rhine passes through four countries and constitutes six different country borders. On the various parts:
* the Anterior Rhine lies entirely within Switzerland, while at least one tributary to Posterior Rhine, &quot;Reno di Lei&quot; originates in Italy, but is not considered a part of the Rhine proper.
* the Alpine Rhine flows within Switzerland till Sargans, from which it becomes the border between Switzerland (to the west) and Liechtenstein (to the east) until Oberriet, and the river never flows within Liechtenstein. It then becomes the border between Switzerland (to the west) and Austria (to the east) until Diepoldsau where the modern and straight course enters Switzerland, while the original course &quot;Alter Rhein&quot; makes a bend to the east and continues as the Swiss-Austrian border until the confluence at Widnau. From here the river continues as the border until Lustenau, where the modern and straight course enters Austria (the only part of the river that flows within Austria), while the original course makes a bend to the west and continues as the border, until both courses enter Lake Constance.
* the first half of &quot;Seerhein&quot;, between the upper and lower body of Lake Constance, flows within Germany (and the city of Konstanz), while the second is the German (to the north) – Swiss (to the south) frontier.
* the first parts of the High Rhine, from Lake Constance to Altholz, the river alternates flowing within Switzerland and being the German-Swiss frontier (three times each). From Altholz the river is the German-Swiss border until Basel, where it enters Switzerland for the last time.
* the Upper Rhine is the border between France (to the west) and Switzerland (to the east) for a short distance, from Basel to Hunningue. Here it becomes the Franco (to the west) – German (to the east) frontier until Au am Rhein. Hence, the main course of the Rhine never flows within France, although some river canals do. From Au am Rhein the river flows within Germany.
* the Middle Rhine flows entirely within Germany.
* the Lower Rhine flows within Germany until Emmerich am Rhein, where it becomes the border between The Netherlands (to the north) and Germany (to the south). At Millingen aan de Rijn the river enters the Netherlands.
* all parts of the Delta Rhein flows within the Netherlands until they enter the North Sea, IJsselmeer (IJssel) or Haringvliet (Waal) at the Dutch coast.

* Hollandse IJssel (formed after Roman times, dammed in the 13th century AD)
* Linge (big channel in Roman times, dammed in the 14th century AD)

<doc id="25848" wikidata="Q639934" url="?curid=25848" title="Rungholt">
<text>Rungholt was a low-lying settlement in North Frisia, in what was then the Danish Duchy of Schleswig. The area today lies in Germany. Rungholt was flooded, with massive erosion, when a storm tide (known as &quot;Grote Mandrenke&quot; or &quot;Den Store Manddrukning&quot;) hit the coast on 15 or 16 January 1362.

==Location==
Rungholt was situated on the island of Strand, which was largely destroyed by the Burchardi Flood of 1634; remaining fragments include the Nordstrand peninsula and the islets of Hallig Südfall, Pellworm and Nordstrandischmoor, while the rest now forms tidal flats in the surrounding Wadden Sea.

In 1921, ruins believed to represent Rungholt were discovered around Hallig Südfall: wells, trenches and part of a tidal lock. In June 2023, the German Research Foundation announced that researchers had confirmed this identification, and had already mapped 10 square kilometers of the area including key features such as a church. Detailed archeological investigations of the remains of buildings, dykes and a harbour have been published.

==History==

Documents about Rungholt mostly date from much later times (16th century). Archaeologists think Rungholt was an important town and port. It might have contained up to 500 houses, with about 3,000 people. Findings indicate trade in agricultural products and possibly amber.

The great storm known as the &quot;Grote Mandrenke&quot; (&quot;Store Manddrukning&quot;), sometimes also named after the saint Marcellus, occurred on 15 or 16 January 1362. Estimates put the number of deaths at around 25,000. Possibly 30 settlements were destroyed, and the coastline shifted east, leaving formerly inhabited land in the tidal Wadden Sea.

The vulnerability of the settlement to the storm tide has been attributed to agricultural development: &quot;It was like a natural landscape of peat bogs and fenland. It was very uninhabitable, and they completely colonized it. They completely changed the landscape,&quot; ... &quot;Once you remove all this peat and get the water out, you have very, very rich soils that are perfect for agriculture [but] &quot;with rising sea levels and increasing storminess, one day these dikes they built were not sufficient enough, and these settlements just drowned.&quot;

==Legends and later reception==
Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Atlantis of the North Sea&quot;, the Rungholt of legend was a large, rich town, with the catastrophe supposedly a divine punishment for the sins of its inhabitants.

Impressed by the fate of the town, the relics, and not least the legends&#x27; excessive descriptions, the German poet Detlev von Liliencron wrote the 1882 poem &quot;Trutz, Blanke Hans&quot; about the lost town, which begins: &quot;Heut bin ich über Rungholt gefahren, die Stadt ging unter vor sechshundert Jahren.&quot; (&quot;Today I traveled over Rungholt; the town sank 600 years ago.&quot;).

The Sinbadventurers (German: Die Hamburger Sindbadauken) is an opera for children composed by with a libretto by Francis Hüsers. It was commissioned by the Hamburg State Opera and was first performed on February 8, 2015. In the opera, three children set out to discover the lost gold of Rungholt. In the Interlude before the final act, the main character, Lotte, tries desperately to warn the citizens of Rungholt of their impending destruction by reciting verses from Liliencron’s ballad. 

German singer Achim Reichel put Liliencron&#x27;s poem to music on his 1977 album &quot;&quot;.

German band Santiano released a song called &quot;Rungholt&quot; in their 2015 CD &quot;Von Liebe, Tod und Freiheit&quot;. It also includes verses from von Liliencron&#x27;s poem.

Theodor Storm mentions Rungholt in his novella &quot;Eine Halligfahrt&quot;.

Christian Kracht mentions Rungholt in his novella &quot;Faserland&quot;.

The Danish writer Dorothea Petersen mentions Rungholt in her historical novel &quot;Havets rytter&quot;.

Ursula Hegi mentions Rungholt in her 2020 novel &quot;The Patron Saint of Pregnant Girls&quot;.

Local myth has it that one can still hear the church bells of Rungholt ringing underwater when sailing through the area on a calm night.

<text>Ralph C. Merkle (born February 2, 1952) is an American computer scientist and mathematician. He is one of the inventors of public-key cryptography, the inventor of cryptographic hashing, and more recently a researcher and speaker on cryonics.

Merkle is a renowned cryptographer, known for devising Merkle&#x27;s Puzzles, co-inventing the Merkle–Hellman knapsack cryptosystem, and inventing cryptographic hashing (Merkle–Damgård construction) and Merkle trees. He has worked as a manager at Elxsi, research scientist at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), and a nanotechnology theorist at Zyvex. Merkle has held positions as a Distinguished Professor at Georgia Tech, senior research fellow at IMM, faculty member at Singularity University, and board member at Alcor Life Extension Foundation. He received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal in 2010 and has published works on molecular manipulation and self-replicating machines. Ralph Merkle is a grandnephew of baseball star Fred Merkle and is married to video game designer Carol Shaw. He serves on the board of directors of the cryonics organization Alcor Life Extension Foundation and appears in the science fiction novel &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;.

==Contributions==
While an undergraduate, Merkle devised Merkle&#x27;s Puzzles, a scheme for communication over an insecure channel, as part of a class project at UC Berkeley. The scheme is now recognized to be an early example of public key cryptography. He co-invented the Merkle–Hellman knapsack cryptosystem, invented cryptographic hashing (now called the Merkle–Damgård construction based on a pair of articles published 10 years later that established the security of the scheme), and invented Merkle trees. The Merkle–Damgård construction is at the heart of many hashing algorithms. 
At Xerox PARC Merkle designed the Khufu and Khafre block ciphers and the Snefru hash function.

==Career==
Merkle was the manager of compiler development at Elxsi from 1980. In 1988, he became a research scientist at Xerox PARC. In 1999 he became a nanotechnology theorist for Zyvex. In 2003 he became a Distinguished Professor at Georgia Tech, where he led the Georgia Tech Information Security Center. In 2006 he returned to the San Francisco Bay Area, where he has been a senior research fellow at IMM, a faculty member at Singularity University, and a board member of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation. He was awarded the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal in 2010. He is active in the field of molecular manipulation and self-replicating machines and has published books on the subject.

==Personal life==
Ralph Merkle is a grandnephew of baseball star Fred Merkle; son of Theodore Charles Merkle, director of Project Pluto; and brother of Judith Merkle Riley, a historical writer. Merkle is married to Carol Shaw, the video game designer best known for the 1982 Atari 2600 game &quot;River Raid&quot;.

Merkle is on the board of directors of the cryonics organization Alcor Life Extension Foundation.

Merkle appears in the science fiction novel &quot;The Diamond Age&quot;, involving nanotechnology.

<text>In computability theory, Rice&#x27;s theorem states that all non-trivial semantic properties of programs are undecidable. A &quot;semantic&quot; property is one about the program&#x27;s behavior (for instance, &quot;does the program terminate for all inputs?&quot;), unlike a syntactic property (for instance, &quot;does the program contain an if-then-else statement?&quot;). A &quot;non-trivial&quot; property is one which is neither true for every program, nor false for every program.

The theorem generalizes the undecidability of the halting problem. It has far-reaching implications on the feasibility of static analysis of programs. It implies that it is impossible, for example, to implement a tool that checks whether any given program is correct, or even executes without error (it is possible to implement a tool that always overestimates or always underestimates, so in practice one has to decide what is less of a problem).

The theorem is named after Henry Gordon Rice, who proved it in his doctoral dissertation of 1951 at Syracuse University.

==Introduction==
Rice&#x27;s theorem puts a theoretical bound on which types of static analysis can be performed automatically. One can distinguish between the syntax of a program, and its semantics. The syntax is the detail of how the program is written, or its &quot;intention&quot;, and the semantics is how the program behaves when run, or its &quot;extension&quot;. Rice&#x27;s theorem asserts that it is impossible to decide a property of programs which depends only on the semantics and not on the syntax, unless the property is trivial (true of all programs, or false of all programs).

By Rice&#x27;s theorem, it is impossible to write a program that automatically verifies for the absence of bugs in other programs, taking a program and a specification as input, and checking whether the program satisfies the specification.

This does not imply an impossibility to prevent &quot;certain types&quot; of bugs. For example, Rice&#x27;s theorem implies that in dynamically typed programming languages which are Turing-complete, it is impossible to verify the absence of type errors. On the other hand, statically typed programming languages feature a type system which statically prevents type errors. In essence, this should be understood as a feature of the &quot;syntax&quot; (taken in a broad sense) of those languages. In order to type check a program, its source code must be inspected; the operation does not depend merely on the hypothetical semantics of the program.

In terms of general software verification, this means that although one cannot algorithmically check whether any given program satisfies a given specification, one can require programs to be annotated with extra information that proves the program is correct, or to be written in a particular restricted form that makes the verification possible, and only accept programs which are verified in this way. In the case of type safety, the former corresponds to type annotations, and the latter corresponds to type inference. Taken beyond type safety, this idea leads to correctness proofs of programs through proof annotations such as in Hoare logic.

Another way of working around Rice&#x27;s theorem is to search for methods which catch &quot;many&quot; bugs, without being complete. This is the theory of abstract interpretation.

Yet another direction for verification is model checking, which can only apply to finite-state programs, not to Turing-complete languages.

==Formal statement==
Let &quot;φ&quot; be an admissible numbering of partial computable functions. Let &quot;P&quot; be a subset of formula_1. Suppose that:
# &quot;P&quot; is &quot;non-trivial&quot;: &quot;P&quot; is neither empty nor formula_1 itself.
# &quot;P&quot; is &quot;extensional&quot;: for all integers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, if &quot;φ&quot;&quot;m&quot; = &quot;φ&quot;&quot;n&quot;, then &quot;m&quot; ∈ &quot;P&quot; ⟺ &quot;n&quot; ∈ &quot;P&quot;.
Then &quot;P&quot; is undecidable.

A more concise statement can be made in terms of index sets: The only decidable index sets are ∅ and formula_1.

==Examples==
Given a program &quot;P&quot; which takes a natural number &quot;n&quot; and returns a natural number &quot;P&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), the following questions are undecidable:
* Does &quot;P&quot; terminate on a given &quot;n&quot;? (This is the halting problem.)
* Does &quot;P&quot; terminate on 0?
* Does &quot;P&quot; terminate on &quot;all&quot; &quot;n&quot; (i.e., is &quot;P&quot; total)?
* Does &quot;P&quot; terminate and return 0 on every input?
* Does &quot;P&quot; terminate and return 0 on some input?
* Does &quot;P&quot; terminate and return the same value for all inputs?
* Is &quot;P&quot; equivalent to a given program &quot;Q&quot;?

==Proof by Kleene&#x27;s recursion theorem==
Assume for contradiction that formula_4 is a non-trivial, extensional and computable set of natural numbers. There is a natural number formula_5 and a natural number formula_6. Define a function formula_7 by formula_8 when formula_9 and formula_10 when formula_11. By Kleene&#x27;s recursion theorem, there exists formula_12 such that formula_13. Then, if formula_9, we have formula_15, contradicting the extensionality of formula_4 since formula_6, and conversely, if formula_11, we have formula_19, which again contradicts extensionality since formula_5.

==Proof by reduction from the halting problem==

===Proof sketch===
Suppose, for concreteness, that we have an algorithm for examining a program &quot;p&quot; and determining infallibly whether &quot;p&quot; is an implementation of the squaring function, which takes an integer &quot;d&quot; and returns &quot;d&quot;2. The proof works just as well if we have an algorithm for deciding any other non-trivial property of program behavior (i.e. a semantic and non-trivial property), and is given in general below.

The claim is that we can convert our algorithm for identifying squaring programs into one that identifies functions that halt. We will describe an algorithm that takes inputs &quot;a&quot; and &quot;i&quot; and determines whether program &quot;a&quot; halts when given input &quot;i&quot;.

The algorithm for deciding this is conceptually simple: it constructs (the description of) a new program &quot;t&quot; taking an argument &quot;n&quot;, which (1) first executes program &quot;a&quot; on input &quot;i&quot; (both &quot;a&quot; and &quot;i&quot; being hard-coded into the definition of &quot;t&quot;), and (2) then returns the square of &quot;n&quot;. If &quot;a&quot;(&quot;i&quot;) runs forever, then &quot;t&quot; never gets to step (2), regardless of &quot;n&quot;. Then clearly, &quot;t&quot; is a function for computing squares if and only if step (1) terminates. Since we have assumed that we can infallibly identify programs for computing squares, we can determine whether &quot;t&quot;, which depends on &quot;a&quot; and &quot;i&quot;, is such a program; thus we have obtained a program that decides whether program &quot;a&quot; halts on input &quot;i&quot;. Note that our halting-decision algorithm never executes &quot;t&quot;, but only passes its description to the squaring-identification program, which by assumption always terminates; since the construction of the description of &quot;t&quot; can also be done in a way that always terminates, the halting-decision cannot fail to halt either.

 halts (a,i) {
 define t(n) {
 a(i)
 return n×n
 return is_a_squaring_function(t)

This method does not depend specifically on being able to recognize functions that compute squares; as long as &quot;some&quot; program can do what we are trying to recognize, we can add a call to &quot;a&quot; to obtain our &quot;t&quot;. We could have had a method for recognizing programs for computing square roots, or programs for computing the monthly payroll, or programs that halt when given the input codice_1; in each case, we would be able to solve the halting problem similarly.

===Formal proof===
For the formal proof, algorithms are presumed to define partial functions over strings and are themselves represented by strings. The partial function computed by the algorithm represented by a string &quot;a&quot; is denoted F&quot;a&quot;. This proof proceeds by reductio ad absurdum: we assume that there is a non-trivial property that is decided by an algorithm, and then show that it follows that we can decide the halting problem, which is not possible, and therefore a contradiction.

Let us now assume that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) is an algorithm that decides some non-trivial property of F&quot;a&quot;. Without loss of generality we may assume that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;no-halt&quot;) = &quot;no&quot;, with &quot;no-halt&quot; being the representation of an algorithm that never halts. If this is not true, then this holds for the algorithm &#x27; that computes the negation of the property &quot;P&quot;. Now, since &quot;P&quot; decides a non-trivial property, it follows that there is a string &quot;b&quot; that represents an algorithm F&quot;&#x27;&quot;b&quot; and &quot;P&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) = &quot;yes&quot;. We can then define an algorithm &quot;H&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot;) as follows:

:1. construct a string &quot;t&quot; that represents an algorithm &quot;T&quot;(&quot;j&quot;) such that
:* &quot;T&quot; first simulates the computation of F&quot;a&quot;(&quot;i&quot;),
:* then &quot;T&quot; simulates the computation of F&quot;b&quot;(&quot;j&quot;) and returns its result.
:2. return &quot;P&quot;(&quot;t&quot;).

We can now show that &quot;H&quot; decides the halting problem:
* Assume that the algorithm represented by &quot;a&quot; halts on input &quot;i&quot;. In this case F&quot;t&quot; = F&quot;b&quot; and, because &quot;P&quot;(&quot;b&quot;) = &quot;yes&quot; and the output of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) depends only on F&quot;x&quot;, it follows that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;yes&quot; and, therefore &quot;H&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot;) = &quot;yes&quot;.
* Assume that the algorithm represented by &quot;a&quot; does not halt on input &quot;i&quot;. In this case F&quot;t&quot; = F&quot;no-halt&quot;, i.e., the partial function that is never defined. Since &quot;P&quot;(&quot;no-halt&quot;) = &quot;no&quot; and the output of &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) depends only on F&quot;x&quot;, it follows that &quot;P&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) = &quot;no&quot; and, therefore &quot;H&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot;) = &quot;no&quot;.

Since the halting problem is known to be undecidable, this is a contradiction and the assumption that there is an algorithm &quot;P&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) that decides a non-trivial property for the function represented by &quot;a&quot; must be false.

<text>Recusancy (from ) was the state of those who remained loyal to the Catholic Church and refused to attend Church of England services after the English Reformation.

The 1558 Recusancy Acts passed in the reign of Elizabeth I, and temporarily repealed in the Interregnum (1649–1660), remained on the statute books until 1888. They imposed punishments such as fines, property confiscation and imprisonment on recusants. The suspension under Oliver Cromwell was mainly intended to give relief to nonconforming Protestants rather than to Catholics, to whom some restrictions applied into the 1920s, through the Act of Settlement 1701, despite the 1828–1829 Catholic emancipation.

In some cases those adhering to Catholicism faced capital punishment, and some English and Welsh Catholics who were executed in the 16th and 17th centuries have been canonised by the Catholic Church as martyrs of the English Reformation.

Today, &quot;recusant&quot; applies to the descendants of Roman Catholic families of the British gentry and aristocracy.

==History==
After the English Reformation, from the 16th to the 19th centuries those guilty of such nonconformity, termed &quot;recusants&quot;, were subject to civil penalties and sometimes, especially in the earlier part of that period, to criminal penalties. Catholics formed a large proportion, if not a plurality, of recusants, and it was to Catholics that the term initially was applied. Non-Catholic groups composed of Reformed Christians or Protestant dissenters from the Church of England were later labelled &quot;recusants&quot; as well. Recusancy laws were in force from the reign of Elizabeth I to that of George III, but were not always enforced with equal intensity.

The first statute to address sectarian dissent from England&#x27;s official religion was enacted in 1593 under Elizabeth I and specifically targeted Catholics, under the title &quot;An Act for restraining Popish recusants&quot;. It defined &quot;Popish recusants&quot; as those 

Other Acts targeted Catholic recusants, including statutes passed under JamesI and Charles I, as well as laws defining other offences deemed to be acts of recusancy. Recusants were subject to various civil disabilities and penalties under English penal laws, most of which were repealed during the Regency and the reign of George IV (1811–30). &quot;The Nuttall Encyclopædia&quot; notes that Dissenters were largely forgiven by the Act of Toleration under WilliamIII, while Catholics &quot;were not entirely emancipated till 1829&quot;.

Early recusants included Protestant dissenters, whose confessions derived from the Calvinistic Reformers or Radical Reformers. With the growth of these latter groups after the Restoration of CharlesII, they were distinguished from Catholic recusants by the terms &quot;nonconformist&quot; or &quot;dissenter&quot;. The recusant period reaped an extensive harvest of saints and martyrs.

Among the recusants were some high-profile Catholic aristocrats such as the Howards and, for a time, the Plantagenet-descended Beauforts. This patronage ensured that an organic and rooted English base continued to inform the country&#x27;s Catholicism.

In the English-speaking world, the Douay-Rheims Bible was translated from the Latin Vulgate by expatriate recusants in Rheims, France, in 1582 (New Testament) and in Douai, France in 1609 (Old Testament). It was revised by Bishop Richard Challoner in the years 1749–52. After &quot;Divino afflante Spiritu&quot;, translations multiplied in the Catholic world (just as they multiplied in the Protestant world around the same time beginning with the Revised Standard Version). Various other translations were used by Catholics around the world for English-language liturgies, ranging from the New American Bible and the Jerusalem Bible to the Revised Standard Version Second Catholic Edition.

===Recusant families===

There were dozens of recusant families, some no longer extant. For example, the Howard family, some of whose members are known as Fitzalan-Howard, the Dukes of Norfolk, the highest-ranking non-royal family in England and hereditary holders of the title of Earl Marshal, is considered the most prominent Catholic family in England. Other members of the Howard family, the Earls of Carlisle, Effingham and Suffolk are Anglican, including a cadet branch of the Carlisles who own Castle Howard in Yorkshire. Recusancy was historically focused in Northern England, particularly Cumberland, Lancashire, Yorkshire and Westmoreland. A geographical exception was a branch of the Welds from Shropshire who migrated via London to Oxfordshire and Dorset. The three sons of Sir John Weld (1585–1622), founder of the Weld Chapel in Southgate, all married into recusant families and were technically &quot;converts&quot; in the 1640s. The eldest, Humphrey, began a lineage, referred to as the &quot;Lulworth Welds&quot;. They became connected by marriage to Catholic families across the kingdom, including the Arundells, Blundells, Cliffords, Erringtons, Gillows, Haydocks, Petres, Ropers, Shireburns, Smythes, Stourtons, Throckmortons, Vaughans and Vavasours. The Acton (also known as Dalberg-Acton and Lyon-Dalberg-Acton) family is another well-known recusant family.

===Individuals===

Although William Shakespeare (1564–1616) and his immediate family were conforming members of the established Church of England, Shakespeare&#x27;s mother, Mary Arden, was a member of a particularly conspicuous and determinedly Catholic family in Warwickshire.

Some scholars also believe there is evidence that several members of Shakespeare&#x27;s family were secretly recusant Catholics. The strongest evidence is a tract professing secret Catholicism signed by John Shakespeare, father of the poet. The tract was found in the 18th century in the rafters of a house which had once been John Shakespeare&#x27;s and was seen and described by the reputable scholar Edmond Malone. Malone later changed his mind and declared that he thought the tract was a forgery. Although the document has since been lost, Anthony Holden writes that Malone&#x27;s reported wording of the tract is linked to a testament written by Charles Borromeo and circulated in England by Edmund Campion, copies of which still exist in Italian and English. Other research, however, suggests that the Borromeo testament is a 17th-century artefact (at the earliest dating from 1638), was not printed for missionary work, and could never have been in the possession of John Shakespeare. John Shakespeare was listed as one who did not attend church services, but this was &quot;for feare of processe for Debtte&quot;, according to the commissioners, not because he was a recusant.

Another notable English Catholic, possibly a convert, was composer William Byrd. Some of Byrd&#x27;s most popular &quot;motets&quot; were actually written as a type of correspondence to a friend and fellow composer, Philippe de Monte. De Monte wrote his own motets in response, such as the &quot;Super Flumina Babylonis&quot;. These correspondence motets often featured themes of oppression or the hope of deliverance.

Dorothy Lawson was a Catholic noblewoman who used her autonomy, financial independence and social status as a widow to harbour priests in her household. She was a patroness of the Society of Jesus, who met yearly at her home to discuss the mission in England, employed Catholic servants, held religious services for the local community, and visited recusants who were imprisoned in jail for their beliefs. Her children were raised in the Catholic faith. Three daughters entered convents on the continent and a son attended a seminary in Douai.

The Jacobean poet John Donne was another notable Englishman born into a recusant Catholic family. He later, however, authored two Protestant-leaning writings and, at the behest of King James I, was ordained into the Church of England.

Guy Fawkes, an Englishman and a Spanish soldier, along with other recusants or converts, including, among others, Sir Robert Catesby, Christopher Wright, John Wright and Thomas Percy, was arrested and charged with attempting to blow up Parliament on 5 November 1605. The plot was uncovered and most of the plotters, who were recusants or converts, were tried and executed.

==Other countries==
The term &quot;recusancy&quot; is primarily applied to English, Scottish, and Welsh Catholics, but there were other instances in Europe. The vast majority of native Irish, while subject to the British crown, rejected both the reformed Church of Ireland and the dissenting churches, remaining loyal to the Roman Catholic Church, suffering the same penalties as recusants in Great Britain. The situation was exacerbated by land claims, paramilitary violence, and ethnic antagonisms on all sides.

Recusancy in Scandinavia is not considered to have survived much past the period of the Liturgical Struggle until anti-Catholicism lessened towards the end of the 18th century and freedom of religion was re-established in the mid-19th century (although there were individual cases of Catholic sympathies occurring even in the 17th and 18th centuries). Notable converts were Christina, Queen of Sweden, daughter of Gustavus Adolphus; and Sigrid Undset, Nobel Prize-winning author of &quot;Kristin Lavransdatter&quot;. The number of ethnic Swedes who are Roman Catholic is fewer than 40,000, and includes Anders Arborelius, a convert and the first Swedish bishop since the Reformation. In 2017, he was made a cardinal.

<text>In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a regular grammar is a grammar that is &quot;right-regular&quot; or &quot;left-regular&quot;.
While their exact definition varies from textbook to textbook, they all require that
* all production rules have at most one non-terminal symbol;
* that symbol is either always at the end or always at the start of the rule&#x27;s right-hand side.

Every regular grammar describes a regular language.

== Strictly regular grammars ==

A right-regular grammar (also called right-linear grammar) is a formal grammar (&quot;N&quot;, Σ, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;S&quot;) in which all production rules in &quot;P&quot; are of one of the following forms:
# &quot;A&quot; → &quot;a&quot;
# &quot;A&quot; → &quot;aB&quot;
# &quot;A&quot; → ε
where &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;S&quot; ∈ &quot;N&quot; are non-terminal symbols, &quot;a&quot; ∈ Σ is a terminal symbol, and ε denotes the empty string, i.e. the string of length 0. &quot;S&quot; is called the start symbol.

In a left-regular grammar, (also called left-linear grammar), all rules obey the forms
# &quot;A&quot; → &quot;a&quot;
# &quot;A&quot; → &quot;Ba&quot;
# &quot;A&quot; → ε

The language described by a given grammar is the set of all strings that contain only terminal symbols and can be derived from the start symbol by repeated application of production rules. Two grammars are called weakly equivalent if they describe the same language.

Rules of both kinds must not be mixed; for example, the grammar with rule set { &quot;S&quot;→&quot;aT&quot;, &quot;T&quot;→&quot;Sb&quot;, S→ε } is not regular, and describes the language formula_1, which is not regular, either.

Some textbooks and articles disallow empty production rules, and assume that the empty string is not present in languages.

== Extended regular grammars ==

An &quot;extended right-regular grammar&quot; is one in which all rules obey one of
# &quot;A&quot; → &quot;w&quot;, where &quot;A&quot; is a non-terminal in &quot;N&quot; and &quot;w&quot; is in a (possibly empty) string of terminals Σ*
# &quot;A&quot; → &quot;wB&quot;, where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are in &quot;N&quot; and &quot;w&quot; is in Σ*.

Some authors call this type of grammar a &quot;right-regular grammar&quot; (or &quot;right-linear grammar&quot;) and the type above a &quot;strictly right-regular grammar&quot; (or &quot;strictly right-linear grammar&quot;).

An &quot;extended left-regular grammar&quot; is one in which all rules obey one of
# &quot;A&quot; → &quot;w&quot;, where &quot;A&quot; is a non-terminal in &quot;N&quot; and &quot;w&quot; is in Σ*
# &quot;A&quot; → &quot;Bw&quot;, where &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are in &quot;N&quot; and &quot;w&quot; is in Σ*.

== Examples ==
An example of a right-regular grammar &quot;G&quot; with &quot;N&quot; = {S, A}, Σ = {a, b, c}, &quot;P&quot; consists of the following rules
: S → aS
: S → bA
: A → ε
: A → cA
and S is the start symbol. This grammar describes the same language as the regular expression a*bc*, viz. the set of all strings consisting of arbitrarily many &quot;&quot;a&quot;s, followed by a single &quot;b&quot;, followed by arbitrarily many &quot;c&quot;&quot;s.

A somewhat longer but more explicit extended right-regular grammar &quot;G&quot; for the same regular expression is given by &quot;N&quot; = {S, A, B, C}, Σ = {a, b, c}, where &quot;P&quot; consists of the following rules:
: S → A
: A → aA
: A → B
: B → bC
: C → ε
: C → cC
...where each uppercase letter corresponds to phrases starting at the next position in the regular expression.

As an example from the area of programming languages, the set of all strings denoting a floating point number can be described by an extended right-regular grammar &quot;G&quot; with &quot;N&quot; = {S,A,B,C,D,E,F}, Σ = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,+,−.,e}, where S is the start symbol, and &quot;P&quot; consists of the following rules:

==Expressive power==
There is a direct one-to-one correspondence between the rules of a (strictly) right-regular grammar and those of a nondeterministic finite automaton, such that the grammar generates exactly the language the automaton accepts. Hence, the right-regular grammars generate exactly all regular languages. The left-regular grammars describe the reverses of all such languages, that is, exactly the regular languages as well.

Every strict right-regular grammar is extended right-regular, while every extended right-regular grammar can be made strict by inserting new non-terminals, such that the result generates the same language; hence, extended right-regular grammars generate the regular languages as well. Analogously, so do the extended left-regular grammars.

If empty productions are disallowed, only all regular languages that do not include the empty string can be generated.

While regular grammars can only describe regular languages, the converse is not true: regular languages can also be described by non-regular grammars.

==Mixing left-regular and right-regular rules==
If mixing of left-regular and right-regular rules is allowed, we still have a linear grammar, but not necessarily a regular one.
What is more, such a grammar need not generate a regular language: all linear grammars can be easily brought into this form, and hence, such grammars can generate exactly all linear languages, including non-regular ones.

For instance, the grammar &quot;G&quot; with &quot;N&quot; = {S, A}, Σ = {a, b}, &quot;P&quot; with start symbol &quot;S&quot; and rules
: S → aA
: A → Sb
: S → ε
generates formula_2, the paradigmatic non-regular linear language.

<text>In physics, radiation is the emission or transmission of energy in the form of waves or particles through space or a material medium. This includes:
* &quot;electromagnetic radiation&quot; consisting of photons, such as radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, x-rays, and gamma radiation (γ)
* &quot;particle radiation&quot; consisting of particles of non-zero rest energy, such as alpha radiation (α), beta radiation (β), proton radiation and neutron radiation
* &quot;acoustic radiation&quot;, such as ultrasound, sound, and seismic waves, all dependent on a physical transmission medium
* &quot;gravitational radiation&quot;, in the form of gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime

Radiation is often categorized as either &quot;ionizing&quot; or &quot;non-ionizing&quot; depending on the energy of the radiated particles. Ionizing radiation carries more than 10 electron volts (eV), which is enough to ionize atoms and molecules and break chemical bonds. This is an important distinction due to the large difference in harmfulness to living organisms. A common source of ionizing radiation is radioactive materials that emit α, β, or γ radiation, consisting of helium nuclei, electrons or positrons, and photons, respectively. Other sources include X-rays from medical radiography examinations and muons, mesons, positrons, neutrons and other particles that constitute the secondary cosmic rays that are produced after primary cosmic rays interact with Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

Gamma rays, X-rays, and the higher energy range of ultraviolet light constitute the ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word &quot;ionize&quot; refers to the breaking of one or more electrons away from an atom, an action that requires the relatively high energies that these electromagnetic waves supply. Further down the spectrum, the non-ionizing lower energies of the lower ultraviolet spectrum cannot ionize atoms, but can disrupt the inter-atomic bonds that form molecules, thereby breaking down molecules rather than atoms; a good example of this is sunburn caused by long-wavelength solar ultraviolet. The waves of longer wavelength than UV in visible light, infrared, and microwave frequencies cannot break bonds but can cause vibrations in the bonds which are sensed as heat. Radio wavelengths and below generally are not regarded as harmful to biological systems. These are not sharp delineations of the energies; there is some overlap in the effects of specific frequencies.

The word &quot;radiation&quot; arises from the phenomenon of waves &quot;radiating&quot; (i.e., traveling outward in all directions) from a source. This aspect leads to a system of measurements and physical units that apply to all types of radiation. Because such radiation expands as it passes through space, and as its energy is conserved (in vacuum), the intensity of all types of radiation from a point source follows an inverse-square law in relation to the distance from its source. Like any ideal law, the inverse-square law approximates a measured radiation intensity to the extent that the source approximates a geometric point.

== Ionizing radiation ==


Radiation with sufficiently high energy can ionize atoms; that is to say it can knock electrons off atoms, creating ions. Ionization occurs when an electron is stripped (or &quot;knocked out&quot;) from an electron shell of the atom, which leaves the atom with a net positive charge. Because living cells and, more importantly, the DNA in those cells can be damaged by this ionization, exposure to ionizing radiation increases the risk of cancer. Thus &quot;ionizing radiation&quot; is somewhat artificially separated from particle radiation and electromagnetic radiation, simply due to its great potential for biological damage. While an individual cell is made of trillions of atoms, only a small fraction of those will be ionized at low to moderate radiation powers. The probability of ionizing radiation causing cancer is dependent upon the absorbed dose of the radiation and is a function of the damaging tendency of the type of radiation (equivalent dose) and the sensitivity of the irradiated organism or tissue (effective dose).

If the source of the ionizing radiation is a radioactive material or a nuclear process such as fission or fusion, there is particle radiation to consider. Particle radiation is subatomic particles accelerated to relativistic speeds by nuclear reactions. Because of their momenta, they are quite capable of knocking out electrons and ionizing materials, but since most have an electrical charge, they do not have the penetrating power of ionizing radiation. The exception is neutron particles; see below. There are several different kinds of these particles, but the majority are alpha particles, beta particles, neutrons, and protons. Roughly speaking, photons and particles with energies above about 10 electron volts (eV) are ionizing (some authorities use 33 eV, the ionization energy for water). Particle radiation from radioactive material or cosmic rays almost invariably carries enough energy to be ionizing.

Most ionizing radiation originates from radioactive materials and space (cosmic rays), and as such is naturally present in the environment, since most rocks and soil have small concentrations of radioactive materials. Since this radiation is invisible and not directly detectable by human senses, instruments such as Geiger counters are usually required to detect its presence. In some cases, it may lead to secondary emission of visible light upon its interaction with matter, as in the case of Cherenkov radiation and radio-luminescence.

Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research, and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure, and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood, and currently estimates are loosely determined by population-based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that &quot;The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values&quot;, &quot;Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections&quot; and &quot;in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided&quot;.

=== Ultraviolet radiation ===

Ultraviolet, of wavelengths from 10 nm to 200 nm, ionizes air molecules, causing it to be strongly absorbed by air and by ozone (O3) in particular. Ionizing UV therefore does not penetrate Earth&#x27;s atmosphere to a significant degree, and is sometimes referred to as vacuum ultraviolet. Although present in space, this part of the UV spectrum is not of biological importance, because it does not reach living organisms on Earth.

There is a zone of the atmosphere in which ozone absorbs some 98% of non-ionizing but dangerous UV-C and UV-B. This ozone layer starts at about and extends upward. Some of the ultraviolet spectrum that does reach the ground is non-ionizing, but is still biologically hazardous due to the ability of single photons of this energy to cause electronic excitation in biological molecules, and thus damage them by means of unwanted reactions. An example is the formation of pyrimidine dimers in DNA, which begins at wavelengths below 365 nm (3.4 eV), which is well below ionization energy. This property gives the ultraviolet spectrum some of the dangers of ionizing radiation in biological systems without actual ionization occurring. In contrast, visible light and longer-wavelength electromagnetic radiation, such as infrared, microwaves, and radio waves, consists of photons with too little energy to cause damaging molecular excitation, and thus this radiation is far less hazardous per unit of energy.

=== X-rays ===

X-rays are electromagnetic waves with a wavelength less than about 10−9 m (greater than and ). A smaller wavelength corresponds to a higher energy according to the equation &quot;E&quot; = &quot;h&quot;&quot;c&quot;/&quot;λ&quot;. (&quot;E&quot; is Energy; &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant; &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light; &quot;λ&quot; is wavelength.) When an X-ray photon collides with an atom, the atom may absorb the energy of the photon and boost an electron to a higher orbital level, or if the photon is extremely energetic, it may knock an electron from the atom altogether, causing the atom to ionize. Generally, larger atoms are more likely to absorb an X-ray photon since they have greater energy differences between orbital electrons. The soft tissue in the human body is composed of smaller atoms than the calcium atoms that make up bone, so there is a contrast in the absorption of X-rays. X-ray machines are specifically designed to take advantage of the absorption difference between bone and soft tissue, allowing physicians to examine structure in the human body.

X-rays are also totally absorbed by the thickness of the earth&#x27;s atmosphere, resulting in the prevention of the X-ray output of the sun, smaller in quantity than that of UV but nonetheless powerful, from reaching the surface.

=== Gamma radiation ===
Gamma (γ) radiation consists of photons with a wavelength less than (greater than 1019 Hz and 41.4 keV). Gamma radiation emission is a nuclear process that occurs to rid an unstable nucleus of excess energy after most nuclear reactions. Both alpha and beta particles have an electric charge and mass, and thus are quite likely to interact with other atoms in their path. Gamma radiation, however, is composed of photons, which have neither mass nor electric charge and, as a result, penetrates much further through matter than either alpha or beta radiation.

Gamma rays can be stopped by a sufficiently thick or dense layer of material, where the stopping power of the material per given area depends mostly (but not entirely) on the total mass along the path of the radiation, regardless of whether the material is of high or low density. However, as is the case with X-rays, materials with a high atomic number such as lead or depleted uranium add a modest (typically 20% to 30%) amount of stopping power over an equal mass of less dense and lower atomic weight materials (such as water or concrete). The atmosphere absorbs all gamma rays approaching Earth from space. Even air is capable of absorbing gamma rays, halving the energy of such waves by passing through, on the average, .

=== Alpha radiation ===
Alpha particles are helium-4 nuclei (two protons and two neutrons). They interact with matter strongly due to their charges and combined mass, and at their usual velocities only penetrate a few centimetres of air, or a few millimetres of low density material (such as the thin mica material which is specially placed in some Geiger counter tubes to allow alpha particles in). This means that alpha particles from ordinary alpha decay do not penetrate the outer layers of dead skin cells and cause no damage to the live tissues below. Some very high energy alpha particles compose about 10% of cosmic rays, and these are capable of penetrating the body and even thin metal plates. However, they are of danger only to astronauts, since they are deflected by the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and then stopped by its atmosphere.

Alpha radiation is dangerous when alpha-emitting radioisotopes are inhaled or ingested (breathed or swallowed). This brings the radioisotope close enough to sensitive live tissue for the alpha radiation to damage cells. Per unit of energy, alpha particles are at least 20 times more effective at cell-damage than gamma rays and X-rays. See relative biological effectiveness for a discussion of this. Examples of highly poisonous alpha-emitters are all isotopes of radium, radon, and polonium, due to the amount of decay that occur in these short half-life materials.

=== Beta radiation ===
Beta-minus (β−) radiation consists of an energetic electron. It is more penetrating than alpha radiation but less than gamma. Beta radiation from radioactive decay can be stopped with a few centimetres of plastic or a few millimetres of metal. It occurs when a neutron decays into a proton in a nucleus, releasing the beta particle and an antineutrino. Beta radiation from linac accelerators is far more energetic and penetrating than natural beta radiation. It is sometimes used therapeutically in radiotherapy to treat superficial tumors.

Beta-plus (β+) radiation is the emission of positrons, which are the antimatter form of electrons. When a positron slows to speeds similar to those of electrons in the material, the positron will annihilate an electron, releasing two gamma photons of 511 keV in the process. Those two gamma photons will be traveling in (approximately) opposite directions. The gamma radiation from positron annihilation consists of high energy photons, and is also ionizing.

=== Neutron radiation ===

Neutrons are categorized according to their speed/energy. Neutron radiation consists of free neutrons. These neutrons may be emitted during either spontaneous or induced nuclear fission. Neutrons are rare radiation particles; they are produced in large numbers only where chain reaction fission or fusion reactions are active; this happens for about 10 microseconds in a thermonuclear explosion, or continuously inside an operating nuclear reactor; production of the neutrons stops almost immediately in the reactor when it goes non-critical.

Neutrons can make other objects, or material, radioactive. This process, called neutron activation, is the primary method used to produce radioactive sources for use in medical, academic, and industrial applications. Even comparatively low speed thermal neutrons cause neutron activation (in fact, they cause it more efficiently). Neutrons do not ionize atoms in the same way that charged particles such as protons and electrons do (by the excitation of an electron), because neutrons have no charge. It is through their absorption by nuclei which then become unstable that they cause ionization. Hence, neutrons are said to be &quot;indirectly ionizing&quot;. Even neutrons without significant kinetic energy are indirectly ionizing, and are thus a significant radiation hazard. Not all materials are capable of neutron activation; in water, for example, the most common isotopes of both types atoms present (hydrogen and oxygen) capture neutrons and become heavier but remain stable forms of those atoms. Only the absorption of more than one neutron, a statistically rare occurrence, can activate a hydrogen atom, while oxygen requires two additional absorptions. Thus water is only very weakly capable of activation. The sodium in salt (as in sea water), on the other hand, need only absorb a single neutron to become Na-24, a very intense source of beta decay, with a half-life of 15 hours.

In addition, high-energy (high-speed) neutrons have the ability to directly ionize atoms. One mechanism by which high energy neutrons ionize atoms is to strike the nucleus of an atom and knock the atom out of a molecule, leaving one or more electrons behind as the chemical bond is broken. This leads to production of chemical free radicals. In addition, very high energy neutrons can cause ionizing radiation by &quot;neutron spallation&quot; or knockout, wherein neutrons cause emission of high-energy protons from atomic nuclei (especially hydrogen nuclei) on impact. The last process imparts most of the neutron&#x27;s energy to the proton, much like one billiard ball striking another. The charged protons and other products from such reactions are directly ionizing.

High-energy neutrons are very penetrating and can travel great distances in air (hundreds or even thousands of metres) and moderate distances (several metres) in common solids. They typically require hydrogen rich shielding, such as concrete or water, to block them within distances of less than 1 m. A common source of neutron radiation occurs inside a nuclear reactor, where a metres-thick water layer is used as effective shielding.

== Cosmic radiation ==

There are two sources of high energy particles entering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere from outer space: the sun and deep space. The sun continuously emits particles, primarily free protons, in the solar wind, and occasionally augments the flow hugely with coronal mass ejections (CME).

The particles from deep space (inter- and extra-galactic) are much less frequent, but of much higher energies. These particles are also mostly protons, with much of the remainder consisting of helions (alpha particles). A few completely ionized nuclei of heavier elements are present. The origin of these galactic cosmic rays is not yet well understood, but they seem to be remnants of supernovae and especially gamma-ray bursts (GRB), which feature magnetic fields capable of the huge accelerations measured from these particles. They may also be generated by quasars, which are galaxy-wide jet phenomena similar to GRBs but known for their much larger size, and which seem to be a violent part of the universe&#x27;s early history.

== Non-ionizing radiation ==

The kinetic energy of particles of non-ionizing radiation is too small to produce charged ions when passing through matter. For non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation (see types below), the associated particles (photons) have only sufficient energy to change the rotational, vibrational or electronic valence configurations of molecules and atoms. The effect of non-ionizing forms of radiation on living tissue has only recently been studied. Nevertheless, different biological effects are observed for different types of non-ionizing radiation.

Even &quot;non-ionizing&quot; radiation is capable of causing thermal-ionization if it deposits enough heat to raise temperatures to ionization energies. These reactions occur at far higher total energies than with ionization radiation, which requires only single particles to cause ionization. A familiar example of thermal ionization is the flame-ionization of a common fire, and the browning reactions in common food items induced by infrared radiation, during broiling-type cooking.

The electromagnetic spectrum is the range of all possible electromagnetic radiation frequencies. The electromagnetic spectrum (usually just spectrum) of an object is the characteristic distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by, or absorbed by, that particular object.

The non-ionizing portion of electromagnetic radiation consists of electromagnetic waves that (as individual quanta or particles, see photon) are not energetic enough to detach electrons from atoms or molecules and hence cause their ionization. These include radio waves, microwaves, infrared, and (sometimes) visible light. The lower frequencies of ultraviolet light may cause chemical changes and molecular damage similar to ionization, but is technically not ionizing. The highest frequencies of ultraviolet light, as well as all X-rays and gamma-rays are ionizing.

The occurrence of ionization depends on the energy of the individual particles or waves, and not on their number. An intense flood of particles or waves will not cause ionization if these particles or waves do not carry enough energy to be ionizing, unless they raise the temperature of a body to a point high enough to ionize small fractions of atoms or molecules by the process of thermal-ionization (this, however, requires relatively extreme radiation intensities).

=== Ultraviolet light ===

As noted above, the lower part of the spectrum of ultraviolet, called soft UV, from 3 eV to about 10 eV, is non-ionizing. However, the effects of non-ionizing ultraviolet on chemistry and the damage to biological systems exposed to it (including oxidation, mutation, and cancer) are such that even this part of ultraviolet is often compared with ionizing radiation.

=== Visible light ===
Light, or visible light, is a very narrow range of electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength that is visible to the human eye, or 380–750 nm which equates to a frequency range of 790 to 400 THz respectively. More broadly, physicists use the term &quot;light&quot; to mean electromagnetic radiation of all wavelengths, whether visible or not.

=== Infrared ===

Infrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 0.7 and 300 μm, which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 and 1 THz respectively. IR wavelengths are longer than that of visible light, but shorter than that of microwaves. Infrared may be detected at a distance from the radiating objects by &quot;feel&quot;. Infrared sensing snakes can detect and focus infrared by use of a pinhole lens in their heads, called &quot;pits&quot;. Bright sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1 kW/m2 at sea level. Of this energy, 53% is infrared radiation, 44% is visible light, and 3% is ultraviolet radiation.

=== Microwave ===
Microwaves are electromagnetic waves with wavelengths ranging from as short as 1 mm to as long as 1 m, which equates to a frequency range of 300 MHz to 300 GHz. This broad definition includes both UHF and EHF (millimetre waves), but various sources use different other limits. In all cases, microwaves include the entire super high frequency band (3 to 30 GHz, or 10 to 1 cm) at minimum, with RF engineering often putting the lower boundary at 1 GHz (30 cm), and the upper around 100 GHz (3 mm).

=== Radio waves ===
Radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum longer than infrared light. Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are made by lightning, or by certain astronomical objects. Artificially generated radio waves are used for fixed and mobile radio communication, broadcasting, radar and other navigation systems, satellite communication, computer networks and innumerable other applications. In addition, almost any wire carrying alternating current will radiate some of the energy away as radio waves; these are mostly termed interference. Different frequencies of radio waves have different propagation characteristics in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere; long waves may bend at the rate of the curvature of the Earth and may cover a part of the Earth very consistently, shorter waves travel around the world by multiple reflections off the ionosphere and the Earth. Much shorter wavelengths bend or reflect very little and travel along the line of sight.

=== Very low frequency ===
Very low frequency (VLF) refers to a frequency range of 30 Hz to 3 kHz which corresponds to wavelengths of respectively. Since there is not much bandwidth in this range of the radio spectrum, only the very simplest signals can be transmitted, such as for radio navigation. Also known as the myriametre band or myriametre wave as the wavelengths range from 100 km to 10 km (an obsolete metric unit equal to 10 km).

=== Extremely low frequency ===

Extremely low frequency (ELF) is radiation frequencies from 3 to 30 Hz (108 to 107 m respectively). In atmosphere science, an alternative definition is usually given, from 3 Hz to 3 kHz. In the related magnetosphere science, the lower frequency electromagnetic oscillations (pulsations occurring below ~3 Hz) are considered to lie in the ULF range, which is thus also defined differently from the ITU Radio Bands. A massive military ELF antenna in Michigan radiates very slow messages to otherwise unreachable receivers, such as submerged submarines.

=== Thermal radiation (heat) ===
Thermal radiation is a common synonym for infrared radiation emitted by objects at temperatures often encountered on Earth. Thermal radiation refers not only to the radiation itself, but also the process by which the surface of an object radiates its thermal energy in the form of black-body radiation. Infrared or red radiation from a common household radiator or electric heater is an example of thermal radiation, as is the heat emitted by an operating incandescent light bulb. Thermal radiation is generated when energy from the movement of charged particles within atoms is converted to electromagnetic radiation.

As noted above, even low-frequency thermal radiation may cause temperature-ionization whenever it deposits sufficient thermal energy to raise temperatures to a high enough level. Common examples of this are the ionization (plasma) seen in common flames, and the molecular changes caused by the &quot;browning&quot; during food-cooking, which is a chemical process that begins with a large component of ionization.

=== Black-body radiation ===

&quot;Black-body radiation&quot; is an idealized spectrum of radiation emitted by a body that is at a uniform temperature. The shape of the spectrum and the total amount of energy emitted by the body is a function of the absolute temperature of that body. The radiation emitted covers the entire electromagnetic spectrum and the intensity of the radiation (power/unit-area) at a given frequency is described by Planck&#x27;s law of radiation. For a given temperature of a black-body there is a particular frequency at which the radiation emitted is at its maximum intensity. That maximum radiation frequency moves toward higher frequencies as the temperature of the body increases. The frequency at which the black-body radiation is at maximum is given by Wien&#x27;s displacement law and is a function of the body&#x27;s absolute temperature. A black-body is one that emits at any temperature the maximum possible amount of radiation at any given wavelength. A black-body will also absorb the maximum possible incident radiation at any given wavelength. A black-body with a temperature at or below room temperature would thus appear absolutely black, as it would not reflect any incident light nor would it emit enough radiation at visible wavelengths for our eyes to detect. Theoretically, a black-body emits electromagnetic radiation over the entire spectrum from very low frequency radio waves to x-rays, creating a continuum of radiation.

The color of a radiating black-body tells the temperature of its radiating surface. It is responsible for the color of stars, which vary from infrared through red (), to yellow (), to white and to blue-white () as the peak radiance passes through those points in the visible spectrum. When the peak is below the visible spectrum the body is black, while when it is above the body is blue-white, since all the visible colors are represented from blue decreasing to red.

== Discovery ==
Electromagnetic radiation of wavelengths other than visible light were discovered in the early 19th century. The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to William Herschel, the astronomer. Herschel published his results in 1800 before the Royal Society of London. Herschel, like Ritter, used a prism to refract light from the Sun and detected the infrared (beyond the red part of the spectrum), through an increase in the temperature recorded by a thermometer.

In 1801, the German physicist Johann Wilhelm Ritter made the discovery of ultraviolet by noting that the rays from a prism darkened silver chloride preparations more quickly than violet light. Ritter&#x27;s experiments were an early precursor to what would become photography. Ritter noted that the UV rays were capable of causing chemical reactions.

The first radio waves detected were not from a natural source, but were produced deliberately and artificially by the German scientist Heinrich Hertz in 1887, using electrical circuits calculated to produce oscillations in the radio frequency range, following formulas suggested by the equations of James Clerk Maxwell.

Wilhelm Röntgen discovered and named X-rays. While experimenting with high voltages applied to an evacuated tube on 8 November 1895, he noticed a fluorescence on a nearby plate of coated glass. Within a month, he discovered the main properties of X-rays that we understand to this day.

In 1896, Henri Becquerel found that rays emanating from certain minerals penetrated black paper and caused fogging of an unexposed photographic plate. His doctoral student Marie Curie discovered that only certain chemical elements gave off these rays of energy. She named this behavior radioactivity.

Alpha rays (alpha particles) and beta rays (beta particles) were differentiated by Ernest Rutherford through simple experimentation in 1899. Rutherford used a generic pitchblende radioactive source and determined that the rays produced by the source had differing penetrations in materials. One type had short penetration (it was stopped by paper) and a positive charge, which Rutherford named &quot;alpha rays&quot;. The other was more penetrating (able to expose film through paper but not metal) and had a negative charge, and this type Rutherford named &quot;beta&quot;. This was the radiation that had been first detected by Becquerel from uranium salts. In 1900, the French scientist Paul Villard discovered a third neutrally charged and especially penetrating type of radiation from radium, and after he described it, Rutherford realized it must be yet a third type of radiation, which in 1903 Rutherford named gamma rays.

Henri Becquerel himself proved that beta rays are fast electrons, while Rutherford and Thomas Royds proved in 1909 that alpha particles are ionized helium. Rutherford and Edward Andrade proved in 1914 that gamma rays are like X-rays, but with shorter wavelengths.

Cosmic ray radiations striking the Earth from outer space were finally definitively recognized and proven to exist in 1912, as the scientist Victor Hess carried an electrometer to various altitudes in a free balloon flight. The nature of these radiations was only gradually understood in later years.

The Neutron and neutron radiation were discovered by James Chadwick in 1932. A number of other high energy particulate radiations such as positrons, muons, and pions were discovered by cloud chamber examination of cosmic ray reactions shortly thereafter, and others types of particle radiation were produced artificially in particle accelerators, through the last half of the twentieth century.

== Applications ==

=== Medicine ===
Radiation and radioactive substances are used for diagnosis, treatment, and research. X-rays, for example, pass through muscles and other soft tissue but are stopped by dense materials. This property of X-rays enables doctors to find broken bones and to locate cancers that might be growing in the body. Doctors also find certain diseases by injecting a radioactive substance and monitoring the radiation given off as the substance moves through the body. Radiation used for cancer treatment is called ionizing radiation because it forms ions in the cells of the tissues it passes through as it dislodges electrons from atoms. This can kill cells or change genes so the cells cannot grow. Other forms of radiation such as radio waves, microwaves, and light waves are called non-ionizing. They do not have as much energy so they are not able to ionize cells.

=== Communication ===
All modern communication systems use forms of electromagnetic radiation. Variations in the intensity of the radiation represent changes in the sound, pictures, or other information being transmitted. For example, a human voice can be sent as a radio wave or microwave by making the wave vary to corresponding variations in the voice. Musicians have also experimented with gamma rays sonification, or using nuclear radiation, to produce sound and music.

=== Science ===
Researchers use radioactive atoms to determine the age of materials that were once part of a living organism. The age of such materials can be estimated by measuring the amount of radioactive carbon they contain in a process called radiocarbon dating. Similarly, using other radioactive elements, the age of rocks and other geological features (even some man-made objects) can be determined; this is called Radiometric dating. Environmental scientists use radioactive atoms, known as tracer atoms, to identify the pathways taken by pollutants through the environment.

Radiation is used to determine the composition of materials in a process called neutron activation analysis. In this process, scientists bombard a sample of a substance with particles called neutrons. Some of the atoms in the sample absorb neutrons and become radioactive. The scientists can identify the elements in the sample by studying the emitted radiation.

== Possible damage to health and environment from certain types of radiation ==
Radiation is not always dangerous, and not all types of radiation are equally dangerous, contrary to several common medical myths. For example, although bananas contain naturally occurring radioactive isotopes, particularly potassium-40 (40K), which emit ionizing radiation when undergoing radioactive decay, the levels of such radiation are far too low to induce radiation poisoning, and bananas are not a radiation hazard. It would not be physically possible to eat enough bananas to cause radiation poisoning, as the radiation dose from bananas is non-cumulative. Radiation is ubiquitous on Earth, and humans are adapted to survive at the normal low-to-moderate levels of radiation found on Earth&#x27;s surface. The relationship between dose and toxicity is often non-linear, and many substances that are toxic at very high doses actually have neutral or positive health effects, or are biologically essential, at moderate or low doses. There is some evidence to suggest that this is true for ionizing radiation: normal levels of ionizing radiation may serve to stimulate and regulate the activity of DNA repair mechanisms. High enough levels of any kind of radiation will eventually become lethal, however.

Ionizing radiation in certain conditions can damage living organisms, causing cancer or genetic damage.

Non-ionizing radiation in certain conditions also can cause damage to living organisms, such as burns. In 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) of the World Health Organization (WHO) released a statement adding radio frequency electromagnetic fields (including microwave and millimetre waves) to their list of things which are possibly carcinogenic to humans.

RWTH Aachen University&#x27;s EMF-Portal web site presents one of the biggest database about the effects of electromagnetic radiation. As of 12 July 2019 it has 28,547 publications and 6,369 summaries of individual scientific studies on the effects of electromagnetic fields.

== Environmental radioactivity ==

On Earth there are different sources of radiation, natural as well as artificial. Natural radiation can come from the Sun, Earth itself, or from cosmic radiation.

<text>Rodolphus Agricola (; August 28, 1443, or February 17, 1444 – October 27, 1485) was a Dutch humanist of the Northern Low Countries, famous for his knowledge of Latin and Greek. He was an educator, musician, builder of church organs, a poet in Latin and the vernacular, a diplomat, a boxer and a Hebrew scholar towards the end of his life. Today, he is best known as the author of &quot;De inventione dialectica&quot;, the father of Northern European humanism and a zealous anti-scholastic in the late fifteenth century.

== Biography ==

Agricola was born in Baflo in the Dutch province of Groningen as the illegitimate son of the cleric and future abbot Hendrik Vries and Zycka Huesman, a rich farmer&#x27;s daughter. He was originally named &quot;Roelof Huesman&quot;, or &quot;Huisman&quot;, his mother&#x27;s surname. The Latin adjective &quot;Phrisius&quot; identifies him as a Frisian.

Educated first by the school of St. Maarten in Groningen, Agricola matriculated at the University of Erfurt with his father&#x27;s assistance and received a BA in 1458. He then studied at University of Louvain, receiving an MA in 1465; he was renowned for the purity of his Latin and skill in disputation. He concentrated his studies on Cicero and Quintilian, but also added French and Greek to his ever-growing list of languages during his university years. At the end of his life, he would learn Hebrew to be able to read the Old Testament, especially the Psalms, unadulterated by translation.

In the 1460s Agricola travelled to Italy, where he became associated with humanist masters and statesmen. From circa 1468 until 1475, he studied civil law at the University of Pavia and later went to Ferrara (1475–1479). There, he became the protégé of Prince d&#x27;Este of Ferrara, and was a pupil of Theodor Gaza and attended lectures by Battista Guarino. He devoted himself to the study of classical texts and gained fame for the elegance of his Latin style and his knowledge of philosophy. While in Ferrara, Agricola gained formal employment as the organist to the opulent ducal chapel. He held that post until 1479, after which he returned to the North, becoming secretary to the city of Groningen. Here, at the Cistercian Abbey of St Bernard at Aduard, near Groningen, and at &#x27;s-Heerenbergh near Emmerich in the south-east, he was at the center of a group of scholars and humanists, with whom he kept up a lively exchange of letters. His correspondents included the musician and choirmaster of Antwerp Jacobus Barbirianus (Barbireau), rector of the Latin School at Deventer Alexander Hegius von Heek and Johannes Reuchlin, the humanist scholar and later student of Hebrew.

In 1470, he taught a deaf child how to communicate orally and in writing; his work, &quot;De inventione dialectica,&quot; documents this pioneering educational effort.

Once in Germany again, he spent time in Dillingen, where he continued to correspond with humanist friends and colleagues throughout Europe. In correspondence, he primarily advocated for his project to promote the study of classical learning and the &quot;Studia humanitatis&quot;. Agricola remained an independent scholar, unattached to a university or religious establishment. This independence became a hallmark of humanist scholars. In 1479, Agricola completed his &quot;De inventione dialectica&quot; (&quot;On Dialectical Invention&quot;) in Dillingen, which argued for the precise application of &quot;loci&quot; in scholarly argumentation.

From 1480 to 1484 he held the post of secretary of the city of Groningen.

In 1481, Agricola spent six months in Brussels at the court of Archduke Maximilian (later Maximilian I, the Holy Roman Emperor). Friends attempted to dissuade him from accepting the archduke&#x27;s patronage as they feared that the archduke&#x27;s influence would undermine his philosophical ideals. He also declined the offer to become the head of a Latin school at Antwerp.

In 1484, Agricola moved to Heidelberg by invitation of Johann von Dalberg, the Bishop of Worms. The two men had met in Pavia, and they became close friends in Heidelberg. The bishop was a generous benefactor of learning. At this time Agricola began studying Hebrew, and he is said to have published an original translation of the Psalms.

In 1485, Dalberg was sent as an ambassador to Pope Innocent VIII in Rome, with Agricola accompanying him; the latter was struck gravely ill on their journey. He died shortly after their return to Heidelberg and Ermolao Barbaro composed an epitaph for him.

== Legacy ==

&quot;De inventione dialectica&quot; was influential in creating a place for logic in rhetorical studies and was of significance in the education of early humanists. It was a critical and systematic treatment of ideas and concepts related to dialectics.

The significance of &quot;De inventione dialectica&quot; for the history of argumentation is that it assimilated the art of dialectic to that of rhetoric. Argumentation focused not on truth but on what might be said with reason. Accordingly, Agricola focused on the &quot;Topics&quot; rather than the &quot;Analytics&quot; of Aristotle and on Cicero, but also on the writings of historians, poets, and orators. Thus, for Agricola, dialectic was an open field; the art of finding &quot;whatever can be said with any degree of probability on any subject.&quot; (Hamilton, David. &quot;From Dialectic to Didactic&quot;).

Agricola was also important to the deaf community, since he believed that people who are born deaf can express themselves by putting their thoughts into writing. His statement that deaf people can be taught a language is one of the earliest positive statements about deafness on record (Gannon, 1981).

Agricola&#x27;s &quot;De formando studio&quot;—his long letter on a private educational program—was printed as a small booklet and influenced pedagogy of the early sixteenth century.

Agricola was also important for his personal influence over others. Erasmus admired Agricola, eulogizing him in &quot;Adagia&quot; and calling him &quot;the first to bring a breath of better literature from Italy.&quot; Erasmus claimed him as a father/teacher figure and may have met him through his own schoolmaster Alexander Hegius (most probably one of Agricola&#x27;s students) at Hegius&#x27;s School in Deventer. In addition to Hegius, Agricola&#x27;s students include Conrad Celtis (in Heidelberg).

Erasmus made it his personal mission to ensure that several of Agricola&#x27;s major works were printed posthumously. Agricola&#x27;s literary executor was Adolphus Occo, a physician of Augsburg. By about 1530 disciples and followers had gathered the manuscripts left by Agricola, and these were edited by Alardus of Amsterdam.

<text>Ruth Gordon Jones (October 30, 1896 – August 28, 1985) was an American actress, playwright and screenwriter. She began her career performing on Broadway at age 19. Known for her nasal voice and distinctive personality, Gordon gained international recognition and critical acclaim for film roles that continued into her 70s and 80s. Her later work included performances in &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968), &quot;What Ever Happened to Aunt Alice?&quot; (1969), &quot;Where&#x27;s Poppa?&quot; (1970), &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; (1971), &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot; (1978), &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot; (1980), and &quot;My Bodyguard&quot; (1980).

In addition to her acting career, Gordon wrote numerous plays, film scripts, and books, most notably co-writing the screenplay for the 1949 film &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot;. Gordon won an Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy, and two Golden Globe Awards for her acting, as well as three Academy Award nominations for her writing.

==Early life and education==
Ruth Gordon Jones was born in Quincy, Massachusetts, at 41 Winthrop Avenue. She later resided at 41 Marion Street (1901–1903) and 14 Elmwood Avenue (1903–1914). All three homes are in the Wollaston section of town.

She was the child of Annie Tapley (née Ziegler) and Clinton Jones. Her only sibling was an older half-sister Claire, from her father&#x27;s first marriage. She was baptized an Episcopalian. Her first appearance in the public eye came as an infant when her photograph was used in advertising for her father&#x27;s employer, Mellin&#x27;s Food for Infants and Invalids. Before graduating from Quincy High School, she wrote to several of her favorite actresses requesting autographed pictures. A personal reply from Hazel Dawn (whom she had seen in a stage production of &quot;The Pink Lady&quot;) inspired her to go into acting. Although her father was skeptical of her chances of success in a difficult profession, he took his daughter to New York in 1914, where he enrolled her in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.

==Career==
=== Silent films ===
In 1915, Gordon appeared as an extra in silent films that were shot in Fort Lee, New Jersey, including as a dancer in &quot;The Whirl of Life&quot;, a film based on the lives of Vernon and Irene Castle. The same year, she made her Broadway debut in a revival of &quot;Peter Pan, or the Boy Who Wouldn&#x27;t Grow Up&quot; in the role of Nibs (one of the Lost Boys), appearing onstage with Maude Adams and earning a favorable mention from powerful critic Alexander Woollcott. He described her favorably as &quot;ever so gay&quot;, and he became her friend and mentor.

In 1918, Gordon played opposite actor Gregory Kelly in the Broadway adaptation of Booth Tarkington&#x27;s &quot;Seventeen&quot;. The pair continued to perform together in North American tours of Frank Craven&#x27;s &quot;The First Year&quot; and Tarkington&#x27;s &quot;Clarence&quot; and &quot;Tweedles&quot;. Then in 1921, Gordon and Kelly were wed.

In December 1920, Gordon checked into a Chicago hospital to have her legs broken and straightened to treat her lifelong bow-leggedness. After a three-month recovery, she moved to Indianapolis, where they started a repertory company.

Kelly died of heart disease in 1927 at the age of 36. Gordon at the time had been enjoying a comeback, appearing on Broadway as Bobby in Maxwell Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Children&quot;, performing in a serious role after being typecast for years as a &quot;beautiful, but dumb&quot; character.

In 1929, Gordon was starring in the hit play &quot;Serena Blandish&quot; when she became pregnant by the show&#x27;s producer, Jed Harris. Their son, Jones Harris, was born in Paris that year and Gordon brought him back to New York. Although they never married, Gordon and Harris provided their son with a normal upbringing, and his parentage became public knowledge as social conventions changed. In 1932, the family was living discreetly in a small, elegant New York City brownstone.
 Their son later married the actress and heiress Heidi Vanderbilt.

=== 1930s ===
Gordon continued to act on the stage throughout the 1930s, including notable runs as Mattie in &quot;Ethan Frome&quot;, Margery Pinchwife in William Wycherley&#x27;s Restoration comedy &quot;The Country Wife&quot; at London&#x27;s Old Vic and on Broadway, and Nora Helmer in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; at Central City, Colorado, and on Broadway.

=== 1940s ===
Gordon was signed to a Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film contract for a brief period in the early 1930s, but did not make a movie for the company until her supporting role in Greta Garbo&#x27;s final film &quot;Two-Faced Woman&quot; (1941). Gordon had better luck at other studios in Hollywood, appearing in supporting roles in a string of films, including &quot;Abe Lincoln in Illinois&quot; (as Mary Todd Lincoln), &quot;Dr. Ehrlich&#x27;s Magic Bullet&quot; (as Mrs. Ehrlich) and &quot;Action in the North Atlantic&quot;, in the early 1940s. Gordon&#x27;s Broadway acting appearances in the 1940s included Iris in Paul Vincent Carroll&#x27;s &quot;The Strings, My Lord, Are False&quot;, Natasha in Katharine Cornell and Guthrie McClintic&#x27;s revival of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot;, and leading roles in her plays &quot;Over Twenty-One&quot; and &quot;The Leading Lady&quot;.

Gordon married her second husband, writer Garson Kanin, in 1942. Gordon and Kanin collaborated on the screenplays for the Katharine Hepburn – Spencer Tracy films &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot; (1949) and &quot;Pat and Mike&quot; (1952). Both films were directed by George Cukor. They were close friends of Hepburn and Tracy, and they incorporated elements of the actors&#x27; personalities in the films. Gordon and Kanin received Academy Award nominations for both of those screenplays as well as for &quot;A Double Life&quot; (1947), also directed by Cukor.

=== 1950s ===
&quot;The Actress&quot; (1953) was Gordon&#x27;s film adaptation of her autobiographical play &quot;Years Ago&quot;, filmed by MGM with Jean Simmons portraying the girl from Quincy, Massachusetts, who convinced her sea captain father to let her go to New York to become an actress. Gordon wrote three volumes of memoirs in the 1970s: &quot;My Side&quot;, &quot;Myself Among Others&quot;, and &quot;An Open Book&quot;.

Gordon continued her stage-acting career in the 1950s, and she was nominated for a 1956 Tony for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play for her portrayal of Dolly Levi in Thornton Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Matchmaker&quot;, a role she played in London, Edinburgh, and Berlin.

=== 1960s ===
In 1966, Gordon was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Inside Daisy Clover&quot; opposite Natalie Wood. It was her first nomination for acting. In 1969, she won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, a film adaptation of Ira Levin&#x27;s bestselling horror novel about a satanic cult residing in an Upper West Side apartment building in Manhattan. In accepting the award onstage at the 41st Academy Awards, Gordon thanked the academy by saying &quot;I can&#x27;t tell you how encouraging a thing like this is ...&quot; (rousing laughter from the audience). At the time she had been in the business for 50 years and was 72 years old. &quot;And thank all of you who voted for me, and to everyone who didn&#x27;t: please, excuse me&quot;, she added, prompting more laughter and applause.

Gordon won another Golden Globe for &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, and she was nominated again in 1971 for her role as Maude in &quot;Harold and Maude&quot; (with Bud Cort as her love interest).

=== Later career ===
She appeared in 22 more films and many television appearances through her 70s and 80s, including successful sitcoms such as &quot;Rhoda&quot; (as the mother of the unseen doorman Carlton, which earned her an Emmy nomination) and &quot;Newhart&quot;. She portrayed a murderous author on the 1977 episode &quot;Columbo: Try and Catch Me&quot;. She made countless talk-show appearances, in addition to hosting &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1977.

Gordon won an Emmy Award for an appearance on the sitcom &quot;Taxi&quot;, for a 1979 episode titled &quot;Sugar Mama&quot;, in which her character tries to solicit the services of a taxi driver, played by series star Judd Hirsch, as a male escort.

Her last Broadway appearance was as Mrs. Warren in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot;, produced by Joseph Papp at the Vivian Beaumont Theater in 1976. In the summer of 1976, Gordon starred in the leading role of her own play, &quot;Ho! Ho! Ho!&quot; at the Cape Playhouse in Dennis, Massachusetts. She had a minor role as Ma Boggs, the mother of Orville Boggs (Geoffrey Lewis), in the Clint Eastwood films &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot; and &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot;.

In 1983, Gordon was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award for outstanding women who, through their endurance and the excellence of their work, have helped to expand the role of women within the entertainment industry.

&quot;Harold and Maude&quot;, &quot;Adam&#x27;s Rib&quot;, and &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; have been selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the United States Library of Congress.

==Death and legacy==
On August 28, 1985, Gordon died at her summer home in Edgartown, Massachusetts, following a stroke at age 88. Her husband for 43 years, Garson Kanin, was at her side and said that even her last day of life was typically full, with walks, talks, errands, and a morning of work on a new play. She had made her last public appearance two weeks before at a benefit showing of the film &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;, and had recently finished acting in four films.

In August 1979, a small movie theater in Westboro, Massachusetts, was named the Ruth Gordon Flick. She attended the opening ceremony, standing on a bench in the lobby so she could be seen. The theater no longer exists. In November 1984, the outdoor amphitheater in Merrymount Park in Quincy, Massachusetts, was named Ruth Gordon Amphitheater in her honor.

<text>Richard Dawkins (born 26 March 1941) is a British evolutionary biologist, zoologist, science communicator, and author. He is an emeritus fellow of New College, Oxford, and was Professor for Public Understanding of Science in the University of Oxford from 1995 to 2008. His book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; (1976) popularised the gene-centred view of evolution and coined the word &quot;meme&quot;. Dawkins has won several academic and writing awards.

Dawkins is well known for his criticism of creationism and intelligent design as well as for being a vocal atheist. Dawkins wrote &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot; in 1986, arguing against the watchmaker analogy, an argument for the existence of a supernatural creator based upon the complexity of living organisms. Instead, he describes evolutionary processes as analogous to a &quot;blind&quot; watchmaker, in that reproduction, mutation, and selection are unguided by any sentient designer. In 2006, Dawkins published &quot;The God Delusion&quot;, writing that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion. He founded the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science in 2006. Dawkins has published two volumes of memoirs, &quot;An Appetite for Wonder&quot; (2013) and &quot;Brief Candle in the Dark&quot; (2015).

== Background ==

=== Early life ===
Dawkins was born Clinton Richard Dawkins on 26 March 1941 in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya during British colonial rule. He later dropped &quot;Clinton&quot; from his name by deed poll because of confusion in the United States over using his middle name as his first name. He is the son of Jean Mary Vyvyan (&quot;née&quot; Ladner; 1916–2019) and Clinton John Dawkins (1915–2010), an agricultural civil servant in the British Colonial Service in Nyasaland (present-day Malawi), of an Oxfordshire landed gentry family. His father was called up into the King&#x27;s African Rifles during the Second World War and returned to England in 1949, when Dawkins was eight. His father had inherited a country estate, Over Norton Park in Oxfordshire, which he farmed commercially. Dawkins lives in Oxford, England. He has a younger sister, Sarah.

His parents were interested in natural sciences, and they answered Dawkins&#x27;s questions in scientific terms. Dawkins describes his childhood as &quot;a normal Anglican upbringing&quot;. He embraced Christianity until halfway through his teenage years, at which point he concluded that the theory of evolution alone was a better explanation for life&#x27;s complexity, and ceased believing in a god. He states: &quot;The main residual reason why I was religious was from being so impressed with the complexity of life and feeling that it had to have a designer, and I think it was when I realised that Darwinism was a far superior explanation that pulled the rug out from under the argument of design. And that left me with nothing&quot;. This understanding of atheism, combined with his western cultural background, influences Dawkins as he describes himself in several interviews as a &quot;cultural Christian&quot; and a &quot;cultural Anglican&quot; in 2007 and 2013 and again in 2024. Dawkins explained, however, that this statement about his culture &quot;means absolutely nothing as far as religious belief is concerned.&quot;

=== Education ===

On his arrival in England from Nyasaland in 1949, at the age of eight, Dawkins joined Chafyn Grove School, in Wiltshire, where he says he was molested by a teacher. From 1954 to 1959, he attended Oundle School in Northamptonshire, an English public school with a Church of England ethos, where he was in Laundimer House. While at Oundle, Dawkins read Bertrand Russell&#x27;s &quot;Why I Am Not a Christian&quot; for the first time. He studied zoology at Balliol College, Oxford (the same college his father attended), graduating in 1962; while there, he was tutored by Nobel Prize-winning ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen. He graduated with a second-class degree.

Dawkins continued as a research student under Tinbergen&#x27;s supervision, receiving his Doctor of Philosophy degree by 1966, and remained a research assistant for another year. Tinbergen was a pioneer in the study of animal behaviour, particularly in the areas of instinct, learning, and choice; Dawkins&#x27;s research in this period concerned models of animal decision-making.

=== Teaching ===

From 1967 to 1969, Dawkins was an assistant professor of zoology at the University of California, Berkeley. During this period, the students and faculty at UC Berkeley were largely opposed to the ongoing Vietnam War, and Dawkins became involved in the anti-war demonstrations and activities. He returned to the University of Oxford in 1970 as a lecturer. In 1990, he became a reader in zoology. In 1995, he was appointed Simonyi Professor for the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford, a position that had been endowed by Charles Simonyi with the express intention that the holder &quot;be expected to make important contributions to the public understanding of some scientific field&quot;, and that its first holder should be Richard Dawkins. He held that professorship from 1995 until 2008.

Since 1970, he has been a fellow of New College, Oxford, and he is now an emeritus fellow. He has delivered many lectures, including the Henry Sidgwick Memorial Lecture (1989), the first Erasmus Darwin Memorial Lecture (1990), the Michael Faraday Lecture (1991), the T. H. Huxley Memorial Lecture (1992), the Irvine Memorial Lecture (1997), the Sheldon Doyle Lecture (1999), the Tinbergen Lecture (2004), and the Tanner Lectures (2003). In 1991, he gave the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures for Children on &quot;Growing Up in the Universe&quot;. He also has edited several journals and has acted as an editorial advisor to the &quot;Encarta Encyclopedia&quot; and the &quot;Encyclopedia of Evolution&quot;. He is listed as a senior editor and a columnist of the Council for Secular Humanism&#x27;s &quot;Free Inquiry&quot; magazine and has been a member of the editorial board of &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine since its foundation.

Dawkins has sat on judging panels for awards such as the Royal Society&#x27;s Faraday Award and the British Academy Television Awards, and has been president of the Biological Sciences section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2004, Balliol College, Oxford, instituted the Dawkins Prize, awarded for &quot;outstanding research into the ecology and behaviour of animals whose welfare and survival may be endangered by human activities&quot;. In September 2008, he retired from his professorship, announcing plans to &quot;write a book aimed at youngsters in which he will warn them against believing in &#x27;anti-scientific&#x27; fairytales&quot;. In 2011, Dawkins joined the professoriate of the New College of the Humanities, a private university in London established by A. C. Grayling, which opened in September 2012.

Dawkins announced his final speaking tour would take place in the autumn of 2024.

===Evolutionary biology===

Dawkins is best known for his popularisation of the gene as the principal unit of selection in evolution; this view is most clearly set out in two of his books:
* &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; (1976), in which he notes that &quot;all life evolves by the differential survival of replicating entities&quot;.
* &quot;The Extended Phenotype&quot; (1982), in which he describes natural selection as &quot;the process whereby replicators out-propagate each other&quot;. He introduces to a wider audience the influential concept he presented in 1977, that the phenotypic effects of a gene are not necessarily limited to an organism&#x27;s body, but can stretch far into the environment, including the bodies of other organisms. Dawkins regarded the extended phenotype as his single most important contribution to evolutionary biology and he considered niche construction to be a special case of extended phenotype. The concept of extended phenotype helps explain evolution, but it does not help predict specific outcomes.

Dawkins has consistently been sceptical about non-adaptive processes in evolution (such as spandrels, described by Gould and Lewontin) and about selection at levels &quot;above&quot; that of the gene. He is particularly sceptical about the practical possibility or importance of group selection as a basis for understanding altruism.

Altruism appears at first to be an evolutionary paradox, since helping others costs precious resources and decreases one&#x27;s own chances for survival, or &quot;fitness&quot;. Previously, many had interpreted altruism as an aspect of group selection, suggesting that individuals are doing what is best for the survival of the population or species as a whole. British evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton used gene-frequency analysis in his inclusive fitness theory to show how hereditary altruistic traits can evolve if there is sufficient genetic similarity between actors and recipients of such altruism, including close relatives. Hamilton&#x27;s inclusive fitness has since been successfully applied to a wide range of organisms, including humans. Similarly, Robert Trivers, thinking in terms of the gene-centred model, developed the theory of reciprocal altruism, whereby one organism provides a benefit to another in the expectation of future reciprocation. Dawkins popularised these ideas in &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, and developed them in his own work.

In June 2012, Dawkins was highly critical of fellow biologist E. O. Wilson&#x27;s 2012 book &quot;The Social Conquest of Earth&quot; as misunderstanding Hamilton&#x27;s theory of kin selection. Dawkins has also been strongly critical of the Gaia hypothesis of the independent scientist James Lovelock.

Critics of Dawkins&#x27;s biological approach suggest that taking the gene as the unit of &quot;selection&quot; (a single event in which an individual either succeeds or fails to reproduce) is misleading. The gene could be better described, they say, as a unit of &quot;evolution&quot; (the long-term changes in allele frequencies in a population). In &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, Dawkins explains that he is using George C. Williams&#x27;s definition of the gene as &quot;that which segregates and recombines with appreciable frequency&quot;. Another common objection is that a gene cannot survive alone, but must cooperate with other genes to build an individual, and therefore a gene cannot be an independent &quot;unit&quot;. In &quot;The Extended Phenotype&quot;, Dawkins suggests that from an individual gene&#x27;s viewpoint, all other genes are part of the environment to which it is adapted.

Advocates for higher levels of selection (such as Richard Lewontin, David Sloan Wilson, and Elliott Sober) suggest that there are many phenomena (including altruism) that gene-based selection cannot satisfactorily explain. The philosopher Mary Midgley, with whom Dawkins clashed in print concerning &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, has criticised gene selection, memetics, and sociobiology as being excessively reductionist; she has suggested that the popularity of Dawkins&#x27;s work is due to factors in the Zeitgeist such as the increased individualism of the Thatcher/Reagan decades. Besides, other, more recent views and analysis on his popular science works also exist.

In a set of controversies over the mechanisms and interpretation of evolution (what has been called &#x27;The Darwin Wars&#x27;), one faction is often named after Dawkins, while the other faction is named after the American palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould, reflecting the pre-eminence of each as a populariser of the pertinent ideas. In particular, Dawkins and Gould have been prominent commentators in the controversy over sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, with Dawkins generally approving and Gould generally being critical. A typical example of Dawkins&#x27;s position is his scathing review of &quot;Not in Our Genes&quot; by Steven Rose, Leon J. Kamin, and Richard C. Lewontin. Two other thinkers who are often considered to be allied with Dawkins on the subject are Steven Pinker and Daniel Dennett; Dennett has promoted a gene-centred view of evolution and defended reductionism in biology. Despite their academic disagreements, Dawkins and Gould did not have a hostile personal relationship, and Dawkins dedicated a large portion of his 2003 book &quot;A Devil&#x27;s Chaplain&quot; posthumously to Gould, who had died the previous year.

When asked if Darwinism influences his everyday apprehension of life, Dawkins says, &quot;In one way it does. My eyes are constantly wide open to the extraordinary fact of existence. Not just human existence but the existence of life and how this breathtakingly powerful process, which is natural selection, has managed to take the very simple facts of physics and chemistry and build them up to redwood trees and humans. That&#x27;s never far from my thoughts, that sense of amazement. On the other hand, I certainly don&#x27;t allow Darwinism to influence my feelings about human social life&quot;, implying that he feels that individual human beings can opt out of the survival machine of Darwinism since they are freed by the consciousness of self.

=== &quot;Meme&quot; as behavioural concept ===

In his book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, Dawkins coined the word &quot;meme&quot; (the behavioural equivalent of a gene) as a way to encourage readers to think about how Darwinian principles might be extended beyond the realm of genes. It was intended as an extension of his &quot;replicators&quot; argument, but it took on a life of its own in the hands of other authors, such as Daniel Dennett and Susan Blackmore. These popularisations then led to the emergence of memetics, a field from which Dawkins has distanced himself.

Dawkins&#x27;s &quot;meme&quot; refers to any cultural entity that an observer might consider a replicator of a certain idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that is analogous to the theory of biological evolution based on genes.

Although Dawkins invented the term &quot;meme&quot;, he has not said that the idea was entirely novel, and there have been other expressions for similar ideas in the past. For instance, John Laurent has suggested that the term may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist Richard Semon. Semon regarded &quot;mneme&quot; as the collective set of neural memory traces (conscious or subconscious) that were inherited, although such view would be considered as Lamarckian by modern biologists. Laurent also found the use of the term &quot;mneme&quot; in Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;The Life of the White Ant&quot; (1926), and Maeterlinck himself stated that he obtained the phrase from Semon&#x27;s work. In his own work, Maeterlinck tried to explain memory in termites and ants by stating that neural memory traces were added &quot;upon the individual mneme&quot;. Nonetheless, James Gleick describes Dawkins&#x27;s concept of the meme as &quot;his most famous memorable invention, far more influential than his selfish genes or his later proselytising against religiosity&quot;.

=== Foundation ===
In 2006, Dawkins founded the &quot;Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science&quot; (&quot;RDFRS&quot;), a non-profit organisation. RDFRS financed research on the psychology of belief and religion, financed scientific education programs and materials, and publicised and supported charitable organisations that are secular in nature. In January 2016, it was announced that the foundation was merging with the Center for Inquiry, with Dawkins becoming a member of the new organization&#x27;s board of directors.

===Criticism of religion===
Dawkins was confirmed into the Church of England at the age of 13, but began to grow sceptical of the beliefs. He said that his understanding of science and evolutionary processes led him to question how adults in positions of leadership in a civilised world could still be so uneducated in biology, and is puzzled by how belief in God could remain among individuals who are sophisticated in science. Dawkins says that some physicists use &#x27;God&#x27; as a metaphor for the general awe-inspiring mysteries of the universe, which he says causes confusion and misunderstanding among people who incorrectly think they are talking about a mystical being who forgives sins, transubstantiates wine, or makes people live after they die.

Dawkins disagrees with Stephen Jay Gould&#x27;s principle of nonoverlapping magisteria (NOMA) and suggests that the existence of God should be treated as a scientific hypothesis like any other. Dawkins became a prominent critic of religion and has stated his opposition to religion as twofold: religion is both a source of conflict and a justification for belief without evidence. He considers faith—belief that is not based on evidence—as &quot;one of the world&#x27;s great evils&quot;.

On his spectrum of theistic probability, which ranges from 1 (100% certainty that a God or gods exist) to 7 (100% certainty that a God or gods do not exist), Dawkins has said he is a 6.9, which represents a &quot;de facto atheist&quot; who thinks &quot;I cannot know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there&quot;. When asked about his slight uncertainty, Dawkins quips, &quot;I am agnostic to the extent that I am agnostic about fairies at the bottom of the garden&quot;. In May 2014, at the Hay Festival in Wales, Dawkins explained that while he does not believe in the supernatural elements of the Christian faith, he still has nostalgia for the ceremonial side of religion. In addition to beliefs in deities, Dawkins has criticised religious beliefs as irrational, such as that Jesus turned water into wine, that an embryo starts as a blob, that magic underwear will protect you, that Jesus was resurrected, that semen comes from the spine, that Jesus walked on water, that the sun sets in a marsh, that the Garden of Eden existed in Adam-ondi-Ahman, Missouri, that Jesus&#x27; mother was a virgin, that Muhammad split the Moon, and that Lazarus was raised from the dead.

Dawkins has risen to prominence in public debates concerning science and religion since the publication of his most popular book, &quot;The God Delusion&quot;, in 2006, which became an international bestseller. As of 2015, more than three million copies have been sold, and the book has been translated into more than 30 languages. Its success has been seen by many as indicative of a change in the contemporary cultural zeitgeist and has also been identified with the rise of New Atheism. In the book, Dawkins contends that a supernatural creator almost certainly does not exist and that religious faith is a delusion—&quot;a fixed false belief&quot;. In his February 2002 TED talk entitled &quot;Militant atheism&quot;, Dawkins urged all atheists to openly state their position and to fight the incursion of the church into politics and science. On 30 September 2007, Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Daniel Dennett met at Hitchens&#x27;s residence for a private, unmoderated discussion that lasted two hours. The event was videotaped and entitled &quot;The Four Horsemen&quot;.

Dawkins sees education and consciousness-raising as the primary tools in opposing what he considers to be religious dogma and indoctrination. These tools include the fight against certain stereotypes, and he has adopted the term &quot;bright&quot; as a way of associating positive public connotations with those who possess a naturalistic worldview. He has given support to the idea of a free-thinking school, which would not &quot;indoctrinate children&quot; but would instead teach children to ask for evidence and be skeptical, critical, and open-minded. Such a school, says Dawkins, should &quot;teach comparative religion, and teach it properly without any bias towards particular religions, and including historically important but dead religions, such as those of ancient Greece and the Norse gods, if only because these, like the Abrahamic scriptures, are important for understanding English literature and European history&quot;. Inspired by the consciousness-raising successes of feminists in arousing widespread embarrassment at the routine use of &quot;he&quot; instead of &quot;she&quot;, Dawkins similarly suggests that phrases such as &quot;Catholic child&quot; and &quot;Muslim child&quot; should be considered as socially absurd as, for instance, &quot;Marxist child&quot;, as he believes that children should not be classified based on the ideological or religious beliefs of their parents.

While some critics, such as writer Christopher Hitchens, psychologist Steven Pinker and Nobel laureates Sir Harold Kroto, James D. Watson, and Steven Weinberg have defended Dawkins&#x27;s stance on religion and praised his work, others, including Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist Peter Higgs, astrophysicist Martin Rees, philosopher of science Michael Ruse, literary critic Terry Eagleton, philosopher Roger Scruton, academic and social critic Camille Paglia, atheist philosopher Daniel Came and theologian Alister McGrath, have criticised Dawkins on various grounds, including the assertion that his work simply serves as an atheist counterpart to religious fundamentalism rather than a productive critique of it, and that he has fundamentally misapprehended the foundations of the theological positions he claims to refute. Rees and Higgs, in particular, have both rejected Dawkins&#x27;s confrontational stance toward religion as narrow and &quot;embarrassing&quot;, with Higgs equating Dawkins with the religious fundamentalists he criticises. Atheist philosopher John Gray has denounced Dawkins as an &quot;anti-religious missionary&quot;, whose assertions are &quot;in no sense novel or original&quot;, suggesting that &quot;transfixed in wonderment at the workings of his own mind, Dawkins misses much that is of importance in human beings&quot;. Gray has also criticised Dawkins&#x27;s perceived allegiance to Darwin, stating that if &quot;science, for Darwin, was a method of inquiry that enabled him to edge tentatively and humbly toward the truth, for Dawkins, science is an unquestioned view of the world&quot;. A 2016 study found that many British scientists held an unfavourable view of Dawkins and his attitude towards religion. In response to his critics, Dawkins maintains that theologians are no better than scientists in addressing deep cosmological questions and that he is not a fundamentalist, as he is willing to change his mind in the face of new evidence.

Dawkins has faced backlash over some of his public comments about Islam. In 2013, Dawkins tweeted that &quot;All the world&#x27;s Muslims have fewer Nobel Prizes than Trinity College, Cambridge. They did great things in the Middle Ages, though.&quot; In 2016, Dawkins&#x27; invitation to speak at the Northeast Conference on Science and Skepticism was withdrawn over his sharing of what was characterized as a &quot;highly offensive video&quot; satirically showing cartoon feminist and Islamist characters singing about the things they hold in common. In issuing the tweet, Dawkins stated that it &quot;Obviously doesn&#x27;t apply to vast majority of feminists, among whom I count myself. But the minority are pernicious.&quot;

Dawkins also does not believe in an afterlife.

====Criticism of creationism====
Dawkins is a prominent critic of creationism, a religious belief that humanity, life, and the universe were created by a deity without recourse to evolution. He has described the young Earth creationist view that the Earth is only a few thousand years old as &quot;a preposterous, mind-shrinking falsehood&quot;. His 1986 book, &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;, contains a sustained critique of the argument from design, an important creationist argument. In the book, Dawkins argues against the watchmaker analogy made famous by the eighteenth-century English theologian William Paley via his book &quot;Natural Theology&quot;, in which Paley argues that just as a watch is too complicated and too functional to have sprung into existence merely by accident, so too must all living things—with their far greater complexity—be purposefully designed. Dawkins shares the view generally held by scientists that natural selection is sufficient to explain the apparent functionality and non-random complexity of the biological world, and can be said to play the role of watchmaker in nature, albeit as an automatic, unguided by any designer, nonintelligent, &quot;blind&quot; watchmaker.

In 1986, Dawkins and biologist John Maynard Smith participated in an Oxford Union debate against A. E. Wilder-Smith (a Young Earth creationist) and Edgar Andrews (president of the Biblical Creation Society). In general, however, Dawkins has followed the advice of his late colleague Stephen Jay Gould and refused to participate in formal debates with creationists because &quot;what they seek is the oxygen of respectability&quot;, and doing so would &quot;give them this oxygen by the mere act of &quot;engaging&quot; with them at all&quot;. He suggests that creationists &quot;don&#x27;t mind being beaten in an argument. What matters is that we give them recognition by bothering to argue with them in public.&quot; In a December 2004 interview with American journalist Bill Moyers, Dawkins said that &quot;among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know&quot;. When Moyers questioned him on the use of the word &quot;theory&quot;, Dawkins stated that &quot;evolution has been observed. It&#x27;s just that it hasn&#x27;t been observed while it&#x27;s happening.&quot; He added that &quot;it is rather like a detective coming on a murder after the scene... the detective hasn&#x27;t actually seen the murder take place, of course. But what you do see is a massive clue... Huge quantities of circumstantial evidence. It might as well be spelled out in words of English.&quot;

Dawkins has opposed the inclusion of intelligent design in science education, describing it as &quot;not a scientific argument at all, but a religious one&quot;. He has been referred to in the media as &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Rottweiler&quot;, a reference to English biologist T. H. Huxley, who was known as &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Bulldog&quot; for his advocacy of Charles Darwin&#x27;s evolutionary ideas. He has been a strong critic of the British organisation Truth in Science, which promotes the teaching of creationism in state schools, and whose work Dawkins has described as an &quot;educational scandal&quot;. He plans to subsidise schools through the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science with the delivery of books, DVDs, and pamphlets that counteract their work.

=== Political views ===


Dawkins is an outspoken atheist and a supporter of various atheist, secular, and humanist organisations, including Humanists UK and the Brights movement. Dawkins suggests that atheists should be proud, not apologetic, stressing that atheism is evidence of a healthy, independent mind. He hopes that the more atheists identify themselves, the more the public will become aware of just how many people are nonbelievers, thereby reducing the negative opinion of atheism among the religious majority. Inspired by the gay rights movement, he endorsed the Out Campaign to encourage atheists worldwide to declare their stance publicly. He supported a UK atheist advertising initiative, the Atheist Bus Campaign in 2008 and 2009, which aimed to raise funds to place atheist advertisements on buses in the London area.

Dawkins has expressed concern about the growth of the human population and about the matter of overpopulation. In &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, he briefly mentions population growth, giving the example of Latin America, whose population, at the time the book was written, was doubling every 40 years. He is critical of Roman Catholic attitudes to family planning and population control, stating that leaders who forbid contraception and &quot;express a preference for &#x27;natural&#x27; methods of population limitation&quot; will get just such a method in the form of starvation.

As a supporter of the Great Ape Project—a movement to extend certain moral and legal rights to all great apes—Dawkins contributed the article &#x27;Gaps in the Mind&#x27; to the &quot;Great Ape Project&quot; book edited by Paola Cavalieri and Peter Singer. In this essay, he criticises contemporary society&#x27;s moral attitudes as being based on a &quot;discontinuous, speciesist imperative&quot;.

Dawkins also regularly comments in newspapers and blogs on contemporary political questions and is a frequent contributor to the online science and culture digest &quot;3 Quarks Daily&quot;. His opinions include opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the British nuclear deterrent, the actions of then-US President George W. Bush, and the ethics of designer babies. Several such articles were included in &quot;A Devil&#x27;s Chaplain&quot;, an anthology of writings about science, religion, and politics. He is also a supporter of Republic&#x27;s campaign to replace the British monarchy with a type of democratic republic. Dawkins has described himself as a Labour voter in the 1970s and voter for the Liberal Democrats since the party&#x27;s creation. In 2009, he spoke at the party&#x27;s conference in opposition to blasphemy laws, alternative medicine, and faith schools. In the UK general election of 2010, Dawkins officially endorsed the Liberal Democrats, in support of their campaign for electoral reform and for their &quot;refusal to pander to &#x27;faith. In the run up to the 2017 general election, Dawkins once again endorsed the Liberal Democrats and urged voters to join the party.
In April 2021, Dawkins said on Twitter that &quot;In 2015, Rachel Dolezal, a white chapter president of NAACP, was vilified for identifying as Black. Some men choose to identify as women, and some women choose to identify as men. You will be vilified if you deny that they literally are what they identify as. Discuss.&quot; After receiving criticism for this tweet, Dawkins responded by saying that &quot;I do not intend to disparage trans people. I see that my academic &quot;Discuss&quot; question has been misconstrued as such and I deplore this. It was also not my intent to ally in any way with Republican bigots in US now exploiting this issue.&quot; In a recent interview Dawkins stated regarding trans people that he does not &quot;deny their existence nor does he in anyway oppress them&quot;. He objects to the statement that a &quot;trans woman is a woman because that is a distortion of language and a distortion of science&quot;. The American Humanist Association retracted Dawkins&#x27; 1996 Humanist of the Year Award in response to these comments. Robby Soave of &quot;Reason&quot; magazine criticised the retraction, saying that &quot;The drive to punish dissenters from various orthodoxies is itself illiberal.&quot;

Dawkins has voiced his support for the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation that campaigns for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.

Dawkins identifies as a feminist. He has said that feminism is &quot;enormously important&quot;. Dawkins has been accused by writers such as Amanda Marcotte, Caitlin Dickson, and Adam Lee of misogyny, criticizing those who speak about sexual harassment and abuse while ignoring sexism within the New Atheist movement.

=== Views on postmodernism ===
In 1998, in a book review published in &quot;Nature&quot;, Dawkins expressed his appreciation for two books connected with the Sokal affair: &quot;Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels with Science&quot; by Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt and &quot;Intellectual Impostures&quot; by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont. These books are famous for their criticism of postmodernism in U.S. universities (namely in the departments of literary studies, anthropology, and other cultural studies).

Echoing many critics, Dawkins holds that postmodernism uses obscurantist language to hide its lack of meaningful content. As an example he quotes the psychoanalyst Félix Guattari: &quot;We can clearly see that there is no bi-univocal correspondence between linear signifying links or archi-writing, depending on the author, and this multireferential, multi-dimensional machinic catalysis.&quot; This is explained, Dawkins maintains, by certain intellectuals&#x27; academic ambitions. Figures like Guattari or Lacan, according to Dawkins, have nothing to say but want to reap the benefits of reputation and fame that derive from a successful academic career: &quot;Suppose you are an intellectual impostor with nothing to say, but with strong ambitions to succeed in academic life, collect a coterie of reverent disciples and have students around the world anoint your pages with respectful yellow highlighter. What kind of literary style would you cultivate? Not a lucid one, surely, for clarity would expose your lack of content.&quot;

In 2024, Dawkins co-authored an op-ed in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; with Sokal criticizing the use of the terminology &quot;sex assigned at birth&quot; instead of &quot;sex&quot; by the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dawkins and Sokal argued that sex is an &quot;objective biological reality&quot; that &quot;is determined at conception and is then &quot;observed&quot; at birth,&quot; rather than assigned by a medical professional. Calling this &quot;social constructionism gone amok,&quot; Dawkins and Sokal argued further that &quot;distort[ing] the scientific facts in the service of a social cause&quot; risks undermining trust in medical institutions.

=== Other fields ===
In his role as professor for public understanding of science, Dawkins has been a critic of pseudoscience and alternative medicine. His 1998 book &quot;Unweaving the Rainbow&quot; considers John Keats&#x27;s accusation that by explaining the rainbow, Isaac Newton diminished its beauty; Dawkins argues for the opposite conclusion. He suggests that deep space, the billions of years of life&#x27;s evolution, and the microscopic workings of biology and heredity contain more beauty and wonder than do &quot;myths&quot; and &quot;pseudoscience&quot;. For John Diamond&#x27;s posthumously published &quot;Snake Oil&quot;, a book devoted to debunking alternative medicine, Dawkins wrote a foreword in which he asserts that alternative medicine is harmful, if only because it distracts patients from more successful conventional treatments and gives people false hopes. Dawkins states that &quot;There is no alternative medicine. There is only medicine that works and medicine that doesn&#x27;t work.&quot; In his 2007 Channel 4 TV film &quot;The Enemies of Reason&quot;, Dawkins concluded that Britain is gripped by &quot;an epidemic of superstitious thinking&quot;.

Continuing a long-standing partnership with Channel 4, Dawkins participated in a five-part television series, &quot;Genius of Britain&quot;, along with fellow scientists Stephen Hawking, James Dyson, Paul Nurse, and Jim Al-Khalili. The series was first broadcast in June 2010, and focuses on major British scientific achievements throughout history. In 2014, he joined the global awareness movement Asteroid Day as a &quot;100x Signatory&quot;.

== Awards and recognition ==

He holds honorary doctorates in science from the University of Huddersfield, University of Westminster, Durham University, the University of Hull, the University of Antwerp, the University of Oslo, the University of Aberdeen, Open University, the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, and the University of Valencia. He also holds honorary doctorates of letters from the University of St Andrews and the Australian National University (HonLittD, 1996), and was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1997 and a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2001. He is one of the patrons of the Oxford University Scientific Society.

In 1987, Dawkins received a Royal Society of Literature award and a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; Literary Prize for his book &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;. In the same year, he received a Sci. Tech Prize for Best Television Documentary Science Programme of the Year for his work on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Horizon&quot; episode &quot;The Blind Watchmaker&quot;.

In 1996, the American Humanist Association gave him their Humanist of the Year Award, but the award was withdrawn in 2021, with the statement that he &quot;demean[ed] marginalized groups&quot;, including transgender people, using &quot;the guise of scientific discourse&quot;.

Other awards include the Zoological Society of London&#x27;s Silver Medal (1989), the Finlay Innovation Award (1990), the Michael Faraday Award (1990), the Nakayama Prize (1994), the fifth International Cosmos Prize (1997), the Kistler Prize (2001), the Medal of the Presidency of the Italian Republic (2001), the 2001 and 2012 Emperor Has No Clothes Award from the Freedom From Religion Foundation, the Bicentennial Kelvin Medal of The Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow (2002), the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (2006), and the Nierenberg Prize for Science in the Public Interest (2009). He was awarded the Deschner Award, named after German anti-clerical author Karlheinz Deschner. The Committee for Skeptical Inquiry (CSICOP) has awarded Dawkins their highest award &quot;In Praise of Reason&quot; (1992).
Dawkins topped &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2004 list of the top 100 public British intellectuals, as decided by the readers, receiving twice as many votes as the runner-up. He was shortlisted as a candidate in their 2008 follow-up poll. In a poll held by &quot;Prospect&quot; in 2013, Dawkins was voted the world&#x27;s top thinker based on 65 names chosen by a largely US and UK-based expert panel.

In 2005, the Hamburg-based Alfred Toepfer Foundation awarded him its annual Shakespeare Prize in recognition of his &quot;concise and accessible presentation of scientific knowledge&quot;. He won the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science for 2006, as well as the Galaxy British Book Awards&#x27;s Author of the Year Award for 2007. In the same year, he was listed by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2007, and was ranked 20th in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; 2007 list of 100 greatest living geniuses.

Since 2003, the Atheist Alliance International has awarded a prize during its annual conference, honouring an outstanding atheist whose work has done the most to raise public awareness of atheism during that year; it is known as the Richard Dawkins Award, in honour of Dawkins&#x27;s own efforts.

In February 2010, Dawkins was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation&#x27;s Honorary Board of distinguished achievers. In December 2024, Dawkins resigned from the board, along with Steven Pinker and Jerry Coyne, after the Foundation took down an article &quot;Biology is not Bigotry&quot; by Coyne which supported a biological, rather than a psychological, view of sex.

In 2012, a Sri Lankan team of ichthyologists headed by Rohan Pethiyagoda named a new genus of freshwater fish &quot;Dawkinsia&quot; in Dawkins&#x27;s honor. (Members of this genus were formerly members of the genus &quot;Puntius&quot;).

== Personal life ==
Dawkins has been married four times and has a daughter. On 19 August 1967, Dawkins married ethologist Marian Stamp in the Protestant church in Annestown, County Waterford, Ireland; they divorced in 1984. On 1 June 1984, he married Eve Barham (1951–1999) in Oxford. They had a daughter. Dawkins and Barham divorced. In 1992, he married actress Lalla Ward in Kensington and Chelsea, London. Dawkins met her through their mutual friend Douglas Adams, who had worked with her on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Dawkins and Ward separated in 2016 and they later described the separation as &quot;entirely amicable&quot;. Dawkins is currently married to illustrator Jana Lenzová.

On 6 February 2016, Dawkins suffered a minor haemorrhagic stroke while at home. Dawkins reported later that same year that he had almost completely recovered.

Dawkins owns a first edition of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;.

=== Other appearances ===

Dawkins has made many television appearances on news shows providing his political opinions and especially his views as an atheist. He has been interviewed on the radio, often as part of his book tours. He has debated many religious figures. He has made many university speaking appearances, again often in coordination with his book tours. As of 2016, he has more than 60 credits in the Internet Movie Database where he appeared as himself:
* &quot;&quot; (2008) – as himself, presented as a leading scientific opponent of intelligent design in a film that contends that the mainstream science establishment suppresses academics who believe they see evidence of intelligent design in nature and who criticise evidence supporting Darwinian evolution
* &quot;Doctor Who&quot;: &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot; (2008) – as himself
* &quot;Inside Nature&#x27;s Giants&quot; (2009–12) – as guest expert
* &quot;The Simpsons&quot;: &quot;Black Eyed, Please&quot; (2013) – appears in Ned Flanders&#x27; dream of Hell; provided voice as a demon version of himself
* &quot;Endless Forms Most Beautiful&quot; (2015) – by Nightwish: Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish had Dawkins as a guest star on the album. He provides narration on two tracks: &quot;Shudder Before the Beautiful&quot;, in which he opens the album with one of his own quotes, and &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, inspired by and named after his book &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution&quot;, and in which he quotes &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; by Charles Darwin. He subsequently performed his parts live with Nightwish on 19 December 2015 at the Wembley Arena in London; the concert was later released as a part of a live album/DVD titled &quot;Vehicle of Spirit&quot;.
* &quot;Intersect&quot;, a 2020 American thriller film in which Dawkins provided the voice of Q42/Computer.

== Notes ==
a. W. D. Hamilton influenced Dawkins and the influence can be seen throughout Dawkins&#x27;s book &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;. They became friends at Oxford and following Hamilton&#x27;s death in 2000, Dawkins wrote his obituary and organised a secular memorial service.

b. The debate ended with the motion &quot;That the doctrine of creation is more valid than the theory of evolution&quot; being defeated by 198 votes to 115.

<text>In computer programming and software design, code refactoring is the process of restructuring existing source code—changing the &quot;factoring&quot;—without changing its external behavior. Refactoring is intended to improve the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software (its &quot;non-functional&quot; attributes), while preserving its functionality. Potential advantages of refactoring may include improved code readability and reduced complexity; these can improve the source code″s maintainability and create a simpler, cleaner, or more expressive internal architecture or object model to improve extensibility. Another potential goal for refactoring is improved performance; software engineers face an ongoing challenge to write programs that perform faster or use less memory.

Typically, refactoring applies a series of standardized basic &quot;micro-refactorings&quot;, each of which is (usually) a tiny change in a computer program&#x27;s source code that either preserves the behavior of the software, or at least does not modify its conformance to functional requirements. Many development environments provide automated support for performing the mechanical aspects of these basic refactorings. If done well, code refactoring may help software developers discover and fix hidden or dormant bugs or vulnerabilities in the system by simplifying the underlying logic and eliminating unnecessary levels of complexity. If done poorly, it may fail the requirement that external functionality not be changed, and may thus introduce new bugs.

==Motivation==
Refactoring is usually motivated by noticing a code smell. For example, the method at hand may be very long, or it may be a near duplicate of another nearby method. Once recognized, such problems can be addressed by &quot;refactoring&quot; the source code, or transforming it into a new form that behaves the same as before but that no longer &quot;smells&quot;.

For a long routine, one or more smaller subroutines can be extracted; or for duplicate routines, the duplication can be removed and replaced with one shared function. Failure to perform refactoring can result in accumulating technical debt; on the other hand, refactoring is one of the primary means of repaying technical debt.

==Benefits==
There are two general categories of benefits to the activity of refactoring.
# Maintainability. It is easier to fix bugs because the source code is easy to read and the intent of its author is easy to grasp. This might be achieved by reducing large monolithic routines into a set of individually concise, well-named, single-purpose methods. It might be achieved by moving a method to a more appropriate class, or by removing misleading comments.
# Extensibility. It is easier to extend the capabilities of the application if it uses recognizable design patterns, and it provides some flexibility where none before may have existed.
Performance engineering can remove inefficiencies in programs, known as software bloat, arising from traditional software-development strategies that aim to minimize an application&#x27;s development time rather than the time it takes to run. Performance engineering can also tailor software to the hardware on which it runs, for example, to take advantage of parallel processors and vector units.

==Timing and responsibility==
There are two possible times for refactoring.
# Preventive refactoring – the original developer of the code makes the code more robust when it is still free of smells to prevent the formation of smells in the future.
# Corrective refactoring – a subsequent developer performs refactoring to correct code smells as they occur.

A method that balances preventive and corrective refactoring is &quot;shared responsibility for refactoring&quot;.
This approach splits the refactoring action into two stages and two
roles. The original developer of the code just prepares the code for refactoring, and when the code smells form, a subsequent developer carries out the actual refactoring action.

==Challenges==
Refactoring requires extracting software system structure, data models, and intra-application dependencies to get back knowledge of an existing software system.
The turnover of teams implies missing or inaccurate knowledge of the current state of a system and about design decisions made by departing developers. Further code refactoring activities may require additional effort to regain this knowledge.
Refactoring activities generate architectural modifications that deteriorate the structural architecture of a software system. Such deterioration affects architectural properties such as maintainability and comprehensibility which can lead to a complete re-development of software systems.
Code refactoring activities are secured with software intelligence when using tools and techniques providing data about algorithms and sequences of code execution. Providing a comprehensible format for the inner-state of software system structure, data models, and intra-components dependencies is a critical element to form a high-level understanding and then refined views of what needs to be modified, and how.

==Testing==
Automatic unit tests should be set up before refactoring to ensure routines still behave as expected. Unit tests can bring stability to even large refactors when performed with a single atomic commit. A common strategy to allow safe and atomic refactors spanning multiple projects is to store all projects in a single repository, known as monorepo.

With unit testing in place, refactoring is then an iterative cycle of making a small program transformation, testing it to ensure correctness, and making another small transformation. If at any point a test fails, the last small change is undone and repeated in a different way. Through many small steps the program moves from where it was to where you want it to be. For this very iterative process to be practical, the tests must run very quickly, or the programmer would have to spend a large fraction of their time waiting for the tests to finish. Proponents of extreme programming and other agile software development describe this activity as an integral part of the software development cycle.

==Techniques==
Here are some examples of micro-refactorings; some of these may only apply to certain languages or language types. A longer list can be found in Martin Fowler&#x27;s refactoring book and website. Many development environments provide automated support for these micro-refactorings. For instance, a programmer could click on the name of a variable and then select the &quot;Encapsulate field&quot; refactoring from a context menu. The IDE would then prompt for additional details, typically with sensible defaults and a preview of the code changes. After confirmation by the programmer it would carry out the required changes throughout the code.
===Static analysis===
Static program analysis (called &quot;linting&quot; when performed on less strict interpreted languages) detects problems in a valid but substandard program.

* Program dependence graph - explicit representation of data and control dependencies 
* System dependence graph - representation of procedure calls between PDG 
* Cyclometric complexity analysis.
* Software intelligence - reverse engineers the initial state to understand existing intra-application dependencies

===Transformations===
Transformations modify the syntactic representation of a program. Some modifications alter the semantics or structure of the program in a way which improves its flexibility or robustness. Such modifications require knowledge of the problem domain and intended logic, and thus are infeasible to automate. Modifications exist which make the program easier to read and modify but which to not alter the underlying logic of the program; these transformations can be automated.

* Techniques that allow for more abstraction
** Encapsulate field – force code to access the field with getter and setter methods
** Generalize type – create more general types to allow for more code sharing
** Replace type-checking code with state/strategy
** Replace conditional with polymorphism
* Techniques for breaking code apart into more logical pieces
** Componentization breaks code down into reusable semantic units that present clear, well-defined, simple-to-use interfaces.
** Extract class moves part of the code from an existing class into a new class.
** Extract method, to turn part of a larger method into a new method. By breaking down code in smaller pieces, it is more easily understandable. This is also applicable to functions.
* Techniques for improving names and location of code
** Move method or move field – move to a more appropriate class or source file
** Rename method or rename field – changing the name into a new one that better reveals its purpose
** Pull up – in object-oriented programming (OOP), move to a superclass
** Push down – in OOP, move to a subclass
* Automatic clone detection
==Hardware refactoring==
While the term &quot;refactoring&quot; originally referred exclusively to refactoring of software code, in recent years code written in hardware description languages has also been refactored. The term &quot;hardware refactoring&quot; is used as a shorthand term for refactoring of code in hardware description languages. Since hardware description languages are not considered to be programming languages by most hardware engineers, hardware refactoring is to be considered a separate field from traditional code refactoring.

Automated refactoring of analog hardware descriptions (in VHDL-AMS) has been proposed by Zeng and Huss. In their approach, refactoring preserves the simulated behavior of a hardware design. The non-functional measurement that improves is that refactored code can be processed by standard synthesis tools, while the original code cannot. Refactoring of digital hardware description languages, albeit manual refactoring, has also been investigated by Synopsys fellow Mike Keating. His target is to make complex systems easier to understand, which increases the designers&#x27; productivity.

==History==
The first known use of the term &quot;refactoring&quot; in the published literature was in a September, 1990 article by William Opdyke and Ralph Johnson.
Although refactoring code has been done informally for decades, William Griswold&#x27;s 1991 Ph.D. dissertation
is one of the first major academic works on refactoring functional and procedural programs, followed by William Opdyke&#x27;s 1992 dissertation
on the refactoring of object-oriented programs, although all the theory and machinery have long been available as program transformation systems. All of these resources provide a catalog of common methods for refactoring; a refactoring method has a description of how to apply the method and indicators for when you should (or should not) apply the method.

Martin Fowler&#x27;s book &quot;Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code&quot; is the canonical reference. 

The terms &quot;factoring&quot; and &quot;factoring out&quot; have been used in this way in the Forth community since at least the early 1980s. Chapter Six of Leo Brodie&#x27;s book &quot;Thinking Forth&quot; (1984) is dedicated to the subject.

In extreme programming, the Extract Method refactoring technique has essentially the same meaning as factoring in Forth; to break down a &quot;word&quot; (or function) into smaller, more easily maintained functions.

Refactorings can also be reconstructed posthoc to produce concise descriptions of complex software changes recorded in software repositories like Git.

==Automated code refactoring==

Many software editors and IDEs have automated refactoring support. Here is a list of a few of these editors, or so-called refactoring browsers.
* DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit (Implements large-scale refactoring for C, C++, C#, COBOL, Java, PHP and other languages)
* Eclipse based:
** Eclipse (for Java, and to a lesser extent, C++, PHP, Ruby and JavaScript)
** PyDev (for Python)
* Embarcadero Delphi
* IntelliJ based:
** AppCode (for Objective-C, C and C++)
** IntelliJ IDEA (for Java)
** PyCharm (for Python)
** WebStorm (for JavaScript)
** PhpStorm (for PHP)
** Android Studio (for Java and C++)
* JDeveloper (for Java)
* NetBeans (for Java)
*Smalltalk: Most dialects include powerful refactoring tools. Many use the original refactoring browser produced in the early &#x27;90s by Ralph Johnson.
* Visual Studio based:
** Visual Studio (for .NET and C++)
** Visual Assist (addon for Visual Studio with refactoring support for C# and C++)
* Wing IDE (for Python)
* Xcode (for C, Objective-C, and Swift)
* Qt Creator (for C++, Objective-C and QML)

<text>A relational database (RDB) is a database based on the relational model of data, as proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970.

A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a type of database management system that stores data in a structured format using rows and columns.

Many relational database systems are equipped with the option of using SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying and updating the database.

==History==
The concept of relational database was defined by E. F. Codd at IBM in 1970. Codd introduced the term &quot;relational&quot; in his research paper &quot;A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks&quot;. In this paper and later papers, he defined what he meant by &quot;relation&quot;. One well-known definition of what constitutes a relational database system is composed of Codd&#x27;s 12 rules.

However, no commercial implementations of the relational model conform to all of Codd&#x27;s rules, so the term has gradually come to describe a broader class of database systems, which at a minimum:

# Present the data to the user as relations (a presentation in tabular form, i.e. as a &quot;collection&quot; of tables with each table consisting of a set of rows and columns);
# Provide relational operators to manipulate the data in tabular form.

In 1974, IBM began developing System R, a research project to develop a prototype RDBMS.
The first system sold as an RDBMS was Multics Relational Data Store (June 1976). Oracle was released in 1979 by Relational Software, now Oracle Corporation. Ingres and IBM BS12 followed. Other examples of an RDBMS include IBM Db2, SAP Sybase ASE, and Informix. In 1984, the first RDBMS for Macintosh began being developed, code-named Silver Surfer, and was released in 1987 as 4th Dimension and known today as 4D.

The first systems that were relatively faithful implementations of the relational model were from:

* University of Michigan – Micro DBMS (1969)
* Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1971)
* IBM UK Scientific Centre at Peterlee – IS1 (1970–72), and its successor, PRTV (1973–79).

The most common definition of an RDBMS is a product that presents a view of data as a collection of rows and columns, even if it is not based strictly upon relational theory. By this definition, RDBMS products typically implement some but not all of Codd&#x27;s 12 rules.

A second school of thought argues that if a database does not implement all of Codd&#x27;s rules (or the current understanding on the relational model, as expressed by Christopher J. Date, Hugh Darwen and others), it is not relational. This view, shared by many theorists and other strict adherents to Codd&#x27;s principles, would disqualify most DBMSs as not relational. For clarification, they often refer to some RDBMSs as &quot;truly-relational database management systems&quot; (TRDBMS), naming others &quot;pseudo-relational database management systems&quot; (PRDBMS). 

As of 2009, most commercial relational DBMSs employ SQL as their query language.

Alternative query languages have been proposed and implemented, notably the pre-1996 implementation of Ingres QUEL.

==Relational model==

A relational model organizes data into one or more tables (or &quot;relations&quot;) of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. Rows are also called records or tuples. Columns are also called attributes. Generally, each table/relation represents one &quot;entity type&quot; (such as customer or product). The rows represent instances of that type of entity (such as &quot;Lee&quot; or &quot;chair&quot;) and the columns represent values attributed to that instance (such as address or price).

For example, each row of a class table corresponds to a class, and a class corresponds to multiple students, so the relationship between the class table and the student table is &quot;one to many&quot;

==Keys==
Each row in a table has its own unique key. Rows in a table can be linked to rows in other tables by adding a column for the unique key of the linked row (such columns are known as foreign keys). Codd showed that data relationships of arbitrary complexity can be represented by a simple set of concepts.

Part of this processing involves consistently being able to select or modify one and only one row in a table. Therefore, most physical implementations have a unique primary key (PK) for each row in a table. When a new row is written to the table, a new unique value for the primary key is generated; this is the key that the system uses primarily for accessing the table. System performance is optimized for PKs. Other, more natural keys may also be identified and defined as alternate keys (AK). Often several columns are needed to form an AK (this is one reason why a single integer column is usually made the PK). Both PKs and AKs have the ability to uniquely identify a row within a table. Additional technology may be applied to ensure a unique ID across the world, a globally unique identifier, when there are broader system requirements.

The primary keys within a database are used to define the relationships among the tables. When a PK migrates to another table, it becomes a foreign key (FK) in the other table. When each cell can contain only one value and the PK migrates into a regular entity table, this design pattern can represent either a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship. Most relational database designs resolve many-to-many relationships by creating an additional table that contains the PKs from both of the other entity tables the relationship becomes an entity; the resolution table is then named appropriately and the two FKs are combined to form a PK. The migration of PKs to other tables is the second major reason why system-assigned integers are used normally as PKs; there is usually neither efficiency nor clarity in migrating a bunch of other types of columns.

===Relationships===
Relationships are a logical connection between different tables (entities), established on the basis of interaction among these tables. These relationships can be modelled as an entity-relationship model.

==Transactions==
In order for a database management system (DBMS) to operate efficiently and accurately, it must use ACID transactions.

==Stored procedures==
Part of the programming within a RDBMS is accomplished using stored procedures (SPs). Often procedures can be used to greatly reduce the amount of information transferred within and outside of a system. For increased security, the system design may grant access to only the stored procedures and not directly to the tables. Fundamental stored procedures contain the logic needed to insert new and update existing data. More complex procedures may be written to implement additional rules and logic related to processing or selecting the data.

==Terminology==

The relational database was first defined in June 1970 by Edgar Codd, of IBM&#x27;s San Jose Research Laboratory. Codd&#x27;s view of what qualifies as an RDBMS is summarized in Codd&#x27;s 12 rules. A relational database has become the predominant type of database. Other models besides the &quot;relational model&quot; include the hierarchical database model and the network model.

The table below summarizes some of the most important relational database terms and the corresponding SQL term:

==Relations or tables==

In a relational database, a &quot;relation&quot; is a set of tuples that have the same attributes. A tuple usually represents an object and information about that object. Objects are typically physical objects or concepts. A relation is usually described as a table, which is organized into rows and columns. All the data referenced by an attribute are in the same domain and conform to the same constraints.

The relational model specifies that the tuples of a relation have no specific order and that the tuples, in turn, impose no order on the attributes. Applications access data by specifying queries, which use operations such as &quot;select&quot; to identify tuples, &quot;project&quot; to identify attributes, and &quot;join&quot; to combine relations. Relations can be modified using the &quot;insert&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;, and &quot;update&quot; operators. New tuples can supply explicit values or be derived from a query. Similarly, queries identify tuples for updating or deleting.

Tuples by definition are unique. If the tuple contains a candidate or primary key then obviously it is unique; however, a primary key need not be defined for a row or record to be a tuple. The definition of a tuple requires that it be unique, but does not require a primary key to be defined. Because a tuple is unique, its attributes by definition constitute a superkey.

==Base and derived relations==

All data are stored and accessed via relations. Relations that store data are called &quot;base relations&quot;, and in implementations are called &quot;tables&quot;. Other relations do not store data, but are computed by applying relational operations to other relations. These relations are sometimes called &quot;derived relations&quot;. In implementations these are called &quot;views&quot; or &quot;queries&quot;. Derived relations are convenient in that they act as a single relation, even though they may grab information from several relations. Also, derived relations can be used as an abstraction layer.

===Domain===

A domain describes the set of possible values for a given attribute, and can be considered a constraint on the value of the attribute. Mathematically, attaching a domain to an attribute means that any value for the attribute must be an element of the specified set. The character string &quot;ABC&quot;, for instance, is not in the integer domain, but the integer value &quot;123&quot; is. Another example of domain describes the possible values for the field &quot;CoinFace&quot; as (&quot;Heads&quot;,&quot;Tails&quot;). So, the field &quot;CoinFace&quot; will not accept input values like (0,1) or (H,T).

==Constraints==
Constraints are often used to make it possible to further restrict the domain of an attribute. For instance, a constraint can restrict a given integer attribute to values between 1 and 10. Constraints provide one method of implementing business rules in the database and support subsequent data use within the application layer. SQL implements constraint functionality in the form of check constraints.
Constraints restrict the data that can be stored in relations. These are usually defined using expressions that result in a Boolean value, indicating whether or not the data satisfies the constraint. Constraints can apply to single attributes, to a tuple (restricting combinations of attributes) or to an entire relation.
Since every attribute has an associated domain, there are constraints (domain constraints). The two principal rules for the relational model are known as entity integrity and referential integrity.

===Primary key===

Every relation/table has a primary key, this being a consequence of a relation being a set. A primary key uniquely specifies a tuple within a table. While natural attributes (attributes used to describe the data being entered) are sometimes good primary keys, surrogate keys are often used instead. A surrogate key is an artificial attribute assigned to an object which uniquely identifies it (for instance, in a table of information about students at a school they might all be assigned a student ID in order to differentiate them). The surrogate key has no intrinsic (inherent) meaning, but rather is useful through its ability to uniquely identify a tuple.
Another common occurrence, especially in regard to N:M cardinality is the composite key. A composite key is a key made up of two or more attributes within a table that (together) uniquely identify a record.

===Foreign key===

Foreign key refers to a field in a relational table that matches the primary key column of another table. It relates the two keys. Foreign keys need not have unique values in the referencing relation. A foreign key can be used to cross-reference tables, and it effectively uses the values of attributes in the referenced relation to restrict the domain of one or more attributes in the referencing relation. The concept is described formally as: &quot;For all tuples in the referencing relation projected over the referencing attributes, there must exist a tuple in the referenced relation projected over those same attributes such that the values in each of the referencing attributes match the corresponding values in the referenced attributes.&quot;

===Stored procedures===

A stored procedure is executable code that is associated with, and generally stored in, the database. Stored procedures usually collect and customize common operations, like inserting a tuple into a relation, gathering statistical information about usage patterns, or encapsulating complex business logic and calculations. Frequently they are used as an application programming interface (API) for security or simplicity. Implementations of stored procedures on SQL RDBMS&#x27;s often allow developers to take advantage of procedural extensions (often vendor-specific) to the standard declarative SQL syntax.
Stored procedures are not part of the relational database model, but all commercial implementations include them.

===Index===

An index is one way of providing quicker access to data. Indices can be created on any combination of attributes on a relation. Queries that filter using those attributes can find matching tuples directly using the index (similar to Hash table lookup), without having to check each tuple in turn. This is analogous to using the index of a book to go directly to the page on which the information you are looking for is found, so that you do not have to read the entire book to find what you are looking for. Relational databases typically supply multiple indexing techniques, each of which is optimal for some combination of data distribution, relation size, and typical access pattern. Indices are usually implemented via B+ trees, R-trees, and bitmaps.
Indices are usually not considered part of the database, as they are considered an implementation detail, though indices are usually maintained by the same group that maintains the other parts of the database. The use of efficient indexes on both primary and foreign keys can dramatically improve query performance. This is because B-tree indexes result in query times proportional to log(n) where n is the number of rows in a table and hash indexes result in constant time queries (no size dependency as long as the relevant part of the index fits into memory).

==Relational operations==

Queries made against the relational database, and the derived relvars in the database are expressed in a relational calculus or a relational algebra. In his original relational algebra, Codd introduced eight relational operators in two groups of four operators each. The first four operators were based on the traditional mathematical set operations:
* The union operator (υ) combines the tuples of two relations and removes all duplicate tuples from the result. The relational union operator is equivalent to the SQL UNION operator.
* The intersection operator (∩) produces the set of tuples that two relations share in common. Intersection is implemented in SQL in the form of the INTERSECT operator.
* The set difference operator (-) acts on two relations and produces the set of tuples from the first relation that do not exist in the second relation. Difference is implemented in SQL in the form of the EXCEPT or MINUS operator.
* The cartesian product (X) of two relations is a join that is not restricted by any criteria, resulting in every tuple of the first relation being matched with every tuple of the second relation. The cartesian product is implemented in SQL as the Cross join operator.
The remaining operators proposed by Codd involve special operations specific to relational databases:
* The selection, or restriction, operation (σ) retrieves tuples from a relation, limiting the results to only those that meet a specific criterion, i.e. a subset in terms of set theory. The SQL equivalent of selection is the SELECT query statement with a WHERE clause.
* The projection operation (π) extracts only the specified attributes from a tuple or set of tuples.
* The join operation defined for relational databases is often referred to as a natural join (⋈). In this type of join, two relations are connected by their common attributes. MySQL&#x27;s approximation of a natural join is the Inner join operator. In SQL, an INNER JOIN prevents a cartesian product from occurring when there are two tables in a query. For each table added to a SQL Query, one additional INNER JOIN is added to prevent a cartesian product. Thus, for N tables in an SQL query, there must be N−1 INNER JOINS to prevent a cartesian product.
* The relational division (÷) operation is a slightly more complex operation and essentially involves using the tuples of one relation (the dividend) to partition a second relation (the divisor). The relational division operator is effectively the opposite of the cartesian product operator (hence the name).
Other operators have been introduced or proposed since Codd&#x27;s introduction of the original eight including relational comparison operators and extensions that offer support for nesting and hierarchical data, among others.

==Normalization==

Normalization was first proposed by Codd as an integral part of the relational model. It encompasses a set of procedures designed to eliminate non-simple domains (non-atomic values) and the redundancy (duplication) of data, which in turn prevents data manipulation anomalies and loss of data integrity. The most common forms of normalization applied to databases are called the normal forms.

==RDBMS==
Connolly and Begg define database management system (DBMS) as a &quot;software system that enables users to define, create, maintain and control access to the database&quot;. RDBMS is an extension of that initialism that is sometimes used when the underlying database is relational.

An alternative definition for a relational database management system is a database management system (DBMS) based on the relational model. Most databases in widespread use today are based on this model.

RDBMSs have been a common option for the storage of information in databases used for financial records, manufacturing and logistical information, personnel data, and other applications since the 1980s. Relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases and network databases, because RDBMS were easier to implement and administer. Nonetheless, relational stored data received continued, unsuccessful challenges by object database management systems in the 1980s and 1990s, (which were introduced in an attempt to address the so-called object–relational impedance mismatch between relational databases and object-oriented application programs), as well as by XML database management systems in the 1990s. However, due to the expanse of technologies, such as horizontal scaling of computer clusters, NoSQL databases have recently become popular as an alternative to RDBMS databases.

==Distributed relational databases==
Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) was designed by a workgroup within IBM in the period 1988 to 1994. DRDA enables network connected relational databases to cooperate to fulfill SQL requests.
The messages, protocols, and structural components of DRDA are defined by the Distributed Data Management Architecture.

==List of database engines==
According to DB-Engines, in December 2024 the most popular systems on the db-engines.com web site were:
# Oracle Database
# MySQL
# Microsoft SQL Server
# PostgreSQL
# Snowflake
# IBM Db2
# SQLite
# Microsoft Access
# Databricks
# MariaDB

According to research company Gartner, in 2011, the five leading proprietary software relational database vendors by revenue were Oracle (48.8%), IBM (20.2%), Microsoft (17.0%), SAP including Sybase (4.6%), and Teradata (3.7%).

<doc id="25874" wikidata="Q852724" url="?curid=25874" title="Rule of Saint Benedict">
<text>The Rule of Saint Benedict () is a book of precepts written in Latin by St. Benedict of Nursia (c. AD 480–550) for monks living communally under the authority of an abbot.

The spirit of Saint Benedict&#x27;s Rule is summed up in the motto of the Benedictine Confederation: &quot;pax&quot; (&quot;peace&quot;) and the traditional &quot;ora et labora&quot; (&quot;pray and work&quot;). Compared to other precepts, the Rule provides a moderate path between individual zeal and formulaic institutionalism; because of this middle ground, it has been widely popular. Benedict&#x27;s concerns were his views of the needs of monks in a community environment: namely, to establish due order, to foster an understanding of the relational nature of human beings, and to provide a spiritual father to support and strengthen the individual&#x27;s ascetic effort and the spiritual growth that is required for the fulfillment of the human vocation, theosis.

The &quot;Rule of Saint Benedict&quot; has been used by Benedictines for 15 centuries, and thus St. Benedict is sometimes regarded as the founder of Western monasticism due to the reforming influence that his rules had on the then-current Catholic hierarchy. There is, however, no evidence to suggest that Benedict intended to found a religious order in the modern sense, and it was not until the Late Middle Ages that mention was made of an &quot;Order of Saint Benedict&quot;. His &quot;Rule&quot; was written as a guide for individual, autonomous communities, and all Benedictine Houses (and the Congregations in which they have grouped themselves) still remain self-governing. Advantages seen in retaining this unique Benedictine emphasis on autonomy include cultivating models of tightly bonded communities and contemplative lifestyles. Perceived disadvantages comprise geographical isolation from important activities in adjacent communities. Other perceived losses include inefficiency and lack of mobility in the service of others, and insufficient appeal to potential members. These different emphases emerged within the framework of the Rule in the course of history and are to some extent present within the Benedictine Confederation and the Cistercian Orders of the Common and the Strict Observance.

==Origins==
Christian monasticism first appeared in the Egyptian desert, before Benedict of Nursia. Under the inspiration of Saint Anthony the Great (251–356), ascetic monks led by Saint Pachomius (286–346) formed the first Christian monastic communities under what became known as an &quot;Abbot&quot;, from the Aramaic &quot;abba&quot; (father).Within a generation, both solitary as well as communal monasticism became very popular and spread outside of Egypt, first to Palestine and the Judean Desert and thence to Syria and North Africa. Saint Basil of Caesarea codified the precepts for these eastern monasteries in his Ascetic Rule, or &quot;Ascetica&quot;, which is still used today in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

In the West in about the year 500, Benedict became so upset by the immorality of society in Rome that he gave up his studies there, at age fourteen, and chose the life of an ascetic monk in the pursuit of personal holiness, living as a hermit in a cave near the rugged region of Subiaco. In time, setting an example with his zeal, he began to attract disciples. After considerable initial struggles with his first community at Subiaco, he eventually founded the monastery of Monte Cassino in 529, where he wrote his Rule near the end of his life.

In chapter 73, Saint Benedict commends the Rule of Saint Basil and alludes to further authorities. He was probably aware of the Rule written by Pachomius (or attributed to him), and his Rule also shows influence by the Rule of St Augustine of Hippo and the writings of Saint John Cassian. Benedict&#x27;s greatest debt, however, may be to the anonymous document known as the Rule of the Master, which Benedict seems to have radically excised, expanded, revised and corrected in the light of his own considerable experience and insight. Saint Benedict&#x27;s work expounded upon preconceived ideas that were present in the religious community only making minor changes more in line with the time period relevant to his system.

The &quot;Rule&quot; was translated into Armenian by Nerses of Lampron in the 10th century and is used by the Armenian Catholic Mekhitarists today. It was also translated into Old English by Æthelwold.

==Overview==
The &quot;Rule&quot; opens with a hortatory preface, drawing on the &quot;Admonitio ad filium spiritualem&quot;, in which Saint Benedict sets forth the main principles of the religious life, &quot;viz.&quot;: the renunciation of one&#x27;s own will and arming oneself &quot;with the strong and noble weapons of obedience&quot; under the banner of &quot;the true King, Christ the Lord&quot; (Prol. 3). He proposes to establish a &quot;school for the Lord&#x27;s service&quot; (Prol. 45) in which the &quot;way to salvation&quot; (Prol. 48) shall be taught, so that by persevering in the monastery till death his disciples may &quot;through patience share in the passion of Christ that [they] may deserve also to share in his Kingdom&quot; (Prol. 50, &quot;passionibus Christi per patientiam participemur, ut et regno eius mereamur esse consortes&quot;; note: Latin and have the same root, &quot;cf.&quot; Fry, RB 1980, p.167).

*Chapter 1 defines four kinds of monk: 
# Cenobites, those &quot;in a monastery, where they serve under a rule and an abbot&quot;.
# Anchorites, or hermits, who, after long successful training in a monastery, are now coping single-handedly, with only God for their help.
# Sarabaites, living by twos and threes together or even alone, with no experience, rule and superior, and thus a law unto themselves.
# Gyrovagues, wandering from one monastery to another, slaves to their own wills and appetites.

*Chapter 2 describes the necessary qualifications of an abbot, forbids the abbot to make distinctions between persons in the monastery except for particular merit, and warns him that he will be answerable for the salvation of the souls in his care.
*Chapter 3 ordains the calling of the brothers to council upon all affairs of importance to the community.
*Chapter 4 lists 73 &quot;tools for good work&quot;, &quot;tools of the spiritual craft&quot; for the &quot;workshop&quot; that is &quot;the enclosure of the monastery and the stability in the community&quot;. These are essentially the duties of every Christian and are mainly Scriptural either in letter or in spirit.
*Chapter 5 prescribes prompt, ungrudging, and absolute obedience to the superior in all things lawful, &quot;unhesitating obedience&quot; being called the first step (Latin ) of humility.
*Chapter 6 recommends taciturnity (Latin ), i.e. the state or quality of being reserved or reticent in conversation, in the use of speech.
*Chapter 7 divides humility into twelve steps forming rungs in a ladder that leads to heaven:(1) Fear God; (2) Subordinate one&#x27;s will to the will of God; (3) Be obedient to one&#x27;s superior; (4) Be patient amid hardships; (5) Confess one&#x27;s sins; (6) Accept the meanest of tasks, and hold oneself as a &quot;worthless workman&quot;; (7) Consider oneself &quot;inferior to all&quot;; (8) Follow examples set by superiors; (9) Do not speak until spoken to; (10) Do not readily laugh; (11) Speak simply and modestly; and (12) Express one&#x27;s inward humility through bodily posture.
*Chapter 8–19 regulate the Divine Office, the Godly work to which &quot;nothing is to be preferred&quot;, namely the eight canonical hours. Detailed arrangements are made for the number of Psalms, etc., to be recited in winter and summer, on Sundays, weekdays, Holy Days, and at other times.
*Chapter 19 emphasizes the reverence owed to the omnipresent God.
*Chapter 20 directs that prayer be made with heartfelt compunction rather than many words. It should be prolonged only under the inspiration of divine grace, and in community always kept short and terminated at a sign from the superior.
*Chapter 21 regulates the appointment of a Dean over every ten monks.
*Chapter 22 regulates the dormitory. Each monk is to have a separate bed and is to sleep in his habit, so as to be ready to rise without delay for the Divine Office at night; a candle (Latin &quot;candela&quot;) shall burn in the dormitory throughout the night.
*Chapters 23–29 specify a graduated scale of punishments for contumacy (refusal to obey authority), disobedience, pride, and other grave faults: first, private admonition; next, public reproof; then separation from the brothers at meals and elsewhere; and finally excommunication (or in the case of those lacking understanding of what this means, corporal punishment instead).
*Chapter 30 directs that a wayward brother who has left the monastery must be received again, if he promises to make amends; but if he leaves again, and again, after his third departure all return is finally barred.
*Chapters 31 &amp; 32 order the appointment of officials to take charge of the goods of the monastery.
*Chapter 33 forbids the private possession of anything without the leave of the abbot, who is, however, bound to supply all necessities.
*Chapter 34 prescribes a just distribution of such things.
*Chapter 35 arranges for the service in the kitchen by all monks in turn.
*Chapters 36 &amp; 37 address care of the sick, the old, and the young. They are to have certain dispensations from the strict Rule, chiefly in the matter of food.
*Chapter 38 prescribes reading aloud during meals, which duty is to be performed by those who can do so with edification to the rest. Signs are to be used for whatever may be wanted at meals, so that no voice interrupts the reading. The reader eats with the servers after the rest have finished, but he is allowed a little food beforehand in order to lessen the fatigue of reading.
*Chapters 39 &amp; 40 regulate the quantity and quality of the food. Two meals a day are allowed, with two cooked dishes at each. Each monk is allowed a pound of bread and a hemina (about a quarter litre) of wine. The flesh of four-footed animals is prohibited except for the sick and the weak.
*Chapter 41 prescribes the hours of the meals, which vary with the time of year.
*Chapter 42 enjoins the reading of an edifying book in the evening, and orders strict silence after Compline.
*Chapters 43–46 define penalties for minor faults, such as coming late to prayer or meals.
*Chapter 47 requires the abbot to call the brothers to the &quot;work of God&quot; (&quot;Opus Dei&quot;) in choir, and to appoint chanters and readers.
*Chapter 48 emphasizes the importance of daily manual labour appropriate to the ability of the monk. The duration of labour varies with the season but is never less than five hours a day.
*Chapter 49 recommends some voluntary self-denial for Lent, with the abbot&#x27;s sanction.
*Chapters 50 &amp; 51 contain rules for monks working in the fields or travelling. They are directed to join in spirit, as far as possible, with their brothers in the monastery at the regular hours of prayers.
*Chapter 52 commands that the oratory be used for purposes of devotion only.
*Chapter 53 deals with hospitality. Guests are to be met with due courtesy by the abbot or his deputy; during their stay they are to be under the special protection of an appointed monk; they are not to associate with the rest of the community except by special permission.
*Chapter 54 forbids the monks to receive letters or gifts without the abbot&#x27;s leave.
*Chapter 55 says clothing is to be adequate and suited to the climate and locality, at the discretion of the abbot. It must be as plain and cheap as is consistent with due economy. Each monk is to have a change of clothes to allow for washing, and when travelling is to have clothes of better quality. Old clothes are to be given to the poor.
*Chapter 56 directs the abbot to eat with the guests.
*Chapter 57 enjoins humility on the craftsmen of the monastery, and if their work is for sale, it shall be rather below than above the current trade price.
*Chapter 58 lays down rules for the admission of new members, which is not to be made too easy. The postulant first spends a short time as a guest; then he is admitted to the novitiate where his vocation is severely tested; during this time he is always free to leave. If after twelve months&#x27; probation he perseveres, he may promise before the whole community &quot;stabilitate sua et conversatione morum suorum et oboedientia&quot; – &quot;stability, conversion of manners, and obedience&quot;. With this vow he binds himself for life to the monastery of his profession.
*Chapter 59 describes the ceremony of indenturing young boys into the monastery and arranges certain financial arrangements for this.
*Chapter 60 regulates the position of priests who join the community. They are to set an example of humility, and can only exercise their priestly functions by permission of the abbot.
*Chapter 61 provides for the reception of foreign monks as guests, and for their admission to the community.
*Chapter 62 deals with the ordination of priests from within the monastic community.
*Chapter 63 lays down that precedence in the community shall be determined by the date of admission, merit of life, or the appointment of the abbot.
*Chapter 64 orders that the abbot be elected by his monks, and that he be chosen for his charity, zeal, and discretion.
*Chapter 65 allows the appointment of a prior or deputy superior, but warns that he is to be entirely subject to the abbot and may be admonished, deposed, or expelled for misconduct.
*Chapter 66 appoints a porter, and recommends that each monastery be self-contained and avoid intercourse with the outer world.
*Chapter 67 instructs monks how to behave on a journey.
*Chapter 68 orders that all cheerfully try to do whatever is commanded, however apparently impossible it may seem.
*Chapter 69 forbids the monks from defending one another.
*Chapter 70 prohibits them from beating (Latin ) or excommunicating one another.
*Chapter 71 encourages the brothers to be obedient not only to the abbot and his officials, but also to one another.
*Chapter 72 briefly exhorts the monks to zeal and fraternal charity.
*Chapter 73 is an epilogue; it declares that the Rule is not offered as an ideal of perfection, but merely as a means towards godliness, intended chiefly for beginners in the spiritual life.

==Outline of the Benedictine life==

Saint Benedict&#x27;s model for the monastic life was the family, with the abbot as father and all the monks as brothers. Priesthood was not initially an important part of Benedictine monasticism – monks used the services of their local priest. Because of this, almost all the Rule is applicable to communities of women under the authority of an abbess. This appeal to multiple groups would later make the Rule of Saint Benedict an integral set of guidelines for the development of the Christian faith.

Saint Benedict&#x27;s Rule organises the monastic day into regular periods of communal and private prayer, sleep, spiritual reading, and manual labour – &quot;ut in omnibus glorificetur Deus&quot;, &quot;that in all [things] God may be glorified&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; Rule ch. 57.9). In later centuries, intellectual work and teaching took the place of farming, crafts, or other forms of manual labour for many – if not most – Benedictines.

Traditionally, the daily life of the Benedictine revolved around the eight canonical hours. The monastic timetable, or Horarium, would begin at midnight with the service, or &quot;office&quot;, of &quot;Matins&quot; (today also called the Office of Readings), followed by the morning office of &quot;Lauds&quot; at 3 am. Before the advent of wax candles in the 14th century, this office was said in the dark or with minimal lighting; and monks were expected to memorise everything. These services could be very long, sometimes lasting till dawn, but usually consisted of a chant, three antiphons, three psalms, and three lessons, along with celebrations of any local saints&#x27; days. Afterwards the monks would retire for a few hours of sleep and then rise at 6am to wash and attend the office of &quot;Prime&quot;. They then gathered in &quot;Chapter&quot; to receive instructions for the day and to attend to any judicial business. Then came private Mass or spiritual reading or work until 9am when the office of &quot;Terce&quot; was said, and then High Mass. At noon came the office of &quot;Sext&quot; and the midday meal. After a brief period of communal recreation, the monk could retire to rest until the office of &quot;None&quot; at 3pm. This was followed by farming and housekeeping work until after twilight, the evening prayer of &quot;Vespers&quot; at 6pm, then the night prayer of &quot;Compline&quot; at 9pm, and retiring to bed, before beginning the cycle again. In modern times, this timetable is often changed to accommodate any apostolate outside the monastic enclosure (e.g. the running of a school or parish).

Many Benedictine Houses have a number of &quot;Oblates (secular)&quot; who are affiliated with them in prayer, having made a formal private promise (usually renewed annually) to follow the Rule of St Benedict in their private life as closely as their individual circumstances and prior commitments permit.

In recent years discussions have occasionally been held concerning the applicability of the principles and spirit of the Rule of Saint Benedict to the secular working environment.

==Reforms==
During the more than 1500 years of their existence, Benedictines have seen cycles of flourish and decline. Several reform movements sought more intense devotion to both the letter and spirit of the Rule of St Benedict, at least as they understood it. Examples include the Camaldolese, the Cistercians, the Trappists (a reform of the Cistercians), and the Sylvestrines.

==Secular significance==
Charlemagne had Benedict&#x27;s Rule copied and distributed to encourage monks throughout western Europe to follow it as a standard. Beyond its religious influences, the Rule of St Benedict was one of the most important written works to shape medieval Europe, embodying the ideas of a written constitution and the rule of law. It also incorporated a degree of democracy in a non-democratic society, and dignified manual labor.

==Popular motto &quot;Ora et labora&quot;==
Although not stated explicitly in the rule, the motto Ora et labora is widely considered to be a shortform capturing the spirit of the rule.

<doc id="25875" wikidata="Q187255" url="?curid=25875" title="Rheumatoid arthritis">
<text>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term autoimmune disorder that primarily affects joints. It typically results in warm, swollen, and painful joints. Pain and stiffness often worsen following rest. Most commonly, the wrist and hands are involved, with the same joints typically involved on both sides of the body. The disease may also affect other parts of the body, including skin, eyes, lungs, heart, nerves, and blood. This may result in a low red blood cell count, inflammation around the lungs, and inflammation around the heart. Fever and low energy may also be present. Often, symptoms come on gradually over weeks to months.

While the cause of rheumatoid arthritis is not clear, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The underlying mechanism involves the body&#x27;s immune system attacking the joints. This results in inflammation and thickening of the joint capsule. It also affects the underlying bone and cartilage. The diagnosis is made mostly on the basis of a person&#x27;s signs and symptoms. X-rays and laboratory testing may support a diagnosis or exclude other diseases with similar symptoms. Other diseases that may present similarly include systemic lupus erythematosus, psoriatic arthritis, and fibromyalgia among others.

The goals of treatment are to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person&#x27;s overall functioning. This may be helped by balancing rest and exercise, the use of splints and braces, or the use of assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when the disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations.

RA affects about 24.5 million people as of 2015. This is 0.5–1% of adults in the developed world with between 5 and 50 per 100,000 people newly developing the condition each year. Onset is most frequent during middle age and women are affected 2.5 times as frequently as men. It resulted in 38,000 deaths in 2013, up from 28,000 deaths in 1990. The first recognized description of RA was made in 1800 by Dr. Augustin Jacob Landré-Beauvais (1772–1840) of Paris. The term &quot;rheumatoid arthritis&quot; is based on the Greek for watery and inflamed joints.
==Signs and symptoms==
RA primarily affects joints, but it also affects other organs in more than 15–25% of cases. Associated problems include cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, interstitial lung disease, infection, cancer, feeling tired, depression, mental difficulties, and trouble working.

===Joints===

Arthritis of joints involves inflammation of the synovial membrane. Joints become swollen, tender and warm, and stiffness limits their movement. With time, multiple joints are affected (polyarthritis). Most commonly involved are the small joints of the hands, feet and cervical spine, but larger joints like the shoulder and knee can also be involved. Synovitis can lead to tethering of tissue with loss of movement and erosion of the joint surface causing deformity and loss of function. The fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), highly specialized mesenchymal cells found in the synovial membrane, have an active and prominent role in these pathogenic processes of the rheumatic joints.

RA typically manifests with signs of inflammation, with the affected joints being swollen, warm, painful and stiff, particularly early in the morning on waking or following prolonged inactivity. Increased stiffness early in the morning is often a prominent feature of the disease and typically lasts for more than an hour. Gentle movements may relieve symptoms in early stages of the disease. These signs help distinguish rheumatoid from non-inflammatory problems of the joints, such as osteoarthritis. In arthritis of non-inflammatory causes, signs of inflammation and early morning stiffness are less prominent.
The pain associated with RA is induced at the site of inflammation and classified as nociceptive as opposed to neuropathic. The joints are often affected in a fairly symmetrical fashion, although this is not specific, and the initial presentation may be asymmetrical.

As the pathology progresses the inflammatory activity leads to tendon tethering and erosion and destruction of the joint surface, which impairs range of movement and leads to deformity. The fingers may develop almost any deformity depending on which joints are most involved. Specific deformities, which also occur in osteoarthritis, include ulnar deviation, boutonniere deformity (also &quot;buttonhole deformity&quot;, flexion of proximal interphalangeal joint and extension of distal interphalangeal joint of the hand), swan neck deformity (hyperextension at proximal interphalangeal joint and flexion at distal interphalangeal joint) and &quot;Z-thumb.&quot; &quot;Z-thumb&quot; or &quot;Z-deformity&quot; consists of hyperextension of the interphalangeal joint, fixed flexion and subluxation of the metacarpophalangeal joint and gives a &quot;Z&quot; appearance to the thumb. The hammer toe deformity may be seen. In the worst case, joints are known as arthritis mutilans due to the mutilating nature of the deformities.

===Skin===
The rheumatoid nodule, which is sometimes in the skin, is the most common non-joint feature and occurs in 30% of people who have RA. It is a type of inflammatory reaction known to pathologists as a &quot;necrotizing granuloma&quot;. The initial pathologic process in nodule formation is unknown but may be essentially the same as the synovitis, since similar structural features occur in both. The nodule has a central area of fibrinoid necrosis that may be fissured and which corresponds to the fibrin-rich necrotic material found in and around an affected synovial space. Surrounding the necrosis is a layer of palisading macrophages and fibroblasts, corresponding to the intimal layer in synovium and a cuff of connective tissue containing clusters of lymphocytes and plasma cells, corresponding to the subintimal zone in synovitis. The typical rheumatoid nodule may be a few millimetres to a few centimetres in diameter and is usually found over bony prominences, such as the elbow, the heel, the knuckles, or other areas that sustain repeated mechanical stress. Nodules are associated with a positive RF (rheumatoid factor) titer, ACPA, and severe erosive arthritis. Rarely, these can occur in internal organs or at diverse sites on the body.

Several forms of vasculitis occur in RA, but are mostly seen with long-standing and untreated disease. The most common presentation is due to involvement of small- and medium-sized vessels. Rheumatoid vasculitis can thus commonly present with skin ulceration and vasculitic nerve infarction known as mononeuritis multiplex.

Other, rather rare, skin associated symptoms include pyoderma gangrenosum, Sweet&#x27;s syndrome, drug reactions, erythema nodosum, lobe panniculitis, atrophy of finger skin, palmar erythema, and skin fragility (often worsened by corticosteroid use).

Diffuse alopecia areata (Diffuse AA) occurs more commonly in people with rheumatoid arthritis. RA is also seen more often in those with relatives who have AA.

===Lungs===

Lung fibrosis is a recognized complication of rheumatoid arthritis. It is also a rare but well-recognized consequence of therapy (for example with methotrexate and leflunomide). Caplan&#x27;s syndrome describes lung nodules in individuals with RA and additional exposure to coal dust. Exudative pleural effusions are also associated with RA.

===Heart and blood vessels===
People with RA are more prone to atherosclerosis, and risk of myocardial infarction (heart attack) and stroke is markedly increased.
Other possible complications that may arise include: pericarditis, endocarditis, left ventricular failure, valvulitis and fibrosis. Many people with RA do not experience the same chest pain that others feel when they have angina or myocardial infarction. To reduce cardiovascular risk, it is crucial to maintain optimal control of the inflammation caused by RA (which may be involved in causing the cardiovascular risk), and to use exercise and medications appropriately to reduce other cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids and blood pressure. Doctors who treat people with RA should be sensitive to cardiovascular risk when prescribing anti-inflammatory medications, and may want to consider prescribing routine use of low doses of aspirin if the gastrointestinal effects are tolerable.

===Blood===
Anemia is by far the most common abnormality of the blood cells which can be caused by a variety of mechanisms. The chronic inflammation caused by RA leads to raised hepcidin levels, leading to anemia of chronic disease where iron is poorly absorbed and also sequestered into macrophages. The red cells are of normal size and color (normocytic and Normochromic).

A low white blood cell count usually only occurs in people with Felty&#x27;s syndrome with an enlarged liver and spleen. The mechanism of neutropenia is complex. An increased platelet count occurs when inflammation is uncontrolled.

===Other===
The role of the circadian clock in rheumatoid arthritis suggests a correlation between an early morning rise in circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 and painful morning joint stiffness.

==== Kidneys ====
Renal amyloidosis can occur as a consequence of untreated chronic inflammation. Treatment with penicillamine or gold salts such as sodium aurothiomalate are recognized causes of membranous nephropathy.

==== Eyes ====
The eye can be directly affected in the form of episcleritis or scleritis, which when severe can very rarely progress to perforating scleromalacia. Rather more common is the indirect effect of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, which is a dryness of eyes and mouth caused by lymphocyte infiltration of lacrimal and salivary glands. When severe, dryness of the cornea can lead to keratitis and loss of vision as well as being painful. Preventive treatment of severe dryness with measures such as nasolacrimal duct blockage is important.

==== Liver ====
Liver problems in people with rheumatoid arthritis may be due to the underlying disease process or as a result of the medications used to treat the disease. A coexisting autoimmune liver disease, such as primary biliary cirrhosis or autoimmune hepatitis may also cause problems.

==== Neurological ====
Peripheral neuropathy and mononeuritis multiplex may occur. The most common problem is carpal tunnel syndrome caused by compression of the median nerve by swelling around the wrist.

Rheumatoid disease of the spine can lead to myelopathy. 
Atlanto-axial subluxation can occur, owing to erosion of the odontoid process or transverse ligaments in the cervical spine connection to the skull. Such an erosion (&gt;3mm) can give rise to vertebrae slipping over one another and compressing the spinal cord. Clumsiness is initially experienced, but without due care, this can progress to quadriplegia or even death.

Vertigo may be associated with rheumatoid arthritis via the following associations that can cause vertigo:
* Ménière&#x27;s disease
* &quot;Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs&quot; This may not happen in the absence of infection.
* Atlanto-axial joint instability can cause symptoms including vertigo and sudden death.
* Atypical Cogan&#x27;s syndrome may be associated with rheumoatoid arthritis.

==== Constitutional symptoms ====
Constitutional symptoms including fatigue, low grade fever, malaise, morning stiffness, loss of appetite and loss of weight are common systemic manifestations seen in people with active RA.

==== Bones ====
Local osteoporosis occurs in RA around inflamed joints. It is postulated to be partially caused by inflammatory cytokines. More general osteoporosis is probably contributed to by immobility, systemic cytokine effects, local cytokine release in bone marrow and corticosteroid therapy.

==== Cancer ====
The incidence of lymphoma is increased, although it is uncommon and associated with the chronic inflammation, not the treatment of RA. The risk of non-melanoma skin cancer is increased in people with RA compared to the general population, an association possibly due to the use of immunosuppression agents for treating RA.

==== Teeth ====
Periodontitis and tooth loss are common in people with rheumatoid arthritis.

== Risk factors ==
RA is a systemic (whole body) autoimmune disease. Some genetic and environmental factors affect the risk for RA.

===Genetic===
Worldwide, RA affects approximately 1% of the adult population and occurs in one in 1,000 children. Studies show that RA primarily affects individuals between the ages of 40–60 years and is seen more commonly in females. A family history of RA increases the risk around three to five times; as of 2016, it was estimated that genetics may account for 40–65% of cases of seropositive RA, but only around 20% for seronegative RA. RA is strongly associated with genes of the inherited tissue type major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen. HLA-DR4 is the major genetic factor implicated – the relative importance varies across ethnic groups.

Genome-wide association studies examining single-nucleotide polymorphisms have found around one hundred alleles associated with RA risk. Risk alleles within the HLA (particularly HLA-DRB1) genes harbor more risk than other loci. The HLA encodes proteins that control recognition of self- versus non-self molecules. Other risk loci include genes affecting co-stimulatory immune pathwaysfor example CD28 and CD40, cytokine signaling, lymphocyte receptor activation threshold (e.g., PTPN22), and innate immune activationappear to have less influence than HLA mutations.

Despite the strong genetic components of the disease, identical twin studies have shown only 12-15% concordance for twins raised in separate households. This indicates that rheumatoid arthritis most likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, in a majority of cases.

===Environmental===
There are established epigenetic and environmental risk factors for RA. Smoking is an established risk factor for RA in Caucasian populations, increasing the risk three times compared to non-smokers, particularly in men, heavy smokers, and those who are rheumatoid factor positive. Modest alcohol consumption may be protective.

Silica exposure has been linked to RA.

===Negative findings===
No infectious agent has been consistently linked with RA and there is no evidence of disease clustering to indicate its infectious cause, but periodontal disease has been consistently associated with RA.

The many negative findings suggest that either the trigger varies, or that it might, in fact, be a chance event inherent with the immune response.

==Pathophysiology==
RA primarily starts as a state of persistent cellular activation leading to autoimmunity and immune complexes in joints and other organs where it manifests.

The clinical manifestations of disease are primarily inflammation of the synovial membrane and joint damage, and the fibroblast-like synoviocytes play a key role in these pathogenic processes. Three phases of progression of RA are an initiation phase (due to non-specific inflammation), an amplification phase (due to T cell activation), and chronic inflammatory phase, with tissue injury resulting from the cytokines, IL–1, TNF-alpha, and IL–6.

===Non-specific inflammation===
Factors allowing an abnormal immune response, once initiated, become permanent and chronic. These factors are genetic disorders which change regulation of the adaptive immune response. Genetic factors interact with environmental risk factors for RA, with cigarette smoking as the most clearly defined risk factor.

Other environmental and hormonal factors may explain higher risks for women, including onset after childbirth and hormonal medications. A possibility for increased susceptibility is that negative feedback mechanisms – which normally maintain tolerance – are overtaken by positive feedback mechanisms for certain antigens, such as IgG Fc bound by rheumatoid factor and citrullinated fibrinogen bound by antibodies to citrullinated peptides (ACPA – Anti–citrullinated protein antibody). A debate on the relative roles of B-cell produced immune complexes and T cell products in inflammation in RA has continued for 30 years, but neither cell is necessary at the site of inflammation, only autoantibodies to IgGFc, known as rheumatoid factors and ACPA, with ACPA having an 80% specificity for diagnosing RA. As with other autoimmune diseases, people with RA have abnormally glycosylated antibodies, which are believed to promote joint inflammation.

===Amplification in the synovium===
Once the generalized abnormal immune response has become established – which may take several years before any symptoms occur – plasma cells derived from B lymphocytes produce rheumatoid factors and ACPA of the IgG and IgM classes in large quantities. These activate macrophages through Fc receptor and complement binding, which is part of the intense inflammation in RA. Binding of an autoreactive antibody to the Fc receptors is mediated through the antibody&#x27;s N-glycans, which are altered to promote inflammation in people with RA.

This contributes to local inflammation in a joint, specifically the synovium with edema, vasodilation and entry of activated T-cells, mainly CD4 in microscopically nodular aggregates and CD8 in microscopically diffuse infiltrates.

Synovial macrophages and dendritic cells function as antigen-presenting cells by expressing MHC class II molecules, which establishes the immune reaction in the tissue.

===Chronic inflammation===

The disease progresses by forming granulation tissue at the edges of the synovial lining, pannus with extensive angiogenesis and enzymes causing tissue damage. The fibroblast-like synoviocytes have a prominent role in these pathogenic processes. The synovium thickens, cartilage and underlying bone disintegrate, and the joint deteriorates, with raised calprotectin levels serving as a biomarker of these events.

Cytokines and chemokines attract and accumulate immune cells, i.e. activated T- and B cells, monocytes and macrophages from activated fibroblast-like synoviocytes, in the joint space. By signalling through RANKL and RANK, they eventually trigger osteoclast production, which degrades bone tissue. The fibroblast-like synoviocytes that are present in the synovium during rheumatoid arthritis display altered phenotype compared to the cells present in normal tissues. The aggressive phenotype of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis and the effect these cells have on the microenvironment of the joint can be summarized into hallmarks that distinguish them from healthy fibroblast-like synoviocytes. These hallmark features of fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis are divided into seven cell-intrinsic hallmarks and four cell-extrinsic hallmarks. The cell-intrinsic hallmarks are: reduced apoptosis, impaired contact inhibition, increased migratory invasive potential, changed epigenetic landscape, temporal and spatial heterogeneity, genomic instability and mutations, and reprogrammed cellular metabolism. The cell-extrinsic hallmarks of FLS in RA are: promotes osteoclastogenesis and bone erosion, contributes to cartilage degradation, induces synovial angiogenesis, and recruits and stimulates immune cells.

==Diagnosis==

===Imaging===

X-rays of the hands and feet are generally performed when many joints affected. In RA, there may be no changes in the early stages of the disease or the x-ray may show osteopenia near the joint, soft tissue swelling, and a smaller than normal joint space. As the disease advances, there may be bony erosions and subluxation. Other medical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound are also used in RA.

Technical advances in ultrasonography like high-frequency transducers (10 MHz or higher) have improved the spatial resolution of ultrasound images depicting 20% more erosions than conventional radiography. Color Doppler and power Doppler ultrasound are useful in assessing the degree of synovial inflammation as they can show vascular signals of active synovitis. This is important, since in the early stages of RA, the synovium is primarily affected, and synovitis seems to be the best predictive marker of future joint damage.

===Blood tests===
When RA is clinically suspected, a physician may test for rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs measured as anti-CCP antibodies).
The test is positive approximately two-thirds of the time, but a negative RF or CCP antibody does not rule out RA; rather, the arthritis is called &quot;seronegative&quot;, which occurs in approximately a third of people with RA. During the first year of illness, rheumatoid factor is more likely to be negative with some individuals becoming seropositive over time. RF is a non-specific antibody and seen in about 10% of healthy people, in many other chronic infections like hepatitis C, and chronic autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Therefore, the test is not specific for RA.

Hence, new serological tests check for anti-citrullinated protein antibodies ACPAs. These tests are again positive in 61–75% of all RA cases, but with a specificity of around 95%. As with RF, ACPAs are many times present before symptoms have started.

The by far most common clinical test for ACPAs is the anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti CCP) ELISA. In 2008 a serological point-of-care test for the early detection of RA combined the detection of RF and anti-MCV with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 99.7%.

To improve the diagnostic capture rate in the early detection of patients with RA and to risk stratify these individuals, the rheumatology field continues to seek complementary markers to both RF and anti-CCP. 14-3-3η (YWHAH) is one such marker that complements RF and anti-CCP, along with other serological measures like C-reactive protein. In a systematic review, 14-3-3η has been described as a welcome addition to the rheumatology field. The authors indicate that the serum based 14-3-η marker is additive to the armamentarium of existing tools available to clinicians, and that there is adequate clinical evidence to support its clinical benefits.

Other blood tests are usually done to differentiate from other causes of arthritis, like the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, full blood count, kidney function, liver enzymes and other immunological tests (e.g., antinuclear antibody/ANA) are all performed at this stage. Elevated ferritin levels can reveal hemochromatosis, a mimic of RA, or be a sign of Still&#x27;s disease, a seronegative, usually juvenile, variant of rheumatoid Arthritis.

===Classification criteria===
In 2010, the &quot;2010 ACR / EULAR Rheumatoid Arthritis Classification Criteria&quot; were introduced.

The new criteria are not diagnostic criteria, but are classification criteria to identify disease with a high likelihood of developing a chronic form. However a score of 6 or greater unequivocally classifies a person with a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis.

These new classification criteria overruled the &quot;old&quot; ACR criteria of 1987 and are adapted for early RA diagnosis. The &quot;new&quot; classification criteria, jointly published by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) establish a point value between 0 and 10. Four areas are covered in the diagnosis:
* joint involvement, designating the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, the interphalangeal joint of the thumb, second through fifth metatarsophalangeal joint and wrist as &quot;small joints&quot;, and shoulders, elbows, hip joints, knees, and ankles as &quot;large joints&quot;:
** Involvement of 1 large joint gives 0 points
** Involvement of 2–10 large joints gives 1 point
** Involvement of 1–3 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints) gives 2 points
** Involvement of 4–10 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints) gives 3 points
** Involvement of more than 10 joints (with involvement of at least 1 small joint) gives 5 points
* serological parameters – including the rheumatoid factor as well as ACPA – &quot;ACPA&quot; stands for &quot;anti-citrullinated protein antibody&quot;:
** Negative RF &quot;and&quot; negative ACPA gives 0 points
** Low-positive RF &quot;or&quot; low-positive ACPA gives 2 points
** High-positive RF &quot;or&quot; high-positive ACPA gives 3 points
* acute phase reactants: 1 point for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ESR, or elevated CRP value (c-reactive protein)
* duration of arthritis: 1 point for symptoms lasting six weeks or longer

The new criteria accommodate to the growing understanding of RA and the improvements in diagnosing RA and disease treatment. In the &quot;new&quot; criteria, serology and autoimmune diagnostics carries major weight, as ACPA detection is appropriate to diagnose the disease in an early state, before joints destructions occur. Destruction of the joints viewed in radiological images was a significant point of the ACR criteria from 1987. This criterion no longer is regarded to be relevant, as this is just the type of damage that treatment is meant to avoid.

===Differential diagnoses===

Several other medical conditions can resemble RA, and need to be distinguished from it at the time of diagnosis:
* Crystal induced arthritis (gout, and pseudogout) – usually involves particular joints (knee, MTP1, heels) and can be distinguished with an aspiration of joint fluid if in doubt. Redness, asymmetric distribution of affected joints, pain occurs at night and the starting pain is less than an hour with gout.
* Osteoarthritis – distinguished with X-rays of the affected joints and blood tests, older age, starting pain less than an hour, asymmetric distribution of affected joints and pain worsens when using joint for longer periods.
* Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) – distinguished by specific clinical symptoms and blood tests (antibodies against double-stranded DNA)
* One of the several types of psoriatic arthritis resembles RA – nail changes and skin symptoms distinguish between them
* Lyme disease causes erosive arthritis and may closely resemble RA – it may be distinguished by blood test in endemic areas
* Reactive arthritis – asymmetrically involves heel, sacroiliac joints and large joints of the leg. It is usually associated with urethritis, conjunctivitis, iritis, painless buccal ulcers, and keratoderma blennorrhagica.
* Axial spondyloarthritis (including ankylosing spondylitis) – this involves the spine, although an RA-like symmetrical small-joint polyarthritis may occur in the context of this condition.
* Hepatitis C – RA-like symmetrical small-joint polyarthritis may occur in the context of this condition. Hepatitis C may also induce rheumatoid factor auto-antibodies.

Rarer causes which usually behave differently but may cause joint pains:
* Sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and Whipple&#x27;s disease can also resemble RA.
* Hemochromatosis may cause hand joint arthritis.
* Acute rheumatic fever can be differentiated by a migratory pattern of joint involvement and evidence of antecedent streptococcal infection.
* Bacterial arthritis (such as by &quot;Streptococcus&quot;) is usually asymmetric, while RA usually involves both sides of the body symmetrically.
* Gonococcal arthritis (a bacterial arthritis) is also initially migratory and can involve tendons around the wrists and ankles.

Sometimes arthritis is in an undifferentiated stage (i.e. none of the above criteria is positive), even if synovitis is witnessed and assessed with ultrasound imaging.

=== Difficult-to-treat ===
Rheumatoid arthritis (D2T RA) is a specific classification RA by the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR).

Signs of illness:

# Persistence of signs and symptoms
# Drug resistance
# Does not respond on two or more biological treatments
# Does not respond on anti-rheumatic drugs with different mechanism of action

Factors contributing to difficult-to-treat disease:

# Genetic risk factors
# Environmental factors (diet, smoking, physical activity)
# Overweight and obese

===Genetic factors===

Genetic factors such as HLA-DR1B1, TRAF1, PSORS1C1 and microRNA 146a are associated with difficult to treat rheumatoid arthritis, other gene polymorphisms seem to be correlated with response to biologic modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). Next one is FOXO3A gene region been reported as associated with worst disorder. The minor allele at FOXO3A summon a differential response of monocytes in RA patients. FOXO3A can provide an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNFα. Possible gene polymorphism: STAT4, PTPN2, PSORS1C1 and TRAF3IP2 genes had been correlated with response to TNF inhibitors.

===HLA-DR1 and HLA-DRB1 gene===

The &quot;HLA&quot;-&quot;DRB1&quot; gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Currently, have been identified at least 2479 different versions of the &quot;HLA&quot;-&quot;DRB1&quot; gene. The presence of HLA-DRB1 alleles seems to predict radiographic damage, which may be partially mediated by ACPA development, and also elevated sera inflammatory levels and high swollen joint count. HLA-DR1 is encoded by the most risk allele HLA-DRB1 which share a conserved 5-aminoacid sequence that is correlated with the development of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies. HLA-DRB1 gene have more strong correlation with disease development. Susceptibility to and outcome for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may associate with particular HLA-DR alleles, but these alleles vary among ethnic groups and geographic areas.

===MicroRNAs===

MicroRNAs are a factor in the development of that type of disease. MicroRNAs usually operate as a negative regulator of the expression of target proteins and their increased concentration after biologic treatment (bDMARDs) or after anti-rheumatic drugs. Level of miRNA before and after anti-TNFa/DMRADs combination therapy are potential novel biomarkers for predicting and monitoring outcome. For instance, some of them were found significantly upregulated by anti-TNFa/DMRADs combination therapy. For example, miRNA-16-5p, miRNA-23-3p, miRNA125b-5p, miRNA-126-3p, miRNA-146a-5p, miRNA-223-3p. Curious fact is that only responder patients showed an increase in those miRNAs after therapy, and paralleled the reduction of TNFα, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, rheumatoid factor (RF), and C-reactive protein (CRP).

===Monitoring progression===

Many tools can be used to monitor remission in rheumatoid arthritis.
* DAS28: &quot;Disease Activity Score of 28 joints&quot; () is widely used as an indicator of RA disease activity and response to treatment. Joints included are (bilaterally): proximal interphalangeal joints (10 joints), metacarpophalangeal joints (10), wrists (2), elbows (2), shoulders (2) and knees (2). When looking at these joints, both the number of joints with tenderness upon touching (TEN28) and swelling (SW28) are counted. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is measured and the affected person makes a subjective assessment (SA) of disease activity during the preceding 7 days on a scale between 0 and 100, where 0 is &quot;no activity&quot; and 100 is &quot;highest activity possible&quot;. With these parameters, DAS28 is calculated as:
formula_1

From this, the disease activity of the affected person can be classified as follows:
It is not always a reliable indicator of treatment effect. One major limitation is that low-grade synovitis may be missed.
* Other: Other tools to monitor remission in rheumatoid arthritis are: ACR-EULAR Provisional Definition of Remission of Rheumatoid arthritis, Simplified Disease Activity Index and Clinical Disease Activity Index. Some scores do not require input from a healthcare professional and allow self-monitoring by the person, like HAQ-DI.

==Management==
There is no cure for RA, but treatments can improve symptoms and slow the progress of the disease. Disease-modifying treatment has the best results when it is started early and aggressively. The results of a recent systematic review found that combination therapy with tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and non-TNF biologics plus methotrexate (MTX) resulted in improved disease control, Disease Activity Score (DAS)-defined remission, and functional capacity compared with a single treatment of either methotrexate or a biologic alone.

The goals of treatment are to minimize symptoms such as pain and swelling, to prevent bone deformity (for example, bone erosions visible in X-rays), and to maintain day-to-day functioning. This is primarily addressed with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs); dosed physical activity; analgesics and physical therapy may be used to help manage pain. RA should generally be treated with at least one specific anti-rheumatic medication while combination therapies and corticosteroids are common in treatment. The use of benzodiazepines (such as diazepam) to treat the pain is not recommended as it does not appear to help and is associated with risks.

===Lifestyle===
Regular exercise is recommended as both safe and useful to maintain muscle strength and overall physical function. Physical activity is beneficial for people with rheumatoid arthritis who experience fatigue, although there was little to no evidence to suggest that exercise may have an impact on physical function in the long term, a study found that carefully dosed exercise has shown significant improvements in patients with RA. Physical activity increases the production of synovial fluid, which lubricates the joints and reduces friction. Moderate effects have been found for aerobic exercises and resistance training on cardiovascular fitness and muscle strength in RA. Furthermore, physical activity had no detrimental side effects like increased disease activity in any exercise dimension. It is uncertain if eating or avoiding specific foods or other specific dietary measures help improve symptoms, but several studies have shown that high-vegetable diets improve RA symptoms whereas high-meat diets make symptoms worse. Occupational therapy has a positive role to play in improving functional ability in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Weak evidence supports the use of wax baths (thermotherapy) to treat arthritis in the hands.

Educational approaches that inform people about tools and strategies available to help them cope with rheumatoid arthritis may improve a person&#x27;s psychological status and level of depression in the shorter-term. Educating patients who have rheumatoid arthritis has shown a positive effect on how patients engage in their plan of care; the patient will be aware of fatigue, activity limitations, and pain and know possible side effects of how to manage this pain. Lack of knowledge can often lead to fear and limit adherence. Intervention by physical therapists plays a key role in offering proper tools for self-management, motivation in activities of daily living, and any assistive device use if needed. Patients will be assisted in managing neurologic impairments and musculoskeletal stiffness to maximize strength and function. Encouraging patients to balance physical activity with their everyday living can prevent further joint damage and provide a sense of control.

The use of extra-depth shoes and molded insoles may reduce pain during weight-bearing activities such as walking. Insoles may also prevent the progression of bunions.

===Disease-modifying agents===
Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are the primary treatment for RA. They are a diverse collection of drugs, grouped by use and convention. They have been found to improve symptoms, decrease joint damage, and improve overall functional abilities. DMARDs should be started early in the disease as they result in disease remission in approximately half of people and improved outcomes overall.

The following drugs are considered DMARDs: methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, TNF inhibitors (certolizumab, adalimumab, infliximab and etanercept), abatacept, anakinra, and auranofin. Additionally, rituximab and tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies and are also DMARDs. Use of tocilizumab is associated with a risk of increased cholesterol levels.

The most commonly used agent is methotrexate with other frequently used agents including sulfasalazine and leflunomide. Leflunomide is effective when used from 6–12 months, with similar effectiveness to methotrexate when used for 2 years. Sulfasalazine also appears to be most effective in the short-term treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.

Hydroxychloroquine, in addition to its low toxicity profile, is considered effective for treatment of moderate RA symptoms.

Agents may be used in combination, however, people may experience greater side effects. Methotrexate is the most important and useful DMARD and is usually the first treatment. A combined approach with methotrexate and biologics improves ACR50, HAQ scores and RA remission rates. This benefit from the combination of methotrexate with biologics occurs both when this combination is the initial treatment and when drugs are prescribed in a sequential or step-up manner. Triple therapy consisting of methotrexate, sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine may also effectively control disease activity. Adverse effects should be monitored regularly with toxicity including gastrointestinal, hematologic, pulmonary, and hepatic. Side effects such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain can be reduced by taking folic acid.

Rituximab combined with methotrexate appears to be more effective in improving symptoms compared to methotrexate alone. Rituximab works by decreasing levels of B-cells (immune cell that is involved in inflammation). People taking rituximab had improved pain, function, reduced disease activity and reduced joint damage based on x-ray images. After 6 months, 21% more people had improvement in their symptoms using rituximab and methotrexate.

Biological agents should generally be used only if methotrexate and other conventional agents are not effective after a trial of three months. They are associated with a higher rate of serious infections as compared to other DMARDs. Biological DMARD agents used to treat rheumatoid arthritis include: tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitors (TNF inhibitors) such as infliximab; interleukin 1 blockers such as anakinra, monoclonal antibodies against B cells such as rituximab, interleukin 6 blockers such as tocilizumab, and T cell co-stimulation blockers such as abatacept. They are often used in combination with either methotrexate or leflunomide. Biologic monotherapy or tofacitinib with methotrexate may improve ACR50, RA remission rates and function. Abatacept should not be used at the same time as other biologics. In those who are well controlled (low disease activity) on TNF inhibitors, decreasing the dose does not appear to affect overall function. Discontinuation of TNF inhibitors (as opposed to gradually lowering the dose) by people with low disease activity may lead to increased disease activity and may affect remission, damage that is visible on an x-ray, and a person&#x27;s function. People should be screened for latent tuberculosis before starting any TNF inhibitor therapy to avoid reactivation of tuberculosis.

TNF inhibitors and methotrexate appear to have similar effectiveness when used alone and better results are obtained when used together. Golimumab is effective when used with methotraxate. TNF inhibitors may have equivalent effectiveness with etanercept appearing to be the safest. Injecting etanercept, in addition to methotrexate twice a week may improve ACR50 and decrease radiographic progression for up to 3 years. Abatacept appears effective for RA with 20% more people improving with treatment than without but long term safety studies are yet unavailable. Adalimumab slows the time for the radiographic progression when used for 52 weeks. However, there is a lack of evidence to distinguish between the biologics available for RA. Issues with the biologics include their high cost and association with infections including tuberculosis. Use of biological agents may reduce fatigue. The mechanism of how biologics reduce fatigue is unclear.

====Gold and cyclosporin====

Sodium aurothiomalate, auranofin, and cyclosporin are less commonly used due to more common adverse effects. However, cyclosporin was found to be effective in the progressive RA when used up to one year.

====Hydrogen Therapy====
Patients with RA given H2-water (hydrogen therapy for four weeks showed significant improvement of symptoms.

===Anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents===
Glucocorticoids can be used in the short term and at the lowest dose possible for flare-ups and while waiting for slow-onset drugs to take effect. Combination of glucocorticoids and conventional therapy has shown a decrease in rate of erosion of bones. Steroids may be injected into affected joints during the initial period of RA, prior to the use of DMARDs or oral steroids.

Non-NSAID drugs to relieve pain, like paracetamol may be used to help relieve the pain symptoms; they do not change the underlying disease. The use of paracetamol may be associated with the risk of developing ulcers.

NSAIDs reduce both pain and stiffness in those with RA but do not affect the underlying disease and appear to have no effect on people&#x27;s long term disease course and thus are no longer first line agents. NSAIDs should be used with caution in those with gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, or kidney problems. Rofecoxib was withdrawn from the global market as its long-term use was associated to an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes. Use of methotrexate together with NSAIDs is safe, if adequate monitoring is done. COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib, and NSAIDs are equally effective. A 2004 Cochrane review found that people preferred NSAIDs over paracetamol. However, it is yet to be clinically determined whether NSAIDs are more effective than paracetamol.

The neuromodulator agents topical capsaicin may be reasonable to use in an attempt to reduce pain. Nefopam by mouth and cannabis are not recommended as of 2012 as the risks of use appear to be greater than the benefits.

Limited evidence suggests the use of weak oral opioids but the adverse effects may outweigh the benefits.

Alternatively, physical therapy has been tested and shown as an effective aid in reducing pain in patients with RA. As most RA is detected early and treated aggressively, physical therapy plays more of a preventative and compensatory role, aiding in pain management alongside regular rheumatic therapy.

===Surgery===
Especially for affected fingers, hands, and wrists, synovectomy may be needed to prevent pain or tendon rupture when drug treatment has failed. Severely affected joints may require joint replacement surgery, such as knee replacement. Postoperatively, physiotherapy is always necessary. There is insufficient evidence to support surgical treatment on arthritic shoulders.

=== Physiotherapy ===
For people with RA, physiotherapy may be used together with medical management. This may include cold and heat application, electronic stimulation, and hydrotherapy. Although medications improve symptoms of RA, muscle function is not regained when disease activity is controlled.

Physiotherapy promotes physical activity. In RA, physical activity like exercise in the appropriate dosage (frequency, intensity, time, type, volume, progression) and physical activity promotion is effective in improving cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength, and maintaining a long term active lifestyle. Additionally, exercise can be useful for pain management in this population, specifically, conditioning exercise programs that include aerobic, isometric, and isotonic exercises. Due to the debilitating effects of the disease, people with RA can gain skills back through exercise because it increases the energy capacity of the muscles. In the short term, resistance exercises, with or without range of motion exercises, improve self-reported hand functions. Physical activity promotion according to the public health recommendations should be an integral part of standard care for people with RA and other arthritic diseases. Additionally, the combination of physical activities and cryotherapy show its efficacy on the disease activity and pain relief. The combination of aerobic activity and cryotherapy may be an innovative therapeutic strategy to improve the aerobic capacity in arthritis patients and consequently reduce their cardiovascular risk while minimizing pain and disease activity.

=== Compression gloves ===
Compression gloves are handwear designed to help prevent the occurrence of various medical disorders relating to blood circulation in the wrists and hands. They can be used to treat the symptoms of arthritis, though the medical benefits may be limited.

===Alternative medicine===
In general, there is not enough evidence to support any complementary health approaches for RA, with safety concerns for some of them. Some mind and body practices and dietary supplements may help people with symptoms and therefore may be beneficial additions to conventional treatments, but there is not enough evidence to draw conclusions. A systematic review of CAM modalities (excluding fish oil) found that &quot; The available evidence does not support their current use in the management of RA.&quot; Studies showing beneficial effects in RA on a wide variety of CAM modalities are often affected by publication bias and are generally not high quality evidence such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

A 2005 Cochrane review states that low level laser therapy can be tried to improve pain and morning stiffness due to rheumatoid arthritis as there are few side-effects.

There is limited evidence that tai chi might improve the range of motion of a joint in persons with rheumatoid arthritis. The evidence for acupuncture is inconclusive with it appearing to be equivalent to sham acupuncture.

A Cochrane review in 2002 showed some benefits of the electrical stimulation as a rehabilitation intervention to improve the power of the hand grip and help to resist fatigue. D‐penicillamine may provide similar benefits as DMARDs but it is also highly toxic. Low-quality evidence suggests the use of therapeutic ultrasound on arthritic hands. Potential benefits include increased grip strength, reduced morning stiffness and number of swollen joints. There is tentative evidence of benefit of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) in RA. Acupuncture‐like TENS (AL-TENS) may decrease pain intensity and improve muscle power scores.

Low-quality evidence suggests people with active RA may benefit from assistive technology. This may include less discomfort and difficulty such as when using an eye drop device. Balance training is of unclear benefits.

===Dietary supplements===

====Fatty acids====
There has been a growing interest in the role of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids to reduce inflammation and alleviate the symptoms of RA. Metabolism of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids produces docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which inhibits pro-inflammatory eicosanoids and cytokines (TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6), decreasing both lymphocyte proliferation and reactive oxygen species. These studies showed evidence for significant clinical improvements on RA in inflammatory status and articular index. Gamma-linolenic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, may reduce pain, tender joint count and stiffness, and is generally safe. For omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (found in fish oil, flax oil and hemp oil), a meta-analysis reported a favorable effect on pain, although confidence in the effect was considered moderate. The same review reported less inflammation but no difference in joint function. A review examined the effect of marine oil omega-3 fatty acids on pro-inflammatory eicosanoid concentrations; leukotriene4 (LTB4) was lowered in people with rheumatoid arthritis but not in those with non-autoimmune chronic diseases. Fish consumption has no association with RA. A fourth review limited inclusion to trials in which people eat ≥2.7 g/day for more than three months. Use of pain relief medication was decreased, but improvements in tender or swollen joints, morning stiffness and physical function were not changed. Collectively, the current evidence is not strong enough to determine that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids or regular consumption of fish are effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis.

====Herbal====
The American College of Rheumatology states that no herbal medicines have health claims supported by high-quality evidence and thus they do not recommend their use. There is no scientific basis to suggest that herbal supplements advertised as &quot;natural&quot; are safer for use than conventional medications as both are chemicals. Herbal medications, although labelled &quot;natural&quot;, may be toxic or fatal if consumed. Due to the false belief that herbal supplements are always safe, there is sometimes a hesitancy to report their use which may increase the risk of adverse reactions.

===Pregnancy===
More than 75% of women with rheumatoid arthritis have symptoms improve during pregnancy but might have symptoms worsen after delivery. Methotrexate and leflunomide are teratogenic (harmful to foetus) and not used in pregnancy. It is recommended women of childbearing age should use contraceptives to avoid pregnancy and to discontinue its use if pregnancy is planned. Low dose of prednisolone, hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine are considered safe in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis. Prednisolone should be used with caution as the side effects include infections and fractures.

===Vaccinations===
People with RA have an increased risk of infections and mortality and recommended vaccinations can reduce these risks. The inactivated influenza vaccine should be received annually. The pneumococcal vaccine should be administered twice for people under the age 65 and once for those over 65. Lastly, the live-attenuated zoster vaccine should be administered once after the age 60, but is not recommended in people on a tumor necrosis factor alpha blocker.

==Prognosis==

The course of the disease varies greatly. Some people have mild short-term symptoms, but in most the disease is progressive for life. Around 25% will have subcutaneous nodules (known as rheumatoid nodules); this is associated with a poor prognosis.

===Prognostic factors===
Poor prognostic factors include,
* Persistent synovitis
* Early erosive disease
* Extra-articular findings (including subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules)
* Positive serum RF findings
* Positive serum anti-CCP autoantibodies
* Positive serum 14-3-3η (YWHAH) levels above 0.5 ng/ml 
* Carriership of HLA-DR4 &quot;Shared Epitope&quot; alleles
* Family history of RA
* Poor functional status
* Socioeconomic factors
* Elevated acute phase response (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR], C-reactive protein [CRP])
* Increased clinical severity.
* Distance from primary care and specialist care in rural communities

===Mortality===
RA reduces lifespan on average from three to twelve years. Young age at onset, long disease duration, the presence of other health problems, and characteristics of severe RAsuch as poor functional ability or overall health status, a lot of joint damage on x-rays, the need for hospitalisation or involvement of organs other than the jointshave been shown to associate with higher mortality. Positive responses to treatment may indicate a better prognosis. A 2005 study by the Mayo Clinic noted that individuals with RA have a doubled risk of heart disease, independent of other risk factors such as diabetes, excessive alcohol use, and elevated cholesterol, blood pressure and body mass index. The mechanism by which RA causes this increased risk remains unknown; the presence of chronic inflammation has been proposed as a contributing factor. It is possible that the use of new biologic drug therapies extend the lifespan of people with RA and reduce the risk and progression of atherosclerosis. This is based on cohort and registry studies, and still remains hypothetical. It is still uncertain whether biologics improve vascular function in RA or not. There was an increase in total cholesterol and HDLc levels and no improvement of the atherogenic index.&lt;ref name=&quot;biologics cv effects/ cancer&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
RA affects 0.5–1% of adults in the developed world with between 5 and 50 per 100,000 people newly developing the condition each year. In 2010 it resulted in about 49,000 deaths globally.

Onset is uncommon under the age of 15 and from then on the incidence rises with age until the age of 80. Women are affected three to five times as often as men.

The age at which the disease most commonly starts is in women between 40 and 50 years of age, and for men somewhat later. RA is a chronic disease, and although rarely, a spontaneous remission may occur, the common course of progression consists of persistent symptoms that wax and wane in intensity, along with continued deterioration of joint structures, leading to deformation and disability.

There is an association between periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), hypothesised to lead to enhanced generation of RA-related autoantibodies. Oral bacteria that invade the blood may also contribute to chronic inflammatory responses and generation of autoantibodies.

==History==
The first recognized description of RA in modern medicine was in 1800 by the French physician Augustin Jacob Landré-Beauvais (1772–1840) who was based in the famed Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris. The name &quot;rheumatoid arthritis&quot; itself was coined in 1859 by British rheumatologist Alfred Baring Garrod.

The art of Peter Paul Rubens may possibly depict the effects of RA. In his later paintings, his rendered hands show, in the opinion of some physicians, increasing deformity consistent with the symptoms of the disease. RA appears to some to have been depicted in 16th-century paintings. However, it is generally recognized in art historical circles that the painting of hands in the 16th and 17th century followed certain stylized conventions, most clearly seen in the Mannerist movement. It was conventional, for instance, to show the upheld right hand of Christ in what now appears a deformed posture. These conventions are easily misinterpreted as portrayals of disease.

Historic (though not necessarily effective) treatments for RA have also included: rest, ice, compression and elevation, apple diet, nutmeg, some light exercise every now and then, nettles, bee venom, copper bracelets, rhubarb diet, extractions of teeth, fasting, honey, vitamins, insulin, magnets, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).

===Etymology===
Rheumatoid arthritis is derived from the Greek word &quot;ῥεύμα-rheuma (nom.), ῥεύματος-rheumatos (gen.)&quot; (&quot;flow, current&quot;). The suffix -&quot;oid&quot; (&quot;resembling&quot;) gives the translation as &quot;joint inflammation that resembles rheumatic fever&quot;. Rhuma which means watery discharge might refer to the fact that the joints are swollen or that the disease may be made worse by wet weather.

==Research==

Meta-analysis found an association between periodontal disease and RA, but the mechanism of this association remains unclear. Two bacterial species associated with periodontitis are implicated as mediators of protein citrullination in the gums of people with RA.

Vitamin D deficiency is more common in people with rheumatoid arthritis than in the general population. However, whether vitamin D deficiency is a cause or a consequence of the disease remains unclear. One meta-analysis found that vitamin D levels are low in people with rheumatoid arthritis and that vitamin D status correlates inversely with prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis, suggesting that vitamin D deficiency is associated with susceptibility to rheumatoid arthritis.

The fibroblast-like synoviocytes have a prominent role in the pathogenic processes of the rheumatic joints, and therapies that target these cells are emerging as promising therapeutic tools, raising hope for future applications in rheumatoid arthritis.

Possible links with intestinal barrier dysfunction are investigated.

<text>Anastasius I Dicorus (; – 9 July 518) was Eastern Roman emperor from 491 to 518. A career civil servant, he came to the throne at the age of 61 after being chosen by Ariadne, the wife of his predecessor, Zeno. His reign was characterized by reforms and improvements in the empire&#x27;s government, finances, economy and bureaucracy. The resulting stable government, reinvigorated monetary economy and sizeable budget surplus allowed the empire to pursue more ambitious policies under his successors, most notably Justinian I. Since many of Anastasius&#x27; reforms proved long-lasting, his influence over the empire endured for centuries.

Anastasius was a Miaphysite Christian and his personal religious tendencies caused tensions throughout his reign in the empire that was becoming increasingly divided along religious lines.

==Early life and family==

Anastasius was born at Dyrrachium; the date is unknown, but is thought to have been no later than 431. He was born into an Illyro-Roman family. Anastasius had one black eye and one blue eye (heterochromia), and for that reason he was nicknamed &quot;Dicorus&quot; (, &quot;two-pupiled&quot;). Before becoming emperor, Anastasius was a silentiary.

Anastasius is known to have had a brother named Paulus, who served as consul in 496. With a woman known as Magna, Paulus was father to Irene, who married Olybrius. This Olybrius was the son of Anicia Juliana and Areobindus Dagalaifus Areobindus. The daughter of Olybrius and Irene was named Proba. She married Probus and was mother to a younger Juliana. This younger Juliana married another Anastasius, maternal grandson of Theodora, and was mother of Areobindus, Placidia, and a younger Proba, who married Flavius Anastasius, born in 530, and mothered Areobindus, born in 550, and Placidia, born in 552 and wife of John Mystacon. Another nephew of Anastasius was Flavius Probus, consul in 502. Anastasius&#x27; sister, Caesaria, married Secundinus, and gave birth to Hypatius and Pompeius. Flavius Anastasius Paulus Probus Moschianus Probus Magnus, consul in 518, was a great-nephew of Anastasius. His daughter Juliana later married Marcellus, a brother of Justin II. The extensive family may well have included several viable candidates for the throne.

== Accession ==

Following the death of Zeno (491), there is strong evidence that many Roman citizens wanted an emperor who was a Chalcedonian Christian and a Roman proper. In the weeks following Zeno&#x27;s death, crowds gathered in Constantinople chanting &quot;Give the Empire an Orthodox emperor!&quot; Under such pressure, Ariadne, Zeno&#x27;s widow, turned to Anastasius. Anastasius was in his sixties at the time of his ascension to the throne. It is noteworthy that Ariadne chose Anastasius over Zeno&#x27;s brother Longinus, who was arguably the more logical choice; this upset the Isaurians. It was also not appreciated by the circus factions, the Blues and the Greens. These groups combined aspects of street gangs and political parties and had been patronised by Longinus. After Anastasius took the throne they rioted repeatedly, causing serious damage and loss of life. Religiously, Anastasius&#x27; sympathies were with the Monophysites. Consequently, as a condition of his rule, the patriarch of Constantinople required that he pledge not to repudiate the Council of Chalcedon.

Ariadne married Anastasius on 20 May 491, shortly after his accession on 11 April. He gained popular favour by a judicious remission of taxation, in particular by abolishing the hated tax on receipts, which was mostly paid by the poor. He displayed great vigour and energy in administering the affairs of the empire. His reforms improved the empire&#x27;s tax base and pulled it from financial depression and bleak morale. By the end of his reign, it is claimed that the treasury had 320,000 lb gold reserve.

== Foreign policy and wars ==

Under Anastasius, the empire engaged in the Isaurian War against the usurper Longinus and the Anastasian War against Sassanid Persia.

The Isaurian War (492–497) was stirred up by the Isaurian supporters of Longinus, the brother of Zeno, who was passed over for the throne in favour of Anastasius. The Battle of Cotyaeum in 492 broke the back of the revolt, but guerrilla warfare continued in the Isaurian Mountains for several years. The resistance in the mountains hinged upon the Isaurians&#x27; retention of Papirius Castle. The war lasted five years, but Anastasius passed legislation related to the economy in the mid-490s, which suggests that the war did not absorb all of the energy and resources of the government. After five years, the Isaurian resistance was broken. Large numbers of Isaurians were forcibly relocated to Thrace to ensure that they would not revolt again.

During the Anastasian War of 502–505 against the Sassanid Persians, the Sassanids captured the cities of Theodosiopolis and Amida, although the Romans later received Amida in exchange for gold. The Persian provinces also suffered severely, and a peace was concluded in 506. Anastasius afterward built the strong fortress of Daras, which was named Anastasiopolis, to hold the Persians at Nisibis in check. The Balkan provinces were denuded of troops, however, and were devastated by invasions of Slavs and Bulgars. To protect Constantinople and its vicinity against them, Anastasius built the Anastasian Wall, extending from the Propontis to the Black Sea. He converted his birthplace, Dyrrachium, into one of the most fortified cities on the Adriatic with the construction of Durrës Castle.

Once the relationship with the Ostrogoths was restored, the Praetorian prefecture of Italy was governed by the Ostrogothic ruler Theodoric, but under the conditions agreed with Anastasius, Theodoric could not make laws, mint his coins nor appoint Goths to the consulship and civil offices. However, he had the right to promulgate edicts, appoint Romans to the consulship and civil offices, and hold military authority over the prefecture. Theodoric forged a relationship with the Visigothic king Alaric II in Gaul. Anastasius became wary of Theodoric&#x27;s imperial ambition in the West. In the Frankish &quot;rex&quot; Clovis, the emperor found an ally. Partly thanks to the former &quot;magister militum&quot; Gundobad, he teamed up with Clovis to overthrow the Gothic hegemony in the West. In the Franco–Gothic War (507–511), Clovis defeated the Visigoths at the Battle of Vouillé. The threat of an invasion by the Roman army had prevented Theodoric from intervening in the battle on time to support the Visigoths in 507. In early 508, a Roman attack actually took place in the Italian boot. Anastasius had sent an expedition force of 8,000 soldiers for this attack, but the Roman intervention was not aimed at conquest, since it did not seek a confrontation with Theodoric&#x27;s army and limited itself only to the looting of some cities in the south. The Franks were thus more successful in the war.

== Domestic and ecclesiastical policies ==

Anastasius was a convinced Monophysite, but his ecclesiastical policy was moderate. He endeavoured to maintain the principle of the Henotikon of Zeno and the peace of the church. Yet, in 512, perhaps emboldened after his military success against the Persians, Anastasius deposed the Metropolitan of Chalcedon and replaced him with a Monophysite. That violated his agreement with the Patriarch of Constantinople and precipitated riots in Chalcedon. The following year, the general Vitalian started a rebellion, quickly defeated an imperial army and marched on Constantinople. With the army closing in, Anastasius gave Vitalian the title of Commander of the Army of Thrace and began communicating with the Pope on a potential end to the Acacian schism. Two years later, General Marinus attacked Vitalian and forced him and his troops to the northern part of Thrace. After the conclusion of the conflict, Anastasius had undisputed control of the empire until his death in 518.

== Successor ==

The &quot;Anonymous Valesianus&quot; gives a (most likely fictional) account of Anastasius attempting to predict his successor. Anastasius did not know which of his three nephews would succeed him and so he put a message under one of three couches and had his nephews take seats in the room. He believed that the nephew who sat on the couch with the message would be his heir. However, two of his nephews sat on the same couch, and the one with the concealed message remained empty. After putting the matter to God in prayer, he determined that the first person to enter his room the next morning would be the next emperor, and that person turned out to be Justin, the commander of the Excubitors (&quot;comes excubitorum&quot;).

Anastasius died childless in Constantinople on 9 July 518. He was 90 and a half years old according to the later chronicles of John Malalas ( 491–578) and the &quot;Chronicon Paschale&quot; ( 630). The early 6th-century historian Victor of Tunnuna states that he died at the age of 88, a figure accepted by most modern historians.

He became the last emperor known to be consecrated as divus on his death. Anastasius left the Imperial treasury with 23,000,000 &quot;solidi&quot;, which is 320,000 pounds of gold or . Justin then became the next emperor.

==Administrative reform and introduction of new coinage==

Anastasius is famous for showing an uncommon interest in administrative efficiency and issues concerning the economy. Whenever it was possible in governmental transactions, he altered the method of payment from goods to hard currency. This practice decreased the potential for embezzlement and the need for transportation and storage of supplies. It also allowed for easier accounting. He also applied this practice to taxes, mandating that taxes be paid with cash rather than with goods. He eliminated the practice of providing soldiers with their arms and uniforms; instead he allotted each soldier a generous sum of money with which to purchase their own. These changes to imperial policy seem to have worked well; taxpayers often paid smaller tax bills than they had before, while government revenue increased. The increase in revenue allowed the emperor to pay soldiers a higher wage, which attracted native Roman soldiers to the military, as opposed to the barbarian and Isaurian mercenaries which some previous emperors had been forced to rely on. Anastasius is often cited for his &quot;prudent management&quot; of the empire&#x27;s finances.

Amidst these reforms, though, Anastasius continued the practice of selling official positions. He sold so many that he has been accused of having facilitated the creation of a civilian aristocracy. This claim is strengthened by the growth in influence of families that often held high level positions in the government, such as the Apiones from Egypt. This has puzzled historians, given that the emperor seems to have minimised government corruption/inefficiency in other areas. Anastasius I also gave official positions to his close friend General Celer, his brother-in-law, his brother, his nephews, and his grand-nephews.

The complex monetary system of the early Byzantine Empire, which suffered a partial collapse in the mid-5th century, was revived by Anastasius in 498. The new system involved three denominations of gold, the &quot;solidus&quot; and its half (&quot;semissis&quot;) and third (&quot;tremissis&quot;); and five denominations of copper, the &quot;follis&quot; (worth 40 &quot;nummi&quot;) and its fractions down to a &quot;nummus&quot;. It would seem that the new currency quickly became an important part of trade with other regions. A follis coin has been found in the Charjou desert, north of the River Oxus. Four solidi from his reign have been recovered as far from the Roman Empire as China. China might seem an unlikely trading partner, but the Romans and the Chinese were probably able to do business via Central Asian merchants travelling along the Silk Roads. Some Roman trading partners attempted to replicate the coins of Anastasius. The currency created by Anastasius stayed in use and circulated widely for long after his reign.

A 40-&quot;nummi&quot; coin of Anastasius is depicted on the obverse of North Macedonia&#x27;s 50 denar banknote, issued in 1996.

<text>Artemius Anastasius (; died 719), known as Anastasius II, was the Byzantine emperor from 713 to 715. His reign was marked by significant religious and political decisions aimed at stabilizing the Empire. One of his notable actions was reversing the previous appointment of a Monothelete patriarch of Constantinople, instead reinstating Orthodoxy by appointing Germanus I to the position. This move was made in an effort to gain the favor of Pope Constantine.

Anastasius II dedicated his efforts to fortifying the Empire and fostering a period of stability. However, his reign was cut short when he was deposed by Theodosius III during the Byzantine campaign against the Umayyad Caliphate in 715. Undeterred, four years later, in 719, Anastasius launched a rebellion against Leo III the Isaurian in a bid to reclaim the imperial throne.

Initially, Anastasius received support from Tervel of Bulgaria, who provided soldiers and funds for his cause. However, the situation took a turn when Anastasius failed to enter Constantinople, and the Bulgarian forces he had brought with him complied with a request from Leo III to hand over Anastasius and his allies. Consequently, Anastasius was executed alongside other members of the rebellion in 719.

==Biography==
Anastasius, originally named Artemios (; male form of Artemis) held prominent positions as a bureaucrat and Imperial secretary (&quot;asekretis&quot;) under preceding emperors. His tenure coincided with a period of turmoil and instability in the Byzantine Empire known as The Twenty Years&#x27; Anarchy. Following the initial removal of the last hereditary ruler, Justinian II, the empire experienced a rapid succession of four rulers from 695 to 713. The fourth ruler, Philippicus, successfully deposed Justinian II for the second time.

Philippicus adopted policies that proved unfavorable to the majority of the empire&#x27;s population, who adhered to Orthodoxy. Notably, he deposed the Orthodox patriarch of Constantinople in favor of a Monothelete patriarch. This decision garnered significant opposition both within the empire, particularly among the Orthodox populace, and from the church in Rome. Additionally, Philippicus diverted military resources from Anatolia to the Balkans in an attempt to defend Constantinople against the Bulgars. However, this shift left the empire&#x27;s eastern front vulnerable to the Umayyad Caliphate&#x27;s advancements. Consequently, Philippicus faced widespread discontent during his reign. All these things caused Philippicus’ reign to be plagued with discontent among the populace.

In 713, the troops belonging to the Opsikion &quot;Theme&quot; stationed in Thrace rose up against Emperor Philippicus. To prevent him from leading a counter-rebellion and due to the traditional requirement of physical flawlessness for an emperor, Philippicus was blinded. This act aimed to disqualify him both culturally and practically from ever reclaiming the throne. The day after the blinding, the conspirators selected Artemios as the new emperor, who subsequently adopted the regnal name Anastasius. Like his predecessor, Anastasius ascended the throne under similar circumstances, which also posed the possibility of a comparable downfall.

To consolidate this position and maintain stability within the military, crucial for thwarting future coups and retaining Imperial control, Anastasius took decisive measures. He had the officers directly responsible for plotting against Philippicus blinded and exiled. This action served as a deterrent against future rebellions, ensuring that Anastasius could maintain his rule and prevent further unrest.

=== Rule ===

During Anastasius&#x27; reign, his primary focus was on stabilizing the Byzantine Empire. One of his key objectives was to reverse the religious reforms implemented by his predecessor. In line with this goal, Anastasius supported the decisions of the Sixth Ecumenical Council and removed the Monothelete Patriarch John VI of Constantinople from his position. He replaced him with the orthodox Patriarch Germanus in 715. This strategic move had several purposes. Firstly, it helped to pacify the unrest among the Orthodox population in Constantinople. Furthermore, it enhanced Anastasius&#x27; legitimacy as the emperor, which was particularly important considering his rise to power through a rebellion. To maintain imperial authority and stability, he sought various forms of proof of legitimacy. Elevating Orthodoxy effectively resolved the short-lived schism between the monarchy and the catholic Church, which was consistent with the Byzantine emperors&#x27; attempts to reconcile with Rome. Gaining the approval of Pope Constantine would have provided Anastasius with a symbol of legitimacy that his predecessor lacked, thereby reinforcing his own legitimacy by comparison.

In addition to his religion reforms, Anastasius recognized the need to address the precarious state of the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s defenses and the issue of territorial loss. The Umayyad Caliphate posed a significant threat, surrounding the Empire both by land and sea. Their incursions had reached as far as Galatia in 714. In response, Anastasius pursued diplomatic avenues to restore peace but found his emissaries unsuccessful in Damascus. Consequently, he initiated a comprehensive defensive strategy. This involved the restoration of Constantinople&#x27;s walls, the construction of siege equipment, the stockpiling of food, and the rebuilding of the Byzantine fleet. The death of Caliph al-Walid I in 715 presented an opportunity for Anastasius to reverse the situation in his favor. He dispatched an army under Leo the Isaurian, who would later become emperor, to invade Syria. Simultaneously, he ordered his fleet to concentrate on Rhodes, with instructions not only to resist the enemy&#x27;s approach but also to destroy their naval resources. Retaking the territories lost to the Caliphate served both practical advantages, such as expanding the empire&#x27;s borders, and symbolic purposes, showcasing the strength of the new regime.

=== Deposition ===
In Rhodes, a revolt occurred among the Opsician troops due to their discontent with the actions of Anastasius following his rise to power. During this mutiny, Admiral John was killed. Subsequently, the mutineers decided to overthrow Anastasius and install a new Emperor, Theodosius III (also known as Theodosios). Theodosius III, who was a relatively unknown tax-collector, was proclaimed as the new emperor. Following a siege that lasted six months, Constantinople was captured by Theodosius. Meanwhile, Anastasius had fled to Nicaea but was eventually compelled to yield to the authority of the new emperor. He retired to a monastery in Thessalonica. Theophanes the Confessor reports that Anastasius&#x27; reign lasted for 1 year and 3 months, suggesting his removal from power in September 715. However, an alternative date of November 715 is also possible.

=== Rebellion ===
Theodosius, the reigning emperor, was later deposed by Leo III, who had previously served under Anastasius. Leo would face two successive crises during his rule. The first crisis occurred when the Umayyad Caliphate besieged Constantinople, causing confusion about whether the city had been conquered. Troops stationed in Sicily declared their support for a new emperor, mistakenly believing that the capital had fallen. Although their rebellion was suppressed, the siege and the subsequent rebellion created an appearance of weakness in Leo&#x27;s new government. Observing this, Anastasius decided to rebel and reclaim the Byzantine throne.

In 719, Anastasius left Thessalonica to lead a revolt against Leo III. The instigator of the rebellion is a matter of debate, with conflicting accounts from Patriarch Nikephoros and Theophanes the Confessor. Nikephoros claims that Anastasius orchestrated the plot himself, while Theophanes suggests that Niketas Xylinites initiated the rebellion by corresponding with Anastasius. Regardless, Anastasius sought support from Tervel of Bulgaria and received a significant number of troops, as well as financial aid amounting to 50,000 litres of gold. However, Theophanes the Confessor, who provides this information elsewhere, mistakenly confuses Tervel with his eventual successor Kormesiy, leaving the possibility that Anastasius formed an alliance with the younger ruler. Another explanation posits that Kormesiy acted as a representative of Tervel during negotiations with Anastasius.

Although the coups during the Twenty Years Anarchy had seen some success, rebellions carried a high risk of failure. Therefore, Anastasius must have had a compelling reason to believe that the risk was worth taking. One explanation is that he interpreted the siege of Constantinople and the minor rebellion as indications of the state&#x27;s weakness, making him believe that a rebellion could succeed. Another possibility is that Anastasius genuinely believed that the Empire was in a state of crisis and that he was one of the few individuals capable of saving it. Lastly, it is plausible that Theophanes was accurate in asserting that Niketas Xylinites advised Anastasius to rebel.

With the Bulgarian forces by his side, Anastasius marched toward Constantinople. He had sent a message to Niketas Anthrakas, the commander of the city walls, requesting that the gates be opened upon his arrival. Unfortunately for Anastasius, the message was intercepted, leading to Niketas being beheaded and foiling Anastasius&#x27; plan to enter Constantinople easily. Unable to breach the city, Anastasius and his conspirators were handed over, by the Bulgarians, to Leo III as requested. In 719, Anastasius was executed, along with other conspirators including Niketas Xylinitas and the archbishop of Thessalonica. Anastasius&#x27; wife Irene arranged for his burial in the Church of the Holy Apostles.

=== Historiography ===
Anastasius II received historical attention several decades after his death through the works of Theophanes the Confessor and Patriarch Nikephoros. These scholars, known for their extensive coverage of Byzantine history, incorporated Anastasius II into their writings, although their focus extended beyond his specific reign. Notably, their accounts primarily revolved around the rebellion initiated by Anastasius against Leo III. Due to the proximity of their writings to the actual event, Theophanes and Nikephoros are frequently consulted as primary sources for subsequent works about Anastasius.

As historical records progressed into the 1900s, Anastasius II&#x27;s coverage tended to be contextualized within broader time periods. A common approach involved discussing his reign immediately following an account of his predecessor, Philippicus. In these records, Anastasius was often portrayed in a relatively favorable light compared to Philippicus. Additionally, some works addressing Bulgarian actions during Anastasius&#x27; lifetime also touched upon his reign.

More recent sources on Anastasius II exhibit sparser coverage, often limited to encyclopedic entries or discussions focusing on his relationship with Leo III. It is not uncommon to encounter brief mentions of Anastasius without delving into his character or achievements. One possible explanation for the limited amount of literature dedicated to Anastasius II is that Leo III is generally regarded as the emperor who succeeded where Anastasius fell short. Consequently, more works have emerged discussing Leo III and his accomplishments, leaving less scholarly attention devoted to Anastasius II. Furthermore, the brevity of Anastasius&#x27; reign, coupled with a scarcity of primary sources, could contribute to the relative lack of historical coverage he has received.

<text>The Roman Missal () is the book which contains the texts and rubrics for the celebration of the most common liturgy and Mass of the Catholic Church. There have been several editions.

==History==

===Before the Council of Trent (1570)===
Before the high Middle Ages, several books were used at Mass: a Sacramentary with the prayers, one or more books for the Scriptural readings, and one or more books for the antiphons and other chants. Gradually, manuscripts came into being that incorporated parts of more than one of these books, leading finally to versions that were complete in themselves. Such a book was referred to as a &quot;Missale Plenum&quot; ().

In 1223 Saint Francis of Assisi instructed his friars to adopt the form that was in use at the Papal Court (&quot;Rule&quot;, chapter 3). They adapted this missal further to the needs of their largely itinerant apostolate. Pope Gregory IX considered, but did not put into effect, the idea of extending this missal, as revised by the Franciscans, to the whole Western Church; and in 1277 Pope Nicholas III ordered it to be accepted in all churches in the city of Rome. Its use spread throughout Europe, especially after the invention of the printing press; but the editors introduced variations of their own choosing, some of them substantial. Printing also favoured the spread of other liturgical texts of less certain orthodoxy. The Council of Trent determined that an end must be put to the resulting disparities.

The chapel missal used during Innocent III&#x27;s papacy was largely reproduced in the Franciscan Missal, which in turn was adopted by Pope Nicholas for the Roman Missal. The later Roman Missal of 1474, which replicates the papal chapel missal of the 1200s, &quot;hardly differs at all&quot; from the Tridentine Missal promulgated in 1570.

The first printed &quot;Missale Romanum&quot; (Roman Missal), containing the &quot;Ordo Missalis secundum consuetudinem Curiae Romanae&quot; (Order of the Missal in accordance with the custom of the Roman Curia), was produced in Milan in 1474. Almost a whole century passed before the appearance of an edition officially published by order of the Holy See. During that interval, the 1474 Milanese edition was followed by at least 14 other editions: 10 printed in Venice, 3 in Paris, 1 in Lyon. For lack of a controlling authority, these editions differ, sometimes considerably.

Annotations in the hand of Cardinal Gugliemo Sirleto in a copy of the 1494 Venetian edition show that it was used for drawing up the 1570 official edition of Pope Pius V. In substance, this 1494 text is identical with that of the 1474 Milanese edition.

===From 1570 to the 1960s===

Implementing the decision of the Council of Trent, Pope Pius V promulgated, in the Apostolic Constitution &quot;Quo primum&quot; of 14 July 1570, an edition of the Roman Missal that was mandated for obligatory use throughout the Latin Church except where there was another liturgical rite that could be proven to have been in use for at least two centuries.

Some corrections to Pope Pius V&#x27;s text proved necessary, and Pope Clement VIII with his papal bull &quot;Cum Sanctissimum&quot;, replaced it with a new typical edition of the Roman Missal on 7 July 1604. (In this context, the word &quot;typical&quot; means that the text is the one to which all other printings must conform.) A further revised typical edition was promulgated by Pope Urban VIII on 2 September 1634 with the papal bull &quot;Si Quid Est&quot;.

Beginning in the late seventeenth century, France and neighbouring areas saw a flurry of independent missals published by bishops. Some of these were editions of manuscript missals already existing prior to 1370, but had undergone modifications that in some cases touched on the arbitrary. Later accusations of influence by Jansenism and Gallicanism were largely unfounded, as is shown by the fact that the Holy See did never condemned these books. This historical phenomenon of diocesan missals ended, however, when Abbot Guéranger and bishops such as Bishop Pierre-Louis Parisis of Langres initiated in the nineteenth century a vigorous polemical campaign in favour of a return to the Roman Missal. By 1875 all the French dioceses were using the Roman Missal. In 1884, Pope Leo XIII promulgated a new typical edition that took account of all the changes introduced since the time of Pope Urban VIII. 
Pope Pius X with the apostolic constitution &quot;Divino afflatu&quot;, undertook a revision of the Roman Missal, which began in 1911 and was promulgated and declared typical by his successor Pope Benedict XV on 25 July 1920. Though Pius X&#x27;s revision made few corrections, omissions, and additions to the text of the prayers in the Roman Missal, there were major changes in the rubrics, changes which were not incorporated in the section entitled &quot;&quot;Rubricae generales&quot;, but were instead printed as an additional section under the heading &quot;Additiones et variationes in rubricis Missalis.&quot;&quot; Among the major changes in the rubrics, included the abolition of the Psalter of Pius V.

Pope Pius XII in 1948, established a commission for liturgical reform led by Annibale Bugnini, who would later become one of the chief architects of the liturgical reforms of Paul VI. On 9 February 1951, Pius XII published the decree &quot;Dominicae Resurrectionis&quot; which authorized, in 1951 the introduction of revised texts for Easter Vigil. The regulations were initially deemed &quot;ad experimentum&quot; for one year, but in 1952 they were extended for another three years. After positive reports from the world&#x27;s bishops, these changes were made universally obligatory on 16 November 1955, with the decree &quot;Maxima Redemptionis Nostrae Mysteria&quot;, which took effect on 25 March 1956 (Palm Sunday), which made substantial changes to Palm Sunday, Holy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Easter Vigil. Pius XII also removed from the Vigil of Pentecost, the series of six Old Testament readings, with their accompanying Tracts and Collects, but these continued to be printed until 1962.

Acceding to the wishes of many of the bishops, Pope Pius XII judged it expedient also to reduce the rubrics of the missal to a simpler form, a simplification enacted by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Rites of 23 March 1955. The changes this made in the General Roman Calendar are indicated in General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII.

In the following year, 1956, while preparatory studies were being conducted for a general liturgical reform, Pope Pius XII surveyed the opinions of the bishops on the liturgical improvement of the Roman breviary. After duly weighing the answers of the bishops, he judged that it was time to address the need for a general and systematic revision of the rubrics of the breviary and missal. This question he referred to the special committee of experts appointed to study the general liturgical reform.

His successor, Pope John XXIII, with his apostolic letter Rubricarum instructum, issued a new typical edition of the Roman Missal, which would be promulgated in 1962. This incorporated the revised Code of Rubrics which Pope Pius XII&#x27;s commission had prepared, and which Pope John XXIII had made obligatory with effect from 1 January 1961. In the Missal, this Code of Rubrics replaced two of the documents in the 1920 edition; and the Pope&#x27;s motu proprio &quot;Rubricarum instructum&quot; took the place of the superseded Apostolic constitution &quot;Divino afflatu&quot; of Pope Pius X.

The notable changes in the 1962 Missal, incorporated were the omission of the adjective &quot;perfidis&quot; in the Good Friday Prayer for the Jews which had been removed in 1959, and the insertion of the name of Saint Joseph into the Canon (or Eucharistic Prayer) of the Mass on 8 December 1962. Before this addition, the Canon had largely remained unaltered, since the papacy of Gregory I.

===Revision following the Second Vatican Council===
The instruction &quot;Inter Oecumenici&quot; of 26 September 1964, that took effect on 7 March 1965, initiated the application to the Mass of the decisions that the Council had taken less than a year before. Permission was given for use, only in Mass celebrated with the people, the use of the vernacular , in the Biblical readings and the reintroduced Prayers of the Faithful, but, &quot;until the whole of the Ordinary of the Mass has been revised&quot;, in the chants (Kyrie, Gloria, Creed, Sanctus, Agnus Dei, and the entrance, offertory and communion antiphons) and in the parts that involved dialogue with the people, and in the Our Father, which the people could now recite entirely together with the priest. Most Episcopal Conferences quickly approved interim vernacular translations, generally different from country to country, and, after having them confirmed by the Holy See, published them in 1965. Other changes included the omission of Psalm 43 (42) at the start of Mass and the Last Gospel at the end, both of which Pope Pius V had first inserted into the Missal (having previously been private prayers said by the priest in the sacristy), and the Leonine Prayers of Pope Leo XIII. The Canon of the Mass, which continued to be recited silently, was kept in Latin.

Three years later, the second instruction &quot;Tres abhinc annos&quot; of 4 May 1967 gave permission for use of the vernacular in the Canon of the Mass, and allowed it to be said audibly and even, in part, to be chanted; the vernacular could be used even at Mass celebrated without the people being present. Use of the maniple was made optional, and at three ceremonies at which the cope was previously the obligatory vestment the chasuble could be used instead.

A new edition of the Roman Missal was promulgated by Pope Paul VI with the apostolic constitution &quot;Missale Romanum&quot; of 3 April 1969. The full text of the revised Missal was not published until the following year, and full vernacular translations appeared some years later, but parts of the Missal in Latin were already available since 1964 in non-definitive form, and provisional translations appeared without delay.

In his apostolic constitution, Pope Paul VI made particular mention of the following significant changes that he had made in the Roman Missal:
* To the single Eucharistic Prayer of the previous edition (which, with minor alterations, was preserved as the First Eucharistic Prayer) he added three alternative Eucharistic Prayers, increasing also the number of prefaces.
* The rites of the Order of Mass (in Latin, &quot;Ordo Missae&quot;) — that is, the largely unvarying part of the liturgy — were &quot;simplified, while due care is taken to preserve their substance.&quot; &quot;Elements which, with the passage of time, came to be duplicated, or were added with but little advantage&quot; were eliminated, especially in the rites for the preparation of the bread and wine, the breaking of the bread, and Communion.
* &quot;&#x27;Other elements which have suffered injury through accidents of history are now to be restored to the earlier norm of the Holy Fathers&#x27; (&quot;Sacrosanctum Concilium&quot;, art. 50), for example, the homily (see &quot;Sacrosanctum Concilium&quot;, art. 52) and the &#x27;common prayer&#x27; or &#x27;prayer of the faithful&#x27; (see &quot;Sacrosanctum Concilium&quot;, art. 53).&quot; Paul VI also added the option of &quot;a penitential rite or act of reconciliation with God and the brothers, at the beginning of the Mass&quot;, though this was neither an ancient part of the Introductory Rite nor mentioned in &quot;Sacrosanctum Concilium&quot;.
* He greatly increased the proportion of the Bible read at Mass. Even before Pius XII reduced the proportion further, only 1% of the Old Testament and 16.5% of the New Testament was read at Mass. In Pope Paul&#x27;s revision, 13.5% of the Old Testament and 71.5% of the New Testament are read. He was able to do this by having more readings at Mass and introducing a three-year cycle of readings on Sundays and a two-year cycle on weekdays.

In addition to these changes, the Pope noted that his revision considerably modified other sections of the Missal, such as the Proper of Seasons, the Proper of Saints, the Common of Saints, the Ritual Masses, and the Votive Masses, adding: &quot;In all of these changes, particular care has been taken with the prayers: not only has their number been increased, so that the new texts might better correspond to new needs, but also their text has been restored on the testimony of the most ancient evidences.&quot;

In response to the promulgation of the Mass of Paul VI, in 1969, cardinals Alfredo Ottaviani and Antonio Bacci presented the Ottaviani Intervention.

=== Editions after the Second Vatican Council ===
In 1970, the first typical edition of the Roman Missal (in Latin) bearing the title &quot;Missale Romanum ex decreto Sacrosancti Oecumenici Concilii Vaticani II instauratum&quot; was published, after being formally promulgated by Pope Paul VI in the previous year. A reprint that corrected misprints appeared in 1971. A second typical edition, with minor changes, followed in 1975. In 2000, Pope John Paul II approved a third typical edition, which appeared in 2002. This third edition added feasts, especially of some recently canonized saints, new prefaces of the Eucharistic Prayers, and additional Masses and prayers for various needs, and it revised and amplified the General Instruction of the Roman Missal.

In 2008, under Pope Benedict XVI, an emended reprint of the third edition was issued, correcting misprints and some other mistakes (such as the insertion at the beginning of the Apostles&#x27; Creed of &quot;unum&quot;, as in the Nicene Creed). A supplement gives celebrations, such as that of Saint Pio of Pietrelcina, added to the General Roman Calendar after the initial printing of the 2002 typical edition.

Three alterations required personal approval by Pope Benedict XVI:
* A change in the order in which a bishop celebrating Mass outside his own diocese mentions the local bishop and himself
* Omission from the Roman Missal of the special Eucharistic Prayers for Masses with Children (which, however, were not thereby suppressed)
* The addition of three alternatives to the standard dismissal at the end of Mass, &quot;Ite, missa est&quot; (Go forth, the Mass is ended):
** &quot;Ite ad Evangelium Domini annuntiandum&quot; (Go and announce the Gospel of the Lord)
** &quot;Ite in pace, glorificando vita vestra Dominum&quot; (Go in peace, glorifying the Lord by your life)
** &quot;Ite in pace&quot; (Go in peace)

Pope John XXIII&#x27;s 1962 edition of the Roman Missal began a period of aesthetic preference for a reduced number of illustrations in black and white instead of the many brightly coloured pictures previously included. The first post-Vatican II editions, both in the original Latin and in translation, continued that tendency. The first Latin edition (1970) had in all 12 black-and-white woodcut illustrations by Gian Luigi Uboldi. The 1974 English translation adopted by the United States episcopal conference appear in several printings. &quot;Our Sunday Visitor&quot; printed it with further illustrations by Uboldi, while the printing by &quot;Catholic Book Publishing&quot; had woodcuts in colour. The German editions of 1975 and 1984 had no illustrations, thus emphasizing the clarity and beauty of the typography. The French editions of 1974 and 1978 were also without illustrations, while the Italian editions of 1973 and 1983 contained both reproductions of miniatures in an 11th-century manuscript and stylized figures whose appropriateness is doubted by the author of a study on the subject, who also makes a similar observation about the illustrations in the Spanish editions of 1978 and 1988. The minimalist presentation in these editions contrasts strongly with the opulence of United States editions of the period between 2005 and 2011 with their many full-colour reproductions of paintings and other works of art.

The first vernacular version of the third edition (2002) of the Vatican II Roman Missal to be published was that in Greek. It appeared in 2006. The English translation. taking into account the 2008 changes, came into use in 2011. Translations into some other languages took longer: that into Italian was decided on by the Episcopal Conference of Italy at its November 2018 meeting and was confirmed by the Holy See in the following year, as announced by the conference&#x27;s president at its 22 May 2019 meeting. It replaces the 1983 Italian translation of the 1975 second Latin edition. The new text includes changes to the Italian Lord&#x27;s Prayer and Gloria. In the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, &quot;e non c&#x27;indurre in tentazione&quot; (&quot;and lead us not into temptation&quot;) becomes &quot;non abbandonarci alla tentazione&quot; (&quot;do not abandon us to temptation&quot;) and &quot;come noi li rimettiamo ai nostri debitori&quot; (&quot;as we forgive our debtors&quot;) becomes &quot;come anche noi li rimettiamo ai nostri debitori&quot; (&quot;as we too forgive our debtors&quot;). In the Gloria &quot;pace in terra agli uomini di buona volontà&quot; (&quot;peace on earth to people of good will&quot;) becomes &quot;pace in terra agli uomini, amati dal Signore&quot; (&quot;peace on earth to people, who are loved by the Lord&quot;).

===Continued use of earlier editions===

Following the promulgation of the Missal of Paul VI in 1969-70, it was generally assumed that the 1962 edition had been abrogated, however some refused to adopt the new missal, most notably the Society of Saint Pius X, created by Marcel Lefebvre. On 30 October 1971, Paul VI granted permission for use of the previous missal in England and Wales, in what became known as the Agatha Christie indult. On 3 October 1984, Pope John Paul II issued a letter known as &quot;Quattuor abhinc annos&quot; which extended the indult to bishops worldwide. 

In his motu proprio &quot;Summorum Pontificum&quot; of 7 July 2007, Pope Benedict XVI stated that the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal was never juridically abrogated and that it may be freely used by any priest of the Latin Church when celebrating Mass &quot;without a congregation&quot;. Use of the 1962 edition at Mass with a congregation is allowed, with the permission of the priest in charge of a church, for stable groups attached to this earlier form of the Roman Rite, provided that the priest using it is &quot;qualified to do so and not juridically impeded&quot; (as for instance by suspension). Accordingly, many dioceses schedule regular Masses celebrated using the 1962 edition. 

In 2021, Pope Francis, motivated by a desire to stave off what he perceived to be growing rejection of the Second Vatican Council developing from groups using the preconciliar rites, issued &quot;Traditionis custodes&quot; to restore the previous status quo of bishops having authority over the celebrations of Mass in the preconciliar Roman Rite. Francis stated in the letter that the current version of the Roman Rite ought to be regarded as the &quot;unique expression of [its] &quot;lex orandi&quot;.&quot;

Several traditionalist fraternities in full communion with the Holy See are authorised to celebrate the Mass exclusively according to the 1962 version of the Missal: such groups include the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter (FSSP), the Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest (ICKSP), the Institute of the Good Shepherd (IBP) and the Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney. However in more recent years, limited indults have been granted to certain parishes for use of the Holy Week prior to the reforms of Pius XII.

The Society of Saint Pius X (FSSPX), which rejects the reforms of the Second Vatican Council and is not in full communion with the Holy See, exclusively celebrates the Mass according to the 1962 version of the Roman Missal. Sedevacantist and sedeprivationist groups, which reject the Council and do not recognise any Pope since the Council as valid, also reject the 1962 version of the Missal, seeing it as contaminated by modernism as well and thus only celebrate Mass using the 1920 edition of the Missal, however there is a dispute among these groups, on the acceptance of the 1955 rubrics of the Paschal Triduum introduced by Pius XII: some groups, such as the Society of Saint Pius V, the Roman Catholic Institute and the Istituto Mater Boni Consilii) reject them, believing them to be the first step towards the post-Conciliar liturgical renovations; others, such as the Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen accept them, seeing them as a liturgical change by a valid Pope and, thus, binding to all Catholics. However, the CMRI does not accept the modifications to the Roman Missal by Pope John XXIII as they don&#x27;t recognise him as a valid pope.

For information on the calendars included in pre-69/70 editions (a small part of the full Missal), see General Roman Calendar of 1960, General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII, General Roman Calendar of 1954, and Tridentine calendar.

==Official English translations==
The International Commission on English in the Liturgy (ICEL) prepared an English translation of the 1970 Roman Missal, which was approved by the individual English-speaking episcopal conferences and, after being reviewed by the Holy See, was put into effect, beginning with the United States in 1973.

The authority for the episcopal conferences, with the consent of the Holy See, to decide on such translations was granted by the Second Vatican Council.

ICEL prepared a greatly altered English translation, and presented it for the consent of the Holy See in 1998. The Holy See withheld its consent and informed ICEL that the Latin text of the Missal, which must be the basis of translations into other languages, was being revised, making irrelevant a translation based on what would no longer be the official text of the Roman Missal.
On 28 March 2001, the Holy See issued the Instruction &quot;Liturgiam Authenticam&quot;, which included the requirement that in translations of the liturgical texts from the official Latin originals, &quot;the original text, insofar as possible, must be translated integrally and in the most exact manner, without omissions or additions in terms of their content, and without paraphrases or glosses. Any adaptation to the characteristics or the nature of the various vernacular languages is to be sober and discreet.&quot; This was a departure from the principle of functional equivalence promoted in ICEL translations after the Second Vatican Council.

In the following year, the third typical edition of the revised Roman Missal in Latin, which had already been promulgated in 2000, was released. These two texts made clear the need for a new official English translation of the Roman Missal, particularly because the previous one was at some points an adaptation rather than strictly a translation. An example is the rendering of the response &quot;Et cum spiritu tuo&quot; (literally, &quot;And with your spirit&quot;) as &quot;And also with you.&quot; Accordingly, the International Commission on English in the Liturgy prepared, with some hesitancy on the part of the bishops, a new English translation of the Roman Missal, the completed form of which received the approval of the Holy See in April 2010.

On 19 July 2001, the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments established an international committee of English-speaking bishops, called the Vox Clara Committee, &quot;to advise that Dicastery in its responsibilities related to the translation of liturgical texts in the English language and to strengthen effective cooperation with the Conferences of Bishops&quot;. On the occasion of the meeting of the committee in Rome in April 2002, Pope John Paul II sent them a message emphasizing that &quot;fidelity to the rites and texts of the Liturgy is of paramount importance for the Church and Christian life&quot; and charging the committee to ensure that &quot;the texts of the Roman Rite are accurately translated in accordance with the norms of the Instruction &quot;Liturgiam authenticam&quot;&quot;. &quot;Liturgiam authenticam&quot; also took from the Bishops&#x27; conferences the power to make its own translations and instituted a papal commission, Vox Clara, to revise the Bishops&#x27; work. In 2008 it made an estimated 10,000 changes to the ICEL&#x27;s proposed text. By 2017 Pope Francis had formed a commission to review and evaluate &quot;Liturgiam authenticam&quot;.

The work of making a new translation of the Roman Missal was completed in time to enable the national episcopal conference in most English-speaking countries to put it into use from the first Sunday of Advent (27 November) 2011.

As well as translating &quot;Et cum spiritu tuo&quot; as &quot;And with your spirit&quot;, which some scholars suggest refers to the gift of the Holy Spirit the priest received at ordination, in the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed &quot;consubstantial with the Father&quot; was used as a translation of &quot;consubstantialem Patri&quot; (in Greek &quot;ὁμοούσιον τῷ Πατρί&quot;), instead of &quot;of one Being with the Father&quot; (or, in the United States only, &quot;one in Being with the Father&quot;), and the Latin phrase &quot;qui pro vobis et pro multis effundetur in remissionem peccatorum&quot;, formerly translated as &quot;It will be shed for you and &quot;for all&quot; so that sins may be forgiven&quot;, was translated literally as &quot;which will be poured out for you and &quot;for many&quot; for the forgiveness of sins&quot; (see Pro multis).

This new official translation of the entire Order of Mass is available on the website of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, which also provides a comparison between the new text of the people&#x27;s parts and that hitherto in use in the United States (where the version of the Nicene Creed was slightly different from that in other English-speaking countries).

Pope Benedict XVI remarked: &quot;Many will find it hard to adjust to unfamiliar texts after nearly forty years of continuous use of the previous translation. The change will need to be introduced with due sensitivity, and the opportunity for catechesis that it presents will need to be firmly grasped. I pray that in this way any risk of confusion or bewilderment will be averted, and the change will serve instead as a springboard for a renewal and a deepening of Eucharistic devotion all over the English-speaking world.&quot;

The plan to introduce the new English translation of the missal was not without critics. Over 22,000 electronic signatures, some of them anonymous, were collected on a web petition to ask the Bishops, Cardinals and the Pope to reconsider the new translation. At the time there was open dissent from one parish in Seattle.

The Southern African Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference (Botswana, South Africa, Swaziland) put into effect the changes in the people&#x27;s parts of the revised English translation of the Order of Mass from 28 November 2008, when the Missal as a whole was not yet available. Protests were voiced on grounds of content and because it meant that Southern Africa was thus out of line with other English-speaking countries. One bishop claimed that the English-speaking conferences should have withstood the Holy See&#x27;s insistence on a more literal translation. However, when in February 2009 the Holy See declared that the change should have awaited completion of work on the Missal, the bishops conference appealed, with the result that those parishes that had adopted the new translation were directed to continue using it, while those that had not were told to await further instructions before doing so.
In view of the foreseen opposition to making changes, the various English-speaking episcopal conferences arranged catechesis on the Mass and the Missal, and made information available also on the Internet. Other initiatives included the Catholic News Agency publishing a series of ten articles on the revised translation.

In 2012, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines revised the 41-year-old liturgy with an English version of the Roman Missal, and later translated it in the vernacular to several native languages in the Philippines. For instance, in 2024, the uses the Roman Missal entitled &quot;Ang Aklat ng Mabuting Balita.&quot;

== Pope Francis&#x27; approach ==
On 9 September 2017 Pope Francis issued the motu proprio &quot;Magnum principium&quot; (&quot;The Great Principle&quot;) which allowed local bishops&#x27; conferences more authority over translation of liturgical documents. The motu proprio &quot;grants the episcopal conferences the faculty to judge the worth and coherence of one or another phrase in the translations from the original.&quot; The role of the Vatican is also modified in accord with the decree of Vatican II, to confirming texts already prepared by bishops&#x27; conferences, rather than &quot;recognition&quot; in the strict sense of Canon Law no. 838.

<doc id="25879" wikidata="Q171677" url="?curid=25879" title="Roger Bacon">
<text>Roger Bacon (; or &quot;&quot;, also &quot; Rogerus&quot;; ), also known by the scholastic accolade Doctor Mirabilis, was an medieval English polymath, philosopher, scientist, theologian and Franciscan friar who placed considerable emphasis on the study of nature through empiricism. Intertwining his Catholic faith with scientific thinking, Roger Bacon is considered one of the greatest polymaths of the medieval period. 

In the early modern era, he was regarded as a wizard and particularly famed for the story of his mechanical or necromantic brazen head. He is credited as one of the earliest European advocates of the modern scientific method, along with his teacher Robert Grosseteste. Bacon applied the empirical method of Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) to observations in texts attributed to Aristotle. Bacon discovered the importance of empirical testing when the results he obtained were different from those that would have been predicted by Aristotle.

His linguistic work has been heralded for its early exposition of a universal grammar, and 21st-century re-evaluations emphasise that Bacon was essentially a medieval thinker, with much of his &quot;experimental&quot; knowledge obtained from books in the scholastic tradition. He was, however, partially responsible for a revision of the medieval university curriculum, which saw the addition of optics to the traditional &quot;&quot;.

Bacon&#x27;s major work, the , was sent to Pope Clement IV in Rome in 1267 upon the pope&#x27;s request. Although gunpowder was first invented and described in China, Bacon was the first in Europe to record its formula.
==Life==
Roger Bacon was born in Ilchester in Somerset, England, in the early 13th century. His birth is sometimes narrowed down to 1210, 1213 or 1214, 1215 or 1220. The only source for his birth date is a statement from his 1267 &#x27; that &quot;forty years have passed since I first learned the &#x27;&quot;. The latest dates assume this referred to the alphabet itself, but elsewhere in the &quot; it is clear that Bacon uses the term to refer to rudimentary studies, the trivium or quadrivium that formed the medieval curriculum. His family appears to have been well off.

Bacon studied at Oxford. While Robert Grosseteste had probably left shortly before Bacon&#x27;s arrival, his work and legacy almost certainly influenced the young scholar and it is possible Bacon subsequently visited him and William of Sherwood in Lincoln. Bacon became a Master at Oxford, lecturing on Aristotle. There is no evidence he was ever awarded a doctorate. (The title &quot; was a posthumous scholastic accolade.) A caustic cleric named Roger Bacon is recorded speaking before the king at Oxford in 1233.
In 1237 or at some point in the following decade, he accepted an invitation to teach at the University of Paris. While there, he lectured on Latin grammar, Aristotelian logic, arithmetic, geometry, and the mathematical aspects of astronomy and music. His faculty colleagues included Robert Kilwardby, Albertus Magnus, and Peter of Spain, who may later become Pope as Pope John XXI. The Cornishman Richard Rufus was a scholarly opponent. In 1247 or soon after, he left his position in Paris.
As a private scholar, his whereabouts for the next decade are uncertain but he was likely in Oxford –1251, where he met Adam Marsh, and in Paris in 1251. He seems to have studied most of the known Greek and Arabic works on optics (then known as &quot;perspective&quot;, &#x27;). A passage in the &#x27; states that at some point he took a two-year break from his studies.

By the late 1250s, resentment against the king&#x27;s preferential treatment of his émigré Poitevin relatives led to a coup and the imposition of the Provisions of Oxford and Westminster, instituting a baronial council and more frequent parliaments. Pope Urban IV absolved the king of his oath in 1261 and, after initial abortive resistance, Simon de Montfort led a force, enlarged due to recent crop failures, that prosecuted the Second Barons&#x27; War. Bacon&#x27;s own family were considered royal partisans: De Montfort&#x27;s men seized their property and drove several members into exile.
In 1256 or 1257, he became a friar in the Franciscan Order in either Paris or Oxford, following the example of scholarly English Franciscans such as Grosseteste and Marsh. After 1260, Bacon&#x27;s activities were restricted by a statute prohibiting the friars of his order from publishing books or pamphlets without prior approval. He was likely kept at constant menial tasks to limit his time for contemplation and came to view his treatment as an enforced absence from scholarly life.

By the mid-1260s, he was undertaking a search for patrons who could secure permission and funding for his return to Oxford. For a time, Bacon was finally able to get around his superiors&#x27; interference through his acquaintance with Guy de Foulques, bishop of Narbonne, cardinal of Sabina, and the papal legate who negotiated between England&#x27;s royal and baronial factions.

In 1263 or 1264, a message garbled by Bacon&#x27;s messenger, Raymond of Laon, led Guy to believe that Bacon had already completed a summary of the sciences. In fact, he had no money to research, let alone copy, such a work and attempts to secure financing from his family were thwarted by the Second Barons&#x27; War. However, in 1265, Guy was summoned to a conclave at Perugia that elected him . William Benecor, who had previously been the courier between Henry III and the pope, now carried the correspondence between Bacon and Clement. Clement&#x27;s reply of 22 June 1266 commissioned &quot;writings and remedies for current conditions&quot;, instructing Bacon not to violate any standing &quot;prohibitions&quot; of his order but to carry out his task in utmost secrecy.

While faculties of the time were largely limited to addressing disputes on the known texts of Aristotle, Clement&#x27;s patronage permitted Bacon to engage in a wide-ranging consideration of the state of knowledge in his era. In 1267 or &#x27;68, Bacon sent the Pope his &quot;&quot;, which presented his views on how to incorporate Aristotelian logic and science into a new theology, supporting Grosseteste&#x27;s text-based approach against the &quot;sentence method&quot; then fashionable.

Bacon also sent his &#x27;, &#x27;, &quot;&quot;, an optical lens, and possibly other works on alchemy and astrology. The entire process has been called &quot;one of the most remarkable single efforts of literary productivity&quot;, with Bacon composing referenced works of around a million words in about a year.

Pope Clement died in 1268 and Bacon lost his protector. The Condemnations of 1277 banned the teaching of certain philosophical doctrines, including deterministic astrology. Some time within the next two years, Bacon was apparently imprisoned or placed under house arrest. This was traditionally ascribed to Franciscan Minister General Jerome of Ascoli, probably acting on behalf of the many clergy, monks, and educators attacked by Bacon&#x27;s 1271 &quot;&quot;.

Modern scholarship, however, notes that the first reference to Bacon&#x27;s &quot;imprisonment&quot; dates from eighty years after his death on the charge of unspecified &quot;suspected novelties&quot; and finds it less than credible. Contemporary scholars who do accept Bacon&#x27;s imprisonment typically associate it with Bacon&#x27;s &quot;attraction to contemporary prophesies&quot;, his sympathies for &quot;the radical &#x27;poverty&#x27; wing of the Franciscans&quot;, interest in certain astrological doctrines, or generally combative personality rather than from &quot;any scientific novelties which he may have proposed&quot;.

Sometime after 1278, Bacon returned to the Franciscan House at Oxford, where he continued his studies and is presumed to have spent most of the remainder of his life. His last dateable writing—the &quot;&quot;—was completed in 1292. He seems to have died shortly afterwards and been buried at Oxford.

==Works==

Medieval European philosophy often relied on appeals to the authority of Church Fathers such as St Augustine, and on works by Plato and Aristotle only known at second hand or through Latin translations. By the 13th century, new works and better versions – in Arabic or in new Latin translations from the Arabic – began to trickle north from Muslim Spain. In Roger Bacon&#x27;s writings, he upholds Aristotle&#x27;s calls for the collection of facts before deducing scientific truths, against the practices of his contemporaries, arguing that &quot;thence cometh quiet to the mind&quot;.

Bacon also called for reform with regard to theology. He argued that, rather than training to debate minor philosophical distinctions, theologians should focus their attention primarily on the Bible itself, learning the languages of its original sources thoroughly. He was fluent in several of these languages and was able to note and bemoan several corruptions of scripture, and of the works of the Greek philosophers that had been mistranslated or misinterpreted by scholars working in Latin. He also argued for the education of theologians in science (&quot;natural philosophy&quot;) and its addition to the medieval curriculum.

===&quot;Opus Majus&quot;===
Bacon&#x27;s 1267 &quot;Greater Work&quot;, the &#x27;, contains treatments of mathematics, optics, alchemy, and astronomy, including theories on the positions and sizes of the celestial bodies. It is divided into seven sections: &quot;The Four General Causes of Human Ignorance&quot; (&#x27;), &quot;The Affinity of Philosophy with Theology&quot; (&#x27;), &quot;On the Usefulness of Grammar&quot; (&#x27;), &quot;The Usefulness of Mathematics in Physics&quot; (&#x27;), &quot;On the Science of Perspective&quot; (&#x27;), &quot;On Experimental Knowledge&quot; (&#x27;), and &quot;A Philosophy of Morality&quot; (&#x27;).

It was not intended as a complete work but as a &quot;persuasive preamble&quot; (&#x27;), an enormous proposal for a reform of the medieval university curriculum and the establishment of a kind of library or encyclopedia, bringing in experts to compose a collection of definitive texts on these subjects. The new subjects were to be &quot;perspective&quot; (i.e., optics), &quot;astronomy&quot; (inclusive of astronomy proper, astrology, and the geography necessary to use them), &quot;weights&quot; (likely some treatment of mechanics but this section of the &#x27; has been lost), alchemy, agriculture (inclusive of botany and zoology), medicine, and &quot;experimental science&quot;, a philosophy of science that would guide the others. The section on geography was allegedly originally ornamented with a map based on ancient and Arabic computations of longitude and latitude, but has since been lost. His (mistaken) arguments supporting the idea that dry land formed the larger proportion of the globe were apparently similar to those which later guided Columbus.

In this work Bacon criticises his contemporaries Alexander of Hales and Albertus Magnus, who were held in high repute despite having only acquired their knowledge of Aristotle at second hand during their preaching careers. Albert was received at Paris as an authority equal to Aristotle, Avicenna and Averroes, a situation Bacon decried: &quot;never in the world [had] such monstrosity occurred before.&quot;

In Part I of the &quot;Opus Majus&quot; Bacon recognises some philosophers as the &quot;Sapientes&quot;, or gifted few, and saw their knowledge in philosophy and theology as superior to the &quot;vulgus philosophantium&quot;, or common herd of philosophers. He held Islamic thinkers between 1210 and 1265 in especially high regard calling them &quot;both philosophers and sacred writers&quot; and defended the integration of philosophy from apostate philosopher of the Islamic world into Christian learning.

====Calendrical reform====

In Part IV of the &quot;&quot;, Bacon proposed a calendrical reform similar to the later system introduced in 1582 under Pope Gregory XIII. Drawing on ancient Greek and medieval Islamic astronomy recently introduced to western Europe via Spain, Bacon continued the work of Robert Grosseteste and criticised the then-current Julian calendar as &quot;intolerable, horrible, and laughable&quot;.

It had become apparent that Eudoxus and Sosigenes&#x27;s assumption of a year of 365¼ days was, over the course of centuries, too inexact. Bacon charged that this meant the computation of Easter had shifted forward by 9 days since the First Council of Nicaea in 325. His proposal to drop one day every 125 years and to cease the observance of fixed equinoxes and solstices was not acted upon following the death of Pope Clement IV in 1268. The eventual Gregorian calendar drops one day from the first three centuries in each set of 400 years.

====Optics====
In Part V of the &quot;&quot;, Bacon discusses physiology of eyesight and the anatomy of the eye and the brain, considering light, distance, position, and size, direct and reflected vision, refraction, mirrors, and lenses. His treatment was primarily oriented by the Latin translation of Alhazen&#x27;s &quot;Book of Optics&quot;. He also draws heavily on Eugene of Palermo&#x27;s Latin translation of the Arabic translation of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Optics&quot;; on Robert Grosseteste&#x27;s work based on Al-Kindi&#x27;s &quot;Optics&quot;; and, through Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham), on Ibn Sahl&#x27;s work on dioptrics.

====Gunpowder====

A passage in the &#x27; and another in the &#x27; are usually taken as the first European descriptions of a mixture containing the essential ingredients of gunpowder. Partington and others have come to the conclusion that Bacon most likely witnessed at least one demonstration of Chinese firecrackers, possibly obtained by Franciscans—including Bacon&#x27;s friend William of Rubruck—who visited the Mongol Empire during this period. The most telling passage reads:
We have an example of these things (that act on the senses) in [the sound and fire of] that children&#x27;s toy which is made in many [diverse] parts of the world; i.e. a device no bigger than one&#x27;s thumb. From the violence of that salt called saltpetre [together with sulphur and willow charcoal, combined into a powder] so horrible a sound is made by the bursting of a thing so small, no more than a bit of parchment [containing it], that we find [the ear assaulted by a noise] exceeding the roar of strong thunder, and a flash brighter than the most brilliant lightning. 

At the beginning of the 20th century, Henry William Lovett Hime of the Royal Artillery published the theory that Bacon&#x27;s &quot;&quot; contained a cryptogram giving a recipe for the gunpowder he witnessed. The theory was criticised by Thorndike in a 1915 letter to &quot;Science&quot; and several books, a position joined by Muir, John Maxson Stillman, Steele, and Sarton. Needham et al. concurred with these earlier critics that the additional passage did not originate with Bacon and further showed that the proportions supposedly deciphered (a 7:5:5 ratio of saltpetre to charcoal to sulphur) as not even useful for firecrackers, burning slowly with a great deal of smoke and failing to ignite inside a gun barrel. The ~41% nitrate content is too low to have explosive properties.

===&quot;Secret of Secrets&quot;===

Bacon attributed the &quot;Secret of Secrets&quot; (&quot;&quot;), the Islamic &quot;Mirror of Princes&quot; (), to Aristotle, thinking that he had composed it for Alexander the Great. Bacon produced an edition of Philip of Tripoli&#x27;s Latin translation, complete with his own introduction and notes; and his writings of the 1260s and 1270s cite it far more than his contemporaries did. This led Easton and others, including Robert Steele, to argue that the text spurred Bacon&#x27;s own transformation into an experimentalist. (Bacon never described such a decisive impact himself.) The dating of Bacon&#x27;s edition of the &quot;Secret of Secrets&quot; is a key piece of evidence in the debate, with those arguing for a greater impact giving it an earlier date; but it certainly influenced the elder Bacon&#x27;s conception of the political aspects of his work in the sciences.

===Alchemy===

Bacon has been credited with a number of alchemical texts.

The &quot;Letter on the Secret Workings of Art and Nature and on the Vanity of Magic&quot; (&#x27;), also known as &quot;On the Wonderful Powers of Art and Nature&quot; (&#x27;), a likely-forged letter to an unknown &quot;William of Paris,&quot; dismisses practices such as necromancy but contains most of the alchemical formulae attributed to Bacon, including one for a philosopher&#x27;s stone and another possibly for gunpowder. It also includes several passages about hypothetical flying machines and submarines, attributing their first use to Alexander the Great. &quot;On the Vanity of Magic&quot; or &quot;The Nullity of Magic&quot; is a debunking of esoteric claims in Bacon&#x27;s time, showing that they could be explained by natural phenomena.

He wrote on the medicine of Galen, referring to the translations of Avicenna. He believed that the medicine of Galen belonged to an ancient tradition passed through Chaldeans, Greeks and Arabs. Although he provided a negative image of Hermes Trismegistus, his work was influenced by the Renaissance Hermetic thought. Bacon&#x27;s endorsement of Hermetic philosophy is evident, as his citations of the alchemical literature known as the Secretum Secretorum made several appearances in the Opus Majus. The Secretum Secretorum contains knowledge about the Hermetic Emerald Tablet, which was an integral component of alchemy, thus proving that Bacon&#x27;s version of alchemy was much less secular, and much more spiritual than once interpreted. The importance of Hermetic philosophy in Bacon&#x27;s work is also evident through his citations of classic Hermetic literature such as the Corpus Hermeticum. Bacon&#x27;s citation of the Corpus Hermeticum, which consists of a dialogue between Hermes and the pagan deity Asclepius, proves that Bacon&#x27;s ideas were much more in line with the spiritual aspects of alchemy rather than the scientific aspects. However, this is somewhat paradoxical as what Bacon was specifically trying to prove in the Opus Majus and subsequent works, was that spirituality and science were the same entity. Bacon believed that by using science, certain aspects of spirituality such as the attainment of &quot;Sapientia&quot; or &quot;Divine Wisdom&quot; could be logically explained using tangible evidence. Bacon&#x27;s Opus Majus was first and foremost, a compendium of sciences which he believed would facilitate the first step towards &quot;Sapientia&quot;. Bacon placed considerable emphasis on alchemy and even went so far as to state that alchemy was the most important science. The reason why Bacon kept the topic of alchemy vague for the most part, is due to the need for secrecy about esoteric topics in England at the time as well as his dedication to remaining in line with the alchemical tradition of speaking in symbols and metaphors.

===Linguistics===
Bacon&#x27;s early linguistic and logical works are the &quot;Overview of Grammar&quot; (&quot;Summa Grammatica&quot;), &#x27;, and the &#x27; or &quot;&quot;. These are mature but essentially conventional presentations of Oxford and Paris&#x27;s terminist and pre-modist logic and grammar. His later work in linguistics is much more idiosyncratic, using terminology and addressing questions unique in his era.

In his &quot;Greek&quot; and &quot;Hebrew Grammars&quot; (&#x27; and &#x27;), in his work &quot;On the Usefulness of Grammar&quot; (Book III of the &quot;&quot;), and in his &quot;Compendium of the Study of Philosophy&quot;, Bacon stresses the need for scholars to know several languages. Europe&#x27;s vernacular languages are not ignored—he considers them useful for practical purposes such as trade, proselytism, and administration—but Bacon is mostly interested in his era&#x27;s languages of science and religion: Arabic, Greek, Hebrew and Latin.

Bacon is less interested in a full practical mastery of the other languages than on a theoretical understanding of their grammatical rules, ensuring that a Latin reader will not misunderstand passages&#x27; original meaning. For this reason, his treatments of Greek and Hebrew grammar are not isolated works on their topic but contrastive grammars treating the aspects which influenced Latin or which were required for properly understanding Latin texts. He pointedly states, &quot;I want to describe Greek grammar for the benefit of Latin speakers&quot;. It is likely only this limited sense which was intended by Bacon&#x27;s boast that he could teach an interested pupil a new language within three days.

Passages in the &quot;Overview&quot; and the Greek grammar have been taken as an early exposition of a universal grammar underlying all human languages. The Greek grammar contains the tersest and most famous exposition:

However, Bacon&#x27;s lack of interest in studying a literal grammar underlying the languages known to him and his numerous works on linguistics and comparative linguistics has prompted Hovdhaugen to question the usual literal translation of Bacon&#x27;s &quot; in such passages. She notes the ambiguity in the Latin term, which could refer variously to the structure of language, to its description, and to the science underlying such descriptions: i.e., linguistics.

===Other works===

Bacon states that his &quot;Lesser Work&quot; (&#x27;) and &quot;Third Work&quot; (&#x27;) were originally intended as summaries of the &#x27; in case it was lost in transit. Easton&#x27;s review of the texts suggests that they became separate works over the course of the laborious process of creating a fair copy of the &#x27;, whose half-million words were copied by hand and apparently greatly revised at least once.

Other works by Bacon include his &quot;Tract on the Multiplication of Species&quot; (&#x27;), &quot;On Burning Lenses&quot; (&#x27;), the &#x27; and &#x27;, the &quot;Compendium of the Study of Philosophy&quot; and &quot;of Theology&quot; (&#x27; and &#x27;), and his &quot;Computus&quot;. The &quot;Compendium of the Study of Theology&quot;, presumably written in the last years of his life, was an anticlimax: adding nothing new, it is principally devoted to the concerns of the 1260s.

===Apocrypha===
&quot;The Mirror of Alchimy&quot; (&quot;&quot;), a short treatise on the origin and composition of metals, is traditionally credited to Bacon. It espouses the Arabian theory of mercury and sulphur forming the other metals, with vague allusions to transmutation. Stillman opined that &quot;there is nothing in it that is characteristic of Roger Bacon&#x27;s style or ideas, nor that distinguishes it from many unimportant alchemical lucubrations of anonymous writers of the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries&quot;, and Muir and Lippmann also considered it a pseudepigraph.

The cryptic Voynich manuscript has been attributed to Bacon by various sources, including by its first recorded owner, but historians of science Lynn Thorndike and George Sarton dismissed these claims as unsupported, and the vellum of the manuscript has since been dated to the 15th century.

==Legacy==

Bacon was largely ignored by his contemporaries in favour of other scholars such as Albertus Magnus, Bonaventure, and Thomas Aquinas, although his works were studied by Bonaventure, John Pecham, and Peter of Limoges, through whom he may have influenced Raymond Lull. He was also partially responsible for the addition of optics (&quot;&quot;) to the medieval university curriculum.

By the early modern period, the English considered him the epitome of a wise and subtle possessor of forbidden knowledge, a Faust-like magician who had tricked the devil and so was able to go to heaven. Of these legends, one of the most prominent was that he created a talking brazen head which could answer any question. The story appears in the anonymous 16th-century account of &quot;The Famous Historie of Fryer Bacon&quot;, in which Bacon speaks with a demon but causes the head to speak by &quot;the continuall fume of the six hottest Simples&quot;, testing his theory that speech is caused by &quot;an effusion of vapors&quot;.

Around 1589, Robert Greene adapted the story for the stage as &quot;The Honorable Historie of Frier Bacon and Frier Bongay&quot;, one of the most successful Elizabethan comedies. As late as the 1640s, Thomas Browne was still complaining that &quot;Every ear is filled with the story of Frier Bacon, that made a brazen head to speak these words, &quot;Time is&quot;&quot;. Greene&#x27;s Bacon spent seven years creating a brass head that would speak &quot;strange and uncouth aphorisms&quot; to enable him to encircle Britain with a wall of brass that would make it impossible to conquer.

Unlike his source material, Greene does not cause his head to operate by natural forces but by &quot;nigromantic charms&quot; and &quot;the enchanting forces of the devil&quot;: i.e., by entrapping a dead spirit or hobgoblin. Bacon collapses, exhausted, just before his device comes to life and announces &quot;Time is&quot;, &quot;Time was&quot;, and &quot;Time is Past&quot; before being destroyed in spectacular fashion: the stage direction instructs that &quot;a lightening flasheth forth, and a hand appears that breaketh down the Head with a hammer&quot;.

A necromantic head was ascribed to Pope Sylvester II as early as the 1120s, but Browne considered the legend to be a misunderstanding of a passage in Peter the Good&#x27;s &quot;Precious Pearl&quot; where the negligent alchemist misses the birth of his creation and loses it forever. The story may also preserve the work by Bacon and his contemporaries to construct clockwork armillary spheres. Bacon had praised a &quot;self-activated working model of the heavens&quot; as &quot;the greatest of all things which have been devised&quot;.

As early as the 16th century, natural philosophers such as Bruno, Dee and Francis Bacon were attempting to rehabilitate Bacon&#x27;s reputation and to portray him as a scientific pioneer who had avoided the petty bickering of his contemporaries to attempt a rational understanding of nature. By the 19th century, commenters following Whewell considered that &quot;Bacon ... was not appreciated in his age because he was so completely in advance of it; he is a 16th- or 17th-century philosopher, whose lot has been by some accident cast in the 13th century&quot;. His assertions in the &quot;&quot; that &quot;theories supplied by reason should be verified by sensory data, aided by instruments, and corroborated by trustworthy witnesses&quot; were (and still are) considered &quot;one of the first important formulations of the scientific method on record&quot;.

This idea that Bacon was a modern experimental scientist reflected two views of the period: that the principal form of scientific activity is experimentation and that 13th-century Europe still represented the &quot;Dark Ages&quot;. This view, which is still reflected in some 21st-century popular science books, portrays Bacon as an advocate of modern experimental science who emerged as a solitary genius in an age hostile to his ideas. Based on Bacon&#x27;s apocrypha, he is also portrayed as a visionary who predicted the invention of the submarine, aircraft, and automobile. Consistent with this view of Bacon as a man ahead of his time, H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;Outline of History&quot; attributes this prescient passage to him:Machines for navigating are possible without rowers, so that great ships suited to river or ocean, guided by one man, may be borne with greater speed than if they were full of men. Likewise, cars may be made so that without a draught animal they may be moved &quot;cum impetu inaestimabili&quot;, as we deem the scythed chariots to have been from which antiquity fought. And flying machines are possible, so that a man may sit in the middle turning some device by which artificial wings may beat the air in the manner of a flying bird.

However, in the course of the 20th century, Husserl, Heidegger and others emphasised the importance to the modern science of Cartesian and Galilean projections of mathematics over sensory perceptions of nature; Heidegger, in particular, noted the lack of such an understanding in Bacon&#x27;s works. Although Crombie, Kuhn and continued to argue for Bacon&#x27;s importance to the development of &quot;qualitative&quot; areas of modern science, Duhem, Thorndike, Carton and Koyré emphasised the essentially medieval nature of Bacon&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

Research also established that Bacon was not as isolated—and probably not as persecuted—as was once thought. Many medieval sources of and influences on Bacon&#x27;s scientific activity have been identified. In particular, Bacon often mentioned his debt to the work of Robert Grosseteste: his work on optics and the calendar followed Grosseteste&#x27;s lead, as did his idea that inductively-derived conclusions should be submitted for verification through experimental testing.

Bacon noted of William of Sherwood that &quot;nobody was greater in philosophy than he&quot;; praised Peter of Maricourt (the author of &quot;A Letter on Magnetism&quot;) and John of London as &quot;perfect&quot; mathematicians; Campanus of Novara (the author of works on astronomy, astrology, and the calendar) and a Master Nicholas as &quot;good&quot;; and acknowledged the influence of Adam Marsh and lesser figures. He was clearly not an isolated genius. The medieval church was also not generally opposed to scientific investigation and medieval science was both varied and extensive.

As a result, the picture of Bacon has changed. Bacon is now seen as part of his age: a leading figure in the beginnings of the medieval universities at Paris and Oxford but one joined in the development of the philosophy of science by Robert Grosseteste, William of Auvergne, Henry of Ghent, Albert Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, John Duns Scotus, and William of Ockham. Lindberg summarised:
Bacon was not a modern, out of step with his age, or a harbinger of things to come, but a brilliant, combative, and somewhat eccentric schoolman of the thirteenth century, endeavoring to take advantage of the new learning just becoming available while remaining true to traditional notions... of the importance to be attached to philosophical knowledge&quot;.

A recent review of the many visions of Bacon across the ages says contemporary scholarship still neglects one of the most important aspects of his life and thought: his commitment to the Franciscan order. 
His was a plea for reform addressed to the supreme spiritual head of the Christian faith, written against a background of apocalyptic expectation and informed by the driving concerns of the friars. It was designed to improve training for missionaries and to provide new skills to be employed in the defence of the Christian world against the enmity of non-Christians and of the Antichrist. It cannot usefully be read solely in the context of the history of science and philosophy.

With regard to religion&#x27;s influence on Bacon&#x27;s philosophy, Charles Sanders Peirce noted, &quot;To Roger Bacon... the schoolmen&#x27;s conception of reasoning appeared only an obstacle to truth... [but] Of all kinds of experience, the best, he thought, was interior illumination, which teaches many things about Nature which the external senses could never discover, such as the transubstantiation of bread.&quot; Later scholars have therefore viewed him as a proto-protestant.

In Oxford lore, Bacon is credited as the namesake of Folly Bridge for having been placed under house arrest nearby. Although this is probably untrue, it had formerly been known as &quot;Friar Bacon&#x27;s Bridge&quot;. Bacon is also honoured at Oxford by a plaque affixed to the wall of the new Westgate shopping centre.

==In popular culture==

To commemorate the 700th anniversary of Bacon&#x27;s approximate year of birth, Prof. J. Erskine wrote the biographical play &quot;A Pageant of the Thirteenth Century&quot;, which was performed and published by Columbia University in 1914. A fictionalised account of Bacon&#x27;s life and times also appears in the second book of James Blish&#x27;s &quot;After Such Knowledge&quot; trilogy, the 1964 &quot;Doctor Mirabilis&quot;. Bacon serves as a mentor to the protagonists of Thomas Costain&#x27;s 1945 &quot;The Black Rose&quot;, and Umberto Eco&#x27;s 1980 &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;.
Greene&#x27;s play prompted a less successful sequel &quot;John of Bordeaux&quot; and was recast as a children&#x27;s story for James Baldwin&#x27;s 1905 &quot;Thirty More Famous Stories Retold&quot;. &quot;The Brazen Head of Friar Bacon&quot; also appears in Daniel Defoe&#x27;s 1722 &quot;Journal of the Plague Year&quot;, Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s 1843 &quot;The Birth-Mark&quot; and 1844 &quot;The Artist of the Beautiful&quot;, William Douglas O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s 1891 &quot;The Brazen Android&quot; (where Bacon devises it to terrify King Henry into accepting Simon de Montfort&#x27;s demands for greater democracy), John Cowper Powys&#x27;s 1956 &quot;The Brazen Head&quot;, and Robertson Davies&#x27;s 1970 &quot;Fifth Business&quot;. Bacon appears in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s 1926 story &#x27;The Eye of Allah&#x27;.

<text>In optics, the refractive index (or refraction index) of an optical medium is the ratio of the apparent speed of light in the air or vacuum to the speed in the medium. The refractive index determines how much the path of light is bent, or refracted, when entering a material. This is described by Snell&#x27;s law of refraction, , where and are the angle of incidence and angle of refraction, respectively, of a ray crossing the interface between two media with refractive indices and . The refractive indices also determine the amount of light that is reflected when reaching the interface, as well as the critical angle for total internal reflection, their intensity (Fresnel equations) and Brewster&#x27;s angle.

The refractive index, formula_1, can be seen as the factor by which the speed and the wavelength of the radiation are reduced with respect to their vacuum values: the speed of light in a medium is , and similarly the wavelength in that medium is , where is the wavelength of that light in vacuum. This implies that vacuum has a refractive index of 1, and assumes that the frequency () of the wave is not affected by the refractive index.

The refractive index may vary with wavelength. This causes white light to split into constituent colors when refracted. This is called dispersion. This effect can be observed in prisms and rainbows, and as chromatic aberration in lenses. Light propagation in absorbing materials can be described using a complex-valued refractive index. The imaginary part then handles the attenuation, while the real part accounts for refraction. For most materials the refractive index changes with wavelength by several percent across the visible spectrum. Consequently, refractive indices for materials reported using a single value for must specify the wavelength used in the measurement.

The concept of refractive index applies across the full electromagnetic spectrum, from X-rays to radio waves. It can also be applied to wave phenomena such as sound. In this case, the speed of sound is used instead of that of light, and a reference medium other than vacuum must be chosen. Refraction also occurs in oceans when light passes into the halocline where salinity has impacted the density of the water column.

For lenses (such as eye glasses), a lens made from a high refractive index material will be thinner, and hence lighter, than a conventional lens with a lower refractive index. Such lenses are generally more expensive to manufacture than conventional ones.

==Definition==
The relative refractive index of an optical medium 2 with respect to another reference medium 1 () is given by the ratio of speed of light in medium 1 to that in medium 2. This can be expressed as follows:
formula_2
If the reference medium 1 is vacuum, then the refractive index of medium 2 is considered with respect to vacuum. It is simply represented as and is called the absolute refractive index of medium 2.

The absolute refractive index &quot;n&quot; of an optical medium is defined as the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum, , and the phase velocity of light in the medium,
formula_3
Since is constant, is inversely proportional to :
formula_4
The phase velocity is the speed at which the crests or the phase of the wave moves, which may be different from the group velocity, the speed at which the pulse of light or the envelope of the wave moves. Historically air at a standardized pressure and temperature has been common as a reference medium.

==History==
Thomas Young was presumably the person who first used, and invented, the name &quot;index of refraction&quot;, in 1807.
At the same time he changed this value of refractive power into a single number, instead of the traditional ratio of two numbers. The ratio had the disadvantage of different appearances. Newton, who called it the &quot;proportion of the sines of incidence and refraction&quot;, wrote it as a ratio of two numbers, like &quot;529 to 396&quot; (or &quot;nearly 4 to 3&quot;; for water). Hauksbee, who called it the &quot;ratio of refraction&quot;, wrote it as a ratio with a fixed numerator, like &quot;10000 to 7451.9&quot; (for urine). Hutton wrote it as a ratio with a fixed denominator, like 1.3358 to 1 (water).

Young did not use a symbol for the index of refraction, in 1807. In the later years, others started using different symbols: , , and . The symbol gradually prevailed.

==Typical values==


Refractive index also varies with wavelength of the light as given by Cauchy&#x27;s equation. The most general form of this equation is
formula_5
where is the refractive index, is the wavelength, and , , , etc., are coefficients that can be determined for a material by fitting the equation to measured refractive indices at known wavelengths. The coefficients are usually quoted for as the vacuum wavelength in micrometres.

Usually, it is sufficient to use a two-term form of the equation:
formula_6
where the coefficients and are determined specifically for this form of the equation.

For visible light most transparent media have refractive indices between 1 and 2. A few examples are given in the adjacent table. These values are measured at the yellow doublet D-line of sodium, with a wavelength of 589 nanometers, as is conventionally done. Gases at atmospheric pressure have refractive indices close to 1 because of their low density. Almost all solids and liquids have refractive indices above 1.3, with aerogel as the clear exception. Aerogel is a very low density solid that can be produced with refractive index in the range from 1.002 to 1.265. Moissanite lies at the other end of the range with a refractive index as high as 2.65. Most plastics have refractive indices in the range from 1.3 to 1.7, but some high-refractive-index polymers can have values as high as 1.76.

For infrared light refractive indices can be considerably higher. Germanium is transparent in the wavelength region from and has a refractive index of about 4. A type of new materials termed &quot;topological insulators&quot;, was recently found which have high refractive index of up to 6 in the near to mid infrared frequency range. Moreover, topological insulators are transparent when they have nanoscale thickness. These properties are potentially important for applications in infrared optics.

===Refractive index below unity===
According to the theory of relativity, no information can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum, but this does not mean that the refractive index cannot be less than 1. The refractive index measures the phase velocity of light, which does not carry information. The phase velocity is the speed at which the crests of the wave move and can be faster than the speed of light in vacuum, and thereby give a refractive index This can occur close to resonance frequencies, for absorbing media, in plasmas, and for X-rays. In the X-ray regime the refractive indices are lower than but very (exceptions close to some resonance frequencies).
As an example, water has a refractive index of for X-ray radiation at a photon energy of ( wavelength).

An example of a plasma with an index of refraction less than unity is Earth&#x27;s ionosphere. Since the refractive index of the ionosphere (a plasma), is less than unity, electromagnetic waves propagating through the plasma are bent &quot;away from the normal&quot; (see Geometric optics) allowing the radio wave to be refracted back toward earth, thus enabling long-distance radio communications. See also Radio Propagation and Skywave.

===Negative refractive index===

Recent research has also demonstrated the &quot;existence&quot; of materials with a negative refractive index, which can occur if permittivity and permeability have simultaneous negative values. This can be achieved with periodically constructed metamaterials. The resulting negative refraction (i.e., a reversal of Snell&#x27;s law) offers the possibility of the superlens and other new phenomena to be actively developed by means of metamaterials.

==Microscopic explanation==
At the atomic scale, an electromagnetic wave&#x27;s phase velocity is slowed in a material because the electric field creates a disturbance in the charges of each atom (primarily the electrons) proportional to the electric susceptibility of the medium. (Similarly, the magnetic field creates a disturbance proportional to the magnetic susceptibility.) As the electromagnetic fields oscillate in the wave, the charges in the material will be &quot;shaken&quot; back and forth at the same frequency. The charges thus radiate their own electromagnetic wave that is at the same frequency, but usually with a phase delay, as the charges may move out of phase with the force driving them (see sinusoidally driven harmonic oscillator). The light wave traveling in the medium is the macroscopic superposition (sum) of all such contributions in the material: the original wave plus the waves radiated by all the moving charges. This wave is typically a wave with the same frequency but shorter wavelength than the original, leading to a slowing of the wave&#x27;s phase velocity. Most of the radiation from oscillating material charges will modify the incoming wave, changing its velocity. However, some net energy will be radiated in other directions or even at other frequencies (see scattering).

Depending on the relative phase of the original driving wave and the waves radiated by the charge motion, there are several possibilities:
* If the electrons emit a light wave which is 90° out of phase with the light wave shaking them, it will cause the total light wave to travel slower. This is the normal refraction of transparent materials like glass or water, and corresponds to a refractive index which is real and greater than 1.
* If the electrons emit a light wave which is 270° out of phase with the light wave shaking them, it will cause the wave to travel faster. This is called &quot;anomalous refraction&quot;, and is observed close to absorption lines (typically in infrared spectra), with X-rays in ordinary materials, and with radio waves in Earth&#x27;s ionosphere. It corresponds to a permittivity less than 1, which causes the refractive index to be also less than unity and the phase velocity of light greater than the speed of light in vacuum (note that the signal velocity is still less than , as discussed above). If the response is sufficiently strong and out-of-phase, the result is a negative value of permittivity and imaginary index of refraction, as observed in metals or plasma.
* If the electrons emit a light wave which is 180° out of phase with the light wave shaking them, it will destructively interfere with the original light to reduce the total light intensity. This is light absorption in opaque materials and corresponds to an imaginary refractive index.
* If the electrons emit a light wave which is in phase with the light wave shaking them, it will amplify the light wave. This is rare, but occurs in lasers due to stimulated emission. It corresponds to an imaginary index of refraction, with the opposite sign to that of absorption.
For most materials at visible-light frequencies, the phase is somewhere between 90° and 180°, corresponding to a combination of both refraction and absorption.

==Dispersion==

The refractive index of materials varies with the wavelength (and frequency) of light. This is called dispersion and causes prisms and rainbows to divide white light into its constituent spectral colors. As the refractive index varies with wavelength, so will the refraction angle as light goes from one material to another. Dispersion also causes the focal length of lenses to be wavelength dependent. This is a type of chromatic aberration, which often needs to be corrected for in imaging systems. In regions of the spectrum where the material does not absorb light, the refractive index tends to with increasing wavelength, and thus with frequency. This is called &quot;normal dispersion&quot;, in contrast to &quot;anomalous dispersion&quot;, where the refractive index with wavelength. For visible light normal dispersion means that the refractive index is higher for blue light than for red.

For optics in the visual range, the amount of dispersion of a lens material is often quantified by the Abbe number:
formula_7
For a more accurate description of the wavelength dependence of the refractive index, the Sellmeier equation can be used. It is an empirical formula that works well in describing dispersion. &quot;Sellmeier coefficients&quot; are often quoted instead of the refractive index in tables.

===Principal refractive index wavelength ambiguity===
Because of dispersion, it is usually important to specify the vacuum wavelength of light for which a refractive index is measured. Typically, measurements are done at various well-defined spectral emission lines.

Manufacturers of optical glass in general define principal index of refraction at yellow spectral line of helium () and alternatively at a green spectral line of mercury (), called and lines respectively. Abbe number is defined for both and denoted and . The spectral data provided by glass manufacturers is also often more precise for these two wavelengths.

Both, and spectral lines are singlets and thus are suitable to perform a very precise measurements, such as spectral goniometric method.

In practical applications, measurements of refractive index are performed on various refractometers, such as Abbe refractometer. Measurement accuracy of such typical commercial devices is in the order of 0.0002. Refractometers usually measure refractive index , defined for sodium doublet (), which is actually a midpoint between two adjacent yellow spectral lines of sodium. Yellow spectral lines of helium () and sodium () are apart, which can be considered negligible for typical refractometers, but can cause confusion and lead to errors if accuracy is critical.

All three typical principle refractive indices definitions can be found depending on application and region, so a proper subscript should be used to avoid ambiguity.

==Complex refractive index==
When light passes through a medium, some part of it will always be absorbed. This can be conveniently taken into account by defining a complex refractive index,
formula_8

Here, the real part is the refractive index and indicates the phase velocity, while the imaginary part is called the extinction coefficient indicates the amount of attenuation when the electromagnetic wave propagates through the material. It is related to the absorption coefficient, formula_9, through:
formula_10
These values depend upon the frequency of the light used in the measurement.

That corresponds to absorption can be seen by inserting this refractive index into the expression for electric field of a plane electromagnetic wave traveling in the -direction. This can be done by relating the complex wave number to the complex refractive index through , with being the vacuum wavelength; this can be inserted into the plane wave expression for a wave travelling in the -direction as:
formula_11

Here we see that gives an exponential decay, as expected from the Beer–Lambert law. Since intensity is proportional to the square of the electric field, intensity will depend on the depth into the material as

formula_12

and thus the absorption coefficient is , and the penetration depth (the distance after which the intensity is reduced by a factor of ) is .

Both and are dependent on the frequency. In most circumstances (light is absorbed) or (light travels forever without loss). In special situations, especially in the gain medium of lasers, it is also possible that , corresponding to an amplification of the light.

An alternative convention uses instead of , but where still corresponds to loss. Therefore, these two conventions are inconsistent and should not be confused. The difference is related to defining sinusoidal time dependence as versus . See Mathematical descriptions of opacity.

Dielectric loss and non-zero DC conductivity in materials cause absorption. Good dielectric materials such as glass have extremely low DC conductivity, and at low frequencies the dielectric loss is also negligible, resulting in almost no absorption. However, at higher frequencies (such as visible light), dielectric loss may increase absorption significantly, reducing the material&#x27;s transparency to these frequencies.

The real , and imaginary , parts of the complex refractive index are related through the Kramers–Kronig relations. In 1986, A.R. Forouhi and I. Bloomer deduced an equation describing as a function of photon energy, , applicable to amorphous materials. Forouhi and Bloomer then applied the Kramers–Kronig relation to derive the corresponding equation for as a function of. The same formalism was applied to crystalline materials by Forouhi and Bloomer in 1988.

The refractive index and extinction coefficient, and , are typically measured from quantities that depend on them, such as reflectance, , or transmittance,, or ellipsometric parameters, and. The determination of and from such measured quantities will involve developing a theoretical expression for or , or and in terms of a valid physical model for and . By fitting the theoretical model to the measured or , or and using regression analysis, and can be deduced.

===X-ray and extreme UV===
For X-ray and extreme ultraviolet radiation the complex refractive index deviates only slightly from unity and usually has a real part smaller than 1. It is therefore normally written as (or with the alternative convention mentioned above). Far above the atomic resonance frequency delta can be given by
formula_13
where is the classical electron radius, is the X-ray wavelength, and is the electron density. One may assume the electron density is simply the number of electrons per atom multiplied by the atomic density, but more accurate calculation of the refractive index requires replacing with the complex atomic form factor It follows that
formula_14
with and typically of the order of and .

==Relations to other quantities==

===Optical path length===
Optical path length (OPL) is the product of the geometric length of the path light follows through a system, and the index of refraction of the medium through which it propagates,
formula_15
This is an important concept in optics because it determines the phase of the light and governs interference and diffraction of light as it propagates. According to Fermat&#x27;s principle, light rays can be characterized as those curves that optimize the optical path length.

===Refraction===


When light moves from one medium to another, it changes direction, i.e. it is refracted. If it moves from a medium with refractive index to one with refractive index , with an incidence angle to the surface normal of , the refraction angle can be calculated from Snell&#x27;s law:
formula_16

When light enters a material with higher refractive index, the angle of refraction will be smaller than the angle of incidence and the light will be refracted towards the normal of the surface. The higher the refractive index, the closer to the normal direction the light will travel. When passing into a medium with lower refractive index, the light will instead be refracted away from the normal, towards the surface.

===Total internal reflection===

If there is no angle fulfilling Snell&#x27;s law, i.e.,
formula_17
the light cannot be transmitted and will instead undergo total internal reflection. This occurs only when going to a less optically dense material, i.e., one with lower refractive index. To get total internal reflection the angles of incidence must be larger than the critical angle
formula_18

===Reflectivity===
Apart from the transmitted light there is also a reflected part. The reflection angle is equal to the incidence angle, and the amount of light that is reflected is determined by the reflectivity of the surface. The reflectivity can be calculated from the refractive index and the incidence angle with the Fresnel equations, which for normal incidence reduces to

formula_19

For common glass in air, and , and thus about 4% of the incident power is reflected. At other incidence angles the reflectivity will also depend on the polarization of the incoming light. At a certain angle called Brewster&#x27;s angle, &quot;p&quot;-polarized light (light with the electric field in the plane of incidence) will be totally transmitted. Brewster&#x27;s angle can be calculated from the two refractive indices of the interface as 
formula_20

===Lenses===
The focal length of a lens is determined by its refractive index and the radii of curvature and of its surfaces. The power of a thin lens in air is given by the simplified version of the Lensmaker&#x27;s formula:
formula_21
where is the focal length of the lens.

===Microscope resolution===
The resolution of a good optical microscope is mainly determined by the numerical aperture () of its objective lens. The numerical aperture in turn is determined by the refractive index of the medium filling the space between the sample and the lens and the half collection angle of light according to Carlsson (2007):
formula_22

For this reason oil immersion is commonly used to obtain high resolution in microscopy. In this technique the objective is dipped into a drop of high refractive index immersion oil on the sample under study.

===Relative permittivity and permeability===
The refractive index of electromagnetic radiation equals
formula_23
where is the material&#x27;s relative permittivity, and is its relative permeability. The refractive index is used for optics in Fresnel equations and Snell&#x27;s law; while the relative permittivity and permeability are used in Maxwell&#x27;s equations and electronics. Most naturally occurring materials are non-magnetic at optical frequencies, that is is very close to 1, therefore is approximately . In this particular case, the complex relative permittivity , with real and imaginary parts and , and the complex refractive index , with real and imaginary parts and (the latter called the &quot;extinction coefficient&quot;), follow the relation
formula_24

and their components are related by:
formula_25

and:

formula_26

where formula_27 is the complex modulus.

===Wave impedance===

The wave impedance of a plane electromagnetic wave in a non-conductive medium is given by
formula_28

where is the vacuum wave impedance, and are the absolute permeability and permittivity of the medium, is the material&#x27;s relative permittivity, and is its relative permeability.

In non-magnetic media (that is, in materials with ), formula_29 and formula_30

Thus refractive index in a non-magnetic media is the ratio of the vacuum wave impedance to the wave impedance of the medium.

The reflectivity between two media can thus be expressed both by the wave impedances and the refractive indices as
formula_31

===Density===

In general, it is assumed that the refractive index of a glass increases with its density. However, there does not exist an overall linear relationship between the refractive index and the density for all silicate and borosilicate glasses. A relatively high refractive index and low density can be obtained with glasses containing light metal oxides such as  and , while the opposite trend is observed with glasses containing  and  as seen in the diagram at the right.

Many oils (such as olive oil) and ethanol are examples of liquids that are more refractive, but less dense, than water, contrary to the general correlation between density and refractive index.

For air, is proportional to the density of the gas as long as the chemical composition does not change. This means that it is also proportional to the pressure and inversely proportional to the temperature for ideal gases. For liquids the same observation can be made as for gases, for instance, the refractive index in alkanes increases nearly perfectly linear with the density. On the other hand, for carboxylic acids, the density decreases with increasing number of C-atoms within the homologeous series. The simple explanation of this finding is that it is not density, but the molar concentration of the chromophore that counts. In homologeous series, this is the excitation of the C-H-bonding. August Beer must have intuitively known that when he gave Hans H. Landolt in 1862 the tip to investigate the refractive index of compounds of homologeous series. While Landolt did not find this relationship, since, at this time dispersion theory was in its infancy, he had the idea of molar refractivity which can even be assigned to single atoms. Based on this concept, the refractive indices of organic materials can be calculated.

=== Bandgap ===

The optical refractive index of a semiconductor tends to increase as the bandgap energy decreases. Many attempts have been made to model this relationship beginning with T. S. Moses in 1949. Empirical models can match experimental data over a wide range of materials and yet fail for important cases like InSb, PbS, and Ge. 

This negative correlation between refractive index and bandgap energy, along with a negative correlation between bandgap and temperature, means that many semiconductors exhibit a positive correlation between refractive index and temperature. This is the opposite of most materials, where the refractive index decreases with temperature as a result of a decreasing material density.

===Group index===

Sometimes, a &quot;group velocity refractive index&quot;, usually called the &quot;group index&quot; is defined:
formula_32
where is the group velocity. This value should not be confused with , which is always defined with respect to the phase velocity. When the dispersion is small, the group velocity can be linked to the phase velocity by the relation
formula_33
where is the wavelength in the medium. In this case the group index can thus be written in terms of the wavelength dependence of the refractive index as
formula_34

When the refractive index of a medium is known as a function of the vacuum wavelength (instead of the wavelength in the medium), the corresponding expressions for the group velocity and index are (for all values of dispersion)
formula_35
where is the wavelength in vacuum.

===Velocity, momentum, and polarizability===
As shown in the Fizeau experiment, when light is transmitted through a moving medium, its speed relative to an observer traveling with speed in the same direction as the light is:
formula_36

The momentum of photons in a medium of refractive index is a complex and controversial issue with two different values having different physical interpretations.

The refractive index of a substance can be related to its polarizability with the Lorentz–Lorenz equation or to the molar refractivities of its constituents by the Gladstone–Dale relation.

===Refractivity===
In atmospheric applications, refractivity is defined as , often rescaled as either or ; the multiplication factors are used because the refractive index for air, deviates from unity by at most a few parts per ten thousand.

&quot;Molar refractivity&quot;, on the other hand, is a measure of the total polarizability of a mole of a substance and can be calculated from the refractive index as
formula_37
where is the density, and is the molar mass.

==Nonscalar, nonlinear, or nonhomogeneous refraction==
So far, we have assumed that refraction is given by linear equations involving a spatially constant, scalar refractive index. These assumptions can break down in different ways, to be described in the following subsections.

===Birefringence===

In some materials, the refractive index depends on the polarization and propagation direction of the light. This is called birefringence or optical anisotropy.

In the simplest form, uniaxial birefringence, there is only one special direction in the material. This axis is known as the optical axis of the material. Light with linear polarization perpendicular to this axis will experience an &quot;ordinary&quot; refractive index while light polarized in parallel will experience an &quot;extraordinary&quot; refractive index . The birefringence of the material is the difference between these indices of refraction, . Light propagating in the direction of the optical axis will not be affected by the birefringence since the refractive index will be independent of polarization. For other propagation directions the light will split into two linearly polarized beams. For light traveling perpendicularly to the optical axis the beams will have the same direction. This can be used to change the polarization direction of linearly polarized light or to convert between linear, circular, and elliptical polarizations with waveplates.

Many crystals are naturally birefringent, but isotropic materials such as plastics and glass can also often be made birefringent by introducing a preferred direction through, e.g., an external force or electric field. This effect is called photoelasticity, and can be used to reveal stresses in structures. The birefringent material is placed between crossed polarizers. A change in birefringence alters the polarization and thereby the fraction of light that is transmitted through the second polarizer.

In the more general case of trirefringent materials described by the field of crystal optics, the &quot;dielectric constant&quot; is a rank-2 tensor (a 3 by 3 matrix). In this case the propagation of light cannot simply be described by refractive indices except for polarizations along principal axes.

===Nonlinearity===

The strong electric field of high intensity light (such as the output of a laser) may cause a medium&#x27;s refractive index to vary as the light passes through it, giving rise to nonlinear optics. If the index varies quadratically with the field (linearly with the intensity), it is called the optical Kerr effect and causes phenomena such as self-focusing and self-phase modulation. If the index varies linearly with the field (a nontrivial linear coefficient is only possible in materials that do not possess inversion symmetry), it is known as the Pockels effect.

===Inhomogeneity===
If the refractive index of a medium is not constant but varies gradually with the position, the material is known as a gradient-index (GRIN) medium and is described by gradient index optics. Light traveling through such a medium can be bent or focused, and this effect can be exploited to produce lenses, some optical fibers, and other devices. Introducing elements in the design of an optical system can greatly simplify the system, reducing the number of elements by as much as a third while maintaining overall performance. The crystalline lens of the human eye is an example of a lens with a refractive index varying from about 1.406 in the inner core to approximately 1.386 at the less dense cortex. Some common mirages are caused by a spatially varying refractive index of air.

==Refractive index measurement==

===Homogeneous media===

The refractive index of liquids or solids can be measured with refractometers. They typically measure some angle of refraction or the critical angle for total internal reflection. The first laboratory refractometers sold commercially were developed by Ernst Abbe in the late 19th century.
The same principles are still used today. In this instrument, a thin layer of the liquid to be measured is placed between two prisms. Light is shone through the liquid at incidence angles all the way up to 90°, i.e., light rays parallel to the surface. The second prism should have an index of refraction higher than that of the liquid, so that light only enters the prism at angles smaller than the critical angle for total reflection. This angle can then be measured either by looking through a telescope, or with a digital photodetector placed in the focal plane of a lens. The refractive index of the liquid can then be calculated from the maximum transmission angle as , where is the refractive index of the prism.

This type of device is commonly used in chemical laboratories for identification of substances and for quality control. Handheld variants are used in agriculture by, e.g., wine makers to determine sugar content in grape juice, and inline process refractometers are used in, e.g., chemical and pharmaceutical industry for process control.

In gemology, a different type of refractometer is used to measure the index of refraction and birefringence of gemstones. The gem is placed on a high refractive index prism and illuminated from below. A high refractive index contact liquid is used to achieve optical contact between the gem and the prism. At small incidence angles most of the light will be transmitted into the gem, but at high angles total internal reflection will occur in the prism. The critical angle is normally measured by looking through a telescope.

===Refractive index variations===

Unstained biological structures appear mostly transparent under bright-field microscopy as most cellular structures do not attenuate appreciable quantities of light. Nevertheless, the variation in the materials that constitute these structures also corresponds to a variation in the refractive index. The following techniques convert such variation into measurable amplitude differences:

To measure the spatial variation of the refractive index in a sample phase-contrast imaging methods are used. These methods measure the variations in phase of the light wave exiting the sample. The phase is proportional to the optical path length the light ray has traversed, and thus gives a measure of the integral of the refractive index along the ray path. The phase cannot be measured directly at optical or higher frequencies, and therefore needs to be converted into intensity by interference with a reference beam. In the visual spectrum this is done using Zernike phase-contrast microscopy, differential interference contrast microscopy (DIC), or interferometry.

Zernike phase-contrast microscopy introduces a phase shift to the low spatial frequency components of the image with a phase-shifting annulus in the Fourier plane of the sample, so that high-spatial-frequency parts of the image can interfere with the low-frequency reference beam. In the illumination is split up into two beams that are given different polarizations, are phase shifted differently, and are shifted transversely with slightly different amounts. After the specimen, the two parts are made to interfere, giving an image of the derivative of the optical path length in the direction of the difference in the transverse shift. In interferometry the illumination is split up into two beams by a partially reflective mirror. One of the beams is let through the sample before they are combined to interfere and give a direct image of the phase shifts. If the optical path length variations are more than a wavelength the image will contain fringes.

There exist several phase-contrast X-ray imaging techniques to determine 2D or 3D spatial distribution of refractive index of samples in the X-ray regime.

==Applications==

The refractive index is an important property of the components of any optical instrument. It determines the focusing power of lenses, the dispersive power of prisms, the reflectivity of lens coatings, and the light-guiding nature of optical fiber. Since the refractive index is a fundamental physical property of a substance, it is often used to identify a particular substance, confirm its purity, or measure its concentration. The refractive index is used to measure solids, liquids, and gases. Most commonly it is used to measure the concentration of a solute in an aqueous solution. It can also be used as a useful tool to differentiate between different types of gemstone, due to the unique chatoyance each individual stone displays. A refractometer is the instrument used to measure the refractive index. For a solution of sugar, the refractive index can be used to determine the sugar content (see Brix).

<text>The Roman Kingdom, also referred to as the Roman monarchy or the regal period of ancient Rome, was the earliest period of Roman history when the city and its territory were ruled by kings. According to tradition, the Roman Kingdom began with the city&#x27;s founding 753 BC, with settlements around the Palatine Hill along the river Tiber in central Italy, and ended with the overthrow of the kings and the establishment of the Republic 509 BC.

Little is certain about the kingdom&#x27;s history as no records and few inscriptions from the time of the kings have survived. The accounts of this period written during the Republic and the Empire are thought largely to be based on oral tradition.

==Origin==


The site of the founding of the Roman Kingdom (and eventual Republic and Empire) included a ford where one could cross the river Tiber in central Italy. The Palatine Hill and hills surrounding it provided easily defensible positions in the wide fertile plain surrounding them. Each of these features contributed to the success of the city.

The traditional version of Roman history, which has come down principally through Livy (64 or 59 BC – AD 12 or 17), Plutarch (46–120), and Dionysius of Halicarnassus ( 60 BC – after 7 BC), recounts that a series of seven kings ruled the settlement in Rome&#x27;s first centuries. The traditional chronology, as codified by Varro (116 BC – 27 BC) and Fabius Pictor ( 270 – 200 BC), allows 243 years for their combined reigns, an average of almost 35 years. Since the work of Barthold Georg Niebuhr, modern scholarship has generally discounted this schema. The Gauls destroyed many of Rome&#x27;s historical records when they sacked the city after the Battle of the Allia in 390 BC (according to Varro; according to Polybius, the battle occurred in 387–6), and what remained eventually fell prey to time or to theft. With no contemporary records of the kingdom surviving, all accounts of the Roman kings must be carefully questioned.

==Monarchy==

The kings following Romulus, the city&#x27;s founder, were elected by the people of Rome to serve for life, and did not rely upon military force to gain or keep the throne. The only king to break fully with this tradition was Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the final king, who according to tradition seized power from his predecessor and ruled as a tyrant.

The insignia of the kings of Rome were twelve lictors (attendants or servants) wielding the symbolic fasces bearing axes, the right to sit upon a curule seat, the purple &quot;toga picta&quot;, red shoes, and a white diadem around the head. Of all these insignia, the most important was the purple &quot;toga picta&quot;.

===Chief Executive===
The king was invested with supreme military, executive, and judicial authority through the use of &quot;imperium&quot;, formally granted to the king by the Curiate Assembly with the passing of the &quot;Lex curiata de imperio&quot; at the beginning of each king&#x27;s reign. The &quot;imperium&quot; of the king was held for life and protected him from ever being brought to trial for his actions. As the king was the sole owner of &quot;imperium&quot; in Rome at the time, he possessed ultimate executive power and unchecked military authority as the commander-in-chief of all of the Roman legions. Also, the laws that kept citizens safe from magistrates&#x27; misuse of &quot;imperium&quot; did not exist during the monarchical period.

The king had the power to either appoint or nominate all officials to offices. He would appoint a &quot;tribunus celerum&quot; to serve as both the tribune of the Ramnes tribe in Rome and as the commander of the king&#x27;s personal bodyguard, the &quot;celeres&quot;. The king was required to appoint the tribune upon entering office and the tribune left office upon the king&#x27;s death. The tribune was second in rank to the king and also possessed the power to convene the Curiate Assembly and lay legislation before it.

Another officer appointed by the king was the &quot;praefectus urbi&quot;, who acted as the warden of the city. When the king was absent from the city, the prefect held all of the king&#x27;s powers and abilities, even to the point of being bestowed with &quot;imperium&quot; while inside the city.

The king also received the right to be the only person to appoint patricians to the Senate.

===Chief Priest===
What is known for certain is that the king alone possessed the right to the augury on behalf of Rome as its chief augur, and no public business could be performed without the will of the gods made known through auspices. The people knew the king as a mediator between them and the gods (cf. Latin &quot;pontifex&quot;, &quot;bridge-builder&quot;, in this sense, between men and the gods) and thus viewed the king with religious awe. This made the king the head of the national religion and its chief executive. Having the power to control the Roman calendar, he conducted all religious ceremonies and appointed lower religious offices and officers. It is said that Romulus himself instituted the augurs and was believed to have been the best augur of all. Likewise, King Numa Pompilius instituted the pontiffs and through them developed the foundations of the religious dogma of Rome.

===Chief Legislator===

Under the kings, the Senate and Curiate Assembly had very little power and authority. They were not independent since they lacked the right to meet together and discuss questions of state at their own will. They could be called together only by the king (and the tribune in the case of the Curiate Assembly) and could discuss only the matters that the king laid before them. While the Curiate Assembly had the power to pass laws that had been submitted by the king, the Senate was effectively an honorary council. It could advise the king on his action but by no means could prevent him from acting. The only thing that the king could not do without the approval of the Senate and the Curiate Assembly was to declare war against a foreign nation.

===Chief Judge===
The king&#x27;s &quot;imperium&quot; both granted him military powers and qualified him to pronounce legal judgement in all cases as the chief justice of Rome. Though he could assign pontiffs to act as minor judges in some cases, he had supreme authority in all cases brought before him, both civil and criminal. This made the king supreme in times of both war and peace. While some writers believed there was no appeal from the king&#x27;s decisions, others believed that a proposal for appeal could be brought before the king by any patrician during a meeting of the Curiate Assembly.

To assist the king, a council advised him during all trials, but this council had no power to control his decisions. Also, two criminal detectives (&quot;quaestores parricidi&quot;) were appointed by him as well as a two-man criminal court (&quot;duumviri perduellionis&quot;), which oversaw cases of treason. According to Livy, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the seventh and final king of Rome, judged capital criminal cases without the advice of counsellors, thereby creating fear amongst those who might think to oppose him.

===Election of the kings===
Whenever a king died, Rome entered a period of interregnum. Supreme power of the state would devolve to the Senate, which was responsible for finding a new king. The Senate would assemble and appoint one of its own members—the interrex—to serve for a period of five days with the sole purpose of nominating the next king of Rome. If no king were nominated at the end of five days, with the Senate&#x27;s consent the interrex would appoint another Senator to succeed him for another five-day term. This process would continue until a new king was elected. Once the interrex found a suitable nominee to the kingship, he would bring the nominee before the Senate and the Senate would review him. If the Senate passed the nominee, the interrex would convene the Curiate Assembly and preside over it during the election of the king. Once the nominee was proposed to the Curiate Assembly, the citizens of Rome could either accept or reject him. If accepted, the king-elect did not immediately enter office. Two other acts still had to take place before he was invested with the full regal authority and power.

First, it was necessary to obtain the divine will of the gods respecting his appointment by means of the auspices, since the king would serve as high priest of Rome. This ceremony was performed by an augur, who conducted the king-elect to the citadel, where he was placed on a stone seat as the people waited below. If found worthy of the kingship, the augur announced that the gods had given favourable tokens, thus confirming the king&#x27;s priestly character. The second act which had to be performed was the conferral of the &quot;imperium&quot; upon the king. The Curiate Assembly&#x27;s previous vote only determined who was to be king, and had not by that act bestowed the necessary power of the king upon him. Accordingly, the king himself proposed to the Curiate Assembly a law granting him &quot;imperium&quot;, and the Curiate Assembly by voting in favor of the law would grant it. In theory, the people of Rome elected their leader, but the Senate had most of the control over the process.

===Senate===

According to legend, Romulus established the Senate after he founded Rome by personally selecting the most noble men (wealthy men with legitimate wives and children) to serve as a council for the city. As such, the Senate was the King&#x27;s advisory council as the Council of State. The Senate was composed of 300 senators, with 100 senators representing each of the three ancient tribes of Rome: the Ramnes (Latins), Tities (Sabines), and Luceres (Etruscans). Within each tribe, a senator was selected from each of the tribe&#x27;s ten curiae. The king had the sole authority to appoint the senators, but this selection was done in accordance with ancient custom.

Under the monarchy, the Senate possessed very little power and authority as the king held most of the political power of the state and could exercise those powers without the Senate&#x27;s consent. The chief function of the Senate was to serve as the king&#x27;s council and be his legislative coordinator. Once legislation proposed by the king passed the Curiate Assembly, the Senate could either veto it or accept it as law. The king was, by custom, to seek the advice of the Senate on major issues. However, it was left to him to decide what issues, if any, were brought before them and he was free to accept or reject their advice as he saw fit. Only the king possessed the power to convene the Senate, except during the interregnum, during which the Senate possessed the authority to convene itself.

===Romulus===

Son of the Vestal Virgin Rhea Silvia, ostensibly by the god Mars, the legendary Romulus was Rome&#x27;s founder and first king. After he and his twin brother Remus had deposed King Amulius of Alba and reinstated the king&#x27;s brother and their grandfather Numitor to the throne, they decided to build a city in the area where they had been abandoned as infants. After killing Remus in a dispute, Romulus began building the city on the Palatine Hill. His work began with fortifications. He permitted men of all classes to come to Rome as citizens, including slaves and freemen without distinction. He is credited with establishing the city&#x27;s religious, legal and political institutions. The kingdom was established by unanimous acclaim with him at the helm when Romulus called the citizenry to a council for the purposes of determining their government.

Romulus established the Senate as an advisory council with the appointment of 100 of the most noble men in the community. These men he called &quot;patres&quot; (from &quot;pater&quot;, father, head), and their descendants became the patricians. To project command, he surrounded himself with attendants, in particular the twelve lictors. He created three divisions of horsemen (&quot;equites&quot;), called &quot;centuries&quot;: &quot;Ramnes&quot; (Romans), &quot;Tities&quot; (after the Sabine king) and &quot;Luceres&quot; (Etruscans). He also divided the populace into 30 &quot;curiae&quot;, named after 30 of the Sabine women who had intervened to end the war between Romulus and Tatius. The &quot;curiae&quot; formed the voting units in the popular assemblies (&quot;Comitia Curiata&quot;).
Romulus was behind one of the most notorious acts in Roman history, the incident commonly known as &quot;The Rape of the Sabine Women&quot;. To provide his citizens with wives, Romulus invited the neighbouring tribes to a festival in Rome where the Romans committed a mass abduction of young women from among the attendees. The accounts vary from 30 to 683 women taken, a significant number for a population of 3,000 Latins (and presumably for the Sabines as well). War broke out when Romulus refused to return the captives. After the Sabines made three unsuccessful attempts to invade the hill settlements of Rome, the women themselves intervened during the Battle of the Lacus Curtius to end the war. The two peoples were united in a joint kingdom, with Romulus and the Sabine king Titus Tatius sharing the throne. In addition to the war with the Sabines, Romulus waged war with the Fidenates and Veientes and others.

He reigned for thirty-seven years. According to the legend, Romulus vanished at age fifty-four while reviewing his troops on the Campus Martius. He was reported to have been taken up to Mt. Olympus in a whirlwind and made a god. After initial acceptance by the public, rumours and suspicions of foul play by the patricians began to grow. In particular, some thought that members of the nobility had murdered him, dismembered his body, and buried the pieces on their land. These were set aside after an esteemed nobleman testified that Romulus had come to him in a vision and told him that he was the god Quirinus. He became not only one of the three major gods of Rome, but the very likeness of the city itself.

A replica of Romulus&#x27;s hut was maintained in the centre of Rome until the end of the Roman Empire.

===Numa Pompilius===

After Romulus died, there was an interregnum for one year, during which ten men chosen from the Senate governed Rome as successive &quot;interreges&quot;. Under popular pressure, the Senate finally chose the Sabine Numa Pompilius to succeed Romulus, on account of his reputation for justice and piety. The choice was accepted by the Curiate Assembly.

Numa&#x27;s reign was marked by peace and religious reform. He constructed a new temple to Janus and, after establishing peace with Rome&#x27;s neighbours, closed the doors of the temple to indicate a state of peace. They remained closed for the rest of his reign. He established the Vestal Virgins at Rome, as well as the Salii, and the flamines for Jupiter, Mars and Quirinus. He also established the office and duties of &quot;pontifex maximus&quot;. Numa reigned for 43 years. He reformed the Roman calendar by adjusting it for the solar and lunar year, as well as by adding the months of January and February to bring the total number of months to twelve.

===Tullus Hostilius===
Tullus Hostilius was as warlike as Romulus had been, completely unlike Numa as he lacked any respect for the gods. Tullus waged war against Alba Longa, Fidenae and Veii and the Sabines. During Tullus&#x27;s reign, the city of Alba Longa was completely destroyed and Tullus integrated its population into Rome. Tullus is attributed with constructing a new home for the Senate, the Curia Hostilia, which survived for 562 years after his death.

According to Livy, Tullus neglected the worship of the gods until, towards the end of his reign, he fell ill and became superstitious. However, when Tullus called upon Jupiter and begged assistance, Jupiter responded with a bolt of lightning that burned the king and his house to ashes. His reign lasted for 32 years.

===Ancus Marcius===

Following the mysterious death of Tullus, the Romans elected a peaceful and religious king in his place, Numa&#x27;s grandson, Ancus Marcius. Much like his grandfather, Ancus did little to expand the borders of Rome and only fought wars to defend the territory. He also built Rome&#x27;s first prison on the Capitoline Hill.

Ancus further fortified the Janiculum Hill on the western bank, and built the first bridge across the Tiber River. He also founded the port of Ostia Antica on the Tyrrhenian Sea and established Rome&#x27;s first salt works, as well as the city&#x27;s first aqueduct. Rome grew, as Ancus used diplomacy to peacefully unite smaller surrounding cities into alliance with Rome. Thus, he completed the conquest of the Latins and relocated them to the Aventine Hill, thus forming the plebeian class of Romans.

He died a natural death, like his grandfather, after 25 years as king, marking the end of Rome&#x27;s Latin–Sabine kings.

===Lucius Tarquinius Priscus===
Lucius Tarquinius Priscus was the fifth king of Rome and the first of Etruscan birth. After immigrating to Rome, he gained favor with Ancus, who later adopted him as son. Upon ascending the throne, he waged wars against the Sabines and Etruscans, doubling the size of Rome and bringing great treasures to the city. To accommodate the influx of population, the Aventine and Caelian hills were populated.

One of his first reforms was to add 100 new members to the Senate from the conquered Etruscan tribes, bringing the total number of senators to 200. He used the treasures Rome had acquired from the conquests to build great monuments for Rome. Among these were Rome&#x27;s great sewer systems, the Cloaca Maxima, which he used to drain the swamp-like area between the Seven Hills of Rome. In its place, he began construction on the Roman Forum. He also founded the Roman games.

Priscus initiated great building projects, including the city&#x27;s first bridge, the Pons Sublicius. The most famous is the Circus Maximus, a giant stadium for chariot races. After that, he started the building of the temple-fortress to the god Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill. However, before it was completed, he was killed by a son of Ancus Marcius, after 38 years as king. His reign is best remembered for introducing the Roman symbols of military and civil offices, and the Roman triumph, being the first Roman to celebrate one.

===Servius Tullius===

Priscus was succeeded by his son-in-law Servius Tullius, Rome&#x27;s second king of Etruscan birth, and the son of a slave. Like his father-in-law, Servius fought successful wars against the Etruscans. He used the booty to build the first wall all around the Seven Hills of Rome, the &quot;pomerium&quot;. He also reorganized the army.

Servius Tullius instituted a new constitution, further developing the citizen classes. He instituted Rome&#x27;s first census, which divided the population into five economic classes, and formed the Centuriate Assembly. He used the census to divide the population into four urban tribes based on location, thus establishing the Tribal Assembly. He also oversaw the construction of the Temple of Diana on the Aventine Hill.

Servius&#x27; reforms made a big change in Roman life: voting rights based on socio-economic status, favouring elites. However, over time, Servius increasingly favoured the poor in order to gain support from plebeians, often at the expense of patricians. After a 44-year reign, Servius was killed in a conspiracy by his daughter Tullia and her husband Lucius Tarquinius Superbus.

===Lucius Tarquinius Superbus===

The seventh and final king of Rome was Lucius Tarquinius Superbus. He was the son of Priscus and the son-in-law of Servius, whom he and his wife had killed.

Tarquinius waged a number of wars against Rome&#x27;s neighbours, including against the Volsci, Gabii and the Rutuli. He also secured Rome&#x27;s position as head of the Latin cities. He also engaged in a series of public works, notably the completion of the Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, and works on the Cloaca Maxima and the Circus Maximus. However, Tarquin&#x27;s reign is remembered for his use of violence and intimidation to control Rome and his disrespect for Roman custom and the Roman Senate.

Tensions came to a head when the king&#x27;s son, Sextus Tarquinius, raped Lucretia, wife and daughter to powerful Roman nobles. Lucretia told her relatives about the attack, and committed suicide to avoid the dishonour of the episode. Four men, led by Lucius Junius Brutus, and including Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus, Publius Valerius Poplicola, and Spurius Lucretius Tricipitinus incited a revolution that deposed and expelled Tarquinius and his family from Rome in 509 BC.

Tarquin was viewed so negatively that the word for king, &quot;rex&quot;, held a negative connotation in the Latin language until the fall of the Roman Empire.

Lucius Junius Brutus and Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus became Rome&#x27;s first consuls, marking the beginning of the Roman Republic. This new government would survive for the next 500 years until the rise of Julius Caesar and Augustus, and would cover a period during which Rome&#x27;s authority and area of control extended to cover vast areas of Europe, North Africa, and West Asia. He ruled 25 years.

==Public offices after the monarchy==

The constitutional history of the Roman Republic began with the revolution that overthrew the monarchy in 509 BC and ended with constitutional reforms that transformed the Republic into what would effectively be the Roman Empire, in 27 BC. The Roman Republic&#x27;s constitution was a constantly evolving, unwritten set of guidelines and principles passed down mainly through precedent, by which the government and its politics operated.

===Senate===


The senate&#x27;s authority derived from the senators&#x27; esteem and prestige. This esteem and prestige were based on both precedent and custom, as well as the senators&#x27; calibre and reputation. The senate passed decrees called . These were officially &quot;advice&quot; from the senate to a magistrate, but in practice, the magistrates usually followed them. Through the course of the middle republic and Rome&#x27;s expansion, the senate became more dominant in the state: the only institution with the expertise to administer the empire effectively, it controlled state finances, assignment of magistrates, external affairs, and deployment of military forces. Also, a powerful religious body, it received reports of omens and directed Roman responses thereto.

When its prerogatives started to be challenged in the 2nd century, the senate lost its customary preapproval for legislation. Moreover, after the precedent set in 121 BC with the killing of Gaius Gracchus, the senate claimed to assume the power to issue a : such decrees directed magistrates to take whatever actions were necessary to safeguard the state, irrespective of legality, and signalled the senate&#x27;s willingness to support that magistrate if such actions were later challenged in the courts.

Its members were usually appointed by censors, who ordinarily selected newly elected magistrates for membership in the senate, making the senate a partially elected body. Status was not hereditary and there were always some new men, though sons of former magistrates found it easier to be elected to the qualifying magistracies. During emergencies, a dictator could be appointed for the purpose of appointing senators (as was done after the Battle of Cannae). However, by the end of the republic men such as Caesar and the members of the Second Triumvirate usurped these powers for themselves.

===Legislative assemblies===

The legal status of Roman citizenship was limited and a vital prerequisite to possessing many important legal rights, such as the right to trial and appeal, marry, vote, hold office, enter binding contracts, and to special tax exemptions. An adult male citizen with the full complement of legal and political rights was called (). Citizens who were elected their assemblies, whereupon the assemblies elected magistrates, enacted legislation, presided over trials in capital cases, declared war and peace, and forged or dissolved treaties. There were two types of legislative assemblies: the (&#x27;committees&#x27;), which were assemblies of all citizens , and the (&quot;councils&quot;), which were assemblies of specific groups of citizens .

Citizens were organized on the basis of centuries and tribes, which each gathered into their own assemblies. The (&#x27;Centuriate Assembly&#x27;) was the assembly of the centuries (that is., soldiers). The Comitia Centuriata&#x27;s president was usually a consul. The centuries voted, one at a time, until a measure received support from a majority. The Comitia Centuriata elected magistrates who had (consuls and praetors). It also elected censors. Only the Comitia Centuriata could declare war and ratify the results of a census. It served as the highest court of appeal in certain judicial cases.

The assembly of the tribes, that is, the citizens of Rome, the Comitia Tributa, was presided over by a consul, and composed of 35 tribes. Once a measure received support from a majority of the tribes, voting ended. While it did not pass many laws, the Comitia Tributa did elect quaestors, curule aediles, and military tribunes. The Plebeian Council was identical to the assembly of the tribes but excluded the patricians. They elected their own officers, plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles. Usually, a plebeian tribune would preside over the assembly. This assembly passed most laws and could act as a court of appeal.

===Magistrates===

Each republican magistrate held certain constitutional powers. Each was assigned a by the Senate. This was the scope of that particular office holder&#x27;s authority. It could apply to a geographic area or to a particular responsibility or task. The powers of a magistrate came from the people of Rome (both plebeians and patricians). was held by both consuls and praetors. Strictly speaking, it was the authority to command a military force, but in reality, it carried broad authority in other public spheres, such as diplomacy and the justice system. In extreme cases, those with the imperium power could sentence Roman Citizens to death. All magistrates also had the power of (coercion). Magistrates used this to maintain public order by imposing punishment for crimes. Magistrates also had both the power and the duty to look for omens. This power could also be used to obstruct political opponents.

One check on a magistrate&#x27;s power was (&#x27;collegiality&#x27;). Each magisterial office was held concurrently by at least two people. Another such check was . While in Rome, all citizens were protected from coercion, by , an early form of due process. It was a precursor to . If any magistrate tried to use the powers of the state against a citizen, that citizen could appeal the magistrate&#x27;s decision to a tribune. In addition, once a magistrate&#x27;s one-year term of office expired, he would have to wait ten years before serving in that office again. This created problems for some consuls and praetors, and these magistrates occasionally had their extended. In effect, they retained the powers of the office (as a promagistrate) without officially holding that office.

In times of military emergency, a dictator was appointed for a term of six months. Constitutional government was dissolved, and the dictator was the absolute master of the state. When the dictator&#x27;s term ended, constitutional government was restored.

The censor was a magistrate in ancient Rome who was responsible for maintaining the census, supervising public morality, and overseeing certain aspects of the government&#x27;s finances. The power of the censor was absolute: no magistrate could oppose his decisions, and only another censor who succeeded him could cancel those decisions. The censor&#x27;s regulation of public morality is the origin of the modern meaning of the words &quot;censor&quot; and &quot;censorship&quot;. During the census, they could enroll citizens in the senate or purge them from the senate.

The consuls of the Roman Republic were the highest-ranking ordinary magistrates. Each served for one year. Consular powers included the kings&#x27; former and appointment of new senators. Consuls had supreme power in both civil and military matters. While in the city of Rome, the consuls were the head of the Roman government. They presided over the senate and the assemblies. While abroad, each consul commanded an army. His authority abroad was nearly absolute.

Since the tribunes were considered the embodiment of the plebeians, they were sacrosanct. Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge the plebeians took to kill anyone who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office. It was a capital offense to harm a tribune, disregard his veto, or otherwise interfere with him.

Praetors administered civil law and commanded provincial armies. Aediles were officers elected to conduct domestic affairs in Rome, such as managing public games and shows. The quaestors usually assisted the consuls in Rome, and the governors in the provinces. Their duties were often financial.

<doc id="25886" wikidata="Q663348" url="?curid=25886" title="Rán">
<text>In Norse mythology, Rán (Old Norse: ) is a goddess and a personification of the sea. Rán and her husband Ægir, a jötunn who also personifies the sea, have nine daughters, who personify waves. The goddess is frequently associated with a net, which she uses to capture sea-goers. According to the prose introduction to a poem in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; and in &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, Rán once loaned her net to the god Loki.

Rán is attested in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;, compiled during the 13th century from earlier traditional sources; the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, written during the 13th century by Snorri Sturluson; in both &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; and &quot;Friðþjófs saga hins frœkna&quot;; and in the poetry of skalds, such as &quot;Sonatorrek&quot;, a 10th-century poem by Icelandic skald Egill Skallagrímsson.

==Etymology==
The Old Norse common noun &quot;rán&quot; means &#x27;plundering&#x27; or &#x27;theft, robbery&#x27;. In turn, scholars view the theonym &quot;Rán&quot; as meaning, for example, &#x27;theft, robbery&#x27;. On the etymology of the theonym, scholar Rudolf Simek says, &quot;although the meaning of the name has not been fully clarified, Rán was probably understood as being &#x27;robber&#x27; ... and has nothing to do with [Old Norse] &quot;ráða&quot; &#x27;rule&#x27;.

Because Rán is a personification of the sea, skalds employ her name in a variety of kennings to refer to the sea. Examples include &quot;Ránar-land&quot; (&#x27;Ran&#x27;s land&#x27;), &quot;-salr&quot; (&#x27;Rán&#x27;s hall&#x27;), and &quot;-vegr&quot; (&#x27;Rán&#x27;s way&#x27;), and &quot;rán-beðr&quot; (&#x27;the bed of Rán&#x27;) and meaning &#x27;the bed of the sea&#x27;.

==Attestations==
===&quot;Sonatorrek&quot;===
Rán and Ægir receive mention in the poem &quot;Sonatorrek&quot; attributed to 10th century Icelandic skald Egill Skallagrímsson. In the poem, Egill laments the death of his son Böðvar, who drowned at sea during a storm:

In one difficult stanza later in the poem, the skald expresses the pain of losing his son by invoking the image of slaying the personified sea, personified as Ægir (Old Norse &quot;ǫlsmið[r]&quot; &#x27;ale-smith&#x27;) and Rán (&quot;Ægis man&quot; &#x27;Ægir&#x27;s wife&#x27;):
===&quot;Poetic Edda&quot;===

Rán receives three mentions in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;; twice in poetry and once in prose. The first mention occurs in a stanza in &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana I&quot;, when the valkyrie Sigrún assists the ship of the hero Helgi Hundingsbane as it encounters ferocious waters:

In the notes for her translation, Larrington says that Rán &quot;seeks to catch and drown men in her net&quot; and that &quot;to give someone to the sea-goddess is to drown them.&quot;

The second instance occurs in a stanza found in &quot;Helgakviða Hjörvarðssonar&quot;. In this stanza, the hero Atli references Rán while flyting with Hrímgerðr, a female jötunn:

Finally, in the prose introduction to &quot;Reginsmál&quot;, Loki visits Rán (here rendered as &quot;Ron&quot;) to borrow her net:
:[Odin and Hœnir] sent Loki to get the gold; he went to Ron and got her net, and went then to Andvari&#x27;s fall and cast the net in front of the pike, and the pike leaped into the net.

Translator Henry Adams Bellows notes how this version of the narrative differs from how it appears in other sources, where Loki catches the pike with his own hands.

===&quot;Prose Edda&quot;===

The &quot;Prose Edda&quot; sections &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; and &quot;Háttatal&quot; contain several references to Rán. Section 25 of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; (&quot;How shall sea be referred to?&quot;) manners in which poets may refer to the sea, including &quot;husband of Ran&quot; and &quot;land of Ran and of Ægir&#x27;s daughters&quot;, but also &quot;father of Ægir&#x27;s daughters&quot;.

In the same section, the author cites a fragment of a work by the 11th century Icelandic skald Hofgarða-Refr Gestsson, where Rán is referred to as &#x27;Gymir&#x27;s ... völva&#x27;:
The section&#x27;s author comments that the stanza &quot;[implies] that they are all the same, Ægir and Hler and Gymir. The author follows with a quote from another stanza by the skald that references Rán:

:But sea-crest-Sleipnir [ship], spray-driven, tears his breast, covered with red paint, out of white Ran&#x27;s mouth [the sea&#x27;s grasp].
Chapter 33 of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot; discusses why skalds may refer to gold as &quot;Ægir&#x27;s fire&quot;. The section traces the kenning to a narrative surrounding Ægir, in which the jötunn employs &quot;glowing gold&quot; in the center of his hall to light it &quot;like fire&quot; (which the narrator compares to flaming swords in Valhalla). The section explains that &quot;Ran is the name of Ægir&#x27;s wife, and the names of their nine daughters are as was written above ... Then the Æsir discovered that Ran had a net in which she caught everyone that went to sea ... so this is the story of the origin of gold being called fire or light or brightness of Ægir, Ran or Ægir&#x27;s daughters, and from such kennings the practice has now developed of calling gold fire of the sea and of all terms for it, since Ægir and Ran&#x27;s names are also terms for the sea, and hence gold is now called fire of lakes or rivers and of all river-names.&quot;

In the &quot;Nafnaþulur&quot; section of &quot;Skáldskaparmál&quot;, Rán appears in a list of goddesses (Old Norse &quot;ásynjur&quot;).

===&quot;Völsunga saga&quot; and &quot;Friðþjófs saga hins frœkna&quot;===
Rán receives a single mention in &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;. Like in the prose introduction to the eddic poem &quot;Reginsmál&quot; (discussed above), &quot;they sent Loki to obtain the gold. He went to Ran and got her net.&quot;

In the legendary saga &quot;Friðþjófs saga hins frœkna&quot;, Friðþjófr and his men find themselves in a violent storm, and the protagonist mourns that he will soon rest in Rán&#x27;s bed:

The protagonist then decides that as they are to &quot;go to Rán&quot; (&quot;at til Ránar skal fara&quot;) they would better do so in style with gold on each man. He divides the gold and talks of her again:
==Scholarly reception and interpretation==
According to Rudolf Simek, &quot;... Rán is the ruler of the realm of the dead at the bottom of the sea to which people who have drowned go.&quot; Simek says that &quot;while Ægir personifies the sea as a friendly power, Rán embodies the sinister side of the sea, at least in the eyes of the late Viking Age Icelandic seafarers.&quot;

<doc id="25892" wikidata="Q334648" url="?curid=25892" title="Roxy Music">
<text>Roxy Music are an English rock band formed in 1970 by lead vocalist and principal songwriter Bryan Ferry and bassist Graham Simpson. By the time the band recorded their first album in 1972, Ferry and Simpson were joined by saxophonist and oboist Andy Mackay, guitarist Phil Manzanera, drummer Paul Thompson and synthesizer player Brian Eno. Other members during the band&#x27;s history include keyboardist and violinist Eddie Jobson and bassist John Gustafson. The band split in 1976, reformed in 1978 and split again in 1983. In 2001, Ferry, Mackay, Manzanera and Thompson reunited for a concert tour and have toured together intermittently ever since, most recently in 2022 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of their first album. Ferry has also frequently enlisted band members as backing musicians during his solo career.

Roxy Music became a successful act in Europe and Australia during the 1970s. This success began with their first album in 1972. The band pioneered more musically sophisticated elements of glam rock while significantly influencing early English punk music, and provided a model for many new wave acts while innovating elements of electronic composition. The group also conveyed their distinctive brand of visual and musical sophistication with their focus on glamorous fashions. Roxy Music&#x27;s final studio album was &quot;Avalon&quot; (1982), which was certified Platinum in the United States, where the band had spent their first ten years as a moderately successful cult band.

Outside of the band, Ferry and Eno have had influential solo careers, with Eno also becoming one of the most significant British record producers of the late 20th century. In 2019, Roxy Music were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1970–1971)===
In November 1970, Bryan Ferry, who had just lost his job teaching ceramics at a girls&#x27; school for holding impromptu record-listening sessions, advertised for a keyboardist to collaborate with him and Graham Simpson, a bassist he knew from his Newcastle University formed band, the Gas Board, and with whom he collaborated on his first songs. Andy Mackay replied to Ferry&#x27;s advertisement. Although more proficient on saxophone and oboe, Mackay owned an EMS VCS 3 synthesizer. He had met Brian Eno during university days, as both were interested in avant-garde and electronic music. Although Eno was a non-musician, he could operate a synthesizer and owned a Revox reel-to-reel tape machine, so Mackay convinced him to join the band as a technical adviser. Before long Eno was an official member of the group. Rounding out the original sextet were guitarist Roger Bunn (who had issued the well-regarded solo studio album &quot;Piece of Mind&quot; earlier in 1970) and drummer Dexter Lloyd, a classically trained timpanist. The group&#x27;s name was derived from Ferry and Mackay making a list of old cinemas, and Ferry picking Roxy because it had a &quot;resonance&quot;, some &quot;faded glamour&quot;, and &quot;didn&#x27;t really mean anything&quot;. After learning of an American band with the name Roxy, Ferry changed the name to Roxy Music, a play on &quot;rock music&quot;.

At some time during late 1970/early 1971, Ferry auditioned as lead vocalist for King Crimson, who were seeking a replacement for Gordon Haskell. While Robert Fripp and Peter Sinfield decided Ferry&#x27;s voice was unsuitable for King Crimson&#x27;s material, they were impressed with his talent and helped the fledgling Roxy Music to obtain a recording contract with E.G. Records.

In 1971, Roxy Music recorded a demo tape of some early compositions. In the spring of that year, Lloyd left the band, and an advertisement was placed in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; saying &quot;wonder drummer wanted for an avant rock group&quot;. Paul Thompson responded to the advertisement and joined the band in June 1971.

Bunn left the group at the end of the summer of 1971, and in October, Roxy Music advertised in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; seeking the &quot;Perfect Guitarist&quot;. The successful applicant was David O&#x27;List, former guitarist with the Nice. Phil Manzanera—soon to become a group member—was one of about twenty other players who also auditioned. Although he did not initially make the band as a guitarist, the group were impressed enough with Manzanera that he was invited to become Roxy Music&#x27;s roadie, an offer which he accepted. In December 1971, after a year of writing and rehearsing, Roxy Music began playing live, with their first show at the Friends of the Tate Gallery Christmas show in London.

The band&#x27;s fortunes were greatly increased by the support of broadcaster John Peel and &quot;Melody Maker&quot; journalist Richard Williams. Williams became an enthusiastic fan after meeting Ferry and being given a demonstration tape during mid-1971, and wrote the first major article on the band, featured on &quot;Melody Maker&quot;″s &quot;Horizons&quot; page in the edition of 7 August 1971. This line-up of Roxy Music (Ferry/Mackay/Eno/Simpson/Thompson/O&#x27;List) recorded a BBC session shortly thereafter.

===First two studio albums (1972–1973)===
In early February 1972, guitarist O&#x27;List quit the group abruptly after an altercation with Paul Thompson, which took place at their audition for David Enthoven of E.G. Management. When O&#x27;List did not show up for the next rehearsal, Manzanera was asked to come along, on the pretext of becoming the band&#x27;s sound mixer. When he arrived he was invited to play guitar and quickly realised that it was an informal audition. Unbeknownst to the rest of the group, Manzanera had learned their entire repertoire and as a result, he was immediately hired as O&#x27;List&#x27;s permanent replacement, joining on 14 February 1972. Manzanera, the son of an English father and a Colombian mother, had spent a considerable amount of time in South America and Cuba as a child, and although he did not have the same art school background as Ferry, Mackay and Eno, he was perhaps the most proficient member of the band, with an interest in a wide variety of music. Manzanera also knew other well-known musicians, such as Pink Floyd&#x27;s David Gilmour, who was a friend of his elder brother, and Soft Machine&#x27;s Robert Wyatt. Two weeks after Manzanera joined the band, Roxy Music signed with E.G. Management. 

E.G. Management financed the recording of the tracks for their debut album, &quot;Roxy Music&quot;, recorded in March–April 1972 and produced by King Crimson lyricist Peter Sinfield. Both the album and its famous cover artwork by photographer Karl Stoecker were apparently completed before the group signed with Island Records. A&amp;R staffer Tim Clark later stated that although he argued strongly that Island should contract them, company boss Chris Blackwell at first seemed unimpressed and Clark assumed he was not interested. A few days later, however, Clark and Enthoven were standing in the hallway of the Island offices examining cover images for the album when Blackwell walked past, glanced at the artwork and said &quot;Looks great! Have we got them signed yet?&quot; The band signed with Island Records a few days later. The album was released in June to good reviews and became a major success, reaching No. 10 on the UK Albums Chart in September 1972. Manzanera said in an interview in 2024 that the band received five percent of the profits, to be divided between six musicians.

During the first half of 1972, bassist Graham Simpson became increasingly withdrawn and uncommunicative, which led to his leaving the band almost immediately after the recording of the debut album. He was replaced by Rik Kenton.

To bring more attention to their studio album, Roxy Music decided to record and release a single. Their debut single was &quot;Virginia Plain&quot;, which scored No. 4 on the UK singles chart. The band&#x27;s eclectic visual image, captured in their debut performance on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, became a cornerstone for the glam trend in the UK. The success of the single caused a renewed interest in the album.

Rik Kenton left the band in January 1973. John Porter, who had been a member of Ferry&#x27;s pre-Roxy Music band the Gas Board, agreed to play bass with the band temporarily, though he turned down an offer to join permanently. Roxy Music&#x27;s second album, &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot;, was released in March 1973. It marked the beginning of the band&#x27;s long, successful collaboration with producer Chris Thomas, who worked on all of the group&#x27;s classic albums and singles in the 1970s. The album was promoted with the non-album single &quot;Pyjamarama&quot;; no album track was released as a single. At the time Ferry was dating French model Amanda Lear; she was photographed with a black jaguar for the front cover of the album, while Ferry appears on the back cover as a dapper chauffeur standing behind a limousine.

===&quot;Stranded&quot;, &quot;Country Life&quot;, &quot;Siren&quot;, and solo projects (1973–1977)===
Soon after the tour to promote &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot; ended, Brian Eno left Roxy Music amidst increasing differences with Ferry. He was replaced by 18-year-old multi-instrumentalist Eddie Jobson, formerly of progressive rockers Curved Air, who played keyboards and electric violin. Although some fans lamented the loss of the experimental attitude and camp aesthetic that Eno had brought to the band, the classically trained Jobson was an accomplished musician. John Porter also ceased working with the band at this time. For the next three years, Roxy Music would undergo several more changes in bassist, with John Gustafson, Sal Maida, John Wetton and Rick Wills all passing in and out of the band during this period.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; referred to the band&#x27;s next two albums, &quot;Stranded&quot; (1973) and &quot;Country Life&quot; (1974), as marking &quot;the zenith of contemporary British art rock&quot;. The songs on these albums also cemented Ferry&#x27;s persona as the epitome of the suave, jaded Euro-sophisticate. Although this persona undoubtedly began as a deliberately ironic device, during the mid-1970s it seemed to merge with Ferry&#x27;s real life, as the working-class miner&#x27;s son from the north of England became an international rock star and an icon of male style.

On the first two Roxy Music albums, all songs were written solely by Bryan Ferry. Beginning with &quot;Stranded&quot;, Mackay and Manzanera began to co-write some material. Gradually, their songwriting and musicianship became more integrated into the band&#x27;s sound, although Ferry remained the dominant songwriter; throughout their career, all but one of Roxy Music&#x27;s singles were written either wholly or jointly by Ferry (Manzanera, Mackay and Thompson did individually write a few of the band&#x27;s B-sides). &quot;Stranded&quot; was released in November 1973, and produced the Top 10 single &quot;Street Life&quot;.

The fourth album, &quot;Country Life&quot;, was released in 1974, and was the first Roxy Music album to enter the US Top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, albeit at No. 37. &quot;Country Life&quot; was met with widespread critical acclaim, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; referring to it &quot;as if Ferry ran a cabaret for psychotics, featuring chanteurs in a state of shock&quot;. Roxy Music&#x27;s fifth album &quot;Siren&quot; (1975) contained their only US Top 40 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;Love Is the Drug&quot;, while Jobson received his only writing credit in Roxy Music on the song &quot;She Sells&quot;, a co-write with Ferry. The album cover featured American model Jerry Hall, who became Ferry&#x27;s girlfriend and eventual fiancé before leaving him for Mick Jagger of the Rolling Stones in 1977.

After the concert tours in support of &quot;Siren&quot; in 1976, Roxy Music disbanded. Their live album &quot;Viva!&quot; was released in August 1976. In 1976, Manzanera reunited with Eno on the critically acclaimed one-off &quot;801 Live&quot; album.

===Final studio albums and hiatus (1978–1983)===
Roxy Music reunited during 1978 to record a new studio album, &quot;Manifesto&quot;, but with a reshuffled line-up. Jobson was reportedly not contacted for the reunion; at the time, he was touring and recording with his own band, U.K., alongside fellow ex-Roxy Music member John Wetton. In place of Jobson, Paul Carrack now played keyboards for Roxy Music, while bass duties were split between Alan Spenner and Gary Tibbs. On the subsequent tour, the core band of Ferry, Mackay, Manzanera and Thompson were augmented by Tibbs and keyboardist Dave Skinner. 

Three singles were issued from &quot;Manifesto&quot;, including the major UK hits &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; (UK No. 4), and &quot;Dance Away&quot; (UK No. 2). Both these tracks are significantly different from the album versions, as &quot;Dance Away&quot; was remixed for single release, and &quot;Angel Eyes&quot; was entirely re-recorded, with a disco, rather than rock, arrangement.

After the tour and before the recording of the next album, &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot; (1980), Thompson broke his thumb in a motorcycle mishap and took a leave from the band. After Ferry, Mackay and Manzanera completed the album with several session drummers, Thompson rejoined them, briefly, in the spring of 1980 and made some television appearances as part of the album&#x27;s early promotion. By the time the &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot; tour properly began, Thompson had left again due to musical differences with Ferry.

At this point, the band officially became a core trio of Ferry, Mackay and Manzanera, augmented by a variety of musicians over the next few years including Alan Spenner, Gary Tibbs, Paul Carrack, drummer Andy Newmark and guitarist Neil Hubbard. &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot; (1980) became a huge commercial success in their homeland, as the album went to No. 1 on the UK charts, and spun off three UK hits: &quot;Oh Yeah&quot; (UK No. 5), &quot;Over You&quot; (UK No. 5), and &quot;Same Old Scene&quot; (UK No. 12).

However, the changed cast reflected a distinct change in Roxy Music&#x27;s musical style. Gone were the unpredictable elements of the group&#x27;s sound, giving way to smoother musical arrangements. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; panned &quot;Manifesto&quot; (&quot;Roxy Music has not gone disco. Roxy Music has not particularly gone anywhere else either.&quot;) as well as &quot;Flesh + Blood&quot; (&quot;such a shockingly bad Roxy Music record that it provokes a certain fascination&quot;), while other sources praised the reunion. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said, of &quot;Manifesto&quot;, &quot;...reservations aside, this may be the first such return bout ever attempted with any degree of genuine success: a technical knockout against the odds.&quot;

In 1981, Roxy Music recorded the non-album single &quot;Jealous Guy&quot;. A cover version of a song written and originally recorded by John Lennon, Roxy Music recorded &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; as a tribute to Lennon after his 1980 murder. The song topped the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in March 1981, becoming the band&#x27;s only No. 1 single.

Later, with more sombre and carefully sculpted soundscapes, the band&#x27;s eighth—and final—studio album, &quot;Avalon&quot; (1982), recorded at Chris Blackwell&#x27;s Compass Point Studios, was a major commercial success and restored the group&#x27;s critical reputation and contained the successful single &quot;More Than This&quot;. The album also included several Roxy Music classics, such as &quot;Avalon&quot;, &quot;The Main Thing&quot;, &quot;The Space Between&quot;, &quot;True to Life&quot;, and &quot;To Turn You On&quot;. Ferry, Mackay and Manzanera (augmented by several additional players) toured extensively from August 1982 to May 1983, with the &quot;Avalon&quot; tour being documented on the band&#x27;s second live album &quot;The High Road&quot;, released in March 1983. A home video was also released titled &quot;The High Road&quot;, capturing an August 1982 show at Fréjus where Roxy Music co-headlined with King Crimson (whose set from the same show was released on home video as &quot;The Noise&quot;). A further live album from this tour, &quot;Heart Still Beating&quot;, was released in 1990, while &quot;The High Road&quot; home video was released on DVD in 2001.

After completion of the &quot;Avalon&quot; tour, Roxy Music dissolved. For the next eighteen years Ferry, Mackay and Manzanera all devoted themselves full-time to solo careers.

===Reunions (2001–2011, 2019, 2022)===
Ferry, Manzanera, Mackay and Thompson re-formed in 2001 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the band, and toured extensively. A festival performance in Portugal and a short tour of the United States followed. Absent was Brian Eno, who criticised the motives of the band&#x27;s reunion, saying, &quot;I just don&#x27;t like the idea. It leaves a bad taste&quot;. Later Eno remarked that his comment had been taken out of context. Manzanera and Thompson recorded and toured with Ferry on his eleventh solo studio album &quot;Frantic&quot; (2002). Eno also contributed to &quot;Frantic&quot; on the track &quot;I Thought&quot;.

During 2002, Image Entertainment, Inc., released the concert DVD &quot;Roxy Music Live at the Apollo&quot; featuring performances of 20 songs plus interviews and rehearsal footage.

In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked the group No. 98 on its list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.

Roxy Music gave a live performance at the Isle of Wight Festival 2005 on 11 June 2005, their first UK concert since the 2001–2002 world tour. On 2 July 2005, the band played &quot;Jealous Guy&quot;, &quot;Do the Strand&quot;, and &quot;Love is the Drug&quot; at the Berlin contribution to Live 8; &quot;Do the Strand&quot; is available on the four-disc DVD collection, and &quot;Love Is the Drug&quot; can be found on the &quot;Live 8 Berlin&quot; DVD.

In March 2005, it was announced on Phil Manzanera&#x27;s official site that the band, including Brian Eno, had decided to record an album of new material. The project would mark the first time Eno worked with Roxy Music since 1973&#x27;s &quot;For Your Pleasure&quot;. After a number of denials that he would be involved with any Roxy Music reunion, on 19 May 2006 Eno revealed that he had contributed two songs to the new album as well as playing keyboards on other tracks. He did, however, rule out touring with the band. Ferry eventually announced that the material from these sessions would instead be released as a Ferry solo studio album, with Eno playing on &quot;a couple of tracks&quot;. Had the record been released as a Roxy Music album, it would have been the first album since &quot;Manifesto&quot; on which original drummer Paul Thompson performed. The album was released in 2010 as the Ferry solo studio album &quot;Olympia&quot;. It featured contributions from Eno, Manzanera, and Mackay (amongst many other session players).
During early 2006 a classic Roxy Music track, &quot;The Main Thing&quot;, was remixed by Malcolm Green and used as the soundtrack to a pan-European television commercial for the Opel Vectra featuring celebrated football referee Pierluigi Collina. In July that year, the band toured Europe. They concentrated mostly on places they had never visited before, such as Serbia and North Macedonia. Drummer Andy Newmark, who had been one of the many additional musicians Roxy Music worked with during the 1979–1983 period, performed during the tour, as Thompson withdrew due to health issues, and Oliver Thompson (guitar) made his first appearance with the band.

In a March 2007 interview with the &quot;Western Daily Press&quot;, Ferry confirmed that the next Roxy Music album was definitely being made, but would not be vended for another &quot;year and a half&quot;, as he had just released and toured behind his twelfth solo studio album, &quot;Dylanesque&quot;, consisting of Bob Dylan covers. In June 2007, the band hired a Liverpool-based design agency to develop a website supporting their new album. Early in the year, Manzanera revealed that the band were planning to sign a recording contract. In an October 2007 interview, Ferry said the album would include a collaboration with Scissor Sisters.

Over the summer of 2010, Roxy Music headlined various festivals across the world, including Lovebox at London&#x27;s Victoria Park, Electric Picnic in Stradbally, County Laois, Ireland, and Bestival on the Isle of Wight. Owing to illness, Thompson was replaced on three dates of the tour by Andy Newmark, but returned for the Bestival set.

Roxy Music performed seven dates around the UK in January and February 2011, in a tour billed For Your Pleasure, to celebrate the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary. They toured Australia and New Zealand between February and March for a further eight shows.

In 2012, Virgin Records released a box set entitled &quot;Roxy Music: The Complete Studio Recordings 1972–1982&quot;, celebrating 40 years since the release of the band&#x27;s debut in 1972.

In a &quot;Rolling Stone Magazine&quot; interview on 3 November 2014, Manzanera stated that Roxy Music had been inactive since 2011 and were unlikely to perform together again. Of a new studio album, he told &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, &quot;We all listened to it and thought, &#x27;We can&#x27;t do this. It&#x27;s not going to be any good. Let&#x27;s just bin it.&#x27; And so it&#x27;s just sitting there on our personal computers. Maybe one day it&#x27;ll get finished. But there&#x27;s no point in putting it out if it&#x27;s not great.&quot;

On 29 March 2019, Roxy Music were inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, with Ferry, Mackay, Manzanera and Eddie Jobson performing a six-song set at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.

Roxy Music reformed in 2022 for a 50th anniversary tour of the United Kingdom and the United States to be held that autumn. Most North American tour dates featured St. Vincent as a supporting act. Nilüfer Yanya was the UK starter act.

==Style==
Roxy Music have been associated with a range of genres including art rock, glam rock, pop rock, progressive rock, art pop, new wave, soft rock, synth-pop and sophisti-pop. The early style and presentation of Roxy Music was influenced by the art school backgrounds of its principal members. Ferry, Mackay and Eno all had studied at prominent UK art colleges during the mid-to-late 1960s, when these institutions were introducing courses that avoided traditional art teaching practice, with its emphasis on painting, and instead focused on more recent developments, most notably pop art, and explored new concepts such as cybernetics. As writer Michael Bracewell notes in his book &quot;Roxy: The Band that Invented an Era&quot;, Roxy Music was created expressly by Ferry, Mackay and Eno as a means of combining their mutual interests in music, modern art and fashion.

Ferry studied at Newcastle University in the 1960s under renowned pop artist and educator Richard Hamilton, and many of Ferry&#x27;s university friends, classmates and tutors—e.g. Rita Donagh and Tim Head—became well-known artists in their own right. Eno studied at Winchester School of Art and although his iconoclastic style became apparent early and caused some conflict with the college establishment, it also resulted in him meeting important artists and musicians including Cornelius Cardew and Gavin Bryars. His interest in electronic music also resulted in his first meetings with Andy Mackay, who was studying at University of Reading and who had likewise developed a strong interest in avant-garde and electronic music.

The three eventually joined forces in London during 1970–71 after meeting through mutual friends and decided to form a rock band.

Roxy Music were initially influenced by other artists of the time including the Beatles, the Kinks, the Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Elton John, the Animals, Pink Floyd, King Crimson, Jimi Hendrix, the Velvet Underground and the Who, as well as American rock and roll acts and genres such as Elvis Presley and Motown. Ferry stated that Roxy Music&#x27;s unique sound came as a result of the diverse and eclectic musical backgrounds of the band&#x27;s members; &quot;I had lots of musical influences, Phil Manzanera had this Latin heritage, being born in South America. Saxophone and oboe player Andy Mackay was classically trained. Eno with his deep interest in experimental music. They were specialists in their field. Paul Thompson brought a lot, with his very powerful, earthy drumming.&quot;

Roxy Music were one of the first rock music groups to create and maintain a carefully crafted look and style, which included their stage presentation, music videos, album and single cover designs, and promotional materials such as posters, handbills, cards and badges. They were assisted in this by a group of friends and associates who helped to sculpt the classic Roxy Music &#x27;look&#x27;, notably fashion designer Antony Price, hair stylist Keith Mainwaring, photographer Karl Stoecker, the group&#x27;s &quot;PR consultant&quot; Simon Puxley (a former university friend of Mackay) and Ferry&#x27;s art school classmate Nicholas de Ville. Well-known critic Lester Bangs went so far as to say that Roxy Music represented &quot;the triumph of artifice&quot;. Ferry later attributed the band&#x27;s look to his interest in American music and popular culture icons including Marilyn Monroe, Motown and Stax Records artists. He also stated he wanted to create an alternative image to publicity shots of pop and rock groups at the time which would feature artists &quot;in a dreary street, looking rather sullen. Which was the norm.&quot;

The band&#x27;s self-titled debut album, produced by King Crimson&#x27;s Pete Sinfield, was the first in a series of albums with increasingly sophisticated covers, with art direction by Ferry in collaboration with his friend Nick De Ville. The album artwork imitated the visual style of classic &quot;girlie&quot; and fashion magazines, featuring high-fashion shots of scantily clad models Amanda Lear, Marilyn Cole and Jerry Hall, each of whom had romances with Ferry during the time of their contributions, as well as model Kari-Ann Moller who appears on the cover of the first Roxy Music studio album but who was not otherwise involved with anyone in the band, and who later married Mick Jagger&#x27;s brother Chris. The title of the fourth Roxy Music studio album, &quot;Country Life&quot;, was intended as a parody of the well-known British rural magazine &quot;Country Life&quot;, and the visually punning front cover photo featured two models (two German fans, Constanze Karoli—sister of Can&#x27;s Michael Karoli—and Eveline Grunwald) clad only in semi-transparent lingerie standing against an evergreen hedge. As a result, in many areas of the US the album was sold in an opaque plastic wrapper because retailers refused to display the cover. Later, an alternative cover, featuring just a picture of the forest, was used.

==Legacy and influence==
In 2005, Tim de Lisle of &quot;The Guardian&quot; argued that Roxy Music are the second most influential British band after the Beatles. He wrote, &quot;Somehow, in a landscape dominated by Led Zeppelin at one end and the Osmonds at the other, they managed to reach the Top 10 with a heady mixture of futurism, retro rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll, camp, funny noises, silly outfits, art techniques, film references and oboe solos. And although their popularity has ebbed and flowed, their influence has been strikingly consistent.&quot; In 2019, &quot;The Economist&quot; also described them as &quot;the best British art-rock band since the Beatles&quot;, arguing that &quot;among English rock acts of that time, their spirit of adventure and their impact&quot; was &quot;surpassed only&quot; by David Bowie. Bowie himself cited Roxy Music as one of his favourite British groups and in a 1975 television interview described Bryan Ferry as &quot;spearheading some of the best music to come out of England.&quot;

Roxy Music&#x27;s sound and visual style have been described as a significant influence on later genres and subcultures such as electronic music, punk rock, disco, new wave and new romantic. Madness are among the artists that have cited Roxy Music as an influence. They paid tribute to Bryan Ferry in the song &quot;4BF&quot; (the title is a reference to the song &quot;2HB&quot;, itself a tribute to Humphrey Bogart from the first Roxy Music studio album). Other artists who have cited or been described as influenced by Roxy Music include Melvins, Wire, Parquet Courts, Crime, Nile Rodgers, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Duran Duran, U2, the Smiths, Spandau Ballet, Radiohead, Scissor Sisters, Talking Heads, Imogen Heap, Goldfrapp, Pulp, Sex Pistols, the Human League, Todd Terje and Franz Ferdinand.

In 1997, bassist John Taylor of Duran Duran produced the tribute album &quot;Dream Home Heartaches... Remaking/Remodeling Roxy Music&quot;. The compilation features Taylor as well as Dave Gahan (Depeche Mode) and Low Pop Suicide, among others.

Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones named his first band &quot;the Strand&quot; after the Roxy Music song &quot;Do the Strand&quot;. Jones has also described Roxy Music&#x27;s style as a strong influence on the later punk craze of which he would go on to become a part, and cited their first album as one of his all-time favourites.

The electronic band Ladytron took their name from the title of a song from Roxy Music&#x27;s first album.

The British band Bananarama took their name, in part, from the Roxy Music song &quot;Pyjamarama&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Roxy Music&#x27;s work has been featured in a number of soundtracks for both film and television. The track &quot;If There Is Something&quot; plays a symbolic role in the 2008 drama/coming-of-age movie &quot;Flashbacks of a Fool&quot; directed by Baillie Walsh and starring Daniel Craig. In the film, the younger version of Craig&#x27;s character is also shown dressing up as Bryan Ferry during a flashback scene set in the 1970s. Sofia Coppola&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; features Bill Murray&#x27;s character Bob Harris singing an off-key version of &quot;More Than This&quot; in a karaoke club. It was used on a Nissan TV advertisement in 1999. &quot;More Than This&quot; also is danced to by Toni Collette&#x27;s character in the 2019 mystery film &quot;Knives Out&quot; and was featured in the Cold War set television show &quot;The Americans&quot;. The title song &quot;Avalon&quot; of the 1982 studio album &quot;Avalon&quot; was featured in the 2005 Nick Love film &quot;The Business&quot;. Guy Ritchie&#x27;s 2020 black comedy crime film &quot;The Gentlemen&quot; features &quot;In Every Dream Home a Heartache&quot; during an action sequence.

Cover versions of &quot;2HB,&quot; &quot;Ladytron,&quot; and &quot;Bitter-Sweet&quot; are performed by the fictional band in Todd Haynes&#x27; 1998 film about the glam rock scene, &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;.

An antagonist character in the Capcom video game &quot;Final Fight&quot; named Roxy (a female acrobatic fighter) is named after the band, as are other enemy characters in the game that pay homage to someone or something related to music, like her identical partner Poison (named for the band Poison.

In early April 2021, an image of a purported 1971 letter addressed to &quot;Mr B. Ferry&quot; circulated widely on social media. The document appeared to be a rejection note, sent to Ferry by one &quot;Hugh C. Smith&quot;, an Artists &amp; Repertoire manager at Polydor Records, in which &quot;Smith&quot; patronisingly critiqued a demo tape that the group had submitted to the label. According to a 4 April 2021 item in &quot;Treble&quot; e-zine, the letter was in fact an April Fools&#x27; Day prank which apparently originated from the Twitter account of former Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club drummer Chris Frantz. In May 2021, Tony Barrell, a British writer and Roxy Music fan, announced that he was the author of the letter.

<text>Robert Fripp (born 16 May 1946) is a British musician, composer, record producer, and author, best known as the guitarist, founder and longest-lasting member of the progressive rock band King Crimson. He has worked extensively as a session musician and collaborator, notably with David Bowie, Blondie, Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel, Daryl Hall, the Roches, Talking Heads, and David Sylvian. He also composed the startup sound of Windows Vista, in collaboration with Tucker Martine and Steve Ball. His discography includes contributions to more than 700 official releases.

His compositions often feature unusual asymmetric rhythms, influenced by classical and folk traditions. His innovations include a tape delay system known as &quot;Frippertronics&quot; (superseded in the 1990s by a more sophisticated digitally-based system called &quot;Soundscapes&quot;) and a New Standard Tuning system for guitar.

Fripp is married to English singer Toyah Willcox.

==Early life==
Robert Fripp was born in Wimborne Minster, Dorset, England, the second child of a working-class family. His mother Edith (&quot;née&quot; Greene; 1914–1993) was from a Welsh mining family; Fripp considers himself to be half Welsh. Her earnings from working at the Bournemouth Records Office allowed his father, Arthur Henry Fripp (1910–1985) to start a business as an estate agent. In 1957, at age eleven, Fripp received a guitar for Christmas from his parents and recalled, &quot;Almost immediately I knew that this guitar was going to be my life&quot;. He then took guitar lessons from Kathleen Gartell and Don Strike; Elvis Presley&#x27;s guitarist Scotty Moore inspired Fripp to play rock and roll, moving on to traditional jazz at thirteen and modern jazz at fifteen. Fripp has cited jazz musicians Charlie Parker and Charles Mingus as musical influences during this time.

In 1961, the fifteen-year-old Fripp joined his first band, the Ravens, which also included Gordon Haskell on bass. After they split in the following year, Fripp concentrated on his O-level studies and joined his father&#x27;s firm as a junior negotiator. At this point, he intended to study estate management and, eventually, take over his father&#x27;s business. However, at seventeen, Fripp decided to become a professional musician. He became the guitarist in the jazz outfit The Douglas Ward Trio, playing in the Chewton Glen hotel in New Milton, followed by a stint in the rock and roll band The League of Gentlemen, which included two former Ravens members.

In 1965, Fripp left the group to attend Bournemouth College, where he studied economics, economic history, and political history for his A-levels. In February 1965, Fripp went to see the Duke Ellington Orchestra, an experience which moved him deeply. He subsequently spent three further years playing light jazz in the Majestic Dance Orchestra at Bournemouth&#x27;s Majestic Hotel (replacing Andy Summers, who had left for London with Zoot Money). During this time, Fripp met musicians that he would collaborate with in his career, including John Wetton, Richard Palmer-James, and Greg Lake. At age 21, going back home from college late at night, Fripp tuned on to Radio Luxembourg, where he heard the last moments of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;. &quot;Galvanized&quot; by the experience, he went on to listen to the Beatles&#x27; 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, Béla Bartók&#x27;s string quartets, Antonín Dvořák&#x27;s &quot;New World Symphony&quot;, Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; and John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers. Many years later, Fripp would recall that &quot;although all the dialects are different, the voice was the same... I knew I couldn&#x27;t say no&quot;. As a band leader, Fripp pointed out that Miles Davis and Duke Ellington inspired him to seek &quot;constant change&quot;.

==Career==
===1967–1974: Giles, Giles and Fripp and King Crimson===
In 1967, Fripp responded to an advertisement placed by Bournemouth-born brothers Peter and Michael Giles, who wanted to work with a singing organist. Though Fripp was not what they sought, his audition with them was a success and the trio relocated to London and became Giles, Giles and Fripp. Their only studio album, &quot;The Cheerful Insanity of Giles, Giles and Fripp&quot;, was released in 1968. Despite the recruitment of two further members – singer Judy Dyble (formerly with Fairport Convention and later of Trader Horne) and multi-instrumentalist Ian McDonald – Fripp felt that he was outgrowing the eccentric pop approach favoured by Peter Giles, preferring the more ambitious compositions being written by McDonald, and the band broke up in 1968.
Almost immediately, Fripp, McDonald and Michael Giles formed the first lineup of King Crimson in mid-1968, recruiting Fripp&#x27;s old Bournemouth College friend Greg Lake as lead singer and bassist and McDonald&#x27;s writing partner Peter Sinfield as lyricist, light show designer and general creative consultant. King Crimson&#x27;s debut album, &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot;, was released in late 1969 to great success: drawing on rock, jazz and European folk/classical music ideas, it is now regarded as one of the most influential albums in the history of progressive rock. The band was tipped for stardom, but, due to growing musical differences between Fripp on one side and Giles and McDonald on the other, broke up after its first American tour in 1970. A despondent Fripp offered to leave if it would allow King Crimson to survive; however, Giles and McDonald had independently decided that the band&#x27;s music was &quot;more Fripp&#x27;s than theirs&quot; and that it would be better if they were the ones to leave.

During the recording of the band&#x27;s second album &quot;In the Wake of Poseidon&quot;, Greg Lake departed to form Emerson, Lake and Palmer with Keith Emerson of the Nice and Carl Palmer of Atomic Rooster. King Crimson issued two more albums, &quot;Lizard&quot; and &quot;Islands,&quot; with Fripp and Sinfield the only constants in a regularly changing lineup variously including Gordon Haskell, woodwind player Mel Collins, drummers Andy McCulloch and Ian Wallace and future Bad Company bassist Boz Burrell, in addition to a palette of guest players. Fripp was listed as the sole composer of the band&#x27;s music during this time, which built on the first album&#x27;s blueprint but progressed further into jazz-rock and free jazz while also taking form from Sinfield&#x27;s esoteric lyrical and mythological concepts.

In 1971, Fripp ousted Sinfield and took over &quot;de facto&quot; leadership of King Crimson (although he has always formally rejected the label, preferring to describe his role as &quot;quality control&quot; or &quot;a kind of glue&quot;). From this point onwards, Fripp would be the only constant member of the band, which in turn would be defined primarily by his compositional and conceptual ideas. With avant-garde percussionist Jamie Muir, violinist David Cross, former Family bassist and singer John Wetton and former Yes drummer Bill Bruford now in the ranks, King Crimson produced three more albums of innovative and increasingly experimental rock, shedding members as they progressed: beginning with &quot;Larks&#x27; Tongues in Aspic&quot;, progressing with &quot;Starless and Bible Black&quot; after Muir&#x27;s departure and culminating in &quot;Red&quot; after Cross was fired. Fripp formally disbanded the group in 1974, in what eventually turned out to be merely the first in a regular series of long hiatuses and further transformations.

===1974–1981: Collaborations, side projects, and solo career===
Fripp pursued side projects during King Crimson&#x27;s less active periods. He worked with Keith Tippett (and others who appeared on King Crimson records) on projects far from rock music, playing with and producing Centipede&#x27;s &quot;Septober Energy&quot; in 1971 and &quot;Ovary Lodge&quot; in 1973. During this period he also worked with Van der Graaf Generator, playing on their albums &quot;H to He, Who Am the Only One&quot; and &quot;Pawn Hearts&quot;. He produced Matching Mole&#x27;s &quot;Matching Mole&#x27;s Little Red Record&quot; in 1972. Prior to forming the &quot;Larks&quot;-era KC, he collaborated on a spoken-word album with a woman he described as &quot;a witch&quot;, but the resulting &quot;Robert Fripp &amp; Walli Elmlark: The Cosmic Children of Rock&quot; was never officially released.

With Brian Eno, Fripp recorded &quot;(No Pussyfooting)&quot; in 1972, and &quot;Evening Star&quot; in 1974. These experimented with several avant-garde musical techniques that were new to rock. On &quot;The Heavenly Music Corporation&quot; from No Pussyfooting, Fripp used a delay system using two modified Revox A77 reel-to-reel tape machines. The technique went on to play a central role in Fripp&#x27;s later work, and became known as &quot;Frippertronics&quot;.

In 1973, Fripp performed the guitar solo on &quot;Baby&#x27;s on Fire&quot; from Eno&#x27;s solo album &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot;. In 1975, Fripp and Eno played live shows in Europe, and Fripp also contributed guitar solos to Eno&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Another Green World&quot;.

Fripp started what was intended as a permanent sabbatical from his musical career in 1975, during which he studied at J. G. Bennett&#x27;s International Academy for Continuous Education, becoming interested in the mystical and philosophical ideas of Bennett&#x27;s teacher George Gurdjieff. He returned to musical work the following year as a session guitarist on Peter Gabriel&#x27;s debut solo album, released in 1977. Fripp toured with Gabriel to support the album, but used the pseudonym &quot;Dusty Rhodes&quot; and concealed himself on stage.

Fripp also produced and played on Gabriel&#x27;s second album in 1978. &quot;Robert is particularly skilful at keeping things fresh, and I like that a lot,&quot; Gabriel enthused. &quot;I was very interested in Robert&#x27;s experimental side; that corresponded exactly to what I wanted to do on this second record… There are two &quot;(Fripp)&quot; solos: one on &#x27;On the Air&#x27; and the other on &#x27;White Shadow&#x27;. And then he plays on &#x27;Exposure&#x27;. He gives the colour to this piece, being fifty per cent responsible for its construction. And he also plays classical guitar here and there. He&#x27;s a musician I admire a lot, because he&#x27;s one of the only ones to mix discipline and madness with so much talent.&quot;

In 1977, Fripp played on David Bowie&#x27;s album &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; at Eno&#x27;s invitation. Fripp soon collaborated with Daryl Hall on &quot;Sacred Songs&quot;.

During this period, Fripp began working on solo material, with contributions from poet/lyricist Joanna Walton and several other musicians, including Eno, Gabriel, and Hall (including the latter&#x27;s partner, John Oates), as well as Peter Hammill, Jerry Marotta, Phil Collins, Tony Levin and Terre Roche. This material eventually became his first solo album, &quot;Exposure&quot;, released in 1979, followed by the &quot;Frippertronics&quot; tour in the same year.

While living in New York, Fripp contributed to albums and live performances by Blondie (&quot;Parallel Lines&quot;) and Talking Heads (&quot;Fear of Music&quot;), and produced The Roches&#x27; first and third albums, which featured several of Fripp&#x27;s characteristic guitar solos. A second set of sessions with Bowie produced &quot;Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)&quot;, and he collaborated with Gabriel again on his third solo album. With Blondie, Fripp appeared live on stage at the Hammersmith Odeon on 12 January 1980, participating in a cover version of Bowie&#x27;s Heroes.

In 1980, Fripp would release &quot;God Save the Queen/Under Heavy Manners,&quot; a project that saw two different musical approaches to Frippertronics on one LP. The &quot;A&quot; side of the record, titled &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; attempted what Fripp referred to as &quot;pure Frippertronics&quot; which is &quot;where Frippertronics is used alone.&quot; The &quot;B&quot; side of the record, titled &quot;Under Heavy Manners&quot; featured a collaboration with bassist Busta Jones, drummer Paul Duskin, and David Byrne of Talking Heads (as Absalm el Habib). The sounds of this side of the record featured what Fripp called &quot;Discotronics&quot; which was defined as &quot;that musical experience resulting at the interstice of Frippertronics and disco.&quot;

Concurrent to this, Fripp would assemble what he called a &quot;second-division touring new wave instrumental dance band&quot; under the name League of Gentlemen, with bassist Sara Lee, keyboardist Barry Andrews and drummer Johnny Elichaoff (credited as &quot;Johnny Toobad&quot;). Elichaoff was later replaced by Kevin Wilkinson. The LOG toured for the duration of 1980.

In 1985 he produced the album &quot;Journey to Inaccessible Places&quot; by classical pianist Elan Sicroff, released on the Editions E.G. label.

===1981–1984: Reforming King Crimson===

1981 saw the formation of a new King Crimson lineup, reuniting Fripp with Bruford and opening a new partnership with two American musicians: bassist/Chapman Stick player Tony Levin (who had played with Fripp on &quot;Exposure&quot; and in the first Peter Gabriel touring band) and Adrian Belew, a singer and guitarist who had previously played with Bowie, Talking Heads and Frank Zappa. Although the band had been conceptualised under the name Discipline, it came to Fripp&#x27;s attention that the other members thought the name King Crimson was more appropriate: for Fripp, King Crimson had always been &quot;a way of doing things&quot; rather than a particular group of musicians. With the more pop-inspired Belew as main songwriter (complementing Fripp as main instrumental composer) the band took on a new style incorporating influences from Indonesian gamelan, new wave, and classical minimalism, with both guitarists experimenting extensively with guitar synthesizers. After releasing three albums (&quot;Discipline&quot;, &quot;Beat&quot; and &quot;Three of a Perfect Pair&quot;), Fripp dissolved the band in 1984.

During this period Fripp made two albums with Andy Summers of The Police. On &quot;I Advance Masked&quot;, Fripp and Summers played all the instruments. &quot;Bewitched&quot; was dominated more by Summers, who produced the record and collaborated with other musicians in addition to Fripp.

In 1982 Fripp produced and played guitar on &quot;Keep On Doing&quot; by the Roches. &quot;Village Voice&quot; rock critic Robert Christgau wrote that the album &quot;sounds so good I&#x27;m beginning to believe Robert Fripp was put on earth to produce the Roches.&quot;

===Guitar Craft===
Fripp was offered a teaching position at the American Society for Continuous Education (ASCE) at Claymont Court in Charles Town, West Virginia in 1984. He had been involved with the ASCE since 1978, eventually serving on its board of directors, and had long been considering the idea of teaching guitar through ideas derived from Bennett and Gurdjieff. His course, Guitar Craft, was begun in 1985, an offshoot of which was a performance group, &quot;the League of Crafty Guitarists&quot;, which has released several albums. In 1986, he released the first of two collaborations with his wife, Toyah Willcox. The members of the California Guitar Trio are former members of The League of Crafty Guitarists and have also toured with King Crimson. Fripp is the patron of the Guitar Circle of Europe, which was founded in 2007, and of the Seattle Circle Guitar School, which was founded in 2010.

In February 2009, Fripp recommended that Guitar Craft cease to exist on its 25th anniversary in 2010.

On 1 September 2022 Fripp published &quot;The Guitar Circle&quot;, a book of writings concerning Guitar Craft.

===Soundscapes===

Fripp returned to recording solo in 1994, using an updated version of the Frippertronics technique that creates loops employing digital technology instead of analogue tapes. Fripp has released a number of records that he called &quot;soundscapes&quot;, including &quot;1999&quot;, &quot;Radiophonics&quot;, &quot;A Blessing of Tears&quot;, &quot;That Which Passes&quot;, &quot;November Suite&quot;, &quot;The Gates of Paradise&quot;, &quot;Love Cannot Bear&quot; and &quot;At the End of Time&quot;, as well as numerous download-only live recordings. (The sampler &quot;Pie Jesu&quot; consists of material compiled from &quot;A Blessing of Tears&quot; and &quot;The Gates of Paradise&quot;.)

===1990s collaborations with David Sylvian and others===

Fripp&#x27;s collaborations with David Sylvian feature some of his most exuberant guitar playing. Fripp contributed to Sylvian&#x27;s twenty-minute track &quot;Steel Cathedrals&quot; from his &quot;&quot; album of 1985. Then Fripp performed on several tracks from Sylvian&#x27;s 1986 release, &quot;Gone to Earth&quot;.

In late 1991, Fripp had asked Sylvian to join a re-forming King Crimson as a vocalist. Sylvian declined the invitation, but proposed a possible collaboration between the two that would eventually become a tour of Japan and Italy in the spring of 1992.

Also in 1991, Fripp released an album with the project Sunday All Over The World, also featuring his wife Toyah Willcox, former League of Crafty Guitarists member Trey Gunn on Chapman Stick, and drummer Paul Beavis. The prior name of this band was Fripp Fripp, and they toured as such in 1988. They renamed to SAOTW, and toured again as SAOTW, in 1989.

In July 1993, Sylvian and Fripp released the collaborative effort &quot;The First Day&quot;. Other contributors were soon-to-be King Crimson member Trey Gunn on Chapman Stick and Jerry Marotta (who, like Sylvian, almost became a member of King Crimson) on drums. When the group toured to promote the CD, future King Crimson member Pat Mastelotto took over the drumming spot. The live document &quot;Damage&quot; was released in 1994, as was the joint venture, &quot;Redemption – Approaching Silence&quot;, which featured Sylvian&#x27;s ambient sound sculptures (Approaching Silence) accompanying Fripp reading his own text (Redemption).

During the early and mid-1990s Fripp contributed guitar/soundscapes to &quot;Lifeforms&quot; (1994) by the Future Sound of London and &quot;Cydonia&quot; (released 2001) by the Orb, as well as &quot;FFWD&quot;, a collaborative effort with the latter&#x27;s members. In addition, Fripp worked with Brian Eno co-writing and supplying guitar to two tracks for a CD-ROM project released in 1994 entitled &quot;Headcandy&quot; created by Chris Juul and Doug Jipson. Eno thought the visual aspects of the disc (video feedback effects) were very disappointing upon completion, and regretted participation. During this period, Fripp also contributed to albums by No-Man and the Beloved (1994&#x27;s &quot;Flowermouth&quot; and 1996&#x27;s &quot;X&quot;, respectively). He also contributed soundscapes and guitar to two albums by the UK band Iona: 1993&#x27;s &quot;Beyond These Shores&quot; and 1996&#x27;s &quot;Journey into the Morn&quot;.

===1994–2010: King Crimson redux===

In late 1994, Fripp re-formed the 1981 line-up of King Crimson for its fifth incarnation, adding Trey Gunn and drummer Pat Mastelotto in a configuration known as a &quot;double trio&quot;. This line-up released the &quot;VROOOM&quot; EP in 1994 and the &quot;THRAK&quot; album the following year.

Though musically (and relatively commercially) successful, the double-trio King Crimson proved difficult to sustain in the long-term. From 1997 to 1999, the band &quot;fraKctalised&quot; into five experimental instrumental sub-groups known as ProjeKcts. By 1998 Bruford had quit the band altogether: in 2000, Fripp, Belew, Gunn and Mastelotto reunited as a four-piece King Crimson. This lineup produced two industrial metal-influenced studio albums, &quot;the construKction of light&quot; in 2000 and &quot;The Power to Believe&quot;. Gunn departed at the end of 2003.

Although Levin immediately returned to the band, another hiatus followed until King Crimson reappeared in 2007 with the addition of Porcupine Tree drummer Gavin Harrison. This version of the band toured the eastern United States in 2008, reassessing the 1981-2003 back catalogue and introducing lengthy duets between the two drummers. No new original material was recorded, and in 2010, Fripp announced that King Crimson were on another indefinite hiatus.

===Work with G3, Porcupine Tree, Slow Music, Theo Travis, the Humans and others===
In 2004, Fripp toured with Joe Satriani and Steve Vai as part of their G3 series. He also worked at Microsoft&#x27;s studios to record the startup sound for Windows Vista. Fripp designed the soundscape and composed the melody, while Tucker Martine created the rhythm and Microsoft&#x27;s Steve Ball added the harmonies and created the final arrangement.

In late 2005 and early 2006, Fripp joined R.E.M./Nine Inch Nails drummer Bill Rieflin&#x27;s improvisational Slow Music project, along with R.E.M. guitarist Peter Buck, bassist Fred Chalenor, session drummer Matt Chamberlain and Hector Zazou on electronics. This collective of musicians toured the west coast of America in May 2006.

In 2006 Fripp contributed his composition &quot;At The End Of Time&quot; to the Artists for Charity album &quot;Guitarists 4 the Kids&quot;, produced by Slang Productions, to assist World Vision Canada in helping underprivileged children. Throughout 2006, Fripp performed many solo concerts of soundscapes in intimate settings in churches around England and Estonia. In October 2006, ProjeKct Six (Fripp and Adrian Belew) played at select venues on the east coast of the U.S., opening for Porcupine Tree. In the same year, Fripp contributed to two songs from Porcupine Tree&#x27;s &quot;Fear of a Blank Planet&quot; (&quot;Way Out of Here&quot; and &quot;Nil Recurring&quot;). Fripp also sporadically performed as an opening act for Porcupine Tree on various tours from 2006 through 2009.

In 2008, Fripp collaborated with Theo Travis on an album of guitar and flute-or-saxophone duets called &#x27;Thread&#x27;, and the duo played a brief English tour in 2009 (repeating the collaboration with the &quot;Follow&quot; album in 2012). Also in 2009, Fripp played a concert with the band the Humans (which consists of his wife Toyah Willcox, Bill Rieflin and Chris Wong), appeared on Judy Dyble&#x27;s &quot;Talking With Strangers&quot; (along with Pat Mastelotto and others) and played on two tracks on Jakko Jakszyk&#x27;s album &quot;The Bruised Romantic Glee Club&quot;. In 2010, Fripp contributed a guitar solo to an extended version of the song &#x27;Heathen Child&#x27; by Grinderman, released as a B-side on the &#x27;Super Heathen Child&#x27; single.

In 2021, the ambient/electronica album Leviathan was released. Fripp produced it and played guitar, in collaboration with British EDM Duo The Grid.

===&quot;A Scarcity of Miracles&quot;, musical &#x27;retirement&#x27; and new lineup of King Crimson===

In May 2011, Jakko Jakszyk, Robert Fripp and Mel Collins released &quot;A Scarcity of Miracles: A King Crimson ProjeKct&quot; on the Panegyric label. The album also featured contributions by Tony Levin and Gavin Harrison, leading to speculation that the project was a dry run for a new King Crimson lineup.

In an interview published 3 August 2012, Fripp stated that he had retired from working as a professional musician, citing long-standing differences with Universal Music Group and stating that working within the music industry had become &quot;a joyless exercise in futility&quot;. This retirement proved to be short-lived, only lasting as long as it took to come to a settlement with UMG.

In his online diary entry for 6 September 2013, Fripp announced the return of King Crimson as a seven-piece unit with &quot;four Englishmen and three Americans&quot;. The new lineup was Fripp, Levin, both Mastelotto and Harrison on drums, returning 1970s band member Mel Collins and two new members: Jakko Jakszyk as singer and second guitarist, and Bill Rieflin as a third drummer. This version of the band went on tour in 2014 and 2015 with a setlist reworking and reconfiguring the band&#x27;s 1960s and 1970s material (plus songs from &quot;A Scarcity of Miracles&quot; and new compositions). In early 2016, it was announced that former Lemon Trees/Noel Gallagher drummer Jeremy Stacey would substitute for Rieflin on that year&#x27;s tour while the latter was on sabbatical. King Crimson continued touring as a seven- or eight-piece unit with Stacey as a permanent member on drums and keyboards, plus Rieflin (when available) on keyboards and &quot;fairy dusting&quot; until 2021. Rieflin last played with Crimson in 2018; he died 24 March 2020.

==Equipment==
During the early years of King Crimson (1968–74), Fripp used two Gibson Les Paul guitars from 1957 and 1959. The &#x27;57 guitar featured three humbucker pick-ups (with one volume control on the pickguard controlling the middle pick-up). In the band&#x27;s 1980s era, he favoured Roland GR-303 &amp; GR-808 guitars for both straight guitar and synth control. In subsequent years, Fripp has used customized Les Paul-style guitars by Tokai, 48th St Custom, and Fernandes.

A signature model named for the guitarist (Crimson Guitars Robert Fripp Signature) features Fernandes Sustainer and MIDI pickups with a Les Paul-style body. A significant difference from the Gibson Les Paul is that the signature model is built using a deep set neck tenon rather than a traditional set neck.

Fripp recommended that Guitar Craft students adopt the Ovation 1867 Legend steel-string acoustic guitar. &quot;Fripp liked the way the Ovation 1867 fitted against his body, which made it possible for him to assume the right-arm picking position he had developed using electric guitars over the years; on deeper-bodied guitars, the Frippian arm position is impossible without uncomfortable contortions&quot;, according to Tamm. While the 1867 Legend is no longer manufactured, it influenced the design of the Guitar Craft Pro Model of Guitar Craft Guitars, which has been endorsed by Fripp.

==Guitar technique==
Fripp began playing guitar at the age of eleven. When he started, he was tone deaf and had no rhythmic sense, weaknesses which led him later to comment that &quot;Music so wishes to be heard that it sometimes calls on unlikely characters to give it voice.&quot; He was also naturally left-handed but opted to play the guitar right-handed.

While being taught guitar basics by his teacher Don Strike, Fripp began to develop the technique of crosspicking, which became one of his specialities. Fripp teaches crosspicking to his students in Guitar Craft.

In 1985, Fripp began using a tuning he called &quot;New Standard Tuning&quot; (C2-G2-D3-A3-E4-G4), which would also become popularised in Guitar Craft.

Fripp&#x27;s guitar technique, unlike most rock guitarists of his era, is not blues-based but rather influenced by avant-garde jazz and European classical music. He combines rapid alternate picking and crosspicking with motifs employing whole-tone or diminished pitch structures and extended sixteenth-note patterns in &quot;moto perpetuo&quot;.

Rather than stand when performing, he seats himself on a stool (unusual for a performer in rock music), and by doing so was called in a May 1974 issue of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; &quot;the guitarist who sits on stage&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Fripp married singer and actress Toyah Willcox on 16 May 1986 in Poole. From December 1987 until July 1999 they lived at and renovated Reddish House, the former home of Cecil Beaton, in the village of Broad Chalke in Wiltshire.

Fripp previously lived at Thornhill Cottage, Holt, Dorset (1971–1980) and Fernhill House, Witchampton (1980–1987). After Reddish House, the couple lived at Evershot Old Mansion (1999–2001). They then moved to their present home in Pershore, Worcestershire. The couple have no children and have arranged their will so as to leave their assets to the establishment of a musical educational trust for children.

Fripp is the patron of the Seattle Circle Guitar School in the United States and the Shallal Dance Theatre in Penzance. He also has had engagements as a motivational speaker, often at events with his sister Patricia, who is a keynote speaker and speech coach.

Alfie Fripp, the last of the &quot;39ers&quot;, shot down by the Luftwaffe and then held in 12 different POW camps during World War II, was his uncle.

Fripp is a pescetarian. Nevill Drury details in &quot;Music for Inner Space: Techniques for Meditation &amp; Visualisation&quot; that Fripp was interested in the Hermetic Qabalah, Wicca, German Renaissance philosopher Paracelsus, and George Gurdjieff via J. G. Bennett.

During the COVID-19 lockdowns, Fripp and Willcox uploaded many short, humorous videos to YouTube, usually covers of well-known songs, and mostly titled &quot;Toyah and Robert&#x27;s Sunday Lunch&quot;. According to rock and metal news website MetalSucks, their stories about these covers were extremely popular; their cover of Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; was the site&#x27;s sixth-most popular story that year. The duo toured the UK in 2023, performing the &quot;Sunday Lunch&quot; songs in concert.

== Awards and honours ==
Asteroid 81947 Fripp, discovered by Marc Buie at Cerro Tololo in 2000, was named in his honour. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 18 May 2019 ().

Fripp is ranked 62nd on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2011 list of the 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time, having been ranked 42nd by David Fricke on its 2003 list. Tied with Andrés Segovia, he is ranked 47th on Gibson&#x27;s Top 50 guitarists of all time.

==Discipline Global Mobile==

In 1992, Fripp and producer/online content developer David Singleton co-founded Discipline Global Mobile (DGM) as an independent music label. DGM releases music by Fripp, KC, related acts, and other artists in CDs and in downloadable files. A 1998 &quot;Billboard&quot; profile stated that DGM had ten staff-members in Salisbury (England) and Los Angeles (USA). DGM has an aim &quot;to be a model of ethical business in an industry founded on exploitation, oiled by deceit, riven with theft and fueled by greed.&quot; DGM insists that its artists retain all copyrights; consequently, even DGM&#x27;s &quot;knotwork&quot; corporate-logo &quot;(pictured above)&quot; is owned by its designer, Steve Ball; the &quot;knotwork&quot; logo appeared earlier on the cover of later versions of the &quot;Discipline&quot; album. DGM&#x27;s aims were called &quot;exemplary&quot; by Bill , who wrote that &quot;Fripp has done something very important for the possibilities of experimental music&quot; in creating DGM, which &quot;has played a major role in creating favorable conditions for&quot; King Crimson.

DGM publishes an on-line diary by Fripp, who often comments on performances and on relations with fans. A moderated forum allows fans to ask questions or to leave comments. Together, Fripp&#x27;s diary and the fan forum display delayed dialogs in which Fripp and fans discuss diary-entries and forum-postings.

===Copyright infringement complaints===
In 2009, Fripp released a statement claiming that EMI &amp; Sanctuary Universal had uploaded music to various music stores without his consent, stating &quot;NONE of these downloads were licensed, authorised or legitimised. that is, every single download of any KC track represents copyright violation. or, to use one syllable instead of seven, theft.&quot;

In 2011, Fripp complained that the streaming service Grooveshark continued to stream his music despite his having delivered repeated takedown notices. Fripp and Grooveshark&#x27;s correspondence was published by &quot;Digital Music News&quot; and in his diaries, which appear on the website of Discipline Global Mobile.

Fripp&#x27;s published exchange was included in a suit against Grooveshark by Universal Music Group, which was filed in November 2011. UMG cited internal documents revealing that Grooveshark employees uploaded thousands of illegal copies of UMG-owned recordings. Fripp had previous experience protecting his music in litigation with music companies. 

Fripp has stated that he believes &quot;Unauthorised streaming or MP3 giveaways – it amounts to the same thing – copyright theft.&quot;

==Discography==
Fripp has been extremely active as a recording musician and a producer. He has contributed to more than 700 official releases. The Robert Fripp Discography Summary, compiled by John Relph, also lists 120 compilations and 315 unauthorised releases (such as bootlegs). This means that more than 1100 releases (including both official and unofficial ones, as well as both studio and live recordings) can be found with Fripp participating.

<doc id="25894" wikidata="Q504677" url="?curid=25894" title="Robert Zubrin">
<text>Robert Zubrin (; born April 9, 1952) is an American aerospace engineer, author, and advocate for human exploration of Mars. He is also an advocate for U.S. space superiority, writing that &quot;in the 21st century, victory on land, sea or in the air will go to the power that controls space&quot; and that &quot;if we desire peace on Earth, we need to prepare for war in space.&quot;

He and his colleague at Martin Marietta, David Baker, were the driving force behind Mars Direct, a proposal in a 1990 research paper intended to produce significant reductions in the cost and complexity of such a mission. The key idea was to use the Martian atmosphere to produce oxygen, water, and rocket propellant for the surface stay and return journey. A modified version of the plan was subsequently adopted by NASA as their &quot;design reference mission&quot;. He questions the delay and cost-to-benefit ratio of first establishing a base or outpost on an asteroid or another Apollo program-like return to the Moon, as neither would be able to provide all of its own oxygen, water, or energy; these resources are producible on Mars, and he expects people would be there thereafter.

Disappointed with the lack of interest from government in Mars exploration and after the success of his book &quot;The Case for Mars&quot; (1996), as well as leadership experience at the National Space Society, Zubrin established the Mars Society in 1998. This is an international organization advocating a human mission to Mars as a goal, by private funding if possible.

== Early life==
Zubrin was born in Brooklyn, New York City on April 9, 1952. His father was descended from Russian Jewish immigrants.

==Career ==
Zubrin was awarded his first patent at age 20 in 1972 for Three Player Chess.

Zubrin holds a B.A. in Mathematics from the University of Rochester (1974); he was a science teacher for 7 years before becoming an engineer. He earned a M.S. in Nuclear Engineering (1984), a M.S. in Aeronautics and Astronautics (1986), and a Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering (1992) — all from the University of Washington. He has developed a number of concepts for space propulsion and exploration, and is the author of over 200 technical and non-technical papers and several books. He is also President of both the Mars Society and Pioneer Astronautics, a private company that does research and development on innovative aerospace technologies. Zubrin is the co-inventor on a U.S. design patent and a U.S. utility patent on a hybrid rocket/airplane, and on a U.S. utility patent on an oxygen supply system (see links below).

Zubrin&#x27;s inventions include the nuclear salt-water rocket and co-inventor (with Dana Andrews) of the magnetic sail. Zubrin is fellow at Center for Security Policy.

During his professional career, Zubrin was a member of Lockheed Martin&#x27;s scenario development team charged with developing strategies for space exploration. He was also &quot;a senior engineer with the Martin Marietta Astronautics company, working as one of its leaders in development of advanced concepts for interplanetary missions&quot;. During his time at Martin Marietta, he drafted ideas for a potential single-stage-to-orbit spacecraft, and developed the Black Colt. However, he would eventually leave Martin Marietta to co-form Pioneer Rocketplane with Mitchell Burnside Clapp, an aerospace engineer from the US Air Force, due to a perceived lack of interest in reducing launch costs at larger aerospace firms. In his book, &quot;Entering Space: Creating a Spacefaring Civilization&quot;, Zubrin would write about how both large aerospace firms, and the US Government, would fail to reduce the costs of spaceflight.

In 1998, Zubrin founded the Mars Society, and in the following years, was able to attract large amounts of public interest to potential human colonisation on Mars. The work of the Mars Society was successful enough as to encourage the US Government to not cut funding for several Mars rover missions. 

===Pioneer Astronautics===
In 1996 Zubrin founded Pioneer Astronautics (formerly Pioneer Invention), a research and development company committed to developing innovative technologies to further space exploration and improve life on earth. The company relied primarily on small business research contracts and tackled a large variety of space-relevant problems.

On 13 July 2020 Voyager Space Holdings announced its acquisition of Pioneer Astronautics.

===Pioneer Energy===
In 2008 Zubrin founded Pioneer Energy, a research and development firm headquartered in Lakewood, Colorado. The company&#x27;s focus is to develop mobile Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) systems that can enable -based EOR for both small and large oil producers in the United States. The company has also developed a number of new processes for manufacturing synthetic fuels.

== The ethics of terraforming ==

Zubrin is known as an advocate of a moderately anthropocentric position in the ethics of terraforming. Discussions of the ethics of terraforming often make reference to a series of public debates Zubrin has held with his friend Christopher McKay, who advocates a moderately biocentric position on the ethics of terraforming. For example, a written account of some of these debates is available in &quot;On to Mars: Colonizing a New World&quot;, as a joint article, &quot;Do indigenous Martian bacteria have precedence over human exploration?&quot; (pp. 177–182)

== Cultural references ==
An aged Robert Zubrin also appears as a background character in &quot;The Martian Race&quot; (1999) by Gregory Benford, a science fiction novel depicting early human explorers on Mars in the very near future. Benford, who is also an astrophysicist, is a longtime member of both the board of directors and the steering committee of the Mars Society.

In Martin Burckhardt&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Score&quot;, the Mars Expedition Astronauts send 90-year-old Robert Zubrin a video reply thanking him for his work over the years after receiving a congratulatory one from him for their successful landing on Mars.

Zubrin was featured in a 2007 CBC News documentary special, &quot;The Passionate Eye&quot;, titled &quot;The Mars Underground&quot;.

The songwriter and musician Frank Black (alias Black Francis of the Pixies) penned an homage to Zubrin, &quot;Robert Onion&quot;, on the album &quot;Dog in the Sand&quot;. The lyrics are in the form of an acrostic, spelling &quot;Robert The Case for Mars Zubrin&quot;.

In 2010 Robert Zubrin was featured in the Symphony of Science video &quot;The Case for Mars&quot; along with Carl Sagan, Brian Cox, and Penelope Boston.

The fictional character Dr. Zachary Walzer in the 2010–2011 independent VODO series &quot;Pioneer One&quot; was inspired by Zubrin.

In 2016, Zubrin was one of several scientists and engineers interviewed in the National Geographic miniseries &quot;Mars&quot;.
