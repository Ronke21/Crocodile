<text>Radical feminism is a perspective within feminism that calls for a radical re-ordering of society in which male supremacy is eliminated in all social and economic contexts, while recognizing that women&#x27;s experiences are also affected by other social divisions such as in race, class, and sexual orientation. The ideology and movement emerged in the 1960s.

Radical feminists view society fundamentally as a patriarchy in which men dominate and oppress women. Radical feminists seek to abolish the patriarchy in a struggle to liberate women and girls from an unjust society by challenging existing social norms and institutions. This struggle includes opposing the sexual objectification of women, raising public awareness about such issues as rape and other violence against women, challenging the concept of gender roles, and challenging what radical feminists see as a racialized and gendered capitalism that characterizes the United States, the United Kingdom, and many other countries. According to Shulamith Firestone in &quot;The Dialectic of Sex&quot; (1970): &quot;[T]he end goal of feminist revolution must be, unlike that of the first feminist movement, not just the elimination of male &quot;privilege&quot; but of the sex &quot;distinction&quot; itself: genital differences between human beings would no longer matter culturally.&quot; While radical feminists believe that differences in genitalia and secondary sex characteristics should not matter culturally or politically, they also maintain that women&#x27;s special role in reproduction should be recognized and accommodated without penalty in the workplace, and some have argued compensation should be offered for this socially essential work.

Radical feminists locate the root cause of women&#x27;s oppression in patriarchal gender relations, as opposed to legal systems (as in liberal feminism) or class conflict (as in Marxist feminism). Early radical feminism, arising within second-wave feminism in the 1960s, typically viewed patriarchy as a &quot;transhistorical phenomenon&quot; prior to or deeper than other sources of oppression, &quot;not only the oldest and most universal form of domination but the primary form&quot; and the model for all others. Later politics derived from radical feminism ranged from cultural feminism to syncretic forms of socialist feminism (such as anarcha-feminism) that place issues of social class, economics, and the like on a par with patriarchy as sources of oppression.

== Theory and ideology ==
Radical feminists assert that global society functions as a patriarchy in which the class of men are the oppressors of the class of women. They propose that the oppression of women is the most fundamental form of oppression, one that has existed since the inception of humanity. As radical feminist Ti-Grace Atkinson wrote in her foundational piece &quot;Radical Feminism&quot; (1969):

The first dichotomous division of this mass [mankind] is said to have been on the grounds of sex: male and female ... it was because half the human race bears the burden of the reproductive process and because man, the &#x27;rational&#x27; animal, had the wit to take advantage of that, that the childbearers, or the &#x27;beasts of burden,&#x27; were corralled into a political class: equivocating the biologically contingent burden into a political (or necessary) penalty, thereby modifying these individuals&#x27; definition from the human to the functional, or animal.
Radical feminists argue that, because of patriarchy, women have come to be viewed as the &quot;other&quot; to the male norm, and as such have been systematically oppressed and marginalized. They further assert that men, as a class, benefit from the systematic oppression of women. Patriarchal theory is not defined by a belief that all men always benefit from the oppression of all women. Rather, it maintains that the primary element of patriarchy is a relationship of dominance, where one party is dominant and exploits the other for the benefit of the former. Radical feminists believe that men (as a class) use social systems and other methods of control to keep women (as well as non-dominant men) suppressed. Radical feminists seek to abolish patriarchy by challenging existing social norms and institutions, and believe that eliminating patriarchy will liberate everyone from an unjust society. Ti-Grace Atkinson maintained that the need for power fuels the male class to continue oppressing the female class, arguing that &quot;the &quot;need&quot; men have for the role of oppressor is the source and foundation of all human oppression&quot;.

The influence of radical-feminist politics on the women&#x27;s liberation movement was considerable. Redstockings co-founder Ellen Willis wrote in 1984 that radical feminists &quot;got sexual politics recognized as a public issue&quot;, created second-wave feminism&#x27;s vocabulary, helped to legalize abortion in the US, &quot;were the first to demand total equality in the so-called private sphere&quot; (&quot;housework and child care ... emotional and sexual needs&quot;), and &quot;created the atmosphere of urgency&quot; that almost led to the passage of the Equal Rights Amendment. The influence of radical feminism can be seen in the adoption of these issues by the National Organization for Women (NOW), a feminist group that had previously been focused almost entirely on economic issues.

== Movement ==
=== Roots ===
Radical feminists in the United States coined the term women&#x27;s liberation movement (WLM). The WLM grew largely due to the influence of the civil rights movement, that had gained momentum in the 1960s, and many of the women who took up the cause of radical feminism had previous experience with radical protest in the struggle against racism. Chronologically, it can be seen within the context of second wave feminism that started in the early 1960s. The leading figures of this second wave of feminism included Shulamith Firestone, Kathie Sarachild, Ti-Grace Atkinson, Carol Hanisch, Roxanne Dunbar, Naomi Weisstein and Judith Brown. In the late sixties various women&#x27;s groups describing themselves as &quot;radical feminist&quot;, such as the UCLA Women&#x27;s Liberation Front (WLF), offered differing views of radical feminist ideology. UCLA&#x27;s WLF co-founder Devra Weber recalls, &quot;the radical feminists were opposed to patriarchy, but not necessarily capitalism. In our group at least, they opposed so-called male dominated national liberation struggles&quot;.

Radical feminists helped to translate the radical protest for racial equality, in which many had experience, over to the struggle for women&#x27;s rights. They took up the cause and advocated for a variety of women&#x27;s issues, including abortion rights, the Equal Rights Amendment, access to credit, and equal pay. Many women of color were among the founders of the Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement (Fran Beal, Cellestine Ware, Toni Cade Bambara); however, many women of color did not participate in the movement due to their conclusion that radical feminists were not addressing &quot;issues of meaning for minority women&quot;, Black women in particular. After consciousness raising groups were formed to rally support, second-wave radical feminism began to see an increasing number of women of color participating.

In the 1960s, radical feminism emerged within liberal feminist and working-class feminist discussions, first in the United States, then in the United Kingdom and Australia. Those involved had gradually come to believe that it was not only the middle-class nuclear family that oppressed women, but that it was also social movements and organizations that claimed to stand for human liberation, notably the counterculture, the New Left, and Marxist political parties, all of which were male-dominated and male-oriented. In the United States, radical feminism developed as a response to some of the perceived failings of both New Left organizations such as the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and feminist organizations such as NOW. Initially concentrated in big cities like New York, Chicago, Boston, Washington, DC, and on the West Coast, radical feminist groups spread across the country rapidly from 1968 to 1972.

At the same time parallel trends of thinking developed outside the USA: The Women&#x27;s Yearbook from Munich gives a good sense of early 1970s feminism in West Germany:

Radical feminists introduced the use of consciousness raising (CR) groups. These groups brought together intellectuals, workers, and middle-class women in developed Western countries to discuss their experiences. During these discussions, women noted a shared and repressive system regardless of their political affiliation or social class. Based on these discussions, the women drew the conclusion that ending of patriarchy was the most necessary step towards a truly free society. These consciousness-raising sessions allowed early radical feminists to develop a political ideology based on common experiences women faced with male supremacy. Consciousness raising was extensively used in chapter sub-units of the National Organization for Women (NOW) during the 1970s. The feminism that emerged from these discussions stood first and foremost for the liberation of women, as women, from the oppression of men in their own lives, as well as men in power. Radical feminism claimed that a totalizing ideology and social formation—&quot;patriarchy&quot; (government or rule by fathers)—dominated women in the interests of men.

===Groups===
Within groups such as New York Radical Women (1967–1969; not connected to the present-day socialist feminist organization Radical Women), which Ellen Willis characterized as &quot;the first women&#x27;s liberation group in New York City&quot;, a radical feminist ideology began to emerge. It declared that &quot;the personal is political&quot; and the &quot;sisterhood is powerful&quot;; calls to women&#x27;s activism coined by Kathie Sarachild and others in the group. New York Radical Women fell apart in early 1969 in what came to be known as the &quot;politico-feminist split&quot;, with the &quot;politicos&quot; seeing capitalism as the main source of women&#x27;s oppression, while the &quot;feminists&quot; saw women&#x27;s oppression in a male supremacy that was &quot;a set of material, institutionalized relations, not just bad attitudes&quot;. The feminist side of the split, whose members referred to themselves as &quot;radical feminists&quot;, soon constituted the basis of a new organization, Redstockings. At the same time, Ti-Grace Atkinson led &quot;a radical split-off from NOW&quot;, which became known as The Feminists. A third major stance would be articulated by the New York Radical Feminists, founded later in 1969 by Shulamith Firestone (who broke from the Redstockings) and Anne Koedt.

During this period, the movement produced &quot;a prodigious output of leaflets, pamphlets, journals, magazine articles, newspaper and radio and TV interviews&quot;. Many important feminist works, such as Koedt&#x27;s essay &quot;The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm&quot; (1970) and Kate Millett&#x27;s book &quot;Sexual Politics&quot; (1970), emerged during this time and in this milieu.

=== Ideology emerges and diverges ===
At the beginning of this period, &quot;heterosexuality was more or less an unchallenged assumption&quot;. Among radical feminists, it was widely held that, thus far, the sexual freedoms gained in the sexual revolution of the 1960s, in particular, the decreasing emphasis on monogamy, had been largely gained by men at women&#x27;s expense. This assumption of heterosexuality would soon be challenged by the rise of political lesbianism, closely associated with Atkinson and The Feminists.

Redstockings and The Feminists were both radical feminist organizations, but held rather distinct views. Most members of Redstockings held to a materialist and anti-psychologistic view. They viewed men&#x27;s oppression of women as ongoing and deliberate, holding individual men responsible for this oppression, viewing institutions and systems (including the family) as mere vehicles of conscious male intent, and rejecting psychologistic explanations of female submissiveness as blaming women for collaboration in their own oppression. They held to a view—which Willis would later describe as &quot;neo-Maoist&quot;—that it would be possible to unite all or virtually all women, as a class, to confront this oppression by personally confronting men.

The Feminists held a more idealistic, psychologistic, and utopian philosophy, with a greater emphasis on &quot;sex roles&quot;, seeing sexism as rooted in &quot;complementary patterns of male and female behavior&quot;. They placed more emphasis on institutions, seeing marriage, family, prostitution, and heterosexuality as all existing to perpetuate the &quot;sex-role system&quot;. They saw all of these as institutions to be destroyed. Within the group, there were further disagreements, such as Koedt&#x27;s viewing the institution of &quot;normal&quot; sexual intercourse as being focused mainly on male sexual or erotic pleasure, while Atkinson viewed it mainly in terms of reproduction. In contrast to the Redstockings, The Feminists generally considered genitally focused sexuality to be inherently male. Ellen Willis, the Redstockings co-founder, would later write that insofar as the Redstockings considered abandoning heterosexual activity, they saw it as a &quot;bitter price&quot; they &quot;might have to pay for [their] militance&quot;, whereas The Feminists embraced separatist feminism as a strategy.

The New York Radical Feminists (NYRF) took a more psychologistic (and even biologically determinist) line. They argued that men dominated women not so much for material benefits as for the ego satisfaction intrinsic in domination. Similarly, they rejected the Redstockings view that women submitted only out of necessity or The Feminists&#x27; implicit view that they submitted out of cowardice, but instead argued that social conditioning simply led most women to accept a submissive role as &quot;right and natural&quot;.

=== Forms of action ===
The radical feminism of the late 1960s was not only a movement of ideology and theory; it helped to inspire direct action. In 1968, feminists protested against the Miss America pageant in order to bring &quot;sexist beauty ideas and social expectations&quot; to the forefront of women&#x27;s social issues. Even though bras were not burned on that day, the protest led to the phrase &quot;bra-burner&quot;. &quot;Feminists threw their bras—along with &quot;woman-garbage&quot; such as girdles, false eyelashes, steno pads, wigs, women&#x27;s magazines, and dishcloths—into a &quot;Freedom Trash Can&quot;, but they did not set it on fire&quot;. In March 1970, more than one hundred feminists staged an 11-hour sit-in at the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; headquarters. These women demanded that the publication replace its male editor with a female editor, and accused the &quot;Ladies Home Journal&quot;, &quot;with their emphasis on food, family, fashion, and femininity&quot;, of being &quot;instruments of women&#x27;s oppression&quot;. One protester explained the goal of the protest by saying that they &quot;were there to destroy a publication which feeds off of women&#x27;s anger and frustration, a magazine which destroys women.&quot;

Radical feminists used a variety of tactics, including demonstrations, speakouts, and community and work-related organizing, to gain exposure and adherents. In France and West Germany, radical feminists developed further forms of direct action.

==== Self-incrimination ====
On 6 June 1971 the cover of &quot;Stern&quot; showed 28 German actresses and journalists confessing &quot;We Had an Abortion!&quot; () unleashing a campaign against the abortion ban. The journalist Alice Schwarzer had organized this avowal form of protest following a French example.

In 1974, Schwarzer persuaded 329 doctors to publicly admit in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; to having performed abortions. She also found a woman willing to terminate her pregnancy on camera with vacuum aspiration, thereby promoting this method of abortion by showing it on the German political television program &quot;Panorama&quot;. Cristina Perincioli described this as &quot;... a new tactic: the ostentatious, publicly documented violation of a law that millions of women had broken thus far, only in secret and under undignified circumstances.&quot; However, with strong opposition from church groups and most of the broadcasting councils governing West Germany&#x27;s ARD (association of public broadcasters), the film was not aired. Instead Panorama&#x27;s producers replaced the time slot with a statement of protest and the display of an empty studio.

==== Circumventing the abortion ban ====
In the 1970s, radical women&#x27;s centers without a formal hierarchy sprang up in West Berlin. These Berlin-based women&#x27;s centers did abortion counseling, compiled a list of Dutch abortion clinics, organized regular bus trips to them, and were utilized by women from other parts of West Germany. Police accused the organizers of an illegal conspiracy. &quot;The center used these arrests to publicize its strategy of civil disobedience and raised such a public outcry that the prosecutions were dropped. The bus trips continued without police interference. This victory was politically significant in two respects... while the state did not change the law, it did back off from enforcing it, deferring to women&#x27;s collective power. The feminist claim to speak for women was thus affirmed by both women and the state.&quot;

==== Leaving the Church ====
In West Germany, 1973 saw the start of a radical feminist group campaign to withdraw from membership in the Catholic Church as a protest against its anti-abortion position and activities. &quot;Can we continue to be responsible for funding a male institution that ... condemns us as ever to the house, to cooking and having children, but above all to having children&quot;. In Germany those baptized in one of the officially recognized churches have to document that they have formally left the church in order not to be responsible for paying a church tax.

====Protest of biased coverage of lesbians====
In November 1972, two women in a sexual relationship, Marion Ihns and Judy Andersen, were arrested and charged with hiring a man to kill Ihns&#x27;s abusive husband. Pretrial publicity, particularly that by &quot;Bild&quot;, Germany&#x27;s largest tabloid, was marked by anti-lesbian sensationalism. In response, lesbian groups and women&#x27;s centers in Germany joined in fervent protest. The cultural clash continued through the trial which eventually resulted in the conviction of the women in October 1974 and life sentences for both. However, a petition brought by 146 female journalists and 41 male colleagues to the German Press Council resulted in its censure of the Axel Springer Company, &quot;Bild&quot;&#x27;s publisher. At one point in the lead up to the trial &quot;Bild&quot; had run a seventeen consecutive day series on &quot;The Crimes of Lesbian Women&quot;.

==== Genital self-exams ====
These helped women to gain knowledge about how their own bodies functioned so they would no longer need to rely solely on the medical profession. An outgrowth of this movement was the founding of the (FFGZ) in Berlin in 1974. 

=== Social organization and aims ===
Radical feminists have generally formed small activist or community associations around either consciousness raising or concrete aims. Many radical feminists in Australia participated in a series of squats to establish various women&#x27;s centers, and this form of action was common in the late 1970s and early 1980s. By the mid-1980s many of the original consciousness raising groups had dissolved, and radical feminism was more and more associated with loosely organized university collectives. Radical feminism can still be seen, particularly within student activism and among working-class women. In Australia, many feminist social organizations had accepted government funding during the 1980s, and the election of a conservative government in 1996 crippled these organizations. A radical feminist movement also emerged among Jewish women in Israel beginning in the early 1970s.

While radical feminists aim to dismantle patriarchal society, their immediate aims are generally concrete. Common demands include expanding reproductive rights. According to writer Lisa Tuttle in &quot;The Encyclopedia of Feminism&quot; it was &quot;defined by feminists in the 1970s as a basic human right, it includes the right to abortion and birth control, but implies much more. To be realised, reproductive freedom must include not only a woman&#x27;s right to choose childbirth, abortion, sterilisation or birth control, but also her right to make those choices freely, without pressure from individual men, doctors, governmental or religious authorities. It is a key issue for women, since without it the other freedoms we appear to have, such as the right to education, jobs and equal pay, may prove illusory. Provisions of childcare, medical treatment, and society&#x27;s attitude towards children are also involved.&quot;

==Views on the sex industry==
Radical feminists have written about a wide range of issues regarding the sex industry—which they tend to oppose—including but not limited to what many see as: the harm done to women during the production of pornography, the social harm from consumption of pornography, the coercion and poverty that leads women to become prostitutes, the long-term detrimental effects of prostitution, the raced and classed nature of prostitution, and male dominance over women in prostitution and pornography.

Feminists who oppose the acceptance and endorsement of prostitution by rebranding it as &quot;sex work&quot; are sometimes disparagingly labeled as &quot;sex worker-exclusionary radical feminists&quot; or &quot;SWERFs&quot;. These argue that the term &quot;sex work&quot; contains political assumptions, rather than being a neutral term. They argue the term endorses the idea that sex is labour for women and leisure for men, according men the social and economic power to act as a ruling class in the matter of intercourse, and also implies that women&#x27;s bodies exist as a resource to be used by other people.

===Prostitution===
Radical feminists argue that most women who become prostitutes are forced into it by a pimp, human trafficking, poverty, drug addiction, or trauma such as child sexual abuse. Women from the lowest socioeconomic classes—impoverished women, women with a low level of education, women from the most disadvantaged racial and ethnic minorities—are over-represented in prostitution all over the world. Catharine MacKinnon asked: &quot;If prostitution is a free choice, why are the women with the fewest choices the ones most often found doing it?&quot; Radical feminist Melissa Farley conducted a 2004 study of 854 people involved in prostitution internationally, finding that 89% of respondents stated they wanted to escape prostitution but could not, 72% were currently or formerly homeless, and 68% met criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder.

MacKinnon argues that &quot;In prostitution, women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with. The money thus acts as a form of force, not as a measure of consent. It acts like physical force does in rape.&quot; They believe that no person can be said to truly consent to their own oppression and no-one should have the right to consent to the oppression of others. Kathleen Barry argues that consent is not a &quot;good divining rod as to the existence of oppression, and consent to violation is a fact of oppression&quot;. Andrea Dworkin wrote in 1992:

Dworkin argued that &quot;prostitution and equality for women cannot exist simultaneously&quot; and to eradicate prostitution &quot;we must seek ways to use words and law to end the abusive selling and buying of girls&#x27; and women&#x27;s bodies for men&#x27;s sexual pleasure&quot;.

Radical feminist thinking has analyzed prostitution as a cornerstone of patriarchal domination and sexual subjugation of women that impacts negatively not only on the women and girls in prostitution but on all women as a group, because prostitution continually affirms and reinforces patriarchal definitions of women as having a primary function to serve men sexually. They say it is crucial that society does not replace one patriarchal view on female sexuality—that women should not have sex/a relationship outside marriage and that casual sex is shameful for a woman—with another similarly oppressive and patriarchal view—acceptance of prostitution, a sexual practice based on a highly patriarchal construct of sexuality: that the sexual pleasure of a woman is irrelevant, that her only role during sex is to submit to the man&#x27;s sexual demands and to do what he tells her, that sex should be controlled by the man, and that the woman&#x27;s response and satisfaction are irrelevant. Radical feminists argue that sexual liberation for women cannot be achieved so long as we normalize unequal sexual practices where a man dominates a woman. &quot;Feminist consciousness raising remains the foundation for collective struggle and the eventual liberation of women&quot;.

Radical feminists strongly object to the patriarchal ideology that has been one of the justifications for the existence of prostitution, namely that prostitution is a &quot;necessary evil&quot;, because men cannot control themselves, and that it is therefore &quot;necessary&quot; that a small number of women be &quot;sacrificed&quot; to be abused by men, to protect &quot;chaste&quot; women from rape and harassment. These feminists argue that far from decreasing rape rates, prostitution actually leads to an increase in sexual violence against women, by sending the message that it is acceptable for a man to treat a woman as a sexual instrument over which he has total control. For instance, Melissa Farley argues that Nevada&#x27;s high rate of rapes is exacerbated by the patriarchal atmosphere encouraged by legal prostitution.

Indigenous women are particularly targeted for prostitution. In Canada, New Zealand, Mexico, and Taiwan, studies have shown that indigenous women are at the bottom of the race and class hierarchy of prostitution, often subjected to the worst conditions, most violent demands and sold at the lowest price. It is common for indigenous women to be over-represented in prostitution when compared with their total population. This is as a result of the combined forces of colonialism, physical displacement from ancestral lands, destruction of indigenous social and cultural order, misogyny, globalization/neoliberalism, race discrimination and extremely high levels of violence perpetrated against them.

===Pornography===

Radical feminists, notably Catharine MacKinnon, charge that the production of pornography entails physical, psychological, and/or economic coercion of the women who perform and model in it. This is said to be true even when the women are presented as enjoying themselves.

Radical feminists point to the testimony of well-known participants in pornography, such as Traci Lords and Linda Boreman, and argue that most female performers are coerced into pornography, either by somebody else or by an unfortunate set of circumstances. The feminist anti-pornography movement was galvanized by the publication of &quot;Ordeal&quot;, in which Linda Boreman (who under the name of &quot;Linda Lovelace&quot; had starred in &quot;Deep Throat&quot;) stated that she had been beaten, raped, and pimped by her husband Chuck Traynor, and that Traynor had forced her at gunpoint to make scenes in &quot;Deep Throat&quot;, as well as forcing her, by use of both physical violence against Boreman as well as emotional abuse and outright threats of violence, to make other pornographic films. Dworkin, MacKinnon, and Women Against Pornography issued public statements of support for Boreman, and worked with her in public appearances and speeches. She later became a born-again Christian and a spokeswoman for the anti-pornography movement.

Radical feminists hold the view that pornography contributes to sexism, arguing that in pornographic performances the actresses are reduced to mere receptacles—objects—for sexual use and abuse by men. They argue that the narrative is usually formed around men&#x27;s pleasure as the only goal of sexual activity, and that the women are shown in a subordinate role. Some opponents believe pornographic films tend to show women as being extremely passive, or that the acts which are performed on the women are typically abusive and solely for the pleasure of their sex partner. On-face ejaculation and anal sex are increasingly popular among men, following trends in porn. MacKinnon and Dworkin defined pornography as &quot;the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women through pictures or words that also includes women dehumanized as sexual objects, things, or commodities...&quot;

Radical feminists say that consumption of pornography is a cause of rape and other forms of violence against women. Robin Morgan summarizes this idea with her oft-quoted statement, &quot;Pornography is the theory, and rape is the practice.&quot; They charge that pornography eroticizes the domination, humiliation, and coercion of women, and reinforces sexual and cultural attitudes that are complicit in rape and sexual harassment. In her book &quot;Only Words&quot; (1993), MacKinnon argues that pornography &quot;deprives women of the right to express verbal refusal of an intercourse&quot;.

MacKinnon argued that pornography leads to an increase in sexual violence against women through fostering rape myths. Such rape myths include the belief that women really want to be raped and that they mean yes when they say no. She held that &quot;rape myths perpetuate sexual violence indirectly by creating distorted beliefs and attitudes about sexual assault and shift elements of blame onto the victims&quot;. Additionally, according to MacKinnon, pornography desensitizes viewers to violence against women, and this leads to a progressive need to see more violence in order to become sexually aroused, an effect she claims is well documented.

German radical feminist Alice Schwarzer is one proponent of the view that pornography offers a distorted sense of men and women&#x27;s bodies, as well as the actual sexual act, often showing performers with synthetic implants or exaggerated expressions of pleasure, engaging in fetishes that are presented as popular and normal.

==Radical lesbian feminism==

Radical lesbians are distinguished from other radical feminists through their ideological roots in political lesbianism. Radical lesbians see lesbianism as an act of resistance against the political institution of heterosexuality, which they view as violent and oppressive towards women. Julie Bindel has written that her lesbianism is &quot;intrinsically bound up&quot; with her feminism.

During the Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement of the 1970s, straight women within the movement were challenged on the grounds that their heterosexual identities helped to perpetuate the very patriarchal systems that they were working to undo. According to radical lesbian writer Jill Johnston, a large fraction of the movement sought to reform sexist institutions while &quot;leaving intact the staple nuclear unit of oppression: heterosexual sex&quot;. Others saw lesbianism as a strong political tool to help end male dominance and as central to the women&#x27;s movement.

Radical lesbians criticized the women&#x27;s liberation movement for its failure to criticize the &quot;psychological oppression&quot; of heteronormativity, which they believed to be &quot;the sexual foundation of the social institutions&quot;. They argued that heterosexual love relationships perpetuated patriarchal power relations through &quot;personal domination&quot; and therefore directly contradicted the values and goals of the movement. As one radical lesbian wrote, &quot;no matter what the feminist does, the physical act [of heterosexuality] throws both women and man back into role playing... all of her politics are instantly shattered&quot;. They argued that the women&#x27;s liberation movement would not be successful without challenging heteronormativity.

Radical lesbians believed lesbianism actively threatened patriarchal systems of power. They defined lesbians not only by their sexual orientation, but by their liberation and independence from men. Lesbian activists Sidney Abbott and Barbara Love argued that &quot;the lesbian &quot;has&quot; freed herself from male domination&quot; through disconnecting from them not only sexually, but also &quot;financially and emotionally&quot;. They argued that lesbianism fosters the utmost independence from gendered systems of power, and from the &quot;psychological oppression&quot; of heteronormativity.

Rejecting norms of gender, sex and sexuality was central to radical lesbian feminism. Radical lesbians believed that &quot;lesbian identity was a &#x27;woman-identified&#x27; identity&#x27;&quot;, meaning it should be defined by and with reference to women, rather than in relation to men.

In their manifesto &quot;The Woman-Identified Woman&quot;, the lesbian radical feminist group Radicalesbians underlined their belief in the necessity of creating a &quot;new consciousness&quot; that rejected traditional normative definitions of womanhood and femininity which centered on powerlessness. Their redefinition of womanhood and femininity stressed the freeing of lesbian identity from harmful and divisive stereotypes. As Abbot and Love argued in &quot;Is Women&#x27;s Liberation a Lesbian Plot?&quot; (1971):

As long as the word &#x27;dyke&#x27; can be used to frighten women into a less militant stand, keep women separate from their sisters, and keep them from giving primacy to anything other than men and family—then to that extent they are dominated by male culture.

Radicalesbians reiterated this thought, writing, &quot;in this sexist society, for a woman to be independent means she can&#x27;t be a woman, she must be a dyke&quot;. The rhetoric of a &quot;woman-identified-woman&quot; has been criticized for its exclusion of heterosexual women. According to some critics, &quot;[lesbian feminism&#x27;s use of] woman-identifying rhetoric should be considered a rhetorical failure. Critics also argue that the intensity of radical lesbian feminist politics, on top of the preexisting stigma around lesbianism, gave a bad face to the feminist movement and provided fertile ground for tropes like the &quot;man-hater&quot; or &quot;bra burner&quot;.

==Views on transgender topics==
Since the 1970s, there has been a debate among radical feminists about transgender identities. Some radical feminists, such as Catharine MacKinnon, John Stoltenberg, Andrea Dworkin, Monique Wittig, and Finn Mackay have supported recognition of trans women as women, which they describe as &quot;trans-inclusive&quot; feminism, while others like Mary Daly, Janice Raymond, Robin Morgan, Germaine Greer, Sheila Jeffreys, Julie Bindel, and Robert Jensen, have argued that the transgender movement perpetuates patriarchal gender norms and is incompatible with radical feminist ideology.

Those who exclude trans women from womanhood or women&#x27;s spaces commonly refer to themselves as &quot;gender critical&quot; and are referred to by others as trans-exclusionary. Radical feminists who hold gender-critical views are often referred to as &quot;trans-exclusionary radical feminists&quot; or &quot;TERFs&quot;, an acronym to which they object, say is inaccurate (citing, for example, their inclusion of trans men as women), and argue is a slur or even hate speech.

Gender-critical or trans-exclusionary radical feminists in particular say that the difference in behavior between men and women is the result of socialization, and the idea that someone would have an inborn sense of femininity or masculinity runs contrary to the theory of gender socialization. Lierre Keith describes femininity as &quot;a set of behaviors that are, in essence, ritualized submission&quot;, and hence, gender is not an identity but a caste position, and the philosophies of gender identity (specifically the feminine essence philosophy) are an obstacle to the abolition of gender and a reversion to a sex-based society. Julie Bindel argued in 2008 that Iran carries out the highest number of sex-change operations in the world, because &quot;surgery is an attempt to keep gender stereotypes intact&quot;, and that &quot;it is precisely this idea that certain distinct behaviours are appropriate for males and females that underlies feminist criticism of the phenomenon of &#x27;transgenderism&#x27;.&quot; According to the BBC in 2014, there are no reliable figures regarding gender reassignment operations in Iran.

In 1978, the Lesbian Organization of Toronto voted to become womyn-born womyn only and wrote:

A woman&#x27;s voice was almost never heard as a woman&#x27;s voice—it was always filtered through men&#x27;s voices. So here a guy comes along saying, &quot;I&#x27;m going to be a girl now and speak for girls.&quot; And we thought, &quot;No you&#x27;re not.&quot; A person cannot just join the oppressed by fiat.

In &quot;The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male&quot; (1979), the lesbian radical feminist Janice Raymond argued that &quot;All transsexuals rape women&#x27;s bodies by reducing
the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves. However, the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist violates women&#x27;s sexuality and spirit, as well. Rape, although it is usually done by force, can also be accomplished by deception. It is significant that in the case of the transsexually constructed lesbian-feminist, often he is able to gain entrance and a dominant position in women&#x27;s spaces because the women involved do not know he is a transsexual and he just does not happen to mention it.&quot; In &quot;The Whole Woman&quot; (1999), Germaine Greer wrote that largely male governments &quot;recognise as women men who believe that they are women ... because [those governments] see women not as another sex but as a non-sex&quot;; she continued that if uterus-and-ovaries transplants were a mandatory part of sex-change operations, the latter &quot;would disappear overnight&quot;.

Sheila Jeffreys argued in 1997 that &quot;the vast majority of transsexuals still subscribe to the traditional stereotype of women&quot; and that by transitioning they are &quot;constructing a conservative fantasy of what women should be ... an essence of womanhood which is deeply insulting and restrictive.&quot; In &quot;Gender Hurts&quot; (2014), she referred to sex reassignment surgery as &quot;self-mutilation&quot;, and used pronouns that refer to sex assigned at birth. Jeffreys argued that feminists need to know &quot;the biological sex of those who claim to be women and promote prejudicial versions of what constitutes womanhood&quot;, and that the &quot;use by men of feminine pronouns conceals the masculine privilege bestowed upon them by virtue of having been placed in and brought up in the male sex caste&quot;.

By contrast, trans-inclusive radical feminists claim that a biology-based or sex-essentialist ideology itself upholds patriarchal constructions of womanhood. Others assert that trans women also contributed to the feminist movement, and Susan Stryker stated that &quot;transsexual women were active in the radical feminist movement of the late 1960s, but were almost entirely erased from its history after 1973&quot; due to pushback from gender-critical feminists. Andrea Dworkin argued as early as 1974 that transgender people and gender identity research have the potential to radically undermine patriarchal sex essentialism:

...work with transsexuals, and studies of formation of gender identity in children provide basic information which challenges the notion that there are two discrete biological sexes. That information threatens to transform the traditional biology of sex difference into the radical biology of sex similarity. That is not to say that there is one sex, but that there are many. The evidence which is germane here is simple. The words &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female&quot;, &quot;man&quot; and &quot;woman&quot;, are used only because as yet there are no others.

In the late 2010s, interest in the issue of trans-inclusive feminism rose as trans acceptance gained headway. In 2015, radical feminist Catherine MacKinnon said:

Male dominant society has defined women as a discrete biological group forever. If this was going to produce liberation, we&#x27;d be free ... To me, women is a political group. I never had much occasion to say that, or work with it, until the last few years when there has been a lot of discussion about whether trans women are women ... I always thought I don&#x27;t care how someone becomes a woman or a man; it does not matter to me. It is just part of their specificity, their uniqueness, like everyone else&#x27;s. Anybody who identifies as a woman, wants to be a woman, is going around being a woman, as far as I&#x27;m concerned, is a woman.

== Reception ==

Gail Dines, an English radical feminist, spoke in 2011 about the appeal of radical feminism to young women: &quot;After teaching women for 20-odd years, if I go in and I teach liberal feminism, I get looked [at] blank ... I go in and teach radical feminism, bang, the room explodes.&quot;

=== Criticism ===

Early in the radical feminism movement, some radical feminists theorized that &quot;other kinds of hierarchy grew out of and were modeled on male supremacy and so, were in effect, specialized forms of male supremacy&quot;. Therefore, the fight against male domination took priority because &quot;the liberation of women would mean the liberation of all&quot;. This view is contested, particularly by intersectional feminism and black feminism. Critics argue that this ideology accepts the notion that identities are singular and disparate, rather than multiple and intersecting. For example, understanding women&#x27;s oppression as disparate assumes that &quot;men, in creating and maintaining these systems, are acting purely as men, in accordance with peculiarly male characteristics or specifically male supremacist objectives&quot;.

Ellen Willis&#x27; 1984 essay &quot;Radical Feminism and Feminist Radicalism&quot; says that within the New Left, radical feminists were accused of being &quot;bourgeois&quot;, &quot;antileft&quot;, or even &quot;apolitical&quot;, whereas they saw themselves as &quot;radicalizing the left by expanding the definition of radical&quot;. Early radical feminists were mostly white and middle-class, resulting in &quot;a very fragile kind of solidarity&quot;. This limited the validity of generalizations based on radical feminists&#x27; experiences of gender relations, and prevented white and middle-class women from recognizing that they benefited from race and class privilege according to Willis. Many early radical feminists broke ties with &quot;male-dominated left groups&quot;, or would work with them only in &quot;ad hoc&quot; coalitions. Willis, although very much a part of early radical feminism and continuing to hold that it played a necessary role in placing feminism on the political agenda, criticized it as unable &quot;to integrate a feminist perspective with an overall radical politics&quot;, while viewing this limitation as inevitable in the context of the time.

<text>In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a technique for modeling light transport for use in a wide variety of rendering algorithms for generating digital images.

On a spectrum of computational cost and visual fidelity, ray tracing-based rendering techniques, such as ray casting, recursive ray tracing, distribution ray tracing, photon mapping and path tracing, are generally slower and higher fidelity than scanline rendering methods. Thus, ray tracing was first deployed in applications where taking a relatively long time to render could be tolerated, such as still CGI images, and film and television visual effects (VFX), but was less suited to real-time applications such as video games, where speed is critical in rendering each frame.

Since 2019, however, hardware acceleration for real-time ray tracing has become standard on new commercial graphics cards, and graphics APIs have followed suit, allowing developers to use hybrid ray tracing and rasterization-based rendering in games and other real-time applications with a lesser hit to frame render times.

Ray tracing is capable of simulating a variety of optical effects, such as reflection, refraction, soft shadows, scattering, depth of field, motion blur, caustics, ambient occlusion and dispersion phenomena (such as chromatic aberration). It can also be used to trace the path of sound waves in a similar fashion to light waves, making it a viable option for more immersive sound design in video games by rendering realistic reverberation and echoes. In fact, any physical wave or particle phenomenon with approximately linear motion can be simulated with ray tracing.

Ray tracing-based rendering techniques that involve sampling light over a domain generate image noise artifacts that can be addressed by tracing a very large number of rays or using denoising techniques.

==History==

The idea of ray tracing comes from as early as the 16th century when it was described by Albrecht Dürer, who is credited for its invention. 
Dürer described multiple techniques for projecting 3-D scenes onto an image plane. Some of these project chosen geometry onto the image plane, as is done with rasterization today. Others determine what geometry is visible along a given ray, as is done with ray tracing. 

Using a computer for ray tracing to generate shaded pictures was first accomplished by Arthur Appel in 1968. Appel used ray tracing for primary visibility (determining the closest surface to the camera at each image point) by tracing a ray through each point to be shaded into the scene to identify the visible surface. The closest surface intersected by the ray was the visible one. This non-recursive ray tracing-based rendering algorithm is today called &quot;ray casting&quot;. His algorithm then traced secondary rays to the light source from each point being shaded to determine whether the point was in shadow or not.

Later, in 1971, Goldstein and Nagel of MAGI (Mathematical Applications Group, Inc.) published &quot;3-D Visual Simulation&quot;, wherein ray tracing was used to make shaded pictures of solids. At the ray-surface intersection point found, they computed the surface normal and, knowing the position of the light source, computed the brightness of the pixel on the screen. Their publication describes a short (30 second) film “made using the University of Maryland’s display hardware outfitted with a 16mm camera. The film showed the helicopter and a simple ground level gun emplacement. The helicopter was programmed to undergo a series of maneuvers including turns, take-offs, and landings, etc., until it eventually is shot down and crashed.” A &quot;CDC 6600&quot; computer was used. MAGI produced an animation video called &quot;MAGI/SynthaVision Sampler&quot; in 1974.

Another early instance of ray casting came in 1976, when Scott Roth created a flip book animation in Bob Sproull&#x27;s computer graphics course at Caltech. The scanned pages are shown as a video in the accompanying image. Roth&#x27;s computer program noted an edge point at a pixel location if the ray intersected a bounded plane different from that of its neighbors. Of course, a ray could intersect multiple planes in space, but only the surface point closest to the camera was noted as visible. The platform was a DEC PDP-10, a Tektronix storage-tube display, and a printer which would create an image of the display on rolling thermal paper. Roth extended the framework, introduced the term &quot;ray casting&quot; in the context of computer graphics and solid modeling, and in 1982 published his work while at GM Research Labs.

Turner Whitted was the first to show recursive ray tracing for mirror reflection and for refraction through translucent objects, with an angle determined by the solid&#x27;s index of refraction, and to use ray tracing for anti-aliasing. Whitted also showed ray traced shadows. He produced a recursive ray-traced film called &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot; in 1979 while an engineer at Bell Labs. Whitted&#x27;s deeply recursive ray tracing algorithm reframed rendering from being primarily a matter of surface visibility determination to being a matter of light transport. His paper inspired a series of subsequent work by others that included distribution ray tracing and finally unbiased path tracing, which provides the &quot;rendering equation&quot; framework that has allowed computer generated imagery to be faithful to reality.

For decades, global illumination in major films using computer-generated imagery was approximated with additional lights. Ray tracing-based rendering eventually changed that by enabling physically-based light transport. Early feature films rendered entirely using path tracing include &quot;Monster House&quot; (2006), &quot;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&quot; (2009), and &quot;Monsters University&quot; (2013).

==Algorithm overview==
Optical ray tracing describes a method for producing visual images constructed in 3-D computer graphics environments, with more photorealism than either ray casting or scanline rendering techniques. It works by tracing a path from an imaginary eye through each pixel in a virtual screen, and calculating the color of the object visible through it.

Scenes in ray tracing are described mathematically by a programmer or by a visual artist (normally using intermediary tools). Scenes may also incorporate data from images and models captured by means such as digital photography.

Typically, each ray must be tested for intersection with some subset of all the objects in the scene. Once the nearest object has been identified, the algorithm will estimate the incoming light at the point of intersection, examine the material properties of the object, and combine this information to calculate the final color of the pixel. Certain illumination algorithms and reflective or translucent materials may require more rays to be re-cast into the scene.

It may at first seem counterintuitive or &quot;backward&quot; to send rays &quot;away&quot; from the camera, rather than &quot;into&quot; it (as actual light does in reality), but doing so is many orders of magnitude more efficient. Since the overwhelming majority of light rays from a given light source do not make it directly into the viewer&#x27;s eye, a &quot;forward&quot; simulation could potentially waste a tremendous amount of computation on light paths that are never recorded.

Therefore, the shortcut taken in ray tracing is to presuppose that a given ray intersects the view frame. After either a maximum number of reflections or a ray traveling a certain distance without intersection, the ray ceases to travel and the pixel&#x27;s value is updated.
=== Calculate rays for rectangular viewport ===
On input we have (in calculation we use vector normalization and cross product):

* formula_1 eye position
* formula_2 target position
* formula_3 field of view - for humans, we can assume formula_4
* formula_5 numbers of square pixels on viewport vertical and horizontal direction 
* formula_6 numbers of actual pixel 
* formula_7 vertical vector which indicates where is up and down, usually formula_8 - roll component which determine viewport rotation around point C (where the axis of rotation is the ET section)

The idea is to find the position of each viewport pixel center formula_9 which allows us to find the line going from eye formula_10 through that pixel and finally get the ray described by point formula_10 and vector formula_12 (or its normalisation formula_13). First we need to find the coordinates of the bottom left viewport pixel formula_14 and find the next pixel by making a shift along directions parallel to viewport (vectors formula_15 , formula_16) multiplied by the size of the pixel. Below we introduce formulas which include distance formula_17 between the eye and the viewport. However, this value will be reduced during ray normalization formula_13 (so you might as well accept that formula_19 and remove it from calculations).

Pre-calculations: let&#x27;s find and normalise vector formula_20 and vectors formula_21 which are parallel to the viewport (all depicted on above picture)

:formula_22

:formula_23

note that viewport center formula_24, next we calculate viewport sizes formula_25 divided by 2 including inverse aspect ratio formula_26

:formula_27

and then we calculate next-pixel shifting vectors formula_28 along directions parallel to viewport (formula_29), and left bottom pixel center formula_30

:formula_31

Calculations: note formula_32 and ray formula_33 so

==Detailed description of ray tracing computer algorithm and its genesis==

===What happens in nature (simplified)===

In nature, a light source emits a ray of light which travels, eventually, to a surface that interrupts its progress. One can think of this &quot;ray&quot; as a stream of photons traveling along the same path. In a perfect vacuum this ray will be a straight line (ignoring relativistic effects). Any combination of four things might happen with this light ray: absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence. A surface may absorb part of the light ray, resulting in a loss of intensity of the reflected and/or refracted light. It might also reflect all or part of the light ray, in one or more directions. If the surface has any transparent or translucent properties, it refracts a portion of the light beam into itself in a different direction while absorbing some (or all) of the spectrum (and possibly altering the color). Less commonly, a surface may absorb some portion of the light and fluorescently re-emit the light at a longer wavelength color in a random direction, though this is rare enough that it can be discounted from most rendering applications. Between absorption, reflection, refraction and fluorescence, all of the incoming light must be accounted for, and no more. A surface cannot, for instance, reflect 66% of an incoming light ray, and refract 50%, since the two would add up to be 116%. From here, the reflected and/or refracted rays may strike other surfaces, where their absorptive, refractive, reflective and fluorescent properties again affect the progress of the incoming rays. Some of these rays travel in such a way that they hit our eye, causing us to see the scene and so contribute to the final rendered image.

===Ray casting algorithm===

The idea behind ray casting, the predecessor to recursive ray tracing, is to trace rays from the eye, one per pixel, and find the closest object blocking the path of that ray. Think of an image as a screen-door, with each square in the screen being a pixel. This is then the object the eye sees through that pixel. Using the material properties and the effect of the lights in the scene, this algorithm can determine the shading of this object. The simplifying assumption is made that if a surface faces a light, the light will reach that surface and not be blocked or in shadow. The shading of the surface is computed using traditional 3-D computer graphics shading models. One important advantage ray casting offered over older scanline algorithms was its ability to easily deal with non-planar surfaces and solids, such as cones and spheres. If a mathematical surface can be intersected by a ray, it can be rendered using ray casting. Elaborate objects can be created by using solid modeling techniques and easily rendered.

===Volume ray casting algorithm===
In the method of volume ray casting, each ray is traced so that color and/or density can be sampled along the ray and then be combined into a final pixel color.
This is often used when objects cannot be easily represented by explicit surfaces (such as triangles), for example when rendering clouds or 3D medical scans. 
===SDF ray marching algorithm===

In SDF ray marching, or sphere tracing, each ray is traced in multiple steps to approximate an intersection point between the ray and a surface defined by a signed distance function (SDF). The SDF is evaluated for each iteration in order to be able take as large steps as possible without missing any part of the surface. A threshold is used to cancel further iteration when a point is reached that is close enough to the surface. This method is often used for 3-D fractal rendering.

===Recursive ray tracing algorithm===

Earlier algorithms traced rays from the eye into the scene until they hit an object, but determined the ray color without recursively tracing more rays. Recursive ray tracing continues the process. When a ray hits a surface, additional rays may be cast because of reflection, refraction, and shadow.:
* A reflection ray is traced in the mirror-reflection direction. The closest object it intersects is what will be seen in the reflection.
*A refraction ray traveling through transparent material works similarly, with the addition that a refractive ray could be entering or exiting a material. Turner Whitted extended the mathematical logic for rays passing through a transparent solid to include the effects of refraction.
* A shadow ray is traced toward each light. If any opaque object is found between the surface and the light, the surface is in shadow and the light does not illuminate it.
These recursive rays add more realism to ray traced images.

===Advantages over other rendering methods===
Ray tracing-based rendering&#x27;s popularity stems from its basis in a realistic simulation of light transport, as compared to other rendering methods, such as rasterization, which focuses more on the realistic simulation of geometry. Effects such as reflections and shadows, which are difficult to simulate using other algorithms, are a natural result of the ray tracing algorithm. The computational independence of each ray makes ray tracing amenable to a basic level of parallelization, but the divergence of ray paths makes high utilization under parallelism quite difficult to achieve in practice.

=== Disadvantages ===
A serious disadvantage of ray tracing is performance (though it can in theory be faster than traditional scanline rendering depending on scene complexity vs. number of pixels on-screen). Until the late 2010s, ray tracing in real time was usually considered impossible on consumer hardware for nontrivial tasks. Scanline algorithms and other algorithms use data coherence to share computations between pixels, while ray tracing normally starts the process anew, treating each eye ray separately. However, this separation offers other advantages, such as the ability to shoot more rays as needed to perform spatial anti-aliasing and improve image quality where needed.

Whitted-style recursive ray tracing handles interreflection and optical effects such as refraction, but is not generally photorealistic. Improved realism occurs when the rendering equation is fully evaluated, as the equation conceptually includes every physical effect of light flow. However, this is infeasible given the computing resources required, and the limitations on geometric and material modeling fidelity. Path tracing is an algorithm for evaluating the rendering equation and thus gives a higher fidelity simulations of real-world lighting.

===Reversed direction of traversal of scene by the rays===
The process of shooting rays from the eye to the light source to render an image is sometimes called &quot;backwards ray tracing&quot;, since it is the opposite direction photons actually travel. However, there is confusion with this terminology. Early ray tracing was always done from the eye, and early researchers such as James Arvo used the term &quot;backwards ray tracing&quot; to mean shooting rays from the lights and gathering the results. Therefore, it is clearer to distinguish &quot;eye-based&quot; versus &quot;light-based&quot; ray tracing.

While the direct illumination is generally best sampled using eye-based ray tracing, certain indirect effects can benefit from rays generated from the lights. Caustics are bright patterns caused by the focusing of light off a wide reflective region onto a narrow area of (near-)diffuse surface. An algorithm that casts rays directly from lights onto reflective objects, tracing their paths to the eye, will better sample this phenomenon. This integration of eye-based and light-based rays is often expressed as bidirectional path tracing, in which paths are traced from both the eye and lights, and the paths subsequently joined by a connecting ray after some length.

Photon mapping is another method that uses both light-based and eye-based ray tracing; in an initial pass, energetic photons are traced along rays from the light source so as to compute an estimate of radiant flux as a function of 3-dimensional space (the eponymous photon map itself). In a subsequent pass, rays are traced from the eye into the scene to determine the visible surfaces, and the photon map is used to estimate the illumination at the visible surface points. The advantage of photon mapping versus bidirectional path tracing is the ability to achieve significant reuse of photons, reducing computation, at the cost of statistical bias.

An additional problem occurs when light must pass through a very narrow aperture to illuminate the scene (consider a darkened room, with a door slightly ajar leading to a brightly lit room), or a scene in which most points do not have direct line-of-sight to any light source (such as with ceiling-directed light fixtures or torchieres). In such cases, only a very small subset of paths will transport energy; Metropolis light transport is a method which begins with a random search of the path space, and when energetic paths are found, reuses this information by exploring the nearby space of rays.
To the right is an image showing a simple example of a path of rays recursively generated from the camera (or eye) to the light source using the above algorithm. A diffuse surface reflects light in all directions.

First, a ray is created at an eyepoint and traced through a pixel and into the scene, where it hits a diffuse surface. From that surface the algorithm recursively generates a reflection ray, which is traced through the scene, where it hits another diffuse surface. Finally, another reflection ray is generated and traced through the scene, where it hits the light source and is absorbed. The color of the pixel now depends on the colors of the first and second diffuse surface and the color of the light emitted from the light source. For example, if the light source emitted white light and the two diffuse surfaces were blue, then the resulting color of the pixel is blue.

===Example===
As a demonstration of the principles involved in ray tracing, consider how one would find the intersection between a ray and a sphere. This is merely the math behind the line–sphere intersection and the subsequent determination of the colour of the pixel being calculated. There is, of course, far more to the general process of ray tracing, but this demonstrates an example of the algorithms used.

In vector notation, the equation of a sphere with center formula_36 and radius formula_37 is

:formula_38

Any point on a ray starting from point formula_39 with direction formula_40 (here formula_40 is a unit vector) can be written as

:formula_42

where formula_43 is its distance between formula_44 and formula_39. In our problem, we know formula_36, formula_37, formula_39 (e.g. the position of a light source) and formula_40, and we need to find formula_43. Therefore, we substitute for formula_44:

:formula_52

Let formula_53 for simplicity; then

:formula_54

:formula_55

:formula_56

Knowing that d is a unit vector allows us this minor simplification:

:formula_57

This quadratic equation has solutions
:formula_58

The two values of formula_59 found by solving this equation are the two ones such that formula_60 are the points where the ray intersects the sphere.

Any value which is negative does not lie on the ray, but rather in the opposite half-line (i.e. the one starting from formula_39 with opposite direction).

If the quantity under the square root (the discriminant) is negative, then the ray does not intersect the sphere.

Let us suppose now that there is at least a positive solution, and let formula_59 be the minimal one. In addition, let us suppose that the sphere is the nearest object on our scene intersecting our ray, and that it is made of a reflective material. We need to find in which direction the light ray is reflected. The laws of reflection state that the angle of reflection is equal and opposite to the angle of incidence between the incident ray and the normal to the sphere.

The normal to the sphere is simply

:formula_63

where formula_64 is the intersection point found before. The reflection direction can be found by a reflection of formula_40 with respect to formula_66, that is

: formula_67

Thus the reflected ray has equation

: formula_68

Now we only need to compute the intersection of the latter ray with our field of view, to get the pixel which our reflected light ray will hit. Lastly, this pixel is set to an appropriate color, taking into account how the color of the original light source and the one of the sphere are combined by the reflection.

==Adaptive depth control==
Adaptive depth control means that the renderer stops generating reflected/transmitted rays when the computed intensity becomes less than a certain threshold. There must always be a set maximum depth or else the program would generate an infinite number of rays. But it is not always necessary to go to the maximum depth if the surfaces are not highly reflective. To test for this the ray tracer must compute and keep the product of the global and reflection coefficients as the rays are traced.

Example: let Kr = 0.5 for a set of surfaces. Then from the first surface the maximum contribution is 0.5, for the reflection from the second: 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.25, the third: 0.25 × 0.5 = 0.125, the fourth: 0.125 × 0.5 = 0.0625, the fifth: 0.0625 × 0.5 = 0.03125, etc. In addition we might implement a distance attenuation factor such as 1/D2, which would also decrease the intensity contribution.

For a transmitted ray we could do something similar but in that case the distance traveled through the object would cause even faster intensity decrease. As an example of this, Hall &amp; Greenberg found that even for a very reflective scene, using this with a maximum depth of 15 resulted in an average ray tree depth of 1.7.

==Bounding volumes==
Enclosing groups of objects in sets of bounding volume hierarchies (BVH) decreases the amount of computations required for ray tracing. A cast ray is first tested for an intersection with the bounding volume, and then if there is an intersection, the volume is recursively divided until the ray hits the object. The best type of bounding volume will be determined by the shape of the underlying object or objects. For example, if the objects are long and thin, then a sphere will enclose mainly empty space compared to a box. Boxes are also easier to generate hierarchical bounding volumes.

Note that using a hierarchical system like this (assuming it is done carefully) changes the intersection computational time from a linear dependence on the number of objects to something between linear and a logarithmic dependence. This is because, for a perfect case, each intersection test would divide the possibilities by two, and result in a binary tree type structure. Spatial subdivision methods, discussed below, try to achieve this. Furthermore, this acceleration structure makes the ray-tracing computation output-sensitive. I.e. the complexity of the ray intersection calculations depends on the number of objects that actually intersect the rays and not (only) on the number of objects in the scene.

Kay &amp; Kajiya give a list of desired properties for hierarchical bounding volumes:

* Subtrees should contain objects that are near each other and the further down the tree the closer should be the objects.
* The volume of each node should be minimal.
* The sum of the volumes of all bounding volumes should be minimal.
* Greater attention should be placed on the nodes near the root since pruning a branch near the root will remove more potential objects than one farther down the tree.
* The time spent constructing the hierarchy should be much less than the time saved by using it.

==Interactive ray tracing==

The first implementation of an interactive ray tracer was the LINKS-1 Computer Graphics System built in 1982 at Osaka University&#x27;s School of Engineering, by professors Ohmura Kouichi, Shirakawa Isao and Kawata Toru with 50 students. It was a massively parallel processing computer system with 514 microprocessors (257 Zilog Z8001s and 257 iAPX 86s), used for 3-D computer graphics with high-speed ray tracing. According to the Information Processing Society of Japan: &quot;The core of 3-D image rendering is calculating the luminance of each pixel making up a rendered surface from the given viewpoint, light source, and object position. The LINKS-1 system was developed to realize an image rendering methodology in which each pixel could be parallel processed independently using ray tracing. By developing a new software methodology specifically for high-speed image rendering, LINKS-1 was able to rapidly render highly realistic images.&quot; It was used to create an early 3-D planetarium-like video of the heavens made completely with computer graphics. The video was presented at the Fujitsu pavilion at the 1985 International Exposition in Tsukuba.&quot; It was the second system to do so after the Evans &amp; Sutherland Digistar in 1982. The LINKS-1 was claimed by the designers to be the world&#x27;s most powerful computer in 1984.

The next interactive ray tracer, and the first known to have been labeled &quot;real-time&quot; was credited at the 2005 SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference as being the REMRT/RT tools developed in 1986 by Mike Muuss for the BRL-CAD solid modeling system. Initially published in 1987 at USENIX, the BRL-CAD ray tracer was an early implementation of a parallel network distributed ray tracing system that achieved several frames per second in rendering performance. This performance was attained by means of the highly optimized yet platform independent LIBRT ray tracing engine in BRL-CAD and by using solid implicit CSG geometry on several shared memory parallel machines over a commodity network. BRL-CAD&#x27;s ray tracer, including the REMRT/RT tools, continue to be available and developed today as open source software.

Since then, there have been considerable efforts and research towards implementing ray tracing at real-time speeds for a variety of purposes on stand-alone desktop configurations. These purposes include interactive 3-D graphics applications such as demoscene productions, computer and video games, and image rendering. Some real-time software 3-D engines based on ray tracing have been developed by hobbyist demo programmers since the late 1990s.

In 1999 a team from the University of Utah, led by Steven Parker, demonstrated interactive ray tracing live at the 1999 Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics. They rendered a 35 million sphere model at 512 by 512 pixel resolution, running at approximately 15 frames per second on 60 CPUs.

The Open RT project included a highly optimized software core for ray tracing along with an OpenGL-like API in order to offer an alternative to the current rasterization based approach for interactive 3-D graphics. Ray tracing hardware, such as the experimental Ray Processing Unit developed by Sven Woop at the Saarland University, was designed to accelerate some of the computationally intensive operations of ray tracing.

The idea that video games could ray trace their graphics in real time received media attention in the late 2000s. During that time, a researcher named Daniel Pohl, under the guidance of graphics professor Philipp Slusallek and in cooperation with the Erlangen University and Saarland University in Germany, equipped &quot;Quake III&quot; and &quot;Quake IV&quot; with an engine he programmed himself, which Saarland University then demonstrated at CeBIT 2007. Intel, a patron of Saarland, became impressed enough that it hired Pohl and embarked on a research program dedicated to ray traced graphics, which it saw as justifying increasing the number of its processors&#x27; cores. On June 12, 2008, Intel demonstrated a special version of &quot;Enemy Territory: Quake Wars&quot;, titled &quot;Quake Wars: Ray Traced&quot;, using ray tracing for rendering, running in basic HD (720p) resolution. &quot;ETQW&quot; operated at 14–29 frames per second on a 16-core (4 socket, 4 core) Xeon Tigerton system running at 2.93 GHz.

At SIGGRAPH 2009, Nvidia announced OptiX, a free API for real-time ray tracing on Nvidia GPUs. The API exposes seven programmable entry points within the ray tracing pipeline, allowing for custom cameras, ray-primitive intersections, shaders, shadowing, etc. This flexibility enables bidirectional path tracing, Metropolis light transport, and many other rendering algorithms that cannot be implemented with tail recursion. OptiX-based renderers are used in Autodesk Arnold, Adobe AfterEffects, Bunkspeed Shot, Autodesk Maya, 3ds max, and many other renderers.

In 2014, a demo of the PlayStation 4 video game &quot;The Tomorrow Children&quot;, developed by Q-Games and Japan Studio, demonstrated new lighting techniques developed by Q-Games, notably cascaded voxel cone ray tracing, which simulates lighting in real-time and uses more realistic reflections rather than screen space reflections.

Nvidia introduced their GeForce RTX and Quadro RTX GPUs September 2018, based on the Turing architecture that allows for hardware-accelerated ray tracing. The Nvidia hardware uses a separate functional block, publicly called an &quot;RT core&quot;. This unit is somewhat comparable to a texture unit in size, latency, and interface to the processor core. The unit features BVH traversal, compressed BVH node decompression, ray-AABB intersection testing, and ray-triangle intersection testing. The GeForce RTX, in the form of models 2080 and 2080 Ti, became the first consumer-oriented brand of graphics card that can perform ray tracing in real time, and, in November 2018, Electronic Arts&#x27; &quot;Battlefield V&quot; became the first game to take advantage of its ray tracing capabilities, which it achieves via Microsoft&#x27;s new API, DirectX Raytracing. AMD, which already offered interactive ray tracing on top of OpenCL through its Radeon ProRender, unveiled in October 2020 the Radeon RX 6000 series, its second generation Navi GPUs with support for hardware-accelerated ray tracing at an online event. Subsequent games that render their graphics by such means appeared since, which has been credited to the improvements in hardware and efforts to make more APIs and game engines compatible with the technology. Current home gaming consoles implement dedicated ray tracing hardware components in their GPUs for real-time ray tracing effects, which began with the ninth-generation consoles PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Series S.

On 4 November, 2021, Imagination Technologies announced their IMG CXT GPU with hardware-accelerated ray tracing. On January 18, 2022, Samsung announced their Exynos 2200 AP SoC with hardware-accelerated ray tracing. On June 28, 2022, Arm announced their Immortalis-G715 with hardware-accelerated ray tracing. On November 16, 2022, Qualcomm announced their Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 with hardware-accelerated ray tracing. 

On September 12, 2023 Apple introduced hardware-accelerated ray tracing in its chip designs, beginning with the A17 Pro chip for iPhone 15 Pro models. Later the same year, Apple released M3 family of processors with HW enabled ray tracing support. Currently, this technology is accessible across iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers via the Metal API. Apple reports up to a 4x performance increase over previous software-based ray tracing on the phone and up to 2.5x faster comparing M3 to M1 chips. The hardware implementation includes acceleration structure traversal and dedicated ray-box intersections, and the API supports RayQuery (Inline Ray Tracing) as well as RayPipeline features.
== Computational complexity ==
Various complexity results have been proven for certain formulations of the ray tracing problem. In particular, if the decision version of the ray tracing problem is defined as follows – given a light ray&#x27;s initial position and direction and some fixed point, does the ray eventually reach that point, then the referenced paper proves the following results:
* Ray tracing in 3-D optical systems with a finite set of reflective or refractive objects represented by a system of rational quadratic inequalities is undecidable.
* Ray tracing in 3-D optical systems with a finite set of refractive objects represented by a system of rational linear inequalities is undecidable.
* Ray tracing in 3-D optical systems with a finite set of rectangular reflective or refractive objects is undecidable.
* Ray tracing in 3-D optical systems with a finite set of reflective or partially reflective objects represented by a system of linear inequalities, some of which can be irrational is undecidable.
* Ray tracing in 3-D optical systems with a finite set of reflective or partially reflective objects represented by a system of rational linear inequalities is PSPACE-hard.
* For any dimension equal to or greater than 2, ray tracing with a finite set of parallel and perpendicular reflective surfaces represented by rational linear inequalities is in PSPACE.

<doc id="26002" wikidata="Q434593" url="?curid=26002" title="Ron Carter">
<text>Ronald Levin Carter (born May 4, 1937) is an American jazz double bassist. His appearances on 2,221 recording sessions make him the most-recorded jazz bassist in history. He has won three Grammy Awards, and is also a cellist who has recorded numerous times on the instrument. In addition to a solo career of more than 60 years, Carter is well-known for playing on numerous iconic Blue Note albums in the 1960s, as well as being the anchor of trumpeter Miles Davis&#x27;s &quot;Second Great Quintet&quot; from 1963-1968.

Beginning with &quot;Where?&quot; in 1961, Carter&#x27;s studio albums as leader also include &quot;Uptown Conversation&quot; (1969), &quot;Blues Farm&quot; (1973), &quot;All Blues&quot; (1973), &quot;Spanish Blue&quot; (1974), &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (1975), &quot;Yellow &amp; Green&quot; (1976), &quot;Pastels&quot; (1976), &quot;Piccolo&quot; (1977), &quot;Third Plane&quot; (1977), &quot;Peg Leg&quot; (1978), &quot;A Song for You&quot; (1978), &quot;Etudes&quot; (1982), &quot;The Golden Striker&quot; (2003), &quot;Dear Miles&quot; (2006), and &quot;Ron Carter&#x27;s Great Big Band&quot; (2011).

==Early life==
Carter was born in Ferndale, Michigan. His father was a bus driver for the city of Detroit.

At the age of 10, he started playing the cello, switching to bass while at Cass Technical High School. He earned a B.A. in music from the Eastman School of Music (1959) and a master&#x27;s degree in music from the Manhattan School of Music (1961). While at Eastman, Carter began the shift from classical to jazz when he, Pee Wee Ellis and other friends put together a house band to play at the Pythodd Room, a club on Clarissa Street in segregated Rochester, where he met players on the Chitlin Circuit who encouraged him to go to New York City. 

Carter&#x27;s first jobs as a jazz musician were playing bass with Chico Hamilton in 1959, followed by freelance work with Jaki Byard, Cannonball Adderley, Randy Weston, Bobby Timmons, and Thelonious Monk. One of his first recorded appearances was on Hamilton alumnus Eric Dolphy&#x27;s &quot;Out There&quot;, recorded on August 15, 1960, and featuring George Duvivier on bass, Roy Haynes on drums, and Carter on cello. The album&#x27;s advanced harmonies and concepts were in step with the third stream movement. In early October 1960, Carter recorded &quot;How Time Passes&quot; with Don Ellis, and on June 20, 1961, he recorded &quot;Where?&quot;, his first album as a leader, featuring Dolphy on alto sax, flute, and bass clarinet; Mal Waldron on piano; Charlie Persip on drums; and Duvivier playing basslines on tracks where Carter played cello.

==Career==
===1960s–1980s===
Carter was a member of the second Miles Davis Quintet in the mid 1960s, which also included Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter and drummer Tony Williams. Carter joined Davis&#x27;s group in 1963, appearing on the album &quot;Seven Steps to Heaven&quot;, and the follow-up &quot;E.S.P.&quot;, the latter being the first album to feature only the full quintet. It also featured three of Carter&#x27;s compositions (the only time he contributed compositions to Davis&#x27;s group). He stayed with Davis until 1968 (when he was replaced by Dave Holland), and participated in a couple of studio sessions with Davis in 1969 and 1970. Although he played electric bass occasionally during this era of early jazz-rock fusion, he has subsequently stopped playing that instrument, and in the 2000s plays only double bass.

Carter also performed on some of Hancock, Williams and Shorter&#x27;s recordings during the 1960s for Blue Note. He was a sideman on many Blue Note recordings of the era, playing with Sam Rivers, Freddie Hubbard, Duke Pearson, Lee Morgan, McCoy Tyner, Andrew Hill, Horace Silver, and others. He also played on soul-pop star Roberta Flack&#x27;s album &quot;First Take&quot; and Gil Scott Heron&#x27;s &quot;Pieces of a Man&quot;, including the iconic bass-line on &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot;.

After leaving Davis, Carter was for several years a mainstay of CTI Records, making albums under his own name and also appearing on many of the label&#x27;s records with a diverse range of other musicians. Notable musical partnerships in the 1970s and 1980s included Joe Henderson, Houston Person, Hank Jones, Gabor Szabo and Cedar Walton. During the 1970s he was a member of the New York Jazz Quartet. In 1986, Carter played double bass on &quot;Big Man on Mulberry Street&quot; on Billy Joel&#x27;s album &quot;The Bridge&quot;. In 1987, Carter won a Grammy for &quot;an instrumental composition for the film&quot; &quot;Round Midnight&quot;.

===1990s–2000s===

In 1994, he won his second Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Group for a tribute album to Miles Davis. He appeared on the alternative hip hop group A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s influential album &quot;The Low End Theory&quot; on a track called &quot;Verses from the Abstract&quot;. Carter also recorded as a member of the jazz combo the Classical Jazz Quartet. In 1994, Carter appeared on the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool&quot;. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African-American community, was heralded as &quot;Album of the Year&quot; by &quot;TIME&quot;. In 2001, Carter collaborated with Black Star and John Patton to record &quot;Money Jungle&quot; for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;Red Hot + Indigo&quot;, a tribute to Duke Ellington.

Beginning in the 1990s, Carter became a Distinguished Professor Emeritus of the music department of City College of New York, having taught there for 20 years, and received an honorary doctorate from the Berklee College of Music in spring 2005. He joined the faculty of the Juilliard School in New York City in 2008, teaching bass in the school&#x27;s Jazz Studies program. Carter made an appearance in Robert Altman&#x27;s 1996 film, &quot;Kansas City&quot;, at the center of which is a jazz club called the Hey Hey Club. The film&#x27;s end credits feature Carter and fellow bassist Christian McBride duetting on &quot;Solitude&quot; at the club, owned by a black gangster called Seldom Seen, who was played by a &quot;show-stealing&quot; Harry Belafonte. (In a 2023 tribute, Carter would reveal how it came about that Belafonte had been his landlord.)

Carter sits on the advisory committee of the board of directors of The Jazz Foundation of America and on the Honorary Founder&#x27;s Committee. Carter has worked with the Jazz Foundation since its inception to save the homes and the lives of America&#x27;s elderly jazz and blues musicians including musicians that survived Hurricane Katrina.

Carter appeared as himself in an episode of the HBO series &quot;Treme&quot; entitled &quot;What Is New Orleans&quot;. His authorized biography, &quot;Ron Carter: Finding the Right Notes&quot; (), by Dan Ouellette, was published by ArtistShare in 2008.

=== 2010s and later ===
In 2010, Carter was honored with France&#x27;s premier cultural award, the medallion and title of Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Carter was elected to the &quot;DownBeat&quot; Jazz Hall of Fame in 2012.

In August 2021, Carter was the featured guest in a 47-minute video interview with YouTuber and musician Rick Beato. In November 2021, the Japanese government honored Carter with The Order of the Rising Sun, Gold Rays with Rosette. Japanese officials credited Carter with helping to popularize jazz in Japan and facilitating cultural exchange. In April 2022 Carter sat in with Bob Weir at Radio City Music Hall. In May 2022, Carter celebrated his birthday by releasing a Tiny Desk Concert recorded at the Blue Note Jazz Club featuring Russell Malone and Donald Vega.

Carter continues to record as a sideman, most recently appearing on Daniele Cordisco&#x27;s 2023 album &quot;Bitter Head.&quot; In August 2024 he was inducted into the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame

<text>The radian, denoted by the symbol rad, is the unit of angle in the International System of Units (SI) and is the standard unit of angular measure used in many areas of mathematics. It is defined such that one radian is the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc that is equal in length to the radius. The unit was formerly an SI supplementary unit and is currently a dimensionless SI derived unit, defined in the SI as 1 rad = 1 and expressed in terms of the SI base unit metre (m) as . Angles without explicitly specified units are generally assumed to be measured in radians, especially in mathematical writing.

== Definition ==

One radian is defined as the angle at the center of a circle in a plane that an arc whose length equals the radius of the circle. More generally, the magnitude in radians of a subtended angle is equal to the ratio of the arc length to the radius of the circle; that is, formula_1, where is the magnitude in radians of the subtended angle, is arc length, and is radius. A right angle is exactly formula_2 radians.

One complete revolution, expressed as an angle in radians, is the length of the circumference divided by the radius, which is formula_3, or . Thus,  radians is equal to 360 degrees. The relation can be derived using the formula for arc length, formula_4. Since radian is the measure of an angle that is subtended by an arc of a length equal to the radius of the circle, formula_5. This can be further simplified to formula_6. Multiplying both sides by gives .

=== Unit symbol ===
The International Bureau of Weights and Measures and International Organization for Standardization specify rad as the symbol for the radian. Alternative symbols that were in use in 1909 are c (the superscript letter c, for &quot;circular measure&quot;), the letter r, or a superscript , but these variants are infrequently used, as they may be mistaken for a degree symbol (°) or a radius (r). Hence an angle of 1.2 radians would be written today as 1.2 rad; archaic notations include 1.2 r, 1.2, 1.2, or 1.2.

In mathematical writing, the symbol &quot;rad&quot; is often omitted. When quantifying an angle in the absence of any symbol, radians are assumed, and when degrees are meant, the degree sign is used.

=== Dimensional analysis ===
Plane angle may be defined as , where is the magnitude in radians of the subtended angle, is circular arc length, and is radius. One radian corresponds to the angle for which , hence = 1. However, is only to be used to express angles, not to express ratios of lengths in general. A similar calculation using the area of a circular sector gives 1 radian as 1 m2/m2 = 1. The key fact is that the radian is a dimensionless unit equal to 1. In SI 2019, the SI radian is defined accordingly as . It is a long-established practice in mathematics and across all areas of science to make use of .

Giacomo Prando writes &quot;the current state of affairs leads inevitably to ghostly appearances and disappearances of the radian in the dimensional analysis of physical equations&quot;. For example, an object hanging by a string from a pulley will rise or drop by centimetres, where is the magnitude of the radius of the pulley in centimetres and is the magnitude of the angle through which the pulley turns in radians. When multiplying by , the unit radian does not appear in the product, nor does the unit centimetre—because both factors are magnitudes (numbers). Similarly in the formula for the angular velocity of a rolling wheel, , radians appear in the units of but not on the right hand side. Anthony French calls this phenomenon &quot;a perennial problem in the teaching of mechanics&quot;. Oberhofer says that the typical advice of ignoring radians during dimensional analysis and adding or removing radians in units according to convention and contextual knowledge is &quot;pedagogically unsatisfying&quot;.

In 1993 the American Association of Physics Teachers Metric Committee specified that the radian should explicitly appear in quantities only when different numerical values would be obtained when other angle measures were used, such as in the quantities of angle measure (rad), angular speed (rad/s), angular acceleration (rad/s2), and torsional stiffness (N⋅m/rad), and not in the quantities of torque (N⋅m) and angular momentum (kg⋅m2/s).

At least a dozen scientists between 1936 and 2022 have made proposals to treat the radian as a base unit of measurement for a base quantity (and dimension) of &quot;plane angle&quot;. Quincey&#x27;s review of proposals outlines two classes of proposal. The first option changes the unit of a radius to meters per radian, but this is incompatible with dimensional analysis for the area of a circle, . The other option is to introduce a dimensional constant. According to Quincey this approach is &quot;logically rigorous&quot; compared to SI, but requires &quot;the modification of many familiar mathematical and physical equations&quot;. A dimensional constant for angle is &quot;rather strange&quot; and the difficulty of modifying equations to add the dimensional constant is likely to preclude widespread use.

In particular, Quincey identifies Torrens&#x27; proposal to introduce a constant equal to 1 inverse radian (1 rad−1) in a fashion similar to the introduction of the constant &quot;ε&quot;0. With this change the formula for the angle subtended at the center of a circle, , is modified to become , and the Taylor series for the sine of an angle becomes:
formula_7
where formula_8 is the angle in radians.
The capitalized function is the &quot;complete&quot; function that takes an argument with a dimension of angle and is independent of the units expressed, while is the traditional function on pure numbers which assumes its argument is a dimensionless number in radians. The capitalised symbol formula_9 can be denoted formula_10 if it is clear that the complete form is meant.

Current SI can be considered relative to this framework as a natural unit system where the equation is assumed to hold, or similarly, . This &quot;radian convention&quot; allows the omission of in mathematical formulas.

Defining radian as a base unit may be useful for software, where the disadvantage of longer equations is minimal. For example, the Boost units library defines angle units with a codice_1 dimension, and Mathematica&#x27;s unit system similarly considers angles to have an angle dimension.

== Conversions ==
=== Between degrees ===
As stated, one radian is equal to formula_11. Thus, to convert from radians to degrees, multiply by formula_11.

:formula_13

For example:
:formula_14
:formula_15
:formula_16

Conversely, to convert from degrees to radians, multiply by formula_17.

:formula_18

For example:

:formula_19
formula_20

Radians can be converted to turns (one turn is the angle corresponding to a revolution) by dividing the number of radians by 2.

=== Between gradians ===

One revolution is formula_21 radians, which equals one turn, which is by definition 400 gradians (400 gons or 400g). To convert from radians to gradians multiply by formula_22, and to convert from gradians to radians multiply by formula_23. For example,
:formula_24
:formula_25

== Usage ==

=== Mathematics ===
In calculus and most other branches of mathematics beyond practical geometry, angles are measured in radians. This is because radians have a mathematical naturalness that leads to a more elegant formulation of some important results.

Results in analysis involving trigonometric functions can be elegantly stated when the functions&#x27; arguments are expressed in radians. For example, the use of radians leads to the simple limit formula

:formula_26

which is the basis of many other identities in mathematics, including

:formula_27
:formula_28

Because of these and other properties, the trigonometric functions appear in solutions to mathematical problems that are not obviously related to the functions&#x27; geometrical meanings (for example, the solutions to the differential equation formula_29, the evaluation of the integral formula_30 and so on). In all such cases, it is appropriate that the arguments of the functions are treated as (dimensionless) numbers—without any reference to angles.

The trigonometric functions of angles also have simple and elegant series expansions when radians are used. For example, when &quot;x&quot; is the angle expressed in radians, the Taylor series for sin &quot;x&quot; becomes:

:formula_31

If &quot;y&quot; were the angle &quot;x&quot; but expressed in degrees, i.e. , then the series would contain messy factors involving powers of /180:

:formula_32

In a similar spirit, if angles are involved, mathematically important relationships between the sine and cosine functions and the exponential function (see, for example, Euler&#x27;s formula) can be elegantly stated when the functions&#x27; arguments are angles expressed in radians (and messy otherwise). More generally, in complex-number theory, the arguments of these functions are (dimensionless, possibly complex) numbers—without any reference to physical angles at all.

=== Physics ===
The radian is widely used in physics when angular measurements are required. For example, angular velocity is typically expressed in the unit radian per second (rad/s). One revolution per second corresponds to 2 radians per second.

Similarly, the unit used for angular acceleration is often radian per second per second (rad/s2).

For the purpose of dimensional analysis, the units of angular velocity and angular acceleration are s−1 and s−2 respectively.

Likewise, the phase angle difference of two waves can also be expressed using the radian as the unit. For example, if the phase angle difference of two waves is (&quot;n&quot;⋅2) radians, where &quot;n&quot; is an integer, they are considered to be in phase, whilst if the phase angle difference of two waves is () radians, with &quot;n&quot; an integer, they are considered to be in antiphase.

A unit of reciprocal radian or inverse radian (rad−1) is involved in derived units such as meter per radian (for angular wavelength) or newton-metre per radian (for torsional stiffness).

=== Prefixes and variants ===
Metric prefixes for submultiples are used with radians. A milliradian (mrad) is a thousandth of a radian (0.001 rad), i.e. . There are 2 × 1000 milliradians (≈ 6283.185 mrad) in a circle. So a milliradian is just under of the angle subtended by a full circle. This unit of angular measurement of a circle is in common use by telescopic sight manufacturers using (stadiametric) rangefinding in reticles. The divergence of laser beams is also usually measured in milliradians.

The angular mil is an approximation of the milliradian used by NATO and other military organizations in gunnery and targeting. Each angular mil represents of a circle and is % or 1.875% smaller than the milliradian. For the small angles typically found in targeting work, the convenience of using the number 6400 in calculation outweighs the small mathematical errors it introduces. In the past, other gunnery systems have used different approximations to ; for example Sweden used the &quot;streck&quot; and the USSR used . Being based on the milliradian, the NATO mil subtends roughly 1 m at a range of 1000 m (at such small angles, the curvature is negligible).

Prefixes smaller than milli- are useful in measuring extremely small angles. Microradians (μrad, ) and nanoradians (nrad, ) are used in astronomy, and can also be used to measure the beam quality of lasers with ultra-low divergence. More common is the arc second, which is  rad (around 4.8481 microradians).

== History ==

=== Pre-20th century ===
The idea of measuring angles by the length of the arc was in use by mathematicians quite early. For example, al-Kashi (c. 1400) used so-called &quot;diameter parts&quot; as units, where one diameter part was radian. They also used sexagesimal subunits of the diameter part. Newton in 1672 spoke of &quot;the angular quantity of a body&#x27;s circular motion&quot;, but used it only as a relative measure to develop an astronomical algorithm.

The concept of &quot;the&quot; radian measure is normally credited to Roger Cotes, who died in 1716. By 1722, his cousin Robert Smith had collected and published Cotes&#x27; mathematical writings in a book, &quot;Harmonia mensurarum&quot;. In a chapter of editorial comments, Smith gave what is probably the first published calculation of one radian in degrees, citing a note of Cotes that has not survived. Smith described the radian in everything but name – &quot;Now this number is equal to 180 degrees as the radius of a circle to the semicircumference, this is as 1 to 3.141592653589&quot; –, and recognized its naturalness as a unit of angular measure.

In 1765, Leonhard Euler implicitly adopted the radian as a unit of angle. Specifically, Euler defined angular velocity as &quot;The angular speed in rotational motion is the speed of that point, the distance of which from the axis of gyration is expressed by one.&quot; Euler was probably the first to adopt this convention, referred to as the radian convention, which gives the simple formula for angular velocity . As discussed in &quot;&quot;, the radian convention has been widely adopted, while dimensionally consistent formulations require the insertion of a dimensional constant, for example .

Prior to the term &quot;radian&quot; becoming widespread, the unit was commonly called &quot;circular measure&quot; of an angle. The term &quot;radian&quot; first appeared in print on 5 June 1873, in examination questions set by James Thomson (brother of Lord Kelvin) at Queen&#x27;s College, Belfast. He had used the term as early as 1871, while in 1869, Thomas Muir, then of the University of St Andrews, vacillated between the terms &quot;rad&quot;, &quot;radial&quot;, and &quot;radian&quot;. In 1874, after a consultation with James Thomson, Muir adopted &quot;radian&quot;. The name &quot;radian&quot; was not universally adopted for some time after this. &quot;Longmans&#x27; School Trigonometry&quot; still called the radian &quot;circular measure&quot; when published in 1890.

In 1893 Alexander Macfarlane wrote &quot;the true analytical argument for the circular ratios is not the ratio of the arc to the radius, but the ratio of twice the area of a sector to the square on the radius.&quot; However, the paper was withdrawn from the published proceedings of mathematical congress held in connection with World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago (acknowledged at page 167), and privately published in his &quot;Papers on Space Analysis&quot; (1894). Macfarlane reached this idea or ratios of areas while considering the basis for hyperbolic angle which is analogously defined.

=== As an SI unit ===
As Paul Quincey et al. write, &quot;the status of angles within the International System of Units (SI) has long been a source of controversy and confusion.&quot; In 1960, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) established the SI and the radian was classified as a &quot;supplementary unit&quot; along with the steradian. This special class was officially regarded &quot;either as base units or as derived units&quot;, as the CGPM could not reach a decision on whether the radian was a base unit or a derived unit. Richard Nelson writes &quot;This ambiguity [in the classification of the supplemental units] prompted a spirited discussion over their proper interpretation.&quot; In May 1980 the Consultative Committee for Units (CCU) considered a proposal for making radians an SI base unit, using a constant , but turned it down to avoid an upheaval to current practice.

In October 1980 the CGPM decided that supplementary units were dimensionless derived units for which the CGPM allowed the freedom of using them or not using them in expressions for SI derived units, on the basis that &quot;[no formalism] exists which is at the same time coherent and convenient and in which the quantities plane angle and solid angle might be considered as base quantities&quot; and that &quot;[the possibility of treating the radian and steradian as SI base units] compromises the internal coherence of the SI based on only seven base units&quot;. In 1995 the CGPM eliminated the class of supplementary units and defined the radian and the steradian as &quot;dimensionless derived units, the names and symbols of which may, but need not, be used in expressions for other SI derived units, as is convenient&quot;. Mikhail Kalinin writing in 2019 has criticized the 1980 CGPM decision as &quot;unfounded&quot; and says that the 1995 CGPM decision used inconsistent arguments and introduced &quot;numerous discrepancies, inconsistencies, and contradictions in the wordings of the SI&quot;.

At the 2013 meeting of the CCU, Peter Mohr gave a presentation on alleged inconsistencies arising from defining the radian as a dimensionless unit rather than a base unit. CCU President Ian M. Mills declared this to be a &quot;formidable problem&quot; and the &quot;CCU Working Group on Angles and Dimensionless Quantities in the SI&quot; was established. The CCU met in 2021, but did not reach a consensus. A small number of members argued strongly that the radian should be a base unit, but the majority felt the status quo was acceptable or that the change would cause more problems than it would solve. A task group was established to &quot;review the historical use of SI supplementary units and consider whether reintroduction would be of benefit&quot;, among other activities.

<text>In the broader context of racism in the United States, mass racial violence in the United States consists of ethnic conflicts and race riots, along with such events as:

* Racially based communal conflicts between African Americans and White Americans which took place before the American Civil War, often in relation to attempted slave revolts, and racially based communal conflicts between African Americans and White Americans which took place after the war, in relation to tensions which existed during the Reconstruction and later efforts to suppress Black suffrage and institute Jim Crow laws 
* Conflicts between Protestants and Catholic immigrants from Ireland and Germany in the 19th century
* White American mobs frequently targeted Chinese and other Asian American immigrants during the 19th and 20th century 
* Attacks on American Indians and American settlers which took place during conflicts over land ownership (see also: Native American genocide in the United States, American Indian Wars, list of Indian massacres)
* Frequent fighting among members of various ethnic groups in major cities, specifically in the Northeastern United States and the Midwestern United States throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as the ethnic violence between Puerto Ricans and Italian Americans in New York City
* Anti-immigrant violence, specifically anti-Catholic violence which targeted Catholics in the 19th century
* Anti-immigrant violence, specifically Hispanophobic violence which targeted Latin Americans during the 20th century
* Two concurrent but distinct patterns of disturbances which occurred during the civil rights era: racial disturbances which occurred during demonstrations and protests, such as the disturbance which occurred at the Marquette Park Illinois march of August 1966 and the violence which occurred during the 1969 Greensboro uprising in North Carolina, in conjunction with the ghetto riots (1964–1969), a group of riots which includes the long, hot summer of 1967 and the King assassination riots of 1968, which caused mass violence, looting, and long-lasting damage within African American communities.

==History==

===Racial and ethnic cleansing===
Racial and ethnic cleansing was committed on a large scale after the end of the American revolution during the early period of time in the history of the United States, particularly against American Indians, who were forced off their lands and relocated to reservations. Along with them, Chinese Americans in the Pacific Northwest and African Americans throughout the United States (particularly in the American south) were rounded up and expunged from towns under threat of mob rule, the white mobs frequently intended to harm their African American targets.

===Genocide of California&#x27;s Indigenous peoples===
Following California&#x27;s transition to statehood, the California state government, incited, aided and financed miners, settlers, ranchers and people&#x27;s militias to enslave, kidnap, or murder a major proportion of California’s Indigenous people, who were sometimes contemptuously referred to as &quot;Diggers&quot;, for their practice of digging up roots to eat. California governor Peter Hardeman Burnett predicted in 1851: &quot;That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected. While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert.&quot;

California state forces, private militias, Federal reservations, and sections of the US Army all participated in the campaign that caused the deaths of many California Indians with the state and federal governments paying millions of dollars to militias to murder Indians, while many starved on Federal Reservations because of their caloric distribution reducing from 480–910 to 160–390 and between 1,680 and 3,741 California Indians were killed by the U.S. Army themselves. Between 1850 and 1852 the state appropriated almost one million dollars for the activities of militias, and between 1854 and 1859 the state appropriated another $500,000, almost half of which was reimbursed by the federal government. Guenter Lewy, famous for the phrase &quot;In the end, the sad fate of America&#x27;s Indians represents not a crime but a tragedy, involving an irreconcilable collision of cultures and values&quot; wrote that what happened in California may constitute genocide: &quot;some of the massacres in California, where both the perpetrators and their supporters openly acknowledged a desire to destroy the Indians as an ethnic entity, might indeed be regarded under the terms of the convention as exhibiting genocidal intent.&quot;

By one estimate, at least 4,500 California Indians were killed between 1849 and 1870. Contemporary historian Benjamin Madley has documented the numbers of California Indians killed between 1846 and 1873; he estimates that during this period at least 9,400 to 16,000 California Indians were killed by non-Indians. Most of the deaths took place in what he defined as more than 370 massacres (defined as the &quot;intentional killing of five or more disarmed combatants or largely unarmed noncombatants, including women, children, and prisoners, whether in the context of a battle or otherwise&quot;). Professor Ed Castillo, of Sonoma State University, estimates that more were killed: &quot;The handiwork of these well armed death squads combined with the widespread random killing of Indians by individual miners resulted in the death of 100,000 Indians in the first two years of the gold rush.&quot;

Numerous books have been written on the subject of the California Indian genocide, such as &quot;Genocide and Vendetta: The Round Valley Wars in Northern California&quot; by Lynwood Carranco and Estle Beard, &quot;Murder State: California&#x27;s Native American Genocide, 1846–1873&quot; by Brendan C. Lindsay, and &quot;An American Genocide: The United States and the California Indian Catastrophe, 1846–1873&quot; by Benjamin Madley among others. Madley&#x27;s book caused California governor Jerry Brown to recognize the genocide. In a speech before representatives of Native American peoples in June, 2019, California governor Gavin Newsom apologized for the genocide. Newsom said, &quot;That&#x27;s what it was, a genocide. No other way to describe it. And that&#x27;s the way it needs to be described in the history books.&quot;

===Anti-immigrant violence===
Riots which are defined by &quot;race&quot; have taken place between ethnic groups in the United States since at least the 18th century and they may have also occurred before it. During the early-to-mid- 19th centuries, violent rioting occurred between Protestant &quot;Nativists&quot; and recently arrived Irish Catholic immigrants.

The San Francisco Vigilance Movements of 1851 and 1856 have been described as responses to rampant crime and government corruption. But, since the late 19th century, historians have noted that the vigilantes had a nativist bias; they systematically attacked Irish immigrants, and later, they attacked Mexicans and Chileans who came as miners during the California Gold Rush, as well as Chinese immigrants. During the early 20th century, whites committed acts of racial or ethnic violence against Filipinos, Japanese, and Armenians, all of whom had arrived in California during waves of immigration.

During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Italian immigrants were subjected to racial violence. In 1891, eleven Italians were lynched by a mob of thousands in New Orleans. In the 1890s, a total of twenty Italians were lynched in the South.

===Reconstruction era (1863–1877)===
As the American Civil War ended, antislavery political forces demanded rights for ex-slaves. This led to the passage of the 14th and 15th amendments, which theoretically granted African-American and other minority males equality and voting rights. Although the federal government originally stationed troops in the South in order to protect these new freedoms, this time of progress was cut short.

By 1877, the North had lost its political will in the South and while slavery was gone, Jim Crow laws erased most of the freedoms which were guaranteed by the 14th and 15th amendments. Through violent economic tactics and legal technicalities, were gradually removed from the voting process.

===Lynching era and race riots (1878–1939)===


Lynching is defined as “a form of violence in which a mob, under the pretext of administering justice without a trial, executes a presumed offender, often after inflicting torture and corporal mutilation on him or her.” It was a particularly ritualistic form of murder, and it frequently involved the majority of the members of the local White community. Lynchings were sometimes announced in advance and they were frequently turned into spectacle lynchings which audiences could witness. The number of lynchings in the United States dropped from the 1880s to the 1920s, but there were still an average of about 30 lynchings per year during the 1920s. A study of 100 lynchings which was conducted from 1929 to 1940 revealed that at least one third of the victims were innocent of the crimes of which they were accused.

Labor and immigrant conflicts were sources of tensions that served as catalysts for the East St. Louis riot of 1917. White rioters killed an between 39 and 150 Black residents of East St. Louis, after Black residents had killed two White policemen, mistaking the car which they were riding in for another car which was full of White occupants who previously drove through a Black neighborhood and randomly fired their guns into a crowd of Black people. Other White-on-Black race riots included the Atlanta riots (1906), the Omaha and Chicago riots (1919), some of a series of riots which occurred in the volatile post-World War I environment, and the Tulsa massacre (1921).

The Chicago race riot of 1919 grew out of tensions which existed on the Southside, where Irish Americans and Black residents were crowded into substandard housing and competed with each other for jobs at the stockyards. The Irish Americans had lived in the city for a longer period of time, and they also organized themselves around athletic and political clubs. Violence broke out across the city in late July. White mobs, many of which were organized around Irish athletic clubs, pulled Black people off trolley cars, attacked Black businesses, and beat victims. City officials closed the street car system, but the rioting continued. A total of 23 Black people and 15 White people were killed.

The 1921 Tulsa race massacre took place in Greenwood, which was a prosperous Black neighborhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, home to around 10,000 Black residents and frequently called America&#x27;s Black Wall Street. The race riot was precipitated by 19-year-old Dick Rowland, a shoeshine accused of attacking 17-year-old White elevator operator Sarah Page at a department store, being arrested on May 31, 1921. On June 1, a confrontation between Black and White groups outside the courthouse led to a shootout which killed 10 Whites and 2 Blacks. The Black group then retreated back to the Greenwood District. Subsequently, a White mob attacked Black businesses, homes, and residents in the Greenwood District. The attack left over 35 city blocks burned, over 800 people injured, and between 100 and 300 people were killed. Over 6,000 Black residents were also arrested by the Oklahoma National Guard, and taken to several internment centers.

===Civil rights era (1940–1971)===
Though the Roosevelt administration, under tremendous pressure, produced anti-racist propaganda and helped push for African American employment in some cases, African Americans were still experiencing immense violence, particularly in the South. In March 1956, United States Senator Sam Ervin of North Carolina created the Southern Manifesto, which promised to fight to keep Jim Crow alive by all legal means.

This continuation of support for Jim Crow and segregation laws led to protests in which many African-Americans were violently injured out in the open at lunchroom counters, buses, polling places and local public areas. These protests did not eviscerate racism, but they prevented racism from being expressed out in the open and forced it to be expressed in more coded or metaphorical linguistic terms.

By the 1960s, decades of racial, economic, and political forces, which generated inner city poverty, resulted in race riots within minority areas in cities across the United States. The beating and rumored death of cab driver John Smith by police, sparked the 1967 Newark riots. This event became, per capita, one of the deadliest civil disturbances of the 1960s. The long and short term causes of the Newark riots are explored in depth in the documentary film &quot;Revolution &#x27;67&quot; and many news reports of the times. The riots in Newark spread across the United States in most major cities and over 100 deaths were reported. Many inner city neighborhoods in these cities were destroyed. The April 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis, Tennessee and the June assassination of Robert F. Kennedy in Los Angeles also led to nationwide rioting with similar mass deaths. During the same time period, and since then, numerous violent acts committed against African-American churches have been reported.

===Modern era (1972–present)===
Today racial violence has changed dramatically, because openly violent acts of racism are less prevalent, but acts of police brutality and the mass incarceration of racial minorities are continuing to be major issues within the United States. The war on drugs has been noted as a direct cause of the dramatic increase in the number of incarcerations in the nation&#x27;s prison system, which has risen from 300,000 in 1980 to more than 2,000,000 in 2000, though it does not account for the disproportionately high African American homicide and crime rates, which peaked before the War on Drugs began.

During the 1980s and &#x27;90s a number of riots occurred that were related to longstanding racial tensions between police and minority communities. The 1980 Miami riots were catalyzed by the killing of an African-American motorist by four white Miami-Dade Police officers. They were subsequently acquitted on charges of manslaughter and evidence tampering. Similarly, the six-day 1992 Los Angeles riots erupted after the acquittal of four white LAPD officers who had been filmed beating Rodney King, an African-American motorist. Khalil Gibran Muhammad, the Director of the Harlem-based Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture has identified more than 100 instances of mass racial violence in the United States since 1935 and has noted that almost every instance was precipitated by a police incident.

The Cincinnati riots of 2001 were caused by the killing of 19-year-old African-American Timothy Thomas by white police officer Stephen Roach, who was subsequently acquitted on charges of negligent homicide. The 2014 Ferguson unrest occurred against a backdrop of racial tension between police and the Black community of Ferguson, Missouri in the wake of the police shooting of Michael Brown; similar incidents elsewhere such as the killing of Trayvon Martin sparked smaller and isolated protests. According to the Associated Press&#x27; annual poll of United States news directors and editors, the top news story of 2014 was police killings of unarmed Black people, including Brown, as well as the investigations and the protests afterward. During the 2017 Unite the Right rally, an attendee drove his car into a crowd of people protesting the rally, killing 32-year-old Heather D. Heyer and injuring 19 others, and was indicted on federal hate crime charges.

In 2020, the police killing of Breonna Taylor and the murders of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd sparked riots in America racial unrest over systemic racism and police brutality against African Americans. Riots during the summer resulted in destruction of property, mass looting, monument removals, and incidences of violence by counter-protesters and police across the United States. The Trump administration condemned violence during the movement and responded by threatening to quell demonstrations, for which it drew criticism. In June, president Donald Trump threatened to use the military to disperse protesters by invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807. Federal law enforcement agencies were eventually deployed to assist local authorities and protect public property in Washington, D.C.

<text>Robert Leroy Johnson (May 8, 1911August 16, 1938) was an American blues musician and songwriter. His singing, guitar playing and songwriting on his landmark 1936 and 1937 recordings have influenced later generations of musicians. Although his recording career spanned only seven months, he is recognized as a master of the blues, particularly the Delta blues style, and as one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame describes him as perhaps &quot;the first ever rock star&quot;.

As a traveling performer who played mostly on street corners, in juke joints, and at Saturday night dances, Johnson had little commercial success or public recognition in his lifetime. He had only two recording sessions both produced by Don Law, one in San Antonio in 1936, and one in Dallas in 1937, that produced 29 distinct songs (with 13 surviving alternate takes). These songs, recorded solo in improvised studios, were the sum of his recorded output. Most were released as 10-inch, 78 rpm singles from , with a few released after his death. Other than these recordings, very little was known of his life outside of the small musical circuit in the Mississippi Delta where he spent most of his time. Much of his story has been reconstructed by researchers. Johnson&#x27;s poorly documented life and death have given rise to legends. The one most often associated with him is that he sold his soul to the devil at a local crossroads in return for musical success.

His music had a small, but influential, following during his life and in the decades after his death. In late 1938, John Hammond sought him out for a concert at Carnegie Hall, &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot;, only to discover that Johnson had recently died. Hammond was a producer for Columbia Records which bought Johnson&#x27;s original recordings from Brunswick Records which owned them. Musicologist Alan Lomax went to Mississippi in 1941 to record Johnson, also not knowing of his death. In 1961, Columbia released an album of Johnson&#x27;s recordings titled &quot;King of the Delta Blues Singers&quot;, produced by legendary producer and music historian Frank Driggs. It is credited with finally bringing Johnson&#x27;s work to a wider audience. The album would become influential, especially in the nascent British blues movement; Eric Clapton called Johnson &quot;the most important blues singer that ever lived&quot;. Bob Dylan, Keith Richards, and Robert Plant have cited both Johnson&#x27;s lyrics and musicianship as key influences on their own work. Many of Johnson&#x27;s songs have been covered over the years, becoming hits for other artists, and his guitar licks and lyrics have been borrowed by many later musicians.

Renewed interest in Johnson&#x27;s work and life led to a burst of scholarship starting in the 1960s. Much of what is known about him was reconstructed by researchers such as Gayle Dean Wardlow and Bruce Conforth, especially in their 2019 award-winning biography of Johnson: &quot;Up Jumped the Devil: The Real Life of Robert Johnson&quot; (Chicago Review Press). Two films, the 1991 documentary &quot;The Search for Robert Johnson&quot; by John Hammond Jr., and a 1997 documentary, &quot;Can&#x27;t You Hear the Wind Howl?: The Life &amp; Music of Robert Johnson&quot;, which included reconstructed scenes with Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; as Johnson, attempted to document his life, and demonstrated the difficulties arising from the scant historical record and conflicting oral accounts. Over the years, the significance of Johnson and his music has been recognized by the Rock and Roll, Grammy, and Blues Halls of Fame, and by the National Recording Preservation Board.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Robert Leroy Johnson was born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi, possibly on May 8, 1911, to Julia Major Dodds (born October 1874) and Noah Johnson (born December 1884). Julia was married to Charles Dodds (born February 1865), a relatively prosperous landowner and furniture maker, with whom she had ten children. Charles Dodds had been forced by a lynch mob to leave Hazlehurst following a dispute with white landowners. Julia left Hazlehurst with baby Robert, but in less than two years she brought the boy to Memphis to live with her husband, who had changed his name to Charles Spencer. Robert spent the next 8–9 years growing up in Memphis and attending the Carnes Avenue Colored School where he received lessons in arithmetic, reading, language, music, geography, and physical exercise. It was in Memphis that he acquired his love for, and knowledge of, the blues and popular music. His education and city upbringing placed him apart from most of his contemporary blues musicians.

Robert rejoined his mother around 1919–1920 after she married an illiterate sharecropper named Will &quot;Dusty&quot; Willis. They originally settled on a plantation in Lucas Township in Crittenden County, Arkansas, but soon moved across the Mississippi River to Commerce in the Mississippi Delta, near Tunica and Robinsonville. They lived on the Abbay &amp; Leatherman Plantation. Julia&#x27;s new husband was 24 years her junior. Robert was remembered by some residents as &quot;Little Robert Dusty&quot;, but he was registered at Tunica&#x27;s Indian Creek School as Robert Spencer. In the 1920 census, he is listed as Robert Spencer, living in Lucas, Arkansas, with Will and Julia Willis. Robert was at school in 1924 and 1927. The quality of his signature on his marriage certificate suggests that he was relatively well educated for a man of his background. A school friend, Willie Coffee, who was interviewed and filmed in later life, recalled that as a youth Robert was already noted for playing the harmonica and jaw harp. Coffee recalled that Robert was absent for long periods, which suggests that he may have been living and studying in Memphis.

Once Julia informed Robert about his biological father, Robert adopted the surname Johnson, using it on the certificate of his marriage to fourteen-year-old Virginia Travis in February 1929. She died in childbirth shortly after. Surviving relatives of Virginia told the blues researcher Robert &quot;Mack&quot; McCormick that this was a divine punishment for Robert&#x27;s decision to sing secular songs, known as &quot;selling your soul to the Devil&quot;. McCormick believed that Johnson himself accepted the phrase as a description of his resolve to abandon the settled life of a husband and farmer to become a full-time blues musician.

Around this time, the blues musician Son House moved to Robinsonville, where his musical partner Willie Brown lived. Late in life, House remembered Johnson as a little boy who was a competent harmonica player but an embarrassingly bad guitarist. Soon after, Johnson left Robinsonville for the area around Martinsville, close to his birthplace, possibly searching for his natural father. Here he mastered the guitar style of House and learned other styles from Isaiah &quot;Ike&quot; Zimmerman. Zimmerman was rumored to have learned supernaturally to play guitar by visiting graveyards at midnight.
When Johnson next appeared in Robinsonville, he seemed to have miraculously developed a mature guitar technique. House was interviewed at a time when the legend of Johnson&#x27;s pact with the devil was well known among blues researchers. He was asked whether he attributed Johnson&#x27;s technique to this pact, and his equivocal answers have been taken as confirmation.

While living in Martinsville, Johnson fathered a child with Vergie Mae Smith. He married Caletta Craft in May 1931. In 1932, the couple settled for a while in Clarksdale, Mississippi, in the Delta, but Johnson soon left for a career as a &quot;walking&quot; or itinerant musician, and Caletta died in early 1933.

===Itinerant musician===
From 1932 until his death in 1938, Johnson moved frequently between the cities of Memphis and Helena, and the smaller towns of the Mississippi Delta and neighboring regions of Mississippi and Arkansas. On occasion, he traveled much further. The blues musician Johnny Shines accompanied him to Chicago, Texas, New York, Canada, Kentucky, and Indiana. Henry Townsend worked with him in St. Louis. In many places he stayed with members of his large extended family or with female friends. He did not marry again but formed some long-term relationships with women to whom he would return periodically. In other places he stayed with whatever woman he was able to seduce at his performance. In each location, Johnson&#x27;s hosts were largely ignorant of his life elsewhere. He used different names in different places, employing at least eight distinct surnames.

Biographers have looked for consistency from musicians who knew Johnson in different contexts: Shines, who traveled extensively with him; Robert Lockwood Jr., who knew him as his mother&#x27;s partner; David &quot;Honeyboy&quot; Edwards, whose cousin Willie Mae Powell had a relationship with Johnson. From a mass of partial, conflicting, and inconsistent eyewitness accounts, biographers have attempted to summarize Johnson&#x27;s character. &quot;He was well mannered, he was soft spoken, he was indecipherable&quot;. &quot;As for his character, everyone seems to agree that, while he was pleasant and outgoing in public, in private he was reserved and liked to go his own way&quot;. &quot;Musicians who knew Johnson testified that he was a nice guy and fairly average—except, of course, for his musical talent, his weakness for whiskey and women, and his commitment to the road&quot;.

When Johnson arrived in a new town, he would play for tips on street corners or in front of the local barbershop or a restaurant. Musical associates have said that in live performances Johnson often did not focus on his dark and complex original compositions, but instead pleased audiences by performing more well-known pop standards of the dayand not necessarily blues. With an ability to pick up tunes at first hearing, he had no trouble giving his audiences what they wanted, and certain of his contemporaries later remarked on his interest in jazz and country music. He also had an uncanny ability to establish a rapport with his audience; in every town in which he stopped, he would establish ties to the local community that would serve him well when he passed through again a month or a year later.

Shines was 20 when he met Johnson in 1936. He estimated Johnson was maybe a year older than himself (Johnson was actually four years older). Shines is quoted describing Johnson in Samuel Charters&#x27;s &quot;Robert Johnson&quot;:
During this time Johnson established what would be a relatively long-term relationship with Estella Coleman, a woman about 15 years his senior and the mother of the blues musician Robert Lockwood Jr.. Johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in. He reputedly asked homely young women living in the country with their families whether he could go home with them, and in most cases, he was accepted, until a boyfriend arrived or Johnson was ready to move on.

In 1941, Alan Lomax learned from Muddy Waters that Johnson had performed in the area around Clarksdale, Mississippi. By 1959, the historian Samuel Charters could add only that Will Shade, of the Memphis Jug Band, remembered Johnson had once briefly played with him in West Memphis, Arkansas. In the last year of his life, Johnson is believed to have traveled to St. Louis, Chicago, Detroit, and New York City. In 1938, Columbia Records producer John H. Hammond, who owned some of Johnson&#x27;s records, directed record producer Don Law to seek out Johnson to book him for the first &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert at Carnegie Hall in New York. On learning of Johnson&#x27;s death, Hammond replaced him with Big Bill Broonzy, but he played two of Johnson&#x27;s records from the stage.

===Recording sessions===

In Jackson, Mississippi, around 1936, Johnson sought out H. C. Speir, who ran a general store and also acted as a talent scout. Speir put Johnson in touch with Ernie Oertle, who, as a salesman for the ARC group of labels, introduced Johnson to Don Law to record his first sessions in San Antonio, Texas. The recording session was held on November 23–25, 1936, in room 414 of the Gunter Hotel in San Antonio. In the ensuing three-day session, Johnson played 16 selections and recorded alternate takes for most of them. Among the songs Johnson recorded in San Antonio were &quot;I Believe I&#x27;ll Dust My Broom&quot;, &quot;Sweet Home Chicago&quot;, and &quot;Cross Road Blues&quot;, which later became blues standards. The first to be released was &quot;Terraplane Blues&quot;, backed with &quot;Last Fair Deal Gone Down&quot;, which sold as many as 10,000 copies.

Johnson traveled to Dallas, Texas, for another recording session with Don Law in a makeshift studio at the Vitagraph (Warner Bros.) Building, on June 19–20, 1937. Johnson recorded almost half of the 29 songs that make up his entire discography in Dallas and eleven records from this session were released within the following year. Most of Johnson&#x27;s &quot;somber and introspective&quot; songs and performances come from his second recording session. Johnson did two takes of most of these songs, and recordings of those takes survived. Because of this, there is more opportunity to compare different performances of a single song by Johnson than for any other blues performer of his era. In contrast to most Delta players, Johnson had absorbed the idea of fitting a composed song into the three minutes of a 78-rpm side.

==Death==
Johnson died on August 16, 1938, at the age of 27, near Greenwood, Mississippi, of unknown causes. Johnson&#x27;s death was not reported publicly. Almost 30 years later, Gayle Dean Wardlow, a Mississippi-based musicologist researching Johnson&#x27;s life, found Johnson&#x27;s death certificate, which listed only the date and location, with no official cause of death. No formal autopsy had been done. Instead, a &quot;pro forma&quot; examination was done to file the death certificate, and no immediate cause of death was determined. It is likely he had congenital syphilis and it was suspected later by medical professionals that this may have been a contributing factor in his death. However, 30 years of local oral tradition had, like the rest of his life story, built a legend which has filled in gaps in the scant historical record.

Several differing accounts have described the events preceding his death. Johnson had been playing for a few weeks at a country dance in a town about from Greenwood. According to one theory, Johnson was murdered by the jealous husband of a woman with whom he had flirted. In an account by the blues musician David &#x27;Honeyboy&#x27; Edwards, Johnson had been flirting with a married woman at a dance, and she gave him a bottle of whiskey poisoned by her husband. When Johnson took the bottle, Edwards knocked it out of his hand, admonishing him to never drink from a bottle that he had not personally seen opened. Johnson replied, &quot;Don&#x27;t ever knock a bottle out of my hand&quot;. Soon after, he was offered another (poisoned) bottle and accepted it. Johnson is reported to have begun feeling ill the evening after and had to be helped back to his room in the early morning hours. Over the next three days his condition steadily worsened. Witnesses reported that he died in a convulsive state of severe pain. The musicologist Robert &quot;Mack&quot; McCormick claimed to have tracked down the man who murdered Johnson and to have obtained a confession from him in a personal interview, but he declined to reveal the man&#x27;s name.

While strychnine has been suggested as the poison that killed Johnson, at least one scholar has disputed the notion. Tom Graves, in his book &quot;Crossroads: The Life and Afterlife of Blues Legend Robert Johnson&quot;, relies on expert testimony from toxicologists to argue that strychnine has such a distinctive odor and taste that it cannot be disguised, even in strong liquor. Graves also claims that a significant amount of strychnine would have to be consumed in one sitting to be fatal, and that death from the poison would occur within hours, not days.

In their 2019 book &quot;Up Jumped the Devil&quot;, Bruce Conforth and Gayle Dean Wardlow suggest that the poison was naphthalene, from dissolved mothballs. This was &quot;a common way of poisoning people in the rural South&quot;, but was rarely fatal. However, Johnson had been diagnosed with an ulcer and with esophageal varices, and the poison was sufficient to cause them to hemorrhage. He died after two days of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and bleeding from the mouth.

The Leflore County registrar, Cornelia Jordan, years later and after conducting an investigation into Johnson&#x27;s death for the state director of vital statistics, R. N. Whitfield, wrote a clarifying note on the back of Johnson&#x27;s death certificate:
In 2006, a medical practitioner, David Connell, suggested, on the basis of photographs showing Johnson&#x27;s &quot;unnaturally long fingers&quot; and &quot;one bad eye&quot;, that Johnson may have had Marfan syndrome, which could have both affected his guitar playing and contributed to his death due to aortic dissection.

===Gravesite===

The true location of Johnson&#x27;s grave is unknown; three different markers have been erected at possible sites in church cemeteries outside Greenwood.
*Research in the 1980s and 1990s strongly suggests Johnson was buried in the graveyard of the Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church near Morgan City, Mississippi, not far from Greenwood, in an unmarked grave. A one-ton cenotaph in the shape of an obelisk, listing all of Johnson&#x27;s song titles, with a central inscription by Peter Guralnick, was placed at this location in 1990, paid for by Columbia Records and numerous smaller contributions made through the Mount Zion Memorial Fund.

* In 1990, a small marker with the epitaph &quot;Resting in the Blues&quot; was placed in the cemetery of Payne Chapel, near Quito, Mississippi, by an Atlanta rock group named the Tombstones, after they saw a photograph in &quot;Living Blues&quot; magazine of an unmarked spot alleged by one of Johnson&#x27;s ex-girlfriends to be Johnson&#x27;s burial site.
* More recent research by Stephen LaVere (including statements from Rosie Eskridge, the wife of the supposed gravedigger, in 2000) indicates that the actual grave site is under a big pecan tree in the cemetery of the Little Zion Church, north of Greenwood along Money Road. Through LaVere, Sony Music placed a marker at this site, which bears LaVere&#x27;s name as well as Johnson&#x27;s. Researchers Bruce Conforth and Gayle Dean Wardlow also concluded this was Johnson&#x27;s resting place in their 2019 biography.
John Hammond Jr., in the documentary &quot;The Search for Robert Johnson&quot; (1991), suggests that owing to poverty and lack of transportation Johnson is most likely to have been buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave (or &quot;potter&#x27;s field&quot;) very near where he died.

==Devil legend==
According to legend, as a young man living on a plantation in rural Mississippi, Johnson had a tremendous desire to become a great blues musician. One of the legends often told says that Johnson was instructed to take his guitar to a crossroad near Dockery Plantation at midnight. (There are claims for other sites as the location of the crossroads.) There he was met by a large being (the Devil) who took the guitar and tuned it. The Devil played a few songs and then returned the guitar to Johnson, giving him mastery of the instrument. This story of a deal with the Devil at the crossroads mirrors the legend of Faust. In exchange for his soul, Johnson was able to create the blues for which he became famous.

This story was originally associated with Delta blues musician Tommy Johnson, to whom Robert Johnson was unrelated. Tommy Johnson, who grew up near the Dockery Plantation and learned the blues from Charlie Patton and Willie Brown, first claimed to have sold his soul to the devil at a crossroads in exchange for his mastery of the guitar.

===Various accounts===
This legend was developed over time and has been chronicled by Gayle Dean Wardlow, Edward Komara and Elijah Wald, who sees the legend as largely dating from Johnson&#x27;s rediscovery by white fans more than two decades after his death. Son House once told the story to Pete Welding as an explanation of Johnson&#x27;s astonishingly rapid mastery of the guitar. Other interviewers failed to elicit any confirmation from House and there were two full years between House&#x27;s observation of Johnson as first a novice and then a master.

Further details were absorbed from the imaginative retellings by Greil Marcus and Robert Palmer. Most significantly, the detail was added that Johnson received his gift from a large black man at a crossroads. There is dispute as to how and when the crossroads detail was attached to the Robert Johnson story. All the published evidence, including a full chapter on the subject in the biography &quot;Crossroads&quot;, by Tom Graves, suggests an origin in the story of the blues musician Tommy Johnson. This story was collected from his musical associate Ishman Bracey and his elder brother Ledell in the 1960s. One version of Ledell Johnson&#x27;s account was published in David Evans&#x27;s 1971 biography of Tommy Johnson, and was repeated in print in 1982 alongside House&#x27;s story in the widely read &quot;Searching for Robert Johnson&quot;, by Peter Guralnick.

In another version, Ledell placed the meeting not at a crossroads but in a graveyard. This resembles the story told to Steve LaVere that Ike Zimmerman of Hazlehurst, Mississippi, learned to play the guitar at midnight while sitting on tombstones. Zimmerman is believed to have influenced the playing of the young Johnson. Recent research by the blues scholar Bruce Conforth, in &quot;Living Blues&quot; magazine, makes the story clearer. Johnson and Ike Zimmerman did practice in a graveyard at night, because it was quiet and no one would disturb them, but it was not the Hazlehurst cemetery as had been believed: Zimmerman was not from Hazlehurst but nearby Beauregard, and he did not practice in one graveyard, but in several in the area. Johnson spent about a year living with and learning from Zimmerman, who ultimately accompanied Johnson back to the Delta to look after him.

While Dockery, Hazlehurst and Beauregard have each been claimed as the locations of the mythical crossroads, there are also tourist attractions claiming to be &quot;The Crossroads&quot; in both Clarksdale and Memphis. Residents of Rosedale, Mississippi, claim Johnson sold his soul to the devil at the intersection of Highways 1 and 8 in their town, while the 1986 movie &quot;Crossroads&quot; was filmed in Beulah, Mississippi. The blues historian Steve Cheseborough wrote that it may be impossible to discover the exact location of the mythical crossroads, because &quot;Robert Johnson was a rambling guy&quot;.

===Interpretations===
Some scholars have argued that the devil in these songs may refer not only to the Christian figure of Satan but also to the trickster god of African origin, Legba, himself associated with crossroads. Folklorist Harry M. Hyatt wrote that, during his research in the South from 1935 to 1939, when African-Americans born in the 19th or early 20th century said they or anyone else had &quot;sold their soul to the devil at the crossroads&quot;, they had a different meaning in mind. Hyatt claimed there was evidence indicating African religious retentions surrounding Legba and the making of a &quot;deal&quot; (not selling the soul in the same sense as in the Faustian tradition cited by Graves) with the so-called devil at the crossroads.

This view that the devil in Johnson&#x27;s songs is derived from an African deity was disputed by the blues scholar David Evans in an essay published in 1999, &quot;Demythologizing the Blues&quot;:

The musicologist Alan Lomax dismissed the myth, stating, &quot;In fact, every blues fiddler, banjo picker, harp blower, piano strummer and guitar framer was, in the opinion of both himself and his peers, a child of the Devil, a consequence of the black view of the European dance embrace as sinful in the extreme&quot;.

Both Lomax&#x27;s and Evans&#x27;s accounts themselves have been disputed and dismissed by Black scholars and authors including Amiri Baraka and Cornel West. West defines Blues as a creation of a people &quot;who are willing to look unflinchingly at catastrophic conditions&quot;, as children of God responding to those conditions. Baraka&#x27;s words are more directly critical of white writers who study African-American Blues artform and culture from a Western viewpoint, stating that &quot;They have to do that to make themselves superior in some kind of way: that everything has come from Europe, which is not true&quot;. Baraka cites that rather than being formed out of any Western context, Blues derives from an African context of its own. The call-and-response singing Lomax argues is different from Blues has been widely cited as being a central aspect of Blues music.

==Musical style==
Johnson is considered a master of the blues, particularly of the Delta blues style. Keith Richards, of the Rolling Stones, said in 1990, &quot;You want to know how good the blues can get? Well, this is it&quot;. But according to Elijah Wald, in his book &quot;Escaping the Delta&quot;, Johnson in his own time was most respected for his ability to play in a wide range of styles, from raw country slide guitar to jazz and pop licks, and for his ability to pick up guitar parts almost instantly upon hearing a song. His first recorded song, &quot;Kind Hearted Woman Blues&quot;, in contrast to the prevailing Delta style of the time, more resembled the style of Chicago or St. Louis, with &quot;a full-fledged, abundantly varied musical arrangement&quot;. The song was part of a cycle of spin-offs and response songs that began with Leroy Carr&#x27;s &quot;Mean Mistreater Mama&quot; (1934). According to Wald, it was &quot;the most musically complex in the cycle&quot; and stood apart from most rural blues as a thoroughly composed lyric, rather than an arbitrary collection of more or less unrelated verses. Unusual for a Delta player of the time, a recording exhibits what Johnson could do entirely outside of a blues style. &quot;They&#x27;re Red Hot&quot;, from his first recording session, shows that he was also comfortable with an &quot;uptown&quot; swing or ragtime sound similar to that of the Harlem Hamfats, but as Wald remarked, &quot;no record company was heading to Mississippi in search of a down-home Ink Spots... [H]e could undoubtedly have come up with a lot more songs in this style if the producers had wanted them.&quot;

===Voice===
An important aspect of Johnson&#x27;s singing was his use of microtonality. These subtle inflections of pitch help explain why his singing conveys such powerful emotion. Eric Clapton described Johnson&#x27;s music as &quot;the most powerful cry that I think you can find in the human voice&quot;. In two takes of &quot;Me and the Devil Blues&quot; he shows a high degree of precision in the complex vocal delivery of the last verse: &quot;The range of tone he can pack into a few lines is astonishing.&quot; The song&#x27;s &quot;hip humor and sophistication&quot; is often overlooked. &quot;[G]enerations of blues writers in search of wild Delta primitivism&quot;, wrote Wald, have been inclined to overlook or undervalue aspects that show Johnson as a polished professional performer.

Johnson is also known for using the guitar as &quot;the other vocalist in the song&quot;, a technique later perfected by B.B. King and his personified guitar named Lucille: &quot;In Africa and in Afro-American tradition, there is the tradition of the talking instrument, beginning with the drums... the one-strand and then the six-strings with bottleneck-style performance; it becomes a competing voice... or a complementary voice... in the performance&quot;.
===Instrument===

Johnson mastered the guitar, being considered today one of the all-time greats on the instrument. His approach was complex and musically advanced. When Keith Richards was first introduced to Johnson&#x27;s music by his bandmate Brian Jones, he asked, &quot;Who is the other guy playing with him?&quot;, not realizing it was Johnson playing one guitar. &quot;I was hearing two guitars, and it took a long time to actually realise he was doing it all by himself&quot;, said Richards, who later stated that &quot;Robert Johnson was like an orchestra all by himself&quot;. &quot;As for his guitar technique, it&#x27;s politely reedy but ambitiously eclectic—moving effortlessly from hen-picking and bottleneck slides to a full deck of chucka-chucka rhythm figures&quot;.

===Lyrics===
In &quot;The Story with Dick Gordon&quot;, Bill Ferris, of American Public Media, said, &quot;Robert Johnson I think of in the same way I think of the British Romantic poets, Keats and Shelley, who burned out early, who were geniuses at wordsmithing poetry... The Blues, if anything, are deeply sexual. You know, &#x27;my car doesn&#x27;t run, I&#x27;m gonna check my oil... &#x27;if you don&#x27;t like my apples, don&#x27;t shake my tree&#x27;. Every verse has sexuality associated with it&quot;.

==Influences==
Johnson fused approaches specific to Delta blues to those from the broader music world. The slide guitar work on &quot;Ramblin&#x27; on My Mind&quot; is pure Delta and Johnson&#x27;s vocal there has &quot;a touch of... Son House rawness&quot;, but the train imitation on the bridge is not at all typical of Delta blues—it is more like something out of minstrel show music or vaudeville. Johnson did record versions of &quot;Preaching the Blues&quot; and &quot;Walking Blues&quot; in the older bluesman&#x27;s vocal and guitar style (House&#x27;s chronology has been questioned by Guralnick). As with the first take of &quot;Come On in My Kitchen&quot;, the influence of Skip James is evident in James&#x27;s &quot;Devil Got My Woman&quot;, but the lyrics rise to the level of first-rate poetry, and Johnson sings with a strained voice found nowhere else in his recorded output.

The sad, romantic &quot;Love in Vain&quot; successfully blends several of Johnson&#x27;s disparate influences. The form, including the wordless last verse, follows Leroy Carr&#x27;s last hit &quot;When the Sun Goes Down&quot;; the words of the last sung verse come directly from a song Blind Lemon Jefferson recorded in 1926. Johnson&#x27;s last recording, &quot;Milkcow&#x27;s Calf Blues&quot; is his most direct tribute to Kokomo Arnold, who wrote &quot;Milkcow Blues&quot; and influenced Johnson&#x27;s vocal style.

&quot;From Four Until Late&quot; shows Johnson&#x27;s mastery of a blues style not usually associated with the Delta. He croons the lyrics in a manner reminiscent of Lonnie Johnson, and his guitar style is more that of a ragtime-influenced player like Blind Blake. Lonnie Johnson&#x27;s influence is even clearer in two other departures from the usual Delta style: &quot;Malted Milk&quot; and &quot;Drunken Hearted Man&quot;. Both copy the arrangement of Lonnie Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Life Saver Blues&quot;. The two takes of &quot;Me and the Devil Blues&quot; show the influence of Peetie Wheatstraw, calling into question the interpretation of this piece as &quot;the spontaneous heart-cry of a demon-driven folk artist&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Early recognition and reviews===
Famed producer John Hammond was an early advocate of Johnson&#x27;s music. Using the pen-name Henry Johnson, he wrote his first article on Robert Johnson for the &quot;New Masses&quot; magazine in March 1937, around the time of the release of Johnson&#x27;s first record. In it, he described Johnson as &quot;the greatest Negro blues singer who has cropped up in recent years... Johnson makes Leadbelly sound like an accomplished poseur.&quot; The following year, Hammond hoped to get Johnson to perform at a December 1938 &quot;From Spirituals to Swing&quot; concert in New York City, as he was unaware that Johnson had died in August. Instead, Hammond played two of his recordings, &quot;Walkin&#x27; Blues&quot; and &quot;Preachin&#x27; Blues (Up Jumped the Devil)&quot;, for the audience and &quot;praised Johnson lavishly from the stage&quot;. Music historian Ted Gioia noted &quot;Here, if only through the medium of recordings, Hammond used his considerable influence at this historic event to advocate a position of preeminence for the late Delta bluesman&quot;. Music educator James Perone also saw that the event &quot;underscored Robert Johnson&#x27;s specific importance as a recording artist&quot;. In 1939, Columbia issued a final single, pairing &quot;Preachin&#x27; Blues&quot; with &quot;Love in Vain&quot;.

In 1940, nine of Johnson&#x27;s songs were included on a &quot;List of American Folk Songs on Commercial Records&quot; prepared by musicologist Alan Lomax for a U.S. government conference. Lomax&#x27;s notations for the entries range from &quot;elaborate sex symbolism&quot; (&quot;Terraplane Blues&quot;), &quot;very nice love song&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m a Steady Rollin&#x27; Man&quot;), to &quot;traces of voodoo&quot; (&quot;Stones in My Passway&quot;, &quot;Hellhound on My Trail&quot;, &quot;Cross Road Blues&quot;). In 1942, commentary on Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Terraplane Blues&quot; and &quot;Last Fair Deal Gone Down&quot; appeared in &quot;The Jazz Record Book&quot;, edited by Charles Edward Smith. The authors described Johnson&#x27;s vocals as &quot;imaginative&quot; and &quot;thrilling&quot; and his guitar playing as &quot;exciting as almost anything in the folk blues field&quot;. Music writer Rudi Blesh included a review of Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Hellhound on My Trail&quot; in his 1946 book &quot;Shining Trumpets: a History of Jazz&quot;. He noted the &quot;personal and creative way&quot; Johnson approached the song&#x27;s harmony. Jim Wilson, then a writer for the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, also mentioned his unconventional use of harmony. In a 1949 review, he compared elements of John Lee Hooker&#x27;s recent debut &quot;Boogie Chillen&quot;: &quot;His [Hooker&#x27;s] dynamic rhythms and subtle nuances on the guitar and his startling disregard for familiar scale and harmony patterns show similarity to the work of Robert Johnson, who made many fine records in this vein&quot;.

Samuel Charters drew further attention to Johnson in a five-page section in his 1959 book, &quot;The Country Blues&quot;. He focused on the two Johnson recordings that referred to images of the devil or hell&quot;Hellhound on My Trail&quot; and &quot;Me and the Devil Blues&quot;to suggest that Johnson was a deeply troubled individual. Charters also included Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Preachin&#x27; Blues&quot; on the album published alongside his book. Columbia Records issued the first album of Johnson&#x27;s recordings, &quot;King of the Delta Blues Singers&quot; two years later.

===Musicianship===
Johnson is mentioned as one of the Delta artists who was a strong influence on blues singers in post-war styles. However, it is Johnson&#x27;s guitar technique that is often identified as his greatest contribution. Blues historian Edward Komara wrote:

This technique has been called a &quot;boogie bass pattern&quot; or &quot;boogie shuffle&quot; and is described as a &quot;fifth–sixth degrees of a major scale] oscillation above the root chord&quot;. Sometimes, it has been attributed to Johnnie Temple, because he was the first to record a song in 1935 using it. However, Temple confirmed that he had learned the technique from Johnson: &quot;He was the first one I ever heard use it... It was similar to a piano boogie bass [which] I learned from R. L. [Johnson] in &#x27;32 or &#x27;33&quot;. Johnny Shines added: &quot;Some of the things that Robert did with the guitar affected the way everybody played. In the early thirties, boogie was rare on the guitar, something to be heard&quot;. Conforth and Wardlow call it &quot;one of the most important riffs in blues music&quot; and music historian Peter Guralnick believes Johnson &quot;popularized a mode [walking bass style on guitar] which would rapidly become the accepted pattern&quot;. Although author Elijah Wald recognizes Johnson&#x27;s contribution in popularizing the innovation, he discounts its importance and adds, &quot;As far as the evolution of black music goes, Robert Johnson was an extremely minor figure, and very little that happened in the decades following his death would have been affected if he had never played a note&quot;.

===Contemporaries===
Johnson&#x27;s contemporaries, including Johnny Shines, Johnnie Temple, Henry Townsend, Robert Lockwood Jr., Calvin Frazier, and David &quot;Honeyboy&quot; Edwards were among those who kept his music alive through performing his songs and using his guitar techniques. Fellow Mississippi native Elmore James is the best known and is responsible for popularizing Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Dust My Broom&quot;. In 1951, he recast the song as a Chicago-style blues, with electric slide guitar and a backing band. According to blues historian Gerard Herhaft:

James&#x27; version is identified as &quot;one of the first recorded examples of what was to become the classic Chicago shuffle beat&quot;. The style often associated with Chicago blues was used extensively by Jimmy Reed beginning with his first record &quot;High and Lonesome&quot; in 1953. Sometimes called &quot;the trademark Reed shuffle&quot; (although also associated his second guitarist, Eddie Taylor), it is the figure Johnson used updated for electric guitar.

===Blues standards===
Several of Johnson&#x27;s songs became blues standards, which is used to describe blues songs that have been widely performed and recorded over a period of time and are seen as having a lasting quality. Perone notes &quot;That such a relatively high percentage of the songs attributed to him became blues standards also keeps the legacy of Robert Johnson alive&quot;. Those most often identified are &quot;Sweet Home Chicago&quot; and &quot;Dust My Broom&quot;, but also include &quot;Crossroads&quot; and &quot;Stop Breaking Down&quot;. As with many blues songs, there are melodic and lyrical precedents. While &quot;Sweet Home Chicago&quot; borrows from Kokomo Arnold&#x27;s 1933 &quot;Old Original Kokomo Blues&quot;, &quot;Johnson&#x27;s lyrics made the song a natural for Chicago bluesmen, and it&#x27;s his version that survived in the repertoires of performers like Magic Sam, Robert Lockwood, and Junior Parker&quot;.

In the first decades after Johnsons&#x27; death, these songs, with some variations in the titles and lyrics, were recorded by Tommy McClennan (1939), Walter Davis (1941), Sonny Boy Williamson I (1945), Arthur Crudup (1949), Texas Alexander (1950), Elmore James (1951–1959), Baby Boy Warren (1954), Roosevelt Sykes (1955), Junior Parker (1958), and Forest City Joe (1959). Pearson and McCulloch believe that &quot;Sweet Home Chicago&quot; and &quot;Dust My Broom&quot; in particular connect Johnson to &quot;the rightful inheritors of his musical ideas—big-city African American artists whose high-powered, electrically amplified blues remain solidly in touch with Johnson&#x27;s musical legacy&quot; at the time of Columbia&#x27;s first release of a full album of his songs in 1961.

In Jim O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s statement when Johnson was inducted into the Blues Foundation Blues Hall of Fame, he identified &quot;Hell Hound on My Trail&quot;, &quot;Sweet Home Chicago&quot;, &quot;Dust My Broom&quot;, &quot;Love in Vain&quot;, and &quot;Crossroads&quot; as Johnson&#x27;s classic recordings. Over the years, these songs have been individually inducted into the Blues Hall&#x27;s &quot;Classic of Blues RecordingSingle or Album Track&quot; category, as well as &quot;Come On in My Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Terraplane Blues&quot;.

===Rock music===
In the mid-1950s, rock and roll pioneer Chuck Berry adapted the boogie pattern on guitar for his songs &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; and &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;. Author Dave Rubin commented:

The pattern &quot;became one of the signature figures in early electric guitar-based rock and roll, such as that of Chuck Berry and the numerous rock musicians of the 1960s who were influenced by Berry&quot;, according to Perone. Although music historian Larry Birnbaum also sees the connection, he wrote that Johnson&#x27;s &quot;contributions to the origins of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll are negligible&quot;. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inducted Johnson as an early influence in its first induction ceremony, in 1986, almost a half century after his death. It also included four of his songs it deemed to have shaped the genre: &quot;Sweet Home Chicago&quot;, &quot;Cross Road Blues&quot;, &quot;Hellhound on My Trail&quot;, and &quot;Love in Vain&quot;. Marc Meyers, of the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, commented, &quot;His &#x27;Stop Breakin&#x27; Down Blues&#x27; from 1937 is so far ahead of its time that the song could easily have been a rock demo cut in 1954&quot;.

Several rock artists describe Johnson as an influence:
* Eric Clapton&quot;Robert Johnson to me is the most important blues musician who ever lived&quot;. He recorded several of Johnson&#x27;s songs as well as an entire tribute album, &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot; (2004). Clapton feels that rather than trying to recreate Johnson&#x27;s originals, &quot;I was trying to extract as much emotional content from it as I could, while respecting the form at the same time&quot;.
* Bob Dylan&quot;In about 1964 and &#x27;65, I probably used about five or six of Robert Johnson&#x27;s blues song forms, too, unconsciously, but more on the lyrical imagery side of things. If I hadn&#x27;t heard the Robert Johnson record when I did, there probably would have been hundreds of lines of mine that would have been shut down—that I wouldn&#x27;t have felt free enough or upraised enough to write. [His] code of language was like nothing I&#x27;d heard before or since&quot;.
* Robert Plant&quot;A lot of English musicians were very fired up by Robert Johnson [to] whom we all owe more or less our existence, I guess, in some way&quot;. Led Zeppelin recorded &quot;Traveling Riverside Blues&quot; and quoted some of Johnson&#x27;s lyrics in &quot;The Lemon Song&quot;.
*Keith Richards&quot;I&#x27;ve never heard anybody before or since use the [blues] form and bend it so much to make it work for himself... he came out with such compelling themes [and] just the way they were treated, apart from the music and the performance, [was appealing].&quot; The Rolling Stones recorded &quot;Love in Vain&quot; and &quot;Stop Breaking Down&quot;.
*Johnny Winter&quot;Robert Johnson knocked me out—he was a genius. [He and Son House] both were big influences on my acoustic slide playing.&quot; He recorded &quot;Dust My Broom&quot; with additional guitar by Derek Trucks.

==Problems of biography==
Until the 2019 publication of Bruce Conforth and Gayle Dean Wardlow&#x27;s biography, &quot;Up Jumped the Devil: The Real Life of Robert Johnson&quot;, little of Johnson&#x27;s early life was known. Two marriage licenses for Johnson have been located in county records offices. The ages given in these certificates point to different birth dates, but Conforth and Wardlow suggest that Johnson lied about his age in order to obtain a marriage license. Carrie Thompson claimed that her mother, who was also Robert&#x27;s mother, remembered his birth date as May8, 1911. He was not listed among his mother&#x27;s children in the 1910 census giving further credence to a 1911 birthdate. Although the 1920 census gives his age as 7, suggesting he was born in 1912 or 1913, the entry showing his attendance at Indian Creek School, in Tunica, Mississippi listed him as being 14 years old.

Five significant dates from his career are documented: Monday, Thursday and Friday, November 23, 26 and 27, 1936, at a recording session in San Antonio, Texas; and Saturday and Sunday, June 19 and 20, 1937, at a recording session in Dallas. His death certificate, discovered in 1968, lists the date and location of his death.

Record collectors admired Johnson&#x27;s records from the time of their first release, and efforts were made to discover information about him, with virtually no success. A relatively full account of Johnson&#x27;s brief musical career emerged in the 1960s, largely from accounts by Son House, Johnny Shines, David &quot;Honeyboy&quot; Edwards and Robert Jr. Lockwood. In 1961, the sleeve notes to the album &quot;King of the Delta Blues Singers&quot; included reminiscences by Don Law who had recorded Johnson in 1936. Law added to the mystique surrounding Johnson, representing him as very young and extraordinarily shy.

The blues researcher Mack McCormick began researching Johnson&#x27;s family background in 1972, but died in 2015 without publishing his findings. McCormick&#x27;s research eventually became as much a legend as Johnson himself. In 1982, McCormick permitted Peter Guralnick to publish a summary in &quot;Living Blues&quot; (1982), later reprinted in book form as &quot;Searching for Robert Johnson&quot;. Later researchers sought to confirm this account or to add minor details. A revised summary acknowledging major contributors was written by Stephen LaVere for the booklet accompanying &quot;Robert Johnson, The Complete Recordings&quot; box set (1990). The documentary film &quot;The Search for Robert Johnson&quot; contains accounts by McCormick and Wardlow of what informants have told them: long interviews of David &quot;Honeyboy&quot; Edwards and Johnny Shines and short interviews of surviving friends and family. Another film, &quot;Can&#x27;t You Hear the Wind Howl?: The Life &amp; Music of Robert Johnson&quot;, combines documentary segments with recreated scenes featuring Keb&#x27; Mo&#x27; as Johnson with narration by Danny Glover. Shines, Edwards and Robert Jr. Lockwood contribute interviews. These published biographical sketches achieve coherent narratives, partly by ignoring reminiscences and hearsay accounts which contradict or conflict with their accounts.

===Photographs===
Until the 1980s, it was believed that no images of Johnson had survived. However, three images of Johnson were located in 1972 and 1973, in the possession of his half-sister Carrie Thompson. Two of these, known as the &quot;dime-store photo&quot; (December 1937 or January 1938) and the &quot;studio portrait&quot; (summer 1936), were copyrighted by Stephen LaVere (who had obtained them from the Thompson family) in 1986 and 1989, respectively, with an agreement to share any ensuing royalties 50% with the Johnson estate, at that time administered by Thompson. The &quot;dime-store photo&quot; was first published, almost in passing, in an issue of Rolling Stone magazine in 1986, and the studio portrait in a 1989 article by Stephen Calt and Gayle Dean Wardlow in &quot;78 Quarterly&quot;. Both were subsequently featured prominently in the printed materials associated with the 1990 CBS box set of the &quot;complete&quot; Johnson recordings, as well as being widely republished since that time. Because Mississippi courts in 1998 determined that Robert Johnson&#x27;s heir was Claud Johnson, a son born out of wedlock, the estate share of all monies paid to LaVere by CBS and others ended up going to Claud Johnson, and attempts by the heirs of Carrie Thompson to obtain a ruling that the photographs were her personal property and not part of the estate were dismissed. In his book &quot;Searching for Robert Johnson&quot;, Peter Guralnick stated that the blues archivist Mack McCormick showed him a photograph of Johnson with his nephew Louis, taken at the same time as the famous &quot;pinstripe suit&quot; photograph, showing Louis dressed in his United States Navy uniform; this picture, along with the &quot;studio portrait&quot;, were both lent by Carrie Thompson to McCormick in 1972. McCormick never returned the photograph of Johnson in his uniform, keeping it in his archive until his death. McCormick&#x27;s daughter donated the archive to the Smithsonian Institution in 2020 and encouraged museum staff to facilitate the return of the photograph to Johnson&#x27;s descendants; as of 2023, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the museum had agreed to return the photograph and was awaiting instructions from the Johnson family. This photograph has never been made public.

Another photograph, purporting to show Johnson posing with the blues musician Johnny Shines, was published in the November 2008 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine. Its authenticity was claimed by the forensic artist Lois Gibson and by Johnson&#x27;s estate in 2013, but has been disputed by some music historians, including Elijah Wald, Bruce Conforth and Gayle Dean Wardlow, who considered that the clothing suggests a date after Johnson&#x27;s death and that the photograph may have been reversed and retouched. Further, both &quot;Honeyboy&quot; Edwards and Robert Jr. Lockwood failed to identify either man in the photo. Facial recognition software concluded that neither man was Johnson or Shines. Finally, Gibson claimed the photo was from 1933 to 1934 but it is known that Johnson did not meet Shines until early 1937. In December 2015, a fourth photograph was published, purportedly showing Johnson, his wife Calletta Craft, Estella Coleman, and Robert Lockwood Jr. This photograph was also declared authentic by Lois Gibson, but her identification of Johnson has been dismissed by other facial recognition experts and blues historians. There are a number of reasons why the photograph is unlikely to be Johnson: it has been proven that Craft died before Johnson met Coleman, the clothing could not be prior to the late 1940s, the furniture is from the 1950s, the Coca-Cola bottle cannot be from prior to 1950, etc.

A third photograph of Johnson, this time smiling, was published in 2020. It is believed to have been taken in Memphis on the same occasion as the verified photograph of him with a guitar and cigarette (part of the &quot;dime-store&quot; set), and is in the possession of Annye Anderson, Johnson&#x27;s step-sister (Anderson is the daughter of Charles Dodds, later Spencer, who was married to Robert&#x27;s mother but was not his father). As a child, Anderson grew up in the same family as Johnson and has claimed to have been present, aged 10 or 11, on the occasion the photograph was taken. This photograph was published in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in May 2020, as the cover image for a book, &quot;Brother Robert: Growing Up with Robert Johnson&quot;, written by Anderson in collaboration with author Preston Lauterbach, and is considered to be authentic by Johnson scholar Elijah Wald.

===Descendants===
Johnson left no will. In 1998, the Mississippi Supreme Court ruled that Claud Johnson, a retired truck driver living in Crystal Springs, Mississippi, was the son of Robert Johnson and his only heir. The court heard that he had been born to Virgie Jane Smith (later Virgie Jane Cain), who had a relationship with Robert Johnson in 1931. The relationship was attested to by a friend, Eula Mae Williams, but other relatives descended from Robert Johnson&#x27;s half-sister, Carrie Harris Thompson, contested Claud Johnson&#x27;s claim. The effect of the judgment was to allow Claud Johnson to receive over $1 million in royalties. Claud Johnson died, aged 83, on June 30, 2015, leaving six children.

==Discography==

Eleven 78-rpm records by Johnson were released by Vocalion Records in 1937 and 1938, with additional pressings by ARC budget labels. In 1939, a twelfth was issued posthumously. Johnson&#x27;s estate holds the copyrights to his songs. In 1961, Columbia Records released &quot;King of the Delta Blues Singers&quot;, an album representing the first modern-era release of Johnson&#x27;s performances, which started the &quot;re-discovery&quot; of Johnson as blues artist. In 1970, Columbia issued a second volume, &quot;King of the Delta Blues Singers, Vol. II&quot;.

&quot;The Complete Recordings&quot;, a two-disc set, released on August 28, 1990, contains almost everything Johnson recorded, with all 29 recordings, and 12 alternate takes. Another alternate take of &quot;Traveling Riverside Blues&quot; was released by Sony on the CD reissue of &quot;King of the Delta Blues Singers&quot;. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of Johnson&#x27;s birth, May 8, 2011, Sony Legacy released &quot;Robert Johnson: The Centennial Collection&quot;, a re-mastered 2-CD set of all 42 of his recordings and two brief fragments, one of Johnson practicing a guitar figure and the other of Johnson saying, presumably to engineer Don Law, &quot;I wanna go on with our next one myself&quot;. One reviewer commented that the sound quality of the 2011 release was a slight improvement on the 1990 release.

==In popular culture==
He is often considered the first member of the so-called &quot;27 Club&quot;, a group of musicians who have died at that age.

Robert Johnson was played by La Monde Byrd in Supernatural (American TV series) season 2 episode 8 &quot;Crossroad Blues&quot;.

In 1994, Johnson was featured on a U.S. postage stamp.

The Tim McGraw song &quot;How Bad Do You Want It&quot; off the 2004 album &quot;Live Like You Were Dying&quot; opens with the lines &quot;Robert Johnson went to the crossroads, so the legend goes/He left with his guitar, but the Devil took his soul, the Devil took his soul&quot;.

In season 2 episode 6 of the NBC sci-fi time-travel series &quot;Timeless&quot;, &quot;King of The Delta Blues&quot;, the protagonists travel back to San Antonio in 1936 when Robert Johnson (portrayed by Kamahl Naiqui) and Don Law (played by Gavin Stenhouse) were recording Johnson&#x27;s first album in a hotel room. The episode incorporates a bit of Johnson&#x27;s singing and playing.

&quot;Me and the Devil Blues&quot;, a Japanese manga series that takes its title from the song of the same name by Robert Johnson, chronicles a fictional version of Johnson&#x27;s life, as a man called &quot;RJ&quot; who sells his soul to the devil for a talent for playing the blues.

The 2021 song &quot;Speechless&quot; by Nas includes the lyrics &quot;I went back into my past and then I sped it up/Robert Johnson, Winehouse and Morrison found where heaven was...&quot;

In 2024, an episode of the British TV crime drama McDonald &amp; Dodds featured the murder of a Blues enthusiast involved in seeking to identify the crossroads at which Robert Johnson had supposedly met the Devil. Entitled &quot;Jinksy Sings the Blues&quot;, it was Episode 2 of Series 4 and was broadcast in the UK on 28 July 2024.

<text>Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia, also known as receptive aphasia, sensory aphasia, fluent aphasia, or posterior aphasia, is a type of aphasia in which individuals have difficulty understanding written and spoken language. Patients with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia demonstrate fluent speech, which is characterized by typical speech rate, intact syntactic abilities and effortless speech output. Writing often reflects speech in that it tends to lack content or meaning. In most cases, motor deficits (i.e. hemiparesis) do not occur in individuals with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia. Therefore, they may produce a large amount of speech without much meaning. Individuals with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia often suffer of anosognosia – they are unaware of their errors in speech and do not realize their speech may lack meaning. They typically remain unaware of even their most profound language deficits.

Like many acquired language disorders, Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia can be experienced in many different ways and to many different degrees. Patients diagnosed with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia can show severe language comprehension deficits; however, this is dependent on the severity and extent of the lesion. Severity levels may range from being unable to understand even the simplest spoken and/or written information to missing minor details of a conversation. Many diagnosed with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia have difficulty with repetition in words and sentences and/or working memory.

Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia was named after German physician Carl Wernicke, who is credited with discovering the area of the brain responsible for language comprehension (Wernicke&#x27;s area) and discovery of the condition which results from a lesion to this brain area (Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia). Although Wernicke&#x27;s area (left posterior superior temporal cortex) is known as the language comprehension area of the brain, defining the exact region of the brain is a more complicated issue. A 2016 study aimed to determine the reliability of current brain models of the language center of the brain. After asking a group of neuroscientists what portion of the brain they consider to be Wernicke&#x27;s area, results suggested that the classic &quot;Wernicke-Lichtheim-Geschwind&quot; model is no longer adequate for defining the language areas of the brain. This is because this model was created using an old understanding of human brain anatomy and does not take into consideration the cortical and subcortical structures responsible for language or the connectivity of brain areas necessary for production and comprehension of language. While there is not a well defined area of the brain for language comprehension, Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia is a known condition causing difficulty with understanding language.

==Signs and symptoms==
The following are common symptoms seen in patients with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia:
* &quot;Impaired comprehension&quot;: deficits in understanding (receptive) written and spoken language. This is because Wernicke&#x27;s area is responsible for assigning meaning to the language that is heard, so if it is damaged, the brain cannot comprehend the information that is being received.
* &quot;Poor word retrieval&quot;: ability to retrieve target words is impaired. This is also referred to as anomia, and it is often classified into the following subsets:
** &quot;Word-selection anomia&quot;: this type of anomia describes patients who know the function of a certain object, and can single out the target object from a larger group of objects, but they do not have the ability to name the object. For example when shown different clothes items and asked to select the one meant to keep their head warm, they will correctly select the hat, but will not be able to state the name of the object. In some patients this type of anomia is specific to certain categories like colors or animals.
** &quot;Semantic anomia&quot;: unlike patients with word-selection anomia, patients exhibiting semantic anomia also lose the ability to correctly distinguish the function or use of a given object, along with not being able to provide the name of it. Therefore, even provided with both the name and function of an object, these patients still would not be able to correctly select it out of a group.
** &quot;Disconnection anomia or modality-specific anomia&quot;: this subset of anomia affects patients&#x27; ability to name or distinguish objects if they are presented through a certain sensory modality, and is caused by a disconnect between the given sensory cortex and the language centers of the brain. For example, a patient may be able to distinguish an apple from a banana when presented with their given smells, but not when they are presented the objects through only touch.
** &quot;Phonemic substitution anomia&quot;: describes patients that exhibit paraphasia when trying to name objects. This can result in patients either selecting incorrect phonemes, such as saying &#x27;bad&#x27; when shown an image of a &#x27;bat&#x27;, or they may simply try to use non-real words, or neologisms.
* &quot;Neologisms&quot;: Neologism is a Greek-derived word meaning &quot;new word&quot;. The term is used in this sense to mean invented non-words that have no relation to the target word.
** E.g. &quot;dorflur&quot; for &quot;shoe&quot;
* &quot;Production of jargon&quot;: speech that lacks content, consists of typical intonation, and is structurally intact. Jargon can consist of a string of neologisms, as well as a combination of real words that do not make sense together in context. The jargon may include word salads.
* &quot;Fluent speech&quot;: individuals with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia do not have difficulty with producing connected speech that flows. Although the connection of the words may be appropriate, the words they are using may not belong together or make sense (Jargon). Some patients with Wernicke&#x27;s Aphasia experience logorrhea, which is also known as over fluency. These patients use an excessive amount of words when speaking or writing. 
* &quot;Awareness&quot;: Individuals with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia are often not aware of their incorrect productions, which would further explain why they do not correct themselves when they produce jargon, paraphasias, or neologisms. Additionally, patients may become irritated or frustrated because others cannot understand what they are saying, but they believe their speech is completely comprehensible.
* &quot;Paraphasias&quot;:
** &quot;Phonemic&quot; (literal) &quot;paraphasia&quot;: Errors in selecting phonemes. Involves the substitution, addition, omission, or rearrangement of sounds so that an error can be defined as sounding like the target word. Often, half of the word is still intact which allows for easy comparison to the appropriate, original word (E.g. &quot;bap&quot; for &quot;map&quot;). The more phonemic paraphasias in a word, the harder it is to understand, to the extent at which may become unidentifiable. Often, these unidentifiable words are known as neologisms.
** &quot;Semantic&quot; (verbal) &quot;paraphasia&quot;: Failure to select the proper words with which to convey their ideas. The word used is always a real word, however it may not always be directly or closely related to the word the patient is trying to convey. Can result in saying a word that is related to the target word in meaning or category (E.g. &quot;jet&quot; for &quot;airplane&quot; or &quot;knife&quot; for &quot;fork&quot;). Other times, semantic paraphasias can result in empty speech, or the use of overly generic words such as &quot;thing&quot; or &quot;stuff&quot; to stand in for the word they cannot come up with. This leads to speech that contains real words but lacks any substantial meaning.
* &quot;Circumlocution&quot;: talking around the target word.
** E.g. &quot;uhhh it&#x27;s white... it&#x27;s flat... you write on it...&quot; (when referencing paper)
* &quot;Pressured speech&quot;: Wernicke&#x27;s patient&#x27;s inclination to run on their speech. Often described as an overabundance of speech. Common in Wernicke&#x27;s patients due to the ease at which they produce speech, circumlocution, and lack of self-monitoring.
** E.g. a clinician asks, &quot;what do you do at a supermarket?&quot; And the individual responds with &quot;Well, the supermarket is a place. It is a place with a lot of food. My favorite food is Italian food. At a supermarket, I buy different kinds of food. There are carts and baskets. Supermarkets have lots of customers, and workers...&quot;
* &quot;Lack of hemiparesis&quot;: typically, no motor deficits are seen with a localized lesion in Wernicke&#x27;s area.
* &quot;Reduced retention span&quot;: reduced ability to retain information for extended periods of time.
* &quot;Impairments in reading and writing&quot;: impairments can be seen in both reading and writing with differing severity levels.

Distinction from other types of aphasia/other conditions
* &quot;Expressive aphasia&quot; (non-fluent Broca&#x27;s aphasia): this is generally considered the second main categorization of aphasia, where individuals have great difficulty forming complete sentences with generally only basic content words (leaving out words like &quot;is&quot; and &quot;the&quot;). Unlike Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia, which causes patients to speak fluently, but producing a jumbled mix of nonsensical words, people with Broca&#x27;s aphasia speak slowly, and typically in small sentences, yet they are much more able to convey the intended meaning of the sentence. Additionally, while people with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia typically are unaware of their confusing language and may get frustrated with the listener for not understanding them, people with Broca&#x27;s aphasia are completely aware of their language difficulties and can sometimes become frustrated with themselves. 
* &quot;Global aphasia&quot;: individuals have extreme difficulties with both expressive (producing language) and receptive (understanding language).
* &quot;Anomic aphasia&quot;: the biggest hallmark is one&#x27;s poor word-finding abilities; one&#x27;s speech is fluent and appropriate, but full of circumlocutions (evident in both writing and speech).
* &quot;Conduction aphasia&quot;: individuals can comprehend what is being said and are fluent in spontaneous speech, but they cannot repeat what is being said to them.
* &quot;Transcortical sensory aphasia&quot;: individuals have impaired auditory comprehension with intact repetition and fluent speech.
* &quot;Progressive confluent aphasia&quot;: A form of frontotemporal dementia characterized by motor speech impairment, agrammatism, laborious speech, and apraxia of speech. It is understood that comprehension of speech and semantic memory are relatively preserved. Symptoms progress over time unlike many other aphasias where symptoms appear immediately after stroke.
* Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome: A well described syndrome of neurological and cognitive problems that comprises both Wernicke&#x27;s Encephalopathy (WE) and Korsakoff Syndrome (KS). It is often characterized by impairment in memory formation and is caused by long term thiamine deficiency.

==Causes==

The most common cause of Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia is stroke. Strokes may occur when blood flow to the brain is completely interrupted or severely reduced. This has a direct effect on the amount of oxygen and nutrients being able to supply the brain, which causes brain cells to die within minutes.

The most common stroke that causes Wernicke&#x27;s Aphasia is an ischemic stroke affecting the posterior temporal lobe of the dominant hemisphere of the brain.

&quot;The middle cerebral arteries supply blood to the cortical areas involved in speech, language and swallowing. The left middle cerebral artery provides Broca&#x27;s area, Wernicke&#x27;s area, Heschl&#x27;s gyrus, and the angular gyrus with blood&quot;. Therefore, in patients with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia, there is typically an occlusion to the left middle cerebral artery.

As a result of the occlusion in the left middle cerebral artery, Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia is most commonly caused by a lesion in the posterior superior temporal gyrus (Wernicke&#x27;s area). This area is posterior to the primary auditory cortex (PAC) which is responsible for decoding individual speech sounds. Wernicke&#x27;s primary responsibility is to assign meaning to these speech sounds. The extent of the lesion will determine the severity of the patients deficits related to language. Damage to the surrounding areas (perisylvian region) may also result in Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia symptoms due to variation in individual neuroanatomical structure and any co-occurring damage in adjacent areas of the brain.

Another common cause of Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia is encephalitis, specifically around the posterior superior temporal gyrus. Encephalitis is the inflammation of the brain, which can be a result of infection, autoimmune disorders, or chronic substance abuse, among others. 

Other causes of Wernicke&#x27;s Aphasia include brain trauma, cerebral tumors, central nervous system (CNS) infections, and degenerative brain disorders.

In the case of brain tumors, infections, or degenerative brain disorders, examples in which damage to the brain can be ongoingly progressive, it is likely that the aphasia will coincidingly progress as well, and symptoms will worsen if the cause is not treated.

==Diagnosis==

Aphasia is usually first recognized by the physician who treats the person for his or her brain injury. Most individuals will undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan to confirm the presence of a brain injury and to identify its precise location. In circumstances where a person is showing possible signs of aphasia, the physician will refer him or her to a speech-language pathologist (SLP) for a comprehensive speech and language evaluation. SLPs will examine the individual&#x27;s ability to express him or herself through speech, understand language in written and spoken forms, write independently, and perform socially.

The American Speech, Language, Hearing Association (ASHA) states a comprehensive assessment should be conducted in order to analyze the patient&#x27;s communication functioning on multiple levels; as well as the effect of possible communication deficits on activities of daily living. Typical components of an aphasia assessment include: case history, self report, oral-motor examination, language skills, identification of environmental and personal factors, and the assessment results. A comprehensive aphasia assessment includes both formal and informal measures.

Formal assessments include:
* Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE): diagnoses the presence and type of aphasia, focusing on location of lesion and the underlying linguistic processes.  
* Western Aphasia Battery – Revised (WAB): determines the presence, severity, and type of aphasia; and can also determine baseline abilities of patient.
* Communication Activities of Daily Living - Second Edition (CADL-2): measures functional communication abilities; focuses on reading, writing, social interactions, and varying levels of communication.
* Revised Token Test (RTT): assess receptive language and auditory comprehension; focuses on patient&#x27;s ability to follow directions.

Informal assessments, which aid in the diagnosis of patients with suspected aphasia, include:
* Conversational speech and language sample
* Family interview
* Case history or medical chart review
* Behavioral observations

Diagnostic information should be scored and analyzed appropriately. Treatment plans and individual goals should be developed based on diagnostic information, as well as patient and caregiver needs, desires, and priorities.

==Treatment==

There is currently no standardized treatment for Wernicke&#x27;s Aphasia, meaning treatment varies from patient to patient depending on the severity of the lesion and the resulting deficits. In some patients, the first step of action is to attempt to treat the possible causes for the aphasia, such as removing a brain tumor, or treating a nervous system infection. This may not lessen the symptoms for the patient as damage to the brain is often already done, but it typically stops the aphasia from worsening. For the majority of patients with any kind of aphasia, speech and language therapy is the primary treatment. This focuses on improving language skills and learning how to communicate in various ways to allow their needs to be met. Since Wernicke&#x27;s patients face comprehension deficits, they are often unaware of their condition and may pose unique challenges for their treatment because of this lack of awareness or concern for their deficit. Treatment plans are usually devised by a team of healthcare workers including a speech therapist, neuropsychologist, and a neurologist.

According to Bates et al. (2005), &quot;the primary goal of rehabilitation is to prevent complications, minimize impairments, and maximize function&quot;. The topics of intensity and timing of intervention are widely debated across various fields. Results are contradictory: some studies indicate better outcomes with early intervention, while other studies indicate starting therapy too early may be detrimental to the patient&#x27;s recovery. Recent research suggests, that therapy be functional and focus on communication goals that are appropriate for the patient&#x27;s individual lifestyle.

Specific treatment considerations for working with individuals with Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia (or those who exhibit deficits in auditory comprehension) include using familiar materials, using shorter and slower utterances when speaking, giving direct instructions, and using repetition as needed.

=== Role of neuroplasticity in recovery ===

Neuroplasticity is defined as the brain&#x27;s ability to reorganize itself, lay new pathways, and rearrange existing ones, as a result of experience. Neuronal changes after damage to the brain such as collateral sprouting, increased activation of the homologous areas, and map extension demonstrate the brain&#x27;s neuroplastic abilities. According to Thomson, &quot;Portions of the right hemisphere, extended left brain sites, or both have been shown to be recruited to perform language functions after brain damage. All of the neuronal changes recruit areas not originally or directly responsible for large portions of linguistic processing. Principles of neuroplasticity have been proven effective in neurorehabilitation after damage to the brain. These principles include: incorporating multiple modalities into treatment to create stronger neural connections, using stimuli that evoke positive emotion, linking concepts with simultaneous and related presentations, and finding the appropriate intensity and duration of treatment for each individual patient.

=== Auditory comprehension treatment ===
Auditory comprehension is a primary focus in treatment for Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia, as it is the main deficit related to this diagnosis. Therapy activities may include:
* Single-word comprehension: A common treatment method used to support single-word comprehension skills is known as a pointing drill. Through this method, clinicians lay out a variety of images in front of a patient. The patient is asked to point to the image that corresponds to the word provided by the clinician.
* Understanding spoken sentences: &quot;Treatment to improve comprehension of spoken sentences typically consists of drills in which patients answer questions, follow directions or verify the meaning of sentences&quot;.
* Understanding conversation: An effective treatment method to support comprehension of discourse includes providing a patient with a conversational sample and asking him or her questions about that sample. Individuals with less severe deficits in auditory comprehension may also be able to retell aspects of the conversation.

=== Word retrieval ===
Anomia is consistently seen in aphasia, so many treatment techniques aim to help patients with word finding problems. One example of a semantic approach is referred to as semantic feature analyses. The process includes naming the target object shown in the picture and producing words that are semantically related to the target. Through production of semantically similar features, participants develop more skills in naming stimuli due to the increase in lexical activation.

=== Restorative therapy approach ===
Neuroplasticity is a central component to restorative therapy to compensate for brain damage. This approach is especially useful in Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia patients that have had a stroke to the left brain hemisphere.

&quot;Schuell&#x27;s stimulation approach&quot; is a main method in traditional aphasia therapy that follows principles to retrieve function in the auditory modality of language and influence surrounding regions through stimulation. The guidelines to have the most effective stimulation are as follows:
Auditory stimulation of language should be intensive and always present when other language modalities are stimulated.
* The stimulus should be presented at a difficulty level equal to or just below the patient&#x27;s ability.
* Sensory stimulation must be present and repeated throughout the treatment.
* Each stimulus applied should produce a response; if there is no response more stimulation cues should be provided.
* Response to stimuli should be maximized to create more opportunities for success and feedback for the speech-language pathologist.
* The feedback of the speech-language pathologist should promote further success and patient and encouragement.
* Therapy should follow an intensive and systemic method to create success by progressing in difficulty.
* Therapies should be varied and build off of mastered therapy tasks.

Schuell&#x27;s stimulation utilizes stimulation through therapy tasks beginning at a simplified task and progressing to become more difficult including:
* Point to tasks. During these tasks the patient is directed to point to an object or multiple objects. As the skill is learned the level of complexity increases by increasing the number of objects the patient must point to.
** Simple: &quot;Point to the book.&quot;
** Complex: &quot;Point to the book and then to the ceiling after touching your ear.&quot;
* Following directions with objects. During these tasks the patient is instructed to follow the instruction of manually following directions that increase in complexity as the skill is learned.
** Simple: &quot;Pick up the book.&quot;
** Complex: &quot;Pick up the book and put it down on the bench after I move the cup.&quot;
* Yes or no questions – This task requires the patient to respond to various yes or no questions that can range from simple to complex.
** Paraphrasing and retelling – This task requires the patient to read a paragraph and, afterwards, paraphrase it aloud. This is the most complex of Schuell&#x27;s stimulation tasks because it requires comprehension, recall, and communication.

=== Social approach to treatment ===
The social approach involves a collaborative effort on behalf of patients and clinicians to determine goals and outcomes for therapy that could improve the patient&#x27;s quality of life. A conversational approach is thought to provide opportunities for development and the use of strategies to overcome barriers to communication. The main goals of this treatment method are to improve the patient&#x27;s conversational confidence and skills in natural contexts using conversational coaching, supported conversations, and partner training.
* Conversational coaching involves patients with aphasia and their speech language pathologists, who serve as a &quot;coach&quot; discussing strategies to approach various communicative scenarios. The &quot;coach&quot; will help the patient develop a script for a scenario (such as ordering food at a restaurant), and help the patient practice and perform the scenario in and out of the clinic while evaluating the outcome.
* Supported conversation also involves using a communicative partner who supports the patient&#x27;s learning by providing contextual cues, slowing their own rate of speech, and increasing their message&#x27;s redundancy to promote the patient&#x27;s comprehension.
Additionally, it is important to include the families of patients with aphasia in treatment programs. Clinicians can teach family members how to support one another, and how to adjust their speaking patterns to facilitate their loved one&#x27;s treatment and rehabilitation.

Speech devices, while not a treatment that can improve a patient&#x27;s language skills, help the patient communicate with caregivers through the use of pictures or speech.

=== Clinical trials ===
More recently, researchers are developing medical treatments for aphasia using clinical trials for pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches. Some medications include drugs affecting the catecholaminergic system, nootropic drugs, and medications used to treat Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The non-pharmacological approaches include transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct stimulation.

==Prognosis==
Prognosis is strongly dependent on the location and extent of the lesion (damage) to the brain. Many personal factors also influence how a person will recover, which include age, previous medical history, level of education, gender, and motivation. All of these factors influence the brain&#x27;s ability to adapt to change, restore previous skills, and learn new skills. It is important to remember that all the presentations of Receptive Aphasia may vary. The presentation of symptoms and prognosis are both dependent on personal components related to the individual&#x27;s neural organization before the stroke, the extent of the damage, and the influence of environmental and behavioral factors after the damage occurs. The quicker a diagnosis of a stroke is made by a medical team, the more positive the patient&#x27;s recovery may be. A medical team will work to control the signs and symptoms of the stroke and rehabilitation therapy will begin to manage and recover lost skills. The rehabilitation team may consist of a certified speech-language pathologist, physical therapist, occupational therapist, and the family or caregivers. The length of therapy will be different for everyone, but research suggests that intense therapy over a short amount of time can improve outcomes of speech and language therapy for patients with aphasia. Research is not suggesting the only way therapy should be administered, but gives insight on how therapy affects the patient&#x27;s prognosis.

<text>Rehoboam (; , , ; , ; ) was, according to the Hebrew Bible, the first monarch of the Kingdom of Judah after the split of the united Kingdom of Israel. He was a son of and the successor to Solomon and a grandson of David.

In the account of I Kings and II Chronicles, Rehoboam saw his rule limited to only the Kingdom of Judah in the south following a rebellion by the ten northern tribes of Israel in 932/931 BCE, which led to the formation of the independent Kingdom of Israel under the rule of Jeroboam in the north.
Extrabiblical evidence for Judah’s stability under Rehoboam is limited, with indications that the biblical accounts of Rehoboam and Jeroboam may be retrojections.

== Background ==

According to the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;, &quot;Solomon&#x27;s wisdom and power were not sufficient to prevent the rebellion of several of his border cities. Damascus under Rezon secured its independence [from] Solomon; and Jeroboam, a superintendent of works, his ambition stirred by the words of the prophet Ahijah, fled to Egypt. Thus, before the death of Solomon, the apparently unified kingdom of David began to disintegrate. With Damascus independent and a powerful man of Ephraim, the most prominent of the Ten Tribes, awaiting his opportunity, the future of Solomon&#x27;s kingdom became dubious&quot;.

According to First Book of Kings 11:1–13, Solomon had broken the mandate of the Torah by marrying foreign wives and being influenced by them, worshipping and building shrines to the Moabite and Ammonite gods:
Rehoboam&#x27;s mother, Naamah, was an Ammonitess, and thus one of the foreign wives whom Solomon married. In the Revised Version she is referred to as &quot;the Ammonitess&quot;.

== Reign ==
=== Accession to the throne ===
Conventional biblical chronology dates the start of Rehoboam&#x27;s reign to the mid-10th century BC. His reign is described in 1 Kings 12 and 1 Kings 14:21–31 and in 2 Chronicles in the Hebrew Bible. Rehoboam was 41 years old (16 in Chapter 12 of 3 Kings in the Septuagint) when he ascended the throne.
The ten northern tribes assembled at Shechem to proclaim Rehoboam King of Israel. At the assembly, the tribes requested certain reforms in the policy followed by Rehoboam&#x27;s father, Solomon. The reforms requested would materially reduce the royal exchequer and hence its power to continue the magnificence of Solomon&#x27;s court. The older men counselled Rehoboam at least to speak to the people in a civil manner (it is not clear whether they counselled him to accept the demands). However, the new king sought the advice from the young men with which he had grown up, who advised the king to show no weakness to the people, and to tax them even more, which Rehoboam did.

Although the ostensible reason was the heavy burden laid upon Israel because of Solomon&#x27;s great outlay for buildings and for luxury of all kinds, the other reasons include the historical opposition between the north and the south. The two sections had acted independently until David, by his victories, succeeded in uniting all the tribes, though the Ephraimitic jealousy was ever ready to develop into open revolt. Religious considerations were also operative. The building of the Temple was a severe blow for the various sanctuaries scattered through the land, and the priests of the high places probably supported the revolt. Josephus (Ant., VIII., viii. 3) has the rebels exclaim: &quot;We leave to Rehoboam the Temple his father built.&quot;

Jeroboam and the people rebelled, with the ten northern tribes breaking away and forming a separate kingdom. The new breakaway kingdom continued to be called Kingdom of Israel and was also known as Samaria, or Ephraim or the northern kingdom. The realm Rehoboam was left with was called Kingdom of Judah.

During Rehoboam&#x27;s 17-year reign, he retained Jerusalem as Judah&#x27;s capital but
=== Civil war ===
Rehoboam went to war against the new Kingdom of Israel with a force of 180,000 soldiers. However, he was advised against fighting his brethren and so returned to Jerusalem. The narrative reports that Israel and Judah were in a state of war throughout his 17-year reign.

=== Egyptian invasion ===

In the fifth year of Rehoboam&#x27;s reign, Shishak, king of Egypt, brought a huge army and took many cities. According to Joshua, son of Nadav, the mention in 2 Chronicles 11, 6 sqq., that Rehoboam built fifteen fortified cities, indicates that the attack was not unexpected. The account in Chronicles states that Shishak marched with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horsemen and troops who came with him from Egypt: Libyans, Sukkites, and Kushites. Shishak&#x27;s armies captured all of the fortified towns leading to Jerusalem between Gezer and Gibeon. When they laid siege to Jerusalem, Rehoboam gave Shishak all of the treasures out of the temple as a tribute. The Egyptian campaign cut off trade with south Arabia via Elath and the Negev that had been established during Solomon&#x27;s reign. Judah became a vassal state of Egypt.

This invasion is confirmed by records from the Bubastite Portal in Karnak and another archaeological find. Shishak is generally identified with the Egyptian pharaoh Shoshenq I, who invaded Judah. One of the most difficult issues in identifying Shishak with Shoshenq I is the biblical statement that &quot;King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem. He seized the treasures of the Lord&#x27;s temple and the royal palace&quot;, whereas the Bubastite Portal lists do not include Jerusalem or any city from central Judea among the surviving names in the list of Shoshenq&#x27;s conquests.

=== Succession ===
Rehoboam had 18 wives and 60 concubines. They bore him 28 sons and 60 daughters. His wives included Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David, and Abihail, the daughter of Eliab the son of Jesse. His sons with Mahalath were Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. After Mahalath he married his cousin Maacah, daughter (or grand-daughter) of Absalom, David&#x27;s son. His sons with Maacah were Abijam, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. The names of his other wives, sons and all his daughters are not given.

Rehoboam reigned for 17 years. When he died, he was buried beside his ancestors in Jerusalem. He was succeeded by his son Abijah.

== Historicity ==

Extrabiblical evidence for a stable monarchy in Judah during Rehoboam’s reign is scarce, with minimal interest from Shoshenq I and little indication of significant political or economic activity in the region. The similar names of Jeroboam and Rehoboam, along with historical inconsistencies and narrative elements, suggest that their biblical portrayal may be a constructed retrojection.

== Rabbinic literature ==
It was difficult to maintain the Messianic claims of the house of David due to that Rehoboam, the son of King Solomon, was born of an Ammonite woman (I Kings, xiv. 21–31); but it was adduced as an illustration of divine Providence which selected the &quot;two doves,&quot; Ruth, the Moabite, and Naamah, the Ammonitess, for honourable distinction (B. Ḳ. 38b). Naamah An Ammonitess; was one of Solomon&#x27;s wives and mother of Rehoboam (I Kings xiv. 21, 31; II Chron. xii. 13). In the second Greek account (I Kings xii. 24), Naamah is said to have been the daughter of Hanun (Ἄνα), son of Nahash, a king of Ammon (II Sam. x. 1–4). Naamah is praised, in B. Ḳ. 38b, for her righteousness, on account of which Moses had previously been warned by God not to make war upon the Ammonites (comp. Deut. ii. 19), as Naamah was to descend from them.

Rehoboam was the son of an Ammonite woman; and when David praised God because it was permissible to marry Ammonites and Moabites, he held the child upon his knees, giving thanks for himself as well as for Rehoboam, since this permission was of advantage to them both (Yeb. 77a). Rehoboam was stricken with a running sore as a punishment for the curse which David had invoked upon Joab (II Sam. iii. 29) when he prayed that Joab&#x27;s house might forever be afflicted with leprosy and running sores (Sanh. 48b). All the treasures which Israel had brought from Egypt were kept until the Egyptian king Shishak (I Kings xiv. 25, 26) took them from Rehoboam (Pes. 119a).

== In popular culture ==
Rehoboam is portrayed by Gino Leurini in &quot;The Queen of Sheba&quot; (1952) and by Dexter Fletcher in &quot;Solomon&quot; (1997).

In Season 3 of the HBO show Westworld, the artificial intelligence entity dictating the fate of humans through algorithmic analysis is named “Rehoboam”. It is the successor to a prior version called “Solomon” (which was the successor to “David”.) Like the historical Rehoboam, this AI version coincided with the demise of the rule of its line.

In the third episode of season 7 of The Simpsons, titled &quot;Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily&quot;, where the Flanders&#x27; adopt the Simpson children, and perform emergency baptisms after learning the children are unbaptized, Ned Flanders quizzes the Simpson children on their Bible knowledge, during which he references the “Serpent of Rehoboam”.

<text>In telecommunications, RS-232 or Recommended Standard 232 is a standard originally introduced in 1960 for serial communication transmission of data. It formally defines signals connecting between a &quot;DTE&quot; (&quot;data terminal equipment&quot;) such as a computer terminal or PC, and a &quot;DCE&quot; (&quot;data circuit-terminating equipment&quot; or &quot;data communication equipment&quot;), such as a modem. The standard defines the electrical characteristics and timing of signals, the meaning of signals, and the physical size and pinout of connectors. The current version of the standard is &quot;TIA-232-F Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange&quot;, issued in 1997. 

The RS-232 standard had been commonly used with serial ports and serial cables. It is still widely used in industrial communication devices.

A serial port complying with the RS-232 standard was once a standard feature of many types of computers. Personal computers used them for connections not only to modems, but also to printers, computer mice, data storage, uninterruptible power supplies, and other peripheral devices.

Compared with later interfaces such as RS-422, RS-485 and Ethernet, RS-232 has lower transmission speed, shorter maximum cable length, larger voltage swing, larger standard connectors, no multipoint capability and limited multidrop capability. In modern personal computers, USB has displaced RS-232 from most of its peripheral interface roles. Thanks to their simplicity and past ubiquity, however, RS-232 interfaces are still used—particularly in industrial CNC machines, networking equipment and scientific instruments where a short-range, point-to-point, low-speed wired data connection is fully adequate.

==Scope of the standard==
The Electronic Industries Association (EIA) standard RS-232-C as of 1969 defines:
*Electrical signal characteristics such as logic levels, baud rate, timing, and slew rate of signals, voltage withstand level, short-circuit behavior, and maximum load capacitance.
*Interface mechanical characteristics, pluggable connectors and pin identification.
*Functions of each circuit in the interface connector.
*Standard subsets of interface circuits for selected telecom applications.

The standard does not define such elements as the character encoding (i.e. ASCII, EBCDIC, or others), the framing of characters (start or stop bits, etc.), transmission order of bits, or error detection protocols. The character format and transmission bit rate are set by the serial port hardware, typically a UART, which may also contain circuits to convert the internal logic levels to RS-232 compatible signal levels. The standard does not define bit rates for transmission, except that it says it is intended for bit rates lower than 20,000 bits per second.

==History==
RS-232 was first introduced in 1960 by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) as a &quot;Recommended Standard&quot;. The original DTEs were electromechanical teletypewriters, and the original DCEs were (usually) modems. When electronic terminals (smart and dumb) began to be used, they were often designed to be interchangeable with teletypewriters, and so supported RS-232.

Because the standard did not foresee the requirements of devices such as computers, printers, test instruments, POS terminals, and so on, designers implementing an RS-232 compatible interface on their equipment often interpreted the standard idiosyncratically. The resulting common problems were non-standard pin assignment of circuits on connectors, and incorrect or missing control signals. The lack of adherence to the standards produced a thriving industry of breakout boxes, patch boxes, test equipment, books, and other aids for the connection of disparate equipment. A common deviation from the standard was to drive the signals at a reduced voltage. Some manufacturers therefore built transmitters that supplied +5 V and −5 V and labeled them as &quot;RS-232 compatible&quot;.

Later personal computers (and other devices) started to make use of the standard so that they could connect to existing equipment. For many years, an RS-232-compatible port was a standard feature for serial communications, such as modem connections, on many computers (with the computer acting as the DTE). It remained in widespread use into the late 1990s. In personal computer peripherals, it has largely been supplanted by other interface standards, such as USB. RS-232 is still used to connect older designs of peripherals, industrial equipment (such as PLCs), console ports, and special purpose equipment.

The standard has been renamed several times during its history as the sponsoring organization changed its name, and has been variously known as EIA RS-232, EIA 232, and, most recently as TIA 232. The standard continued to be revised and updated by the Electronic Industries Association and since 1988 by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA). Revision C was issued in a document dated August 1969. Revision D was issued in 1986. The current revision is &quot;TIA-232-F Interface Between Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment Employing Serial Binary Data Interchange&quot;, issued in 1997. Changes since Revision C have been in timing and details intended to improve harmonization with the CCITT standard , but equipment built to the current standard will interoperate with older versions.

Related ITU-T standards include V.24 (circuit identification) and (signal voltage and timing characteristics).

In revision D of EIA-232, the D-subminiature connector was formally included as part of the standard (it was only referenced in the appendix of RS-232-C). The voltage range was extended to ±25 volts, and the circuit capacitance limit was expressly stated as 2500 pF. Revision E of EIA-232 introduced a new, smaller, standard D-shell 26-pin &quot;Alt A&quot; connector, and made other changes to improve compatibility with CCITT standards V.24, V.28 and ISO 2110.

==Limitations of the standard==
Because RS-232 is used beyond the original purpose of interconnecting a terminal with a modem, successor standards have been developed to address the limitations. Issues with the RS-232 standard include:
* The large voltage swings and requirement for positive and negative supplies increases power consumption of the interface and complicates power supply design. The voltage swing requirement also limits the upper speed of a compatible interface.
* Single-ended signaling referred to a common signal ground limits the noise immunity and transmission distance.
* Multi-drop connection among more than two devices is not defined. While multi-drop &quot;work-arounds&quot; have been devised, they have limitations in speed and compatibility.
* The standard does not address the possibility of connecting a DTE directly to a DTE, or a DCE to a DCE. Null modem cables can be used to achieve these connections, but these are not defined by the standard, and some such cables use different connections than others.
* The definitions of the two ends of the link are asymmetric. This makes the assignment of the role of a newly developed device problematic; the designer must decide on either a DTE-like or DCE-like interface and which connector pin assignments to use.
* The handshaking and control lines of the interface are intended for the setup and teardown of a dial-up communication circuit; in particular, the use of handshake lines for flow control is not reliably implemented in many devices.
* No method is specified for sending power to a device. While a small amount of current can be extracted from the DTR and RTS lines, this is only suitable for low-power devices such as mice.
* The DB-25 connector recommended in the standard is large compared to current practice.

==Role in modern personal computers==

In the book &quot;PC 97 Hardware Design Guide&quot;, Microsoft deprecated support for the RS-232 compatible serial port of the original IBM PC design. Today, RS-232 has mostly been replaced in personal computers by USB for local communications. Advantages compared to RS-232 are that USB is faster, uses lower voltages, and has connectors that are simpler to connect and use. Disadvantages of USB compared to RS-232 are that USB is far less immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI) and that maximum cable length defined by standards is much shorter (15 meters for RS-232 versus 3–5 meters for USB, depending on the USB version and use of active cables). RS-232 cable lengths of 2000 meters are possible with appropriate line drivers.

In fields such as laboratory automation or surveying, RS-232 devices continue to be used. Some types of programmable logic controllers, variable-frequency drives, servo drives, and computerized numerical control equipment are programmable via RS-232. Computer manufacturers have responded to this demand by re-introducing the DE-9M connector on their computers or by making adapters available.

RS-232 ports are also commonly used to communicate to headless systems such as servers, where no monitor or keyboard is installed, during boot when an operating system is not yet running and therefore no network connection is possible. A computer with an RS-232 serial port can communicate with the serial port of an embedded system (such as a router) as an alternative to monitoring over Ethernet.

==Physical interface==
In RS-232, user data is sent as a time-series of bits. Both synchronous and asynchronous transmissions are supported by the standard. In addition to the data circuits, the standard defines a number of control circuits used to manage the connection between the DTE and DCE. Each data or control circuit only operates in one direction, that is, signaling from a DTE to the attached DCE or the reverse. Because transmit data and receive data are separate circuits, the interface can operate in a full duplex manner, supporting concurrent data flow in both directions. The standard does not define character framing within the data stream or character encoding.

===Voltage levels===

The RS-232 standard defines the voltage levels that correspond to logical one and logical zero levels for the data transmission and the control signal lines. Valid signals are either in the range of +3 to +15 volts or the range −3 to −15 volts with respect to the &quot;Common Ground&quot; (GND) pin; consequently, the range between −3 and +3 volts is not a valid RS-232 level. For data transmission lines (TxD, RxD, and their secondary channel equivalents), logic one is represented as a negative voltage and the signal condition is called &quot;mark&quot;. Logic zero is signaled with a positive voltage and the signal condition is termed &quot;space&quot;. Control signals have the opposite polarity: the asserted or active state is positive voltage and the de-asserted or inactive state is negative voltage. Examples of control lines include request to send (RTS), clear to send (CTS), data terminal ready (DTR), and data set ready (DSR).

The standard specifies a maximum open-circuit voltage of 25 volts: signal levels of ±5 V, ±10 V, ±12 V, and ±15 V are all commonly seen depending on the voltages available to the line driver circuit. Many RS-232 driver chips have inbuilt charge pump circuitry to produce the required voltages from a 3 or 5 volt supply. RS-232 drivers and receivers must be able to withstand indefinite short circuits to the ground or to any voltage level up to ±25 volts. The slew rate, or how fast the signal changes between levels, is also controlled.

Because the voltage levels are higher than logic levels typically used by integrated circuits, special intervening driver circuits are required to translate logic levels. These also protect the device&#x27;s internal circuitry from short circuits or transients that may appear on the RS-232 interface, and provide sufficient current to comply with the slew rate requirements for data transmission.

Because both ends of the RS-232 circuit depend on the ground pin being zero volts, problems will occur when connecting machinery and computers where the voltage between the ground pin on one end, and the ground pin on the other is not zero. This may also cause a hazardous ground loop. Use of a common ground limits RS-232 to applications with relatively short cables. If the two devices are far enough apart or on separate power systems, the local ground connections at either end of the cable will have differing voltages; this difference will reduce the noise margin of the signals. Balanced, differential serial connections such as RS-422 or RS-485 can tolerate larger ground voltage differences because of the differential signaling.

Unused interface signals terminated to the ground will have an undefined logic state. Where it is necessary to permanently set a control signal to a defined state, it must be connected to a voltage source that asserts the logic 1 or logic 0 levels, for example with a pull-up resistor. Some devices provide test voltages on their interface connectors for this purpose.

===Connectors===

RS-232 devices may be classified as Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) or Data Circuit-terminating Equipment (DCE); this defines at each device which wires will be sending and receiving each signal. According to the standard, male connectors have DTE pin functions, and female connectors have DCE pin functions. Other devices may have any combination of connector gender and pin definitions. Many terminals were manufactured with female connectors but were sold with a cable with male connectors at each end; the terminal with its cable satisfied the recommendations in the standard.

The standard recommends the D-subminiature 25-pin connector up to revision C, and makes it mandatory as of revision D. Most devices only implement a few of the twenty signals specified in the standard, so connectors and cables with fewer pins are sufficient for most connections, more compact, and less expensive. Personal computer manufacturers replaced the DB-25M connector with the smaller DE-9M connector. This connector, with a different pinout (see Serial port pinouts), is prevalent for personal computers and associated devices.

Presence of a 25-pin D-sub connector does not necessarily indicate an RS-232-C compliant interface. For example, on the original IBM PC, a male D-sub was an RS-232-C DTE port (with a non-standard current loop interface on reserved pins), but the female D-sub connector on the same PC model was used for the parallel &quot;Centronics&quot; printer port. Some personal computers put non-standard voltages or signals on some pins of their serial ports.

===Cables===
The standard does not define a maximum cable length, but instead defines the maximum capacitance that a compliant drive circuit must tolerate. A widely used rule of thumb indicates that cables more than long will have too much capacitance, unless special cables are used. By using low-capacitance cables, communication can be maintained over larger distances up to about . For longer distances, other signal standards, such as RS-422, are better suited for higher speeds.

Since the standard definitions are not always correctly applied, it is often necessary to consult documentation, test connections with a breakout box, or use trial and error to find a cable that works when interconnecting two devices. Connecting a fully standard-compliant DCE device and DTE device would use a cable that connects identical pin numbers in each connector (a so-called &quot;straight cable&quot;). &quot;Gender changers&quot; are available to solve gender mismatches between cables and connectors. Connecting devices with different types of connectors requires a cable that connects the corresponding pins according to the table below. Cables with 9 pins on one end and 25 on the other are common. Manufacturers of equipment with 8P8C connectors usually provide a cable with either a DB-25 or DE-9 connector (or sometimes interchangeable connectors so they can work with multiple devices). Poor-quality cables can cause false signals by crosstalk between data and control lines (such as Ring Indicator).

If a given cable will not allow a data connection, especially if a gender changer is in use, a null modem cable may be necessary. Gender changers and null modem cables are not mentioned in the standard, so there is no officially sanctioned design for them.

==Data and control signals==

The following table lists commonly used RS-232 signals (called &quot;circuits&quot; in the specifications) and their pin assignments on the recommended DB-25 connectors (see Serial port pinouts for other commonly used connectors not defined by the standard).
The signals are named from the standpoint of the DTE. The ground pin is a common return for the other connections, and establishes the &quot;zero&quot; voltage to which voltages on the other pins are referenced. The DB-25 connector includes a second &quot;protective ground&quot; on pin 1; this is connected internally to equipment frame ground, and should not be connected in the cable or connector to signal ground.

===Ring Indicator===

&quot;Ring Indicator&quot; (RI) is a signal sent from the DCE to the DTE device. It indicates to the terminal device that the phone line is ringing. In many computer serial ports, a hardware interrupt is generated when the RI signal changes state. Having support for this hardware interrupt means that a program or operating system can be informed of a change in state of the RI pin, without requiring the software to constantly &quot;poll&quot; the state of the pin. RI does not correspond to another signal that carries similar information the opposite way.

On an external modem the status of the Ring Indicator pin is often coupled to the &quot;AA&quot; (auto answer) light, which flashes if the RI signal has detected a ring. The asserted RI signal follows the ringing pattern closely, which can permit software to detect distinctive ring patterns.

The Ring Indicator signal is used by some older uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs) to signal a power failure state to the computer.

Certain personal computers can be configured for wake-on-ring, allowing a computer that is suspended to answer a phone call.

===RTS, CTS, and RTR===
The Request to Send (RTS) and Clear to Send (CTS) signals were originally defined for use with half-duplex (one direction at a time) modems such as the Bell 202. These modems disable their transmitters when not required and must transmit a synchronization preamble to the receiver when they are re-enabled. The DTE asserts RTS to indicate a desire to transmit to the DCE, and in response the DCE asserts CTS to grant permission, once synchronization with the DCE at the far end is achieved. Such modems are no longer in common use. There is no corresponding signal that the DTE could use to temporarily halt incoming data from the DCE. Thus RS-232&#x27;s use of the RTS and CTS signals, per the older versions of the standard, is asymmetric.

This scheme is also employed in present-day RS-232 to RS-485 converters. RS-485 is a multiple-access bus on which only one device can transmit at a time, a concept that is not provided for in RS-232. The RS-232 device asserts RTS to tell the converter to take control of the RS-485 bus so that the converter, and thus the RS-232 device, can send data onto the bus.

Modern communications environments use full-duplex (both directions simultaneously) modems. In that environment, DTEs have no reason to deassert RTS. However, due to the possibility of changing line quality, delays in processing of data, etc., there is a need for symmetric, bidirectional flow control.

A symmetric alternative providing flow control in both directions was developed and marketed in the late 1980s by various equipment manufacturers. It redefined the RTS signal to mean that the DTE is ready to receive data from the DCE. This scheme was eventually codified in version RS-232-E (actually TIA-232-E by that time) by defining a new signal, &quot;RTR (Ready to Receive)&quot;, which is CCITT V.24 circuit 133. TIA-232-E and the corresponding international standards were updated to show that circuit 133, when implemented, shares the same pin as RTS (Request to Send), and that when 133 is in use, RTS is assumed by the DCE to be asserted at all times.

In this scheme, commonly called &quot;RTS/CTS flow control&quot; or &quot;RTS/CTS handshaking&quot; (though the technically correct name would be &quot;RTR/CTS&quot;), the DTE asserts RTS whenever it is ready to receive data from the DCE, and the DCE asserts CTS whenever it is ready to receive data from the DTE. Unlike the original use of RTS and CTS with half-duplex modems, these two signals operate independently from one another. This is an example of hardware flow control. However, &quot;hardware flow control&quot; in the description of the options available on an RS-232-equipped device does not always mean RTS/CTS handshaking.

Equipment using this protocol must be prepared to buffer some extra data, since the remote system may have begun transmitting just before the local system de-asserts RTR.

===3-wire and 5-wire RS-232===
A minimal &quot;3-wire&quot; RS-232 connection consisting only of transmit data, receive data, and ground, is commonly used when the full facilities of RS-232 are not required. Even a two-wire connection (data and ground) can be used if the data flow is one way (for example, a digital postal scale that periodically sends a weight reading, or a GPS receiver that periodically sends position, if no configuration via RS-232 is necessary). When only hardware flow control is required in addition to two-way data, the RTS and CTS lines are added in a 5-wire version.

==Seldom-used features==
The EIA-232 standard specifies connections for several features that are not used in most implementations. Their use requires 25-pin connectors and cables.

===Signal rate selection===
The DTE or DCE can specify use of a &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot; signaling rate. The rates, as well as which device will select the rate, must be configured in both the DTE and DCE. The prearranged device selects the high rate by setting the Data Signal Rate Selector (DSRS, pin 23) signal to ON. Sometimes called Data Rate Select (DRS), this signal should not be confused with the more commonly used Data Set Ready (DSR, pin 6).

===Loopback testing===
Many DCE devices have a loopback capability used for testing. When enabled, signals are echoed back to the sender rather than being sent on to the receiver. If supported, the DTE can signal the local DCE (the one it is connected to) to enter loopback mode by setting Local Loop (LL, pin 18) to ON, or the remote DCE (the one the local DCE is connected to) to enter loopback mode by setting Remote Loop (RL, pin 21) to ON. The latter tests the communications link, as well as both DCEs. When the DCE is in test mode, it signals the DTE by setting Test Indicator (TI, pin 25) to ON.

A commonly used version of loopback testing does not involve any special capability of either end. A hardware loopback is simply a wire connecting complementary pins together in the same connector (see &quot;loopback&quot;).

Loopback testing is often performed with a specialized DTE called a bit error rate tester (or BERT).

===Timing signals===
Some synchronous devices provide a clock signal to synchronize data transmission, especially at higher data rates. Two timing signals are provided by the DCE. Pin 15 is the transmitter clock (TCK), or send timing (ST); the DTE puts the next bit on the transmit data line (pin 2) when this clock transitions from OFF to ON (so it is stable during the ON to OFF transition when the DCE registers the bit). Pin 17 is the receiver clock (RCK), or receive timing (RT); the DTE reads the next bit from the receive data line (pin 3) when this clock transitions from ON to OFF.

Alternatively, the DTE can provide a clock signal, called transmitter timing (TT, pin 24) for transmitted data. Data is changed when the clock transitions from OFF to ON, and read during the ON to OFF transition. TT can be used to overcome the problem of propagation delay in a long cable. ST must traverse a cable of unknown length and delay, clock a bit out of the DTE after another unknown delay, and return it to the DCE over the same unknown cable delay. When sending data at high speed, the data bit may not arrive in time for the ON to OFF transition of ST.

Since the relation between the transmitted bit and TT can be fixed in the DTE design, and since both signals traverse the same cable length, using TT eliminates the issue. TT may be generated by looping ST back with an appropriate phase change to align it with the transmitted data. ST loop back to TT lets the DTE use the DCE as the frequency reference, and correct the clock to data timing.

Synchronous clocking is required for such protocols as SDLC, HDLC, and X.25.

===Secondary channel===
A secondary data channel, identical in capability to the primary channel, can optionally be implemented by the DTE and DCE devices. Pin assignments are as follows:
==Related standards==
Other serial signaling standards may not interoperate with standard-compliant RS-232 ports. For example, using the TTL levels of near +5 V and 0 V puts the mark level in the undefined area of the standard. Such levels are sometimes used with GPS receivers and depth finders. A chip such as MAX232 is required to convert the voltage levels.

A 20 mA current loop uses the absence of 20 mA current for high, and the presence of current in the loop for low; this signaling method is often used for long-distance and optically isolated links. Connection of a current-loop device to a compliant RS-232 port requires a level translator. Current-loop devices can supply voltages in excess of the must-withstand voltage limits of a compliant device. The original IBM PC serial port card implemented a 20 mA current-loop interface, which was never emulated by other suppliers of plug-compatible equipment.

Other serial interfaces similar to RS-232:
*RS-422 – a high-speed system similar to RS-232 but with differential signaling
*RS-423 – a high-speed system similar to RS-422 but with unbalanced signaling
*RS-449 – a functional and mechanical interface that used RS-422 and RS-423 signals; never caught on like RS-232 and was withdrawn by the EIA
*RS-485 – a descendant of RS-422 that can be used as a bus in multidrop configurations
*MIL-STD-188 – a system like RS-232 but with better impedance and rise time control. One very significant difference: RS-232 uses a positive voltage to indicate a 0 and a negative voltage to indicate a 1. MIL-STD-188 uses a negative voltage for 0 and a positive voltage for a 1.
*EIA-530 – a high-speed system using RS-422 or RS-423 electrical properties in an EIA-232 pinout configuration, thus combining the best of both; supersedes RS-449
*EIA/TIA-561 – defines RS-232 pinouts for eight-position, eight-contact (8P8C) modular connectors (which may be improperly called RJ45 connectors)
*EIA/TIA-562 – low-voltage version of EIA/TIA-232
*TIA-574 – standardizes the 9-pin D-subminiature connector pinout for use with EIA-232 electrical signalling, as originated on the IBM PC/AT
*EIA/TIA-694 – similar to TIA/EIA-232-F but with support for higher data rates up to 

The International Telecommunication Union publishes standard ITR-R V.24 (formerly CCITT standard V.24), &quot;List of Definitions for Interchange Circuits between Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and Data Circuit-Terminating Equipment (DCE)&quot; with circuit definitions compatible to those in EIA RS 232. V.24 does not specify signal levels or timing. Electrical parameters for signals are specified in ITU-R-V.28.

==Development tools==
When developing or troubleshooting systems using RS-232, close examination of hardware signals can be important to find problems. This can be done using simple devices with LEDs that indicate the logic levels of data and control signals. &quot;Y&quot; cables may be used to allow using another serial port to monitor all traffic on one direction. A serial line analyzer is a device similar to a logic analyzer but specialized for RS-232&#x27;s voltage levels, connectors, and, where used, clock signals; it collects, stores, and displays the data and control signals, allowing developers to view them in detail. Some simply display the signals as waveforms; more elaborate versions include the ability to decode characters in ASCII or other common codes and to interpret common protocols used over RS-232 such as SDLC, HDLC, DDCMP, and X.25. Serial line analyzers are available as standalone units, as software and interface cables for general-purpose logic analyzers and oscilloscopes, and as programs that run on common personal computers and devices.

<doc id="26032" wikidata="Q105674" url="?curid=26032" title="Running">
<text>Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion by which humans and other animals move rapidly on foot. Running is a gait with an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions). This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight, and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion. A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride co-occur, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity. The term &quot;running&quot; can refer to a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.

Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy.

It is hypothesized that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably to hunt animals. Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas. Records of competitive racing date back to the Tailteann Games in Ireland between 632 BCE and 1171 BCE, while the first recorded Olympic Games took place in 776 BCE. Running has been described as the world&#x27;s most accessible sport.
==History==


It is thought that human running evolved at least four and a half million years ago out of the ability of the ape-like Australopithecus, an early ancestor of humans, to walk upright on two legs.

Early humans most likely developed into endurance runners from the practice of persistence hunting of animals, the activity of following and chasing until a prey is too exhausted to flee, succumbing to &quot;chase myopathy&quot; (Sears 2001), and that human features such as the nuchal ligament, abundant sweat glands, the Achilles tendons, big knee joints and muscular glutei maximi, were changes caused by this type of activity (Bramble &amp; Lieberman 2004, et al.). The theory as first proposed used comparative physiological evidence and the natural habits of animals when running, indicating the likelihood of this activity as a successful hunting method. Further evidence from observation of modern-day hunting practices also indicated this likelihood (Carrier et al. 1984).
 According to Sears (p. 12) scientific investigation (Walker &amp; Leakey 1993) of the Nariokotome skeleton provided further evidence for the Carrier theory.

Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas such as Greece, Egypt, Asia, and the East African Rift in Africa. The Tailteann Games, an Irish sporting festival in honor of the goddess Tailtiu, dates back to 1829 BCE and is one of the earliest records of competitive running. The origins of the Olympics and Marathon running are shrouded by myth and legend, though the first recorded games took place in 776 BCE. Running in Ancient Greece can be traced back to these games of 776 BCE.

==Description==
Running gait can be divided into two phases regarding the lower extremity: stance and swing. These can be further divided into absorption, propulsion, initial swing, and terminal swing. Due to the continuous nature of running gait, no certain point is assumed to be the beginning. However, for simplicity, it will be assumed that absorption and footstrike mark the beginning of the running cycle in a body already in motion.

===Footstrike===
Footstrike occurs when a plantar portion of the foot makes initial contact with the ground. Common footstrike types include forefoot, midfoot, and heel strike types. These are characterized by initial contact of the ball of the foot, ball and heel of the foot simultaneously and heel of the foot respectively. During this time, the hip joint is undergoing extension from being in maximal flexion from the previous swing phase. For proper force absorption, the knee joint should be flexed upon the footstrike, and the ankle should be slightly in front of the body. Footstrike begins the absorption phase as forces from initial contact are attenuated throughout the lower extremity. Absorption of forces continues as the body moves from footstrike to midstance due to vertical propulsion from the toe-off during a previous gait cycle.

===Midstance===
Midstance is when the lower extremity limb of focus is in knee flexion directly underneath the trunk, pelvis, and hips. At this point, propulsion begins to occur as the hips undergo hip extension, the knee joint undergoes extension, and the ankle undergoes plantar flexion. Propulsion continues until the leg is extended behind the body and toe-off occurs. This involves a maximal hip extension, knee extension, and plantar flexion for the subject, resulting in the body being pushed forward from this motion, and the ankle/foot leaves the ground as the initial swing begins.

===Propulsion phase===
Research, especially in the footstrike debate, has primarily focused on identifying and preventing injuries during the absorption phases of running. The propulsion phase, which occurs from midstance to toe-off, is crucial for understanding how the body moves forward. 

In a full stride length model, elements of both the terminal swing and footstrike contribute to propulsion. 
The setup for propulsion begins at the end of the terminal swing when the hip joint flexes, allowing the hip extensors to generate force as they accelerate through the maximal range of motion.

As the hip extensors transition from inhibitory to primary muscle movers, the lower extremity moves back towards the ground, aided by the stretch reflex and gravity. The footstrike and absorption phases follow, leading to two possible outcomes.

With a heel strike, this phase may be just a continuation of momentum from the stretch reflex, gravity, and light hip extension, offering little force absorption through the ankle joint. On the other hand, a mid/forefoot strike helps in shock absorption, supporting plantar flexion from midstance to toe-off.

The actual propulsion begins when the lower extremity enters midstance. The hip extensors continue contracting, assisted by gravity and the stretch reflex from maximal hip flexion during the terminal swing. Hip extension pulls the ground underneath the body, propelling the runner forward.

During midstance, the knee should be slightly flexed due to elastic loading from the absorption and footstrike phases, preserving forward momentum. The ankle joint is in dorsiflexion at this point, either elastically loaded from a mid/forefoot strike or preparing for stand-alone concentric plantar flexion.

The final propulsive movements during toe-off involve all three joints: ankle, knee, and hip. The plantar flexors push off from the ground, returning from dorsiflexion in midstance. This can occur either by releasing the elastic load from an earlier mid/forefoot strike or through concentric contraction from a heel strike.

With a forefoot strike, the ankle and knee joints release their stored elastic energy from the footstrike/absorption phase. The quadriceps group/knee extensors fully extend the knee, pushing the body off the ground. Simultaneously, the knee flexors and stretch reflex pull the knee back into flexion, initiating the initial swing phase. The hip extensors extend to the maximum, contributing to forces pulling and pushing off the ground, as well as initiating knee flexion and the initial swing phase.

===Swing phase===
Initial swing is the response of both stretch reflexes and concentric movements to the propulsion movements of the body. Hip flexion and knee flexion occur, beginning the return of the limb to the starting position and setting up for another foot strike. The initial swing ends at midswing when the limb is again directly underneath the trunk, pelvis, and hip with the knee joint flexed and hip flexion continuing. Terminal swing then begins as hip flexion continues to the point of activation of the stretch reflex of the hip extensors. The knee begins to extend slightly as it swings to the anterior portion of the body. The foot then makes contact with the ground with a foot strike, completing the running cycle of one side of the lower extremity.
Each limb of the lower extremity works opposite to the other. When one side is in toe-off/propulsion, the other hand is in the swing/recovery phase preparing for footstrike. Following toe-off and the beginning of the initial swing of one side, there is a flight phase where neither extremity is in contact with the ground due to the opposite side finishing terminal swing. As the footstrike of the one hand occurs, the initial swing continues. The opposing limbs meet with one in midstance and midswing, beginning the propulsion and terminal swing phases.

===Upper extremity function===

The upper extremity function serves mainly in providing balance in conjunction with the opposing side of the lower extremity. The movement of each leg is paired with the opposite arm, which serves to counterbalance the body, particularly during the stance phase. The arms move most effectively (as seen in elite athletes) with the elbow joint at approximately 90 degrees or less, the hands swinging from the hips up to mid-chest level with the opposite leg, the Humerus moving from being parallel with the trunk to approximately 45 degrees shoulder extension (never passing the trunk in flexion) and with as little movement in the transverse plane as possible. The trunk also rotates in conjunction with arm swing. It mainly serves as a balance point from which the limbs are anchored. Thus trunk motion should remain mostly stable with little motion except for slight rotation, as excessive movement would contribute to transverse motion and wasted energy.

===Footstrike debate===
Recent research into various forms of running has focused on the differences in the potential injury risks and shock absorption capabilities between heel and mid/forefoot footstrikes. It has been shown that heel striking is generally associated with higher rates of injury and impact due to inefficient shock absorption and inefficient biomechanical compensations for these forces. This is due to pressures from a heel strike traveling through bones for shock absorption rather than being absorbed by muscles. Since bones cannot disperse forces easily, the forces are transmitted to other parts of the body, including ligaments, joints, and bones in the rest of the lower extremities up to the lower back. This causes the body to use abnormal compensatory motions in an attempt to avoid serious bone injuries. These compensations include internal rotation of the tibia, knee, and hip joints. Excessive compensation over time has been linked to a higher risk of injuries in those joints and the muscles involved in those motions. Conversely, a mid/forefoot strike has been associated with greater efficiency and lower injury risk due to the triceps surae being used as a lever system to absorb forces with the muscles eccentrically rather than through the bone. Landing with a mid/forefoot strike has also been shown to properly attenuate shock and allow the triceps surae to aid in propulsion via reflexive plantarflexion after stretching to absorb ground contact forces. Thus a mid/forefoot strike may aid in propulsion.
However, even among elite athletes, there are variations in self-selected footstrike types. This is especially true in longer distance events, where there is a prevalence of heel strikers. There does tend however to be a greater percentage of mid/forefoot striking runners in the elite fields, particularly in the faster racers and the winning individuals or groups. While one could attribute the faster speeds of elite runners compared to recreational runners with similar footstrikes to physiological differences, the hip, and joints have been left out of the equation for proper propulsion. This raises the question of how heel-striking elite distance runners can keep up such high paces with a supposedly inefficient and injurious foot strike technique.

===Stride length, hip and knee function===
Biomechanical factors associated with elite runners include increased hip function, use, and stride length over recreational runners. An increase in running speeds causes increased ground reaction forces, and elite distance runners must compensate for this to maintain their pace over long distances.
These forces are attenuated through increased stride length via increased hip flexion and extension through decreased ground contact time and more energy being used in propulsion. With increased propulsion in the horizontal plane, less impact occurs from the decreased force in the vertical plane. Increased hip flexion allows for increased use of the hip extensors through midstance and toe-off, allowing for more force production.
The difference even between world-class and national-level 1500-m runners has been associated with more efficient hip joint function. The increase in velocity likely comes from the increased range of motion in hip flexion and extension, allowing for greater acceleration and speed. The hip extensors and extension have been linked to more powerful knee extension during toe-off, contributing to propulsion.
Stride length must be appropriately increased with some degree of knee flexion maintained through the terminal swing phases, as excessive knee extension during this phase along with footstrike has been associated with higher impact forces due to braking and an increased prevalence of heel striking. Elite runners tend to exhibit some degree of knee flexion at footstrike and midstance, which first serves to eccentrically absorb impact forces in the quadriceps muscle group. Secondly it allows for the knee joint to contract concentrically and provides significant aid in propulsion during toe-off as the quadriceps group is capable of producing large amounts of force.
Recreational runners have been shown to increase stride length through increased knee extension rather than increased hip flexion, as exhibited by elite runners, which provides an intense braking motion with each step and decreases the rate and efficiency of knee extension during toe-off, slowing down speed. Knee extension, however, contributes to additional stride length and propulsion during toe-off and is seen more frequently in elite runners as well.

==Good technique==

===Upright posture and slight forward lean===
Leaning forward places a runner&#x27;s center of mass on the front part of the foot, which avoids landing on the heel and facilitates the use of the spring mechanism of the foot. Additionally, it facilitates avoiding the braking effect that occurs when a runner lands their foot in front of the center of mass. Although maintaining an upright posture is crucial, runners should also keep their frame relaxed and engage their core to keep their posture stable. This helps prevent injury as long as the body is neither rigid nor tense. The most common running mistakes are tilting the chin up and scrunching shoulders.

===Stride rate and types===
Exercise physiologists have found that the stride rates are extremely consistent across professional runners, between 185 and 200 steps per minute. The main difference between long- and short-distance runners is the length of stride rather than the rate of stride.

During running, the speed at which the runner moves may be calculated by multiplying the cadence (steps per minute) by the stride length. Running is often measured in terms of pace, expressed in units of minutes per mile or minutes per kilometer (the inverse of speed, in mph or km/h).
Some coaches advocate training at a combination of specific paces related to one&#x27;s fitness to stimulate various physiological improvements.

Different types of stride are necessary for different types of running. When sprinting, runners stay on their toes bringing their legs up, using shorter and faster strides. Long-distance runners tend to have more relaxed strides that vary.

==Health benefits==

=== Cardiovascular ===
While there exists the potential for injury while running (just as there is in any sport), there are many benefits. Some of these benefits include potential weight loss, improved cardiovascular and respiratory health (reducing the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases), improved cardiovascular fitness, reduced total blood cholesterol, strengthening of bones (and potentially increased bone density), possible strengthening of the immune system and an improved self-esteem and emotional state. Running, like all forms of regular exercise, can effectively slow or reverse the effects of aging. Even people who have already experienced a heart attack are 20% less likely to develop serious heart problems if more engaged in running or any type of aerobic activity.

Although an optimal amount of vigorous aerobic exercise such as running might bring benefits related to lower cardiovascular disease and life extension, an excessive dose (e.g., marathons) might have an opposite effect associated with cardiotoxicity.

=== Metabolic ===

Running can assist people in losing weight, staying in shape and improving body composition. Research suggests that the person of average weight will burn approximately 100 calories per mile run. Running increases one&#x27;s metabolism, even after running; one will continue to burn an increased level of calories for a short time after the run. Different speeds and distances are appropriate for different individual health and fitness levels. For new runners, it takes time to get into shape. The key is consistency and a slow increase in speed and distance. While running, it is best to pay attention to how one&#x27;s body feels. If a runner is gasping for breath or feels exhausted while running, it may be beneficial to slow down or try a shorter distance for a few weeks. If a runner feels that the pace or distance is no longer challenging, then the runner may want to speed up or run farther.

=== Mental ===
Running can also have psychological benefits, as many participants in the sport report feeling an elated, euphoric state, often referred to as a &quot;runner&#x27;s high&quot;. Running is frequently recommended as therapy for people with clinical depression and people coping with addiction. A possible benefit may be the enjoyment of nature and scenery, which also improves psychological well-being (see Ecopsychology § Practical benefits).

In animal models, running has been shown to increase the number of newly created neurons within the brain. This finding could have significant implications in aging as well as learning and memory. A recent study published in &quot;Cell Metabolism&quot; has also linked running with improved memory and learning skills.

Running is a great technique to lower inflammation, stress, anxiety, and depression. People with seasonal affective disorder benefit from running outside in warm, sunny weather. Running can improve mental alertness and sleep. Both research and clinical experience have shown that exercise can be a treatment for serious depression and anxiety even some physicians prescribe exercise to most of their patients. Running can have a longer-lasting effect than anti-depressants. The non-threatening environment offered by running generates a sense of achievement and belonging which helps with mental illness.

==Injuries==
=== High impact ===

Many injuries are associated with running because of its high-impact nature. Change in running volume may lead to development of patellofemoral pain syndrome, iliotibial band syndrome, patellar tendinopathy, plica syndrome, and medial tibial stress syndrome. Change in running pace may cause Achilles tendinitis, gastrocnemius injuries, and plantar fasciitis. Repetitive stress on the same tissues without enough time for recovery or running with improper form can lead to many of the above. Runners generally attempt to minimize these injuries by warming up before exercise, focusing on proper running form, performing strength training exercises, eating a well balanced diet, allowing time for recovery, and &quot;icing&quot; (applying ice to sore muscles or taking an ice bath).

Some runners may experience injuries when running on concrete surfaces. The problem with running on concrete is that the body adjusts to this flat surface running, and some of the muscles will become weaker, along with the added impact of running on a harder surface. Therefore, it can be beneficial to change terrain occasionally – such as trail, beach, or grass running. This is more unstable ground and allows the legs to strengthen different muscles. Runners should be wary of twisting their ankles on such terrain. Running downhill also increases knee stress and should, therefore, be avoided. Reducing the frequency and duration can also prevent injury.

Barefoot running has been promoted as a means of reducing running related injuries, but this remains controversial and a majority of professionals advocate the wearing of appropriate shoes as the best method for avoiding injury. However, a study in 2013 concluded that wearing neutral shoes is not associated with increased injuries.

=== Chafing ===

Another common, running-related injury is chafing, caused by repetitive rubbing of one piece of skin against another, or against an article of clothing. One common location for chafe to occur is the runner&#x27;s upper thighs. The skin feels coarse and develops a rash-like look. A variety of deodorants and special anti-chafing creams are available to treat such problems. Chafe is also likely to occur on the nipple. There are a variety of home remedies that runners use to deal with chafing while running such as band-aids and using grease to reduce friction. Prevention is key which is why form fitting clothes are important.

=== Iliotibial band syndrome ===
An iliotibial band is a muscle and tendon that is attached to the hip and runs the length of the thigh to attach to the upper part of the tibia, and the band is what helps the knee to bend. This is an injury that is located at the knee and shows symptoms of swelling outside the knee. Iliotibial band syndrome is also known as &quot;runner&#x27;s knee&quot; or &quot;jogger&#x27;s knee&quot; because it can be caused by jogging or running. Once pain or swelling is noticeable it is important to put ice on it immediately and it is recommended to rest the knee for better healing. Most knee injuries can be treated by light activity and much rest for the knee. In more serious cases, arthroscopy is the most common to help repair ligaments but severe situations reconstructive surgery would be needed. A survey was taken in 2011 with knee injuries being 22.7% of the most common injuries.

=== Medial tibial stress syndrome ===
A more known injury is medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS) which is the accurate name for shin splints. This is caused during running when the muscle is being overused along the front of the lower leg with symptoms that affect 2 to 6 inches of the muscle. Shin splints have sharp, splinter-like pain, that is typically X-rayed by doctors but is not necessary for shin splints to be diagnosed. To help prevent shin splints it is commonly known to stretch before and after a workout session, and also avoid heavy equipment especially during the first couple of workout sessions. Also to help prevent shin splints do not increase the intensity of a workout more than 10% a week. To treat shin splints it is important to rest with the least amount of impact on your legs and apply ice to the area. A survey showed that shin splints make up 12.7% of the most common injuries in running, with blisters being the top percentage at 30.9%.

==Events==

Running is both a competition and a type of training for sports that have running or endurance components. As a sport, it is split into events divided by distance and sometimes includes permutations such as the obstacles in steeplechase and hurdles. Running races are contests to determine which of the competitors is able to run a certain distance in the shortest time. Today, competitive running events make up the core of the sport of athletics. Events are usually grouped into several classes, each requiring substantially different athletic strengths and involving different tactics, training methods, and types of competitors.

Running competitions have probably existed for most of humanity&#x27;s history and were a key part of the ancient Olympic Games as well as the modern Olympics. The activity of running went through a period of widespread popularity in the United States during the running boom of the 1970s. Over the next two decades, as many as 25 million Americans were doing some form of running or jogging – accounting for roughly one tenth of the population. Today, road racing is a popular sport among non-professional athletes, who included over 7.7 million people in America alone in 2002.

===Limits of speed===

Footspeed, or sprint speed, is the maximum speed at which a human can run. It is affected by many factors, varies greatly throughout the population, and is important in athletics and many sports. Air resistance for top sprinters can take up to 5% of their energy. 

The fastest human footspeed on record is , seen during a 100-meter sprint (average speed between the 60th and the 80th meter) by Usain Bolt.

=== Speed over increasing distance based on world record times ===
(see :Category:Athletics (track and field) record progressions)

===Types===
;Track
Track running events are individual or relay events with athletes racing over specified distances on an oval running track. The events are categorized as sprints, middle and long-distance, and hurdling.

;Road

Road running takes place on a measured course over an established road (as opposed to track and cross country running). These events normally range from distances of 5 kilometers to longer distances such as half marathons and marathons, and they may involve scores of runners or wheelchair entrants.

;Cross-country

Cross country running takes place over the open or rough terrain. The courses used for these events may include grass, mud, woodlands, hills, flat ground and water. It is a popular participatory sport and is one of the events which, along with track and field, road running, and racewalking, makes up the umbrella sport of athletics.

;Vertical

The majority of popular races do not incorporate a significant change in elevation as a key component of a course. There are several, disparate variations that feature significant inclines or declines. These fall into two main groups.

The naturalistic group is based on outdoor racing over geographical features. Among these are the cross country-related sports of fell running (a tradition associated with Northern Europe) and trail running (mainly ultramarathon distances), the running/climbing combination of skyrunning (organised by the International Skyrunning Federation with races across North America, Europe and East Asia) and the mainly trail- and road-centred mountain running (governed by the World Mountain Running Association and based mainly in Europe).

The second variety of vertical running is based on human structures, such as stairs and man-made slopes. The foremost type of this is tower running, which sees athletes compete indoors, running up steps within very tall structures such as the Eiffel Tower or Empire State Building.

===Distances===

====Sprints====

Sprints are short running events in athletics and track and field. Races over short distances are among the oldest running competitions. The first 13 editions of the Ancient Olympic Games featured only one event – the stadion race, which was a race from one end of the stadium to the other. There are three sprinting events which are currently held at the Olympics and outdoor World Championships: the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 400 metres. These events have their roots in races of imperial measurements which were later altered to metric: the 100 m evolved from the 100-yard dash, the 200 m distances came from the furlong (or 1/8 of a mile), and the 400 m was the successor to the 440-yard dash or quarter-mile race.

At the professional level, sprinters begin the race by assuming a crouching position in the starting blocks before leaning forward and gradually moving into an upright position as the contest progresses and momentum is gained. Athletes remain in the same lane on the running track throughout all sprinting events, with the sole exception of the 400 m indoors. Races up to 100 m are largely focused upon acceleration to an athlete&#x27;s maximum speed. All sprints beyond this distance increasingly incorporate an element of endurance. Human physiology dictates that a runner&#x27;s near-top speed cannot be maintained for more than thirty seconds or so as lactic acid builds up, and leg muscles begin to be deprived of oxygen.

The 60 metres is a common indoor event and it an indoor world championship event. Other less-common events include the 50 metres, 55 metres, 300 metres and 500 metres which are used in some high and collegiate competitions in the United States. The 150 metres, is rarely competed: Pietro Mennea set a world best in 1983, Olympic champions Michael Johnson and Donovan Bailey went head-to-head over the distance in 1997, and Usain Bolt improved Mennea&#x27;s record in 2009.

====Middle distance====

Middle-distance running events are track races longer than sprints up to 3000 metres. The standard middle distances are the 800 metres, 1500 metres and mile run, although the 3000 metres may also be classified as a middle-distance event. The 880-yard run, or half-mile, was the forebear to the 800 m distance and it has its roots in competitions in the United Kingdom in the 1830s. The 1500 m came about as a result of running three laps of a 500 m track, which was commonplace in continental Europe in the 1900s.

====Long distance====

Examples of longer-distance running events are long-distance track races, half marathons, marathons, ultramarathons, and multiday races.

<text>René François Ghislain Magritte (; 21 November 1898 – 15 August 1967) was a Belgian surrealist artist known for his depictions of familiar objects in unfamiliar, unexpected contexts, which often provoked questions about the nature and boundaries of reality and representation. His imagery has influenced pop art, minimalist art, and conceptual art.

==Early life==
René Magritte was born in Lessines, in the province of Hainaut in Belgium, in 1898. He was the oldest son of Léopold Magritte, a tailor and textile merchant, and Régina (née Bertinchamps), who was a milliner before she got married. Little is known about Magritte&#x27;s early life. He began lessons in drawing in 1910.

On 24 February 1912, his mother died by suicide by drowning herself in the River Sambre at Châtelet. It was not her first suicide attempt. Her body was not discovered until 12 March. According to a legend, 13-year-old Magritte was present when her body was retrieved from the water, but recent research has discredited this story, which may have originated with the family nurse. Supposedly, when his mother was found, her dress was covering her face, an image that has been suggested as the source of several of Magritte&#x27;s paintings in 1927–1928 of people with cloth obscuring their faces, including &quot;Les Amants&quot;.

==Career==
Magritte&#x27;s earliest paintings, which date from about 1915, were Impressionistic in style. During 1916–1918, he studied at the in Brussels, under Constant Montald, but found the instruction uninspiring. He also took classes at the Académie Royale from the painter and poster designer Gisbert Combaz. The paintings he produced during 1918–1924 were influenced by Futurism and by the figurative Cubism of Metzinger.

From December 1920 until September 1921, Magritte served in the Belgian infantry in the Flemish town of Beverlo near Leopoldsburg. In 1922, Magritte married Georgette Berger, whom he had met as a child in 1913. Also during 1922, the poet Marcel Lecomte showed Magritte a reproduction of Giorgio de Chirico&#x27;s &quot;The Song of Love&quot; (painted in 1914). The work brought Magritte to tears; he described this as &quot;one of the most moving moments of my life: my eyes &quot;saw&quot; thought for the first time&quot;. The paintings of the Belgian symbolist painter William Degouve de Nuncques have also been noted as an influence on Magritte, specifically the former&#x27;s painting &quot;The Blind House&quot; (1892) and Magritte&#x27;s variations or series on &quot;The Empire of Lights&quot;.

In 1922–1923, Magritte worked as a draughtsman in a wallpaper factory, and was a poster and advertisement designer until 1926, when a contract with Galerie Le Centaure in Brussels made it possible for him to paint full-time. In 1926, Magritte produced his first surreal painting, &quot;The Lost Jockey&quot; (&quot;Le jockey perdu&quot;), and held his first solo exhibition in Brussels in 1927. The exhibition was poorly reviewed.

Depressed by the failure, he moved to Paris where he became friends with André Breton and became involved in the Surrealist group. An illusionistic, dream-like quality is characteristic of Magritte&#x27;s version of Surrealism. He became a leading member of the movement, and remained in Paris for three years. In 1929, he was put under contract at Goemans Gallery in Paris along with Jean Arp and Yves Tanguy.

On 15 December 1929, Magritte participated in the last publication, No. 12, of &quot;La Révolution surréaliste&quot;, with his essay &quot;Les mots et les images&quot;, where words play with images in sync with his work &quot;The Treachery of Images&quot;.

Galerie Le Centaure closed at the end of 1929, ending Magritte&#x27;s contract income. Having made little impact in Paris, Magritte returned to Brussels in 1930 and resumed working in advertising. He and his brother, Paul, formed an agency which earned him a living wage. In 1932, Magritte joined the Communist Party, which he would periodically leave and rejoin for several years. In 1936 he had his first solo exhibition in the United States at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York, followed by an exposition at the London Gallery in 1938.

Between 1934 and 1937, Magritte drew film posters under the pseudonym &#x27;Emair&#x27; for the German sound film distributor Tobis Klangfilm. The Leuven City Archive preserves seven posters designed by Magritte.

During the early stages of his career, the British surrealist patron Edward James allowed Magritte to stay rent-free in his London home, where Magritte studied architecture and painted. James is featured in two of Magritte&#x27;s works painted in 1937, &quot;Le Principe du Plaisir&quot; (&quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot;) and &quot;La Reproduction Interdite&quot;, a painting also known as &quot;Not to Be Reproduced&quot;.

During the German occupation of Belgium in World War II he remained in Brussels, which led to a break with Breton. He briefly adopted a colorful, painterly style in 1943–44, an interlude known as his &quot;Renoir period&quot;, as a reaction to his feelings of alienation and abandonment that came with living in German-occupied Belgium.

In 1946, renouncing the violence and pessimism of his earlier work, he joined several other Belgian artists in signing the manifesto &quot;Surrealism in Full Sunlight&quot;. During 1947–48, Magritte&#x27;s &quot;Vache period&quot;, he painted in a provocative and crude Fauve style. During this time, Magritte supported himself through the production of fake Picassos, Braques, and de Chiricos—a fraudulent repertoire he was later to expand into the printing of forged banknotes during the lean postwar period. This venture was undertaken alongside his brother Paul and fellow Surrealist and &quot;surrogate son&quot; Marcel Mariën, to whom had fallen the task of selling the forgeries. At the end of 1948, Magritte returned to the style and themes of his pre-war surrealistic art.

In France, Magritte&#x27;s work has been showcased in a number of retrospective exhibitions, most recently at the Centre Georges Pompidou (2016–2017). In the United States his work has been featured in three retrospective exhibitions: at the Museum of Modern Art in 1965, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1992, and again at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2013. An exhibition entitled &quot;The Fifth Season&quot; at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art in 2018 focused on the work of his later years.

Politically, Magritte stood to the left, and retained close ties to the Communist Party, even in the post-war years. However, he was critical of the functionalist cultural policy of the Communist left, stating that &quot;Class consciousness is as necessary as bread; but that does not mean that workers must be condemned to bread and water and that wanting chicken and champagne would be harmful. (...) For the Communist painter, the justification of artistic activity is to create pictures that can represent mental luxury.&quot; While remaining committed to the political left, he thus advocated a certain autonomy of art. Spiritually, Magritte was an agnostic.

Popular interest in Magritte&#x27;s work rose considerably in the 1960s, and his imagery has influenced pop, minimalist, and conceptual art. In 2005 he was 9th in the Walloon version of &quot;De Grootste Belg&quot; (&quot;The Greatest Belgian&quot;); in the Flemish version he was 18th.

==Personal life==
Magritte married Georgette Berger in June 1922. Georgette was the daughter of a butcher in Charleroi, and first met Magritte when she was 13 and he was 15. They met again seven years later in Brussels in 1920 and Georgette, who had also studied art, became Magritte&#x27;s model, muse, and wife.

In 1936, Magritte&#x27;s marriage became troubled when he met a young performance artist, Sheila Legge, and began an affair with her. Magritte arranged for his friend, Paul Colinet, to entertain and distract Georgette, but this led to an affair between Georgette and Colinet. Magritte and his wife did not reconcile until 1940.

Magritte died of pancreatic cancer on 15 August 1967, aged 68, and was interred in Schaerbeek Cemetery, Evere, Brussels.

==Philosophical and artistic gestures==
Magritte&#x27;s work frequently displays a collection of ordinary objects in an unusual context, giving new meanings to familiar things. The use of objects as other than what they seem is typified in his painting, &quot;The Treachery of Images&quot; (&quot;La trahison des images&quot;), which shows a pipe that looks as though it is a model for a tobacco store advertisement. Magritte painted below the pipe &quot;Ceci n&#x27;est pas une pipe&quot; (&quot;This is not a pipe&quot;), which seems a contradiction, but is actually true: the painting is not a pipe, it is an &quot;image&quot; of a pipe. It does not &quot;satisfy emotionally&quot;; when Magritte was once asked about this image, he replied that of course it was not a pipejust try to fill it with tobacco.
Magritte&#x27;s work has been described by Suzi Gablik as &quot;a systematic attempt to disrupt any dogmatic view of the physical world&quot;. Therefore, when Magritte painted rockswhich are commonly understood to be heavy, inanimate objectshe often painted them floating cloud-like in the sky, or painted scenes of people and their environment turned to stone.

Among Magritte&#x27;s works are a number of surrealist versions of other famous paintings, such as &quot;Perspective I&quot; and &quot;Perspective II&quot;, which are copies of David&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Madame Récamier&quot; and Manet&#x27;s &quot;The Balcony&quot;, respectively, but with the human subjects replaced by coffins. Elsewhere, Magritte challenges the difficulty of artwork to convey meaning with a recurring motif of an easel, as in his &quot;The Human Condition&quot; series (1933, 1935) or &quot;The Promenades of Euclid&quot; (1955), wherein the spires of a castle are &quot;painted&quot; upon the ordinary streets which the canvas overlooks. In a letter to André Breton, he wrote of &quot;The Human Condition&quot; that it was irrelevant if the scene behind the easel differed from what was depicted upon it, &quot;but the main thing was to eliminate the difference between a view seen from outside and from inside a room&quot;. The windows in some of these pictures are framed with heavy drapes, suggesting a theatrical motif.

Magritte&#x27;s style of surrealism is more representational than the &quot;automatic&quot; style of artists such as Joan Miró. Magritte&#x27;s use of ordinary objects in unfamiliar spaces is joined to his desire to create poetic imagery. He described the act of painting as &quot;the art of putting colors side by side in such a way that their real aspect is effaced, so that familiar objectsthe sky, people, trees, mountains, furniture, the stars, solid structures, graffitibecome united in a single poetically disciplined image. The poetry of this image dispenses with any symbolic significance, old or new.&quot;

René Magritte described his paintings as &quot;visible images which conceal nothing; they evoke mystery and, indeed, when one sees one of my pictures, one asks oneself this simple question, &#x27;What does that mean?&#x27;. It does not mean anything, because mystery means nothing either, it is unknowable.&quot;

Magritte&#x27;s constant play with reality and illusion has been attributed to the early death of his mother. Psychoanalysts who have examined bereaved children have hypothesized that Magritte&#x27;s back-and-forth play with reality and illusion reflects his &quot;constant shifting back and forth from what he wishes&#x27;mother is alive&#x27;to what he knows&#x27;mother is dead&#x27;&quot;.

More recently, Patricia Allmer has demonstrated the influence of fairground attractions on Magritte&#x27;s artfrom carousels and circuses to panoramas and stage magic.

==Artists influenced by Magritte==
Contemporary artists have been greatly influenced by René Magritte&#x27;s stimulating examination of the fickleness of images. Some artists who have been influenced by Magritte&#x27;s works include John Baldessari, Ed Ruscha, Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, Jan Verdoodt, Martin Kippenberger, Duane Michals, Storm Thorgerson, and Luis Rey. Some of the artists&#x27; works integrate direct references and others offer contemporary viewpoints on his abstract fixations.

Magritte&#x27;s use of simple graphic and everyday imagery has been compared to that of the pop-artists. His influence in the development of pop art has been widely recognized, although Magritte himself discounted the connection. He considered the pop artists&#x27; representation of &quot;the world as it is&quot; as &quot;their error&quot;, and contrasted their attention to the transitory with his concern for &quot;the feeling for the real, insofar as it is permanent.&quot; The 2006–2007 LACMA exhibition &quot;Magritte and Contemporary Art: The Treachery of Images&quot; examined the relationship between Magritte and contemporary art.

==Legacy==
The 1960s brought a great increase in public awareness of Magritte&#x27;s work. Thanks to his &quot;sound knowledge of how to present objects in a manner both suggestive and questioning&quot;, his works have been frequently adapted or plagiarized in advertisements, posters, book covers and the like. Examples include album covers such as &quot;Beck-Ola&quot; by The Jeff Beck Group (reproducing Magritte&#x27;s &quot;The Listening Room&quot;), Alan Hull&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Pipedream&quot; which used &quot;The Philosopher&#x27;s Lamp&quot;, Jackson Browne&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;Late for the Sky&quot;, with artwork inspired by &quot;The Empire of Light&quot;, Oregon&#x27;s album &quot;Oregon&quot; referring to &quot;Carte Blanche&quot;, the Firesign Theatre&#x27;s album &quot;Just Folks... A Firesign Chat&quot; based on &quot;The Mysteries of the Horizon&quot;, and Styx&#x27;s album &quot;The Grand Illusion&quot; incorporating an adaptation of the painting &quot;The Blank Signature (Le Blanc Seing)&quot;. The Nigerian rapper Jesse Jagz&#x27;s 2014 album &quot;Jagz Nation Vol. 2: Royal Niger Company&quot; has cover art inspired by Magritte&#x27;s works. In 2015 the band Punch Brothers used &quot;The Lovers&quot; as the cover of their album &quot;The Phosphorescent Blues&quot;.

The logo of Apple Corps, The Beatles&#x27; company, is inspired by Magritte&#x27;s &quot;Le Jeu de Mourre&quot;, a 1966 painting. Paul Simon&#x27;s song &quot;Rene and Georgette Magritte with Their Dog after the War&quot;, inspired by a photograph of Magritte by Lothar Wolleh, appears on the 1983 album &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot;. John Cale wrote a song titled &quot;Magritte&quot;. The song appears on the 2003 album &quot;HoboSapiens&quot;. Tom Stoppard wrote a 1970 Surrealist play called &quot;After Magritte&quot;. John Berger scripted the book &quot;Ways of Seeing&quot; using images and ideologies regarding Magritte. Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s 1979 book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot; uses Magritte works for many of its illustrations. &quot;The Treachery of Images&quot; was used in a major plot in L. J. Smith&#x27;s 1994 novel &quot;The Forbidden Game&quot;. Magritte&#x27;s imagery has inspired filmmakers ranging from the surrealist Marcel Mariën to mainstream directors such as Jean-Luc Godard, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Bernardo Bertolucci, Nicolas Roeg, John Boorman and Terry Gilliam.

According to the 1998 documentary &quot;The Fear of God: 25 Years of &quot;The Exorcist&quot;&quot;, the iconic poster shot for the film &quot;The Exorcist&quot; was inspired by Magritte&#x27;s &quot;The Empire of Light&quot;.

In the 1992 movie &quot;Toys&quot;, Magritte&#x27;s work was influential in the entire movie but specifically in a break-in scene, featuring Robin Williams and Joan Cusack in a music video hoax. Many of Magritte&#x27;s works were used directly in that scene. In the 1999 movie &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; starring Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo and Denis Leary, the Magritte painting &quot;The Son of Man&quot; was prominently featured as part of the plot line.

Gary Numan&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot; was a reference to Magritte&#x27;s painting of the same name.
In the early 2000s, two LPs were released that had album cover art referencing &quot;The Lovers&quot;: &quot;Casually Dressed &amp; Deep in Conversation&quot; by Funeral for a Friend and &quot;Frances the Mute&quot; by The Mars Volta.

In John Green&#x27;s novel (2012) and movie (2014), &quot;The Fault in Our Stars&quot;, the main character Hazel Grace Lancaster wears a tee shirt with Magritte&#x27;s, &quot;The Treachery of Images&quot;, (This is not a pipe.) Just prior to leaving her mother to visit her favorite author, Hazel explains the drawing to her confused mother and states that the author&#x27;s novel has &quot;several Magritte references&quot;, clearly hoping the author will be pleased with the reference.

The official music video of Markus Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Koolhaus&quot; under his Dakota guise was inspired from Magritte&#x27;s works.

A location in Brussels has been named &quot;Ceci n&#x27;est pas une rue&quot; (This is not a street).

Belgian actor Pierre Gervais is set to play René Magritte in the 2025 television series This Is Not A Murder Mystery.

==Magritte Museum and other collections==
The Magritte Museum opened to the public on 30 May 2009 in Brussels. Housed in the five-level neo-classical Hotel Altenloh, on the Place Royale, it displays some 200 original Magritte paintings, drawings and sculptures including &quot;The Return&quot;, &quot;Scheherazade&quot; and &quot;The Empire of Light&quot;. This multidisciplinary permanent installation is the biggest Magritte archive anywhere and most of the work is directly from the collection of the artist&#x27;s widow, Georgette Magritte, and from Irene Hamoir Scutenaire, who was his primary collector. Additionally, the museum includes Magritte&#x27;s experiments with photography from 1920 on and the short Surrealist films he made from 1956 on.

Another museum is located at 135 Rue Esseghem in Brussels in Magritte&#x27;s former home, where he lived with his wife from 1930 to 1954. &quot;Olympia&quot; (1948), a nude portrait of Magritte&#x27;s wife reportedly worth about US$1.1 million, was stolen from this museum on the morning of 24 September 2009 by two armed men. It was returned to the museum in January 2012, in exchange for a 50,000-Euro payment from the museum&#x27;s insurer. The thieves reportedly agreed to the deal because they were unable to sell the painting on the black market due to its fame.

The Menil Collection in Houston, Texas holds one of the most significant collections of dada and surrealist work in the United States, including dozens of oil paintings, gouaches, drawings, and bronzes by René Magritte. John de Menil and Dominique de Menil initiated and funded the catalogue raisonné of Magritte&#x27;s oeuvre, published between 1992 and 1997 in five volumes, with an addendum in 2012. Major oil paintings in the Menil Collection include: &quot;The Meaning of Night&quot; (1927), &quot;The Eternally Obvious&quot; (1930), &quot;The Rape&quot; (1934), &quot;The Listening Room&quot; (1952), and &quot;Golconda&quot; (1953) which are typically exhibited a few at a time on a rotating basis with other surrealist works in the collection.

<text>Rudolf Christian Karl Diesel (, ; 18 March 1858 – 29 September 1913) was a German inventor and mechanical engineer who invented the Diesel engine, which burns Diesel fuel; both are named after him.

==Early life and education==
Diesel was born at 38 Rue Notre Dame de Nazareth in Paris, France, in 1858 the second of three children of Elise (née Strobel) and Theodor Diesel. His parents were Bavarian immigrants living in Paris. Theodor Diesel, a bookbinder by trade, left his home town of Augsburg, Bavaria, in 1848. He met his wife, a daughter of a Nuremberg merchant, in Paris in 1855 and became a leather goods manufacturer there. 

Shortly after his birth, Diesel was given away to a Vincennes farmer family, where he spent his first nine months. When he was returned to his family, they moved into the flat 49 in the Rue de la Fontaine-au-Roi. At the time, the Diesel family suffered from financial difficulties, thus young Rudolf Diesel had to work in his father&#x27;s workshop and deliver leather goods to customers using a barrow. He attended a Protestant-French school and soon became interested in social questions and technology. Being a very good student, 12-year-old Diesel received the Société pour l&#x27;Instruction Elémentaire bronze medal and had plans to enter Ecole Primaire Supérieure in 1870.

At the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War the same year, his family were deported to England, settling in London, where Diesel attended an English-speaking school. Before the war&#x27;s end, however, Diesel&#x27;s mother sent 12-year-old Rudolf to Augsburg to live with his aunt and uncle, Barbara and Christoph Barnickel, to become fluent in German and to visit the &quot;Königliche Kreis-Gewerbeschule&quot; (Royal County Vocational College), where his uncle taught mathematics. He was enrolled at the &quot;Technische Hochschule&quot; (Technical High School).

At the age of 14, Diesel wrote a letter to his parents saying that he intended to become an engineer. After finishing his basic education at the top of his class in 1873, he enrolled at the newly founded Industrial School of Augsburg. Two years later, he received a merit scholarship from the Royal Bavarian Polytechnic of Munich, which he accepted against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to begin working instead.

==Career==
One of Diesel&#x27;s professors in Munich was Carl von Linde. Diesel was unable to graduate with his class in July 1879 because he fell ill with typhoid fever. While waiting for the next examination date, he gained practical engineering experience at the Sulzer Brothers Machine Works in Winterthur, Switzerland. Diesel graduated in January 1880 with highest academic honours and returned to Paris, where he assisted Linde with the design and construction of a modern refrigeration and ice plant. Diesel became the director of the plant a year afterwards.

In 1883, Diesel married Martha Flasche, and continued to work for Linde, gaining numerous patents in both Germany and France.

In early 1890, Diesel moved to Berlin with his wife and children, Rudolf Jr, Heddy, and Eugen, to assume management of Linde&#x27;s corporate research and development department and to join several other corporate boards. Since he was not allowed to use for his own purposes the patents he developed while an employee of Linde&#x27;s, he expanded beyond the field of refrigeration. He first worked with steam, his research into thermal efficiency and fuel efficiency leading him to build a steam engine using ammonia vapor. During tests, however, the engine exploded and almost killed him. His research into high-compression cylinder pressures tested the strength of iron and steel cylinder heads. One exploded during a test run. He spent many months in a hospital, followed by health and eyesight problems. It was during this year that Diesel began conceptualising the idea of a diesel engine.

Ever since attending lectures of von Linde, Diesel worked on designing an internal combustion engine that could approach the maximum theoretical thermal efficiency of the Carnot cycle. In 1892, after working on this idea for several years, he considered his theory to be completed. In the same year, Diesel was given the German patent DRP 67207. In 1893, he published a treatise entitled &quot;Theory and Construction of a Rational Heat-engine to Replace the Steam Engine and The Combustion Engines Known Today&quot;, that he had been working on since early 1892. This treatise formed the basis for his work on and development of the diesel engine. By summer 1893, Diesel had realised that his initial theory was erroneous, leading him to file another patent application for the corrected theory in 1893.

Diesel understood thermodynamics and the theoretical and practical constraints on fuel efficiency. He knew that as much as 90% of the energy available in the fuel is wasted in a steam engine. His work in engine design was driven by the goal of much higher efficiency ratios. 

As opposed to outside ignition applied against internal air and fuel mixture, air was compressed internally within the cylinder whilst heating, in order for the fuel to establish contact the air immediately before the compression period would end, thus igniting on its own. Therefore, the engine was smaller and weighed less than most contemporary steam engines, not to mention the fact that further fuel sources weren&#x27;t required. Fuel efficiency was measured 75% above the 10% theoretical efficiency for steam engines.

In his engine, fuel was injected at the end of the compression stroke and was ignited by the high temperature resulting from the compression. From 1893 to 1897, Heinrich von Buz, director of Maschinenfabrik Augsburg in Augsburg, provided Rudolf Diesel the opportunity to test and develop his ideas. Diesel also received support from the Krupp firm.

Diesel&#x27;s design utilised compression ignition as opposed to using spark plugs similar to gas engines, with the ability to be run on biodiesel, if not petroleum-originating fuels. Compression engines are circa 30% more efficient over conventional gas burning engines, being mixed through forced compressed air within the combustion chamber, leading to a higher internal temperature, expanding at a higher rate and placing further pressure over the pistons that rotate the crankshaft towards a quicker rate.

Biodiesel often composed of synthesis gas originating from waste cellulose gasification, as well as extraction of lipids from algae, most frequently used by consisting vegetable oils and algae together under methanol transesterification. Numerous firms have developed different techniques in order to achieve such.

The first successful diesel engine Motor 250/400 was officially tested in 1897, featuring a 25 horsepower four-stroke, single vertical cylinder compression. Having just revolutionised the engine manufacturing industry, it became an immediate success, with royalties amassing great wealth for Diesel. The engine is currently on display at the German Technical Museum in Munich.

Besides Germany, Diesel obtained patents for his design in other countries, including the United States.
He was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 1978.

==Disappearance and death==

On the evening of 29 September 1913, Diesel boarded the Great Eastern Railway steamer SS &quot;Dresden&quot; in Antwerp on his way to a meeting of the Consolidated Diesel Manufacturing company in London. He took dinner on board the ship and then retired to his cabin at about 10 p.m., leaving word to be called the next morning at 6:15 a.m., but he was never seen alive again. In the morning his cabin was empty and his bed had not been slept in, although his nightshirt was neatly laid out and his watch had been left where it could be seen from the bed. His hat and neatly folded overcoat were discovered beneath the afterdeck railing.

Shortly after Diesel&#x27;s disappearance, his wife Martha opened a bag that her husband had given to her just before his ill-fated voyage, with directions that it should not be opened until the following week. She discovered 20,000 German marks in cash (US$120,000 today) and financial statements indicating that their bank accounts were virtually empty. In a diary Diesel brought with him on the ship, for the date 29 September 1913, a cross was drawn, possibly indicating death. 

Ten days after he was last seen, the crew of the Dutch pilot boat &quot;Coertsen&quot; came upon the corpse of a man floating in the Eastern Scheldt. The body was in such an advanced state of decomposition that it was unrecognisable, and they did not retain it aboard because of heavy weather. Instead, the crew retrieved personal items (pill case, wallet, I.D. card, pocketknife, eyeglass case) from the clothing of the dead man, and returned the body to the sea. On 13 October, these items were identified by Rudolf&#x27;s son, Eugen Diesel, as belonging to his father. Five months later, in March 1914, Diesel’s wife, Martha, went missing in Germany.

There are various theories to explain Diesel&#x27;s death. Some, such as Diesel&#x27;s biographers Grosser (1978) and Sittauer (1978) have argued that he died by suicide. Another line of thought suggests that he was murdered, given his refusal to grant the German forces the exclusive rights to using his invention; indeed, Diesel had boarded &quot;Dresden&quot; with the intent of meeting with representatives of the Royal Navy to discuss the possibility of powering British submarines by diesel engine. Another theory is that his apparent death was a ruse staged by the British government to cover his defection to the British cause, and that he then went to Canada, worked for the Vickers shipyard in Montreal and was responsible for a sudden acceleration in its ability to produce a successful Diesel engine for submarines. Given the limited evidence at hand, his disappearance and death remain unsolved.

In 1950, Magokichi Yamaoka, the founder of Yanmar, the diesel engine manufacturer in Japan, visited West Germany and learned that there was no tomb or monument for Diesel. Yamaoka and people associated with Diesel began to make preparations to honour him. In 1957, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Diesel&#x27;s birth and the 60th anniversary of the diesel engine development, Yamaoka dedicated the Rudolf Diesel Memorial Garden (Rudolf-Diesel-Gedächtnishain) in Wittelsbacher Park in Augsburg, Bavaria, where Diesel had undertaken his early technical education and original engine development.

==Legacy==

After Diesel&#x27;s death, his engine underwent much development and became a very important replacement for the steam piston engine in many applications. Because the Diesel engine required a more robust construction than a gasoline engine, it saw limited use in aviation. However, the Diesel engine became widespread in many other applications, such as stationary engines, agricultural machines and off-highway machinery in general, submarines, ships, and much later, locomotives, trucks, and in modern automobiles.

Diesel engines have the benefit of running more fuel-efficiently than any other internal combustion engines suited for motor vehicles, allowing more heat to be converted to mechanical work.

Diesel was interested in using coal dust or vegetable oil as fuel, and in fact, his engine was run on peanut oil. Although these fuels were not better replacements, in 2008 the rise in fuel prices coupled with concerns about remaining petroleum reserves, led to the more widespread use of vegetable oil and biodiesel.

The primary fuel used in Diesel engines is the eponymous diesel fuel, derived from the refinement of crude oil. Diesel is safer to store than gasoline, because its flash point is approximately higher, and it will not explode.

===Use of vegetable oils as diesel engine fuel===

In a book titled &quot;Diesel Engines for Land and Marine Work&quot;, Diesel said that &quot;In 1900 a small Diesel engine was exhibited by the Otto company which, on the suggestion of the French Government, was run on arachide [peanut] oil, and operated so well that very few people were aware of the fact. The motor was built for ordinary oils, and without any modification was run on vegetable oil. I have recently repeated these experiments on a large scale with full success and entire confirmation of the results formerly obtained.&quot;

<text>Reform Judaism, also known as Liberal Judaism or Progressive Judaism, is a major Jewish denomination that emphasizes the evolving nature of Judaism, the superiority of its ethical aspects to its ceremonial ones, and belief in a continuous revelation which is closely intertwined with human reason and not limited to the Theophany at Mount Sinai. A highly liberal strand of Judaism, it is characterized by little stress on ritual and personal observance, regarding Jewish law as non-binding and the individual Jew as autonomous, and by a great openness to external influences and progressive values.

The origins of Reform Judaism lie in mid-19th-century Germany, where Rabbi Abraham Geiger and his associates formulated its early principles, attempting to harmonize Jewish tradition with modern sensibilities in the age of emancipation. Brought to America by German-trained rabbis, the denomination gained prominence in the United States, flourishing from the 1860s to the 1930s in an era known as &quot;Classical Reform&quot;. Since the 1970s, the movement has adopted a policy of inclusiveness and acceptance, inviting as many as possible to partake in its communities rather than adhering to strict theoretical clarity. It is strongly identified with progressive and liberal agendas in political and social terms, mainly under the traditional Jewish rubric &quot;tikkun olam&quot; (&quot;repairing of the world&quot;). &quot;Tikkun olam&quot; is a central motto of Reform Judaism, and acting in its name is one of the main channels for adherents to express their affiliation. The movement&#x27;s most significant center is in North America.

Various regional branches exist, including the Union for Reform Judaism (URJ) in the United States and Canada, the Movement for Reform Judaism (MRJ) and Liberal Judaism in the United Kingdom, the Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism (IMPJ) in Israel, and the UJR-AmLat in Latin America; these are united within the international World Union for Progressive Judaism (WUPJ). Founded in 1926, the WUPJ estimates it represents at least 1.8 million people in 50 countries, about 1 million of whom are registered adult congregants, and the rest are unaffiliated but identify with the movement. This makes Reform the second-largest Jewish denomination worldwide, after Orthodox Judaism.

==Definitions==
Its inherent pluralism and the importance it places on individual autonomy impedes any simplistic definition of Reform Judaism; its various strands regard Judaism throughout the ages as a religion that was derived from a process of constant evolution. They warrant and obligate further modifications and reject any fixed, permanent set of beliefs, laws or practices. A clear description of Reform Judaism became particularly challenging since the turn toward a policy that favored inclusiveness (&quot;Big Tent&quot; in the United States) over a coherent theology in the 1970s. This transition largely overlapped with what researchers termed the transition from &quot;Classical&quot; to &quot;New&quot; Reform Judaism in America, paralleled in the other, smaller branches of Judaism that exist across the world. The movement ceased stressing principles and core beliefs, focusing more on the personal spiritual experience and communal participation. This shift was not accompanied by a distinct new doctrine or by the abandonment of the former, but rather with ambiguity. The leadership allowed and encouraged a wide variety of positions, from selective adoption of &quot;halakhic&quot; observance to elements approaching religious humanism.

The declining importance of the theoretical foundation, in favour of pluralism and equivocalness, drew large crowds of newcomers. It also diversified Reform to a degree that made it hard to formulate a clear definition of it. Early and &quot;Classical&quot; Reform were characterized by a move away from traditional forms of Judaism combined with a coherent theology; &quot;New Reform&quot; sought, to a certain level, the reincorporation of many formerly discarded elements within the framework established during the &quot;Classical&quot; stage, though this very doctrinal basis became increasingly obfuscated. 

Critics, like Rabbi Dana Evan Kaplan, warned that Reform became more of a &quot;Jewish activities club&quot;, a means to demonstrate some affinity to one&#x27;s heritage in which even rabbinical students do not have to believe in any specific theology or engage in any particular practice, rather than a defined belief system.

==Theology==

===God===
In regard to God, the Reform movement has always officially maintained a theistic stance, affirming the belief in a personal God. Despite this official position, some voices among the spiritual leadership have approached religious and even secular humanism. This tendency has grown since the mid-20th century among both clergy and constituents, leading to broader, dimmer definitions of the concept.

Early Reform thinkers in Germany clung to this precept; the 1885 Pittsburgh Platform described the &quot;One God... The God-Idea as taught in our sacred Scripture&quot; as consecrating the Jewish people to be its priests. It was grounded on a wholly theistic understanding, although the term &quot;God-idea&quot; was excoriated by outside critics. So was the 1937 Columbus Declaration of Principles, which spoke of &quot;One, living God who rules the world&quot;. Even the 1976 San Francisco Centenary Perspective, drafted at a time of great discord among Reform theologians, upheld &quot;the affirmation of God... Challenges of modern culture have made a steady belief difficult for some. Nevertheless, we ground our lives, personally and communally, on God&#x27;s reality.&quot; The 1999 Pittsburgh Statement of Principles declared the &quot;reality and oneness of God&quot;. British Liberal Judaism affirms the &quot;Jewish conception of God: One and indivisible, transcendent and immanent, Creator and Sustainer&quot;.

===Revelation===
The basic tenet of Reform theology is a belief in a continuous, or progressive, revelation, occurring continuously and not limited to the theophany at Sinai, the defining event in traditional interpretation. According to this view, all holy scripture of Judaism, including the Torah, were authored by human beings who, although under divine inspiration, inserted their understanding and reflected the spirit of their consecutive ages. All the People of Israel are a further link in the chain of revelation, capable of reaching new insights: religion can be renewed without necessarily being dependent on past conventions. The chief promulgator of this concept was Abraham Geiger, generally considered the founder of the movement. After critical research led him to regard scripture as a human creation, bearing the marks of historical circumstances, he abandoned the belief in the unbroken perpetuity of tradition derived from Sinai and gradually replaced it with the idea of progressive revelation.

As in other liberal denominations, this notion offered a conceptual framework for reconciling the acceptance of critical research with the maintenance of a belief in some form of divine communication, thus preventing a rupture among those who could no longer accept a literal understanding of revelation. No less importantly, it provided the clergy with a rationale for adapting, changing and excising traditional mores and bypassing the accepted conventions of Jewish Law, rooted in the orthodox concept of the explicit transmission of both scripture and its oral interpretation. While also subject to change and new understanding, the basic premise of progressive revelation endures in Reform thought.

In its early days, this notion was greatly influenced by the philosophy of German idealism, from which its founders drew much inspiration: belief in humanity marching toward a full understanding of itself and the divine, manifested in moral progress towards perfection. This highly rationalistic view virtually identified human reason and intellect with divine action, leaving little room for direct influence by God. Geiger conceived revelation as occurring via the inherent &quot;genius&quot; of the People Israel, and his close ally Solomon Formstecher described it as the awakening of oneself into full consciousness of one&#x27;s religious understanding. The American theologian Kaufmann Kohler also spoke of the &quot;special insight&quot; of Israel, almost fully independent from direct divine participation, and English thinker Claude Montefiore, founder of Liberal Judaism, reduced revelation to &quot;inspiration&quot;, according intrinsic value only to the worth of its content, while &quot;it is not the place where they are found that makes them inspired&quot;. Common to all these notions was the assertion that present generations have a higher and better understanding of divine will, and they can and should unwaveringly change and refashion religious precepts.

In the decades around World War II, this rationalistic and optimistic theology was challenged and questioned. It was gradually replaced, mainly by the Jewish existentialism of Martin Buber and Franz Rosenzweig, centered on a complex, personal relationship with the creator, and a more sober and disillusioned outlook. The identification of human reason with Godly inspiration was rejected in favour of views such as Rosenzweig&#x27;s, who emphasized that the only content of revelation is it in itself, while all derivations of it are subjective, limited human understanding. However, while granting higher status to historical and traditional understanding, both insisted that &quot;revelation is certainly not Law giving&quot; and that it did not contain any &quot;finished statements about God&quot;, but, rather, that human subjectivity shaped the unfathomable content of the Encounter and interpreted it under its own limitations. The senior representative of postwar Reform theology, Eugene Borowitz, regarded theophany in postmodern terms and closely linked it with quotidian human experience and interpersonal contact. He rejected the notion of &quot;progressive revelation&quot; in the meaning of comparing human betterment with divine inspiration, stressing that past experiences were &quot;unique&quot; and of everlasting importance. Yet he stated that his ideas by no means negated the concept of ongoing, individually experienced revelation by all.

===Ritual, autonomy and law===
Reform Judaism emphasizes the ethical facets of the faith as its central attribute, superseding the ceremonial ones. Reform thinkers often cited the Prophets&#x27; condemnations of ceremonial acts, lacking true intention and performed by the morally corrupt, as testimony that rites have no inherent quality. Geiger centered his philosophy on the Prophets&#x27; teachings (he had already named his ideology &quot;Prophetic Judaism&quot; in 1838), regarding morality and ethics as the stable core of a religion in which ritual observance transformed radically through the ages. However, practices were seen as a means to elation and a link to the heritage of the past, and Reform generally argued that rituals should be maintained, discarded or modified based on whether they served these higher purposes. This stance allowed a great variety of practice both in the past and the present. In &quot;Classical&quot; times, personal observance was reduced to little beyond nothing. The postwar &quot;New Reform&quot; lent renewed importance to practical, regular action as a means to engage congregants, abandoning the sanitized forms of the &quot;Classical&quot;.

Another key aspect of Reform doctrine is the personal autonomy of each adherent, who may formulate their own understanding and expression of their religiosity. Reform is unique among all Jewish denominations in placing the individual as the authorized interpreter of Judaism. This position was originally influenced by Kantian philosophy and the great weight it lent to personal judgement and free will. This highly individualistic stance also proved one of the movement&#x27;s great challenges, for it impeded the creation of clear guidelines and standards for positive participation in religious life and definition of what was expected from members.

The notion of autonomy coincided with the gradual abandonment of traditional practice (largely neglected by most members, and the Jewish public in general, before and during the rise of Reform) in the early stages of the movement. It was a major characteristic during the &quot;Classical&quot; period, when Reform closely resembled Protestant surroundings. Later, it was applied to encourage adherents to seek their own means of engaging Judaism. &quot;New Reform&quot; embraced the criticism levied by Rosenzweig and other thinkers at extreme individualism, laying a greater stress on community and tradition. Though by no means declaring that members were bound by a compelling authority of some sort – the notion of an intervening, commanding God remained foreign to denominational thought. The &quot;New Reform&quot; approach to the question is characterized by an attempt to strike a mean between autonomy and some degree of conformity, focusing on a dialectic relationship between both.

The movement never entirely abandoned &quot;halachic&quot; (traditional jurisprudence) argumentation, both due to the need for precedent to counter external accusations and the continuity of heritage. Instead, the movement had largely made ethical considerations or the spirit of the age the decisive factor in determining its course. The German founding fathers undermined the principles behind the legalistic process, which was based on a belief in an unbroken tradition through the ages merely elaborated and applied to novel circumstances, rather than subject to change. Rabbi Samuel Holdheim advocated a particularly radical stance, arguing that the &quot;halachic&quot; Law of the Land is Law principle must be universally applied and subject virtually everything to current norms and needs, far beyond its weight in conventional Jewish Law.

While Reform rabbis in 19th-century Germany had to accommodate conservative elements in their communities, at the height of &quot;Classical Reform&quot; in the United States, &quot;halakhic&quot; considerations could be virtually ignored and Holdheim&#x27;s approach embraced. In the 1930s and onwards, Rabbi Solomon Freehof and his supporters reintroduced such elements, but they too regarded Jewish Law as too rigid a system. Instead, they recommended that selected features will be readopted and new observances established in a piecemeal fashion, as spontaneous &quot;minhag&quot; (custom) emerging by trial and error and becoming widespread if it appealed to the masses. The advocates of this approach also stress that their responsa are of non-binding nature, and their recipients may adapt them as they see fit. Freehof&#x27;s successors, such as Rabbis Walter Jacob and Moshe Zemer, further elaborated the notion of &quot;Progressive &quot;Halakha&quot;&quot; along the same lines.

===Messianic age and election===
Reform sought to accentuate and greatly augment the universalist traits in Judaism, turning it into a faith befitting the Enlightenment ideals ubiquitous at the time it emerged. The tension between universalism and the imperative to maintain uniqueness characterized the movement throughout its entire history. Its earliest proponents rejected Deism and the belief that all religions would unite into one, and it later faced the challenges of the Ethical movement and Unitarianism. Parallel to that, it sought to diminish all components of Judaism that it regarded as overly particularist and self-centered: petitions expressing hostility towards gentiles were toned down or excised, and practices were often streamlined to resemble surrounding society. &quot;New Reform&quot; laid a renewed stress on Jewish particular identity, regarding it as better suiting popular sentiment and need for preservation.

One major expression of that, which is the first clear Reform doctrine to have been formulated, is the idea of universal Messianism. The belief in redemption was unhinged from the traditional elements of return to Zion and restoration of the Temple and the sacrificial cult therein, and turned into a general hope for salvation. This was later refined when the notion of a personal Messiah who would reign over Israel was officially abolished and replaced by the concept of a Messianic Age of universal harmony and perfection. The considerable loss of faith in human progress around World War II greatly shook this ideal, but it endures as a precept of Reform.

Another key example is the reinterpretation of the election of Israel. The movement maintained the idea of the Chosen People of God, but recast it in a more universal fashion: it isolated and accentuated the notion (already present in traditional sources) that the mission of Israel was to spread among all nations and teach them divinely-inspired ethical monotheism, bringing them all closer to the Creator. One extreme &quot;Classical&quot; promulgator of this approach, Rabbi David Einhorn, substituted the lamentation on the Ninth of Av for a celebration, regarding the destruction of Jerusalem as fulfilling God&#x27;s scheme to bring his word, via his people, to all corners of the earth. Highly self-centered affirmations of Jewish exceptionalism were moderated, although the general notion of &quot;a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&quot; retained. On the other hand, while embracing a less strict interpretation compared to the traditional one, Reform also held to this tenet against those who sought to deny it. When secularist thinkers like Ahad Ha&#x27;am and Mordecai Kaplan forwarded the view of Judaism as a civilization, portraying it as a culture created by the Jewish people, rather than a God-given faith defining them, Reform theologians decidedly rejected their position – although it became popular and even dominant among rank-and-file members. Like the Orthodox, they insisted that the People Israel was created by divine election alone, and existed solely as such. The 1999 Pittsburgh Platform and other official statements affirmed that the &quot;Jewish people is bound to God by an eternal &quot;b&#x27;rit&quot;, covenant&quot;.

===Soul and afterlife===
As part of its philosophy, Reform Judaism anchored reason in divine influence, accepted scientific criticism of hallowed texts and sought to adapt Judaism to modern notions of rationalism. Judaism was viewed by Enlightenment thinkers both as irrational and an import from ancient middle-eastern pagans. The only perceived form of retribution for the wicked, if any, was the anguish of their soul after death, and vice versa, bliss was the single accolade for the spirits of the righteous. Angels and heavenly hosts were also deemed a foreign superstitious influence, especially from early Zoroastrian sources, and denied. Notions of afterlife according to Enlightenment thinkers were given to be reduced merely to the immortality of the soul, while the founding thinkers of Reform Judaism, like Montefiore, all shared this belief, the existence of a soul became harder to cling to with the passing of time. In the 1980s, Borowitz could state that the movement had nothing coherent to declare in the matter. The various streams of Reform still largely, though not always or strictly, uphold the idea. The 1999 Pittsburgh Statement of Principles, for example, used the somewhat ambiguous formula &quot;the spirit within us is eternal&quot;.

==Practice==

===Liturgy===
The first and primary field in which Reform convictions were expressed was that of prayer forms. From its beginning, Reform Judaism attempted to harmonize the language of petitions with modern sensibilities and what the constituents actually believed in. Jakob Josef Petuchowski, in his extensive survey of Progressive liturgy, listed several key principles that defined it through the years and many transformations it underwent. The prayers were abridged, whether by omitting repetitions, excising passages or reintroducing the ancient triennial cycle for reading the Torah; vernacular segments were added alongside or instead of the Hebrew and Aramaic text, to ensure the congregants understood the petitions they expressed; and some new prayers were composed to reflect the spirit of changing times. But chiefly, liturgists sought to reformulate the prayerbooks and have them express the movement&#x27;s theology. Blessings and passages referring to the coming of the Messiah, return to Zion, renewal of sacrificial practices, resurrection of the dead, reward and punishment and overt particularism of the People Israel were replaced, recast or excised altogether.

In its early stages, when Reform Judaism was more a tendency within unified communities in Central Europe than an independent movement, its advocates had to practice considerable moderation, lest they provoke conservative animosity. German prayerbooks often relegated the more contentious issues to the vernacular translation, treating the original text with great care and sometimes having problematic passages in small print and untranslated. When institutionalized and free of such constraints, it was able to pursue a more radical course. In American &quot;Classical&quot; or British Liberal prayerbooks, a far larger vernacular component was added and liturgy was drastically shortened, and petitions in discord with denominational theology eliminated.

&quot;New Reform&quot;, both in the United States and in Britain and the rest of the world, is characterized by larger affinity to traditional forms and diminished emphasis on harmonizing them with prevalent beliefs. Concurrently, it is also more inclusive and accommodating, even towards beliefs that are officially rejected by Reform theologians, sometimes allowing alternative differing rites for each congregation to choose from. Thus, prayerbooks from the mid–20th century onwards incorporated more Hebrew, and restored such elements as blessing on phylacteries. More profound changes included restoration of the &quot;Gevorot&quot; benediction in the 2007 &quot;Mishkan T&#x27;filah&quot;, with the optional &quot;give life to all/revive the dead&quot; formula. The CCAR stated this passage did not reflect a belief in Resurrection, but Jewish heritage. On the other extreme, the 1975 &quot;Gates of Prayer&quot; substituted &quot;the Eternal One&quot; for &quot;God&quot; in the English translation (though not in the original), a measure that was condemned by several Reform rabbis as a step toward religious humanism.

===Observance===
During its formative era, Reform was oriented toward lesser ceremonial obligations. In 1846, the Breslau rabbinical conference abolished the second day of festivals; during the same years, the Berlin Reform congregation held prayers without blowing the Ram&#x27;s Horn, phylacteries, mantles or head covering, and held its Sabbath services on Sunday. In the late 19th and early 20th century, American &quot;Classical Reform&quot; often emulated Berlin on a mass scale, with many communities conducting prayers along the same style and having additional services on Sunday. An official rescheduling of Sabbath to Sunday was advocated by Kaufmann Kohler for some time, though he retracted it eventually. Religious divorce was declared redundant and the civil one recognized as sufficient by American Reform in 1869, and in Germany by 1912; the laws concerning dietary and personal purity, the priestly prerogatives, marital ordinances and so forth were dispensed with, and openly revoked by the 1885 Pittsburgh Platform, which declared all ceremonial acts binding only if they served to enhance religious experience. From 1890, converts were no longer obligated to be circumcised. Similar policy was pursued by Claude Montefiore&#x27;s Jewish Religious Union, established at Britain in 1902. The Vereinigung für das Liberale Judentum in Germany, which was more moderate, declared virtually all personal observance voluntary in its 1912 guidelines.

&quot;New Reform&quot; saw the establishment and membership lay greater emphasis on the ceremonial aspects, after the former sterile and minimalist approach was condemned as offering little to engage in religion and encouraging apathy. Numerous rituals became popular again, often after being recast or reinterpreted, though as a matter of personal choice for the individual and not an authoritative obligation. Circumcision or Letting of Blood for converts and newborn babies became virtually mandated in the 1980s; ablution for menstruating women gained great grassroots popularity at the turn of the century, and some synagogues built mikvehs (ritual baths). A renewed interest in dietary laws (though by no means in the strict sense) also surfaced at the same decades, as were phylacteries, prayer shawls and head coverings. Reform is still characterized by having the least service attendance on average: for example, of those polled by Pew in 2013, only 34% of registered synagogue members (and only 17% of all those who state affinity) attend services once a month and more.

The Proto-Reform movement did pioneer new rituals. In the 1810s and 1820s, the circles (Israel Jacobson, Eduard Kley and others) that gave rise to the movement introduced confirmation ceremonies for boys and girls, in emulation of parallel Christian initiation rite. These soon spread outside the movement, though many of a more traditional leaning rejected the name &quot;confirmation&quot;. In the &quot;New Reform&quot;, Bar Mitzvah largely replaced it as part of the re-traditionalization, but many young congregants in the United States still perform one, often at Shavuot. Confirmation for girls eventually developed into the Bat Mitzvah, now popular among all except strictly Orthodox Jews.

Some branches of Reform, while subscribing to its differentiation between ritual and ethics, chose to maintain a considerable degree of practical observance, especially in areas where a conservative Jewish majority had to be accommodated. Most Liberal communities in Germany maintained dietary standards and the like in the public sphere, both due to the moderation of their congregants and threats of Orthodox secession. A similar pattern characterizes the Movement for Reform Judaism in Britain, which attempted to appeal to newcomers from the United Synagogue, or to the Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism (IMPJ) in Israel.

===Openness===
Its philosophy of continuous revelation made Progressive Judaism, in all its variants, much more able to embrace change and new trends than any of the other major denominations. 

Reform Judaism is considered to be the first major Jewish denomination to adopt gender equality in religious life. As early as 1846, the Breslau conference announced that women must enjoy identical obligations and prerogatives in worship and communal affairs, though this decision had virtually no effect in practice. Lily Montagu, who served as a driving force behind British Liberal Judaism and WUPJ, was the first woman in recorded history to deliver a sermon at a synagogue in 1918, and set another precedent when she conducted a prayer two years later. Regina Jonas, ordained in 1935 by later chairman of the Vereinigung der liberalen Rabbiner Max Dienemann, was the earliest known female rabbi to officially be granted the title. In 1972, Sally Priesand was ordained by Hebrew Union College, which made her America&#x27;s first female rabbi ordained by a rabbinical seminary, and the second formally ordained female rabbi in Jewish history, after Regina Jonas. Reform also pioneered family seating, an arrangement that spread throughout American Jewry but was only applied in continental Europe after World War II. Egalitarianism in prayer became universally prevalent in the WUPJ by the end of the 20th century.

Religious inclusion for LGBT people and ordination of LGBT rabbis were also pioneered by the movement. Intercourse between consenting adults was declared as legitimate by the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1977, and openly gay clergy were admitted by the end of the 1980s. Same-sex marriage was sanctioned by the year 2000. In 2015, the URJ adopted a Resolution on the Rights of Transgender and Gender Non-Conforming People, urging clergy and synagogue attendants to actively promote tolerance and inclusion of such individuals.

American Reform, especially, turned action for social and progressive causes into an important part of religious commitment. From the second half of the 20th century, it employed the old rabbinic notion of &quot;Tikkun Olam&quot;, &quot;repairing the world&quot;, as a slogan under which constituents were encouraged to partake in various initiatives for the betterment of society. The Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism became an important lobby in service of progressive causes such as the rights of minorities. &quot;Tikkun Olam&quot; has become the central venue for active participation for many affiliates, even leading critics to negatively describe Reform as little more than a means employed by Jewish liberals to claim that commitment to their political convictions was also a religious activity and demonstrates fealty to Judaism. Dana Evan Kaplan stated that &quot;&quot;Tikkun Olam&quot; has incorporated only leftist, socialist-like elements. In truth, it is political, basically a mirror of the most radically leftist components of the Democratic Party platform, causing many to say that Reform Judaism is simply &#x27;the Democratic Party with Jewish holidays&#x27;.&quot; In Israel, the Religious Action Center is very active in the judicial field, often using litigation both in cases concerning civil rights in general and the official status of Reform Judaism within the state, in particular.

===Jewish identity===
While opposed to interfaith marriage in principle, officials of the major Reform rabbinical organisation, the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), estimated in 2012 that about half of their rabbis partake in such ceremonies. The need to cope with this phenomenon – 80% of all Reform-raised Jews in the United States wed between 2000 and 2013 were intermarried – led to the recognition of patrilineal descent: all children born to a couple in which a single member was Jewish, whether mother or father, was accepted as a Jew on condition that they received corresponding education and committed themselves as such. Conversely, offspring of a Jewish mother only are not accepted if they do not demonstrate affinity to the faith. A Jewish status is conferred unconditionally only on the children of two Jewish parents.

This decision was taken by the British Liberal Judaism in the 1950s. The North American Union for Reform Judaism (URJ) accepted it in 1983, and the British Movement for Reform Judaism affirmed it in 2015. The various strands also adopted a policy of embracing the intermarried and their spouses. British Liberals offer &quot;blessing ceremonies&quot; if the child is to be raised Jewish, and the MRJ allows its clergy to participate in celebration of civil marriage, though none allow a full Jewish ceremony with &quot;chupah&quot; and the like. In American Reform, 17% of synagogue-member households have a converted spouse, and 26% an unconverted one. Its policy on conversion and Jewish status led the WUPJ into conflict with more traditional circles, and a growing number of its adherents are not accepted as Jewish by either the Conservative or the Orthodox. Outside North America and Britain, patrilineal descent was not accepted by most. As in other fields, small WUPJ affiliates are less independent and often have to deal with more conservative Jewish denominations in their countries, such as vis-à-vis the Orthodox rabbinate in Israel or continental Europe.

===Conversion===
Conversion within Reform Judaism has been seen as controversial by the Orthodox and Masorti sects. Due to the Reform movement&#x27;s progressive views on what it means to be a Jew, the conversion process has been criticized and often unrecognized by more conservative sects, yet conversions through the Reform movement are legally recognized by the Israeli government and thus entitled to citizenship under the Law of Return. 

Converts through Reform Judaism are accepted based on their sincerity, regardless of their background or previous beliefs. Studying with a rabbi is the norm and can take anywhere from several months to several years. The process focuses on participation in congregational activities and observation of holidays and Halakha. Conversions are finalized with a meeting of the Beit Din and usually a Brit Milah and a Tevilah, though the extent to which the practice of Brit Milah is observed varies from country to country. Furthermore, the acceptance of Reform converts by other sects is rare, with many Orthodox and Masorti temples rejecting Reform Converts.

==Organization and demographics==

The term &quot;Reform&quot; was first applied institutionally – not generically, as in &quot;for reform&quot; – to the Berlin Reformgemeinde (Reform Congregation), established in 1845. Apart from it, most German communities that were oriented in that direction preferred the more ambiguous &quot;Liberal&quot;, which was not exclusively associated with Reform Judaism. It was more prevalent as an appellation for the religiously apathetic majority among German Jews, and also to all rabbis who were not clearly Orthodox (including the rival Positive-Historical School). The title &quot;Reform&quot; became much more common in the United States, where an independent denomination under this name was fully identified with the religious tendency. However, Isaac Meyer Wise suggested in 1871 that &quot;Progressive Judaism&quot; was a better epithet. When the movement was institutionalized in Germany between 1898 and 1908, its leaders chose &quot;Liberal&quot; as self-designation, founding the Vereinigung für das Liberale Judentum. In 1902, Claude Montefiore termed the doctrine espoused by his new Jewish Religious Union as &quot;Liberal Judaism&quot;, too, though it belonged to the more radical part of the spectrum in relation to the German one.

In 1926, British Liberals, American Reform and German Liberals consolidated their worldwide movement – united in affirming tenets such as progressive revelation, supremacy of ethics above ritual and so forth – at a meeting held in London. Originally carrying the provisional title &quot;International Conference of Liberal Jews&quot;, after deliberations between &quot;Liberal&quot;, &quot;Reform&quot; and &quot;Modern&quot;, it was named World Union for Progressive Judaism on 12 July, at the conclusion of a vote. The WUPJ established further branches around the planet, alternatively under the names &quot;Reform&quot;, &quot;Liberal&quot; and &quot;Progressive&quot;. In 1945, the Associated British Synagogues (later Movement for Reform Judaism) joined as well. In 1990, Reconstructionist Judaism entered the WUPJ as an observer. Espousing another religious worldview, it became the only non-Reform member. The WUPJ claims to represent a total of at least 1.8 million people – these figures do not take into account the 2013 PEW survey, and rely on the older URJ estimate of a total of 1.5 million presumed to have affinity, since updated to 2.2 million – both registered synagogue members and non-affiliates who identify with it.

Worldwide, the movement is mainly centered in North America. The largest WUPJ constituent by far is the Union for Reform Judaism (until 2003: Union of American Hebrew Congregations) in the United States and Canada. As of 2013, a Pew Research Center survey calculated it represented about 35% of all 5.3 million Jewish adults in the U.S., making it the single most numerous Jewish religious group in the country. Steven M. Cohen deduced there were 756,000 adult Jewish synagogue members – about a quarter of households had an unconverted spouse (according to 2001 findings), adding some 90,000 non-Jews and making the total constituency roughly 850,000 – and further 1,154,000 &quot;Reform-identified non-members&quot; in the United States. There are also 30,000 in Canada. Based on these, the URJ claims to represent 2.2 million people. It has 845 congregations in the U.S. and 27 in Canada, the vast majority of the 1,170 affiliated with the WUPJ that are not Reconstructionist. Its rabbinical arm is the Central Conference of American Rabbis, with some 2,300 member rabbis, mainly trained in Hebrew Union College. As of 2015, the URJ was led by President Rabbi Richard Jacobs, and the CCAR headed by Rabbi Denise Eger.

The next in size, by a wide margin, are the two British WUPJ-affiliates. In 2010, the Movement for Reform Judaism and Liberal Judaism respectively had 16,125 and 7,197 member households in 45 and 39 communities, or 19.4% and 8.7% of British Jews registered at a synagogue. Other member organizations are based in forty countries around the world. They include the Union progressiver Juden in Deutschland, which had some 4,500 members in 2010 and incorporates 25 congregations, one in Austria; the Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom, with 3,500 affiliates in 10 communities; the 13 Liberal synagogues in France; the Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism (5,000 members in 2000, 35 communities); the Movement for Progressive Judaism (Движение прогрессивного Иудаизма) in the CIS and Baltic States, with 61 affiliates in Russia, Ukraine and Belarus and several thousands of regular constituents; and many other, smaller ones.

==History==

===Beginnings===

With the advent of Jewish emancipation and acculturation in Central Europe during the late 18th century, and the breakdown of traditional Jewish life, the proper response to the changed circumstances became a heated concern. Radical, second-generation Berlin &quot;maskilim&quot; (Enlightened), like Lazarus Bendavid and David Friedländer, proposed to reduce Judaism to little above Deism, or allow it to dissipate entirely. A more palatable course was the reform of worship in synagogues, making them more attractive to a generation whose aesthetic and moral taste became attuned to that of Christian surroundings. The first considered to have implemented such a course was the Amsterdam Ashkenazi congregation, &quot;Adath Jessurun&quot;, In 1796. Emulating the local Sephardic custom, it omitted the &quot;Father of Mercy&quot; prayer, beseeching God to take revenge upon the gentiles. The short-lived community employed fully traditional (&quot;orthodox&quot;) argumentation to legitimize its actions, but is often regarded a harbinger by historians.

A relatively thoroughgoing program was adopted by Israel Jacobson, a philanthropist from the Kingdom of Westphalia. Faith and observance were eroded for decades both by Enlightenment criticism and apathy, but Jacobson himself did not bother with those. He was interested in decorum, believing its lack in services was driving the young away. Many of the aesthetic reforms he pioneered, like a regular vernacular sermon on moralistic themes, would be later adopted by the modernist Orthodox. On 17 July 1810, he dedicated a synagogue in Seesen that employed an organ and a choir during prayer and introduced some German liturgy. While Jacobson was far from full-fledged Reform Judaism, this day was adopted by the movement worldwide as its foundation date. The Seesen temple – a designation quite common for prayerhouses at the time; &quot;temple&quot; would later become, somewhat misleadingly (and not exclusively), identified with Reform institutions via association with the elimination of prayers for the Jerusalem Temple – closed in 1813. Jacobson moved to Berlin and established a similar synagogue, which became a hub for like-minded intellectuals, interested in the betterment of religious experience. Though the prayerbook used in Berlin did introduce several deviations from the received text, it did so without an organizing principle. In 1818, Jacobson&#x27;s acquaintance Edward Kley founded the Hamburg Temple. Here, changes in the rite were eclectic no more and had severe dogmatic implications: prayers for the restoration of sacrifices by the Messiah and Return to Zion were quite systematically omitted. The Hamburg edition is considered the first comprehensive Reform liturgy.

While Orthodox protests to Jacobson&#x27;s initiatives had been scant, dozens of rabbis throughout Europe united to ban the Hamburg Temple. The Hamburg reformers, still attempting to play within the limits of rabbinic tradition, cited canonical sources in defence of their actions; they had the grudging support of one liberal-minded rabbi, Aaron Chorin of Arad, though even he never acceded to the removal of prayers for the sacrifices. 

The massive Orthodox reaction halted the advance of early Reform, confining it to the port city for the next twenty years. As acculturation and resulting religious apathy spread, many synagogues introduced mild aesthetic changes, such as vernacular sermons or somber conduct, yet these were carefully crafted to assuage conservative elements (though the staunchly Orthodox opposed them anyhow; secular education for rabbis, for example, was much resisted). One of the first to adopt such modifications was Hamburg&#x27;s own Orthodox community, under the newly appointed modern Rabbi Isaac Bernays. The less strict but still traditional Isaac Noah Mannheimer of the Vienna Stadttempel and Michael Sachs in Prague, set the pace for most of Central and Western Europe. They significantly altered custom, but wholly avoided dogmatic issues or overt injury to Jewish Law.
An isolated, yet much more radical step in the same direction as Hamburg&#x27;s, was taken across the ocean in 1824. The younger congregants in the Charleston synagogue &quot;Beth Elohim&quot; were disgruntled by present conditions and demanded change. Led by Isaac Harby and other associates, they formed their own prayer group, &quot;The Reformed Society of Israelites&quot;. Apart from strictly aesthetic matters, like having sermons and synagogue affairs delivered in English, rather than Middle Spanish (as was customary among Western Sephardim), they had almost their entire liturgy solely in the vernacular, in a far greater proportion compared to the Hamburg rite. And chiefly, they felt little attachment to the traditional Messianic doctrine and possessed a clearly heterodox religious understanding. In their new prayerbook, authors Harby, Abram Moïse and David Nunes Carvalho unequivocally excised pleas for the restoration of the Jerusalem Temple; during his inaugural address on 21 November 1825, Harby stated their native country was their only Zion, not &quot;some stony desert&quot;, and described the rabbis of old as &quot;Fabulists and Sophists... Who tortured the plainest precepts of the Law into monstrous and unexpected inferences&quot;. The Society was short-lived, and they merged back into Beth Elohim in 1833. As in Germany, the reformers were laymen, operating in a country with little rabbinic presence.

===Consolidation in German lands===
In the 1820s and 1830s, philosophers like Solomon Steinheim imported German idealism into the Jewish religious discourse, attempting to draw from the means it employed to reconcile Christian faith and modern sensibilities. But it was the new scholarly, critical Science of Judaism (&quot;Wissenschaft des Judentums&quot;) that became the focus of controversy. Its proponents vacillated whether and to what degree it should be applied against the contemporary plight. Opinions ranged from the strictly Orthodox Azriel Hildesheimer, who subjugated research to the predetermined sanctity of the texts and refused to allow it practical implication over received methods; via the Positive-Historical Zecharias Frankel, who did not deny &quot;Wissenschaft&quot; a role, but only in deference to tradition, and opposed analysis of the Pentateuch; and up to Abraham Geiger, who rejected any limitations on objective research or its application. He is considered the founding father of Reform Judaism.

Geiger wrote that at seventeen already, he discerned that the late &quot;Tannaim&quot; and the &quot;Amoraim&quot; imposed a subjective interpretation on the Oral Torah, attempting to diffuse its revolutionary potential by linking it to the biblical text. Believing that Judaism became stale and had to be radically transformed if it were to survive modernity, he found little use in the legal procedures of &quot;halakha&quot;, arguing that hardline rabbis often demonstrated they will not accept major innovations anyway. His venture into higher criticism led him to regard the Pentateuch as reflecting power struggles between the Pharisees on one hand, and the Saducees who had their own pre-Mishnaic &quot;halakha&quot;. Having concluded the belief in an unbroken tradition back to Sinai or a divinely dictated Torah could not be maintained, he began to articulate a theology of progressive revelation, presenting the Pharisees as reformers who revolutionized the Saducee-dominated religion. His other model were the Prophets, whose morals and ethics were to him the only true, permanent core of Judaism. He was not alone: Solomon Formstecher argued that Revelation was God&#x27;s influence on human psyche, rather than encapsulated in law; Aaron Bernstein was apparently the first to deny inherent sanctity to any text when he wrote in 1844 that, &quot;The Pentateuch is not a &quot;chronicle&quot; of God&#x27;s revelation, it is a &quot;testimony&quot; to the inspiration His consciousness had on our forebears.&quot; Many others shared similar convictions.

In 1837, Geiger hosted a conference of like-minded young rabbis in Wiesbaden. He told the assembled that the &quot;Talmud must go&quot;. In 1841, the Hamburg Temple issued a second edition of its prayerbook, the first Reform liturgy since its predecessor of 1818. Orthodox response was weak and quickly defeated. Most rabbinic posts in Germany were now manned by university graduates susceptible to rationalistic ideas, which also permeated liberal Protestantism led by such figures as Leberecht Uhlich. They formed the backbone of the nascent Reform rabbinate. Geiger intervened in the Second Hamburg Temple controversy not just to defend the prayerbook against the Orthodox, but also to denounce it, stating the time of mainly aesthetic and unsystematic reforms has passed. In 1842, the power of progressive forces was revealed again: when Geiger&#x27;s superior Rabbi Solomon Tiktin attempted to dismiss him from the post of preacher in Breslau, 15 of 17 rabbis consulted by the board stated his unorthodox views were congruous with his post. He himself differentiated between his principled stance and quotidian conduct. Believing it could be implemented only carefully, he was moderate in practice and remained personally observant.

Second only to Geiger, Rabbi Samuel Holdheim distinguished himself as a radical proponent of change. While the former stressed continuity with the past and described Judaism as an entity that gradually adopted and discarded elements along time, Holdheim accorded present conditions the highest status, sharply dividing the universalist core from all other aspects that could be unremittingly disposed of. Declaring that old laws lost their hold on Jews as it were and the rabbi could only act as a guide for voluntary observance, his principle was that the concept of &quot;the Law of the Land is the Law&quot; was total. He declared mixed marriage permissible – almost the only Reform rabbi to do so in history; his contemporaries and later generations opposed this – for the Talmudic ban on conducting them on Sabbath, unlike offering sacrifice and other acts, was to him sufficient demonstration that they belonged not to the category of sanctified obligations (&quot;issurim&quot;) but to the civil ones (&quot;memonot&quot;), where the Law of the Land applied. Another measure he offered, rejected almost unanimously by his colleagues in 1846, was the institution of a &quot;Second Sabbath&quot; on Sunday, modeled on Second Passover, as most people desecrated the day of rest.

The pressures of the late Vormärz era were intensifying. In 1842, a group of radical laymen determined to achieve full acceptance into society was founded in Frankfurt, the &quot;Friends of Reform&quot;. They abolished circumcision and declared that the Talmud was no longer binding. In response to pleas from Frankfurt, virtually all rabbis in Germany, even Holdheim, declared circumcision obligatory. Similar groups sprang in Breslau and Berlin. These developments, and the need to bring uniformity to practical reforms implemented piecemeal in the various communities, motivated Geiger and his like-minded supporters into action. Between 1844 and 1846, they convened three rabbinical assemblies, in Braunschweig, Frankfurt am Main and Breslau respectively. Those were intended to implement the proposals of Aaron Chorin and others for a new &quot;Sanhedrin&quot;, made already in 1826, that could assess and eliminate various ancient decrees and prohibitions. A total of forty-two people attended the three meetings, including moderates and conservatives, all quite young, usually in their thirties.

The conferences made few concrete far-reaching steps, albeit they generally stated that the old mechanisms of religious interpretation were obsolete. The first, held on 12–19 June 1844, abolished &quot;Kol Nidrei&quot; and the humiliating Jewish oath, still administered by rabbis, and established a committee to determine &quot;to which degree the Messianic ideal should be mentioned in prayer&quot;. Repeating the response of the 1806 Paris Grand Sanhedrin to Napoleon, it declared intermarriage permissible as long as children could be raised Jewish; this measure effectively banned such unions without offending Christians, as no state in Germany allowed mixed-faith couples to have non-Christians education for offspring. It enraged critics anyhow. A small group of traditionalists also attended, losing all votes. On the opposite wing were sympathizers of Holdheim, who declared on 17 June that &quot;science already demonstrated that the Talmud has no authority either from the dogmatic or practical perspective... The men of the Great Assembly had jurisdiction only for their time. We possess the same power, when we express the spirit of ours.&quot; The majority was led by Geiger and Ludwig Philippson and was keen on moderation and historical continuity.

The harsh response from the strictly Orthodox came as no surprise. Moshe Schick declared &quot;they have blasphemed against the Divinity of the Law, they are no Israelites and equal to Gentiles&quot;. Yet they also managed to antagonize more moderate progressives. Both S. L. Rapoport and Zecharias Frankel strongly condemned Braunschweig. Another discontented party were Christian missionaries, who feared Reform on two accounts: it could stem the massive tide of conversions, and loosen Jewish piety in favor of liberal, semi-secularized religion that they opposed among Christians as well, reducing the possibility they would ever accept new dogma fully.

Frankel was convinced to attend the next conference, held in Frankfurt on 15–28 July 1845, after many pleas. But he walked out after it passed a resolution that there were subjective, but no objective, arguments for retaining Hebrew in the liturgy. While this was quite a trivial statement, well grounded in canonical sources, Frankel regarded it as a deliberate breach with tradition and irreverence toward the collective Jewish sentiment. The 1840s, commented Meyer, saw the crystallization of Reform, narrowing from &quot;reformers (in the generic sense)&quot; who wished to modernize Judaism to some degree or other (including both Frankel and the Neo-Orthodox Samson Raphael Hirsch) &quot;a broad stream that embraced all opponents of the premodern status quo... to a more clearly marked current which rejected not only the religious mentality of the ghetto, but also the modernist Orthodoxy which altered form but not substance&quot;. After his withdrawal, the conference adopted another key doctrine that Frankel opposed, and officially enshrined the idea of a future Messianic era rather than a personal redeemer. Rabbi David Einhorn elucidated a further notion, that of the Mission to bring ethical monotheism to all people, commenting that, &quot;Exile was once perceived as a disaster, but it was progress. Israel approached its true destiny, with sanctity replacing blood sacrifice. It was to spread the Word of the Lord to the four corners of the earth.&quot;

The last meeting, convened in Breslau (13–24 July 1846), was the most innocuous. The Sabbath, widely desecrated by the majority of German Jews, was discussed. Participants argued whether leniencies for civil servants should be enacted but could not agree and released a general statement about its sanctity. Holdheim shocked the assembled when he proposed his &quot;Second Sabbath&quot; scheme, astonishing even the radical wing, and his motion was rejected offhand. They did vote to eliminate the Second Day of Festivals, noting it was both an irrelevant rabbinic ordinance and scarcely observed anyway.

While eliciting protest from the Orthodox, Frankfurt and Breslau also incensed the radical laity, which regarded them as too acquiescent. In March 1845, a small group formed a semi-independent congregation in Berlin, the Reformgemeinde. They invited Holdheim to serve as their rabbi, though he was often at odds with the board led by Sigismund Stern. They instituted a drastically abridged prayerbook in German and allowed the abolition of most ritual aspects.

Practice and liturgy were modified in numerous German congregations. Until the conferences, the only Reform prayerbooks ever printed in Europe were the two Hamburg editions. In the 1850s and 1860s, dozens of new prayerbooks which omitted or rephrased the cardinal theological segments of temple sacrifice, ingathering of exiles, Messiah, resurrection and angels – rather than merely abbreviating the service; excising non-essential parts, especially piyyutim, was common among moderate Orthodox and conservatives too – were authored in Germany for mass usage, demonstrating the prevalence of the new religious ideology. And yet, Geiger and most of the conferences&#x27; participants were far more moderate than Holdheim. While he administered in a homogeneous group, they had to serve in unified communities, in which traditionalists held separate services but still had to be respected. Changes were decidedly restrained. Liturgists were often careful when introducing their changes into the Hebrew text of prayers, less than with the German translation, and some level of traditional observance was maintained in public. Except Berlin, where the term &quot;Reform&quot; was first used as an adjective, the rest referred to themselves as &quot;Liberal&quot;.

Two further rabbinical conferences much later, in 1869 and 1871 at Leipzig and Augsburg respectively, were marked with a cautious tone. Their only outcome was the bypassing of the Loosening of the Shoe ceremony via a prenuptial agreement and the establishment of the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums, though officially non-denominational, as a rabbinical seminary. While common, noted Michael Meyer, the designation &quot;Liberal Jew&quot; was more associated with political persuasion than religious conviction. The general Jewish public in Germany demonstrated little interest, especially after the 1876 law under which communal affiliation and paying parish taxes were no longer mandatory.

Outside Germany, Reform had little to no influence in the rest of the continent. Radical lay societies sprang in Hungary during the 1848 Revolution but soon dispersed. Only in Germany, commented Steven M. Lowenstein, did the extinction of old Jewish community life led to the creation of a new, positive religious ideology that advocated principled change. In Western and Central Europe, personal observance disappeared, but the public was not interested in bridging the gap between themselves and the official faith. Secular education for clergy became mandated by mid-century, and &quot;yeshivas&quot; all closed due to lack of applicants, replaced by modern seminaries; the new academically trained rabbinate, whether affirming basically traditional doctrines or liberal and influenced by &quot;Wissenschaft&quot;, was scarcely prone to anything beyond aesthetic modifications and de facto tolerance of the laity&#x27;s apathy. Further to the east, among the unemancipated and unacculturated Jewish masses in Poland, Romania and Russia, the stimulants that gave rise either to Reform or modernist Orthodoxy were scarce. The few rich and westernized Jews in cities like Odessa or Warsaw constructed modern synagogues where mild aesthetic reforms, like vernacular sermons or holding the wedding canopy indoors, rather than under the sky, were introduced. Regarded as boldly innovative in their environs, these were long since considered trivial even by the most Orthodox in Germany, Bohemia or Moravia. In the east, the belated breakdown of old mores led not to the remodification of religion, but to the formulation of secular conceptions of Jewishness, especially nationalistic ones.

In 1840, several British Jews formed the West London Synagogue of British Jews, headed by Reverend David Woolf Marks. While the title &quot;Reform&quot; was occasionally applied to them, their approach was described as &quot;neo-Karaite&quot; and was utterly opposite to continental developments. Only a century later did they and other synagogues embrace mainland ideas and established the British Movement for Reform Judaism.

===America and Classical Reform===

At Charleston, the former members of the Reformed Society gained influence over the affairs of &quot;Beth Elohim&quot;. In 1836, Gustavus Poznanski was appointed minister. At first traditional, but around 1841, he excised the Resurrection of the Dead and abolished the Second day of festivals, five years before the same was done at the Breslau conference.

Apart from that, the American Reform movement was chiefly a direct German import. In 1842, Har Sinai Congregation was founded by German-Jewish immigrants in Baltimore. Adopting the Hamburg rite, it was the first synagogue established as Reformed on the continent. In the new land, there were neither old state-mandated communal structures, nor strong conservative elements among the newcomers. While the first generation was still somewhat traditional, their Americanized children were keen on a new religious expression. Reform quickly spread even before the Civil War. While fueled by the condition of immigrant communities, in matters of doctrine, wrote Michael Meyer, &quot;However much a response to its particular social context, the basic principles are those put forth by Geiger and the other German Reformers – progressive revelation, historical-critical approach, the centrality of the Prophetic literature.&quot;

The rabbinate was almost exclusively transplanted – Rabbis Samuel Hirsch, Samuel Adler, Gustav Gottheil, Kaufmann Kohler, and others all played a role both in Germany and across the ocean – and led by two individuals: the radical Rabbi David Einhorn, who participated in the 1844–1846 conferences and was very much influenced by Holdheim (though utterly rejecting mixed marriage), and the moderate pragmatist Isaac Meyer Wise, who while sharing deeply heterodox views was more an organizer than a thinker. Wise was distinct from the others, arriving early in 1846 and lacking much formal education. He was of little ideological consistency, often willing to compromise.

Quite haphazardly, Wise instituted a major innovation when introducing family pews in 1851, after his Albany congregation purchased a local church building and retained sitting arrangements. While it was gradually adopted even by many Orthodox Jews in America, and remained so well into the 20th century, the same was not applied in Germany until after World War II. Wise attempted to reach consensus with the traditionalist leader Rabbi Isaac Leeser in order to forge a single, unified, American Judaism. In the 1855 Cleveland Synod, he was at first acquiescent to Leeser, but reverted immediately after the other departed. The enraged Leeser disavowed any connection with him. Yet Wise&#x27;s harshest critic was Einhorn, who arrived from Europe in the same year. Demanding clear positions, he headed the radical camp as Reform turned into a distinct current.

On 3–6 November 1869, the two and their followers met in Philadelphia. Described by Meyer as American Reform&#x27;s &quot;declaration of independence&quot;, they stated their commitment to the principles already formulated in Germany: priestly privileges, the belief in Resurrection, and a personal Messiah were denied. A practical, far-reaching measure, not instituted in the home country until 1910, was acceptance of civil marriage and divorce. A &quot;get&quot; was no longer required. In 1873, Wise founded the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (since 2003, Union for Reform Judaism), the denominational body. In 1875, he established the movement&#x27;s rabbinical seminary, Hebrew Union College, at Cincinnati, Ohio. He and Einhorn also quarreled in the matter of liturgy, each issuing his own prayerbook, &quot;Minhag America&quot; (American Rite) and &quot;Olat Tamid&quot; (Regular Burnt Offering) respectively, which they hoped to make standard issue. Eventually, the Union Prayer Book was adopted in 1895. The movement spread rapidly: in 1860, when it began its ascent, there were few Reform synagogues and 200 Orthodox in the United States. By 1880, a mere handful of the existing 275 were not affiliated with it.

The proponents of Reform or progressive forms of Judaism had consistently claimed since the early nineteenth-century that they sought to reconcile Jewish religion with the best of contemporary scientific thought. The science of evolution was arguably the scientific idea that drew the most sustained interest. A good example is the series of twelve sermons published as &quot;The Cosmic God&quot; (1876) by Isaac Meyer Wise, who offered an alternative theistic account of transmutation to that of Darwinism, which he dismissed as ‘homo-brutalism’. Other Reform rabbis who were more sympathetic to Darwinian conceptions of evolution were Kaufmann Kohler, Emil G. Hirsch, and Joseph Krauskopf. These engaged with high-profile sceptics and atheists such as Robert Ingersoll and Felix Adler as well as with proponents of biological evolutionary theory, with the result that a distinctly panentheistic character of US Reform Jewish theology was observable.

In 1885, Reform Judaism in America was confronted by challenges from both flanks. To the left, Felix Adler and his Ethical Movement rejected the need for the Jews to exist as a differentiated group. On the right, the recently arrived Rabbi Alexander Kohut, an adherent of Zecharias Frankel, lambasted it for having abandoned traditional Judaism. Einhorn&#x27;s son-in-law and chief ideologue, Rabbi Kaufmann Kohler, invited leading rabbis to formulate a response. The eight clauses of the Pittsburgh Platform were proclaimed on 19 November. It added virtually nothing new to the tenets of Reform, but rather elucidated them, declaring unambiguously that: &quot;Today, we accept as binding only the moral laws, and maintain only such ceremonies as elevate and sanctify our lives.&quot; The platform was never officially ratified by either the UAHC or HUC, and many of their members even attempted to disassociate from it, fearing that its radical tone would deter potential allies. It indeed motivated a handful of conservatives to cease any cooperation with the movement and withdraw their constituencies from the UAHC. Those joined Kohut and Sabato Morais in establishing the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. It united all non-Reform currents in the country and would gradually develop into the locus of Conservative Judaism.

The Pittsburgh Platform is considered a defining document of the sanitized and rationalistic &quot;Classical Reform&quot;, dominant from the 1860s to the 1930s. At its height, some forty congregations adopted the Sunday Sabbath and UAHC communities had services without most traditional elements, in a manner seen in Europe only at the Berlin Reformgemeinde. In 1889, Wise founded the Central Conference of American Rabbis (CCAR), the denominational rabbinic council.

However, change loomed on the horizon. From 1881 to 1924, over 2,400,000 immigrants from Eastern Europe drastically altered American Jewry, increasing it tenfold. The 40,000 members of Reform congregations became a small minority overnight. The newcomers arrived from backward regions, where modern education was scarce and civil equality nonexistent, retaining a strong sense of Jewish ethnicity. Even the ideological secularists among them, all the more so the common masses which merely turned lax or nonobservant, had a very traditional understanding of worship and religious conduct. The leading intellectuals of Eastern European Jewish nationalism castigated western Jews in general, and Reform Judaism in particular, not on theological grounds which they as laicists wholly rejected, but for what they claimed to be assimilationist tendencies and the undermining of peoplehood. This sentiment also fueled the manner in which the denomination is perceived in Israeli society, originally established on the basis of these ideologies.

While at first alienated from all native modernized Jews, a fortiori the Reform ones, the Eastern Europeans did slowly integrate. Growing numbers did begin to enter UAHC prayerhouses. The CCAR soon readopted elements long discarded in order to appeal to them: In the 1910s, inexperienced rabbis in the East Coast were given as shofars ram horns fitted with a trumpet mouthpiece, seventy years after the Reformgemeinde first held High Holiday prayers without blowing the instrument. The five-day workweek soon made the Sunday Sabbath redundant. Temples in the South and the Midwest, where the new crowd was scant, remained largely Classical.

===The World Union===

In Germany, Liberal communities stagnated since mid-century. Full and complete Jewish emancipation granted to all in the German Empire in 1871 largely diffused interest in harmonizing religion with &quot;Zeitgeist&quot;. Immigration from Eastern Europe also strengthened traditional elements. In 1898, seeking to counter these trends, Rabbi Heinemann Vogelstein established the Union of Liberal Rabbis (Vereinigung der liberalen Rabbiner). It numbered 37 members at first and grew to include 72 by 1914, about half of Germany&#x27;s Jewish clergy, a proportion maintained until 1933. In 1908, Vogelstein and Rabbi Cäsar Seligmann also founded a congregational arm, the Union for Liberal Judaism in Germany (&quot;Vereinigung für das Liberale Judentum in Deutschland&quot;), finally institutionalizing the current that until then was active as a loose tendency. The Union had some 10,000 registered members in the 1920s. In 1912, Seligmann drafted a declaration of principles, &quot;Guiding Lines towards a Program for Liberal Judaism&quot; (Richtlinien zu einem Programm für das liberale Judentum). It stressed the importance of individual consciousness and the supremacy of ethical values to ritual practice, declared a belief in a messianic age and was adopted as &quot;a recommendation&quot;, rather than a binding decision.

In 1902, Claude Montefiore and several friends, including Lily Montagu and Israel Abrahams, founded the Jewish Religious Union (JRU) in London. It served as the cornerstone of Liberal Judaism in Britain. Montefiore was greatly influenced by the ideas of early German Reformers. He and his associates were mainly driven by the example and challenge of Unitarianism, which offered upper-class Jews a universal, enlightened belief. Meyer noted that while he had original strains, Montefiore was largely dependent on Geiger and his concepts of progressive revelation, instrumentality of ritual et cetera. His Liberal Judaism was radical and puristic, matching and sometimes exceeding the Berlin and American variants. They sharply abridged liturgy and largely discarded practice. Langton has argued for the distinctly Anglo-Jewish character of the movement, which was dominated by Montefiore&#x27;s idiosyncratic ideas.
In 1907, the former Consistorial rabbi Louis Germain Lévy who shared a similar worldview, formed the Union Libérale Israélite de France, a small congregation that numbered barely a hundred families. It eventually evolved into the Liberal Jewish Movement of France.

Seligmann first suggested the creation of an international organization. On 10 July 1926, representatives from around the world gathered in London. Rabbi Jacob K. Shankman wrote they were all &quot;animated by the convictions of Reform Judaism: emphasized the Prophets&#x27; teachings as the cardinal element, progressive revelation, willingness to adapt ancient forms to contemporary needs&quot;. The conference was attended by representatives of the German Liberal Union, the British JRU, the American UAHC and CCAR, and Lévy from France. After weighing their options, they chose &quot;Progressive&quot;, rather than either &quot;Liberal&quot; or &quot;Reform&quot;, as their name, founding the World Union for Progressive Judaism. It began to sponsor new chapters globally. The first was founded in the Netherlands, where two synagogues formed the Verbond voor Liberaal-Religieuze Joden in Nederland on 18 October 1931.

Already in 1930, the West London Synagogue affiliated with WUPJ. In the coming decade, waves of refugees from Nazi Germany arrived in Britain, bringing with them both the moderation of German Liberal Judaism (few mingled with the radical JRU) and a cadre of trained rabbis. Only then did British Reform emerge as a movement. 1942 saw the founding of the Associated British Synagogues, which joined the WUPJ in 1945. Preserving the relative traditionalism of Germany, they later adopted the name &quot;Reform Synagogues of Great Britain&quot; (since 2005, Movement for Reform Judaism), distinct from the smaller &quot;Union of Liberal and Progressive Synagogues&quot;, which succeeded the JRU. Tens of thousands of refugees from Germany brought their Liberal Judaism to other lands as well. In 1930, the first Liberal congregation, Temple Beth Israel Melbourne, was founded in Australia. In June 1931, the South African Jewish Religious Union for Liberal Judaism was organised, soon employing HUC-ordained Moses Cyrus Weiler. The Congregação Israelita Paulista of São Paulo, first branch in South America, was established in 1936. German refugees also founded a Liberal community named &quot;Emet ve-Emuna&quot; in Jerusalem, but it joined the Conservatives by 1949.

===The New Reform Judaism===

Kohler retired in 1923. Rabbi Samuel S. Cohon was appointed HUC Chair of Theology in his stead, serving until 1956. Cohon, born near Minsk, was emblematic of the new generation of East European-descended clergy within American Reform. Deeply influenced by Ahad Ha&#x27;am and Mordecai Kaplan, he viewed Judaism as a Civilization, rather than a religion, though he and other Reform sympathizers of Kaplan fully maintained the notions of Election and revelation, which the latter denied. Cohon valued Jewish particularism over universalist leanings, encouraging the reincorporation of traditional elements long discarded, not as part of a comprehensive legalistic framework but as means to rekindle ethnic cohesion. His approach echoed popular sentiment in the East Coast. So did Solomon Freehof, son to immigrants from Chernihiv, who advocated a selective rapprochement with &quot;halakha&quot;, which was to offer &quot;guidance, not governance&quot;; Freehof advocated replacing the sterile mood of community life, allowing isolated practices to emerge spontaneously and reincorporating old ones. He redrafted the Union Prayer Book in 1940 to include more old formulae and authored many responsa, though he always stressed compliance was voluntary.

Cohon and Freehof rose against the background of the Great Depression, when many congregations teetered on the threshold of collapse. Growing Antisemitism in Europe led German Liberals on similar paths. Rabbis Leo Baeck, Max Dienemann and Seligmann himself turned to stressing Jewish peoplehood and tradition. The Nazis&#x27; takeover in 1933 effected a religious revival in communities long plagued by apathy and assimilation. The great changes convinced the CCAR to adopt a new set of principles. On 29 May 1937, in Columbus, Ohio, a &quot;Declaration of Principles&quot; (eschewing the more formal, binding &quot;platform&quot;), promoted a greater degree of ritual observance, supported Zionism – considered by the Classicists in the past as, at best, a remedy for the unemancipated Jewish masses in Russia and Romania, while they did not regard the Jews as a nation in the modern sense – and opened not with theology, but by the statement, &quot;Judaism is the historical religious experience of the Jewish people&quot;. The Columbus Principles signified the transformation from &quot;Classical&quot; to the &quot;New Reform Judaism&quot;, characterized by a lesser focus on abstract concepts and a more positive attitude to practice and traditional elements.

The Holocaust and the establishment of the State of Israel reinforced the tendency. The Americanization and move to the suburbs in the 1950s facilitated a double effect: the secular Jewish ideologies of the immigrants&#x27; generation, like Bundism or Labour Zionism, became anachronistic. Military service exposed recruits to the family-oriented, moderate religiosity of middle-class America. Many sought an affiliation in the early years of the Cold War, when lack of such raised suspicion of leftist or communist sympathies. The &quot;Return to Tradition&quot;, as it was termed, smoothed the path for many such into UAHC. It grew from 290 communities with 50,000 affiliated households in 1937 to 560 with 255,000 in 1956. A similar shift to nostalgic traditionalism was expressed overseas. Even the purist Liberals in Britain introduced minor customs that bore sentimental value; Bar Mitzvah replaced confirmation.

World War II shattered many of the assumptions about human progress and benevolence held by liberal denominations, Reform included. A new generation of theologians attempted to formulate a response. Thinkers such as Eugene Borowitz and J.J. Petuchowski turned mainly to existentialism, portraying humans in a fragile, complex relationship with the divine. While religious humanism was ever-present, it remained confined to a small group, and official positions retained a theistic approach. But the main focus in American Reform lay elsewhere: in 1946, Rabbi Maurice Eisendrath was appointed President of the UAHC. He turned the notion of Tikkun Olam, &quot;repairing of the world&quot;, into the practical expression of affiliation, leading involvement in the civil rights movement, Vietnam War opposition and other progressive causes. In 1954, the first permanent Reform congregation was established in the State of Israel, again at Jerusalem. The Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism was registered in 1971, and the worldwide movement moved the WUPJ&#x27;s headquarters to Jerusalem in 1974, signalling its growing attachment to Zionism.

The 1960s and 70s saw the rise of multiculturalism and the weakening of organized religion in favour of personal spirituality. A growing &quot;return to ethnicity&quot; among the young made items such as prayer shawls fashionable again. In 1963, HUC-graduate Sherwin Wine seceded to form the openly atheistic Birmingham Temple, declaring that for him Judaism was a cultural tradition, not a faith. Knowing that many in their audience held quite overlapping ideas, the pressure on the CCAR to move toward nontheism grew.

In 1975, the lack of consensus surfaced during the compilation of a new standard prayer book, &quot;Gates of Prayer&quot;. To accommodate all, ten liturgies for morning service and six for the evening were offered for each congregation to choose of, from very traditional to one that retained the Hebrew text for God but translated it as &quot;Eternal Power&quot;, condemned by many as de facto humanistic. &quot;Gates of Prayer&quot; symbolized the movement&#x27;s adoption of what would be termed &quot;Big Tent Judaism&quot;, welcoming all, over theological clarity. In the following year, an attempt to draft a new platform for the CCAR in San Francisco ended with poor results. Led by Borowitz, any notion of issuing guidelines was abandoned in favour of a &quot;Centenary Perspective&quot; with few coherent statements. The &quot;Big Tent&quot;, while taking its toll on the theoreticians, did substantially bolster constituency. The UAHC slowly caught up with Conservative Judaism on the path toward becoming the largest American denomination. Yet it did not erase boundaries completely and rejected outright those who held syncretic beliefs like Jewbu and Messianic Judaism, and also Sherwin Wine-style Secular Humanistic Judaism. Congregation Beth Adam, which excised all references to God from its liturgy, was denied UAHC membership by a landslide vote of 113:15 in 1994.

In 1972, the first Reform female rabbi, Sally Priesand, was ordained at HUC. In 1977, the CCAR declared that the biblical ban on male same-sex intercourse referred only to the pagan customs prevalent at the time it was composed, and gradually accepted openly LGBT constituents and clergy. The first LGBT rabbi, Stacy Offner, was instated in 1988, and full equality was declared in 1990. Same-sex marriage guidelines were published in 1997. In 1978, UAHC President Alexander Schindler admitted that measures aimed at curbing intermarriage rates by various sanctions, whether on the concerned parties or on rabbis assisting or acknowledging them (ordinances penalizing such involvement were passed in 1909, 1947 and 1962), were no longer effective. He called for a policy of outreach and tolerance, rejecting &quot;intermarriage, but not the intermarried&quot;, hoping to convince gentile spouses to convert. In 1983, the CCAR accepted patrilineal descent, a step taken by British Liberals already in the 1950s. UAHC membership grew by 23% in 1975–1985, to 1.3 million. An estimated 10,000 intermarried couples were joining annually.

On 26 May 1999, after a prolonged debate and six widely different drafts rejected, a &quot;Statement of Principles for Reform Judaism&quot; was adopted in Pittsburgh by the Central Conference of American Rabbis. It affirmed the &quot;reality and oneness of God&quot;, the Torah as &quot;God&#x27;s ongoing revelation to our people&quot; and committed to the &quot;ongoing study of the whole array of Commandments and to the fulfillment of those that address us as individuals and as a community. Some of these sacred obligations have long been observed by Reform Jews; others, both ancient and modern, demand renewed attention.&quot; While the wording was carefully crafted in order not to displease the estimated 20%–25% of membership that retained Classicist persuasions, it did raise condemnation from many of them. In 2008, the Society for Classical Reform Judaism was founded to mobilize and coordinate those who preferred the old universalist, ethics-based and less-observant religious style, with its unique aesthetic components. SCRJ leader, Rabbi Howard A. Berman, claimed that the neo-traditional approach, adopted by the URJ, alienated more congregants than those it drew in.

<text>Reconstructionist Judaism () is a Jewish movement based on the concepts developed by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan (1881–1983) that views Judaism as a progressively evolving civilization rather than just a religion. The movement originated as a semi-organized stream within Conservative Judaism, developed between the late 1920s and the 1940s before seceding in 1955, and established a rabbinical college in 1967. Reconstructionist Judaism is recognized by many scholars as one of the five major streams of Judaism in America alongside Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Humanistic.

There is substantial theological diversity within the movement. &quot;Halakha&quot; (Jewish law) is not considered normative and binding but is instead seen as the basis for the ongoing evolution of meaningful Jewish practice. In contrast with the Reform movement&#x27;s stance during the time he was writing, Kaplan believed that &quot;Jewish life [is] meaningless without Jewish law&quot; and one of the planks he wrote for the proto-Reconstructionist Society for the Jewish Renaissance stated, &quot;We accept the &quot;halakha&quot;, which is rooted in the Talmud, as the norm of Jewish life, availing ourselves, at the same time, of the method implicit therein to interpret and develop the body of Jewish Law by the actual conditions and spiritual needs of modern life.&quot; The movement also emphasizes positive views toward modernity and has an approach to Jewish customs that aims toward communal decision-making through a process of education and distillation of values from traditional Jewish sources.

The movement&#x27;s 2011 &quot;A Guide to Jewish Practice&quot; describes a Reconstructionist approach to Jewish practice as &quot;post-&quot;halakhic&quot;&quot; because the modern world is one in which Jewish law cannot be enforced. Obligation and spiritual discipline exist without the enforcement of a functioning legal system. Thus, Reconstructionist Jews take Jewish law seriously as a source and resource that can shape expectations while not necessarily seeing themselves as bound by inherited claims of obligation. Therefore, the practices in the guide are not monolithic, and commentators provide further insights, arguments, and alternative approaches that span the broad range of views that Reconstructionist rabbis and scholars advocate. The guide states that it &quot;assumes that thoughtful individuals and committed communities can handle diversity and will of necessity reach their own conclusions.&quot;

==Origin==

Reconstructionism was developed by Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan (1881–1983) and his son-in-law, Rabbi Ira Eisenstein (1906–2001), over a period of time from the late 1920s to the 1940s. After being rejected by Orthodox rabbis for his focus on issues in the community and the sociopolitical environment, Kaplan and a group of followers founded the Society for the Advancement of Judaism (SAJ) in 1922. Its goal was to give rabbis the opportunity to form new outlooks on Judaism in a more progressive manner. Kaplan was the leader of the SAJ until Eisenstein succeeded him in 1945. In 1935, Kaplan published his book, &quot;Judaism as a Civilization: Toward a Reconstruction of American Jewish Life&quot;. It was this book that Kaplan claimed was the beginning of the Reconstructionist movement. &quot;Judaism as a Civilization&quot; suggested that historical Judaism be given a &quot;revaluation... in terms of present-day thought.&quot; Reconstructionism was able to spread with several other forms of literature—most notably, the &quot;New Haggadah&quot; (1941), which for the first time blended Kaplan&#x27;s ideologies in Jewish ceremonial literature.

Although Kaplan did not want Reconstructionism to branch into another Jewish denomination, it became apparent that such an outcome was inevitable. At the Montreal conference in 1967, Reconstructionist leaders called for a rabbinical school in which rabbis could be ordained under the Reconstructionist ideology and lead Reconstructionist congregations. By the fall of 1968, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College was opened in Philadelphia. Along with the establishment of the college, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association formed, which gave rabbis a strong network in the religious leadership of Reconstructionism. The founding of these institutions were great strides in its becoming the fourth movement in North American Judaism (Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform being the other three).

Reconstructionist Judaism is the first major movement of Judaism to originate in North America; the second is the Humanistic Judaism movement founded in 1963 by Rabbi Sherwin Wine.

==Theology==
Kaplan believed that, in light of advances in philosophy, science, and history, it would be impossible for modern Jews to continue to adhere to many of Judaism&#x27;s traditional theological claims. Kaplan affirmed that God is not anthropomorphic in any way, a position articulated by prominent medieval Jewish thinkers like Maimonides and in agreement with the rest of Rabbinic Judaism. All anthropomorphic descriptions of God are understood to be metaphorical.

Kaplan&#x27;s theology went further to claim that God is neither a personal nor conscious being; God cannot relate to or communicate with humanity in any way. Kaplan&#x27;s theology defines God as the sum of all natural processes that allow people to become self-fulfilled.
Most &quot;classical&quot; Reconstructionist Jews (i.e., those agreeing with Kaplan) reject traditional forms of theism, though this is by no means universal. Many Reconstructionist Jews are deists, but the movement also includes Jews who hold Kabbalistic, pantheistic, personal, and/or panentheistic views of God.

Kaplan&#x27;s theology, as he explicitly stated, does not represent the only Reconstructionist understanding of theology and theology is not the cornerstone of the Reconstructionist movement. Much more central is the idea that Judaism is a civilization, and that the Jewish people must take an active role in ensuring its future by participating in its ongoing evolution.

Consequently, a strain of Reconstructionism exists which is distinctly non-Kaplanian. In this view, Kaplan&#x27;s assertions concerning belief and practice are largely rejected, while the tenets of an &quot;evolving religious civilization&quot; are supported. The basis for this approach is that Kaplan spoke for his generation; he also wrote that every generation would need to define itself and its civilization for itself. In the thinking of these Reconstructionists, what Kaplan said concerning belief and practice is not applicable today. This approach may include a belief in a personal God, acceptance of the concept of &quot;chosenness&quot;, a belief in some form of resurrection or continued existence of the dead, and the existence of an obligatory form of &quot;halakha&quot;. In the latter, in particular, there has developed a broader concept of &quot;halakha&quot; wherein concepts such as &quot;Eco-Kashrut&quot; are incorporated.

==Jewish law and tradition==
Reconstructionist Judaism holds that the traditional halakhic system is incapable of producing a code of conduct that is meaningful for, and acceptable to, the vast majority of contemporary Jews, and thus must be reinterpreted in each new time period. Unlike classical Reform Judaism, Reconstructionism holds that a person&#x27;s default position should be to incorporate Jewish laws and tradition into their lives, unless they have a specific reason to do otherwise. However some Reconstructionists believe that halakha is neither normative, nor binding, but are general guidelines.

Reconstructionism promotes many traditional Jewish practices. Thus, the commandments have been replaced with &quot;folkways&quot;, non-binding customs that can be democratically accepted or rejected by the congregations. Folkways that are promoted include keeping Hebrew in the prayer service, studying Torah, daily prayer, wearing &quot;kippot&quot; (&quot;yarmulkes&quot;), &quot;tallitot&quot; and &quot;tefillin&quot; during prayer, and observance of the Jewish holidays.

Reconstructionists may use distinct prayer books, such as the &quot;Kol haneshamah&quot; Hebrew/English Reconstructionist prayer book. Marc Shapiro called attention to the Reconstructionist &quot;Kol haneshamah&quot; taking liberties with the text, sometimes with an English translation &quot;so blatantly inaccurate that we have no choice but to regard it as a conscious alteration.&quot;

==Beliefs==
In practice, Kaplan&#x27;s books, especially &quot;The Meaning of God in Modern Jewish Religion&quot; and &quot;Judaism as a Civilization&quot; are &quot;de facto&quot; statements of principles. In 1986, the Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association (RRA) and the Federation of Reconstructionist Congregations and Havurot (FRCH) passed the official &quot;Platform on Reconstructionism&quot;. It is not a mandatory statement of principles, but rather a consensus of current beliefs. Major points of the platform state that:

Most Reconstructionists do not believe in revelation (the idea that God reveals his will to human beings). This is dismissed as supernaturalism. Kaplan posits that revelation &quot;consists in disengaging from the traditional context those elements in it which answer permanent postulates of human nature, and in integrating them into our own ideology...the rest may be relegated to archaeology&quot;.

Many writers have criticized the movement&#x27;s most widely held theology, religious naturalism. David Ray Griffin and Louis Jacobs have objected to the redefinitions of the terms &quot;revelation&quot; and &quot;God&quot; as being intellectually dishonest, and as being a form of &quot;conversion by definition&quot;; in their critique, these redefinitions take non-theistic beliefs and attach theistic terms to them. Similar critiques have been put forth by Rabbis Neil Gillman, Milton Steinberg, and Michael Samuels.

Reconstructionist Judaism is egalitarian with respect to gender roles. All positions are open to all genders; they are open to lesbians, gay men, and transgender individuals as well.

==Jewish identity==
Reconstructionist Judaism allows its rabbis to determine their own policy regarding officiating at intermarriages. Some congregations accept patrilineal as well as matrilineal descent, and children of one Jewish parent, of any gender, are considered Jewish by birth if raised as Jews. This contrasts with the traditional interpretations of Jewish law of both Rabbinical Judaism, in which a child is Jewish by birth if its mother was Jewish; and of Karaite Judaism, in which a child is Jewish by birth if its &quot;father&quot; was Jewish.

The role of non-Jews in Reconstructionist congregations is a matter of ongoing debate. Practices vary between synagogues. Most congregations strive to strike a balance between inclusivity and integrity of boundaries. The Jewish Reconstructionist Federation (JRF) has issued a non-binding statement attempting to delineate the process by which congregations set policy on these issues, and sets forth sample recommendations. These issues are ultimately decided by local lay leadership.

In 2015 the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College voted to accept rabbinical students in interfaith relationships, making Reconstructionist Judaism the first type of Judaism to officially allow rabbis in relationships with non-Jewish partners. In making the decision, the movement considered that &quot;many younger progressive Jews, including many rabbis and rabbinical students, now perceive restrictions placed on those who are intermarried as reinforcing a tribalism that feels personally alienating and morally troubling in the 21st century.&quot; In April 2016 nineteen Reconstructionist rabbis announced the formation of Beit Kaplan: The Rabbinic Partnership for Jewish Peoplehood, in part to protest the decision to allow rabbis to have non-Jewish partners.

Although the Reconstructionist movement officially supports liberal Zionism, it also has a disproportionate amount of anti-Zionist members. Of the Jewish Voice for Peace rabbinical council, about 60 percent of their members were trained at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College.

==Organizations==

Over 100 synagogues and &quot;havurot&quot;, mostly in the United States and Canada, were affiliated with the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation. As of June 3, 2012, the Reconstructionist movement has been restructured. A joint institution consisting of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College (RRC) and the congregational organization is now the primary organization of the movement. 

The movement&#x27;s new designation was first &quot;Jewish Reconstructionist Communities,&quot; and in 2018 became Reconstructing Judaism. Rabbi Deborah Waxman was inaugurated as the president of the RRC and Jewish Reconstructionist Communities on October 26, 2014. As the president of the RRC, she is believed to be the first woman and first lesbian to lead a Jewish congregational union, and the first lesbian to lead a Jewish seminary; the RRC is both a congregational union and a seminary. Waxman is a 1999 graduate of RRC.

The RRC educates rabbis. The Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association is the professional organization of Reconstructionist rabbis. The Jewish Reconstructionist youth organization is named No&#x27;ar Hadash. Camp Havaya (formerly Camp JRF) in South Sterling, Pennsylvania, is the Reconstructionist movement&#x27;s summer sleep away camp.

In April 2016, a new Reconstructionist rabbinical organization was formed: Beit Kaplan: The Rabbinic Partnership for Jewish Peoplehood. Originally, Beit Kaplan was focused upon opposing both the decision to allow Reconstructionist rabbis to have non-Jewish partners, and the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement within Reconstructionist circles. Following the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, Beit Kaplan&#x27;s membership increased to 72 rabbis and rabbinical students in six countries. Presently, Beit Kaplan focuses on a &quot;course correction&quot; to reestablish the Reconstructionist movement&#x27;s support for Israel and emphasis on the centrality of Jewish peoplehood.

According to the 2010 US Religion Census, there were 41,436 members of Reconstructionist Judaism within 95 synagogues.

As of 2020, the Pew Research Center estimated that Reconstructionist Judaism, along with Humanistic Judaism and other smaller denominations, constituted 4% of the United States&#x27;s 7.5 million Jews.

==Relation to other Jewish movements==
Originally an offshoot of Conservative Judaism, Reconstructionism retains warm relations with Reform Judaism; however, Orthodox Judaism considers Reconstructionism, and every other non-Orthodox denomination, to be in violation of proper observance of interpretation of Jewish law. The Jewish Reconstructionist Federation is a member of the World Union for Progressive Judaism, in which it gained an observer status in 1990.

<text>Rupert Parkes (born 6 September 1971), known as Photek, is a Los Angeles-based British electronic music DJ/record producer, and TV and film score composer. Photek was born and raised in Ipswich, Suffolk, England.

Photek has contributed music to several film, TV and video game productions, such as &quot;Blade&quot; in 1998. He also scored the show &quot;Gang Related&quot; with director Allen Hughes.

He received three consecutive Grammy Award nominations in the category of Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical for Daft Punk&#x27;s &quot;End of Line&quot; from the &quot;&quot; in 2012, Moby&#x27;s &quot;Lie Down in Darkness&quot; in 2013 and One Love/People Get Ready&quot; in 2014.

Photek composed the TV score for the show &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot;.

==Biography==
===Education===
Initially interested in hip hop, Parkes expanded his style with elements of soul and jazz. His first instrument was a tenor saxophone, but when a piano arrived in the family home his focus shifted to composition as opposed to performance. By 1992, he had switched from the saxophone to a sequencer. Within the next year he started to perform under the stage name Photek.

===Early career 1993–1999===
Parkes began his first forays into releasing music in 1993 under a plethora of different names. Some of the early releases include the jungle-styled tracks &quot;Jump&quot; under the name Studio Pressure on Certificate 18, &#x27;Dolphin Tune&#x27; under the name Aquarius on LTJ Bukem&#x27;s Good Looking Records and &#x27;Pulse Of Life&#x27; under the name The Sentinel on Basement Records. The first release under the Photek production name came in 1994 with &quot;Touching Down... Planet Photek&quot;, released on his own Photek label. Photek&#x27;s breakthrough release in 1995 was the &quot;Natural Born Killa&quot; drum&#x27;n&#x27;bass EP for Goldie&#x27;s Metalheadz. In 1996, Photek contributed one track on the &quot;Wipeout 2097&quot;/&quot;Wipeout&quot; XL soundtracks.

Photek&#x27;s debut album was &quot;Modus Operandi&quot; in 1997, through Virgin Records. In 1997, Virgin Records released Photek&#x27;s &quot;Ni Ten Ichi Ryu&quot;. A year later, Photek released his second album &quot;Form &amp; Function&quot;. The album comprised four tracks that had previously only been available on limited release vinyl in the early 1990s, plus six remixes and versions by Photek himself as well as other contemporaries Digital, Peshay &amp; Decoder, Doc Scott, and J Majik.

===2000–2012===
In 2000, Photek released his &quot;Solaris&quot; album, turning his attention from drum and bass to Chicago house and minimal techno. On the single &quot;Mine to Give&quot;, he cooperated with Robert Owens to create a No. 1 &quot;Billboard&quot; single.

&quot;One Nation&quot; – the dubplate that had been available as a white label record for over a decade, saw an official release on &quot;Form &amp; Function Vol. 2&quot;. The newer productions on the album showed Photek using a broader sound palette, taking influence from his composition and soundtrack work by including orchestrated passages. There are references to a more rock and industrial sound.

After a four-year hiatus from releasing music under the Photek moniker, Parkes produced a series of EPs in 2011. He was invited to contribute to BBC Radio 1&#x27;s &#x27;Essential Mix&#x27; series in October 2012. In the same year, Parkes released the album &quot;KU:PALM&quot;.

===Grammy nominations===
Photek&#x27;s remix of Daft Punk&#x27;s &quot;End of Line&quot; for the Disney movie &quot;&quot; earned him a Grammy nomination for Best Remix in 2012. He received Grammy nominations in the same category for the following 2 years, with remixes for Moby and Bob Marley.

===Recent activities===
Now based in Los Angeles, Photek scored the second season of ABC&#x27;s &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot; in fall of 2015, and continued recording of the follow-up to &quot;KU:PALM&quot; and various movie and computer game scoring projects. More recently in 2023, he composed the Season 5 Music for Call of Duty Modern Warfare II.

==Remixes==
Photek has remixed many artists in his career such as David Bowie, Björk and Goldie. Additional production work on the Nine Inch Nails album &quot;With Teeth&quot; led to his remix of their track, &quot;The Hand That Feeds&quot;, which got him KROQ daytime rotation.

<doc id="26040" wikidata="Q748157" url="?curid=26040" title="Homosexuality and religion">
<text>The relationship between religion and homosexuality has varied greatly across time and place, within and between different religions and denominations, with regard to different forms of homosexuality and bisexuality. The present-day doctrines of the world&#x27;s major religions and their denominations differ in their attitudes toward these sexual orientations. Adherence to anti-gay religious beliefs and communities is correlated with the prevalence of emotional distress and suicidality in sexual minority individuals, and is a primary motivation for seeking conversion therapy.

Among the religious denominations which generally reject these orientations, there are many different types of opposition, ranging from quietly discouraging homosexual activity, explicitly forbidding same-sex sexual practices among their adherents and actively opposing social acceptance of homosexuality, supporting criminal sanctions up to capital punishment, and even to condoning extrajudicial killings. Religious fundamentalism often correlates with anti-homosexual bias. Psychological research has connected religiosity with homophobic attitudes and physical antigay hostility, and has traced religious opposition to gay adoption to collectivistic values (loyalty, authority, purity) and low flexibility in existential issues, rather than to high prosocial inclinations for the weak. Attitudes toward homosexuality have been found to be determined not only by personal religious beliefs, but by the interaction of those beliefs with the predominant national religious context—even for people who are less religious or who do not share their local dominant religious context. Many argue that it is homosexual actions which are sinful, rather than same-sex attraction itself. To this end, some discourage labeling individuals according to sexual orientation. Several organizations assert that conversion therapy can help diminish same-sex attraction.

Some adherents of many religions view homosexuality and bisexuality positively, and some denominations routinely bless same-sex marriages and support LGBT rights, a growing trend as much of the developed world enacts laws supporting LGBT rights.

Historically, some cultures and religions accommodated, institutionalized, or revered same-sex love and sexuality; such mythologies and traditions can be found around the world. While Hinduism does not condemn homosexuality exclusively, it does often have a negative view on sexual activity generally (especially for the upper class of monks and priests), and one can find numerous portrayals of homosexuality in Hindu literature and artworks. Also there is an important point to note that Hindus have a god or a symbol called Hari Hara which resembles both men and women. i.e Half man and half woman. Sikh wedding ceremonies are non-gender specific, and so same-sex marriage is possible within Sikhism.

Regardless of their position on homosexuality, many people of faith look to both sacred texts and tradition for guidance on this issue. However, the authority of various traditions or scriptural passages and the correctness of translations and interpretations are continually disputed.

==Specific religious groups==
=== Ancient Mesopotamian religion ===
Individuals who went against the traditional gender binary were heavily involved in the cult of Inanna, an ancient Mesopotamian goddess. During Sumerian times, a set of priests known as &quot;gala&quot; worked in Inanna&#x27;s temples, where they performed elegies and lamentations. Men who became &quot;gala&quot; sometimes adopted female names and their songs were composed in the Sumerian &quot;eme-sal&quot; dialect, which, in literary texts, is normally reserved for the speech of female characters. Some Sumerian proverbs seem to suggest that &quot;gala&quot; had a reputation for engaging in anal sex with men. During the Akkadian Period, &quot;kurgarrū&quot; and &quot;assinnu&quot; were servants of Ishtar who dressed in female clothing and performed war dances in Ishtar&#x27;s temples. Several Akkadian proverbs seem to suggest that they may have also had homosexual proclivities. Gwendolyn Leick, an anthropologist known for her writings on Mesopotamia, has compared these individuals to the contemporary Indian &quot;hijra.&quot; In one Akkadian hymn, Ishtar is described as transforming men into women. Some modern pagans include Inanna in their worship.

=== Abrahamic religions ===
The Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, have traditionally forbidden sodomy, believing and teaching that such behavior is sinful. Today some denominations within these religions are accepting of homosexuality and inclusive of homosexual people, such as Reform Judaism, the United Church of Christ and the Metropolitan Community Church. Some Presbyterian, Anglican, Lutheran, and Methodist churches welcome members regardless of same-sex sexual practices, with some provinces allowing for the ordination and inclusion of gay and lesbian clerics, and affirmation of same-sex unions. Reform Judaism incorporates lesbian and gay rabbis and same-sex marriage liturgies, while Reconstructionist Judaism and Conservative Judaism in the US allows for lesbian and gay rabbis and same-sex unions.

====Judaism====

The Torah (first five books of the Hebrew Bible) is the primary source for Jewish views on homosexuality. It states that: &quot;[A man] shall not lie with another man as [he would] with a woman, it is (, &quot;abomination&quot;)&quot; (Leviticus 18:22). (Like many similar commandments, the stated punishment for willful violation is the death penalty, although in practice rabbinic Judaism no longer believes it has the authority to implement death penalties.)

Orthodox Judaism views homosexual acts as sinful. In recent years, there have been approaches claiming that only the sexual anal act is forbidden and considered an abomination by the Torah, while sexual orientation and even other sexual activities are not considered a sin. Conservative Judaism has engaged in an in-depth study of homosexuality since the 1990s, with various rabbis presenting a wide array of responsa (papers with legal arguments) for communal consideration. The official position of the movement is to welcome homosexual Jews into their synagogues, and also campaign against any discrimination in civil law and public society, but also to uphold a ban on anal sex as a religious requirement.

Reform Judaism and Reconstructionist Judaism in North America and Liberal Judaism in the United Kingdom view homosexuality to be acceptable on the same basis as heterosexuality. Progressive Jewish authorities believe either that traditional laws against homosexuality are no longer binding or that they are subject to changes that reflect a new understanding of human sexuality. Some of these authorities rely on modern biblical scholarship suggesting that the prohibition in the Torah was intended to ban coercive or ritualized male-male sex, such as those practices ascribed to Egyptian and Canaanite fertility cults and temple prostitution.

====Christianity====

The Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and its traditional interpretations in Judaism and Christianity have historically affirmed and endorsed a patriarchal and heteronormative approach towards human sexuality, favouring exclusively penetrative vaginal intercourse between men and women within the boundaries of marriage over all other forms of human sexual activity, including autoeroticism, masturbation, oral sex, non-penetrative and non-heterosexual sexual intercourse (all of which have been labeled as &quot;sodomy&quot; at various times), believing and teaching that such behaviors are forbidden because they are considered sinful, and further compared to or derived from the behavior of the alleged residents of Sodom and Gomorrah.

Christian denominations hold a variety of views on homosexual sex, ranging from outright condemnation to complete acceptance. Throughout the majority of Christian history, most Christian theologians and denominations have considered homosexual sex as immoral or sinful. Most Christian denominations welcome people attracted to the same sex, but teach that homosexual sex is sinful. These denominations include the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox church, the Oriental Orthodox churches, Confessional Lutheran denominations such as the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, and some other mainline denominations, such as the Reformed Church in America and the American Baptist Church, as well as Conservative Evangelical organizations and churches, such as the Evangelical Alliance, and fundamentalist groups and churches, such as the Southern Baptist Convention. Pentecostal churches such as the Assemblies of God, as well as Restorationist churches, like Iglesia ni Cristo, the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also take the position that homosexual sexual activity is sinful.

Liberal Christians are generally supportive of homosexuals. Some Christian denominations do not view monogamous same sex relationships as bad or evil. These include the United Church of Canada, the United Church of Christ, the Episcopal Church, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the churches of the Old Catholic Union of Utrecht, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada, the Church of Sweden, the Lutheran, reformed and united churches in Evangelical Church of Germany, the Church of Denmark, the Icelandic Church, the Church of Norway and the Protestant Church of the Netherlands. In particular, the Metropolitan Community Church, a denomination of 40,000 members, was founded specifically to serve the Christian LGBT community, and is devoted to being open and affirming to LGBTQ people. The United Church of Christ, the United Methodist Church (UMC) and the Alliance of Baptists also condone gay marriage, and some parts of the Anglican and Lutheran churches allow for the blessing of gay unions. Within the Anglican communion there are openly gay clergy; for example, Gene Robinson and Mary Glasspool are openly homosexual bishops in the US Episcopal Church and Eva Brunne in Lutheran Church of Sweden. The Episcopal Church&#x27;s recent actions vis-a-vis homosexuality have brought about increased ethical debate and tension within the Church of England and worldwide Anglican churches. In the United States and many other nations, the religious people are becoming more affirming of same-sex relationships. Even those in denominations with official stances are liberalizing, though not as quickly as those in more affirming religious groups. 

Passages from the Mosaic Covenant and its broader Old Testament context have been interpreted to mean that anyone who is engaging in homosexual practices should be punished with death (Leviticus 20:13; cf. Genesis 19:4–25; Judges 19:22–20:48; 2 Peter 2:6–10; Jude 7). HIV/AIDS has also been portrayed by some Christian fundamentalists such as Fred Phelps and Jerry Falwell as a punishment by God against homosexuals. In the 20th century, theologians like Karl Barth, Jürgen Moltmann, Hans Küng, John Robinson, Bishop David Jenkins, Don Cupitt, and Bishop Jack Spong challenged traditional theological positions and understandings of the Bible; following these developments some have suggested that passages have been mistranslated, are taken out of context, or that they do not refer to what is generally understood as &quot;homosexuality.&quot;

Conservative denominations generally oppose same-sex sexual relations based on Old Testament and New Testament texts that describe human sexual relations as strictly heterosexual by God&#x27;s design. As such, it is argued that sexual desires and actions that contradict God&#x27;s design are deemed sinful and are condemned by God (e.g. Leviticus 18:22; cf. Leviticus 20:13). Since love does not rejoice in unrighteousness or iniquity (cf. 1 Corinthians 13:6), and since homosexual desires and actions are believed to remain contrary to God&#x27;s design and condemned by God as sinful/iniquity (e.g. &quot;in general&quot;, Romans 126–27; &quot;passively&quot;, 1 Corinthians 6:96:9; &quot;actively&quot;, including but not limited to &quot;pederasty,&quot; 1 Corinthians 6:9; 1 Timothy 1:9-11; considered sexually &quot;immoral&quot;, Galatians 5:19-21; Colossians 3:5-7; Ephesians 5:3), adherents of conservative denominations believe that genuine love for God and humanity is best expressed by following God rather than the world (Acts 5:29; cf. Jeremiah 23:1-40; Romans 12:9).

While the Catholic view is founded on a natural law argument informed by scripture and proposed by Thomas Aquinas, the traditional conservative Protestant view is based on an interpretation of scripture alone. Protestant conservatives also see homosexual relationships as an impediment to heterosexual relationships. They interpret some Biblical passages to be commandments to be heterosexually married. Catholics, on the other hand, have accommodated unmarried people as priests, monks, nuns and single lay people for over 1,000 years. A number of self-described gay and &#x27;ex-gay&#x27; Christians have reported satisfaction in mixed-orientation marriages.

=====Catholic Church=====

The Catholic Church teaches that those who are attracted to persons of the same sex are called to practice chastity, just like everyone else has to before they get married. The Catholic Church does not regard homosexual activity as an expression of the marital sacrament, which it teaches is only possible within a lifelong commitment of a marriage between a man and a woman. According to the Church&#x27;s sexual ethics, homosexual activity falls short in the complementarity (male and female organs complement each other) and fecundity (openness to new life) of the sexual act. Few studies of parishioners&#x27; individual views are sometimes at variance with the church&#x27;s non-acceptance of homosexuality.

All homosexual or same-sex sexual activity is forbidden by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in its law of chastity, and the church teaches that God does not approve of same-sex marriage and may punish same-sex sexual behavior with a disciplinary council. Members of the church who experience homosexual attractions, including those who self-identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual remain in good standing in the church if they abstain from same-sex marriage and all sexual relations outside an opposite-sex marriage, but all, including those participating in same-sex activity and relationships, are allowed to attend weekly church worship services. However, in order to receive church ordinances such as baptism, and to enter church temples, adherents are required to abstain from same-sex relations. Additionally, in the church&#x27;s plan of salvation noncelibate gay and lesbian individuals will not be allowed in the top tier of heaven to receive exaltation unless they repent, and a heterosexual marriage is a requirement for exaltation.

The LDS Church previously taught that homosexuality was a curable condition and counseled members that they could and should change their attractions and provided therapy and programs with that goal. From 1976 until 1989 the Church Handbook called for church discipline for members attracted to the same sex equating merely being homosexual with the seriousness of acts of adultery and child molestation—even celibate gay people were subject to excommunication. Church publications now state that &quot;individuals do not choose to have such attractions&quot;, its church-run therapy services no longer provides sexual orientation change efforts, and the church has no official stance on the causes of homosexuality. These current teachings and policies leave homosexual members with the options of entering a mixed-orientation opposite-sex marriage, or living a celibate lifestyle without any sexual expression (including masturbation).

====Islam====


Classical Islamic jurists did not deal with homosexuality as a sexual orientation, since the latter concept is modern and has no equivalent in traditional law, which dealt with it under the technical terms of &quot;liwata&quot; and &quot;zinā&quot;. Most legal schools treat homosexual intercourse with penetration similarly to unlawful heterosexual intercourse under the rubric of &quot;zinā&quot;, but there are differences of opinion with respect to methods of punishment, as evident from an eleventh-century discussion among the scholars of Baghdad. Some gay individuals undergo sex reassignment surgery to transition into the opposite gender to legally marry.

The discourse on homosexuality in Islam is primarily concerned with activities between men. There are, however, a few hadiths that mention homosexual behavior among women. Although punishment for lesbianism is rarely mentioned in the histories, al-Tabari records an example of the execution in the year 170 AH (786 or 787 AD) of a pair of lesbian slavegirls in the harem of al-Hadi in a collection of highly critical anecdotes pertaining to that Caliph&#x27;s actions as ruler.

Some jurists viewed sexual intercourse as possible only for an individual who possesses a phallus, hence those definitions of sexual intercourse that rely on the entry of as little as the corona of the phallus into a partner&#x27;s orifice. Since women do not possess a phallus and, in this interpretation, cannot have intercourse with one another, they are therefore physically incapable of committing &quot;zinā&quot;.

====Bahá&#x27;í Faith====
The Baháʼí Faith considers same-sex sexual behavior and same-sex marriage to be against God&#x27;s will. Sex is only permitted in a marriage between a man and a woman for Baháʼís. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual members who engage in any same-sex sexual behavior are subject to sanctions from the Baha’i administration, including being excluded from community gatherings and denied participation in organizational elections. Baháʼís have been discouraged from both promoting or opposing efforts to legalize same-sex marriage.

===Indian religions===
Among the religions that originated in ancient and medieval India, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism, teachings regarding homosexuality are less clear than among the Abrahamic traditions, and religious authorities voice diverse opinions. Sikhism has no specific teachings about homosexuality and the Sikh holy scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib, does not explicitly mention heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality. The universal goal of a Sikh is to have no hate or animosity to any person, regardless of factors like race, caste, color, creed or gender. Hinduism is diverse, with no supreme governing body, but the majority of swamis opposed same-sex relationships in a 2004 survey, and a minority supported them. Ancient religious texts such as the Vedas do not restrict homosexuality and often refer to people of a third gender, who are neither female nor male. Some see this third gender as an ancient parallel to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex identities.

==== Hinduism ====

Hinduism does not have a central authority. Many Hindu sects have taken various positions on homosexuality, ranging from positive to neutral or antagonistic. Referring to the nature of Samsara, the Rigveda, one of the four canonical sacred texts of Hinduism says &#x27;Vikruti Evam Prakriti&#x27; (&quot;Perversity/diversity is what nature is all about&quot;, or, &quot;What seems unnatural is also natural&quot;). A &quot;third gender&quot; has been acknowledged within numerous Hindu texts. Several Hindu texts, such as Manu Smriti and Sushruta Samhita, assert that some people are born with either mixed male and female natures, or sexually neuter, as a matter of natural biology (while at the same time there are examples of speaking negatively in regards to male homosexuality as shown by the Manu Smriti and Arthashastra). In addition, each Hindu denomination had developed distinct rules regarding sexuality, as Hinduism is not unified and is decentralized in essence.

Hindu groups are historically not unified regarding the issue of homosexuality, each one having a distinct doctrinal view.

The Indian Kama Sutra, written around 150 BC, contains passages describing eunuchs or &quot;third-sex&quot; males performing oral sex on men. The text describes Kama as one of the three objectives to be achieved in life. Though it forbids the educated Brahmins, bureaucrats and wisemen from practicing Auparishtaka (oral sex).

Similarly, some medieval Hindu temples and artifacts openly depict both male homosexuality and lesbianism within their carvings, such as the temple walls at Khajuraho. Some infer from these images that at least part of the Hindu society and religion were previously more open to variations in human sexuality than they are at present.
Ayoni sex, which includes oral and anal sex, never came to be viewed as much of a sin like in Christianity nor a serious crime and could be practiced in some cases. Close friendship between people of same genders has also been seen as permissible in Hindu texts.

Several Hindu priests have performed same-sex marriages, arguing that love is the result of attachments from previous births and that marriage, as a union of spirit, is transcendental to gender.

==== Buddhism ====

The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics are the Five Precepts and the Eightfold Path, one should neither be attached to nor crave sensual pleasure. The third of the Five Precepts is &quot;To refrain from committing sexual misconduct.&quot; However, &quot;sexual misconduct&quot; is a broad term, and is subjected to interpretation relative to the social norms of the followers. 
The determination of whether or not same-gender relations are appropriate for a layperson is not considered a religious matter by many Buddhists.

According to the Pāli Canon and Āgama (the Early Buddhist scriptures), there is not any saying that same or opposite gender relations have anything to do with sexual misconduct, and some Theravada monks express that same-gender relations do not violate the rule to avoid sexual misconduct, which means not having sex with someone under age (thus protected by their parents or guardians), someone betrothed or married or who has taken vows of religious celibacy.

Some later traditions gradually began to add new restrictions on sexual misconduct, like non-vagina sex, though some academics argue it usually involves situations seen as coerced sex. This non-vagina sex as sexual misconduct view is not based on Buddha&#x27;s teachings, but from later Abhidharma texts.

Buddhism is often characterized as distrustful of sensual enjoyment and sexuality in general. Traditionally, sex and lust are seen as hindering to spiritual progress in most schools of Buddhism; as such monks are expected to refrain from all sexual activity, and the Vinaya (the first book of the Tripitaka) specifically prohibits sexual intercourse, then further explain that anal, oral, and vaginal intercourse amount to sexual intercourse, which will result in permanent exclusion from Sangha. A notable exception in the history of Buddhism occurred in Japan during the Edo period, in which male homosexuality, or more specifically, love between young novices and older monks, were celebrated.

References to pandaka, a eunuch/impotence category that is sometimes interpreted to include homosexual males, can be found throughout the Pali canon as well as other Sanskrit scriptures. In the Chinese version of Sarvastivada Vinaya, the pandaka is mentioned as also trying to have sex with women, not just men. Leonard Zwilling refers extensively to Buddhaghosa&#x27;s Samantapasadika, where &quot;pandaka&quot; are described as being filled with defiled passions and insatiable lusts, and are dominated by their libido. Some texts of the Abhidharma state that a &quot;pandaka&quot; cannot achieve enlightenment in their own lifetime, (but must wait for rebirth) and Asanga and Vasubandhu discussed if a pandaka was able to be enlightened or not. According to one scriptural story, Ananda—Buddha&#x27;s cousin and disciple—was a &quot;pandaka&quot; in one of his many previous lives.

Some later classic Buddhist masters and texts disallow contact between monks/Bodhisattva and &quot;pandakas&quot;/women and classify non-vagina sex as sexual misconduct, including for lay followers.

The third of the five precepts of Buddhism states that one is to refrain from sexual misconduct; this precept has sometimes been interpreted to include homosexuality. The Dalai Lama of the Gelug sect of Tibetan Buddhism previously interpreted sexual misconduct to include lesbian and gay sex, and indeed any sex other than penis-vagina intercourse, including oral sex, anal sex, and masturbation or other sexual activity with the hand; the only time sex is acceptable is when it performed for its purpose of procreation. In 2009, when interviewed by Canadian TV news anchor Evan Solomon on &quot;CBC News: Sunday&quot; about whether or not homosexuality is acceptable in Buddhism, the Dalai Lama responded that &quot;it is sexual misconduct.&quot; However, the Dalai Lama supports human rights for all, &quot;regardless of sexual orientation.&quot; In the most recent interview on this topic (March 10, 2014), the Dalai Lama said gay marriage is &quot;OK&quot;, provided it is not in contradiction with the values of one&#x27;s chosen religion. Also in an Indian and Tibetan tradition, the Nalandabodhi sangha has stated that they are welcoming of all sexual orientations.

In Thailand, some accounts propose that &quot;homosexuality arises as a karmic consequence of violating Buddhist proscriptions against heterosexual misconduct. These karmic accounts describe homosexuality as a congenital condition which cannot be altered, at least in a homosexual person&#x27;s current lifetime, and have been linked with calls for compassion and understanding from the non-homosexual populace.&quot; However, Buddhist leaders in Thailand have also condemned homosexuality, ousted monks accused of homosexual acts, and banned kathoey from ordination. In 2009, Senior monk Phra Maha Wudhijaya Vajiramedh introduced a &quot;good manners&quot; curriculum for novices in the monkhood, stating to the BBC that he was concerned by &quot;the flamboyant behaviour of gay and transgender monks, who can often be seen wearing revealingly tight robes, carrying pink purses and having effeminately-shaped eyebrows.&quot; However, in Thailand, several leaders in the Theravada tradition including Phra Payom Kalayano have expressed support for LGBT rights.

A later popular Japanese legend attributed the introduction of monastic homosexuality to Japan to Shingon founder Kukai, although scholars now dismiss the veracity of this assertion, pointing out his strict adherence to the Vinaya. Nonetheless, the legend served to &quot;affirm same sex relation between men and boys in seventeenth century Japan.&quot; However, Japanese Buddhist scholar and author of &quot;Wild Azaleas&quot; Kitamura Kigin argued that there was a tendency in monasteries to avoid heterosexuality and to encourage homosexuality.

Although Mahayana Buddhism has some texts against homosexuality (from later Abhidharma texts and Buddhist apocrypha), the majority of its teachings assert that all beings who correctly practice the dharma may reach enlightenment, since all possess an innate Buddha nature. Enlightenment being achievable even in a single life. Some Mahayana Buddhist leaders were active in the movement for same-sex marriage rights in Taiwan which legalized same-sex marriages in 2019.

Well known Zen Buddhist, Thich Nhat Hanh, notes the spirit of Buddhism is inclusiveness and states &quot;when you look at the ocean, you see different kinds of waves, many sizes and shapes, but all the waves have water as their foundation and substance. If you are born gay or lesbian, your ground of being is the same as mine. We are different, but we share the same ground of being.&quot;

The capacity of Buddhism to reform itself and its great variety of distinct beliefs and schools, provide many liberal streams of Buddhism, which are accepting of all sexual orientations. Reformists of Buddhism are mainly predominant in cosmopolitan cities. In global traditions, there is a widescale support for LGBT rights including the European Buddhist Union, the Buddhist Churches of America, many Shin Buddhist groups, and Zen leaders such as Thich Nhat Hanh. The Federation of Australian Buddhist Councils (FABC), representing Buddhist laypeople, and the Australian Sangha Association vocally supported same-sex marriage in Australia. Soka Gakkai International-USA (SGI-USA) is the most diverse Buddhist community in the United States with more than 500 chapters and some 100 centers throughout the country supports LGBT rights. In a PEW research poll, 88% of American Buddhists stated that homosexuality should be accepted. This was a higher level of support than any other religious group studied.

==== Sikhism ====
Sikhism has no specific teachings about homosexuality and the Sikh holy scripture, the Guru Granth Sahib, does not explicitly mention heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality. The universal goal of a Sikh is to have no hate or animosity to any person, regardless of factors like race, caste, color, creed or gender.

Akal Takhat, the highest religious authority of the Sikhs, issued an edict (hukamnaama) in 2005 against any homosexual marriage in front of Sikh Scriptures (11th Guru of the Sikhs—Shri Guru Granth Sahib). This was again reiterated when one couple performed an Anand Karaj (Sikh religious marriage) of two homosexual men in 2020 in California. The couple was thrown out of the Sikh religion for this violation.

Gurbani based view:

In Sikh Scripture

In Guru Granth Sahib, marriage is seen as a union of souls. In Sikhism, the soul is seen as genderless, and the outward appearance of human beings (man, woman) is a temporary state. Same-sex marriage advocates refer to this fact.

===Zoroastrianism===

The Vendidad, one of the later Zoroastrian texts composed in the Artificial Young Avestan language, has not been dated precisely. It is thought that some concepts of law, uncleanliness, dualism, and salvation were shared between the religions, and subsequent interactions between the religions are documented by events such as the release of the Jews from the Babylonian captivity by Zoroastrian Cyrus the Great in 537 BC, and the Biblical account of the Magi visiting the infant Jesus.

The Vendidad generally promotes procreation: &quot;the man who has a wife is far above him who lives in continence; he who keeps a house is far above him who has none; he who has children is far above the childless man; he who has riches is far above him who has none.&quot; It details the penance for a worshipper who submits to sodomy under force as &quot;Eight hundred stripes with the Aspahe-astra, eight hundred stripes with the Sraosho-charana.&quot; (equal to the penalty for breaking a contract with the value of an ox), and declares that for those participating voluntarily &quot;For that deed there is nothing that can pay, nothing that can atone, nothing that can cleanse from it; it is a trespass for which there is no atonement, for ever and ever&quot;. However, those not practicing the Religion of Mazda were pardoned for past actions upon conversion. It has been argued that, in ancient times, those prohibitions against sodomy did not apply to eunuchs.

===East Asian religions===
Among the Taoic religions of East Asia, such as Taoism, passionate homosexual expression is usually discouraged because it is believed to not lead to human fulfillment.

==== Burmese folk religion ====

Many &quot;Nat Kadaws&quot; in traditional Burmese folk religion are members of the LGBT community.

==== Chinese folk religion ====

Tu&#x27;er Shen, also known as the Rabbit God, is a gay Chinese deity. In 2006, Lu Wei-ming founded a temple for Tu&#x27;er Shen and Taoist worship in Yonghe District in the New Taipei City in Taiwan. About 9,000 pilgrims visit the temple each year praying for a suitable (same-sex) partner. The Wei-ming temple also performs love ceremonies for gay couples. It is the world&#x27;s only religious shrine for homosexuals.

====Confucianism====
Confucianism, being primarily a social and political philosophy, focused little on sexuality; whether homosexual or heterosexual. However, the ideology did emphasize male friendships, and Louis Crompton has argued that the &quot;closeness of the master-disciple bond it fostered may have subtly facilitated homosexuality&quot;. Homosexuality is not mentioned in the Analects of Confucius.

==== Đạo Mẫu ====

In Vietnam, many LGBT people find a safe community within the &quot;Đạo Mẫu&quot; religion, which is worship of the mother god&quot;.&quot; Many LGBT people act as mediums during &quot;Đạo Mẫu&quot; rituals&quot;.&quot;

==== Shinto ====
Historically, Shinto &quot;had no special code of morals and seems to have regarded sex as a natural phenomenon to be enjoyed with few inhibitions.&quot; While Shinto beliefs are diverse, Japanese Shinto does not condemn homosexuality, and the formally organized Konkokyo sect is fully affirming. Multiple Shinto leaders advocated in support of gay marriage in Hawaii.

====Taoism====

There is no single official position on homosexuality in Taoism, as the term Taoism is used to describe a number of disparate religious traditions encompassing a variety of views. Although Taoist alchemy generally emphasized that ejaculation in heterosexual relationships represented a draining of the male&#x27;s &quot;life essence,&quot; this concept was not generally extended to non-heterosexual sex.

In a similar way to Buddhism, Taoist schools sought throughout history to define what would be sexual misconduct. Broadly speaking, the precept against &quot;sexual misconduct&quot; in Taoism relates to extramarital sex. The term for a married couple (夫婦) usually in Chinese suggests a male with a female, though Taoist scripture itself does not explicitly say anything against same-sex relations. Many sorts of precepts mentioned in the Yunji Qiqian (), The Mini Daoist Canon, does not explicitly say anything against same-gender relations as well.

Homosexuality is not unknown in Taoist history, such as during the Tang dynasty when Taoist nuns exchanged love poems. As a sexual misconduct however would depend on what sect or school they were from as some traditions considered homosexuality to be misconduct and others did not mention it at all. There are also certain talismans recorded in different traditions that claim to &quot;cure&quot; a person of the &quot;homosexual disease/desire&quot;. Attitudes about homosexuality within Taoism often reflect the values and sexual norms of broader Chinese society and what region of China the sect resided in (see Homosexuality in China).

=== African Diasporic religions ===

====Candomblé====
Within Candomblé, a syncretic religion found primarily in Brazil, there is widespread (though not universal) support for gay rights, many members are LGBT, and have performed gay marriages. In Candomblé, homosexuality is usually accepted and explained by the sex of one&#x27;s orisha. Homosexuality would be more probable in a man with a female orisha, a woman with a male orisha, or any of them with an androgynous orisha (such as Olokun).

==== Haitian Vodou ====

Homosexuality is religiously acceptable in Haitian Vodou. The lwa or loa (spirits) Erzulie Dantor and Erzulie Freda are often associated with and viewed as protectors of queer people. The lao Ghede Nibo is sometimes depicted as an effeminate drag queen and inspires those he inhabits to lascivious sexuality of all kinds.

==== Santería ====
Practitioners of Santería, primarily found in Cuba, generally (though not universally) welcome LGBT members and include them in religious or ritual activities.

==== Umbanda ====
Also a Brazilian syncretic religion, Umbanda houses generally support LGBT rights and have performed gay marriages.

=== New religious movements ===

==== Antoinism ====
Antoinism, a new religious movement founded in Belgium in 1910, does not provide any prescription on issues such as sexuality, as it considers that this is not related to spirituality; homosexuality is not deemed a sin and there is nothing wrong to be gay and antoinist.

==== Eckankar ====
Eckankar, an American new religious movement founded by Paul Twitchell in 1965, says on its website that &quot;where legally recognized, same-sex marriages are performed, in the form of the ECK Wedding Ceremony, by ordained ministers of Eckankar&quot;.

==== Neo-Druidism ====
The Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids is a worldwide group dedicated to practicing, teaching, and developing modern Druidry and has more than 25,000 members in 50 countries. The Order is LGBT-affirming within a larger framework of support for civil rights, love of justice, and the love of all existences.

==== Raëlism ====

Raëlism, an international new religious movement and UFO religion which was founded in France in 1974, promotes a positive outlook towards human sexuality, including homosexuality. Its founder Raël recognised same-sex marriage, and a Raëlian press release stated that sexual orientation is genetic and it also likened discrimination against gay people to racism. Some Raëlian leaders have performed licensed same-sex marriages.

==== Santa Muerte ====
The cult of Santa Muerte is a new religious movement centered on the worship of Santa Muerte, a cult image, female deity, and folk saint which is popularly revered in Mexican Neopaganism and folk Catholicism. A personification of death, she is associated with healing, protection, and safe delivery to the afterlife by her devotees. Santa Muerte is also revered and seen as a saint and protector of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) communities in Mexico, since LGBTQ+ people are considered and treated as outcasts by the Catholic Church, evangelical churches, and Mexican society at large. Many LGBTQ+ people ask her for protection from violence, hatred, disease, and to help them in their search for love. Her intercession is commonly invoked in same-sex marriage ceremonies performed in Mexico. The Iglesia Católica Tradicional México-Estados Unidos, also known as the Church of Santa Muerte, recognizes gay marriage and performs religious wedding ceremonies for homosexual couples. According to R. Andrew Chesnut, Ph.D. in Latin American history and professor of Religious studies, the cult of Santa Muerte is the single fastest-growing new religious movement in the Americas.

====Scientology====
The Church of Scientology opposes same-sex marriage and its founder L. Ron Hubbard called homosexuality a dangerous perversion. The Church of Scientology&#x27;s perspectives on homosexuality are based on the writings of its founder, and his statements about homosexuality have led critics to assert that Scientology promotes homophobia, and being gay or accused of being gay is viewed as negative in the Scientology community. According to a 2018 source, currently used, updated editions of Hubbard&#x27;s canonical book, &quot;&quot;, continue to use heteronormative and anti-gay language and list gay people as perverts who are physically ill and extremely dangerous to society. Some critics have stated that the church tried to change their gay attractions through forms of therapy.

=== Pre-colonial religions of the Americas ===
Many Nations had respected ceremonial, religious, and social roles for gender nonconforming Native American and First Nations communities, and these roles still exist. Homosexual and gender-variant individuals were also common among other pre-conquest civilizations in Latin America, such as the Aztecs, Mayans, Quechuas, Moches, Zapotecs, and the Tupinambá of Brazil and were accepted in their various religions.

However, the indigenous peoples of the Americas include hundreds of cultures with varying views on sex, gender, and spirituality. Additionally, First Nations and indigenous views on gender and sexuality may not fall within modern Western categorizations of sex and gender.

=== Pre-colonial religions of the Philippines ===

Filipino shamans, often known as &quot;babaylan&quot; held positions of authority as religious leaders or healers in some precolonial Philippine societies&quot;.&quot; Cross-dressing or gender nonconforming males sometimes took on the role of the female babaylan. Early historical accounts record the existence of male &quot;babaylans&quot; who wore female clothes and took the demeanor of a woman. Anatomy was not the only basis for gender. Being male or female was based primarily on occupation, appearance, actions and sexuality. A male &quot;babaylan&quot; could partake in romantic and sexual relations with other men without being judged by society. A small number of Filipinos practice local indigenous religions today.

===Paganism===


====Radical Faeries====
The Radical Faeries are a worldwide queer spiritual movement, founded in 1979 in the United States.

====Wicca====
The Wiccan &quot;Charge of the Goddess&quot;, one of the most famous texts in Neopaganism, states in the words of the Goddess, &quot;all acts of love and pleasure are my rituals&quot;. In traditional forms of Wicca, such as Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca, magic is often performed between a man and a woman, and the &quot;Great Rite&quot; is a sex ritual performed between a Priest and Priestess representing the God and Goddess; however, this is not generally seen as excluding homosexuals or magic between same-sex couples. While many groups still insist that initiations be conferred from man to woman or woman to man, Wicca has become a very diverse religion with varying views. As there is no central governing body nor a core authoritative text, individual covens and practitioners often establish their own guidelines. Many self-initiates are LGBTQ+ and form queer-centered covens and traditions.

===Satanism===

Both major Satanic traditions, The Satanic Temple and the Church of Satan, emphasise the right of the individual to free sexual expression. Lucien Greaves, spokesperson of The Satanic Temple, has stated the Temple &quot;will always fight... to the death to ensure that there are equal rights for the gay community.&quot;

===Unitarian Universalism===
The first ordained minister of a major religious sect in the U.S. or Canada to come out as gay was the UU Minister James Stoll in 1969. There have been denominational resolutions supporting LGBTQ people since 1970, when a resolution was passed that condemned discrimination against homosexuals. Unitarian Universalism was the first denomination to accept openly transgender people as full members with eligibility to become clergy; in 1988 the first openly transgender person was ordained by the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA).

The UUA has supported marriage equality since 1996 and compared those who resisted such equality to the resistance to the abolition of slavery, women&#x27;s suffrage, and the end of anti-miscegenation laws. Three-quarters of all UU congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural, and practical steps to become acknowledged as a &quot;Welcoming Congregation&quot;: a congregation that is intentionally welcoming and inclusive of LGBTQ members. On June 29, 1984, the UUA became the first major denomination &quot;to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions.&quot; Unitarian Universalists were in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. In May 2004, Arlington Street Church, Boston, was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. LGBTQ people are regularly ordained as ministers, and have also served at the highest levels of leadership in the denomination, including as president of the Canadian Unitarian Council, interim co-president of the Unitarian Universalist Association, and co-moderator of the UUA.

===Humanism===
Humanism is a non-religious, non-theistic approach to life that supports full equality for LGBTQ individuals, including the right to marry. &quot;Humanism and Its Aspirations&quot;, a statement of humanist principles from the American Humanist Association, states that &quot;humanists are concerned for the well being of all, are committed to diversity, and respect those of differing yet humane views...work to uphold the equal enjoyment of human rights and civil liberties in an open, secular society and maintain it is a civic duty to participate in the democratic process and a planetary duty to protect nature&#x27;s integrity, diversity, and beauty in a secure, sustainable manner.&quot; The American Humanist Association provides an LGBT Humanist Pride award and has funded an LGBT-inclusive prom for Itawamba County Agricultural High School in Mississippi. The organisation LGBT Humanists UK &quot;is a United Kingdom-based not-for-profit that campaigns for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) equality and human rights and promotes Humanism as an ethical worldview.&quot; It was formerly an independent group, but since 2012 has been a part of the charity Humanists UK. In 2009 they gave Stephen Fry an award &quot;for his services to humanism and gay rights.&quot;

Humanists UK Chief Executive Andrew Copson, who is gay, once wrote that &quot;humanists have always been champions of LGBT rights&quot; and cited his organisation&#x27;s many years campaigning for decriminalisation and LGBT equality in the UK, including legal same-sex marriages. He pointed out the large number of LGBT people in the movement, including Stephen Fry, Christian Jessen, and Peter Tatchell, as well as historical associations with humanism like the writer Virginia Woolf and E M Forster. In a statement following the Orlando nightclub shooting for the International Humanist and Ethical Union, of which Copson is also President, he went further, saying &quot;Humanism is the ultimate, long-standing and unfaltering ally of LGBTI people everywhere&quot;.

===Unification Church===
Unification Church views heterosexual marriage which becomes &quot;fruitful&quot; by raising their children as God&#x27;s ideal. Any other sexual relationship, than between husband and wife, is considered a sin. 
Unification Church founder Sun Myung Moon opposed homosexuality and free sex and in some of his speeches compared such relationships to &quot;dirty dung filled water&quot; and that &quot;Satan and dirty dung-eating dogs go after that&quot;. He prophesied that &quot;gays will be eliminated&quot; in a &quot;purge on God&#x27;s orders&quot;.

==Religious groups and public policy==
Opposition to same-sex marriage and LGBT rights is often associated with conservative religious views. The American Family Association and other religious groups have promoted boycotts of corporations whose policies support the LGBT community.

In conservative Islamic nations, laws generally prohibit same-sex sexual behaviour, and interpretation of Sharia Law on male homosexuality carries the death penalty. This has been condemned as a violation of human rights by human rights organisation Amnesty International and by the writers of the Yogyakarta principles. With the signature of the US in 2009, the proposed UN declaration on LGBT rights has now been signed by every European secular state and all western nations, as well as other countries—67 members of the UN in total. An opposing statement put forward by Muslim nations was signed by 57 member states, mostly in Africa and Asia. 68 out of the total 192 countries have not yet signed either statement. In 2011 the United Nations Human Rights Council passed a landmark resolution initiated by South Africa supporting LGBT rights (&quot;See Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity at the United Nations&quot;).

<text>RPGnet is a role-playing game website. It includes sections on wargames, tabletop games and video games, as well as columns on gaming topics.

RPGnet was founded in 1996 by Emma and Sandy Antunes, Shawn Althouse ( etrigan) and Brian David Phillips, as a way to unify a number of transient game sites. In 2001 it was purchased by Skotos Tech, but maintains creative and editorial autonomy. Currently it is being run by Shannon Appelcline of Skotos, while a number of volunteer moderators and administrators help maintain the forums.
In 2024, RPG.net was sold to RPGMatch, who would take over development duties while the administration of the forums was to remain independent. 
==RPGnet services==
===Forums===
Originally based on Matt&#x27;s WWWBoard script, the 1997 RPGnet forums were formatted in earlier message boards&#x27; threaded style, being mostly dedicated to game design and industry news. With the change to vBulletin on 2002, new sections catering to the growing player and enthusiast user bases were added. The boards used vBulletin for the next sixteen years, until November, 2018, when they were migrated to the XenForo 2 software package.

Over time, the RPGnet forums have grown to encompass a broad range of subjects related to gaming and modern media. &quot;Tabletop Roleplaying Open&quot;, the general game discussion forum, has the most posts per day. There are also video games, play-by-post and board games forums, a section dedicated to game design, publishing and brainstorming in general, while the &quot;Other Media&quot; covers television, comic books, movies and books. The site also hosts small forums for photography, parenting, and other specific interests.

Like most large forums, RPGnet has developed numerous in-jokes, taglines, and recurring flame wars. Many game writers, artists, and designers post. Content and conduct rules are enforced by moderators, who &quot;can do what they feel is necessary in their best judgment to promote the well-being of the forums,&quot; even going beyond any written rules, &quot;in order to keep the forums friendly and welcoming.&quot; A list of sanctions and bans on users assessed by the moderators is available for public view. RPGnet policies have occasionally been referenced by other platforms and forums when drawing their own policies.

A wide range of tastes are present on the forums. Smaller niche and indie role-playing games are particularly well represented and the latest releases often generate a great deal of discussion. Threads on Dungeons &amp; Dragons, World of Darkness, GURPS and other popular systems are fairly common. Exalted is known for generating a particularly large number of discussion threads.

Other websites will excerpt or reference forum posts that (much as with the Fark PhotoShop contests) have lasting value, such as ZenDesign excerpting WoW-erizing movie quotes and From the Shop Floor borrowing from the Demotivators thread.

===Reviews===
Reviews have been an important part of RPGnet since its inception. Today, RPGnet has an active archive of approximately 13,000 reviews. Most reviews are of roleplaying games or supplements. In the last few years, users have contributed numerous reviews of board and card games. RPGnet also publishes reviews of movies, books, music albums and comics, though less frequently.

The review system was overhauled in early 2003 and since then reviews have appeared with numerous cross-references in an effort to improve navigation of the large review archive.

Currently, reviews appear on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. RPG reviews are published on Mondays and Fridays, while reviews of other products are published on Wednesdays.

===Columns and articles===
RPGnet currently has approximately 20 regular columns. Columns are posted on a four-week, Monday-Friday schedule (with 3 to 4 columns posted during a typical week, as per columnist cooperation), with any &quot;extra weeks&quot; in the schedule filled in with additional columns, as they become available. Most columns cover gamemasters offering advice on running roleplaying games to other gamemasters, but there is some variety. This site has become noted as a source for player theory on role-playing games, and these are often written by authors with an academic background.

Notable columns have included: 52 Pickup which promised to offer a new game every week for a year (it got to about a dozen before the initial author gave up, then another dozen before the second one did); Behind the Counter which continues to detail the runnings of a gaming retail store; and Freelancing is Not Free which describes how to freelance in the gaming industry. Noteworthy columnists have included game industry veterans such as Ross Winn, Chad Underkoffler and Matt Drake. Sandy Antunes&#x27; monthly column has run without interruption since inception.

The forums include threads describing actual play of role-playing games in concrete terms. These threads include descriptions of how players have overcome specific challenges, and they allow observers to view how a role-playing game is performed without having to actually participate.

The columns software was upgraded in 2006, and it now includes full RSS feeds as well as a variety of database-oriented lookups and full integration into the RPGnet forums.

Prior to 2008, Columns Editing was handled by C.W. Richeson (2008), Shannon Appelcline (2006–2007), Michael Fiegel (2001–2005) and Sandy Antunes (inception - 2001). As of January 2008, it is handled by Shannon Appelcline.

RPGnet columns have been referenced on Slashdot (including &quot;Gaming Girls of GenCon&quot; and &quot;A History of Wizards of the Coast&quot;), as well as on many blogs and gaming sites.

===Wiki===
The RPGnet wiki was added in early 2005. Initially conceived as a place for people jointly design roleplaying supplements and game systems, it has also been used assemble an encyclopedia of roleplaying terms and resources, and compile information about ongoing campaigns taking place on the forums.

The RPGnet Wiki is built on MediaWiki, the same software used by Wikipedia.

===Gaming Index===
In 2006, RPGnet added a catalog of role-playing games known as the Gaming Index. This system is intended to hold every English RPG product, and is searchable through a variety of means, notable hyperlinks to other products by the publisher, authors or game line and links to RPGnet&#x27;s reviews of the product. Users can add products, rank, and comment on them. As of November 13, 2018, the site has 19832 games, 3250 additional editions, and 2245 magazines, accounting for 1458 unique game systems.

===Other features===
RPGnet formerly featured a RPG store, which is a RPGnet-branded version of RPGShop. The site also offers a membership program which gives subscribers early access to reviews, a few forum privileges, and online access to some Days of Wonder games.

The Game Manufacturers Association (GAMA) publishes a semi-annual journal called &quot;Games and Education&quot;. As of 1998, past issues of this journal are archived on the RPGnet site.

<doc id="26042" wikidata="Q192906" url="?curid=26042" title="Revelation">
<text>Revelation or Divine revelation is the disclosing of some form of truth or knowledge through communication with a deity (god) or other supernatural entity or entities, in the view of religion and theology.

==Types==
===Individual revelation===
Thomas Aquinas believed in two types of individual revelation from God, &quot;general revelation&quot; and &quot;special revelation&quot;. In general revelation, God reveals himself through his creation, such that at least some truths about God can be learned by the empirical study of nature, physics, cosmology, etc., to an individual. Special revelation is the knowledge of God and spiritual matters which can be discovered through supernatural means, such as scripture or miracles, by individuals. Direct revelation refers to communication from God to someone in particular.

Though one may deduce the existence of God and some of God&#x27;s attributes through general revelation, certain specifics may be known only through special revelation. Aquinas believed that special revelation is equivalent to the revelation of God in Jesus. The major theological components of Christianity, such as the Trinity and the Incarnation, are revealed in the teachings of the church and the scriptures and may not otherwise be deduced. The teachings of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, are also of this nature. The holy book of Muslims, the Quran, is the product of a special revelation from God to Muhammad, which led to the emergence of the last divine religion, Islam. Special revelation and general revelation are complementary rather than contradictory in nature. That is, in understanding a &quot;special revelation&quot;, first a &quot;general revelation&quot; provides the conditions, and after that &quot;special revelation&quot; occurs, the subsequent conditions for the occurrence of the &quot;general revelation&quot; also change at will.

According to Dumitru Stăniloae, Eastern Orthodox Church’s position on general/special revelation is in stark contrast to Protestant and Catholic theologies that see a clear difference between general and special revelation and tend to argue that the former is not sufficient to salvation. In Orthodox Christianity, he argues, there is no separation between the two and supernatural revelation merely embodies the former in historical persons and actions.

&quot;Continuous revelation&quot; is a term for the theological position that God continues to reveal divine principles or commandments to humanity.

In the 20th century, religious existentialists proposed that revelation held no content in and of itself but rather that God inspired people with his presence by coming into contact with them. Revelation is a human response that records how we respond to God.

The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, wrote of his personal experience of inspiration and his own experience of “the idea of revelation” in his work &quot;Ecce Homo&quot;:
===Public revelation===

Some religious groups believe a deity has been revealed or spoken to a large group of people or have legends to a similar effect. In the Book of Exodus, Yahweh is said to have given Ten Commandments to the Israelites at Mount Sinai. In Christianity, the Book of Acts describes the Day of Pentecost wherein the Holy Spirit descended on the disciples of Jesus in the form of fire that they began praising in tongues and experienced mass revelation. The Lakota people believe Ptesáŋwiŋ spoke directly to the people in the establishment of Lakota religious traditions. Some versions of an Aztec legend tell of Huitzilopochtli speaking directly to the Aztec people upon their arrival at Anåhuac. Historically, some emperors, cult leaders, and other figures have also been deified and treated as though their words are themselves revelations.

==Methods==
===Verbal===
Some people hold that God can communicate with people in a way that gives direct, propositional content: This is termed &quot;verbal revelation&quot;. Orthodox Judaism and some forms of Christianity hold that the first five books of Moses were dictated by God in such a fashion.

Isaiah writes that he received his message through visions, where he would see YHWH, the God of Israel, speaking to angelic beings that surrounded him. Isaiah would then write down the dialogue exchanged between YHWH and the angels. This form of revelation constitutes the major part of the text of the Book of Isaiah. The same formula of divine revelation is used by other prophets throughout the Tanakh, such as Micaiah in 1 Kings 22:19–22.

===Non-verbal propositional===
One school of thought holds that revelation is non-verbal and non-literal, yet it may have propositional content. People were divinely inspired by God with a message, but not in a verbal-like sense.

Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel has written, &quot;To convey what the prophets experienced, the Bible could either use terms of descriptions or terms of indication. Any description of the act of revelation in empirical categories would have produced a caricature. That is why all the Bible does is to state that revelation happened; how it happened is something they could only convey in words that are evocative and suggestive.&quot;

==Epistemology==
Members of Abrahamic religions, including Judaism, Christianity and Islam, believe that God exists and can in some way reveal his will to people. Members of those religions distinguish between true prophets and false prophets, and there are documents offering criteria by which to distinguish true from false prophets. The question of epistemology then arises: how to know?

Some believe that revelation can originate directly from a deity or through an agent such as an angel. One who has experienced such contact with, or communication from, the divine is often called a prophet. &quot;The Norton Dictionary of Modern Thought&quot; suggests that the more proper and wider term for such an encounter would be &quot;mystical&quot;, making such a person a mystic. All prophets would be mystics, but not all mystics would be prophets.

Revelation from a supernatural source is of lesser importance in some other religious traditions, such as Taoism and Confucianism.

==In various religions==

===Bahá&#x27;í Faith===
The Báb, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh and `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá, the central figures of the Bahá&#x27;í Faith, received thousands of written enquiries, and wrote thousands of responses, hundreds of which amount to whole and proper books, while many are shorter texts, such as letters. In addition, the Bahá&#x27;í Faith has large works which were divinely revealed in a very short time, as in a night, or a few days. Additionally, because many of the works were first recorded by an amanuensis, most were submitted for approval and correction and the final text was personally approved by the revelator.

Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh would occasionally write the words of revelation down himself, but normally the revelation was dictated to his amanuensis, who sometimes recorded it in what has been called &quot;revelation writing&quot;, a shorthand script written with extreme speed owing to the rapidity of the utterance of the words. Afterwards, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh revised and approved these drafts. These &quot;revelation drafts&quot; and many other transcriptions of Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh&#x27;s writings, around 15,000 items, some of which are in his own handwriting, are kept in the International Bahá&#x27;í Archives in Haifa, Israel.

===Christianity===

Many Christians believe in the possibility and even reality of private revelations, messages from God for individuals, which can come in a variety of ways. Montanism is an example in early Christianity and there are alleged cases today also. However, Christians see as of a much higher level the revelation recorded in the collection of books known as the Bible. They consider these books to be written by human authors under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. They regard Jesus as the supreme revelation of God, with the Bible being a revelation in the sense of a witness to him. The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; states that &quot;the Christian faith is not a &#x27;religion of the book.&#x27; Christianity is the religion of the &#x27;Word of God&#x27;, a word which is &#x27;not a written and mute word, but the Word which is incarnate and living&quot;.

Geisler and Nix speak of Biblical inerrancy as meaning that, in its original form, the Bible is totally without error, and free from all contradiction, including the historical and scientific parts. Coleman speaks of Biblical infallibility as meaning that the Bible is inerrant on issues of faith and practice but not history or science. The Catholic Church speaks not about infallibility of Scripture but about its freedom from error, holding &quot;the doctrine of the inerrancy of Scripture&quot;. The Second Vatican Council, citing earlier declarations, stated: &quot;Since everything asserted by the inspired authors or sacred writers must be held to be asserted by the Holy Spirit, it follows that the books of Scripture must be acknowledged as teaching solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God wanted put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation&quot;. It added: &quot;Since God speaks in Sacred Scripture through men in human fashion, the interpreter of Sacred Scripture, in order to see clearly what God wanted to communicate to us, should carefully investigate what meaning the sacred writers really intended, and what God wanted to manifest by means of their words.&quot; The Reformed Churches believe in the Bible is inerrant in the sense spoken of by Gregory and Nix and &quot;deny that Biblical infallibility and inerrancy are limited to spiritual, religious, or redemptive themes, exclusive of assertions in the fields of history and science&quot;. The Westminster Confession of Faith speaks of &quot;the infallible truth and divine authority&quot; of the Scriptures.

In the New Testament, Jesus treats the Old Testament as authoritative and says it &quot;cannot be broken&quot; . 2 Timothy 3:16 says: &quot;All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness&quot;. The Second Epistle of Peter claims that &quot;no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone&#x27;s own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit&quot;. It also speaks of Paul&#x27;s letters as containing some things &quot;hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures&quot;.

This letter does not specify &quot;the other Scriptures&quot;, nor does the term &quot;all Scripture&quot; in 2 Timothy indicate which writings were or would be breathed out by God and useful for teaching, since it does not preclude later works, such as the Book of Revelation and the Epistles of John may have been. The Catholic Church recognizes 73 books as inspired and forming the Bible (46 books of the Old Testament and 27 books of the New Testament). The most common versions of the Bible that Protestants have today consist of 66 of these books. None of the 66 or 73 books gives a list of revealed books.

Theologian and Christian existentialist philosopher Paul Johannes Tillich (1886–1965), who sought to correlate culture and faith so that &quot;faith need not be unacceptable to contemporary culture and contemporary culture need not be unacceptable to faith&quot;, argued that revelation never runs counter to reason (affirming Thomas Aquinas who said that faith is eminently rational), and that both poles of the subjective human experience are complementary.

Karl Barth argued that God is the object of God&#x27;s own self-knowledge, and revelation in the Bible means the self-unveiling to humanity of the God who cannot be discovered by humanity simply through its own efforts. For him, the Bible is not &quot;The Revelation&quot;; rather, it points to revelation. Human concepts can never be considered as identical to God&#x27;s revelation, and Scripture is written in human language, expressing human concepts. It cannot be considered identical with God&#x27;s revelation. However, God does reveal himself through human language and concepts, and thus Christ is truly presented in scripture and the preaching of the church.

==== Catholic Church ====
The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; of the Catholic Church states:

The Catholic Church also believes Jesus Christ is the &quot;fullness and mediator of all Revelations&quot;, and that no new divine revelation will come until the Second Coming. It also believes that God gradually leads the church into a deeper understanding of divine revelation, such as by private revelations, which do not fulfill, complete, substitute or supersede divine revelation but help one live by divine revelation. The church does not obligate the faithful to believe in, follow, or publish private revelations, whether they&#x27;re approved or otherwise.

====Latter Day Saint movement====
The Latter Day Saint movement teaches that the movement began with a revelation from God, which began a process of restoring the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth. Latter Day Saints also teach that revelation is the foundation of the church established by Jesus Christ and that it remains an essential element of his true church today. Continuous revelation provides individual Latter Day Saints with a testimony, described by Richard Bushman as &quot;one of the most potent words in the Mormon lexicon&quot;.

Latter Day Saints believe in an open scriptural canon, and in addition to the Bible and the Book of Mormon, have books of scripture containing the revelations of modern-day prophets such as the Doctrine and Covenants and the Pearl of Great Price. In addition, many Latter Day Saints believe that ancient prophets in other regions of the world received revelations that resulted in additional scriptures that have been lost and may, one day, be forthcoming. Latter Day Saints also believe that the United States Constitution is a divinely inspired document.

=====Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints=====
Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints sustain the President of the Church as prophet, seer, and revelator, the only person on earth who receives revelation to guide the entire church. They also sustain the two counselors in the First Presidency, as well as the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, as prophets, seers, and revelators. They believe that God has followed a pattern of continued revelation to prophets throughout the history of mankind to establish doctrine and maintain its integrity, as well as to guide the church under changing world conditions. When this pattern of revelation was broken, it was because the receivers of revelation had been rejected and often killed. In the meridian of time, Paul described prophets and apostles in terms of a foundation, with Christ as the cornerstone, which was built to prevent doctrinal shift—&quot;that we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about by every wind of doctrine&quot;. To maintain this foundation, new apostles were chosen and ordained to replace those lost to death or transgression, as when Matthias was called by revelation to replace Judas (Acts 1:15–26). However, as intensifying persecution led to the imprisonment and martyrdom of the apostles, it eventually became impossible to continue the apostolic succession.

Once the foundation of apostles and prophets was lost, the integrity of Christian doctrine as established by Christ and the apostles began to be compromised by those who continued to develop doctrine despite not being called or authorized to receive revelation for the body of the church. In the absence of revelation, these post-apostolic theologians couldn&#x27;t help but introduce elements of human reasoning, speculation, and personal interpretation of scripture (2 Pet 1:19–20)—which over time led to the loss or corruption of various doctrinal truths, as well as the addition of new man-made doctrines. This naturally led to much disagreement and schism, which over the centuries culminated in the large number of Christian churches on the earth today. Mormons believe that God resumed his pattern of revelation when the world was again ready, by calling the Prophet Joseph Smith to restore the fullness of the gospel of Jesus Christ to the earth. Since that time there has been a consistent succession of prophets and apostles, which God has promised will not be broken before the Second Coming of Christ (Dan 2:44).

Each member of the LDS Church is also confirmed a member of the church following baptism and given the &quot;gift of the Holy Ghost&quot; by which each member is encouraged to develop a personal relationship with that divine being and receive personal revelation for their own direction and that of their family. The Latter Day Saint concept of revelation includes the belief that revelation from God is available to all those who earnestly seek it with the intent of doing good. It also teaches that everyone is entitled to personal revelation with respect to his or her stewardship (leadership responsibility). Thus, parents may receive inspiration from God in raising their families, individuals can receive divine inspiration to help them meet personal challenges, church officers may receive revelation for those whom they serve, and so forth.

The important consequence of this is that each person may receive confirmation that particular doctrines taught by a prophet are true, as well as gain divine insight in using those truths for their own benefit and eternal progress. In the church, personal revelation is expected and encouraged, and many converts believe that personal revelation from God was instrumental in their conversion. Joseph F. Smith, the sixth president of the LDS Church, summarized this church&#x27;s belief concerning revelation by saying, &quot;We believe… in the principle of direct revelation from God to man&quot; (Smith, 362).

==== Deism ====
With the development of rationalism, materialism, and atheism during the Age of Enlightenment in Europe, beginning about the mid-17th century, the concept of supernatural revelation began to face skepticism. In &quot;The Age of Reason&quot; (1794–1809), Thomas Paine developed the theology of deism, rejecting the possibility of miracles and arguing that a revelation can be considered valid only for the original recipient, with all else being hearsay.

===Hinduism===

Śruti, Sanskrit for &quot;that which is heard&quot;, refers to the body of most authoritative, ancient religious texts comprising the central canon of Hinduism. It includes the four Vedas including its four types of embedded texts—the Samhitas, the early Upanishads. &quot;Śruti&quot;s have been variously described as a revelation through &quot;anubhava&quot; (direct experience), or of primordial origins realized by ancient Rishis. In Hindu tradition, they have been referred to as &quot;apauruṣeya&quot; (not created by humans). The &quot;Śruti&quot; texts themselves assert that they were skillfully created by Rishis (sages), after inspired creativity, just as a carpenter builds a chariot.

===Islam===
Muslims believe that God (Arabic: ألله &quot;Allah&quot;) revealed his final message to all of existence through Muhammad via the angel Gabriel. Muhammad is considered to have been the Seal of the Prophets and the last revelation, the Qur&#x27;an, is believed by Muslims to be the flawless final revelation of God to humanity, valid until the Last Day. The Qur&#x27;an claims to have been revealed word by word and letter by letter.

Muslims hold that the message of Islam is the same as the message preached by all the messengers sent by God to humanity since Adam. Muslims believe that Islam is the oldest of the monotheistic religions because it represents both the original and the final revelation of God to Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus, and Muhammad. Likewise, Muslims believe that every prophet received revelation in their lives, as each prophet was sent by God to guide mankind. Jesus is significant in this aspect as he received revelation in a twofold aspect, as Muslims believe he preached the Gospel while also having been taught the Torah.

According to Islamic traditions, Muhammad began receiving revelations from the age of 40, delivered through the angel Gabriel over the last 23 years of his life. The content of these revelations, known as the Qur&#x27;an, was memorized and recorded by his followers and compiled from dozens of hafiz as well as other various parchments or hides into a single volume shortly after his death. In Muslim theology, Muhammad is considered equal in importance to all other prophets of God and to make distinction among the prophets is a sin, as the Qur&#x27;an itself promulgates equality between God&#x27;s prophets.

Many scholars have made the distinction between revelation and inspiration, which according to Muslim theology, all righteous people can receive. Inspiration refers to God inspiring a person to commit some action, as opposed to revelation, which only the prophets received. Moses&#x27;s mother, Jochebed, being inspired to send the infant Moses in a cradle down the Nile river is a frequently cited example of inspiration, as is Hagar searching for water for the infant Ishmael.

===Judaism===

The term &quot;revelation&quot; is used in two senses in Jewish theology; it either denotes (1) what in rabbinical language is called &quot;Gilluy Shekinah&quot;, a manifestation of God by some wondrous act of his which overawes man and impresses him with what he sees, hears, or otherwise perceives of his glorious presence; or it denotes (2) a manifestation of his will through oracular words, signs, statutes, or laws.

In Judaism, issues of epistemology have been addressed by Jewish philosophers such as Saadiah Gaon (882–942) in his Book of Beliefs and Opinions; Maimonides (1135–1204) in his Guide for the Perplexed; Samuel Hugo Berman, professor of philosophy at the Hebrew University; Joseph Dov Soloveitchik (1903–1993), talmudic scholar and philosopher; Neil Gillman, professor of philosophy at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, and Elliot N. Dorff, professor of philosophy at the American Jewish University.

One of the major trends in modern Jewish philosophy was the attempt to develop a theory of Judaism through existentialism. One of the primary players in this field was Franz Rosenzweig. His major work, &quot;Star of Redemption&quot;, expounds a philosophy in which he portrays the relationships between God, humanity and world as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption.
Conservative Jewish philosophers Elliot N. Dorff and Neil Gillman take the existentialist philosophy of Rosenzweig as one of their starting points for understanding Jewish philosophy. (They come to different conclusions, however.)

Rabbinic Judaism, and contemporary Orthodox Judaism, hold that the Torah (Pentateuch) extant today is essentially the same one that the whole of the Jewish people received on Mount Sinai, from God, upon their Exodus from Egypt. Beliefs that God gave a &quot;Torah of truth&quot; to Moses (and the rest of the people), that Moses was the greatest of the prophets, and that the Law given to Moses will never be changed, are three of the Thirteen Principles of Faith of Orthodox Judaism according to Maimonides.

Orthodox Judaism believes that in addition to the written Torah, God also revealed to Moses a set of oral teachings, called the Oral Torah. In addition to this revealed law, Jewish law contains decrees and enactments made by prophets, rabbis, and sages over the course of Jewish history. Haredi Judaism tends to regard even rabbinic decrees as being of divine origin or divinely inspired, while Modern Orthodox Judaism tends to regard them as being more potentially subject to human error, although due to the Biblical verse &quot;Do not stray from their words&quot; (&quot;Deuteronomy 17:11) it is still accepted as binding law.

Conservative Judaism tends to regard both the Torah and the Oral law as not verbally revealed. The Conservative approach tends to regard the Torah as compiled by redactors in a manner similar to the Documentary Hypothesis. However, Conservative Jews also regard the authors of the Torah as divinely inspired, and many regard at least portions of it as originating with Moses. Positions can vary from the position of Joel Roth, following David Weiss HaLivni, that while the Torah originally given to Moses on Mount Sinai became corrupted or lost and had to be recompiled later by redactors, the recompiled Torah is nonetheless regarded as fully Divine and legally authoritative, to the position of Gordon Tucker that the Torah, while Divinely inspired, is a largely human document containing significant elements of human error, and should be regarded as the beginning of an ongoing process which is continuing today. Conservative Judaism regards the Oral Law as divinely inspired, but nonetheless subject to human error.

Reform and Reconstructionist Jews also accept the Documentary Hypothesis for the origin of the Torah, and tend to view all of the Oral law as an entirely human creation. Reform believe that the Torah is not a direct revelation from God, but is a document written by human ancestors, carrying human understanding and experience, and seeking to answer the question: &#x27;What does God require of us?&#x27;. They believe that, though it contains many &#x27;core-truths&#x27; about God and humanity, it is also time bound. They believe that God&#x27;s will is revealed through the interaction of humanity and God throughout history, and so, in that sense, Torah is a product of an ongoing revelation. Reconstructionist Judaism denies the notion of revelation entirely.

====Prophets====
Although the Nevi&#x27;im (the books of the Prophets) are considered divine and true, this does not imply that the books of the prophets are always read literally. Jewish tradition has always held that prophets used metaphors and analogies. There exists a wide range of commentaries explaining and elucidating those verses consisting of metaphor. Rabbinic Judaism regards Moses as the greatest of the prophets, and this view is one of the Thirteen Principles of Faith of traditional Judaism. Consistent with the view that revelation to Moses was generally clearer than revelation to other prophets, Orthodox views of revelation to prophets other than Moses have included a range of perspectives as to directness. For example, Maimonides in &quot;The Guide for the Perplexed&quot; said that accounts of revelation in the Nevi&#x27;im were not always as literal as in the Torah and that some prophetic accounts reflect allegories rather than literal commands or predictions.

Conservative Rabbi and philosopher Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907–1972), author of a number of works on prophecy, said that, &quot;Prophetic inspiration must be understood &quot;as an event&quot;, not as &quot;a process&quot;.&quot; In his work &quot;God in Search of Man&quot;, he discussed the experience of being a prophet. In his book &quot;Prophetic Inspiration After the Prophets: Maimonides and Others&quot;, Heschel references to continued prophetic inspiration in Jewish rabbinic literature following the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and into medieval and even Modern times. He wrote that:

:&quot;To convey what the prophets experienced, the Bible could either use terms of descriptions or terms of indication. Any description of the act of revelation in empirical categories would have produced a caricature. That is why all the Bible does is to state that revelation happened. How it happened is something they could only convey in words that are evocative and suggestive.&quot;

===Sikhism===
The Guru Granth Sahib is considered to be a divine revelation by God to the Sikh gurus. 
In various verses of Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh gurus themselves state that they merely speak what the divine teacher (God) commands them to speak.
Guru Nanak frequently used to tell his ardent follower Mardana &quot;Oh Mardana, play the rabaab the Lord&#x27;s word is descending onto me.&quot;

In certain passages of Guru Granth sahib, it is clearly said the authorship is of divine origin and the gurus were merely the channel through which such revelations came.

==Revealed religion==

Revealed religions have religious texts which they view as divinely or supernaturally revealed or inspired. For instance, Orthodox Jews, Christians and Muslims believe that the &quot;Torah&quot; was received from God on biblical Mount Sinai. Most Christians believe that both the Old Testament and the New Testament were inspired by God. Muslims believe the Quran was revealed by God to Muhammad word by word through the angel Gabriel (&quot;Jibril&quot;). In Hinduism, the Vedas are considered &quot;&quot;, &quot;not human compositions&quot;, and are supposed to have been directly revealed, and thus are called &quot;śruti&quot;, &quot;what is heard&quot;. Hindus also consider the Bhagavad Gita to contain direct revelation from Krishna.

A revelation communicated by a supernatural entity reported as being present during the event is called a vision. Direct conversations between the recipient and the supernatural entity, or physical marks such as stigmata, have been reported. In rare cases, such as that of Saint Juan Diego, physical artifacts accompany the revelation. The Roman Catholic concept of interior locution includes just an inner voice heard by the recipient.

In the Abrahamic religions, the term is used to refer to the process by which God reveals knowledge of himself, his will, and his divine providence to the world of human beings. In secondary usage, revelation refers to the resulting human knowledge about God, prophecy, and other divine things. Revelation from a supernatural source plays a less important role in some other religious traditions such as Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism.

&quot;Quakers&quot;, known formally as the Religious Society of Friends, are generally united by a belief in each human&#x27;s ability to experience the light within or see &quot;that of God in every one&quot;. Most Quakers believe in continuing revelation: that God continuously reveals truth directly to individuals. George Fox said, &quot;Christ has come to teach His people Himself.&quot; Friends often focus on feeling the presence of God. As Isaac Penington wrote in 1670, &quot;It is not enough to hear of Christ, or read of Christ, but this is the thing – to feel him to be my root, my life, and my foundation...&quot; Quakers reject the idea of priests, believing in the priesthood of all believers. Some express their concept of God using phrases such as &quot;the inner light&quot;, &quot;inward light of Christ&quot;, or &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;. Quakers first gathered around George Fox in the mid–17th century and belong to a historically Protestant Christian set of denominations.
