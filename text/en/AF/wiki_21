<text>Psychotherapy (also psychological therapy, talk therapy, or talking therapy) is the use of psychological methods, particularly when based on regular personal interaction, to help a person change behavior, increase happiness, and overcome problems. Psychotherapy aims to improve an individual&#x27;s well-being and mental health, to resolve or mitigate troublesome behaviors, beliefs, compulsions, thoughts, or emotions, and to improve relationships and social skills. Numerous types of psychotherapy have been designed either for individual adults, families, or children and adolescents. Some types of psychotherapy are considered evidence-based for treating diagnosed mental disorders; other types have been criticized as pseudoscience.
There are hundreds of psychotherapy techniques, some being minor variations; others are based on very different conceptions of psychology. Most approaches involve one-to-one sessions, between the client and therapist, but some are conducted with groups, including couples and families.

Psychotherapists may be mental health professionals such as psychiatrists, psychologists, mental health nurses, clinical social workers, marriage and family therapists, or licensed professional counselors. Psychotherapists may also come from a variety of other backgrounds, and depending on the jurisdiction may be legally regulated, voluntarily regulated or unregulated (and the term itself may be protected or not).

== Definitions ==
The term &quot;&quot; is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;&quot; ( meaning &quot;breath; spirit; soul&quot;) and &quot;therapeia&quot; ( &quot;healing; medical treatment&quot;). The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines it as &quot;The treatment of disorders of the mind or personality by psychological means...&quot;, however, in earlier use, it denoted the treatment of disease through hypnotic suggestion. Psychotherapy is often dubbed as a &quot;talking therapy&quot; or &quot;talk therapy&quot;, particularly for a general audience, though not all forms of psychotherapy rely on verbal communication. Children or adults who do not engage in verbal communication (or not in the usual way) are not excluded from psychotherapy; indeed some types are designed for such cases.

The American Psychological Association adopted a resolution on the effectiveness of psychotherapy in 2012 based on a definition developed by American psychologist John C. Norcross: &quot;Psychotherapy is the informed and intentional application of clinical methods and interpersonal stances derived from established psychological principles for the purpose of assisting people to modify their behaviors, cognitions, emotions, and/or other personal characteristics in directions that the participants deem desirable&quot;. Influential editions of a work by psychiatrist Jerome Frank defined psychotherapy as a healing relationship using socially authorized methods in a series of contacts primarily involving words, acts and rituals—which Frank regarded as forms of persuasion and rhetoric. Historically, psychotherapy has sometimes meant &quot;interpretative&quot; (i.e. Freudian) methods, namely psychoanalysis, in contrast with other methods to treat psychiatric disorders such as behavior modification.

Some definitions of counseling overlap with psychotherapy (particularly in non-directive client-centered approaches), or counseling may refer to guidance for everyday problems in specific areas, typically for shorter durations with a less medical or &quot;professional&quot; focus. Somatotherapy refers to the use of physical changes as injuries and illnesses, and sociotherapy to the use of a person&#x27;s social environment to effect therapeutic change. Psychotherapy may address spirituality as a significant part of someone&#x27;s mental / psychological life, and some forms are derived from spiritual philosophies, but practices based on treating the spiritual as a separate dimension are not necessarily considered as traditional or &#x27;legitimate&#x27; forms of psychotherapy.

== Delivery ==
Psychotherapy may be delivered in person (one on one, or with couples, with families, or, in groups) or via telephone counseling or online counseling (see also ). There have also been developments in computer-assisted therapy, such as virtual reality therapy for behavioral exposure, multimedia programs to teach cognitive techniques, and handheld devices for improved monitoring or putting ideas into practice (see also ).

Most forms of psychotherapy use spoken conversation. Some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, artwork, drama, narrative story or music. Psychotherapy with children and their parents often involves play, dramatization (i.e. role-play), and drawing, with a co-constructed narrative from these non-verbal and displaced modes of interacting.

== Regulation ==

Psychotherapists traditionally may be mental health professionals like psychologists and psychiatrists; professionals from other backgrounds (family therapists, social workers, nurses, etc.) who have trained in a specific psychotherapy; or (in some cases) academic or scientifically trained professionals. In addition to the training, many countries require psychotherapist to register with a professional body in order to be permitted to offer services.

Psychiatrists are trained first as physicians, and as such they may prescribe prescription medication; and specialist psychiatric training begins after medical school in psychiatric residencies: however, their specialty is in mental disorders or forms of mental illness. Clinical psychologists have specialist doctoral degrees in psychology with some clinical and research components. Other clinical practitioners, social workers, mental health counselors, pastoral counselors, and nurses with a specialization in mental health, also often conduct psychotherapy. Many of the wide variety of psychotherapy training programs and institutional settings are multi-professional. In most countries, psychotherapy training is completed at a postgraduate level, often at a master&#x27;s degree (or doctoral) level, over four years, with significant clinical supervision and clinical placements. Mental health professionals that choose to specialize in psychotherapeutic work also require a program of continuing professional education after basic professional training.

A listing of the extensive professional competencies of a European psychotherapist was developed by the European Association of Psychotherapy (EAP) in 2013.

As sensitive and deeply personal topics are often discussed during psychotherapy, therapists are expected, and usually legally bound, to respect client or patient confidentiality. The critical importance of client confidentiality—and the limited circumstances in which it may need to be broken for the protection of clients or others—is enshrined in the regulatory psychotherapeutic organizations&#x27; codes of ethical practice. Examples of when it is typically accepted to break confidentiality include when the therapist has knowledge that a child or elder is being physically abused; when there is a direct, clear and imminent threat of serious physical harm to self or to a specific individual. In some countries psychotherapists are required by law to be mandated reporters.

=== Europe ===
As of 2015, there are still a lot of variations between different European countries about the regulation and delivery of psychotherapy. Several countries have no regulation of the practice or no protection of the title. Some have a system of voluntary registration, with independent professional organizations, while other countries attempt to restrict the practice of psychotherapy to &#x27;mental health professionals&#x27; (psychologists and psychiatrists) with state-certified training. The titles that are protected also vary. The European Association for Psychotherapy (EAP) established the 1990 Strasbourg Declaration on Psychotherapy, which is dedicated to establishing an independent profession of psychotherapy in Europe, with pan-European standards. The EAP has already made significant contacts with the European Union &amp; European Commission towards this end.

Given that the European Union has a primary policy about the free movement of labor within Europe, European legislation can overrule national regulations that are, in essence, forms of restrictive practices.

In Germany, the practice of psychotherapy for adults is restricted to qualified psychologists and physicians (including psychiatrists) who have completed several years of specialist practical training and certification in psychotherapy. As psychoanalysis, psychodynamic therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy meet the requirements of German health insurance companies, mental health professionals regularly opt for one of these three specializations in their postgraduate training. For psychologists, this includes three years of full-time practical training (4,200 hours), encompassing a year-long internship at an accredited psychiatric institution, six months of clinical work at an outpatient facility, 600 hours of supervised psychotherapy in an outpatient setting, and at least 600 hours of theoretical seminars. Social workers may complete the specialist training for child and teenage clients. Similarly in Italy, the practice of psychotherapy is restricted to graduates in psychology or medicine who have completed four years of recognised specialist training. Sweden has a similar restriction on the title &quot;psychotherapist&quot;, which may only be used by professionals who have gone through a post-graduate training in psychotherapy and then applied for a licence, issued by the National Board of Health and Welfare.

Legislation in France restricts the use of the title &quot;psychotherapist&quot; to professionals on the National Register of Psychotherapists, which requires a training in clinical psychopathology and a period of internship which is only open to physicians or titulars of a master&#x27;s degree in psychology or psychoanalysis.

Austria and Switzerland (2011) have laws that recognize multi-disciplinary functional approaches.

In the United Kingdom, the government and Health and Care Professions Council considered mandatory legal registration but decided that it was best left to professional bodies to regulate themselves, so the Professional Standards Authority for Health and Social Care (PSA) launched an Accredited Voluntary Registers scheme. Counseling and psychotherapy are not protected titles in the United Kingdom. Counsellors and psychotherapists who have trained and qualify to a certain standard (usually a level 4 Diploma) can apply to be members of the professional bodies who are listed on the PSA Accredited Registers.

=== United States ===
In some states, counselors or therapists must be licensed to use certain words and titles on self-identification or advertising. In some other states, the restrictions on practice are more closely associated with the charging of fees. Licensing and regulation are performed by various states. Presentation of practice as licensed, but without such a license, is generally illegal. Without a license, for example, a practitioner cannot bill insurance companies. Information about state licensure of psychologists is provided by the American Psychological Association.

In addition to state laws, the American Psychological Association requires its members to adhere to its published &quot;Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct&quot;. The American Board of Professional Psychology examines and certifies &quot;psychologists who demonstrate competence in approved specialty areas in professional psychology&quot;.

=== Canada ===

Regulation of psychotherapy is in the jurisdiction of, and varies among, the provinces and territories.

In Quebec, psychotherapy is a regulated activity which is restricted to psychologists, medical doctors, and holders of a psychotherapy permit issued by the Ordre des psychologues du Québec, the Quebec order of psychologists. Members of certain specified professions, including social workers, couple and family therapists, occupational therapists, guidance counsellors, criminologists, sexologists, psychoeducators, and registered nurses may obtain a psychotherapy permit by completing certain educational and practice requirements; their professional oversight is provided by their own professional orders. Some other professionals who were practising psychotherapy before the current system came into force continue to hold psychotherapy permits alone.

On 1 July 2019, Ontario&#x27;s Missing Persons Act came into effect, with the purpose of giving police more power to investigate missing persons. It allows police to require (as opposed to permit) health professionals, including psychotherapists, to share otherwise confidential documents about their client, if there is reason to believe their client is missing. Some have expressed concern that this legislation undermines psychotherapy confidentiality and could be abused maliciously by police, while others have praised the act for how it respects privacy and includes checks and balances.

== History ==
Psychotherapy can be said to have been practiced through the ages, as medics, philosophers, spiritual practitioners and people in general used psychological methods to heal others.

In the Western tradition, by the 19th century, a moral treatment movement (then meaning morale or mental) developed based on non-invasive non-restraint therapeutic methods. Another influential movement was started by Franz Mesmer (1734–1815) and his student Armand-Marie-Jacques de Chastenet, Marquis of Puységur (1751–1825). Called Mesmerism or animal magnetism, it would have a strong influence on the rise of dynamic psychology and psychiatry as well as theories about hypnosis. In 1853, Walter Cooper Dendy introduced the term &quot;psycho-therapeia&quot; regarding how physicians might influence the mental states of patients and thus their bodily ailments, for example by creating opposing emotions to promote mental balance. Daniel Hack Tuke cited the term and wrote about &quot;psycho-therapeutics&quot; in 1872 in his book &quot;Illustrations of the Influence of the Mind upon the Body in Health and Disease&quot;, in which he also proposed making a science of animal magnetism. Hippolyte Bernheim and colleagues in the &quot;Nancy School&quot; developed the concept of &quot;psychotherapy&quot; in the sense of using the mind to heal the body through hypnotism, yet further. Charles Lloyd Tuckey&#x27;s 1889 work, &quot;Psycho-therapeutics, or Treatment by Hypnotism and Suggestion&quot; popularized the work of the Nancy School in English. Also in 1889 a clinic used the word in its title for the first time, when Frederik van Eeden and Albert Willem van Renterghem in Amsterdam renamed theirs &quot;Clinique de Psycho-thérapeutique Suggestive&quot; after visiting Nancy. During this time, travelling stage hypnosis became popular, and such activities added to the scientific controversies around the use of hypnosis in medicine. Also in 1892, at the second congress of experimental psychology, van Eeden attempted to take the credit for the term psychotherapy and to distance the term from hypnosis. In 1896, the German journal Zeitschrift für Hypnotismus, Suggestionstherapie, Suggestionslehre und verwandte psychologische Forschungen changed its name to Zeitschrift für Hypnotismus, Psychotherapie sowie andere psychophysiologische und psychopathologische Forschungen, which is probably the first journal to use the term. Thus psychotherapy initially meant &quot;the treatment of disease by psychic or hypnotic influence, or by suggestion&quot;.

Sigmund Freud visited the Nancy School and his early neurological practice involved the use of hypnotism. However following the work of his mentor Josef Breuer—in particular a case where symptoms appeared partially resolved by what the patient, Bertha Pappenheim, dubbed a &quot;talking cure&quot;—Freud began focusing on conditions that appeared to have psychological causes originating in childhood experiences and the unconscious mind. He went on to develop techniques such as free association, dream interpretation, transference and analysis of the id, ego and superego. His popular reputation as the father of psychotherapy was established by his use of the distinct term &quot;psychoanalysis&quot;, tied to an overarching system of theories and methods, and by the effective work of his followers in rewriting history. Many theorists, including Alfred Adler, Carl Jung, Karen Horney, Anna Freud, Otto Rank, Erik Erikson, Melanie Klein and Heinz Kohut, built upon Freud&#x27;s fundamental ideas and often developed their own systems of psychotherapy. These were all later categorized as &quot;psychodynamic&quot;, meaning anything that involved the psyche&#x27;s conscious/unconscious influence on external relationships and the self. Sessions tended to number into the hundreds over several years.

Behaviorism developed in the 1920s, and behavior modification as a therapy became popularized in the 1950s and 1960s. Notable contributors were Joseph Wolpe in South Africa, M.B. Shapiro and Hans Eysenck in Britain, and John B. Watson and B.F. Skinner in the United States. Behavioral therapy approaches relied on principles of operant conditioning, classical conditioning and social learning theory to bring about therapeutic change in observable symptoms. The approach became commonly used for phobias, as well as other disorders.

Some therapeutic approaches developed out of the European school of existential philosophy. Concerned mainly with the individual&#x27;s ability to develop and preserve a sense of meaning and purpose throughout life, major contributors to the field (e.g., Irvin Yalom, Rollo May) and Europe (Viktor Frankl, Ludwig Binswanger, Medard Boss, R.D.Laing, Emmy van Deurzen) attempted to create therapies sensitive to common &quot;life crises&quot; springing from the essential bleakness of human self-awareness, previously accessible only through the complex writings of existential philosophers (e.g., Søren Kierkegaard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Gabriel Marcel, Martin Heidegger, Friedrich Nietzsche). The uniqueness of the patient-therapist relationship thus also forms a vehicle for therapeutic inquiry. A related body of thought in psychotherapy started in the 1950s with Carl Rogers. Based also on the works of Abraham Maslow and his hierarchy of human needs, Rogers brought person-centered psychotherapy into mainstream focus. The primary requirement was that the client receive three core &quot;conditions&quot; from his counselor or therapist: unconditional positive regard, sometimes described as &quot;prizing&quot; the client&#x27;s humanity; congruence [authenticity/genuineness/transparency]; and empathic understanding. This type of interaction was thought to enable clients to fully experience and express themselves, and thus develop according to their innate potential. Others developed the approach, like Fritz and Laura Perls in the creation of Gestalt therapy, as well as Marshall Rosenberg, founder of Nonviolent Communication, and Eric Berne, founder of transactional analysis. Later these fields of psychotherapy would become what is known as humanistic psychotherapy today. Self-help groups and books became widespread.

During the 1950s, Albert Ellis originated rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT). Independently a few years later, psychiatrist Aaron T. Beck developed a form of psychotherapy known as cognitive therapy. Both of these included relatively short, structured and present-focused techniques aimed at identifying and changing a person&#x27;s beliefs, appraisals and reaction-patterns, by contrast with the more long-lasting insight-based approach of psychodynamic or humanistic therapies. Beck&#x27;s approach used primarily the socratic method, and links have been drawn between ancient stoic philosophy and these cognitive therapies.

Cognitive and behavioral therapy approaches were increasingly combined and grouped under the umbrella term cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the 1970s. Many approaches within CBT are oriented towards active/directive yet collaborative empiricism (a form of reality-testing), and assessing and modifying core beliefs and dysfunctional schemas. These approaches gained widespread acceptance as a primary treatment for numerous disorders. A &quot;third wave&quot; of cognitive and behavioral therapies developed, including acceptance and commitment therapy and dialectical behavior therapy, which expanded the concepts to other disorders and/or added novel components and mindfulness exercises. However the &quot;third wave&quot; concept has been criticized as not essentially different from other therapies and having roots in earlier ones as well. Counseling methods developed include solution-focused therapy and systemic coaching.

Postmodern psychotherapies such as narrative therapy and coherence therapy do not impose definitions of mental health and illness, but rather see the goal of therapy as something constructed by the client and therapist in a social context. Systemic therapy also developed, which focuses on family and group dynamics—and transpersonal psychology, which focuses on the spiritual facet of human experience. Other orientations developed in the last three decades include feminist therapy, brief therapy, somatic psychology, expressive therapy, applied positive psychology and the human givens approach. A survey of over 2,500 US therapists in 2006 revealed the most utilized models of therapy and the ten most influential therapists of the previous quarter-century.

== Psychotherapy documentation ==

=== Origin ===
The practice of documenting psychotherapy sessions originated in the late 19th century with early pioneers in psychoanalysis. Sigmund Freud, often referred to as the father of psychoanalysis, was known for his meticulous record-keeping, which he used to study patient progress and deepen his understanding of human psychology. In his correspondence with Wilhelm Fleiss, Freud described his habit of taking daily notes to track his patients&#x27; progress, and he sometimes shared his observations with colleagues to discuss emerging theories and techniques.

While Freud valued thorough documentation, he also recognized its potential drawbacks. In his &quot;Recommendations to Physicians Practicing Psycho-Analysis&quot;, he suggested a technique of &quot;evenly-suspended attention&quot; to avoid becoming overly focused on specific details during sessions, as he believed extensive note-taking could interfere with the therapeutic process. This tension between accurate documentation and the therapeutic relationship continued to shape early discussions on clinical documentation.

=== Standardization of psychotherapy notes ===
As the field of psychotherapy grew, standardized note-taking practices emerged to promote consistency and improve the quality of patient care. One major advancement was the introduction of SOAP notes in the 1960s, developed by Dr. Lawrence Weed to structure clinical notes in four categories: Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan. This framework became widely used in both medical and mental health settings, offering a structured yet flexible approach to documentation that supported clinical reasoning and treatment planning.

Progress notes also gained prominence in mental health, tracking clients’ clinical status and treatment progress across sessions. To meet the needs of different therapeutic approaches, formats like DAP (Data, Assessment, Plan) and BIRP (Behavior, Intervention, Response, Plan) were introduced. These standardized approaches enabled better communication between providers, facilitated treatment planning, and ensured accountability and continuity of care.

=== Digital transformation of psychotherapy documentation ===
The advent of digital tools in the late 20th and early 21st centuries transformed the documentation process in psychotherapy. Electronic health records (EHRs) introduced significant benefits, such as enhanced accessibility and organization of patient records. Despite initial concerns about privacy and data security, studies have found that EHRs can increase documentation completeness, which improves information sharing and, ultimately, the quality of patient care.

Digital note-taking also introduced new challenges, particularly in terms of maintaining the confidentiality and narrative depth that are essential to psychotherapy. Mental health professionals continue to explore best practices for balancing structured documentation with the more nuanced narrative elements that are critical in psychotherapy.

== Types ==
There are hundreds of psychotherapy approaches or schools of thought. By 1980 there were more than 250; by 1996 more than 450; and at the start of the 21st century there were over a thousand different named psychotherapies—some being minor variations while others are based on very different conceptions of psychology, ethics (how to live) or technique. In practice therapy is often not of one pure type but draws from a number of perspectives and schools—known as an integrative or eclectic approach. The importance of the therapeutic relationship, also known as therapeutic alliance, between client and therapist is often regarded as crucial to psychotherapy. Common factors theory addresses this and other core aspects thought to be responsible for effective psychotherapy.
Sigmund Freud (1856–1939), a Viennese neurologist who studied with Jean-Martin Charcot in 1885, is often considered the father of modern psychotherapy. His methods included analyzing his patient&#x27;s dreams in search of important hidden insights into their unconscious minds. Other major elements of his methods, which changed throughout the years, included identification of childhood sexuality, the role of anxiety as a manifestation of inner conflict, the differentiation of parts of the psyche (id, ego, superego), transference and countertransference (the patient&#x27;s projections onto the therapist, and the therapist&#x27;s emotional responses to that). Some of his concepts were too broad to be amenable to empirical testing and invalidation, and he was critiqued for this by Jaspers. Numerous major figures elaborated and refined Freud&#x27;s therapeutic techniques including Melanie Klein, Donald Winnicott, and others. Since the 1960s, however, the use of Freudian-based analysis for the treatment of mental disorders has declined substantially. Different types of psychotherapy have been created along with the advent of clinical trials to test them scientifically. These incorporate subjective treatments (after Beck), behavioral treatments (after Skinner and Wolpe) and additional time-constrained and centered structures, for example, interpersonal psychotherapy. In youth issue and in schizophrenia, the systems of family treatment hold esteem. A portion of the thoughts emerging from therapy are presently pervasive and some are a piece of the tool set of ordinary clinical practice. They are not just medications, they additionally help to understand complex conduct.

Therapy may address specific forms of diagnosable mental illness, or everyday problems in managing or maintaining interpersonal relationships or meeting personal goals. A course of therapy may happen before, during or after pharmacotherapy (e.g. taking psychiatric medication).

Psychotherapies are categorized in several different ways. A distinction can be made between those based on a medical model and those based on a humanistic model. In the medical model, the client is seen as unwell and the therapist employs their skill to help the client back to health. The extensive use of the DSM-IV, the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders in the United States is an example of a medically exclusive model. The humanistic or non-medical model in contrast strives to depathologise the human condition. The therapist attempts to create a relational environment conducive to experiential learning and help build the client&#x27;s confidence in their own natural process resulting in a deeper understanding of themselves. The therapist may see themselves as a facilitator/helper.

Another distinction is between individual one-to-one therapy sessions, and group psychotherapy, including couples therapy and family therapy.

Therapies are sometimes classified according to their duration; a small number of sessions over a few weeks or months may be classified as brief therapy (or short-term therapy), others, where regular sessions take place for years, may be classified as long-term.

Some practitioners distinguish between more &quot;uncovering&quot; (or &quot;depth&quot;) approaches and more &quot;supportive&quot; psychotherapy. Uncovering psychotherapy emphasizes facilitating the client&#x27;s insight into the roots of their difficulties. The best-known example is classical psychoanalysis. Supportive psychotherapy by contrast stresses strengthening the client&#x27;s coping mechanisms and often providing encouragement and advice, as well as reality-testing and limit-setting where necessary. Depending on the client&#x27;s issues and situation, a more supportive or more uncovering approach may be optimal.

=== Humanistic ===
These psychotherapies, also known as &quot;experiential&quot;, are based on humanistic psychology and emerged in reaction to both behaviorism and psychoanalysis, being dubbed the &quot;third force&quot;. They are primarily concerned with the human development and needs of the individual, with an emphasis on subjective meaning, a rejection of determinism, and a concern for positive growth rather than pathology. Some posit an inherent human capacity to maximize potential, &quot;the self-actualizing tendency&quot;; the task of therapy is to create a relational environment where this tendency might flourish. Humanistic psychology can, in turn, be rooted in existentialism—the belief that human beings can only find meaning by creating it. This is the goal of existential therapy. Existential therapy is in turn philosophically associated with phenomenology.

Person-centered therapy, also known as client-centered, focuses on the therapist showing openness, empathy and &quot;unconditional positive regard&quot;, to help clients express and develop their own self.

Humanistic Psychodrama (HPD) is based on the human image of humanistic psychology. So all rules and methods follow the axioms of humanistic psychology. The HPD sees itself as development-oriented psychotherapy and has completely moved away from the psychoanalytic catharsis theory.
Self-awareness and self-realization are essential aspects in the therapeutic process. Subjective experiences, feelings and thoughts and one&#x27;s own experiences are the starting point for a change or reorientation in experience and behavior in the direction of more self-acceptance and satisfaction. Dealing with the biography of the individual is closely related to the sociometry of the group.

Gestalt therapy, originally called &quot;concentration therapy&quot;, is an existential/experiential form that facilitates awareness in the various contexts of life, by moving from talking about relatively remote situations to action and direct current experience. Derived from various influences, including an overhaul of psychoanalysis, it stands on top of essentially four load-bearing theoretical walls: phenomenological method, dialogical relationship, field-theoretical strategies, and experimental freedom.

A briefer form of humanistic therapy is the human givens approach, introduced in 199899. It is a solution-focused intervention based on identifying emotional needs—such as for security, autonomy and social connection—and using various educational and psychological methods to help people meet those needs more fully or appropriately.

=== Insight-oriented ===
Insight-oriented psychotherapies focus on revealing or interpreting unconscious processes. Most commonly referring to psychodynamic therapy, of which psychoanalysis is the oldest and most intensive form, these applications of depth psychology encourage the verbalization of all the patient&#x27;s thoughts, including free associations, fantasies, and dreams, from which the analyst formulates the nature of the past and present unconscious conflicts which are causing the patient&#x27;s symptoms and character problems.

There are six main schools of psychoanalysis, which all influenced psychodynamic theory: Freudian, ego psychology, object relations theory, self psychology, interpersonal psychoanalysis, and relational psychoanalysis. Techniques for analytic group therapy have also developed.

=== Cognitive-behavioral ===
Behavior therapies use behavioral techniques, including applied behavior analysis (also known as behavior modification), to change maladaptive patterns of behavior to improve emotional responses, cognitions, and interactions with others. Functional analytic psychotherapy is one form of this approach. By nature, behavioral therapies are empirical (data-driven), contextual (focused on the environment and context), functional (interested in the effect or consequence a behavior ultimately has), probabilistic (viewing behavior as statistically predictable), monistic (rejecting mind-body dualism and treating the person as a unit), and relational (analyzing bidirectional interactions).

Cognitive therapy focuses directly on changing the thoughts, in order to improve the emotions and behaviors.

Cognitive behavioral therapy attempts to combine the above two approaches, focused on the construction and reconstruction of people&#x27;s cognitions, emotions and behaviors. Generally in CBT, the therapist, through a wide array of modalities, helps clients assess, recognize and deal with problematic and dysfunctional ways of thinking, emoting and behaving.

The concept of &quot;third wave&quot; psychotherapies reflects an influence of Eastern philosophy in clinical psychology, incorporating principles such as meditation into interventions such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, acceptance and commitment therapy, and dialectical behavior therapy for borderline personality disorder.

Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a relatively brief form of psychotherapy (deriving from both CBT and psychodynamic approaches) that has been increasingly studied and endorsed by guidelines for some conditions. It focuses on the links between mood and social circumstances, helping to build social skills and social support. It aims to foster adaptation to current interpersonal roles and situations.

Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is primarily deployed by therapists in the treatment of OCD. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) state that CBT drawing primarily on behavioral techniques (such as ERP) has the &quot;strongest evidence base&quot; among psychosocial interventions. By confronting feared scenarios (i.e., exposure) and refraining from performing rituals (i.e., responsive prevention), patients may gradually feel less distress in confronting feared stimuli, while also feeling less inclination to use rituals to relieve that distress. Typically, ERP is delivered in &quot;hierarchical fashion&quot;, meaning patients confront increasingly anxiety-provoking stimuli as they progress through a course of treatment.

Other types include reality therapy/choice theory, multimodal therapy, and therapies for specific disorders including PTSD therapies such as cognitive processing therapy, substance abuse therapies such as relapse prevention and contingency management; and co-occurring disorders therapies such as Seeking Safety.

=== Systemic ===
Systemic therapy seeks to address people not just individually, as is often the focus of other forms of therapy, but in relationship, dealing with the interactions of groups, their patterns and dynamics (includes family therapy and marriage counseling). Community psychology is a type of systemic psychology.

The term group therapy was first used around 1920 by Jacob L. Moreno, whose main contribution was the development of psychodrama, in which groups were used as both cast and audience for the exploration of individual problems by reenactment under the direction of the leader. The more analytic and exploratory use of groups in both hospital and out-patient settings was pioneered by a few European psychoanalysts who emigrated to the US, such as Paul Schilder, who treated severely neurotic and mildly psychotic out-patients in small groups at Bellevue Hospital, New York. The power of groups was most influentially demonstrated in Britain during the Second World War, when several psychoanalysts and psychiatrists proved the value of group methods for officer selection in the War Office Selection Boards. A chance to run an Army psychiatric unit on group lines was then given to several of these pioneers, notably Wilfred Bion and Rickman, followed by S. H. Foulkes, Main, and Bridger. The Northfield Hospital in Birmingham gave its name to what came to be called the two &quot;Northfield Experiments&quot;, which provided the impetus for the development since the war of both social therapy, that is, the therapeutic community movement, and the use of small groups for the treatment of neurotic and personality disorders. Today group therapy is used in clinical settings and in private practice settings.

=== Expressive ===
Expressive psychotherapy is a form of therapy that utilizes artistic expression (via improvisational, compositional, re-creative, and receptive experiences) as its core means of treating clients. Expressive psychotherapists use the different disciplines of the creative arts as therapeutic interventions. This includes the modalities dance therapy, drama therapy, art therapy, music therapy, writing therapy, among others. This may include techniques such as affect labeling. Expressive psychotherapists believe that often the most effective way of treating a client is through the expression of imagination in creative work and integrating and processing what issues are raised in the act.

=== Postmodernist ===
Also known as post-structuralist or constructivist. Narrative therapy gives attention to each person&#x27;s &quot;dominant story&quot; through therapeutic conversations, which also may involve exploring unhelpful ideas and how they came to prominence. Possible social and cultural influences may be explored if the client deems it helpful. Coherence therapy posits multiple levels of mental constructs that create symptoms as a way to strive for self-protection or self-realization. Feminist therapy does not accept that there is one single or correct way of looking at reality and therefore is considered a postmodernist approach.

=== Other ===
Transpersonal psychology addresses the client in the context of a spiritual understanding of consciousness. Positive psychotherapy (PPT) (since 1968) is a method in the field of humanistic and psychodynamic psychotherapy and is based on a positive image of humans, with a health-promoting, resource-oriented and conflict-centered approach.

Hypnotherapy is undertaken while a subject is in a state of hypnosis. Hypnotherapy is often applied in order to modify a subject&#x27;s behavior, emotional content, and attitudes, as well as a wide range of conditions including: dysfunctional habits, anxiety, stress-related illness, pain management, and personal development.

Psychedelic therapy are therapeutic practices involving psychedelic drugs, such as LSD, psilocybin, DMT, and MDMA. In psychedelic therapy, in contrast to conventional psychiatric medication taken by the patient regularly or as needed, patients generally remain in an extended psychotherapy session during the acute psychedelic activity with additional sessions both before and after in order to help integrate experiences with the psychedelics. Psychedelic therapy has been compared with the shamanic healing rituals of indigenous people. Researchers identified two main differences: the first is the shamanic belief that multiple realities exist and can be explored through altered states of consciousness, and second the belief that spirits encountered in dreams and visions are real. The charitable initiative Founders Pledge has written a research report on cost-effective giving opportunities for funding psychedelic-assisted mental health treatments.

Body psychotherapy, part of the field of somatic psychology, focuses on the link between the mind and the body and tries to access deeper levels of the psyche through greater awareness of the physical body and emotions. There are various &quot;body-oriented&quot; approaches, such as Reichian (Wilhelm Reich) character-analytic vegetotherapy and orgonomy; neo-Reichian bioenergetic analysis; somatic experiencing; integrative body psychotherapy; Ron Kurtz&#x27;s Hakomi psychotherapy; sensorimotor psychotherapy; Biosynthesis psychotherapy; and Biodynamic psychotherapy. These approaches are not to be confused with body work or body-therapies that seek to improve primarily physical health through direct work (touch and manipulation) on the body, rather than through directly psychological methods.

Some non-Western indigenous therapies have been developed. In African countries this includes harmony restoration therapy, meseron therapy and systemic therapies based on the Ubuntu philosophy.

Integrative psychotherapy is an attempt to combine ideas and strategies from more than one theoretical approach. These approaches include mixing core beliefs and combining proven techniques. Forms of integrative psychotherapy include multimodal therapy, the transtheoretical model, cyclical psychodynamics, systematic treatment selection, cognitive analytic therapy, internal family systems model, multitheoretical psychotherapy and conceptual interaction. In practice, most experienced psychotherapists develop their own integrative approach over time.

=== Child ===
Psychotherapy needs to be adapted to meet the developmental needs of children. Depending on age, it is generally held to be one part of an effective strategy to help the needs of a child within the family setting. Child psychotherapy training programs necessarily include courses in human development. Since children often do not have the ability to articulate thoughts and feelings, psychotherapists will use a variety of media such as musical instruments, sand and toys, crayons, paint, clay, puppets, bibliocounseling (books), or board games. The use of play therapy is often rooted in psychodynamic theory, but other approaches also exist.

In addition to therapy for the child, sometimes instead of it, children may benefit if their parents work with a therapist, take parenting classes, attend grief counseling, or take other action to resolve stressful situations that affect the child. Parent management training is a highly effective form of psychotherapy that teaches parenting skills to reduce their child&#x27;s behavior problems.

In many cases a different psychotherapist will work with the care taker of the child, while a colleague works with the child. Therefore, contemporary thinking on working with the younger age group has leaned towards working with parent and child simultaneously, as well as individually as needed.

== Computer-supported ==
Research on computer-supported and computer-based interventions has increased significantly over the course of the last two decades. The following applications frequently have been investigated:

* Virtual reality: VR is a computer-generated scenario that simulates experience. The immersive environment, used for simulated exposure, can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical, creating a new experience.
* Computer-based interventions (or &quot;online interventions&quot; or &quot;internet interventions&quot;): These interventions can be described as interactive self-help. They usually entail a combination of text, audio or video elements.
* Computer-supported therapy (or &quot;blended therapy&quot;): Classical psychotherapy is supported by means of online or software application elements. The feasibility of such interventions has been investigated for individual and group therapy.

=== Efficacy ===
There is considerable controversy about whether, or when, psychotherapy efficacy is best evaluated by randomized controlled trials or more individualized idiographic methods.

One issue with trials is what to use as a placebo treatment group or non-treatment control group. Often, this group includes patients on a waiting list, or those receiving some kind of regular non-specific contact or support. Researchers must consider how best to match the use of inert tablets or sham treatments in placebo-controlled studies in pharmaceutical trials. Several interpretations and differing assumptions and language remain. Another issue is the attempt to standardize and manualize therapies and link them to specific symptoms of diagnostic categories, making them more amenable to research. Some report that this may reduce efficacy or gloss over individual needs. Fonagy and Roth&#x27;s opinion is that the benefits of the evidence-based approach outweighs the difficulties.

There are several formal frameworks for evaluating whether a psychotherapist is a good fit for a patient. One example is the Scarsdale Psychotherapy Self-Evaluation (SPSE). However, some scales, such as the SPS, elicit information specific to certain schools of psychotherapy alone (e.g. the superego).

Many psychotherapists believe that the nuances of psychotherapy cannot be captured by questionnaire-style observation, and prefer to rely on their own clinical experiences and conceptual arguments to support the type of treatment they practice. Psychodynamic therapists increasingly believe that evidence-based approaches are appropriate to their methods and assumptions, and have increasingly accepted the challenge to implement evidence-based approaches in their methods.

A pioneer in investigating the results of different psychological therapies was psychologist Hans Eysenck, who argued that psychotherapy does not produce any improvement in patients. He held that behavior therapy is the only effective one. However, it was revealed that Eysenck (who died in 1997) falsified data in his studies about this subject, fabricating data that would indicate that behavioral therapy enables achievements that are impossible to believe. Fourteen of his papers were retracted by journals in 2020, and journals issued 64 statements of concern about publications by him. Rod Buchanan, a biographer of Eysenck, has argued that 87 publications by Eysenck should be retracted.

The response rate of psychotherapy varies, no reliable changes due to psychotherapy can be found in up to 33% of patients.

==== Comparison with other treatments ====
Large-scale international reviews of scientific studies have concluded that psychotherapy is effective for numerous conditions. A 2022 meta-analysis of meta-analyses found that effect sizes reported for both psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies, compared to treatment-as-usual or placebo, were small for most disorders and treatments, and concluded that a &quot;paradigm shift in research&quot; was needed to advance the field and improve treatment strategies for mental disorders.

One line of research consistently found that supposedly different forms of psychotherapy show similar effectiveness. According to the 2008 edition of &quot;The Handbook of Counseling Psychology&quot;: &quot;Meta-analyses of psychotherapy studies have consistently demonstrated that there are no substantial differences in outcomes among treatments&quot;. The handbook stated that &quot;little evidence suggests that any one treatment consistently outperforms any other for any specific psychological disorders&quot;. This is sometimes called the Dodo bird verdict after a scene/section in Alice in Wonderland where every competitor in a race was called a winner and is given prizes.

Further analyses seek to identify the factors that the psychotherapies have in common that seem to account for this, known as common factors theory; for example the quality of the therapeutic relationship, interpretation of problem, and the confrontation of painful emotions.

Outcome studies have been critiqued for being too removed from real-world practice in that they use carefully selected therapists who have been extensively trained and monitored, and patients who may be non-representative of typical patients by virtue of strict inclusionary/exclusionary criteria. Such concerns impact the replication of research results and the ability to generalize from them to practicing therapists.

However, specific therapies have been tested for use with specific disorders, and regulatory organizations in both the UK and US make recommendations for different conditions.

The Helsinki Psychotherapy Study was one of several large long-term clinical trials of psychotherapies that have taken place. Anxious and depressed patients in two short-term therapies (solution-focused and brief psychodynamic) improved faster, but five years long-term psychotherapy and psychoanalysis gave greater benefits. Several patient and therapist factors appear to predict suitability for different psychotherapies.

Meta-analyses have established that cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic psychotherapy are equally effective in treating depression.

A 2014 meta analysis over 11,000 patients reveals that Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) is of comparable effectiveness to CBT for depression but is inferior to the latter for eating disorders. For children and adolescents, interpersonal psychotherapy and CBT are the best methods according to a 2014 meta analysis of almost 4000 patients.

=== Adverse effects ===
Research on adverse effects of psychotherapy has been limited, yet worsening of symptoms may be expected to occur in 3% to 15% of patients, with variability across patient and therapist characteristics. Potential problems include deterioration of symptoms or developing new symptoms, strains in other relationships, social stigma, and therapy dependence. Some techniques or therapists may carry more risks than others, and some client characteristics may make them more vulnerable. Side-effects from properly conducted therapy should be distinguished from harms caused by malpractice.

=== Adherence ===
Patient adherence to a course of psychotherapy—continuing to attend sessions or complete tasks—is a major issue.

The dropout level—early termination—ranges from around 30% to 60%, depending partly on how it is defined. The range is lower for research settings for various reasons, such as the selection of clients and how they are inducted. Early termination is associated on average with various demographic and clinical characteristics of clients, therapists and treatment interactions. The high level of dropout has raised some criticism about the relevance and efficacy of psychotherapy.

Most psychologists use between-session tasks in their general therapy work, and cognitive behavioral therapies in particular use and see them as an &quot;active ingredient&quot;. It is not clear how often clients do not complete them, but it is thought to be a pervasive phenomenon.

From the other side, the adherence of therapists to therapy protocols and techniques—known as &quot;treatment integrity&quot; or &quot;fidelity&quot;—has also been studied, with complex mixed results. In general, however, it is a hallmark of evidence-based psychotherapy to use fidelity monitoring as part of therapy outcome trials and ongoing quality assurance in clinical implementation.

=== Mechanisms of change ===
It is not yet understood how psychotherapies can succeed in treating mental illnesses. Different therapeutic approaches may be associated with particular theories about what needs to change in a person for a successful therapeutic outcome.

In general, processes of emotional arousal and memory have long been held to play an important role. One theory combining these aspects proposes that permanent change occurs to the extent that the neuropsychological mechanism of memory reconsolidation is triggered and is able to incorporate new emotional experiences.

=== General critiques ===
Some critics are skeptical of the healing power of psychotherapeutic relationships. Some dismiss psychotherapy altogether in the sense of a scientific discipline requiring professional practitioners, instead favoring either nonprofessional help or biomedical treatments. Others have pointed out ways in which the values and techniques of therapists can be harmful as well as helpful to clients (or indirectly to other people in a client&#x27;s life).

Many resources available to a person experiencing emotional distress—the friendly support of friends, peers, family members, clergy contacts, personal reading, healthy exercise, research, and independent coping—all present considerable value. Critics note that humans have been dealing with crises, navigating severe social problems and finding solutions to life problems long before the advent of psychotherapy.

On the other hand, some argue psychotherapy is under-utilized and under-researched by contemporary psychiatry despite offering more promise than stagnant medication development. In 2015, the US National Institute of Mental Health allocated only 5.4% of its budget to new clinical trials of psychotherapies (medication trials are largely funded by pharmaceutical companies), despite plentiful evidence they can work and that patients are more likely to prefer them.

Further critiques have emerged from feminist, constructionist and discourse-analytical sources. Key to these is the issue of power. In this regard there is a concern that clients are persuaded—both inside and outside the consulting room—to understand themselves and their difficulties in ways that are consistent with therapeutic ideas. This means that alternative ideas (e.g., feminist, economic, spiritual) are sometimes implicitly undermined. Critics suggest that we idealize the situation when we think of therapy only as a helping relationship—arguing instead that it is fundamentally a political practice, in that some cultural ideas and practices are supported while others are undermined or disqualified, and that while it is seldom intended, the therapist–client relationship always participates in society&#x27;s power relations and political dynamics. A noted academic who espoused this criticism was Michel Foucault.

<text>Polywater was a hypothesized polymerized form of water that was the subject of much scientific controversy during the late 1960s, first described by Soviet scientist Nikolai Fedyakin. By 1969 the popular press had taken notice of Western attempts to recreate the substance and sparked fears of a &quot;polywater gap&quot; between the United States and Soviet Union. Increased press attention also brought with it increased scientific attention, and as early as 1970 doubts about its authenticity were being circulated. By 1973 it was found to be illusory, being just water with any number of common compounds contaminating it. Today, polywater is best known as an example of pathological science.

==Background==
In 1961, the Soviet physicist Nikolai Fedyakin, working at the Technological Institute of Kostroma, Russia, performed measurements on the properties of water which had been condensed in, or repeatedly forced through, narrow quartz capillary tubes. Some of these experiments resulted in what was seemingly a new form of water with a higher boiling point, lower freezing point, and much higher viscosity than ordinary water – about that of a syrup.

Boris Derjaguin, director of the laboratory for surface physics at the Institute for Physical Chemistry in Moscow, heard about Fedyakin&#x27;s experiments. He improved on the method to produce the new water, and though he still produced very small quantities of this mysterious material, he did so substantially faster than Fedyakin did. Investigations of the material properties showed a substantially lower freezing point of −40 °C or less, a boiling point of 150 °C or greater, a density of approx. 1.1 to 1.2 g/cm3, and increased expansion with increasing temperature. The results were published in Soviet science journals, and short summaries were published in &quot;Chemical Abstracts&quot; in English, but Western scientists took no notice of the work.

In 1966, Derjaguin travelled to England for the &quot;Discussions of the Faraday Society&quot; in Nottingham. There, he presented the work again, and this time English scientists took note of what he referred to as &quot;anomalous water&quot;. English scientists then started researching the effect as well, and by 1968 it was also under study in the United States.

By 1969, the concept had spread to newspapers and magazines. There was fear by the United States military that there was a so-called &quot;polywater gap&quot; with the Soviet Union, a popular media term indicating a possible capability &quot;gap&quot;, or discrepancy, between the US and the USSR, popularized by media hype of the &quot;bomber gap&quot; and the &quot;missile gap&quot;, during periods when the USSR appeared to be outstripping the US in numbers of these various weapons.

A scientific furore followed. Some experiments carried out were able to reproduce Derjaguin&#x27;s findings, while others failed. Several theories were advanced to explain the phenomenon. Some proposed it was the cause for increasing resistance on trans-Atlantic phone cables, while others predicted that if polywater were to contact ordinary water, it would convert that water into polywater, echoing the doomsday scenario in Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s novel &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;. By the 1970s, polywater was well known in the general population.

During this time, several people questioned the authenticity of what had come to be known in the West as polywater. The main concern was contamination of the water, but the papers went to great lengths to note the care taken to avoid this. Denis Rousseau and Sergio Porto of Bell Labs carried out infrared spectrum analysis, which showed polywater to be mostly chlorine and sodium.

Denis Rousseau undertook an experiment with his own sweat after playing a handball game at the lab and found it had identical properties. He then published a paper suggesting polywater was nothing more than water with small amounts of biological impurities.

Another wave of research followed, this time more tightly controlled. Invariably, polywater could no longer be made. Chemical analysis found the samples of polywater to be contaminated with other substances (explaining the changes in melting and boiling points due to colligative properties), and examination of polywater by electron microscopy showed it also contained small particles of various solids – from silica to phospholipids, explaining its greater viscosity.

When the experiments which had initially produced polywater were repeated with thoroughly cleaned glassware, the anomalous properties of the resulting water vanished, and even the scientists who had originally advanced the case for polywater agreed it did not exist.

In August 1973, Derjaguin and N. V. Churaev published a letter in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; in which they wrote; &quot;these [anomalous] properties should be attributed to impurities rather than to the existence of polymeric water molecules&quot;.

Denis Rousseau used polywater as a classic example of pathological science and has since written on other examples as well.

It has been suggested that polywater should have been dismissed on theoretical grounds. The laws of thermodynamics predicted that, since polywater had a higher boiling point than ordinary water, it meant it was more stable, and thus all of Earth&#x27;s water should have turned spontaneously into polywater, instead of just part of it. Richard Feynman remarked that if such a material existed, then an animal would exist that would ingest water and excrete polywater, using the energy released from the process to survive.

==In fiction==
The episodes &quot;The Naked Time&quot; (&quot;Star Trek&quot;, 1966) and its sequel, &quot;The Naked Now&quot; (&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, 1987) involve forms of polywater intoxication. In the original episode, a scientific research outpost falls victim to polywater, which causes the crew to become so incapacitated that they all died after shutting off environmental controls in the compound. In the sequel, a Starfleet vessel is discovered adrift, its crew frozen in various states due to polywater intoxication. The &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; episode &quot;I, Excretus&quot; briefly features a simulated version of the USS &quot;Cerritos&quot; plagued by polywater intoxication, leading to a shipwide orgy, as part of a holodeck drill. Beckett Mariner attempts the simulation, but is unable to stomach the scenario and chooses to eject herself from an airlock.

The story &quot;Polywater Doodle&quot; by Howard L. Myers appeared in the February 1971 issue of &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;. It features an animal composed entirely of polywater, with the metabolism described by Richard Feynman. (The title of the story is a pun on &quot;Polly Wolly Doodle&quot;.)

Polywater is the central idea of the 1972 espionage/thriller novel &quot;A Report from Group 17&quot; by Robert C. O&#x27;Brien. The story revolves around the use of a type of polywater to make people controllable and incapable of independent thought or action.

==Business==

There is a company named American Polywater Corporation, which is unrelated to the hypothesized form of water. The company is based in Stillwater, Minnesota.

<doc id="24935" wikidata="Q2056830" url="?curid=24935" title="Pathological science">
<text>Pathological science is an area of research where &quot;people are tricked into false results ... by subjective effects, wishful thinking or threshold interactions.&quot; The term was first used by Irving Langmuir, Nobel Prize-winning chemist, during a 1953 at the Knolls Research Laboratory. Langmuir said a pathological science is an area of research that simply will not &quot;go away&quot;—long after it was given up on as &quot;false&quot; by the majority of scientists in the field. He called pathological science &quot;the science of things that aren&#x27;t so.&quot;

In his 2002 book, &quot;Undead Science&quot;, sociology and anthropology Professor Bart Simon lists it among practices that are falsely perceived or presented to be science, &quot;categories ... such as ... pseudoscience, amateur science, deviant or fraudulent science, bad science, junk science, pathological science, cargo cult science, and voodoo science.&quot; Examples of pathological science include the Martian canals, N-rays, polywater, and cold fusion. The theories and conclusions behind all of these examples are currently rejected or disregarded by the majority of scientists.

==Definition==

Pathological science, as defined by Langmuir, is a psychological process in which a scientist, originally conforming to the scientific method, unconsciously veers from that method, and begins a pathological process of wishful data interpretation . Some characteristics of pathological science are:
* The maximum effect that is observed is produced by a causative agent of barely detectable intensity, and the magnitude of the effect is substantially independent of the intensity of the cause.
* The effect is of a magnitude that remains close to the limit of detectability, or many measurements are necessary because of the very low statistical significance of the results.
* There are claims of great accuracy.
* Fantastic theories contrary to experience are suggested.
* Criticisms are met by ad hoc excuses.
* The ratio of supporters to critics rises and then falls gradually to oblivion.
Langmuir never intended the term to be rigorously defined; it was simply the title of his talk on some examples of &quot;weird science&quot;. As with any attempt to define the scientific endeavor, examples and counterexamples can always be found.

==Langmuir&#x27;s examples==
===N-rays===
Langmuir&#x27;s discussion of N-rays has led to their traditional characterization as an instance of pathological science.

In 1903, Prosper-René Blondlot was working on X-rays (as were many physicists of the era) and noticed a new visible radiation that could penetrate aluminium. He devised experiments in which a barely visible object was illuminated by these N-rays, and thus became &quot;more visible&quot;. Blondlot claimed that N-rays were causing a small visual reaction, too small to be seen under normal illumination, but just visible when most normal light sources were removed and the target was just barely visible to begin with.

N-rays became the topic of some debate within the science community. After a time, American physicist Robert W. Wood decided to visit Blondlot&#x27;s lab, which had moved on to the physical characterization of N-rays. An experiment passed the rays from a 2 mm slit through an aluminum prism, from which he was measuring the index of refraction to a precision that required measurements accurate to within 0.01 mm. Wood asked how it was possible that he could measure something to 0.01 mm from a 2 mm source, a physical impossibility in the propagation of any kind of wave. Blondlot replied, &quot;That&#x27;s one of the fascinating things about the N-rays. They don&#x27;t follow the ordinary laws of science that you ordinarily think of.&quot; Wood then asked to see the experiments being run as usual, which took place in a room required to be very dark so the target was barely visible. Blondlot repeated his most recent experiments and got the same results—despite the fact that Wood had reached over and covertly sabotaged the N-ray apparatus by removing the prism.

===Other examples===
Langmuir offered additional examples of what he regarded as pathological science in his original speech:
* The Davis–Barnes effect (1929; after Professor Bergen Davis from Columbia University)
* Mitogenetic rays (1923; Alexander Gurwitsch and others)
* The Allison effect (1927; after Fred Allison). (b) (c) (d) (e) 
* Extrasensory perception (1934), where Rhine consciously discarded contrary test results because he felt they could not be correct.

===Later examples===
A 1985 version of Langmuir&#x27;s speech offered more examples, although at least one of these (polywater) occurred entirely after Langmuir&#x27;s death in 1957:
* Water dowsing
* Martian canals (Observed in late 19th century and early 20th century, they turned out to be optical illusions.)
* Certain reported photomechanical and electromechanical effects 
* Polywater
* Biological effects of magnetic fields (see magnetobiology and magnet therapy) except magnetoception

==Newer examples==
Since Langmuir&#x27;s original talk, a number of newer examples of what appear to be pathological science have appeared. Denis Rousseau, one of the main debunkers of polywater, gave an update of Langmuir in 1992, and he specifically cited as examples the cases of polywater, Martin Fleischmann&#x27;s cold fusion and Jacques Benveniste&#x27;s &quot;infinite dilution&quot;.

===Polywater===
Polywater was a form of water which appeared to have a much higher boiling point and much lower freezing point than normal water. During the 1960s, many articles were published on the subject, and research on polywater was done around the world with mixed results. Eventually it was determined that many of the properties of polywater could be explained by biological contamination. When more rigorous cleaning of glassware and experimental controls were introduced, polywater could no longer be produced. It took several years for the concept of polywater to die in spite of the later negative results.

===Cold fusion===
In 1989, Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons announced the discovery of a simple and cheap procedure to obtain room-temperature nuclear fusion. Although there were many instances where successful results were reported, they lacked consistency and hence cold fusion came to be considered to be an example of pathological science. Two panels convened by the US Department of Energy, one in 1989 and a second in 2004, did not recommend a dedicated federal program for cold fusion research. A small number of researchers continue working in the field.

Jacques Benveniste was a French immunologist who in 1988 published a paper in the prestigious scientific journal &quot;Nature&quot; describing the action of very high dilutions of anti-IgE antibody on the degranulation of human basophils, findings which seemed to support the concept of homeopathy. Biologists were puzzled by Benveniste&#x27;s results, as only molecules of water, and no molecules of the original antibody, remained in these high dilutions. Benveniste concluded that the configuration of molecules in water was biologically active. Subsequent investigations have not supported Benveniste&#x27;s findings.

<text>Pneumatic tubes (or capsule pipelines, also known as pneumatic tube transport or PTT) are systems that propel cylindrical containers through networks of tubes by compressed air or by partial vacuum. They are used for transporting solid objects, as opposed to conventional pipelines which transport fluids. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, pneumatic tube networks gained acceptance in offices that needed to transport small, urgent packages, such as mail, other paperwork, or money, over relatively short distances, within a building or, at most, within a city. Some installations became quite complex, but have mostly been superseded. However, they have been further developed in the 21st century in places such as hospitals, to send blood samples and the like to clinical laboratories for analysis.

A small number of pneumatic transportation systems were built for larger cargo, to compete with train and subway systems. However, they never gained popularity.

== History ==

=== Historical use ===
Pneumatic transportation was invented by William Murdoch around 1799. &quot;Capsule pipelines&quot; were first used in the Victorian era, to transmit telegrams from telegraph stations to nearby buildings. The system is known as pneumatic dispatch.

In 1854, Josiah Latimer Clark was issued a patent &quot;for conveying letters or parcels between places by the pressure of air and vacuum&quot;. In 1853, he installed a pneumatic system between the London Stock Exchange in Threadneedle Street, London, and the offices of the Electric Telegraph Company in Lothbury. The Electric Telegraph Company used the system to acquire stock prices and other financial information to pass to subscribers of their service over their telegraph wires. The advantage of the pneumatic system was that, without it, the company would have had to employ runners to carry messages between the two buildings, or else employ trained telegraph operators within the Stock Exchange. In the mid-1860s, the company installed similar systems to local stock exchanges in Liverpool, Birmingham, and Manchester. After the telegraphs were nationalised in Britain, the pneumatic system continued to be expanded under Post Office Telegraphs. That expansion was due to Joseph William Willmot (previously employed at the Electric &amp; International Telegraph Company) improving Latimer-Clark&#x27;s invention in 1870 with the &quot;double sluice pneumatic valve&quot; and, in 1880, the &quot;intermediate signaller/quick break switch for pneumatic tubes&quot;, which dramatically sped up the process, and made it possible for a number of carrier messages to be in the tube at any one time. By 1880, there were over of tube in London. A tube was laid between the Aberdeen fish market office and the main post office, to facilitate the rapid sale of the very perishable commodity.

While they are commonly used for small parcels and documents, including cash carriers at banks or supermarkets, in the early 19th century, they were proposed for transport of heavy freight. It was once envisaged that networks of massive tubes might be used to transport people.

=== Contemporary use ===
The technology is still used on a smaller scale. While its use for communicating information has been superseded by electronics, pneumatic tubes are widely used for transporting small objects, where convenience and speed in a local environment are important.

In the United States, drive-up banks often used pneumatic tubes to transport cash and documents between cars and tellers; by the 2020s some of these have been removed, obviated by the rise of mobile banking apps and the increasing sophistication of ATMs. Many hospitals have a computer-controlled pneumatic tube system to deliver drugs, documents, and specimens to and from laboratories and nurses&#x27; stations. Many factories use them to deliver parts quickly across large campuses. Many larger stores use systems to securely transport excess cash from checkout stands to back offices, and to send change back to cashiers. They are used in casinos to move money, chips, and cards quickly and securely. Japanese love hotels use them to allow customers to settle bills anonymously (no face-to-face contact). NASA&#x27;s original Mission Control Center had pneumatic tubes connecting controller consoles with staff support rooms. Mission Operations Control Room 2, was last used in its original configuration in 1992 and then remodeled for other missions. Because the room was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1985, it was decided in 2017 to restore it to its 1960s condition. The pneumatic tubes were removed and sent to the Cosmosphere in Kansas for restoration.
Pneumatic tube systems have been used in nuclear chemistry to transport samples during neutron activation analysis. Samples must be moved from the nuclear reactor core, in which they are bombarded with neutrons, to the instrument that measures the resulting radiation. As some of the radioactive isotopes in the sample can have very short half-lives, speed is important. These systems may be automated, with a magazine of sample tubes that are moved into the reactor core in turn for a predetermined time, before being moved to the instrument station and finally to a container for storage and disposal.

Until it closed in early 2011, a McDonald&#x27;s in Edina, Minnesota claimed to be the &quot;World&#x27;s Only Pneumatic Air Drive-Thru,&quot; sending food from their strip-mall location to a drive-through in the middle of a parking lot.

Technology editor Quentin Hardy noted renewed interest in transmission of data by pneumatic tube accompanied discussions of digital network security, and he cited research into London&#x27;s forgotten pneumatic network.

Related applications include fish cannons which use mechanisms very similar to pneumatic tube systems.
==Applications==

===In postal service===

Pneumatic post or pneumatic mail is a system to deliver letters through pressurized air tubes. It was invented by the Scottish engineer William Murdoch in the 19th century and was later developed by the London Pneumatic Despatch Company. Pneumatic post systems were used in several large cities starting in the second half of the 19th century (including an 1866 London system powerful and large enough to transport humans during trial runs – though not intended for that purpose), but later were largely abandoned.

A major network of tubes in Paris (the Paris pneumatic post) was in use until 1984, when it was abandoned in favor of computers and fax machines. The Prague pneumatic post commenced for the public in 1889 in Prague, now in the Czech Republic, and the network extended approximately .

Pneumatic post stations usually connect post offices, stock exchanges, banks and ministries. Italy was the only country to issue postage stamps (between 1913 and 1966) specifically for pneumatic post. Austria, France, and Germany issued postal stationery for pneumatic use.

Typical applications are in banks, hospitals, and supermarkets. Many large retailers used pneumatic tubes to transport cheques or other documents from cashiers to the accounting office.

===In public transportation===
;19th century
In 1812, George Medhurst first proposed, but never implemented, blowing passenger carriages through a tunnel. Precursors of pneumatic tube systems for passenger transport, the atmospheric railway (for which the tube was laid between the rails, with a piston running in it suspended from the train through a sealable slot in the top of the tube) were operated as follows:
* 1844–54: Dublin and Kingstown Railway&#x27;s Dalkey Atmospheric Railway between Kingstown (Dún Laoghaire) and Dalkey, Ireland ()
* 1846–47: London and Croydon Railway between Croydon and New Cross, London, England ()
* 1847–48: Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s South Devon Railway between Exeter and Newton Abbot, England ()
* 1847–60: Paris–Saint-Germain railway between Bois de Vésinet and Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France ()

In 1861, the &quot;London Pneumatic Despatch Company&quot; built a system large enough to move a person, although it was intended for parcels. The inauguration of the new Holborn Station on 10 October 1865 was marked by having the Duke of Buckingham, the chairman, and some company directors blown through the tube to Euston (a five-minute trip).
The Crystal Palace pneumatic railway was exhibited at the Crystal Palace in 1864. This was a prototype for a proposed &quot;Waterloo and Whitehall Railway&quot; that would have run under the River Thames linking Waterloo and Charing Cross. Digging commenced in 1865 but was halted in 1868 due to financial problems.

In 1867 at the American Institute Fair in New York, Alfred Ely Beach demonstrated a long, diameter pipe that was capable of moving 12 passengers plus a conductor. One year after New York City&#x27;s first-ever elevated rail line went into service; in 1869, the Beach Pneumatic Transit Company of New York secretly constructed a long, diameter pneumatic subway line under Broadway, to demonstrate the possibilities of the new transport mode. The line only operated for a few months, closing after Beach was unsuccessful in getting permission to extend it – Boss Tweed, a corrupt influential politician, did not want it to go ahead as he was intending to personally invest into competing schemes for an elevated rail line.

; 20th century
In the 1920s, the Canadian Pacific and Canadian National Railways cooperated together to lay an elaborate system of 4,500 metre pneumatic tubing between four of their offices to Postal Station A at Union Station in Toronto, Canada. There was also a connection to the mail room at the Royal York Hotel. The newspapers the Star and Telegram joined into the system, laying pipes.
In the 1960s, Lockheed and MIT with the United States Department of Commerce conducted feasibility studies on a vactrain system powered by ambient atmospheric pressure and &quot;gravitational pendulum assist&quot; to connect cities on the country&#x27;s East Coast. They calculated that the run between Philadelphia and New York City would average 174 meters per second, that is 626 km/h (388 mph). When those plans were abandoned as too expensive, Lockheed engineer L.K. Edwards founded Tube Transit, Inc. to develop technology based on &quot;gravity-vacuum transportation&quot;. In 1967 he proposed a &quot;Bay Area Gravity-Vacuum Transit&quot; for California that would run alongside the then-under construction BART system. It was never built.

; 21st century
Research into trains running in partially evacuated tubes, such as the Vactrain and Hyperloop, is continuing.

===Pneumatic elevator===
A pneumatic elevator consists of a cylindrical vertical shaft (typically made of transparent plastic), and a passenger capsule (also transparent) within the shaft which moves vertically by means of differential air pressure above and below. The main advantage that it requires neither a pit below or a loft above the shaft.

For ascending operations, a vacuum pump at the top of the elevator shaft creates a low pressure by drawing air from above the capsule while below the greater normal atmospheric pressure is permitted to enter at the lower (ground floor) level below the capsule providing lift.

To descend, electronically controlled valves inside the tubular shaft regulate the entry and exit of air within the cylinder lowering the car smoothly by means of programmed operation. In the event of a failure of the vacuum pump or electronically controlled valves, the trapped volume of air below the capsule acts as a cushion that is allowed to slowly escape by means of a mechanical valve, gently returning the capsule to the lowest level.

===In money transfer===
In large retail stores, pneumatic tube systems were used to transport sales slips and money from the salesperson to a centralized tube room, where cashiers could make change, reference credit records, and so on.

Many banks with drive-throughs also use pneumatic tubes.

===In medicine===
Many hospitals have pneumatic tube systems which send samples to laboratories. Blood preservations are transported, where weight and transport duration matter as well as preventing haemolysis caused by centrifugal and accelerating forces. Pneumatic tube systems are also used in hospitals to transport X-rays, patient documents, general documents, drugs and test results.

 pneumatic tube systems have been shown to handle heavy liter-capacity IV bags with significantly fewer jams compared to the systems.

===Department stores===
To manage its mail order business the department store Sears built &quot;massive warehouses, like its central facility in Chicago, in which messages to various departments and assembly workers were sent through pneumatic tubes&quot;. Many other department stores had pneumatic tube systems in the 20th century, such as Jacksons of Reading and Myer in Melbourne, Australia. The National Library of Australia&#x27;s building (opened 1968), incorporates a pneumatic tube system for sending book requests from the reading rooms to the book stacks. The system is no longer used, but remains partially operational, and is demonstrated on behind the scenes tours.

=== Waste disposal ===

The use of pneumatic tubes in waste disposal units include the Masjid al-Haram, Mecca, GlashusEtt in the Hammarby Sjöstad area of Stockholm (Sweden), Old Montreal (Canada), Disney World (US) and Roosevelt Island and Hudson Yards (US).

===In production===
Pneumatic tube systems are used in production plants. Uses include conveying spare parts, measuring instruments, tools, or work pieces alongside conveyor belts or in the production process. In industrial laboratories samples are transported through the pneumatic tube systems. These can be conveyed in any physical state (solid, liquid, gas) and at any temperature. For example, the industrial company ThyssenKrupp sends steel samples through pneumatic tubes at a rate of per second from the furnace to the laboratory.

==Technical characteristics==

Modern systems (for smaller, i.e. “normal”, tube diameters as used in the transport of small capsules) reach speeds of around per second, though some historical systems already achieved speeds of per second. At the same time, varying air pressures allow capsules to brake slowly, removing the jarring arrival that used to characterise earlier systems and make them unsuitable for fragile contents.

Very powerful systems can transport items with a weight of up to and a diameter of up to . More than 100 lines and 1000 stations can be connected.

Further, modern systems can be computer-controlled for tracking of any specific capsule and managing priority deliveries as well as system efficiency. With this technology, time-critical items can be transported, such as tissue samples taken during a surgery in a hospital. RFID chips within the capsules gather data – e. g. about the location of the carrier, its transport speed or its destination. The systems collect and save these data to help users optimize their internal processes and turnaround times. The facilities can be linked to the company&#x27;s software systems, e.g. laboratory information systems, for full integration into company logistical management and production chains.

<doc id="24942" wikidata="Q223375" url="?curid=24942" title="Patrilineality">
<text>Patrilineality, also known as the male line, the spear side or agnatic kinship, is a common kinship system in which an individual&#x27;s family membership derives from and is recorded through their father&#x27;s lineage. It generally involves the inheritance of property, rights, names, or titles by persons related through male kin. This is sometimes distinguished from cognate kinship, through the mother&#x27;s lineage, also called the spindle side or the distaff side.

A patriline (&quot;father line&quot;) is a person&#x27;s father, and additional ancestors, as traced only through males.

==In the Bible==
In the Bible, family and tribal membership appears to be transmitted through the father. For example, a person is considered to be a priest or Levite, if his father is a priest or Levite, and the members of all the Twelve Tribes are called Israelites because their father is Israel (Jacob).

In the first lines of the New Testament, the descent of Jesus Christ from King David is counted through the male lineage.

==Agnatic succession==
Patrilineal or agnatic succession gives priority to or restricts inheritance of a throne or fief to male heirs descended from the original title holder through males only. Traditionally, agnatic succession is applied in determining the names and membership of European dynasties. The prevalent forms of dynastic succession in Europe, Asia and parts of Africa were male-preference primogeniture, agnatic primogeniture, or agnatic seniority until after World War II. The agnatic succession model, also known as Salic law, meant the total exclusion of women as hereditary monarchs and restricted succession to thrones and inheritance of fiefs or land to men in parts of medieval and later Europe. This form of strict agnatic inheritance has been officially revoked in all extant European monarchies except the Principality of Liechtenstein.

By the 21st century, most ongoing European monarchies had replaced their traditional agnatic succession with absolute primogeniture, meaning that the first child born to a monarch inherits the throne, regardless of the child&#x27;s sex.

==Genetic genealogy==

The fact that human Y-chromosome DNA (Y-DNA) is paternally inherited enables patrilines and agnatic kinships of men to be traced through genetic analysis.

Y-chromosomal Adam (Y-MRCA) is the patrilineal most recent common ancestor from whom all Y-DNA in living men is descended. An identification of a very rare and previously unknown Y-chromosome variant in 2012 led researchers to estimate that Y-chromosomal Adam lived 338,000 years ago (237,000 to 581,000 years ago with 95% confidence), judging from molecular clock and genetic marker studies. Before this discovery, estimates of the date when Y-chromosomal Adam lived were much more recent, estimated to be tens of thousands of years.

<text>Plate tectonics (, ) is the scientific theory that the Earth&#x27;s lithosphere comprises a number of large tectonic plates, which have been slowly moving since 3–4 billion years ago. The model builds on the concept of , an idea developed during the first decades of the 20th century. Plate tectonics came to be accepted by geoscientists after seafloor spreading was validated in the mid-to-late 1960s. The processes that result in plates and shape Earth&#x27;s crust are called &quot;tectonics&quot;.
Tectonic plates also occur in other planets and moons.

Earth&#x27;s lithosphere, the rigid outer shell of the planet including the crust and upper mantle, is fractured into seven or eight major plates (depending on how they are defined) and many minor plates or &quot;platelets&quot;. Where the plates meet, their relative motion determines the type of plate boundary (or fault): , , or . The relative movement of the plates typically ranges from zero to 10 cm annually. Faults tend to be geologically active, experiencing earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation.

Tectonic plates are composed of the oceanic lithosphere and the thicker continental lithosphere, each topped by its own kind of crust. Along convergent plate boundaries, the process of subduction carries the edge of one plate down under the other plate and into the mantle. This process reduces the total surface area (crust) of the Earth. The lost surface is balanced by the formation of new oceanic crust along divergent margins by seafloor spreading, keeping the total surface area constant in a tectonic &quot;conveyor belt&quot;.

Tectonic plates are relatively rigid and float across the ductile asthenosphere beneath. Lateral density variations in the mantle result in convection currents, the slow creeping motion of Earth&#x27;s solid mantle. At a seafloor spreading ridge, plates move away from the ridge, which is a topographic high, and the newly formed crust cools as it moves away, increasing its density and contributing to the motion. At a subduction zone, the relatively cold, dense oceanic crust sinks down into the mantle, forming the downward convecting limb of a mantle cell, which is the strongest driver of plate motion. The relative importance and interaction of other proposed factors such as active convection, upwelling inside the mantle, and tidal drag of the Moon is still the subject of debate.

== Key principles ==
The outer layers of Earth are divided into the lithosphere and asthenosphere. The division is based on differences in mechanical properties and in the method for the transfer of heat. The lithosphere is cooler and more rigid, while the asthenosphere is hotter and flows more easily. In terms of heat transfer, the lithosphere loses heat by conduction, whereas the asthenosphere also transfers heat by convection and has a nearly adiabatic temperature gradient. This division should not be confused with the &quot;chemical&quot; subdivision of these same layers into the mantle (comprising both the asthenosphere and the mantle portion of the lithosphere) and the crust: a given piece of mantle may be part of the lithosphere or the asthenosphere at different times depending on its temperature and pressure.

The key principle of plate tectonics is that the lithosphere exists as separate and distinct tectonic plates, which ride on the fluid-like solid the asthenosphere. Plate motions range from at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (about as fast as fingernails grow), to about for the Nazca plate (about as fast as hair grows).

Tectonic lithosphere plates consist of lithospheric mantle overlain by one or two types of crustal material: oceanic crust (in older texts called &quot;sima&quot; from silicon and magnesium) and continental crust (&quot;sial&quot; from silicon and aluminium). The distinction between oceanic crust and continental crust is based on their modes of formation. Oceanic crust is formed at sea-floor spreading centers. Continental crust is formed through arc volcanism and accretion of terranes through plate tectonic processes. Oceanic crust is denser than continental crust because it has less silicon and more of the heavier elements than continental crust. As a result of this density difference, oceanic crust generally lies below sea level, while continental crust buoyantly projects above sea level.

Average oceanic lithosphere is typically thick. Its thickness is a function of its age. As time passes, it cools by conducting heat from below, and releasing it raditively into space. The adjacent mantle below is cooled by this process and added to its base. Because it is formed at mid-ocean ridges and spreads outwards, its thickness is therefore a function of its distance from the mid-ocean ridge where it was formed. For a typical distance that oceanic lithosphere must travel before being subducted, the thickness varies from about thick at mid-ocean ridges to greater than at subduction zones. For shorter or longer distances, the subduction zone, and therefore also the mean, thickness becomes smaller or larger, respectively. Continental lithosphere is typically about thick, though this varies considerably between basins, mountain ranges, and stable cratonic interiors of continents.

The location where two plates meet is called a &quot;plate boundary&quot;. Plate boundaries are where geological events occur, such as earthquakes and the creation of topographic features such as mountains, volcanoes, mid-ocean ridges, and oceanic trenches. The vast majority of the world&#x27;s active volcanoes occur along plate boundaries, with the Pacific plate&#x27;s Ring of Fire being the most active and widely known. Some volcanoes occur in the interiors of plates, and these have been variously attributed to internal plate deformation and to mantle plumes.

Tectonic plates may include continental crust or oceanic crust, or both. For example, the African plate includes the continent and parts of the floor of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.

Some pieces of oceanic crust, known as ophiolites, failed to be subducted under continental crust at destructive plate boundaries; instead these oceanic crustal fragments were pushed upward and were preserved within continental crust.

== Types of plate boundaries ==
Three types of plate boundaries exist, characterized by the way the plates move relative to each other. They are associated with different types of surface phenomena. The different types of plate boundaries are:
* &quot;Divergent boundaries&quot; (&quot;constructive boundaries&quot; or &quot;extensional boundaries&quot;). These are where two plates slide apart from each other. At zones of ocean-to-ocean rifting, divergent boundaries form by seafloor spreading, allowing for the formation of new ocean basin, e.g. the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and East Pacific Rise. As the ocean plate splits, the ridge forms at the spreading center, the ocean basin expands, and finally, the plate area increases causing many small volcanoes and/or shallow earthquakes. At zones of continent-to-continent rifting, divergent boundaries may cause new ocean basin to form as the continent splits, spreads, the central rift collapses, and ocean fills the basin, e.g., the East African Rift, the Baikal Rift, the West Antarctic Rift, the Rio Grande Rift.
* &quot;Convergent boundaries&quot; (&quot;destructive boundaries&quot; or &quot;active margins&quot;) occur where two plates slide toward each other to form either a subduction zone (one plate moving underneath the other) or a continental collision. 
:Subduction zones are of two types: ocean-to-continent subduction, where the dense oceanic lithosphere plunges beneath the less dense continent, or ocean-to-ocean subduction where older, cooler, denser oceanic crust slips beneath less dense oceanic crust. Deep marine trenches are typically associated with subduction zones, and the basins that develop along the active boundary are often called &quot;foreland basins&quot;. 
:Earthquakes trace the path of the downward-moving plate as it descends into asthenosphere, a trench forms, and as the subducted plate is heated it releases volatiles, mostly water from hydrous minerals, into the surrounding mantle. The addition of water lowers the melting point of the mantle material above the subducting slab, causing it to melt. The magma that results typically leads to volcanism. 
:At zones of ocean-to-ocean subduction a deep trench to forms in an arc shape. The upper mantle of the subducted plate then heats and magma rises to form curving chains of volcanic islands e.g. the Aleutian Islands, the Mariana Islands, the Japanese island arc. 
:At zones of ocean-to-continent subduction mountain ranges form, e.g. the Andes, the Cascade Range.
:At continental collision zones there are two masses of continental lithosphere converging. Since they are of similar density, neither is subducted. The plate edges are compressed, folded, and uplifted forming mountain ranges, e.g. Himalayas and Alps. Closure of ocean basins can occur at continent-to-continent boundaries.
* &quot;Transform boundaries&quot; (&quot;conservative boundaries&quot; or &quot; strike-slip boundaries&quot;) occur where plates are neither created nor destroyed. Instead two plates slide, or perhaps more accurately grind past each other, along transform faults. The relative motion of the two plates is either sinistral (left side toward the observer) or dextral (right side toward the observer). Transform faults occur across a spreading center. Strong earthquakes can occur along a fault. The San Andreas Fault in California is an example of a transform boundary exhibiting dextral motion.
* Other &quot;plate boundary zones&quot; occur where the effects of the interactions are unclear, and the boundaries, usually occurring along a broad belt, are not well defined and may show various types of movements in different episodes.

== Driving forces of plate motion ==
Tectonic plates are able to move because of the relative density of oceanic lithosphere and the relative weakness of the asthenosphere. Dissipation of heat from the mantle is the original source of the energy required to drive plate tectonics through convection or large scale upwelling and doming. As a consequence, a powerful source generating plate motion is the excess density of the oceanic lithosphere sinking in subduction zones. When the new crust forms at mid-ocean ridges, this oceanic lithosphere is initially less dense than the underlying asthenosphere, but it becomes denser with age as it conductively cools and thickens. The greater density of old lithosphere relative to the underlying asthenosphere allows it to sink into the deep mantle at subduction zones, providing most of the driving force for plate movement. The weakness of the asthenosphere allows the tectonic plates to move easily towards a subduction zone.

=== Driving forces related to mantle dynamics ===

For much of the first quarter of the 20th century, the leading theory of the driving force behind tectonic plate motions envisaged large scale convection currents in the upper mantle, which can be transmitted through the asthenosphere. This theory was launched by Arthur Holmes and some forerunners in the 1930s and was immediately recognized as the solution for the acceptance of the theory as originally discussed in the papers of Alfred Wegener in the early years of the 20th century. However, despite its acceptance, it was long debated in the scientific community because the leading theory still envisaged a static Earth without moving continents up until the major breakthroughs of the early sixties.

Two- and three-dimensional imaging of Earth&#x27;s interior (seismic tomography) shows a varying lateral density distribution throughout the mantle. Such density variations can be material (from rock chemistry), mineral (from variations in mineral structures), or thermal (through thermal expansion and contraction from heat energy). The manifestation of this varying lateral density is mantle convection from buoyancy forces.

How mantle convection directly and indirectly relates to plate motion is a matter of ongoing study and discussion in geodynamics. Somehow, this energy must be transferred to the lithosphere for tectonic plates to move. There are essentially two main types of mechanisms that are thought to exist related to the dynamics of the mantle that influence plate motion which are primary (through the large scale convection cells) or secondary. The secondary mechanisms view plate motion driven by friction between the convection currents in the asthenosphere and the more rigid overlying lithosphere. This is due to the inflow of mantle material related to the downward pull on plates in subduction zones at ocean trenches. Slab pull may occur in a geodynamic setting where basal tractions continue to act on the plate as it dives into the mantle (although perhaps to a greater extent acting on both the under and upper side of the slab). Furthermore, slabs that are broken off and sink into the mantle can cause viscous mantle forces driving plates through slab suction.

==== Plume tectonics ====
In the theory of plume tectonics followed by numerous researchers during the 1990s, a modified concept of mantle convection currents is used. It asserts that super plumes rise from the deeper mantle and are the drivers or substitutes of the major convection cells. These ideas find their roots in the early 1930s in the works of Beloussov and van Bemmelen, which were initially opposed to plate tectonics and placed the mechanism in a fixed frame of vertical movements. Van Bemmelen later modified the concept in his &quot;Undation Models&quot; and used &quot;Mantle Blisters&quot; as the driving force for horizontal movements, invoking gravitational forces away from the regional crustal doming.

The theories find resonance in the modern theories which envisage hot spots or mantle plumes which remain fixed and are overridden by oceanic and continental lithosphere plates over time and leave their traces in the geological record (though these phenomena are not invoked as real driving mechanisms, but rather as modulators).

The mechanism is still advocated to explain the break-up of supercontinents during specific geological epochs. It has followers amongst the scientists involved in the theory of Earth expansion.

==== Surge tectonics ====
Another theory is that the mantle flows neither in cells nor large plumes but rather as a series of channels just below Earth&#x27;s crust, which then provide basal friction to the lithosphere. This theory, called &quot;surge tectonics&quot;, was popularized during the 1980s and 1990s. Recent research, based on three-dimensional computer modelling, suggests that plate geometry is governed by a feedback between mantle convection patterns and the strength of the lithosphere.

=== Driving forces related to gravity ===
Forces related to gravity are invoked as secondary phenomena within the framework of a more general driving mechanism such as the various forms of mantle dynamics described above. In modern views, gravity is invoked as the major driving force, through slab pull along subduction zones.

Gravitational sliding away from a spreading ridge is one of the proposed driving forces, it proposes plate motion is driven by the higher elevation of plates at ocean ridges. As oceanic lithosphere is formed at spreading ridges from hot mantle material, it gradually cools and thickens with age (and thus adds distance from the ridge). Cool oceanic lithosphere is significantly denser than the hot mantle material from which it is derived and so with increasing thickness it gradually subsides into the mantle to compensate the greater load. The result is a slight lateral incline with increased distance from the ridge axis.

This force is regarded as a secondary force and is often referred to as &quot;ridge push&quot;. This is a misnomer as there is no force &quot;pushing&quot; horizontally, indeed tensional features are dominant along ridges. It is more accurate to refer to this mechanism as &quot;gravitational sliding&quot;, since the topography across the whole plate can vary considerably and spreading ridges are only the most prominent feature. Other mechanisms generating this gravitational secondary force include flexural bulging of the lithosphere before it dives underneath an adjacent plate, producing a clear topographical feature that can offset, or at least affect, the influence of topographical ocean ridges. Mantle plumes and hot spots are also postulated to impinge on the underside of tectonic plates.

Slab pull: Scientific opinion is that the asthenosphere is insufficiently competent or rigid to directly cause motion by friction along the base of the lithosphere. Slab pull is therefore most widely thought to be the greatest force acting on the plates. In this understanding, plate motion is mostly driven by the weight of cold, dense plates sinking into the mantle at trenches. Recent models indicate that trench suction plays an important role as well. However, the fact that the North American plate is nowhere being subducted, although it is in motion, presents a problem. The same holds for the African, Eurasian, and Antarctic plates.

Gravitational sliding away from mantle doming: According to older theories, one of the driving mechanisms of the plates is the existence of large scale asthenosphere/mantle domes which cause the gravitational sliding of lithosphere plates away from them (see the paragraph on Mantle Mechanisms). This gravitational sliding represents a secondary phenomenon of this basically vertically oriented mechanism. It finds its roots in the Undation Model of van Bemmelen. This can act on various scales, from the small scale of one island arc up to the larger scale of an entire ocean basin.

=== Driving forces related to Earth rotation ===
Alfred Wegener, being a meteorologist, had proposed tidal forces and centrifugal forces as the main driving mechanisms behind continental drift; however, these forces were considered far too small to cause continental motion as the concept was of continents plowing through oceanic crust. Therefore, Wegener later changed his position and asserted that convection currents are the main driving force of plate tectonics in the last edition of his book in 1929.

However, in the plate tectonics context (accepted since the seafloor spreading proposals of Heezen, Hess, Dietz, Morley, Vine, and Matthews (see below) during the early 1960s), the oceanic crust is suggested to be in motion &quot;with&quot; the continents which caused the proposals related to Earth rotation to be reconsidered. In more recent literature, these driving forces are:
# Tidal drag due to the gravitational force the Moon (and the Sun) exerts on the crust of Earth
# Global deformation of the geoid due to small displacements of the rotational pole with respect to Earth&#x27;s crust
# Other smaller deformation effects of the crust due to wobbles and spin movements of Earth&#x27;s rotation on a smaller timescale

Forces that are small and generally negligible are:

# The Coriolis force
# The centrifugal force, which is treated as a slight modification of gravity

For these mechanisms to be overall valid, systematic relationships should exist all over the globe between the orientation and kinematics of deformation and the geographical latitudinal and longitudinal grid of Earth itself. These systematic relations studies in the second half of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century underline exactly the opposite: that the plates had not moved in time, that the deformation grid was fixed with respect to Earth&#x27;s equator and axis, and that gravitational driving forces were generally acting vertically and caused only local horizontal movements (the so-called pre-plate tectonic, &quot;fixist theories&quot;). Later studies (discussed below on this page), therefore, invoked many of the relationships recognized during this pre-plate tectonics period to support their theories (see reviews of these various mechanisms related to Earth rotation the work of van Dijk and collaborators).

==== Possible tidal effect on plate tectonics ====
Of the many forces discussed above, tidal force is still highly debated and defended as a possible principal driving force of plate tectonics. The other forces are only used in global geodynamic models not using plate tectonics concepts (therefore beyond the discussions treated in this section) or proposed as minor modulations within the overall plate tectonics model.
In 1973, George W. Moore of the USGS and R. C. Bostrom presented evidence for a general westward drift of Earth&#x27;s lithosphere with respect to the mantle, based on the steepness of the subduction zones (shallow dipping towards the east, steeply dipping towards the west). They concluded that tidal forces (the tidal lag or &quot;friction&quot;) caused by Earth&#x27;s rotation and the forces acting upon it by the Moon are a driving force for plate tectonics. As Earth spins eastward beneath the Moon, the Moon&#x27;s gravity ever so slightly pulls Earth&#x27;s surface layer back westward, just as proposed by Alfred Wegener (see above). Since 1990 this theory is mainly advocated by Doglioni and co-workers , such as in a more recent 2006 study, where scientists reviewed and advocated these ideas. It has been suggested in that this observation may also explain why Venus and Mars have no plate tectonics, as Venus has no moon and Mars&#x27; moons are too small to have significant tidal effects on the planet. In a paper by Torsvik et al., it was suggested that, on the other hand, it can easily be observed that many plates are moving north and eastward, and that the dominantly westward motion of the Pacific Ocean basins derives simply from the eastward bias of the Pacific spreading center (which is not a predicted manifestation of such lunar forces). In the same paper the authors admit, however, that relative to the lower mantle, there is a slight westward component in the motions of all the plates. They demonstrated though that the westward drift, seen only for the past 30 Ma, is attributed to the increased dominance of the steadily growing and accelerating Pacific plate. The debate is still open, and a recent paper by Hofmeister et al. (2022) revived the idea advocating again the interaction between the Earth&#x27;s rotation and the Moon as main driving forces for the plates.

===Role of water===
The role of water has been proposed to be crucial in plate tectonics on Earth.

=== Relative significance of each driving force mechanism ===
The vector of a plate&#x27;s motion is a function of all the forces acting on the plate; however, therein lies the problem regarding the degree to which each process contributes to the overall motion of each tectonic plate.

The diversity of geodynamic settings and the properties of each plate result from the impact of the various processes actively driving each individual plate. One method of dealing with this problem is to consider the relative rate at which each plate is moving as well as the evidence related to the significance of each process to the overall driving force on the plate.

One of the most significant correlations discovered to date is that lithospheric plates attached to downgoing (subducting) plates move much faster than other types of plates. The Pacific plate, for instance, is essentially surrounded by zones of subduction (the so-called Ring of Fire) and moves much faster than the plates of the Atlantic basin, which are attached (perhaps one could say &#x27;welded&#x27;) to adjacent continents instead of subducting plates. It is thus thought that forces associated with the downgoing plate (slab pull and slab suction) are the driving forces which determine the motion of plates, except for those plates which are not being subducted. This view however has been contradicted by a recent study which found that the actual motions of the Pacific plate and other plates associated with the East Pacific Rise do not correlate mainly with either slab pull or slab push, but rather with a mantle convection upwelling whose horizontal spreading along the bases of the various plates drives them along via viscosity-related traction forces. The driving forces of plate motion continue to be active subjects of on-going research within geophysics and tectonophysics.

== History of the theory ==
=== Summary ===

The development of the theory of plate tectonics was the scientific and cultural change which occurred during a period of 50 years of scientific debate. The event of the acceptance itself was a paradigm shift and can therefore be classified as a scientific revolution, now described as the Plate Tectonics Revolution.

Around the start of the twentieth century, various theorists unsuccessfully attempted to explain the many geographical, geological, and biological continuities between continents. In 1912, the meteorologist Alfred Wegener described what he called continental drift, an idea that culminated fifty years later in the modern theory of plate tectonics.

Wegener expanded his theory in his 1915 book &quot;The Origin of Continents and Oceans&quot;. Starting from the idea (also expressed by his forerunners) that the present continents once formed a single land mass (later called Pangaea), Wegener suggested that these separated and drifted apart, likening them to &quot;icebergs&quot; of low density sial floating on a sea of denser sima. Supporting evidence for the idea came from the dove-tailing outlines of South America&#x27;s east coast and Africa&#x27;s west coast Antonio Snider-Pellegrini had drawn on his maps, and from the matching of the rock formations along these edges. Confirmation of their previous contiguous nature also came from the fossil plants &quot;Glossopteris&quot; and &quot;Gangamopteris&quot;, and the therapsid or mammal-like reptile &quot;Lystrosaurus&quot;, all widely distributed over South America, Africa, Antarctica, India, and Australia. The evidence for such an erstwhile joining of these continents was patent to field geologists working in the southern hemisphere. The South African Alex du Toit put together a mass of such information in his 1937 publication &quot;Our Wandering Continents&quot;, and went further than Wegener in recognising the strong links between the Gondwana fragments.

Wegener&#x27;s work was initially not widely accepted, in part due to a lack of detailed evidence but mostly because of the lack of a reasonable physically supported mechanism. Earth might have a solid crust and mantle and a liquid core, but there seemed to be no way that portions of the crust could move around. Many distinguished scientists of the time, such as Harold Jeffreys and Charles Schuchert, were outspoken critics of continental drift.

Despite much opposition, the view of continental drift gained support and a lively debate started between &quot;drifters&quot; or &quot;mobilists&quot; (proponents of the theory) and &quot;fixists&quot; (opponents). During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the former reached important milestones proposing that convection currents might have driven the plate movements, and that spreading may have occurred below the sea within the oceanic crust. Concepts close to the elements of plate tectonics were proposed by geophysicists and geologists (both fixists and mobilists) like Vening-Meinesz, Holmes, and Umbgrove. In 1941, Otto Ampferer described, in his publication &quot;Thoughts on the motion picture of the Atlantic region&quot;, processes that anticipated seafloor spreading and subduction. One of the first pieces of geophysical evidence that was used to support the movement of lithospheric plates came from paleomagnetism. This is based on the fact that rocks of different ages show a variable magnetic field direction, evidenced by studies since the mid–nineteenth century. The magnetic north and south poles reverse through time, and, especially important in paleotectonic studies, the relative position of the magnetic north pole varies through time. Initially, during the first half of the twentieth century, the latter phenomenon was explained by introducing what was called &quot;polar wander&quot; (see apparent polar wander) (i.e., it was assumed that the north pole location had been shifting through time). An alternative explanation, though, was that the continents had moved (shifted and rotated) relative to the north pole, and each continent, in fact, shows its own &quot;polar wander path&quot;. During the late 1950s, it was successfully shown on two occasions that these data could show the validity of continental drift: by Keith Runcorn in a paper in 1956, and by Warren Carey in a symposium held in March 1956.

The second piece of evidence in support of continental drift came during the late 1950s and early 60s from data on the bathymetry of the deep ocean floors and the nature of the oceanic crust such as magnetic properties and, more generally, with the development of marine geology which gave evidence for the association of seafloor spreading along the mid-oceanic ridges and magnetic field reversals, published between 1959 and 1963 by Heezen, Dietz, Hess, Mason, Vine &amp; Matthews, and Morley.

Simultaneous advances in early seismic imaging techniques in and around Wadati–Benioff zones along the trenches bounding many continental margins, together with many other geophysical (e.g., gravimetric) and geological observations, showed how the oceanic crust could disappear into the mantle, providing the mechanism to balance the extension of the ocean basins with shortening along its margins.

All this evidence, both from the ocean floor and from the continental margins, made it clear around 1965 that continental drift was feasible. The theory of plate tectonics was defined in a series of papers between 1965 and 1967. The theory revolutionized the Earth sciences, explaining a diverse range of geological phenomena and their implications in other studies such as paleogeography and paleobiology.

=== Continental drift ===

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, geologists assumed that Earth&#x27;s major features were fixed, and that most geologic features such as basin development and mountain ranges could be explained by vertical crustal movement, described in what is called the geosynclinal theory. Generally, this was placed in the context of a contracting planet Earth due to heat loss in the course of a relatively short geological time.

It was observed as early as 1596 that the opposite coasts of the Atlantic Ocean—or, more precisely, the edges of the continental shelves—have similar shapes and seem to have once fitted together.

Since that time many theories were proposed to explain this apparent complementarity, but the assumption of a solid Earth made these various proposals difficult to accept.

The discovery of radioactivity and its associated heating properties in 1895 prompted a re-examination of the apparent age of Earth. This had previously been estimated by its cooling rate under the assumption that Earth&#x27;s surface radiated like a black body. Those calculations had implied that, even if it started at red heat, Earth would have dropped to its present temperature in a few tens of millions of years. Armed with the knowledge of a new heat source, scientists realized that Earth would be much older, and that its core was still sufficiently hot to be liquid.

By 1915, after having published a first article in 1912, Alfred Wegener was making serious arguments for the idea of continental drift in the first edition of &quot;The Origin of Continents and Oceans&quot;. In that book (re-issued in four successive editions up to the final one in 1936), he noted how the east coast of South America and the west coast of Africa looked as if they were once attached. Wegener was not the first to note this (Abraham Ortelius, Antonio Snider-Pellegrini, Eduard Suess, Roberto Mantovani and Frank Bursley Taylor preceded him just to mention a few), but he was the first to marshal significant fossil and paleo-topographical and climatological evidence to support this simple observation (and was supported in this by researchers such as Alex du Toit). Furthermore, when the rock strata of the margins of separate continents are very similar it suggests that these rocks were formed in the same way, implying that they were joined initially. For instance, parts of Scotland and Ireland contain rocks very similar to those found in Newfoundland and New Brunswick. Furthermore, the Caledonian Mountains of Europe and parts of the Appalachian Mountains of North America are very similar in structure and lithology.

However, his ideas were not taken seriously by many geologists, who pointed out that there was no apparent mechanism for continental drift. Specifically, they did not see how continental rock could plow through the much denser rock that makes up oceanic crust. Wegener could not explain the force that drove continental drift, and his vindication did not come until after his death in 1930.

=== Floating continents, paleomagnetism, and seismicity zones ===

As it was observed early that although granite existed on continents, seafloor seemed to be composed of denser basalt, the prevailing concept during the first half of the twentieth century was that there were two types of crust, named &quot;sial&quot; (continental type crust) and &quot;sima&quot; (oceanic type crust). Furthermore, it was supposed that a static shell of strata was present under the continents. It therefore looked apparent that a layer of basalt (sial) underlies the continental rocks.

However, based on abnormalities in plumb line deflection by the Andes in Peru, Pierre Bouguer had deduced that less-dense mountains must have a downward projection into the denser layer underneath. The concept that mountains had &quot;roots&quot; was confirmed by George B. Airy a hundred years later, during study of Himalayan gravitation, and seismic studies detected corresponding density variations. Therefore, by the mid-1950s, the question remained unresolved as to whether mountain roots were clenched in surrounding basalt or were floating on it like an iceberg.

During the 20th century, improvements in and greater use of seismic instruments such as seismographs enabled scientists to learn that earthquakes tend to be concentrated in specific areas, most notably along the oceanic trenches and spreading ridges. By the late 1920s, seismologists were beginning to identify several prominent earthquake zones parallel to the trenches that typically were inclined 40–60° from the horizontal and extended several hundred kilometers into Earth. These zones later became known as Wadati–Benioff zones, or simply Benioff zones, in honor of the seismologists who first recognized them, Kiyoo Wadati of Japan and Hugo Benioff of the United States. The study of global seismicity greatly advanced in the 1960s with the establishment of the Worldwide Standardized Seismograph Network (WWSSN) to monitor the compliance of the 1963 treaty banning above-ground testing of nuclear weapons. The much improved data from the WWSSN instruments allowed seismologists to map precisely the zones of earthquake concentration worldwide.

Meanwhile, debates developed around the phenomenon of polar wander. Since the early debates of continental drift, scientists had discussed and used evidence that polar drift had occurred because continents seemed to have moved through different climatic zones during the past. Furthermore, paleomagnetic data had shown that the magnetic pole had also shifted during time. Reasoning in an opposite way, the continents might have shifted and rotated, while the pole remained relatively fixed. The first time the evidence of magnetic polar wander was used to support the movements of continents was in a paper by Keith Runcorn in 1956, and successive papers by him and his students Ted Irving (who was actually the first to be convinced of the fact that paleomagnetism supported continental drift) and Ken Creer.

This was immediately followed by a symposium on continental drift in Tasmania in March 1956 organised by S. Warren Carey who had been one of the supporters and promotors of Continental Drift since the thirties During this symposium, some of the participants used the evidence in the theory of an expansion of the global crust, a theory which had been proposed by other workers decades earlier. In this hypothesis, the shifting of the continents is explained by a large increase in the size of Earth since its formation. However, although the theory still has supporters in science, this is generally regarded as unsatisfactory because there is no convincing mechanism to produce a significant expansion of Earth. Other work during the following years would soon show that the evidence was equally in support of continental drift on a globe with a stable radius.

During the 1930s up to the late 1950s, works by Vening-Meinesz, Holmes, Umbgrove, and numerous others outlined concepts that were close or nearly identical to modern plate tectonics theory. In particular, the English geologist Arthur Holmes proposed in 1920 that plate junctions might lie beneath the sea, and in 1928 that convection currents within the mantle might be the driving force. Often, these contributions are forgotten because:
* At the time, continental drift was not accepted.
* Some of these ideas were discussed in the context of abandoned fixist ideas of a deforming globe without continental drift or an expanding Earth.
* They were published during an episode of extreme political and economic instability that hampered scientific communication.
* Many were published by European scientists and at first not mentioned or given little credit in the papers on sea floor spreading published by the American researchers in the 1960s.

=== Mid-oceanic ridge spreading and convection ===
In 1947, a team of scientists led by Maurice Ewing utilizing the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution&#x27;s research vessel &quot;Atlantis&quot; and an array of instruments, confirmed the existence of a rise in the central Atlantic Ocean, and found that the floor of the seabed beneath the layer of sediments consisted of basalt, not the granite which is the main constituent of continents. They also found that the oceanic crust was much thinner than continental crust. All these new findings raised important and intriguing questions.

The new data that had been collected on the ocean basins also showed particular characteristics regarding the bathymetry. One of the major outcomes of these datasets was that all along the globe, a system of mid-oceanic ridges was detected. An important conclusion was that along this system, new ocean floor was being created, which led to the concept of the &quot;Great Global Rift&quot;. This was described in the crucial paper of Bruce Heezen (1960) based on his work with Marie Tharp, which would trigger a real revolution in thinking. A profound consequence of seafloor spreading is that new crust was, and still is, being continually created along the oceanic ridges. For this reason, Heezen initially advocated the so-called &quot;expanding Earth&quot; hypothesis of S. Warren Carey (see above). Therefore, the question remained as to how new crust could continuously be added along the oceanic ridges without increasing the size of Earth. In reality, this question had been solved already by numerous scientists during the 1940s and the 1950s, like Arthur Holmes, Vening-Meinesz, Coates and many others: The crust in excess disappeared along what were called the oceanic trenches, where so-called &quot;subduction&quot; occurred. Therefore, when various scientists during the early 1960s started to reason on the data at their disposal regarding the ocean floor, the pieces of the theory quickly fell into place.

The question particularly intrigued Harry Hammond Hess, a Princeton University geologist and a Naval Reserve Rear Admiral, and Robert S. Dietz, a scientist with the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey who coined the term &quot;seafloor spreading&quot;. Dietz and Hess (the former published the same idea one year earlier in &quot;Nature&quot;, but priority belongs to Hess who had already distributed an unpublished manuscript of his 1962 article by 1960) were among the small number who really understood the broad implications of sea floor spreading and how it would eventually agree with the, at that time, unconventional and unaccepted ideas of continental drift and the elegant and mobilistic models proposed by previous workers like Holmes.

In the same year, Robert R. Coats of the U.S. Geological Survey described the main features of island arc subduction in the Aleutian Islands. His paper, though little noted (and sometimes even ridiculed) at the time, has since been called &quot;seminal&quot; and &quot;prescient&quot;. In reality, it shows that the work by the European scientists on island arcs and mountain belts performed and published during the 1930s up until the 1950s was applied and appreciated also in the United States.

If Earth&#x27;s crust was expanding along the oceanic ridges, Hess and Dietz reasoned like Holmes and others before them, it must be shrinking elsewhere. Hess followed Heezen, suggesting that new oceanic crust continuously spreads away from the ridges in a conveyor belt–like motion. And, using the mobilistic concepts developed before, he correctly concluded that many millions of years later, the oceanic crust eventually descends along the continental margins where oceanic trenches—very deep, narrow canyons—are formed, e.g. along the rim of the Pacific Ocean basin. The important step Hess made was that convection currents would be the driving force in this process, arriving at the same conclusions as Holmes had decades before with the only difference that the thinning of the ocean crust was performed using Heezen&#x27;s mechanism of spreading along the ridges. Hess therefore concluded that the Atlantic Ocean was expanding while the Pacific Ocean was shrinking. As old oceanic crust is &quot;consumed&quot; in the trenches (like Holmes and others, he thought this was done by thickening of the continental lithosphere, not, as later understood, by underthrusting at a larger scale of the oceanic crust itself into the mantle), new magma rises and erupts along the spreading ridges to form new crust. In effect, the ocean basins are perpetually being &quot;recycled&quot;, with the forming of new crust and the destruction of old oceanic lithosphere occurring simultaneously. Thus, the new mobilistic concepts neatly explained why Earth does not get bigger with sea floor spreading, why there is so little sediment accumulation on the ocean floor, and why oceanic rocks are much younger than continental rocks.

=== Magnetic striping ===


Beginning in the 1950s, scientists like Victor Vacquier, using magnetic instruments (magnetometers) adapted from airborne devices developed during World War II to detect submarines, began recognizing odd magnetic variations across the ocean floor. This finding, though unexpected, was not entirely surprising because it was known that basalt—the iron-rich, volcanic rock making up the ocean floor—contains a strongly magnetic mineral (magnetite) and can locally distort compass readings. This distortion was recognized by Icelandic mariners as early as the late 18th century. More importantly, because the presence of magnetite gives the basalt measurable magnetic properties, these newly discovered magnetic variations provided another means to study the deep ocean floor. When newly formed rock cools, such magnetic materials recorded Earth&#x27;s magnetic field at the time.

As more and more of the seafloor was mapped during the 1950s, the magnetic variations turned out not to be random or isolated occurrences, but instead revealed recognizable patterns. When these magnetic patterns were mapped over a wide region, the ocean floor showed a zebra-like pattern: one stripe with normal polarity and the adjoining stripe with reversed polarity. The overall pattern, defined by these alternating bands of normally and reversely polarized rock, became known as magnetic striping, and was published by Ron G. Mason and co-workers in 1961, who did not find, though, an explanation for these data in terms of sea floor spreading, like Vine, Matthews and Morley a few years later.

The discovery of magnetic striping called for an explanation. In the early 1960s scientists such as Heezen, Hess and Dietz had begun to theorise that mid-ocean ridges mark structurally weak zones where the ocean floor was being ripped in two lengthwise along the ridge crest (see the previous paragraph). New magma from deep within Earth rises easily through these weak zones and eventually erupts along the crest of the ridges to create new oceanic crust. This process, at first denominated the &quot;conveyer belt hypothesis&quot; and later called seafloor spreading, operating over many millions of years continues to form new ocean floor all across the 50,000 km-long system of mid-ocean ridges.

Only four years after the maps with the &quot;zebra pattern&quot; of magnetic stripes were published, the link between sea floor spreading and these patterns was recognized independently by Lawrence Morley, and by Fred Vine and Drummond Matthews, in 1963, (the Vine–Matthews–Morley hypothesis). This hypothesis linked these patterns to geomagnetic reversals and was supported by several lines of evidence:
# the stripes are symmetrical around the crests of the mid-ocean ridges; at or near the crest of the ridge, the rocks are very young, and they become progressively older away from the ridge crest;
# the youngest rocks at the ridge crest always have modern (normal) polarity;
# stripes of rock parallel to the ridge crest alternate in magnetic polarity (normal-reversed-normal, etc.), suggesting that they were formed during different epochs documenting the (already known from independent studies) normal and reversal episodes of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

By explaining both the zebra-like magnetic striping and the construction of the mid-ocean ridge system, the seafloor spreading hypothesis (SFS) quickly gained converts and represented another major advance in the development of the plate-tectonics theory. Furthermore, the oceanic crust came to be appreciated as a natural &quot;tape recording&quot; of the history of the geomagnetic field reversals (GMFR) of Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. Extensive studies were dedicated to the calibration of the normal-reversal patterns in the oceanic crust on one hand and known timescales derived from the dating of basalt layers in sedimentary sequences (magnetostratigraphy) on the other, to arrive at estimates of past spreading rates and plate reconstructions.

=== Definition and refining of the theory ===
After all these considerations, plate tectonics (or, as it was initially called &quot;New Global Tectonics&quot;) became quickly accepted and numerous papers followed that defined the concepts:

* In 1965, Tuzo Wilson who had been a promoter of the sea floor spreading hypothesis and continental drift from the very beginning added the concept of transform faults to the model, completing the classes of fault types necessary to make the mobility of the plates on the globe work out.
* A symposium on continental drift was held at the Royal Society of London in 1965 which must be regarded as the official start of the acceptance of plate tectonics by the scientific community, and which abstracts are issued as . In this symposium, Edward Bullard and co-workers showed with a computer calculation how the continents along both sides of the Atlantic would best fit to close the ocean, which became known as the famous &quot;Bullard&#x27;s Fit&quot;.
* In 1966 Wilson published the paper that referred to previous plate tectonic reconstructions, introducing the concept of what became known as the &quot;Wilson Cycle&quot;.
* In 1967, at the American Geophysical Union&#x27;s meeting, W. Jason Morgan proposed that Earth&#x27;s surface consists of 12 rigid plates that move relative to each other.
* Two months later, Xavier Le Pichon published a complete model based on six major plates with their relative motions, which marked the final acceptance by the scientific community of plate tectonics.
* In the same year, McKenzie and Parker independently presented a model similar to Morgan&#x27;s using translations and rotations on a sphere to define the plate motions.
* From that moment onwards, discussions have been focusing on the relative role of the forces driving plate tectonics, in order to evolve from a kinematic concept into a dynamic theory. Initially these concepts were focused on mantle convection, in the footsteps of A. Holmes, and also introduced the importance of the gravitational pull of subducted slabs through the works of Elsasser, Solomon, Sleep, Uyeda and Turcotte. Other authors evoked external driving forces due to the tidal drag of the Moon and other celestial bodies, and, especially since 2000, with the emergence of computational models reproducing Earth&#x27;s mantle behaviour to first order, following upon the older unifying concepts of van Bemmelen, authors re-evaluated the important role of mantle dynamics.

== Implications for life ==
According to a hypothesis proposed by Robert Stern and Taras Gerya, plate tectonics are a necessary criterion for a planet to be able to sustain complex life because of the role plate tectonics plays in regulating the carbon cycle.

Continental drift theory helps biogeographers to explain the disjunct biogeographic distribution of present-day life found on different continents but having similar ancestors.

== Plate reconstruction ==

Reconstruction is used to establish past (and future) plate configurations, helping determine the shape and make-up of ancient supercontinents and providing a basis for paleogeography.

=== Defining plate boundaries ===
Active plate boundaries are defined by their seismicity. Past plate boundaries within existing plates are identified from a variety of evidence, such as the presence of ophiolites that are indicative of vanished oceans.

=== Emergence of plate tectonics and past plate motions ===
The timing of the emergence of plate tectonics on Earth has been the subject of considerable controversy, with the estimated time varying wildly between researchers, spanning 85% of Earth&#x27;s history. Some authors have suggested that during at least part of the Archean period (~4-2.5 billion years ago) the mantle was between 100 and 250 °C warmer than at present, which is thought to be incompatible with modern-style plate tectonics, and that Earth may have had a stagnant lid or other kinds of regimes. The increasingly felsic nature of preserved rocks between 3 and 2.5 billion years ago implies that subduction zones had emerged by this time, with preserved zircons suggesting that subduction may have begun as early as 3.8 billion years ago. Early subduction zones appear to have been temporary and localized, though to what degree is controversial. Modern plate tectonics are suggested to have emerged by at least 2.2 billion years ago with the formation of the first recognised supercontinent Columbia, though some authors have suggested that modern-style plate tectonics did not appear until 800 million years ago based on the late appearance of rock types like blueschist which require cold subducted material. Other authors have suggested that plate tectonics were already functional in the Hadean, over 4 billion years ago.
Various types of quantitative and semi-quantitative information are available to constrain past plate motions. The geometric fit between continents, such as between west Africa and South America is still an important part of plate reconstruction. Magnetic stripe patterns provide a reliable guide to relative plate motions going back into the Jurassic period. The tracks of hotspots give absolute reconstructions, but these are only available back to the Cretaceous. Older reconstructions rely mainly on paleomagnetic pole data, although these only constrain the latitude and rotation, but not the longitude. Combining poles of different ages in a particular plate to produce apparent polar wander paths provides a method for comparing the motions of different plates through time. Additional evidence comes from the distribution of certain sedimentary rock types, faunal provinces shown by particular fossil groups, and the position of orogenic belts.

==== Formation and break-up of continents ====
The movement of plates has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a supercontinent that contains most or all of the continents. The supercontinent Columbia or Nuna formed during a period of and broke up about . The supercontinent Rodinia is thought to have formed about 1billion years ago and to have embodied most or all of Earth&#x27;s continents, and broken up into eight continents around . The eight continents later re-assembled into another supercontinent called Pangaea; Pangaea broke up into Laurasia (which became North America and Eurasia) and Gondwana (which became the remaining continents).

The Himalayas, the world&#x27;s tallest mountain range, are assumed to have been formed by the collision of two major plates. Before uplift, the area where they stand was covered by the Tethys Ocean.

== Modern plates ==

Depending on how they are defined, there are usually seven or eight &quot;major&quot; plates: African, Antarctic, Eurasian, North American, South American, Pacific, and Indo-Australian. The latter is sometimes subdivided into the Indian and Australian plates.

There are dozens of smaller plates, the eight largest of which are the Arabian, Caribbean, Juan de Fuca, Cocos, Nazca, Philippine Sea, Scotia and Somali.

During the 2020s, new proposals have come forward that divide the Earth&#x27;s crust into many smaller plates, called terranes, which reflects the fact that Plate reconstructions show that the larger plates have been internally deformed and oceanic and continental plates have been fragmented over time. This has resulted in the definition of roughly 1200 terranes inside the oceanic plates, continental blocks and the mobile zones (mountainous belts) that separate them.

The motion of the tectonic plates is determined by remote sensing satellite data sets, calibrated with ground station measurements.

== Other celestial bodies ==
The appearance of plate tectonics on terrestrial planets is related to planetary mass, with more massive planets than Earth expected to exhibit plate tectonics. Earth may be a borderline case, owing its tectonic activity to abundant water (silica and water form a deep eutectic).

=== Venus ===

Venus shows no evidence of active plate tectonics. There is debatable evidence of active tectonics in the planet&#x27;s distant past; however, events taking place since then (such as the plausible and generally accepted hypothesis that the Venusian lithosphere has thickened greatly over the course of several hundred million years) has made constraining the course of its geologic record difficult. However, the numerous well-preserved impact craters have been used as a dating method to approximately date the Venusian surface (since there are thus far no known samples of Venusian rock to be dated by more reliable methods). Dates derived are dominantly in the range , although ages of up to have been calculated. This research has led to the fairly well accepted hypothesis that Venus has undergone an essentially complete volcanic resurfacing at least once in its distant past, with the last event taking place approximately within the range of estimated surface ages. While the mechanism of such an impressive thermal event remains a debated issue in Venusian geosciences, some scientists are advocates of processes involving plate motion to some extent.

One explanation for Venus&#x27;s lack of plate tectonics is that on Venus temperatures are too high for significant water to be present. Earth&#x27;s crust is soaked with water, and water plays an important role in the development of shear zones. Plate tectonics requires weak surfaces in the crust along which crustal slices can move, and it may well be that such weakening never took place on Venus because of the absence of water. However, some researchers remain convinced that plate tectonics is or was once active on this planet.

=== Mars ===

Mars is considerably smaller than Earth and Venus, and there is evidence for ice on its surface and in its crust.

In the 1990s, it was proposed that Martian Crustal Dichotomy was created by plate tectonic processes. Scientists have since determined that it was created either by upwelling within the Martian mantle that thickened the crust of the Southern Highlands and formed Tharsis or by a giant impact that excavated the Northern Lowlands.

Valles Marineris may be a tectonic boundary.

Observations made of the magnetic field of Mars by the &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot; spacecraft in 1999 showed patterns of magnetic striping discovered on this planet. Some scientists interpreted these as requiring plate tectonic processes, such as seafloor spreading. However, their data failed a &quot;magnetic reversal test&quot;, which is used to see if they were formed by flipping polarities of a global magnetic field.

=== Icy moons ===
=== Exoplanets ===
On Earth-sized planets, plate tectonics is more likely if there are oceans of water. However, in 2007, two independent teams of researchers came to opposing conclusions about the likelihood of plate tectonics on larger super-Earths with one team saying that plate tectonics would be episodic or stagnant and the other team saying that plate tectonics is very likely on super-earths even if the planet is dry.

Consideration of plate tectonics is a part of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence and extraterrestrial life.

<doc id="24946" wikidata="Q7185533" url="?curid=24946" title="Philips Videopac+ G7400">
<text>The Philips Videopac+ G7400 is a third-generation home video game console released in limited quantities in 1983, and only in Europe; an American release as the Odyssey³ Command Center was planned for the Odyssey series but never occurred. The G7400 was the successor to the Philips Videopac G7000, the European counterpart to the American Magnavox Odyssey². The system featured excellently tailored background and foreground graphics.

The G7400 could play three types of games: all normal G7000 games, special G7000 games with additional high-res background graphics that would appear only when played on the G7400, and G7400-only games with high-res sprites and backgrounds.

== Odyssey³ ==

There were plans to release the G7400 in the United States as the Odyssey³ and later as the Odyssey³ Command Center; the system was demonstrated at the 1983 Consumer Electronics Show, and some prototypes have been found. The Odyssey³ was never released, mostly because company executives concluded that it was not technologically advanced enough to compete in the marketplace, and the video game crash of 1983 ended all lingering hopes for a release.

The Odyssey³ was to feature a real mechanical keyboard, unlike the membrane keyboard found in the G7000 and Odyssey², as well as a built-in joystick holder for dual-joystick games. Prototypes for a 300 baud modem and a speech synthesizer are known to have been made, and a laserdisc interface was planned to allow even more advanced games.

== Specifications ==
* CPU: Intel 8048, 5.91 MHz
* RAM: 6 KB + 192 Byte
* ROM: 1 KB
* Display: 320×238×16 (Intel 8245 for G7000 compatible 128x64 16 color graphics and Thomson EF9340 [VIN] and EF9341 [GEN] )
* Audio: 1 channel, 8 sounds
* Input / Output: RF modulator, Péritel/SCART connector (with RGB), joystick port(s), ROM cartridge port
* Expansion
** The Voice – Speech synthesis unit, compatible with G7000
** Chess Module – Increased the G7400&#x27;s computing power such that it could play chess, also compatible with G7000
** Microsoft BASIC Home Computer Module (C7420) – Similar to above, with the purpose of converting the G7400 into a &quot;real&quot; computer, not compatible with G7000. An additional Z80 CPU with 16 KB RAM and 16 KB ROM.

== Legacy ==
The Videopac Collection Volume 1 was released on Steam on November 24, 2022. It uses O2EM for emulation and includes the G7400 versions of the games when applicable.

<doc id="24947" wikidata="Q216293" url="?curid=24947" title="Pong">
<text>Pong is a 1972 sports video game developed and published by Atari for arcades. It is one of the earliest arcade video games; it was created by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney were surprised by the quality of Alcorn&#x27;s work and decided to manufacture the game. Bushnell based the game&#x27;s concept on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console. In response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent infringement.

&quot;Pong&quot; was the first commercially successful video game, and it helped to establish the video game industry along with the Magnavox Odyssey. Soon after its release, several companies began producing games that closely mimicked its gameplay. Eventually, Atari&#x27;s competitors released new types of video games that deviated from &quot;Pong&quot;&#x27;s original format to varying degrees, and this, in turn, led Atari to encourage its staff to move beyond &quot;Pong&quot; and produce more innovative games themselves.

Atari released several sequels to &quot;Pong&quot; that built upon the original&#x27;s gameplay by adding new features. During the 1975 Christmas season, Atari released a home version of &quot;Pong&quot; exclusively through Sears retail stores. The home version was also a commercial success and led to numerous clones. The game was remade on numerous home and portable platforms following its release. Considered to be one of the most culturally significant and greatest video games of all time, &quot;Pong&quot; is part of the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Pong&quot; is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The goal is for each player to reach eleven points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.

==Development and history==

&quot;Pong&quot; was the first game developed by Atari. In 1971, Bushnell and Dabney founded Syzygy Engineering to develop the concept of a standalone computer system with a monitor and attaching a coin slot to it to play games on. Drawing inspiration from &quot;Spacewar!&quot;, the duo created &quot;Computer Space&quot;. As the game did not fare well commercially, Bushnell decided to form a company to produce more games by licensing ideas to other companies. The first contract was with Bally Manufacturing Corporation for a driving game. Soon after the founding, Bushnell hired Allan Alcorn because of his experience with electrical engineering and computer science; Bushnell and Dabney also had previously worked with him at Ampex. Prior to working at Atari, Alcorn had no experience with video games. Bushnell had originally planned to develop a driving video game, influenced by Chicago Coin&#x27;s &quot;Speedway&quot; (1969) which at the time was the biggest-selling electro-mechanical game at his amusement arcade. However, Bushnell had concerns that it might be too complicated for Alcorn&#x27;s first game.

To acclimate Alcorn to creating games, Bushnell gave him a project secretly meant to be a warm-up exercise. Bushnell told Alcorn that he had a contract with General Electric for a product, and asked Alcorn to create a simple game with one moving spot, two paddles, and digits for score keeping. In 2011, Bushnell stated that the game was inspired by previous versions of electronic tennis he had played before; Bushnell played a version on a PDP-1 computer in 1964 while attending college. However, Alcorn has claimed it was in direct response to Bushnell&#x27;s viewing of the Magnavox Odyssey&#x27;s Tennis game. In May 1972, Bushnell had visited the Magnavox Profit Caravan in Burlingame, California where he played the Magnavox Odyssey demonstration, specifically the table tennis game. Though he thought the game lacked quality, seeing it prompted Bushnell to assign the project to Alcorn.

Alcorn first examined Bushnell&#x27;s schematics for &quot;Computer Space&quot;, but found them to be illegible. He went on to create his own designs based on his knowledge of transistor–transistor logic (TTL) and Bushnell&#x27;s game. Feeling the basic game was too boring, Alcorn added features to give the game more appeal. He divided the paddle into eight segments to change the ball&#x27;s angle of return. For example, the center segments return the ball at a 90° angle in relation to the paddle, while the outer segments return the ball at smaller angles. He also made the ball accelerate the longer it remained in play; missing the ball reset the speed. Another feature was that the in-game paddles were unable to reach the top of the screen. This was caused by a simple circuit that had an inherent defect. Instead of dedicating time to fixing the defect, Alcorn decided it gave the game more difficulty and helped limit the time the game could be played; he imagined two skilled players being able to play forever otherwise.

Three months into development, Bushnell told Alcorn he wanted the game to feature realistic sound effects and a roaring crowd. Dabney wanted the game to &quot;boo&quot; and &quot;hiss&quot; when a player lost a round. Alcorn had limited space available for the necessary electronics and was unaware of how to create such sounds with digital circuits. After inspecting the sync generator, he discovered that it could generate different tones and used those for the game&#x27;s sound effects. To construct the prototype, Alcorn purchased a $75 Hitachi black-and-white television set from a local store, placed it into a wooden cabinet, and soldered the wires into boards to create the necessary circuitry. The prototype impressed Bushnell and Dabney so much that they felt it could be a profitable product and decided to test its marketability.

In August 1972, Bushnell and Alcorn installed the &quot;Pong&quot; prototype at a local bar, Andy Capp&#x27;s Tavern. They selected the bar because of their good working relation with the bar&#x27;s owner and manager, Bill Gaddis; Atari supplied pinball machines to Gaddis. Bushnell and Alcorn placed the prototype on one of the tables near the other entertainment machines: a jukebox, pinball machines, and &quot;Computer Space&quot;. The game was well received the first night and its popularity continued to grow over the next one and a half weeks. Bushnell then went on a business trip to Chicago to demonstrate &quot;Pong&quot; to executives at Bally and Midway Manufacturing; he intended to use &quot;Pong&quot; to fulfill his contract with Bally, rather than the driving game. A few days later, the prototype began exhibiting technical issues and Gaddis contacted Alcorn to fix it. Upon inspecting the machine, Alcorn discovered that the problem was that the coin mechanism was overflowing with quarters.

After hearing about the game&#x27;s success, Bushnell decided there would be more profit for Atari to manufacture the game rather than license it, but the interest of Bally and Midway had already been piqued. Bushnell decided to inform each of the two groups that the other was uninterested—Bushnell told the Bally executives that the Midway executives did not want it and vice versa—to preserve the relationships for future dealings. Upon hearing Bushnell&#x27;s comment, the two groups declined his offer. Bushnell had difficulty finding financial backing for &quot;Pong&quot;; banks viewed it as a variant of pinball, which at the time the general public associated with the Mafia. Atari eventually obtained a line of credit from Wells Fargo that it used to expand its facilities to house an assembly line. The company announced &quot;Pong&quot; on 29 November 1972. Management sought assembly workers at the local unemployment office, but was unable to keep up with demand. The first arcade cabinets produced were assembled very slowly, about ten machines a day, many of which failed quality testing. Atari eventually streamlined the process and began producing the game in greater quantities. By 1973, they began shipping &quot;Pong&quot; to other countries with the aid of foreign partners.

In Japan, &quot;Pong&quot; was officially released in November 1973 by Atari Japan, which would later be sold to Namco. However, &quot;Pong&quot; had been beaten to the market by two Japanese &quot;Pong&quot; clones released in July 1973: Sega&#x27;s &quot;Pong Tron&quot; and Taito&#x27;s &quot;Elepong&quot;.

===Home version ===

After the success of &quot;Pong&quot;, Bushnell pushed his employees to create new products. A new electronic technology, the large-scale integration (LSI) chip, had recently become available, which Bushnell believed would &quot;allow pioneering in new&quot; game concepts. Atari began working on the reduction of &quot;Pong&quot; from a large arcade printed circuit board (PCB) down to a small LSI chip for use in a home system. The initial development cost for a game on a single LSI chip was expensive, costing around , but once the chip was developed, it became significantly cheaper to mass-produce the game as well as more difficult to reverse-engineer.

In 1974, Atari engineer Harold Lee proposed a home version of &quot;Pong&quot; that would connect to a television: &quot;Home Pong&quot;. The system began development under the codename &quot;Darlene&quot;, named after an employee at Atari. Alcorn worked with Lee to develop the designs and prototype and based them on the same digital technology used in their arcade games. The two worked in shifts to save time and money; Lee worked on the design&#x27;s logic during the day, while Alcorn debugged the designs in the evenings. After the designs were approved, fellow Atari engineer Bob Brown assisted Alcorn and Lee in building a prototype. The prototype consisted of a device attached to a wooden pedestal containing over a hundred wires, which would eventually be replaced with a single chip designed by Alcorn and Lee; the chip had yet to be tested and built before the prototype was constructed. The chip was finished in the latter half of 1974, and was, at the time, the highest-performing chip used in a consumer product.

Bushnell and Gene Lipkin, Atari&#x27;s vice-president of sales, approached toy and electronic retailers to sell &quot;Home Pong&quot;, but were rejected. Retailers felt the product was too expensive and would not interest consumers. Bushnell contacted Sears after coming across a Magnavox Odyssey advertisement in the sporting goods section of its catalog. Atari staff (including Bushnell and Lipkin) discussed the game with a representative, Tom Quinn, who expressed enthusiasm and offered the company an exclusive deal. Believing they could find more favorable terms elsewhere, Atari&#x27;s executives declined and continued to pursue toy retailers. In January 1975, Atari staff set up a &quot;Home Pong&quot; booth at the American Toy Fair (a trade fair) in New York City, but was unsuccessful in soliciting orders due to high price of the unit.

While at the show, they met Quinn again, and, a few days later, set up a meeting with him to obtain a sales order. In order to gain approval from the Sporting Goods department, Quinn suggested Atari demonstrate the game to executives in Chicago. Alcorn and Lipkin traveled to the Sears Tower and, despite a technical complication in connection with an antenna on top of the building which broadcast on the same channel as the game, obtained approval. Bushnell told Quinn he could produce 75,000 units in time for the Christmas season; however, Quinn requested double the amount. Though Bushnell knew Atari lacked the capacity to manufacture 150,000 units, he agreed. Atari acquired a new factory through funding obtained by venture capitalist Don Valentine. Supervised by Jimm Tubb, the factory fulfilled the Sears order. The first units manufactured, branded with Sears&#x27; &quot;Tele-Games&quot; name, started to sell around the end of October to mid November 1975 with a 1-year warranty for $98.95 and an additional $7.95 for the optional AC adapter. Atari later released a version under its own brand in 1976.

===Lawsuit from Magnavox===

In April 1974, Magnavox filed suit against Atari, Allied Leisure, Bally Midway and Chicago Dynamics. Magnavox argued that Atari had infringed on Sanders Associates&#x27; patents relating to the concept of electronic ping-pong based on detailed records Ralph Baer kept of the Odyssey&#x27;s design process dating back to 1966. Other documents included depositions from witnesses and a signed guest book that demonstrated Bushnell had played the Odyssey&#x27;s table tennis game prior to releasing &quot;Pong&quot;. In response to claims that he saw the Odyssey, Bushnell later stated that, &quot;The fact is that I absolutely did see the Odyssey game and I didn&#x27;t think it was very clever.&quot;

After considering his options, Bushnell decided to settle with Magnavox out of court in June 1976. Bushnell&#x27;s lawyer felt they could win; however, he estimated legal costs of US$1.5 million, which would have exceeded Atari&#x27;s funds. Magnavox offered Atari an agreement to become a licensee for US$1.5 million payable in eight installments. In addition, Magnavox obtained the right to full information on Atari products publicly announced or released over the next year. Magnavox continued to pursue legal action against the other companies, and proceedings began shortly after Atari&#x27;s settlement. The first case took place at the district court in Chicago, with Judge John Grady presiding. Magnavox won the suit against the remaining defendants. Atari may have delayed the announcement of the Atari 2600 by a few months to avoid disclosing information about the system under the settlement agreement.

==Impact and legacy==

The &quot;Pong&quot; arcade games manufactured by Atari were a great success. The prototype was well received by Andy Capp&#x27;s Tavern patrons; people came to the bar solely to play the game. Following its release, &quot;Pong&quot; consistently earned four times more revenue than other coin-operated machines. Bushnell estimated that the game earned US$35–40 per day (i.e.140–160 plays daily per console at $0.25 per play), which he described as nothing he&#x27;d ever seen before in the coin-operated entertainment industry at the time. The game&#x27;s earning power resulted in an increase in the number of orders Atari received. This provided Atari with a steady source of income; the company sold the machines at three times the cost of production. By 1973, the company had filled 2,500 orders, and at the end of 1974, sold more than 8,000 units. The arcade cabinets have since become collector&#x27;s items, with cocktail cabinets being the rarest. Soon after the game&#x27;s successful testing at Andy Capp&#x27;s Tavern, other companies began visiting the bar to inspect it. Similar games appeared on the market three months later, produced by companies like Ramtek and Nutting Associates. Atari could do little against the competitors as they had not initially filed for patents on the solid state technology used in the game. When the company did file for patents, complications delayed the process. As a result, the market consisted primarily of &quot;&quot;Pong&quot; clones&quot;; author Steven Kent estimated that Atari had produced less than a third of the machines. Bushnell referred to the competitors as &quot;Jackals&quot; because he felt they had an unfair advantage. His solution to competing against them was to produce more innovative games and concepts.

&quot;Home Pong&quot; was an instant success following its limited 1975 release through Sears; around 150,000 units were sold that holiday season. The game became Sears&#x27; most successful product at the time, which earned Atari a Sears Quality Excellence Award. Atari&#x27;s own version sold an additional 50,000 units. Similar to the arcade version, several companies released clones to capitalize on the home console&#x27;s success, many of which continued to produce new consoles and video games. Magnavox re-released their Odyssey system with simplified hardware and new features and, later, released updated versions. Coleco entered the video game market with their Telstar console; it features three &quot;Pong&quot; variants and was also succeeded by newer models. Nintendo released the Color TV-Game 6 in 1977, which plays six variations of electronic tennis. The next year, it was followed by an updated version, the Color TV-Game 15, which features fifteen variations. The systems were Nintendo&#x27;s entry into the home video game market and the first to produce themselves—they had previously licensed the Magnavox Odyssey. The dedicated &quot;Pong&quot; consoles and the numerous clones have since become varying levels of rare; Atari&#x27;s &quot;Pong&quot; consoles are common, while APF Electronics&#x27; TV Fun consoles are moderately rare. Prices among collectors, however, vary with rarity; the Sears Tele-Games versions are often cheaper than those with the Atari brand.

Several publications consider &quot;Pong&quot; the game that launched the video game industry as a lucrative enterprise. Video game author David Ellis sees the game as the cornerstone of the video game industry&#x27;s success, and called the arcade game &quot;one of the most historically significant&quot; titles. Kent attributes the &quot;arcade phenomenon&quot; to &quot;Pong&quot; and Atari&#x27;s games that followed it, and considers the release of the home version the successful beginning of home video game consoles. Bill Loguidice and Matt Barton of Gamasutra referred to the game&#x27;s release as the start of a new entertainment medium, and commented that its simple, intuitive gameplay made it a success. In 1995, Flux magazine ranked the game 56th on their &quot;Top 100 Video Games.&quot; In 1996 &quot;Next Generation&quot; named it one of the &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, recounting that &quot;&quot;Next Generation&quot; staff ignor[ed] hundreds of thousands of dollars of 32-bit software to play &quot;Pong&quot; for hours when the Genesis version was released.&quot; In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;Pong&quot; as number 34 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that, &quot;Despite, or perhaps because of, its simplicity, &quot;Pong&quot; is the ultimate two-player challenge – a test of reaction times and very simple strategy stripped down to its barest essentials.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;Pong&quot; one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013. Many of the companies that produced their own versions of &quot;Pong&quot; eventually became well known within the industry. Nintendo entered the video game market with clones of &quot;Home Pong&quot;. The revenue generated from them—each system sold over a million units—helped the company survive a difficult financial time, and spurred them to pursue video games further. After seeing the success of &quot;Pong&quot;, Konami decided to break into the arcade game market and released its first title, &quot;Maze&quot;. Its moderate success drove the company to develop more titles. In 2015, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;Pong&quot; to its World Video Game Hall of Fame.

Bushnell felt that &quot;Pong&quot; was especially significant in its role as a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: &quot;It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, &#x27;I&#x27;d like to play &quot;Pong&quot; and there&#x27;s nobody to play.&#x27; It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, there are a lot of people who have come up to me over the years and said, &#x27;I met my wife playing &quot;Pong&quot;,&#x27; and that&#x27;s kind of a nice thing to have achieved.&quot;

===Ports===
Atari remade the game on numerous platforms. In 1977, &quot;Pong&quot; and several variants of the game were featured in &quot;Video Olympics&quot;, one of the original release titles for the Atari 2600.

&quot;Pong&quot; has also been included in several Atari compilations on many different platforms, such as &quot;Arcade Classics&quot; on the Sega Genesis, Paired with &quot;Asteroids&quot; and &quot;Yars&#x27; Revenge&quot; on the Game Boy Advance. &quot;Atari Classics Evolved&quot; on the PlayStation Portable, &quot;Retro Atari Classics&quot; on the Nintendo DS, and &quot;Atari: 80 Classic Games in One!&quot; for personal computer, and the &quot;Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration&quot; (2022) compilation for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Steam, and Xbox One.

Through an agreement with Atari, Bally Gaming and Systems developed a slot machine version of the game.

The game was also included as a loading screen minigame on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions of &quot;TD Overdrive: The Brotherhood of Speed&quot;, however the Windows version doesn&#x27;t include it.

===Sequels and remakes===

Bushnell felt the best way to compete against imitators was to create better products, leading Atari to produce sequels in the years following the original&#x27;s release: &quot;Pong Doubles&quot;, &quot;Super Pong&quot;, &quot;Quadrapong&quot; and &quot;Pinpong&quot;. The sequels feature similar graphics, but include new gameplay elements; for example, &quot;Pong Doubles&quot; allows four players to compete in pairs, while &quot;Quadrapong&quot;—also released by Kee Games as &quot;Elimination&quot;—has them compete against each other in a four-way field. Bushnell also conceptualized a free-to-play version of &quot;Pong&quot; to entertain children in a Doctor&#x27;s office. He initially titled it &quot;Snoopy Pong&quot; and fashioned the cabinet after Snoopy&#x27;s doghouse with the character on top, but retitled it to &quot;Puppy Pong&quot; and altered Snoopy to a generic dog to avoid legal action. Bushnell later used the game in his chain of Chuck E. Cheese&#x27;s restaurants. In 1976, Atari released &quot;Breakout&quot;, a single-player variation of &quot;Pong&quot; where the object of the game is to remove bricks from a wall by hitting them with a ball. Like &quot;Pong&quot;, &quot;Breakout&quot; was followed by numerous clones that copied the gameplay, such as &quot;Arkanoid&quot;, &quot;Alleyway&quot;, and &quot;Break &#x27;Em All&quot;.

A 3D platform game with puzzle and shooter elements was reportedly in development by Atari Corporation for the Atari Jaguar in September 1995 under the title &quot;Pong 2000&quot;, as part of their series of arcade game updates for the system and was set to have an original storyline for it, but it was never released.

In 1999, Hasbro Interactive released a new title known as &quot;&quot; for home computers and the PlayStation. This game was released as part of a trend within the time period of popular arcade games being remade with 3D graphics and art styles. The game also featured many power-ups.

In 2012, Atari celebrated the 40th anniversary of &quot;Pong&quot; by releasing &quot;Pong World&quot; for iOS, which was developed by zGames. In 2020, a new game titled &quot;Pong Quest&quot; was developed by Chequered Ink and released by Atari on Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch. A remake of &quot;Pong&quot; has been announced for release exclusively for the Intellivision Amico.

===In popular culture===
The game is featured in episodes of television series including &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;, &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. In 2006, an American Express commercial featured Andy Roddick in a tennis match against the white, in-game paddle. Other video games have also referenced and parodied &quot;Pong&quot;; for example &quot;Neuromancer&quot; for the Commodore 64 and &quot;Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts &amp; Bolts&quot; for the Xbox 360. The concert event Video Games Live has performed audio from &quot;Pong&quot; as part of a special retro &quot;Classic Arcade Medley&quot;. Frank Black&#x27;s song &quot;Whatever Happened to Pong?&quot; on the album &quot;Teenager of the Year&quot; references the game&#x27;s elements.

Dutch design studio Buro Vormkrijgers created a &quot;Pong&quot;-themed clock as a fun project within their offices. After the studio decided to manufacture it for retail, Atari took legal action in February 2006. The two companies eventually reached an agreement in which Buro Vormkrijgers could produce a limited number under license. In 1999, French artist Pierre Huyghe created an installation titled &quot;Atari Light&quot;, in which two people use handheld gaming devices to play &quot;Pong&quot; on an illuminated ceiling. The work was shown at the Venice Biennale in 2001, and the Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Castilla y León in 2007. The game was included in the London Barbican Art Gallery&#x27;s 2002 Game On exhibition meant to showcase the various aspects of video game history, development, and culture.

<text>A post office is a public facility and a retailer that provides mail services, such as accepting letters and parcels, providing post office boxes, and selling postage stamps, packaging, and stationery. Post offices may offer additional services, which vary by country. These include providing and accepting government forms (such as passport applications), and processing government services and fees (such as road tax, postal savings, or bank fees). The chief administrator of a post office is called a postmaster.

Before the advent of postal codes and the post office, postal systems would route items to a specific post office for receipt or delivery. During the 19th century in the United States, this often led to smaller communities being renamed after their post offices, particularly after the Post Office Department began to require that post office names not be duplicated within a state.

==Name==
The term &quot;post-office&quot; has been in use since the 1650s, shortly after the legalisation of private mail services in England in 1635. In early modern England, post riders—mounted couriers—were placed, or &quot;posted&quot;, every few hours along post roads at posting houses (also known as post houses) between major cities, or &quot;post towns&quot;. These stables or inns permitted important correspondence to travel without delay. In early America, post offices were also known as stations. This term, as well as the term &quot;post house&quot;, fell from use as horse and coach services were replaced by railways, aircraft, and automobiles.
The term &quot;post office&quot; usually refers to government postal facilities providing customer service. &quot;General Post Office&quot; is sometimes used for the national headquarters of a postal service, even if the building does not provide customer service. A postal facility that is used exclusively for processing mail is instead known as a sorting office or delivery office, which may have a large central area known as a sorting or postal hall. Integrated facilities combining mail processing with railway stations or airports are known as mail exchanges.

In India, post offices are found in almost every village having panchayat (a &quot;village council&quot;), towns, cities, and throughout the geographical area of India. India&#x27;s postal system changed its name to India Post after the advent of private courier companies in the 1990s. It is run by the Indian government&#x27;s Department of Posts. India Post accepts and delivers inland letters, postcards, parcels, postal stamps, and money orders (money transfers). Few post offices in India offer speed post (fast delivery) and payments or bank savings services. It is also uncommon for Indian post offices to sell insurance policies or accept payment for electricity, landline telephone, or gas bills. Until the 2000 A.D., post offices would collect fees for radio licenses, recruitment for government jobs, and the operation of public call telephone (PCO) booths. Postmen would deliver letters, money orders, and parcels to places that are within the assigned area of a particular post office. Each Indian post office is assigned a unique six-digit code called the Postal Index Number, or PIN. Each post office is identified by its PIN. Post offices coming under Department of Posts, Ministry of Communication, Government of India have a history of one hundred fifty years.

Private courier and delivery services often have offices as well, although these are usually not called &quot;post offices&quot;, except in the case of Germany, which has fully privatised its national postal system.

As abbreviation &quot;PO&quot; is used, together with &quot;GPO&quot; for General Post Office and &quot;LPO&quot; for Licensed Post Office.

==History==

There is evidence of corps of royal couriers disseminating the decrees of Egyptian pharaohs as early as 2400BCE, and it is possible that the service greatly precedes that date. Similarly, there may be ancient organised systems of post houses providing mounted courier service, although sources vary as to precisely who initiated the practice.

In the Persian Empire, a Chapar Khaneh system existed along the Royal Road. Similar postage systems were established in India and China by the Mauryan and Han dynasties in the 2nd century BCE.

The Roman historian Suetonius credited Augustus with regularising the Roman transportation and courier network, the &quot;Cursus Publicus&quot;. Local officials were obliged to provide couriers who would be responsible for their message&#x27;s entire course. Locally maintained post houses () privately owned rest houses () and were obliged or honored to care for couriers along their way. The Roman emperor Diocletian later established two parallel systems: one providing fresh horses or mules for urgent correspondence and the other providing sturdy oxen for bulk shipments. The Byzantine historian Procopius, though not unbiased, records the &quot;Cursus Publicus&quot; system remained largely intact until it was dismantled in the Byzantine empire by the emperor Justinian in the 6th century.

The Princely House of Thurn and Taxis family initiated regular mail service from Brussels in the 16th century, directing the Imperial Post of the Holy Roman Empire. The British Postal Museum claims that the oldest functioning post office in the world is on High Street in Sanquhar, Scotland. The post office has functioned continuously since 1712, during which horses and stagecoaches were used to carry mail.

Rural parts of Canada in the 19th century utilised the way office system. Villagers could leave their letters at the way office which were then taken to the nearest post office, as well as pick up their mail from the way office.

In parts of Europe, special postal censorship offices existed to intercept and censor mail. In France, such offices were known as cabinets noirs.

==Unstaffed postal facilities==
In many jurisdictions, mailboxes and post office boxes have long been in widespread use for drop-off and pickup (respectively) of mail and small packages outside post offices or when offices are closed. Germany&#x27;s national postage system Deutsche Post introduced the Pack-Station for package delivery, including both drop-off and pickup, in 2001. In the 2000s, the United States Postal Service began to install Automated Postal Centers (APCs) in many locations in both post offices, for when they are closed or busy, and retail locations. APCs can print postage and accept mail and small packages.

<text>The PlayStation 3 (PS3) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). The successor to the PlayStation 2, it is part of the PlayStation brand of consoles. It was first released on November 11, 2006, in Japan, November 17, 2006, in North America, and March 23, 2007, in Europe and Australasia. The PlayStation 3 competed primarily against Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox 360 and Nintendo&#x27;s Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles.

The PlayStation 3 was developed on the purpose-built Cell processor, co-developed with Toshiba and IBM; SCE&#x27;s president Ken Kutaragi envisioned a home entertainment system akin to supercomputers. It was the first console to use the Blu-ray disc as its primary storage medium, the first to be equipped with an HDMI port, and graphically was the first to be able to output at 1080p (Full HD) resolution. The console launched together with the PlayStation Network online service, and was also the first to be controllable from a handheld console through its Remote Play connectivity. In September 2009, the &quot;Slim&quot; model of the PlayStation 3 was released; it no longer provided the hardware ability to run PS2 games, but it was lighter and thinner than the original version. A &quot;Super Slim&quot; redesign was released in late 2012, further refining the console.

During its early years, the system received a mixed reception, due to its high price ($599 for a 60-gigabyte model, $499 for a 20 GB model), a complex processor architecture, and lack of quality games, but was praised for its Blu-ray capabilities and &quot;untapped potential&quot;. The reception improved over time. The system had a slow start in the market but managed to recover, particularly after the introduction of the &quot;Slim&quot; model, and managed to sell 87.4 million units to outsell the competing Xbox 360 and become the eighth-bestselling video game console in history. As of March 31, 2019, 999.4 million Playstation 3 games have been sold.

Its successor, the PlayStation 4, was released in November 2013; Sony started discontinuing the PlayStation 3 within two years, with shipments of new units ending in most of the world by 2016, and the final units produced until May 29, 2017 for the Japanese market.

== History ==
The PlayStation 3 began development on March 9, 2001 when Ken Kutaragi, then the President of Sony Computer Entertainment, announced that Sony, Toshiba, and IBM would collaborate on developing the Cell microprocessor. At the time, Shuhei Yoshida led a group of programmers within this hardware team to explore next-generation game creation. By early 2005, focus within Sony shifted towards developing PS3 launch titles. In September 2004, Sony stated that the PlayStation 3 would utilize Blu-ray and that the console would also play DVDs and CDs, and the following December, Nvidia was announced as a design partner for the console&#x27;s graphics chip. Sony officially unveiled PlayStation 3 to the public on May 16, 2005, at E3 2005, along with a boomerang-shaped prototype design of the Sixaxis controller. A functional version of the system was not present there,

nor at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2005, although demonstrations (such as &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;) were held at both events on software development kits and comparable personal computer hardware. Video footage based on the predicted PlayStation 3 specifications was also shown (notably a &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; tech demo).

The initial prototype shown in May 2005 featured two HDMI ports, three Ethernet ports and six USB ports; however, when the system was shown again a year later at E3 2006, these were reduced to one HDMI port, one Ethernet port and four USB ports, presumably to cut costs. Two hardware configurations were also announced for the console: a 20 GB model and a 60 GB model, priced at US$499 (€499) and US$599 (€599), respectively. The 60 GB model was to be the only configuration to feature an HDMI port, Wi-Fi internet, flash card readers and a chrome trim with the logo in silver. Both models were announced for a simultaneous worldwide release: November 11, 2006, for Japan and November 17, 2006, for North America and Europe.

On September 6, 2006, Sony announced that PAL region PlayStation 3 launch would be delayed until March 2007, because of a shortage of materials used in the Blu-ray drive. At the Tokyo Game Show on September 22, 2006, Sony announced that it would include an HDMI port on the 20 GB system, but a chrome trim, flash card readers, silver logo and Wi-Fi would not be included. Also, the launch price of the Japanese 20 GB model was reduced by over 20%, and the 60 GB model was announced for an open pricing scheme in Japan. During the event, Sony showed 27 playable PS3 games running on final hardware.

=== Launch ===
The PlayStation 3 was first released in Japan on November 11, 2006, at 07:00. According to Media Create, 81,639 PS3 systems were sold within 24 hours of its introduction in Japan. There were reports that many of the initial systems were obtained by businessmen who paid mainly Chinese nationals to buy the system without any software to resell on eBay, and, as a result of this, there were more hardware units sold than there were games. &quot;Ridge Racer 7&quot; was the highest selling game on launch day. Soon after its release in Japan, the PS3 was released in North America on November 17, 2006. Reports of violence surrounded the release of the PS3. A customer was shot, campers were robbed at gunpoint, customers were shot in a drive-by shooting with BB guns, and 60 campers fought over 10 systems. The PS3 was released on the same day in Hong Kong and Taiwan as well.

The console was originally planned for a global release through November, but at the start of September the release in Europe and the rest of the world was delayed until March. Since it was a somewhat last-minute delay, some companies had taken deposits for pre-orders, at which Sony informed customers that they were eligible for full refunds or could continue the pre-order. On January 24, 2007, Sony announced that PlayStation 3 would go on sale on March 23, 2007, in Europe, Australia, the Middle East, Africa and New Zealand. Its European launch price was €599 (€629 in Ireland, £425 in Britain), R6499 minimum in South Africa, AU$999.95 in Australia, NZ$1199.95 in New Zealand.

On March 7, 2007, the 60 GB PlayStation 3 launched in Singapore with a price of S$799. In the United Arab Emirates, the system retailed for 2499 dirhams on March 23, slightly less than the price in Europe. Sony also hosted a large launch party with singer Shakira performing at the Dubai Autodrome.

The PS3 sold 600,000 units in the first two days of its release in Europe. It became the fastest-selling home system in the United Kingdom with 165,000 units sold in two days, and became the second-fastest-selling system in the UK overall, the fastest being the PlayStation Portable. Some British retailers claim that the PS3 was subjected to as many as 20,000 pre-order cancellations, while others cited a &quot;huge demand&quot; for the system. System sales for the following week were down 82%, selling 30,000 units, with a 60% drop in sales of the two most popular titles, &quot;MotorStorm&quot; and &quot;Resistance: Fall of Man&quot;. Its UK launch price of £425 was higher than its Japanese and American prices, with value-added tax cited as a reason by a staff member. The continental Europe price was €599, while in Ireland it was €629.

Over 27,000 units were sold in Australia over the course of the first ten days of sales and nine of the top ten best-selling games, including systems and handheld, of the week were for the PS3; overall, software and hardware sales resulted in A$33 million netted for Sony. One analyst called it &quot;a spike in retail spending not previously witnessed at the launch of any other system in Australia&quot;. In New Zealand, over 4,800 units were sold in the first week generating &quot;over NZ$6.8 million dollars in hardware and software retail sales.&quot;

On April 27, 2007, it launched in India, with the 60 GB model retailing for ₹39,990 (US$1000 at the conversion rate at the time). In Mexico, the 20 GB model launched with a price of 10,495 pesos, or US$974 at the time. The console was launched in South Korea on June 16, 2007, as a single version equipped with an 80 GB hard drive and IPTV.

=== &quot;Slim&quot; model ===
Following speculation that Sony was working on a &#x27;slim&#x27; model, Sony officially announced the PS3 CECH-2000 model on August 18, 2009, at the Sony Gamescom press conference. New features included a slimmer form factor, decreased power consumption, and a quieter cooling system. It was released in major territories by September 2009. At the same time, a new logo was introduced for the console to replace the previous &quot;Spider-Man&quot; wordmarks (named due to their use of the same font as the logos of Sony&#x27;s then-current &quot;Spider-Man&quot; films), with a new &quot;PS3&quot; wordmark evoking the design of the PlayStation 2 wordmark replacing the capitalized PlayStation 3 lettering.

=== &quot;Super Slim&quot; model ===
In September 2012 at the Tokyo Game Show, Sony announced that a new, slimmer PS3 redesign (CECH-4000) was due for release in late 2012 and that it would be available with either a 250 GB or 500 GB hard drive. Three versions of the &quot;Super Slim&quot; model were revealed: one with a 500 GB hard drive, a second with a 250 GB hard drive which was not available in PAL regions, and a third with a 12 GB flash storage that was available in PAL regions, and in Canada. The storage of 12 GB model was upgradable with an official standalone 250 GB hard drive, and a vertical stand was also released for the model. In the United Kingdom, the 500 GB model was released on September 28, 2012; and the 12 GB model was released on October 12, 2012. In the United States, the PS3 Super Slim was first released as a bundled console. The 250 GB model was bundled with the &quot;Game of the Year&quot; edition of &quot;Uncharted 3: Drake&#x27;s Deception&quot; and released on September 25, 2012; and the 500 GB model was bundled with &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot; and released on October 30, 2012. In Japan, the black colored Super Slim model was released on October 4, 2012; and the white colored Super Slim model was released on November 22, 2012. The Super Slim model is 20 percent smaller and 25 percent lighter than the Slim model and features a manual sliding disc cover instead of a motorized slot-loading disc cover of the Slim model. The white colored Super Slim model was released in the United States on January 27, 2013, as part of the &quot;Instant Game Collection Bundle&quot;. The &quot;Garnet Red&quot; and &quot;Azurite Blue&quot; colored models were launched in Japan on February 28, 2013. The &quot;Garnet Red&quot; version was released in North America on March 12, 2013, as part of the &quot;God of War: Ascension&quot; bundle with 500 GB storage and contained &quot;God of War: Ascension&quot; as well as the &quot;God of War Saga&quot;. The &quot;Azurite Blue&quot; model was released on October 8, 2013, as a GameStop exclusive with 250 GB storage.

== Games ==

PlayStation 3 launched in North America with 14 titles, with another three being released before the end of 2006. After the first week of sales it was confirmed that &quot;&quot; from Insomniac Games was the top-selling launch game in North America. The game was heavily praised by numerous video game websites, including GameSpot and IGN, both of whom awarded it their PlayStation 3 Game of the Year award for 2006. Some titles missed the launch window and were delayed until early 2007, such as &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot;, &quot;F.E.A.R.&quot; and &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;. During the Japanese launch, &quot;Ridge Racer 7&quot; was the top-selling game, while &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire&quot; also fared well in sales, both of which were offerings from Namco Bandai Games. PlayStation 3 launched in Europe with 24 titles, including ones that were not offered in North American and Japanese launches, such as &quot;Formula One Championship Edition&quot;, &quot;MotorStorm&quot; and &quot;Virtua Fighter 5&quot;. &quot;&quot; and &quot;MotorStorm&quot; were the most successful titles of 2007, and both games subsequently received sequels in the form of &quot;Resistance 2&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

At E3 2007, Sony was able to show a number of their upcoming video games for PlayStation 3, including &quot;Heavenly Sword&quot;, &quot;Lair&quot;, &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction&quot;, &quot;Warhawk&quot; and &quot;&quot;; all of which were released in the third and fourth quarters of 2007. It also showed off a number of titles that were set for release in 2008 and 2009; most notably &quot;Killzone 2&quot;, &quot;Infamous&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo 5 Prologue&quot;, &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot; and &quot;SOCOM U.S. Navy SEALs: Confrontation&quot;. A number of third-party exclusives were also shown, including the highly anticipated &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;, alongside other high-profile third-party titles such as &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare&quot;, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot;, &quot;Devil May Cry 4&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 5&quot;. Two other important titles for PlayStation 3, &quot;Final Fantasy XIII&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy Versus XIII&quot;, were shown at TGS 2007 in order to appease the Japanese market.

Sony have since launched their budget range of PlayStation 3 titles, known as the Greatest Hits range in North America, the Platinum range in Europe and Australia and The Best range in Japan. Among the titles available in the budget range include &quot;&quot;, &quot;MotorStorm&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Rainbow Six: Vegas&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty 3&quot;, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed&quot; and &quot;Ninja Gaiden Sigma&quot;. As of October 2009 &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;, &quot;Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction&quot;, &quot;Devil May Cry 4&quot;, &quot;Army of Two&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Midnight Club: Los Angeles&quot; have also joined the list.

, there have been 595 million games sold for PlayStation 3. The best selling PS3 games are &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot;, &quot;The Last of Us&quot;, &quot;Uncharted 3: Drake&#x27;s Deception&quot; and &quot;Uncharted 2: Among Thieves&quot;.

The last game released on the PlayStation 3 was &quot;&quot;, on August 20, 2020.

=== Stereoscopic 3D ===
In December 2008, the CTO of Blitz Games announced that it would bring stereoscopic 3D gaming and movie viewing to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 with its own technology. This was first demonstrated publicly on PS3 using Sony&#x27;s own technology in January 2009 at the Consumer Electronics Show. Journalists were shown &quot;Wipeout HD&quot; and &quot;Gran Turismo 5 Prologue&quot; in 3D as a demonstration of how the technology might work if it is implemented in the future. Firmware update 3.30 officially allowed PS3 titles to be played in 3D, requiring a compatible display for use. System software update 3.50 prepared it for 3D films. While the game itself must be programmed to take advantage of the 3D technology, titles may be patched to add in the functionality retroactively. Titles with such patches include &quot;Wipeout HD&quot;, &quot;Pain&quot;, and &quot;Super Stardust HD&quot;.

== Hardware ==

The basic design of the PlayStation 3 remained the same across all three major hardware revisions with a black plastic case with a convex top side when placed horizontal, which could also be placed vertical, with the convex on the left side. The original case design had piano black plastic with a &quot;Spider-Man&quot;-font-inspired logo that PlayStation designer Teiyu Goto stated that &quot;was one of the first elements SCEI president Ken Kutaragi decided on and the logo may have been the motivating force behind the shape of PS3&quot;.

=== Technical specifications ===


The PlayStation 3 uses the 64-bit Cell microprocessor, developed jointly by Sony, Toshiba and IBM, as its CPU. The processor consists of a 3.2 GHz PowerPC-based Power Processing Element (PPE) and seven Synergistic Processing Elements (SPEs). To improve manufacturing yields, the chip is initially manufactured with eight SPEs. After production, each chip is tested, and if one defective SPE is identified, it is disabled using laser trimming, allowing the processor to function with seven SPEs. This approach minimizes waste by utilizing processors that would otherwise be discarded. Even in chips without defects, one SPE is still disabled to ensure uniformity. Of the seven active SPEs, six are available for developers, while the seventh is reserved for the console’s operating system. The Cell processor has access to 256 MB of XDR DRAM main memory.

Graphics processing is managed by the RSX Reality Synthesizer, designed by Nvidia and paired with 256 MB of GDDR3 video memory. The RSX chip can produce resolutions ranging from standard-definition (480i/576i) up to high-definition (1080p). Initially, Sony’s hardware development team did not plan to include a dedicated GPU, believing the Cell microprocessor could handle all graphics processing tasks. However, game developers, including Sony’s ICE team (the central graphics technologies group for its game studios), demonstrated that without a dedicated GPU, the PlayStation 3’s performance would fall short, particularly when compared to the Xbox 360. This feedback prompted the late-stage addition of the RSX GPU during the console’s development.

Physical media games for the PlayStation 3 were sold on Blu-ray discs and the console features a 2× speed drive which is also capable of reading Blu-ray movies, DVDs, and CDs. 

It was originally available with hard drives of 20 and 60 GB but various sizes up to 500 GB were later made available (see: model comparison). All PS3 models have user-upgradeable hard drives.

The system has Bluetooth 2.0 (with support for up to seven Bluetooth devices), Gigabit Ethernet, USB 2.0 and HDMI 1.4 built in. Wi-Fi networking is also built-in on all but one early model. A couple of early models also had a built-in flash card reader (compatible with Memory Stick, SD and CompactFlash).

=== Models ===

PlayStation 3 has been produced in various models: the original, the Slim, and the Super Slim. Successive models have added or removed various features, reduced the console&#x27;s initial purchase price and weight, and increased storage capacity (with exceptions).

=== Controllers and accessories ===
Numerous accessories for the console have been developed. These accessories include the wireless Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers, the Logitech Driving Force GT, the Logitech Cordless Precision Controller, the Blu-ray Disc Remote, the PlayStation Eye camera, and the PlayTV DVB-T tuner/digital video recorder accessory.

At Sony&#x27;s E3 press conference in 2006, the then-standard wireless Sixaxis controller was announced. The controller was based on the same basic design as the DualShock 2 controller for the PlayStation 2 but was wireless, lacked vibration capabilities, and had a built-in accelerometer that could detect motion in three directional and three rotational axes (six in total, hence the name Sixaxis). 

At its press conference at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, Sony announced the DualShock 3 controller with the same function and design as Sixaxis, but with vibration capability added. The controller is heavier than the standard Sixaxis controller and capable of vibration forces comparable to DualShock 2. It was released in Japan in November 2007 and rolled out to the rest of the world throughout 2008.

During E3 2009, Sony unveiled a motion controller, the PlayStation Move, partly in response to the popularity of the competing Nintendo Wii. The Move’s &quot;wand&quot; controllers use internal inertial sensors detect motion while the position of a glowing orb is tracked using a PlayStation Eye or PlayStation Camera. It went on sale in late 2010.

=== Statistics regarding reliability ===
According to &quot;Ars Technica&quot;, the number of PlayStation 3 consoles that have experienced failure is well within the normal failure rates in the consumer electronics industry; a 2009 study by SquareTrade, a warranty provider, found a two-year failure rate of 10% for PlayStation 3s.

In September 2009, BBC&#x27;s &quot;Watchdog&quot; television program aired a report investigating the issue, calling it the &quot;yellow light of death&quot; (YLOD). Among the consoles that experienced the failure, they found that it usually occurred 18–24 months after purchase, while the standard Sony warranty covers one year after purchase. After this time period, PlayStation 3 owners can pay Sony a fixed fee for a refurbished console.

Sony claimed that, according to its statistics of returned consoles, approximately 0.5% of consoles were reported as showing the YLOD. In response to the televised report, Sony issued a document criticizing the program&#x27;s accuracy and conclusions; specifically that the faults were evidence of a manufacturing defect. The document also complained that the report had been inappropriate in tone and might damage Sony&#x27;s brand name.
=== Use in supercomputing ===
PS3&#x27;s hardware has also been used to build supercomputers for high-performance computing. Fixstars Solutions sells a version of Yellow Dog Linux for PlayStation 3 (originally sold by Terra Soft Solutions). RapidMind produced a stream programming package for PS3, but were acquired by Intel in 2009. Also, on January 3, 2007, Dr. Frank Mueller, Associate Professor of Computer Science at NCSU, clustered 8 PS3s. Mueller commented that the 256 MB of system RAM is a limitation for this particular application and is considering attempting to retrofit more RAM. Software includes: Fedora Core 5 Linux ppc64, MPICH2, OpenMP v 2.5, GNU Compiler Collection and CellSDK 1.1. As a more cost-effective alternative to conventional supercomputers, the U.S. military has purchased clusters of PS3 units for research purposes. Retail PS3 Slim units cannot be used for supercomputing, because PS3 Slim lacks the ability to boot into a third-party OS.

On March 22, 2007, SCE and Stanford University released the Folding@home software for PlayStation 3. This program allows PS3 owners to lend the computing power of their consoles to help study the process of protein folding for disease research.

In December 2008, a group of hackers used a cluster of 200 PlayStation 3 computers to crack SSL authentication.

In November 2010 the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) created a powerful supercomputer by connecting together 1,760 Sony PS3s which include 168 separate graphical processing units and 84 coordinating servers in a parallel array capable of performing 500 trillion floating-point operations per second (500 TFLOPS). As built the Condor Cluster was the 33rd largest supercomputer in the world and would be used to analyze high definition satellite imagery.
== Software ==
=== System software ===
Sony has included the ability for the operating system, referred to as &quot;System Software&quot;, to be updated. The updates can be acquired in several ways:
* If PlayStation 3 has an active Internet connection, updates may be downloaded directly from the PlayStation Network to PlayStation 3 and subsequently installed. Systems with active Internet will automatically check online for software updates each time the console is started.
* Using an external PC, a user may download the update from the official PlayStation website, transfer it to portable storage media and install it on the system.
* Some game discs come with system software updates on the disc. This may be due to the game requiring an update in order to run. If so, the software may be installed from the disc.

The original PlayStation 3 also included the ability to install other operating systems, such as Linux. This was not included in the newer slim models and was removed from all older PlayStation 3 consoles with the release of firmware update 3.21 in April 2010. The functionality is now only available to users of original consoles who choose not to update their system software beyond version 3.15 or who have installed third-party, modified and unofficial versions of the firmware instead.

==== Graphical user interface ====

The standard PlayStation 3 version of the XrossMediaBar (pronounced &quot;Cross Media Bar&quot; and abbreviated XMB) includes nine categories of options. These are: &quot;Users&quot;, &quot;Settings&quot;, &quot;Photo&quot;, &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Video&quot;, &quot;TV/Video Services&quot;, &quot;Game&quot;, &quot;Network&quot;, &quot;PlayStation Network&quot; and &quot;Friends&quot; (similar to the PlayStation Portable media bar). The&quot;TV/Video Services&quot; category is for services like Netflix and if PlayTV or torne is installed; the first category in this section is &quot;My Channels&quot;, which lets users download various streaming services, including Sony&#x27;s own streaming services Crackle and PlayStation Vue. By default, the &quot;What&#x27;s New&quot; section of &quot;PlayStation Network&quot; is displayed when the system starts up. PS3 includes the ability to store various master and secondary user profiles, manage and explore photos with or without a musical slide show, play music and copy audio CD tracks to an attached data storage device, play movies and video files from the hard disk drive, an optical disc (Blu-ray Disc or DVD-Video) or an optional USB mass storage or Flash card, compatibility for a USB keyboard and mouse and a web browser supporting compatible-file download function. Additionally, UPnP media will appear in the respective audio/video/photo categories if a compatible media server or DLNA server is detected on the local network. The Friends menu allows mail with emoticon and attached picture features and video chat which requires an optional PlayStation Eye or EyeToy webcam. The Network menu allows online shopping through the PlayStation Store and connectivity to PlayStation Portable via Remote Play.

=== Digital rights management ===
PlayStation 3 console protects certain types of data and uses digital rights management to limit the data&#x27;s use. Purchased games and content from the PlayStation Network store are governed by PlayStation&#x27;s Network Digital Rights Management (NDRM). The NDRM allows users to access the data from up to 2 different PlayStation 3&#x27;s that have been activated using a user&#x27;s PlayStation Network ID. PlayStation 3 also limits the transfer of copy protected videos downloaded from its store to other machines and states that copy protected video &quot;may not restore correctly&quot; following certain actions after making a backup such as downloading a new copy protected movie.

=== Photo management ===
;Photo Gallery

Photo Gallery is an optional application to view, create, and group photos from PS3, which is installed separately from the system software at 105 MB. It was introduced in system software version 2.60 and provides a range of tools for sorting through and displaying the system&#x27;s pictures. The key feature of this application is that it can organize photos into groups according to various criteria. Notable categorizations are colors, ages, or facial expressions of the people in the photos. Slideshows can be viewed with the application, along with music and playlists. The software was updated with the release of system software version 3.40 allowing users to upload and browse photos on Facebook and Picasa.

;PlayMemories Studio
PlayMemories is an optional stereoscopic 3D (and also standard) photo viewing application, which is installed from the PlayStation Store at 956 MB. The application is dedicated specifically to 3D photos and features the ability to zoom into 3D environments and change the angle and perspective of panoramas. It requires system software 3.40 or higher; 3D photos; a 3D HDTV, and an HDMI cable for the 3D images to be viewed properly.

=== Video services ===
;Video editor and uploader
A new application was released as part of system software version 3.40 which allows users to edit videos on PlayStation 3 and upload them to the Internet. The software features basic video editing tools including the ability to cut videos and add music and captions. Videos can then be rendered and uploaded to video sharing websites such as Facebook and YouTube.

;Video on demand
In addition to the video service provided by the Sony Entertainment Network, the PlayStation 3 console has access to a variety of third-party video services, dependent on the region:

Since June 2009, VidZone has offered a free music video streaming service in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In October 2009, Sony Computer Entertainment and Netflix announced that the Netflix streaming service would also be available on PlayStation 3 in the United States. A paid Netflix subscription was required for the service. The service became available in November 2009. Initially users had to use a free Blu-ray disc to access the service; however, in October 2010 the requirement to use a disc to gain access was removed.

In April 2010, support for MLB.tv was added, allowing MLB.tv subscribers to watch regular season games live in HD and access new interactive features designed exclusively for PSN.

In November 2010, access to the video and social networking site MUBI was enabled for European, New Zealand, and Australian users; the service integrates elements of social networking with rental or subscription video streaming, allowing users to watch and discuss films with other users. Also in November 2010 the video rental service VUDU, NHL GameCenter Live, and subscription service Hulu Plus launched on PlayStation 3 in the United States.

In August 2011, Sony, in partnership with DirecTV, added NFL Sunday Ticket. Then in October 2011, Best Buy launched an app for its CinemaNow service. In April 2012, Amazon.com launched an Amazon Video app, accessible to Amazon Prime subscribers (in the US).

Upon reviewing the PlayStation and Netflix collaboration, Pocket-Lint said &quot;We&#x27;ve used the Netflix app on Xbox too and, as good as it is, we think the PS3 version might have the edge here.&quot; and stated that having Netflix and LoveFilm on PlayStation is &quot;mind-blowingly good.&quot;

In July 2013, YuppTV OTT player launched its branded application on the PS3 computer entertainment system in the United States.

=== Audio capabilities ===
The PlayStation 3 has the ability to play standard audio CDs, a feature that was notably removed from its successors. PlayStation 3 added the ability for ripping audio CDs to store them on the system&#x27;s hard disk; the system has transcoders for ripping to either MP3, AAC, or Sony&#x27;s own ATRAC (ATRAC3plus) formats. Early models were also able to playback Super Audio CDs, however this support was dropped in the third generation revision of the console from late 2007. However, all models do retain Direct Stream Digital playback ability.

PlayStation 3 can also play music from portable players by connecting the player to the system&#x27;s USB port, including from Walkman digital audio players and other ATRAC players and other players that use the UMS protocol. The PlayStation 3 did not feature the Sony CONNECT Music Store.

=== OtherOS support ===
PlayStation 3 initially shipped with the ability to install an alternative operating system alongside the main system software; Linux and other Unix-based operating systems were available. The hardware allowed access to six of the seven &quot;Synergistic Processing Elements&quot; of the Cell microprocessor, but not the RSX &#x27;Reality Synthesizer&#x27; graphics chip.

The &#x27;OtherOS&#x27; functionality was not present in the updated PS Slim models, and the feature was subsequently removed from previous versions of the PS3 as part of the machine&#x27;s firmware update version 3.21 which was released on April 1, 2010; Sony cited security concerns as the rationale. The firmware update 3.21 was mandatory for access to the PlayStation Network.

The removal caused some controversy; as the update removed officially advertised features from already sold products, and gave rise to several class action lawsuits aimed at making Sony return the feature or provide compensation.
On December 8, 2011, U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg dismissed the last remaining count of the class action lawsuit (other claims in the suit had previously been dismissed), stating: &quot;As a legal matter, ... plaintiffs have failed to allege facts or articulate a theory on which Sony may be held liable.&quot;

, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit partially reversed the dismissal and have sent the case back to the district court.

=== Leap year bug ===
On March 1, 2010 (UTC), many of the original PlayStation 3 models worldwide were experiencing errors related to their internal system clock. The error had many symptoms. Initially, the main problem seemed to be the inability to connect to the PlayStation Network. However, the root cause of the problem was unrelated to the PlayStation Network, since even users who had never been online also had problems playing installed offline games (which queried the system timer as part of startup) and using system themes. At the same time, many users noted that the console&#x27;s clock had gone back to December 31, 1999. The event was nicknamed the ApocalyPS3, a play on the word &quot;&quot; and PS3, the abbreviation for the PlayStation 3 console.

The error code displayed was typically 8001050F and affected users were unable to sign in, play games, use dynamic themes, and view/sync trophies. The problem only resided within the first- through third-generation original PS3 units while the newer &quot;Slim&quot; models were unaffected because of different internal hardware for the clock.

Sony confirmed that there was an error and stated that it was narrowing down the issue and were continuing to work to restore service. By March 2 (UTC), 2010, owners of original PS3 models could connect to PSN successfully and the clock no longer showed December 31, 1999. Sony stated that the affected models incorrectly identified 2010 as a leap year, because of a bug in the BCD method of storing the date. However, for some users, the hardware&#x27;s operating system clock (mainly updated from the internet and not associated with the internal clock) needed to be updated manually or by re-syncing it via the internet.

On June 29, 2010, Sony released PS3 system software update 3.40, which improved the functionality of the internal clock to properly account for leap years.

== Features ==
=== PlayStation Portable connectivity ===

PlayStation Portable can connect with PlayStation 3 in many ways, including in-game connectivity. For example, &quot;Formula One Championship Edition&quot;, a racing game, was shown at E3 2006 using a PSP as a real-time rear-view mirror. In addition, users are able to download original PlayStation format games from the PlayStation Store, transfer and play them on PSP as well as PS3 itself. It is also possible to use the Remote Play feature to play these and some PlayStation Network games, remotely on PSP over a network or internet connection.

Sony has also demonstrated PSP playing back video content from PlayStation 3 hard disk across an ad hoc wireless network. This feature is referred to as Remote Play located under the browser icon on both PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. Remote play has since expanded to allow remote access to PS3 via PSP from any wireless access point in the world.

== PlayStation Network ==

PlayStation Network is the unified online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery service provided by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, announced during the 2006 PlayStation Business Briefing meeting in Tokyo. The service is always connected, free, and includes multiplayer support. The network enables online gaming, the PlayStation Store, PlayStation Home and other services. PlayStation Network uses real currency and PlayStation Network Cards as seen with the PlayStation Store and PlayStation Home.

=== PlayStation Plus ===

PlayStation Plus (commonly abbreviated &quot;PS+&quot; and occasionally referred to as &quot;PSN Plus&quot;) is a premium PlayStation Network subscription service that was officially unveiled at E3 2010 by Jack Tretton, President and CEO of SCEA. Rumors of such service had been in speculation since Kaz Hirai&#x27;s announcement at TGS 2009 of a possible paid service for PSN but with the current PSN service still available. Launched alongside PS3 firmware 3.40 and PSP firmware 6.30 on June 29, 2010, the paid-for subscription service provides users with enhanced services on the PlayStation Network, on top of the current PSN service which is still available with all of its features. These enhancements include the ability to have demos and game updates download automatically to PlayStation 3. Subscribers also get early or exclusive access to some betas, game demos, premium downloadable content, and other PlayStation Store items. North American users also get a free subscription to Qore. Users may choose to purchase either a one-year or a three-month subscription to PlayStation Plus.

=== PlayStation Store ===
The PlayStation Store is an online virtual market available to users of Sony&#x27;s PlayStation 3 (PS3) and PlayStation Portable (PSP) game consoles via the PlayStation Network. The Store offers a range of downloadable content both for purchase and available free of charge. Available content includes full games, add-on content, playable demos, themes and game and movie trailers. The service is accessible through an icon on the XMB on PS3 and PSP. The PS3 store can also be accessed on PSP via a Remote Play connection to PS3. The PSP store is also available via the PC application, Media Go. , there have been over 600 million downloads from the PlayStation Store worldwide.

The PlayStation Store is updated with new content each Tuesday in North America, and each Wednesday in PAL regions. In May 2010 this was changed from Thursdays to allow PSP games to be released digitally, closer to the time they are released on UMD.

On March 29, 2021, Sony announced that it would shut down the PS3 version of the Store on July 2, though previous purchases on the store will remain downloadable. However, on April 19, following fan feedback, Sony reversed their decision and confirmed that the PS3 store would remain operational.

=== What&#x27;s New ===

What&#x27;s New was announced at Gamescom 2009 and was released on September 1, 2009, with PlayStation 3 system software 3.0. The feature was to replace the existing [Information Board], which displayed news from the PlayStation website associated with the user&#x27;s region. The concept was developed further into a major PlayStation Network feature, which interacts with the [Status Indicator] to display a ticker of all content, excluding recently played content (currently in North America and Japan only).

The system displays the What&#x27;s New screen by default instead of the [Games] menu (or [Video] menu, if a movie was inserted) when starting up. What&#x27;s New has four sections: &quot;Our Pick&quot;, &quot;Recently Played&quot;, the latest information, and new content available in PlayStation Store. There are four kinds of content the What&#x27;s New screen displays and links to, on the sections. &quot;Recently Played&quot; displays the user&#x27;s recently played games and online services only, whereas, the other sections can contain website links, links to play videos, and access to selected sections of the PlayStation Store.

The PlayStation Store icons in the [Game] and [Video] section act similarly to the What&#x27;s New screen, except that they only display and link to games and videos in the PlayStation Store, respectively.

=== PlayStation Home ===

PlayStation Home was a virtual 3D social networking service for the PlayStation Network. Home allowed users to create a custom avatar, which could be groomed realistically. Users could edit and decorate their personal apartments, avatars, or club houses with free, premium, or won content. Users could shop for new items or win prizes from PS3 games, or Home activities. Users could interact and connect with friends and customize content in a virtual world. Home also acted as a meeting place for users that wanted to play multiplayer video games with others.

A closed beta began in Europe from May 2007 and expanded to other territories soon after. Home was delayed and expanded several times before initially releasing. The Open Beta test was started on December 11, 2008. It remained as a perpetual beta until its closure on March 31, 2015. Home was available directly from the PlayStation 3 XrossMediaBar. Membership was free, but required a PSN account.

Home featured places to meet and interact, dedicated game spaces, developer spaces, company spaces, and events. The service underwent a weekly maintenance and frequent updates. At the time of its closure in March 2015, Home had been downloaded by over 41 million users. 

=== Life with PlayStation ===
Life with PlayStation, released on September 18, 2008 to succeed Folding@home, was retired November 6, 2012. &quot;Life with PlayStation&quot; used virtual globe data to display news and information by city. Along with Folding@home functionality, the application provided access to three other information &quot;channels&quot;, the first being the &quot;Live Channel&quot; offering news headlines and weather which were provided by Google News, The Weather Channel, the University of Wisconsin–Madison Space Science and Engineering Center, among other sources. The second channel was the World Heritage channel which offered historical information about historical sites. The third channel was the United Village channel. United Village was designed to share information about communities and cultures worldwide. An update allowed video and photo viewing in the application. The fourth channel was the U.S. exclusive PlayStation Network Game Trailers Channel for direct streaming of game trailers.

=== Outage ===

On April 20, 2011, Sony shut down the PlayStation Network and Qriocity for a prolonged interval, revealing on April 23 that this was due to &quot;an external intrusion on our system&quot;. Sony later revealed that the personal information of 77 million users might have been taken, including: names; addresses; countries; email addresses; birthdates; PSN/Qriocity logins, passwords and handles/PSN online IDs.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSN/Qriocity Service Update&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It also stated that it was possible that users&#x27; profile data, including purchase history and billing address, and PlayStation Network/Qriocity password security answers may have been obtained. There was no evidence that any credit card data had been taken, but the possibility could not be ruled out, and Sony advised customers that their credit card data may have been obtained. Additionally, the credit card numbers were encrypted and Sony never collected the three digit CVC or CSC number from the back of the credit cards which is required for authenticating some transactions. In response to the incident, Sony announced a &quot;Welcome Back&quot; program, 30 days free membership of PlayStation Plus for all PSN members, two free downloadable PS3 games, and a free one-year enrollment in an identity theft protection program.

== Sales and production costs ==


Although its PlayStation predecessors had been very dominant against the competition and were hugely profitable for Sony, PlayStation 3 had an inauspicious start, and Sony chairman and CEO Sir Howard Stringer initially could not convince investors of a turnaround in its fortunes. The PS3 lacked the unique gameplay of the more affordable Wii which became that generation&#x27;s most successful console in terms of units sold. Furthermore, PS3 had to compete directly with Xbox 360 which had a market head start, and as a result the platform no longer had exclusive titles that the PS2 enjoyed such as the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; and &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series (regarding cross-platform games, Xbox 360 versions were generally considered superior in 2006, although by 2008 the PS3 versions had reached parity or surpassed), and it took longer than expected for PS3 to enjoy strong sales and close the gap with Xbox 360. Sony also continued to lose money on each PS3 sold through 2010, although the redesigned &quot;slim&quot; PS3 cut these losses.

PlayStation 3&#x27;s initial production cost is estimated by iSuppli to have been US$805.85 for the 20 GB model and US$840.35 for the 60 GB model. However, they were priced at US$499 and US$599, respectively, meaning that units may have been sold at an estimated loss of $306 or $241 depending on model, if the cost estimates were correct, and thus may have contributed to Sony&#x27;s games division posting an operating loss of ¥232.3 billion (US$1.97 billion) in the fiscal year ending March 2007. In April 2007, soon after these results were published, Ken Kutaragi, President of Sony Computer Entertainment, announced plans to retire. Various news agencies, including &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that this was due to poor sales, while SCEI maintains that Kutaragi had been planning his retirement for six months prior to the announcement.

In January 2008, Kaz Hirai, CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment, suggested that the console may start making a profit by early 2009, stating that, &quot;the next fiscal year starts in April and if we can try to achieve that in the next fiscal year that would be a great thing&quot; and that &quot;[profitability] is not a definite commitment, but that is what I would like to try to shoot for&quot;. However, market analysts Nikko Citigroup have predicted that PlayStation 3 could be profitable by August 2008. In a July 2008 interview, Hirai stated that his objective is for PlayStation 3 to sell 150 million units by its ninth year, surpassing PlayStation 2&#x27;s sales of 140 million in its nine years on the market. In January 2009 Sony announced that their gaming division was profitable in Q3 2008.

After the system&#x27;s launch, production costs were reduced significantly as a result of phasing out the Emotion Engine chip and falling hardware costs. The cost of manufacturing Cell microprocessors had fallen dramatically as a result of moving to the 65 nm production process, and Blu-ray Disc diodes had become cheaper to manufacture. As of January 2008, each unit cost around $400 to manufacture; by August 2009, Sony had reduced costs by a total of 70%, meaning it only cost Sony around $240 per unit. The PlayStation 3&#x27;s actual manufacturing cost at launch was never officially disclosed; SCE&#x27;s Phil Harrison said in a 2019 interview that during the system&#x27;s launch &quot;it was a worry because 600 bucks was actually too cheap, because the machine was &quot;so&quot; expensive to make&quot;, before telling the interviewer that he can&#x27;t disclose the real figure but that it would &quot;make your eyebrows shoot clear off the top of your head&quot;.

== Critical reception ==
Early PlayStation 3 reviews after launch were critical of its high price and lack of quality games. Game developers regarded the architecture as difficult to program for. PS3 was, however, commended for its hardware including its Blu-ray home theater capabilities and graphics potential.

Critical and commercial reception to PS3 improved over time, after a series of price revisions, Blu-ray&#x27;s victory over HD DVD, and the release of several well received titles. &quot;Ars Technica&quot;″s original launch review gave PS3 only a 6/10, but second review of the console in June 2008 rated it a 9/10. In September 2009, IGN named PlayStation 3 the 15th-best gaming console of all time, behind both of its competitors: Wii (10th) and Xbox 360 (6th). However, PS3 has won IGN&#x27;s &quot;Console Showdown&quot;—based on which console offers the best selection of games released during each year—in three of the four years since it began (2008, 2009 and 2011, with Xbox winning in 2010). IGN judged PlayStation 3 to have the best game line-up of 2008, based on their review scores in comparison to those of Wii and Xbox 360. In a comparison piece by &quot;PC Magazine&quot;″s Will Greenwald in June 2012, PS3 was selected as an overall better console compared to Xbox 360.
Pocket-Lint said of the console &quot;The PS3 has always been a brilliant games console,&quot; and that &quot;For now, this is just about the best media device for the money.&quot;

=== Original model ===
PS3 was given the number-eight spot on &quot;PC World&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The Top 21 Tech Screwups of 2006&quot;, where it was criticized for being &quot;Late, Expensive and Incompatible&quot;. GamesRadar ranked PS3 as the top item in a feature on game-related PR disasters, asking how Sony managed to &quot;take one of the most anticipated game systems of all time and—within the space of a year—turn it into a hate object reviled by the entire internet&quot;, but added that despite its problems the system has &quot;untapped potential&quot;. &quot;Business Week&quot; summed up the general opinion by stating that it was &quot;more impressed with what the PlayStation 3 could do than with what it currently does&quot;.

Developers also found the machine difficult to program for. In 2007, Gabe Newell of Valve said &quot;The PS3 is a total disaster on so many levels, I think it&#x27;s really clear that Sony lost track of what customers and what developers wanted&quot;. He continued &quot;I&#x27;d say, even at this late date, they should just cancel it and do a do over. Just say, &#x27;This was a horrible disaster and we&#x27;re sorry and we&#x27;re going to stop selling this and stop trying to convince people to develop for it&#x27;&quot;. Doug Lombardi VP of Marketing for Valve has since stated that Valve is interested in developing for the console and is looking to hire talented PS3 programmers for future projects. He later restated Valve&#x27;s position, &quot;Until we have the ability to get a PS3 team together, until we find the people who want to come to Valve or who are at Valve who want to work on that, I don&#x27;t really see us moving to that platform&quot;. At Sony&#x27;s E3 2010 press conference, Newell made a live appearance to recant his previous statements, citing Sony&#x27;s move to make the system more developer-friendly, and to announce that Valve would be developing &quot;Portal 2&quot; for the system. He also claimed that the inclusion of Steamworks (Valve&#x27;s system to automatically update their software independently) would help to make the PS3 version of &quot;Portal 2&quot; the best console version on the market.

Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has criticized PS3&#x27;s high development costs and inferior attach rate and return to that of Xbox 360 and Wii. He believes these factors are pushing developers away from working on the console. In an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; Kotick stated &quot;I&#x27;m getting concerned about Sony; the PlayStation 3 is losing a bit of momentum and they don&#x27;t make it easy for me to support the platform.&quot; He continued, &quot;It&#x27;s expensive to develop for the console, and the Wii and the Xbox are just selling better. Games generate a better return on invested capital (ROIC) on the Xbox than on the PlayStation.&quot; Kotick also claimed that Activision Blizzard may stop supporting the system if the situation is not addressed. &quot;[Sony has] to cut the [PS3&#x27;s retail] price, because if they don&#x27;t, the attach rates are likely to slow. If we are being realistic, we might have to stop supporting Sony.&quot; Kotick received heavy criticism for the statement, notably from developer BioWare who questioned the wisdom of the threatened move, and referred to the statement as &quot;silly.&quot;

Despite the initial negative press, several websites have given the system very good reviews mostly regarding its hardware. CNET United Kingdom praised the system saying, &quot;the PS3 is a versatile and impressive piece of home-entertainment equipment that lives up to the hype [...] the PS3 is well worth its hefty price tag.&quot; CNET awarded it a score of 8.8 out of 10 and voted it as its number one &quot;must-have&quot; gadget, praising its robust graphical capabilities and stylish exterior design while criticizing its limited selection of available games. In addition, both &quot;Home Theater Magazine&quot; and &quot;Ultimate AV&quot; have given the system&#x27;s Blu-ray playback very favorable reviews, stating that the quality of playback exceeds that of many current standalone Blu-ray Disc players.

In an interview, Kazuo Hirai, chairman of Sony Computer Entertainment argued for the choice of a complex architecture. Hexus Gaming reviewed the PAL version and summed the review up by saying, &quot;as the PlayStation 3 matures and developers start really pushing it, we&#x27;ll see the PlayStation 3 emerge as the console of choice for gaming.&quot; At GDC 2007, Shiny Entertainment founder Dave Perry stated, &quot;I think that Sony has made the best machine. It&#x27;s the best piece of hardware, without question&quot;.

=== Slim model and rebranding ===
The PlayStation 3 Slim received extremely positive reviews as well as a boost in sales; less than 24 hours after its announcement, PS3 Slim took the number-one bestseller spot on Amazon.com in the video games section for fifteen consecutive days. It regained the number-one position again one day later. PS3 Slim also received praise from PC World giving it a 90 out of 100 praising its new repackaging and the new value it brings at a lower price as well as praising its quietness and the reduction in its power consumption. This is in stark contrast to the original PS3&#x27;s launch in which it was given position number-eight on their &quot;The Top 21 Tech Screwups of 2006&quot; list.

CNET awarded PS3 Slim four out of five stars praising its Blu-ray capabilities, 120 GB hard drive, free online gaming service and more affordable pricing point, but complained about the lack of backward compatibility for PlayStation 2 games. TechRadar gave PS3 Slim four and a half stars out of five praising its new smaller size and summed up its review stating &quot;Over all, the PS3 Slim is a phenomenal piece of kit. It&#x27;s amazing that something so small can do so much&quot;. However, they criticized the exterior design and the build quality in relation to the original model.

Eurogamer called it &quot;a product where the cost-cutting has—by and large—been tastefully done&quot; and said &quot;It&#x27;s nothing short of a massive win for Sony.&quot;

=== Super Slim model ===
The Super Slim model of PS3 has received positive reviews. Gaming website &quot;Spong&quot; praised the new Super Slim&#x27;s quietness, stating &quot;The most noticeable noise comes when the drive seeks a new area of the disc, such as when starting to load a game, and this occurs infrequently.&quot; They added that the fans are quieter than those of Slim, and went on to praise the new smaller, lighter size.
Criticism was placed on the new disc loader, stating: &quot;The cover can be moved by hand if you wish, there&#x27;s also an eject button to do the work for you, but there is no software eject from the triangle button menus in the Xross Media Bar (XMB) interface. In addition, you have to close the cover by hand, which can be a bit fiddly if it&#x27;s upright, and the PS3 won&#x27;t start reading a disc unless you do [close the cover].&quot; They also said there is no real drop in retail price.

Tech media website CNET gave new Super Slim 4 out of 5 stars (&quot;Excellent&quot;), saying &quot;The Super Slim PlayStation 3 shrinks a powerful gaming machine into an even tinier package while maintaining the same features as its predecessors: a great gaming library and a strong array of streaming services [...]&quot;, whilst also criticising the &quot;cheap&quot; design and disc-loader, stating: &quot;Sometimes [the cover] doesn&#x27;t catch and you feel like you&#x27;re using one of those old credit card imprinter machines. In short, it feels cheap. You don&#x27;t realize how convenient autoloading disc trays are until they&#x27;re gone. Whether it was to cut costs or save space, this move is ultimately a step back.&quot; The criticism also was due to price, stating the cheapest Super Slim model was still more expensive than the cheapest Slim model, and that the smaller size and bigger hard drive should not be considered an upgrade when the hard drive on a Slim model is easily removed and replaced. They did praise that the hard drive of the Super Slim model is &quot;the easiest yet. Simply sliding off the side panel reveals the drive bay, which can quickly be unscrewed.&quot; They also stated that whilst the Super Slim model is not in any way an upgrade, it could be an indicator as to what&#x27;s to come. &quot;It may not be revolutionary, but the Super Slim PS3 is the same impressive machine in a much smaller package. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any reason for existing PS3 owners to upgrade, but for the prospective PS3 buyer, the Super Slim is probably the way to go if you can deal with not having a slot-loading disc drive.&quot;

Pocket-Lint gave Super Slim a very positive review saying &quot;It&#x27;s much more affordable, brilliant gaming, second-to-none video and media player.&quot; They think it is &quot;A blinding good console and one that will serve you for years to come with second-hand games and even new releases. Without doubt, if you don&#x27;t have a PS3, this is the time to buy.&quot; They gave Super Slim 4-and-a-half stars out of 5.

Technology magazine &quot;T3&quot; gave the Super Slim model a positive review, stating the console is almost &quot;nostalgic&quot; in the design similarities to the original &quot;fat&quot; model, &quot;While we don&#x27;t know whether it will play PS3 games or Blu-ray discs any differently yet, the look and feel of the new PS3 Slim is an obvious homage to the original PS3, minus the considerable excess weight. Immediately we would be concerned about the durability of the top loading tray that feels like it could be yanked straight out off the console, but ultimately it all feels like Sony&#x27;s nostalgic way of signing off the current-generation console in anticipation for the PS4.&quot;

<text>Edson Arantes do Nascimento (; 23 October 1940 – 29 December 2022), better known by his nickname Pelé (), was a Brazilian professional footballer who played as a forward. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, he was among the most successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century. His 1,279 goals in 1,363 games, which includes friendlies, is recognised as a Guinness World Record. In 1999, he was named Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee and was included in the &quot;Time&quot; list of the 100 most important people of the 20th century. In 2000, Pelé was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS) and was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the Century, alongside Diego Maradona. 

Pelé began playing for Santos at age 15 and the Brazil national team at 16. During his international career, he won three FIFA World Cups: 1958, 1962 and 1970, the only player to do so and the youngest player to win a World Cup (17). He was nicknamed  (The King) following the 1958 tournament. With 77 goals in 92 games for Brazil, Pelé held the record as the national team&#x27;s top goalscorer for over fifty years. At club level, he is Santos&#x27;s all-time top goalscorer with 643 goals in 659 games. In a golden era for Santos, he led the club to the 1962 and 1963 Copa Libertadores, and to the 1962 and 1963 Intercontinental Cup. Credited with connecting the phrase &quot;The Beautiful Game&quot; with football, Pelé&#x27;s &quot;electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals&quot; made him a global star, and his teams toured internationally to take full advantage of his popularity. During his playing days, Pelé was for a period the best-paid athlete in the world. After retiring in 1977, Pelé was a worldwide ambassador for football and made many acting and commercial ventures. In 2010, he was named the honorary president of the New York Cosmos.

Pelé averaged almost a goal per game throughout his career and could strike the ball with either foot, as well as being able to anticipate his opponents&#x27; movements. While predominantly a striker, he could also be a playmaker, providing assists with his vision and passing ability. He would often use his dribbling skills to go past opponents. In Brazil, he was hailed as a national hero for his accomplishments in football and for his outspoken support of policies that improve the social conditions of the poor. His emergence at the 1958 World Cup, where he became a black global sporting star, was a source of inspiration. Throughout his career and in his retirement, Pelé received numerous individual and team awards for his performance on the field, his record-breaking achievements, and his legacy in the sport. 
== Early years ==

Pelé was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento on 23 October 1940 in Três Corações, Minas Gerais, the son of Fluminense footballer Dondinho (born João Ramos do Nascimento) and Celeste Arantes (1922–2024). He was the elder of two siblings, with brother Zoca also playing for Santos, albeit not as successfully. He was named after the American inventor Thomas Edison. His parents decided to remove the &quot;i&quot; and call him &quot;Edson&quot;, but there was a typo on his birth certificate, leading many documents to show his name as &quot;Edison&quot;, not &quot;Edson&quot;, as he was called. He was originally nicknamed &quot;Dico&quot; by his family. He received the nickname &quot;Pelé&quot; during his school days, it is claimed, after mispronouncing the name of his favourite player, Vasco da Gama goalkeeper Bilé. In his autobiography released in 2006, Pelé stated he had no idea what the name means, nor did his old friends, and the word has no meaning in Portuguese. He would later learn it means &quot;miracle&quot; () in Hebrew.

Pelé grew up in poverty in Bauru in the state of São Paulo. He earned extra money by working in tea shops as a servant. Taught to play by his father, he could not afford a proper football and usually played with either a sock stuffed with newspaper and tied with string or a grapefruit. He played for several amateur teams in his youth, including &quot;Sete de Setembro&quot;, &quot;Canto do Rio&quot;, &quot;São Paulinho&quot;, and &quot;Ameriquinha&quot;. Pelé led &quot;Bauru Atlético Clube&quot; juniors (coached by Waldemar de Brito) to two São Paulo state youth championships. In his mid-teens, he played for an indoor football team called Radium. Indoor football had just become popular in Bauru when Pelé began playing it. He was part of the first futsal (indoor football) competition in the region. Pelé and his team won the first championship and several others.

According to Pelé, futsal (indoor football) presented difficult challenges: he said it was a lot quicker than football on the grass, and that players were required to think faster because everyone is close to each other in the pitch. Pelé credits futsal for helping him think better on the spot. In addition, futsal allowed him to play with adults when he was about 14 years old. In one of the tournaments he participated in, he was initially considered too young to play, but eventually went on to end up top scorer with 14 or 15 goals. &quot;That gave me a lot of confidence&quot;, Pelé said, &quot;I knew then not to be afraid of whatever might come&quot;.

== Club career ==

=== Santos ===
==== 1956–1962: early years with Santos and declared a national treasure ====
In 1956, de Brito took Pelé to Santos, an industrial and port city located near São Paulo, to try out for professional club Santos FC, telling the club&#x27;s directors that the 15-year-old would be &quot;the greatest football player in the world&quot;. Pelé impressed Santos coach Lula during his trial at the Estádio Vila Belmiro, and he signed a professional contract with the club in June 1956. Pelé was highly promoted in the local media as a future superstar. He made his senior team debut on 7 September 1956 at the age of 15 against Corinthians de Santo André and had an impressive performance in a 7–1 victory, scoring the first goal in his prolific career during the match.

When the 1957 season started, Pelé was given a starting place in the first team and, at the age of 16, became the top scorer in the league. Ten months after signing professionally, the teenager was called up to the Brazil national team. After the 1958 and the 1962 World Cup, wealthy European clubs, such as Real Madrid, Juventus and Manchester United, tried to sign him in vain. In 1958, Inter Milan even managed to get him a regular contract, but Angelo Moratti was forced to tear the contract up at the request of Santos&#x27;s chairman following a revolt by Santos&#x27;s Brazilian fans. Valencia CF also arranged an agreement that would have brought Pelé to the club after the 1958 World Cup, however after his performances at the tournament, Santos declined to let the player leave. In 1961 the government of Brazil under President Jânio Quadros declared Pelé an &quot;official national treasure&quot; to prevent him from being transferred out of the country.

Pelé won his first major title with Santos in 1958 as the team won the Campeonato Paulista; he would finish the tournament as the top scorer, with 58 goals, a record that still stands today. A year later, he would help the team earn their first victory in the Torneio Rio-São Paulo with a 3–0 over Vasco da Gama. However, Santos was unable to retain the Paulista title. In 1960, Pelé scored 33 goals to help his team regain the Campeonato Paulista trophy but lost out on the Rio-São Paulo tournament after finishing in 8th place. In the 1960 season, Pelé scored 47 goals and helped Santos regain the Campeonato Paulista. The club went on to win the Taça Brasil that same year, beating Bahia in the finals; Pelé finished as the top scorer of the tournament with nine goals. The victory allowed Santos to participate in the Copa Libertadores, the most prestigious club tournament in the Western hemisphere.

==== 1962–1965: Copa Libertadores success ====

Santos&#x27;s most successful Copa Libertadores season started in 1962; the team was seeded in Group One alongside Cerro Porteño and Deportivo Municipal Bolivia, winning every match of their group but one (a 1–1 away tie versus Cerro). Santos defeated Universidad Católica in the semi-finals and met defending champions Peñarol in the finals. Pelé scored twice in the playoff match to secure the first title for a Brazilian club. Pelé finished as the second top scorer of the competition with four goals. That same year, Santos would successfully defend the Campeonato Paulista (with 37 goals from Pelé) and the Taça Brasil (Pelé scoring four goals in the final series against Botafogo). Santos would also win the 1962 Intercontinental Cup against Benfica. Wearing his number 10 shirt, Pelé produced one of the best performances of his career, scoring a hat-trick in Lisbon as Santos won 5–2.
Pelé states that his most memorable goal was scored at the Estádio Rua Javari on a Campeonato Paulista match against São Paulo rival Clube Atlético Juventus on 2 August 1959. As there is no video footage of this match, Pelé asked that a computer animation be made of this specific goal. In March 1961, Pelé scored the &quot;gol de placa&quot; (goal worthy of a plaque), against Fluminense at the Maracanã. Pelé received the ball on the edge of his own penalty area, and ran the length of the field, eluding opposition players with feints, before striking the ball beyond the goalkeeper. A plaque was commissioned with a dedication to &quot;the most beautiful goal in the history of the Maracanã&quot;.

As the defending champions, Santos qualified automatically to the semi-final stage of the 1963 Copa Libertadores. The &quot;balé branco&quot; (white ballet), the nickname given to Santos at the time, managed to retain the title after victories over Botafogo and Boca Juniors. Pelé helped Santos overcome a Botafogo team that featured Brazilian greats such as Garrincha and Jairzinho with a last-minute goal in the first leg of the semi-finals which made it 1–1. In the second leg, Pelé scored a hat-trick in the Estádio do Maracanã as Santos won, 0–4, in the second leg. Santos started the final series by winning, 3–2, in the first leg and defeating Boca Juniors 1–2, in La Bombonera. It was a rare feat in official competitions, with another goal from Pelé. Santos became the first Brazilian team to lift the Copa Libertadores in Argentine soil. Pelé finished the tournament with five goals. Santos lost the Campeonato Paulista after finishing in third place but went on to win the Rio-São Paulo tournament after a 0–3 win over Flamengo in the final, with Pelé scoring one goal. Pelé would also help Santos retain the Intercontinental Cup and the Taça Brasil against AC Milan and Bahia respectively.

In the 1964 Copa Libertadores, Santos was beaten in both legs of the semi-finals by Independiente. The club won the Campeonato Paulista, with Pelé netting 34 goals. Santos also shared the Rio-São Paulo title with Botafogo and won the Taça Brasil for the fourth consecutive year. In the 1965 Copa Libertadores, Santos reached the semi-finals and met Peñarol in a rematch of the 1962 final. After two matches, a playoff was needed to break the tie. Unlike 1962, Peñarol came out on top and eliminated Santos 2–1. Pelé would, however, finish as the top scorer of the tournament with eight goals.

==== 1965–1974: &quot;O Milésimo&quot; and final years with Santos ====

In December 1965, Santos won the Taça Brasil, their fifth straight Brazilian league title, with Pelé scoring the last goal in the final series. In 1966, Santos failed to retain the Taça Brasil as Pelé&#x27;s goals were not enough to prevent a 9–4 defeat by Cruzeiro (led by Tostão) in the final series. The club did, however, win the Campeonato Paulista in 1967, 1968, and 1969. On 19 November 1969, Pelé scored his 1,000th goal in all competitions, in what was a highly anticipated moment in Brazil. The goal dubbed &quot;O Milésimo&quot; (The Thousandth), occurred in a match against Vasco da Gama, when Pelé scored from a penalty kick, at the Maracanã Stadium.

Various sources have said that the two factions involved in the Nigerian Civil War agreed to a 48-hour ceasefire in 1969 so they could watch Pelé play an exhibition game in Lagos. An early source for this story was &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine in 1975. Santos ended up playing to a 2–2 draw with Lagos side Stationary Stores FC and Pelé scored his team&#x27;s goals. The civil war went on for one more year after this game. In his autobiography, Pelé was unsure that there was a ceasefire, but said that there was an increased security presence at the game. Some sources, including Santos&#x27;s website, say that the ceasefire was instead for the friendly in Benin City, bordering Biafra. Local researchers have not found contemporary reports of any ceasefire.

During his time at Santos, Pelé played alongside many gifted players, including Zito, Pepe, and Coutinho; the latter partnered him in numerous one-two plays, attacks, and goals. After Pelé&#x27;s 19th season with Santos, he left Brazilian football. Pelé&#x27;s 643 goals for Santos were the most goals scored for a single club until it was surpassed by Lionel Messi of Barcelona in December 2020. 

=== Tours with Santos ===
Even though he never played in a European league, Pelé played exhibition games in several countries all over the world in tours with Santos. He played in Spain against Real Madrid and Barcelona, in Italy against Juventus, Inter Milan, AC Milan and AS Roma. Pelé travelled to Egypt in 1973, and played with Santos against Al Ahly. This trip was days after his team&#x27;s trip to Kuwait to play a match against Qadsia.

In Kuwait, Pelé met by chance the Egyptian movie star Zubaida Tharwat, who was in Kuwait attending a cinematic event. The two had a couple of photos and he admired her beauty. She said in a television interview about this incident that: she had traveled to Kuwait City in 1973 at the invitation of the Kuwaiti Minister of Culture at the time, and when she went to the hotel where she was going to stay, she was surprised by the presence of many people and flowers inside the hotel, and among these people came to her &quot;Pelé&quot; wearing a collar of roses, and he removed it from him and put it on her.

When she asked what was going on and who was this person, whom she did not know because she did not like football, the hotel staff told her that he was the famous Brazilian football player, and that the hotel was crowded with his fans who wanted to see him. Zubaida Tharwat stated that after he saw her for the first time inside the hotel where they happened to be, he kept chasing her day and night, and wanted to take her with him to Brazil. By chance, the next stop for Pelé&#x27;s tour was to Cairo, and he met again with Tharwat, who stated that she could not communicate with him as he did not speak English at the time.

=== New York Cosmos ===

After the 1974 season (his 19th with Santos), Pelé retired from Brazilian club football although he continued to occasionally play for Santos in official competitive matches. A year later, he came out of semi-retirement to sign with the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League (NASL) for the 1975 season. At a chaotic press conference at New York&#x27;s 21 Club, the Cosmos unveiled Pelé. John O&#x27;Reilly, the club&#x27;s media spokesman, stated, &quot;We had superstars in the United States but nothing at the level of Pelé. Everyone wanted to touch him, shake his hand, get a photo with him.&quot; Though well past his prime at this point, Pelé was credited with significantly increasing public awareness and interest of the sport in the US. During his first public appearance in Boston, he was injured by a crowd of fans who had surrounded him and was evacuated on a stretcher.

Pelé made his debut for the Cosmos on 15 June 1975 against the Dallas Tornado at Downing Stadium, scoring one goal in a 2–2 draw. Pelé opened the door for many other stars to play in North America. Giorgio Chinaglia followed him to the Cosmos, then Franz Beckenbauer and his former Santos teammate Carlos Alberto. Over the next few years other players came to the league, including Johan Cruyff, Eusébio, Bobby Moore, George Best and Gordon Banks.

In 1975, one week before the Lebanese Civil War, Pelé played a friendly game for the Lebanese club Nejmeh against a team of Lebanese Premier League stars, scoring two goals which were not included in his official tally. On the day of the game, 40,000 spectators were at the stadium from early morning to watch the match.

Pelé led the Cosmos to the 1977 Soccer Bowl, in his third and final season with the club. In June 1977, the Cosmos attracted an NASL record 62,394 fans to Giants Stadium for a 3–0 victory past the Tampa Bay Rowdies with a 37-year-old Pelé scoring a hat-trick. In the first leg of the quarter-finals, they attracted a US record crowd of 77,891 for what turned into an 8–3 rout of the Fort Lauderdale Strikers at Giants Stadium. In the second leg of the semi-finals against the Rochester Lancers, the Cosmos won 4–1. Pelé finished his official playing career on 28 August 1977, by leading the New York Cosmos to their second Soccer Bowl title with a 2–1 win over the Seattle Sounders at the Civic Stadium in Portland, Oregon.

On 1 October 1977, Pelé closed out his career in an exhibition match between the Cosmos and Santos. The match was played in front of a sold-out crowd at Giants Stadium and was televised in the US on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; as well as throughout the world. Pelé&#x27;s father and wife both attended the match, as well as Muhammad Ali and Bobby Moore. Delivering a message to the audience before the start of the game – &quot;Love is more important than what we can take in life&quot; – Pelé played the first half with the Cosmos, the second with Santos. The game ended with the Cosmos winning 2–1, with Pelé scoring with a 30-yard free-kick for the Cosmos in what was the final goal of his career. During the second half, it started to rain, prompting a Brazilian newspaper to come out with the headline the following day: &quot;Even The Sky Was Crying.&quot;

== International career ==

Pelé&#x27;s first international match was a 2–1 defeat against Argentina on 7 July 1957 at the Maracanã. In that match, he scored his first goal for Brazil aged 16 years and eight months, and he remains the youngest goalscorer for his country.

=== 1958 World Cup ===

Pelé arrived in Sweden sidelined by a knee injury but on his return from the treatment room, his colleagues stood together and insisted upon his selection. His first match was against the USSR in the third match of the first round of the 1958 FIFA World Cup, where he gave the assist to Vavá&#x27;s second goal. He was at the time the youngest player ever to participate in the World Cup. He scored his first World Cup goal against Wales in the quarter-finals, the only goal of the match, to help Brazil advance to the semi-finals while becoming the youngest ever World Cup goalscorer at 17 years and 239 days. Against France in the semi-final, Brazil was leading 2–1 at halftime, and then Pelé scored a hat-trick, becoming the youngest player in World Cup history to do so.

On 29 June 1958, Pelé became the youngest player to play in a World Cup final match at 17 years and 249 days. He scored two goals in that final as Brazil beat Sweden 5–2 in Stockholm, the capital. Pelé hit the post and then Vavá scored two goals to give Brazil the lead. Pelé&#x27;s first goal, where he flicked the ball over a defender before volleying into the corner of the net, was selected as one of the best goals in the history of the World Cup. Following Pelé&#x27;s second goal, Swedish player Sigvard Parling would later comment, &quot;When Pelé scored the fifth goal in that Final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding&quot;. When the match ended, Pelé passed out on the field, and was revived by Garrincha. He then recovered, and was compelled by the victory to weep as he was being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker Just Fontaine, and was named best young player of the tournament. His impact was arguably greater off the field, with Barney Ronay writing, &quot;With nothing but talent to guide him, the boy from Minas Gerais became the first black global sporting superstar, and a source of genuine uplift and inspiration.&quot;

It was in the 1958 World Cup that Pelé began wearing a jersey with the number 10, which was the result of disorganization: the leaders of the Brazilian Federation did not allocate the shirt numbers of players and it was up to FIFA to choose the number 10 shirt for Pelé, who was a substitute on the occasion. The press proclaimed Pelé the greatest revelation of the 1958 World Cup, and he was also retroactively given the Silver Ball as the second best player of the tournament, behind Didi.

=== 1959 South American Championship ===

Pelé also played in the South American Championship. In the 1959 competition he was named best player of the tournament and was the top scorer with eight goals, as Brazil came second despite being unbeaten in the tournament. He scored in five of Brazil&#x27;s six games, including two goals against Chile and a hat-trick against Paraguay.

=== 1962 World Cup ===

When the 1962 World Cup started, Pelé was considered the best player in the world. In the first match of the 1962 World Cup in Chile, against Mexico, Pelé assisted the first goal and then scored the second one, after a run past four defenders, to go up 2–0. He got injured in the next game while attempting a long-range shot against Czechoslovakia. This would keep him out of the rest of the tournament, and forced coach Aymoré Moreira to make his only lineup change of the tournament. The substitute was Amarildo, who performed well for the rest of the tournament. However, it was Garrincha who would take the leading role and carry Brazil to their second World Cup title, after beating Czechoslovakia at the final in Santiago. At the time, only players who appeared in the final were eligible for a medal before FIFA regulations were changed in 1978 to include the entire squad, with Pelé receiving his winner&#x27;s medal retroactively in 2007.

=== 1966 World Cup ===

Pelé was the most famous footballer in the world during the 1966 World Cup in England, and Brazil fielded some world champions like Garrincha, Gilmar and Djalma Santos with the addition of other stars like Jairzinho, Tostão and Gérson, leading to high expectations for them. Brazil was eliminated in the first round, playing only three matches. The World Cup was marked, among other things, for brutal fouls on Pelé that left him injured by the Bulgarian and Portuguese defenders.

Pelé scored the first goal from a free kick against Bulgaria, becoming the first player to score in three successive FIFA World Cups, but due to his injury, a result of persistent fouling by the Bulgarians, he missed the second game against Hungary. His coach stated that after the first game he felt &quot;every team will take care of him in the same manner&quot;. Brazil lost that game and Pelé, although still recovering, was brought back for the last crucial match against Portugal at Goodison Park in Liverpool by the Brazilian coach Vicente Feola. Feola changed the entire defense, including the goalkeeper, while in midfield he returned to the formation of the first match. During the game, Portugal defender João Morais fouled Pelé, but was not sent off by referee George McCabe; a decision retrospectively viewed as being among the worst refereeing errors in World Cup history. Pelé had to stay on the field limping for the rest of the game since substitutes were not allowed in football at that time. Brazil lost the match against the Portuguese led by Eusébio and were eliminated from the tournament as a result. After this game he vowed he would never again play in the World Cup, a decision he would later change.

=== 1970 World Cup ===

Pelé was called to the national team in early 1969, he refused at first, but then accepted and played in six World Cup qualifying matches, scoring six goals. The 1970 World Cup in Mexico was expected to be Pelé&#x27;s last. Brazil&#x27;s squad for the tournament featured major changes to the 1966 squad. Players like Garrincha, Nilton Santos, Valdir Pereira, Djalma Santos, and Gilmar had already retired. However, Brazil&#x27;s 1970 World Cup squad, which included players like Pelé, Rivellino, Jairzinho, Gérson, Carlos Alberto Torres, Tostão and Clodoaldo, is often considered to be the greatest football team in history.

The front five of Jairzinho, Pelé, Gerson, Tostão, and Rivellino together created an attacking momentum, with Pelé having a central role in Brazil&#x27;s way to the final. All of Brazil&#x27;s matches in the tournament (except the final) were played in Guadalajara, and in the first match against Czechoslovakia, Pelé gave Brazil a 2–1 lead, by controlling Gerson&#x27;s 50-yard pass with his chest and then scoring. In this match Pelé attempted to lob goalkeeper Ivo Viktor from the halfway line, only narrowly missing the Czechoslovak goal. Brazil went on to win the match, 4–1. In the first half of the match against England, Pelé nearly scored with a header that was saved by the England goalkeeper Gordon Banks. Pelé recalled he was already shouting &quot;Goal&quot; when he headed the ball. It was often referred to as the &quot;save of the century&quot;. In the second half, he controlled a cross from Tostão before flicking the ball to Jairzinho who scored the only goal.
Against Romania, Pelé scored two goals, which included a 20-yard bending free-kick, with Brazil winning 3–2. In the quarter-final against Peru, Brazil won 4–2, with Pelé assisting Tostão for Brazil&#x27;s third goal. In the semi-final, Brazil faced Uruguay for the first time since the 1950 World Cup final round match. Jairzinho put Brazil ahead 2–1, and Pelé assisted Rivellino for the 3–1. During that match, Pelé made one of his most famous plays. Tostão passed the ball for Pelé to collect which Uruguay&#x27;s goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz took notice of and ran off his line to get the ball before Pelé. However, Pelé got there first and fooled Mazurkiewicz with a feint by not touching the ball, causing it to roll to the goalkeeper&#x27;s left, while Pelé went to the goalkeeper&#x27;s right. Pelé ran around the goalkeeper to retrieve the ball and took a shot while turning towards the goal, but he turned in excess as he shot, and the ball drifted just wide of the far post.

Brazil played Italy in the final at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City. Pelé scored the opening goal with a header after out jumping Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich. Brazil&#x27;s 100th World Cup goal, Pelé&#x27;s leap of joy into the arms of teammate Jairzinho in celebrating the goal is regarded as one of the most iconic moments in World Cup history. He then made assists for Brazil&#x27;s third goal, scored by Jairzinho, and the fourth finished by Carlos Alberto. The last goal of the game is often considered the greatest team goal of all time because it involved all but two of the team&#x27;s outfield players. The play culminated after Pelé made a blind pass that went into Carlos Alberto&#x27;s running trajectory. He came running from behind and struck the ball to score. Brazil won the match 4–1, keeping the Jules Rimet Trophy indefinitely, and Pelé received the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament. Burgnich, who marked Pelé during the final, was quoted saying, &quot;I told myself before the game, &quot;he&#x27;s made of skin and bones just like everyone else&quot; – but I was wrong&quot;. In terms of his goals and assists throughout the 1970 World Cup, Pelé was directly responsible for 53% of Brazil&#x27;s goals throughout the tournament.

Pelé&#x27;s last international match was on 18 July 1971 against Yugoslavia in Rio de Janeiro. With Pelé on the field, the Brazilian team&#x27;s record was 67 wins, 14 draws, and 11 losses. Brazil never lost a match while fielding both Pelé and Garrincha. Pelé&#x27;s 77 goals (in 92 games) for Brazil saw him hold the record as the national team&#x27;s top goalscorer for over fifty years until it was surpassed by Neymar (in his 125th game) in September 2023.

On 19 December 1973, Pelé played for a Brazil XI side against the Rest of The World in a farewell game for Garrincha, scoring the equalizer in an eventual 2–1 win. On 21 July 1983, the 42-year-old Pelé played for another Brazil XI side against a South Brazil team in Goiânia in a friendly match organized by Zico to benefit the victims of a flood in Santa Catarina; he scored a free-kick in a 1–2 loss.

== Style of play ==

Pelé was known for connecting the phrase &quot;The Beautiful Game&quot; with football. A prolific goalscorer, he was known for his ability to anticipate his opponents’ movements and finish off chances with an accurate and powerful shot with either foot. Pelé was also a hard-working and complete player with exceptional vision and intelligence, who was recognised for his precise passing and the ability to provide teammates with assists.

In his early career, he played in a variety of attacking positions. Although he often operated inside the penalty area as a striker or centre forward, his wide range of skills allowed him to play as an inside forward or a second striker. In his later career, he took on a playmaking role behind the strikers, often functioning as an attacking midfielder. Pelé&#x27;s unique playing style combined speed, creativity, and technical skill with physical power, stamina, and athleticism. His technique, flair, agility, and dribbling skills allowed him to beat opponents with the ball, and frequently saw him use sudden changes of direction and elaborate feints to get past players, such as his trademark move, the &quot;drible da vaca&quot;. Another one of his signature moves was the &quot;paradinha&quot;, or little stop.

Pelé excelled in the air, due to his heading accuracy, timing, and elevation. Renowned for his bending shots, he was also an accurate free-kick taker and penalty taker, although he often refrained from taking penalties, stating that he believed it to be a cowardly way to score.

Pelé was also known to be a fair and highly influential player, who stood out for his charismatic leadership and sportsmanship on the pitch. His warm embrace of Bobby Moore following the Brazil vs England game at the 1970 World Cup is viewed as the embodiment of sportsmanship, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; stating the image &quot;captured the respect that two great players had for each other. As they exchanged jerseys, touches, and looks, the sportsmanship between them was all in the image. No gloating and no fist-pumping from Pelé. No despair, no defeatism from Bobby Moore.&quot; Pelé also earned a reputation for being a “big game player” due to his tendency to score crucial goals in important matches.

== Legacy ==
Named the “greatest&quot; by FIFA in 2012, Pelé is one of the most lauded players in the history of football and has been frequently ranked the best player ever. Following his emergence at the 1958 World Cup he was nicknamed &quot;O Rei&quot; (&quot;The King&quot;). Among his contemporaries, Dutch star Johan Cruyff stated, &quot;Pelé was the only footballer who surpassed the boundaries of logic.&quot; Brazil&#x27;s 1970 World Cup-winning captain Carlos Alberto Torres opined: &quot;His great secret was improvisation. Those things he did were in one moment. He had an extraordinary perception of the game.&quot; According to Tostão, his strike partner at the 1970 World Cup: &quot;Pelé was the greatest – he was simply flawless. And off the pitch he is always smiling and upbeat. You never see him bad-tempered. He loves being Pelé.&quot; His Brazilian teammate Clodoaldo commented on the adulation he witnessed: &quot;In some countries they wanted to touch him, in some they wanted to kiss him. In others they even kissed the ground he walked on. I thought it was beautiful, just beautiful.&quot; According to Franz Beckenbauer, West Germany&#x27;s 1974 World Cup-winning captain: &quot;Pelé is the greatest player of all time. He reigned supreme for 20 years. There&#x27;s no one to compare with him.&quot;
Former Real Madrid and Hungary star Ferenc Puskás stated: &quot;The greatest player in history was Di Stéfano. I refuse to classify Pelé as a player. He was above that.&quot; Just Fontaine, French striker and the leading scorer at the 1958 World Cup said &quot;When I saw Pelé play, it made me feel I should hang up my boots.&quot; England&#x27;s 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore commented: &quot;Pelé was the most complete player I&#x27;ve ever seen, he had everything. Two good feet. Magic in the air. Quick. Powerful. Could beat people with skill. Could outrun people. Only five feet and eight inches tall, yet he seemed a giant of an athlete on the pitch. Perfect balance and impossible vision. He was the greatest because he could do anything and everything on a football pitch. I remember João Saldanha the coach being asked by a Brazilian journalist who was the best goalkeeper in his squad. He said Pelé. The man could play in any position&quot;. Former Manchester United striker and member of England&#x27;s 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning team Sir Bobby Charlton stated, &quot;I sometimes feel as though football was invented for this magical player.&quot; During the 1970 World Cup, when Manchester United defender Paddy Crerand (who was part of the ITV panel) was asked, &quot;How do you spell Pelé?&quot;, he replied, &quot;Easy: G-O-D.&quot; Following Pelé&#x27;s death, former Brazilian international and World Cup Winner Ronaldo stated that his &quot;legacy transcends generations&quot;. Ronaldo&#x27;s teammate for club and country, Roberto Carlos, also expressed gratitude towards Pele, saying that the &quot;football world thanks you for everything you did for us&quot;. Many of such tributes were issued after Pelé&#x27;s death at the age of 82.

=== Accolades ===

After retiring, Pelé continued to be lauded by players, coaches, journalists and others. Brazilian attacking midfielder Zico, who represented Brazil at the 1978, 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cup, stated: &quot;This debate about the player of the century is absurd. There&#x27;s only one possible answer: Pelé. He&#x27;s the greatest player of all time, and by some distance I might add&quot;. French three-time Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Michel Platini said: &quot;There&#x27;s Pelé the man, and then Pelé the player. And to play like Pelé is to play like God.&quot; Diego Maradona, joint FIFA Player of the Century, and the player Pelé is historically compared with, stated, &quot;It&#x27;s too bad we never got along, but he was an awesome player&quot;. Prolific Brazilian striker Romário, winner of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and player of the tournament, remarked: &quot;It&#x27;s only inevitable I look up to Pelé. He&#x27;s like a God to us&quot;. Five-time FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo said, &quot;Pelé is the greatest player in football history, and there will only be one Pelé&quot;, while José Mourinho, two-time UEFA Champions League winning manager, commented: &quot;I think he is football. You have the real special one – Mr. Pelé.&quot; Real Madrid honorary president and former player, Alfredo Di Stéfano, opined: &quot;The best player ever? Pelé. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are both great players with specific qualities, but Pelé was better&quot;.

Presenting Pelé with the Laureus Lifetime Achievement Award, former South African president Nelson Mandela said, &quot;To watch him play was to watch the delight of a child combined with the extraordinary grace of a man in full.&quot; US politician and political scientist Henry Kissinger stated: &quot;Performance at a high level in any sport is to exceed the ordinary human scale. But Pelé&#x27;s performance transcended that of the ordinary star by as much as the star exceeds ordinary performance.&quot; After a reporter asked if his fame compared to that of Jesus, Pelé joked, &quot;There are parts of the world where Jesus Christ is not so well known.&quot; The artist Andy Warhol (who painted a portrait of Pelé) also quipped, &quot;Pelé was one of the few who contradicted my theory: instead of 15 minutes of fame, he will have 15 centuries.&quot; David Goldblatt wrote that his emergence at the World Cup in 1958 coincided with &quot;the explosive spread of television, which massively amplified his presence everywhere&quot;, while Barney Ronay states, &quot;What is certain is that Pelé invented this game, the idea of individual global sporting superstardom, and in a way that is unrepeatable now.&quot;

In 1999, the International Olympic Committee elected him the Athlete of the Century and &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Pelé one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century. In 2000, the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics (IFFHS) voted Pelé the World Player of the Century. During his playing days, Pelé was for a period the highest-paid athlete in the world. Pelé&#x27;s &quot;electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals&quot; made him a star around the world. To take full advantage of his popularity, his teams toured internationally. During his career, he became known as &quot;The Black Pearl&quot; (&quot;A Pérola Negra&quot;), &quot;The King of Football&quot; (&quot;O Rei do Futebol&quot;), &quot;The King Pelé&quot; (&quot;O Rei Pelé&quot;) or simply &quot;The King&quot; (O Rei). In 2014, the city of Santos inaugurated the Pelé museum – Museu Pelé – which displays a 2,400 piece collection of Pelé memorabilia. Approximately $22 million was invested in the construction of the museum, housed in a 19th-century mansion.

In January 2014, Pelé was awarded the first ever FIFA Ballon d&#x27;Or Prix d&#x27;Honneur as an acknowledgment from the world governing body of the sport for his contribution to world football. After changing the rules in 1995, &quot;France Football&quot; did an extensive analysis in 2015 of the players who would have won the award if it had been open for them beginning in 1956: the year the Ballon d&#x27;Or award started. Their study revealed that Pelé would have received the award a record seven times (&quot;Ballon d&#x27;or: Le nouveau palmarès&quot;). The original recipients, however, remain unchanged. In 2020, Pelé was named in the Ballon d&#x27;Or Dream Team, a greatest all-time XI.

According to the RSSSF, Pelé was one of the most successful goal-scorers in the world, scoring 538 league goals, a total of 775 in 840 official games and a tally of 1,301 goals in 1,390 appearances during his professional senior career, which included friendlies and tour games. He is ranked among the leading scorers in football history in both official and total matches. After his retirement in 1977 he played eight exhibition games and scored three goals.

=== &quot;Pelé Pact&quot; and Puma sponsorship ===
In the lead up to the 1970 World Cup, Adidas and Puma established the &quot;Pelé Pact&quot;, where both German sportswear companies, owned by the rival Dassler brothers, agreed not to sign a deal with Pelé, feeling that a bidding war would become too expensive. However, Puma would break the pact by signing Pelé, and in addition to paying him a percentage of Puma King boot sales, gave him $120,000 ($2.85 million in 2022) to tie his laces prior to Brazil&#x27;s quarter-final against Peru to advertise their boots. With the camera panning in on the most famous athlete in the world, the Puma King Pelé boots were broadcast to a global audience, generating enormous publicity for the brand. Praised as a shrewd marketing move by Puma, the Pelé deal played a prominent role in the Dassler brothers feud, with many business experts crediting the rivalry and competition for transforming sports apparel into a multi-billion pound industry.

==Personal life==
=== Relationships and children ===

Pelé married three times and had several affairs, fathering seven children in all.

In 1966, Pelé married Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi. They had two daughters, Kely Cristina (born 13 January 1967), who married Arthur DeLuca, and Jennifer (b. 1978), as well as one son, Edson (&quot;Edinho&quot;, b. 27 August 1970). The couple divorced in 1982. In May 2014, Edinho was sentenced to 33 years in jail for laundering money from drug trafficking. On appeal, the sentence was reduced to 12 years and 10 months.

From 1981 to 1986, Pelé was romantically linked with TV presenter Xuxa. She was 17 when they started dating. In April 1994, Pelé married psychologist and gospel singer Assíria Lemos Seixas, who gave birth on 28 September 1996 to twins Joshua and Celeste through fertility treatments. The couple divorced in 2008.

Pelé had at least two more children from affairs. Sandra Machado, who was born from an affair Pelé had in 1964 with a housemaid, Anizia Machado, fought for years to be acknowledged by Pelé, who refused to submit to DNA tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;PELE/SANDRA/ESPN&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Pelé finally relented after a court-ordered DNA test proved she was his daughter. Sandra Machado died of cancer in 2006.

At the age of 73, Pelé announced his intention to marry 41-year-old Marcia Aoki, a Japanese-Brazilian importer of medical equipment from Penápolis, São Paulo, whom he had been dating since 2010. They first met in the mid-1980s in New York, before meeting again in 2008. They married in July 2016.

=== Politics ===

In January 1995, he was appointed by Fernando Cardoso as minister of sports. During his tenure, multiple reforms against corruption in state football associations were presented. He resigned from the post on 30 April 1998.

During the 2013 protests in Brazil, Pelé asked for people to put aside the demonstrations and support the Brazil national team.

On 1 June 2022, Pelé published an open letter to the President of Russia Vladimir Putin on his Instagram account, in which he made a public plea to stop the &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;unjustified&quot; Russian invasion of Ukraine.

=== Religion ===

A Catholic, Pelé donated a signed jersey to Pope Francis. Accompanied by a signed football from Ronaldo Nazario, it is located in one of the Vatican Museums.

=== Health ===

In 1977, Brazilian media reported that Pelé had his right kidney removed. In November 2012, Pelé underwent a successful hip operation. In December 2017, Pelé appeared in a wheelchair at the 2018 World Cup draw in Moscow where he was pictured with President Vladimir Putin and Argentine footballer Diego Maradona. A month later, he collapsed from exhaustion and was taken to hospital. In 2019, after a hospitalisation because of a urinary tract infection, Pelé underwent surgery to remove kidney stones. In February 2020, his son Edinho reported that Pelé was unable to walk independently and reluctant to leave home, ascribing his condition to a lack of rehabilitation following his hip operation.

In September 2021, Pelé had surgery to remove a tumour on the right side of his colon. Although his eldest daughter Kely stated he was &quot;doing well&quot;, he was reportedly readmitted to intensive care a few days later, before finally being released on 30 September 2021 to begin chemotherapy. In November 2022, ESPN Brasil reported that Pelé had been taken to hospital with &quot;general swelling&quot;, along with cardiac issues and concerns that his chemotherapy treatment was not having the expected effect; his daughter Kely stated there was &quot;no emergency&quot;.

== After football ==


In 1994, Pelé was appointed a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador. In 1995, Brazilian president Fernando Henrique Cardoso appointed Pelé to the position of extraordinary minister for sport. During this time he proposed legislation to reduce corruption in Brazilian football, which became known as the &quot;Pelé law&quot;. Cardoso eliminated the post of sports minister in 1998. In 2001, Pelé was accused of involvement in a corruption scandal that stole $700,000 from UNICEF. It was claimed that money given to Pelé&#x27;s company for a benefit match was not returned after it was cancelled, although nothing was proven, and it was denied by UNICEF. In 1997, he received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II at a ceremony in Buckingham Palace. Pelé also helped inaugurate the 2006 FIFA World Cup, alongside supermodel Claudia Schiffer.

In 1993, Pelé publicly accused the Brazilian football administrator Ricardo Teixeira of corruption after Pelé&#x27;s television company was rejected in a contest for the Brazilian domestic rights to the 1994 World Cup. Pelé&#x27;s accusations led to an eight-year feud between the pair. As a consequence of the affair, the President of FIFA, João Havelange, Teixeira&#x27;s father-in-law, banned Pelé from the draw for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in Las Vegas. Criticisms over the ban were perceived to have damaged Havelange&#x27;s chances of re-election as FIFA&#x27;s president in 1994.

In 1976, Pelé was on a Pepsi-sponsored trip in Lagos, Nigeria, when the military attempted a coup. Pelé was trapped in a hotel together with Arthur Ashe and other tennis pros, who were participating in the interrupted 1976 Lagos WCT tournament. Pelé and his crew eventually left the hotel to stay at the residence of Brazil&#x27;s ambassador as they could not leave the country for a couple of days. Later the airport was opened and Pelé left the country disguised as a pilot.

Pelé published several autobiographies, starred in documentary films, and composed musical pieces, including Sérgio Mendes&#x27; soundtrack for the film &quot;Pelé&quot; directed by François Reichenbach in 1977. He appeared in the 1981 film &quot;Escape to Victory&quot;, about a World War II-era football match between Allied prisoners of war and a German team. Pelé starred alongside other footballers of the 1960s and 1970s, with actors Michael Caine and Sylvester Stallone. In 1969, Pelé starred in a telenovela called &quot;Os Estranhos&quot;, about first contact with aliens. It was created to drum up interest in the Apollo missions. In 2001, he had a cameo role in the football satire film &quot;Mike Bassett: England Manager&quot;. Pelé was asked to participate in the 2006 ESPN documentary film &quot;Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos&quot;, but declined when the producers refused to pay his requested $100,000 fee.

Pelé appeared at the 2006 World Economic Forum in Davos, and spoke on the subject titled, &quot;Can a Ball Change the World: The Role of Sports in Development&quot;. In November 2007, Pelé was in Sheffield, England, to mark the 150th anniversary of the world&#x27;s oldest football club, Sheffield F.C. Pelé was the guest of honour at Sheffield&#x27;s anniversary match against Inter Milan at Bramall Lane. As part of his visit, Pelé opened an exhibition which included the first public showing in 40 years of the original hand-written rules of football. Pelé scouted for Premier League club Fulham in 2002. He made the draw for the qualification groups for the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals. On 1 August 2010, Pelé was introduced as the honorary president of a revived New York Cosmos, aiming to field a team in Major League Soccer. In August 2011, ESPN reported that Santos was considering bringing him out of retirement for a cameo role in the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup, although this turned out to be false.

The most notable area of Pelé&#x27;s life since football was his ambassadorial work. In 1992, he was appointed a UN ambassador for ecology and the environment. He was also awarded Brazil&#x27;s gold medal for outstanding services to the sport in 1995. In 2012, Pelé was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Edinburgh for &quot;significant contribution to humanitarian and environmental causes, as well as his sporting achievements&quot;.

In 2009, Pelé assisted the Rio de Janeiro bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics. In July 2009, he spearheaded the Rio 2016 presentation to the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa General Assembly in Abuja, Nigeria.

On 12 August 2012, Pelé was an attendee at the 2012 Olympic hunger summit hosted by British prime minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street, London, part of a series of international efforts which have sought to respond to the return of hunger as a high-profile global issue. Later on the same day, Pelé appeared at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, following the handover section to the next host city for the 2016 Summer Olympics, Rio de Janeiro.

In March 2016, Pelé filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking US$30 million in damages claiming violations under the Lanham Act for false endorsement and a state law claim for violation of his right of publicity. The suit alleged that at one point, Samsung and Pelé came close to entering into a licensing agreement for Pelé to appear in a Samsung advertising campaign, but Samsung abruptly pulled out of the negotiations. The October 2015 Samsung ad in question included a partial face shot of a man who allegedly &quot;very closely resembles&quot; Pelé and also a superimposed high-definition television screen next to the image of the man featuring a &quot;modified bicycle or scissors-kick&quot;, often used by Pelé. The case was settled out-of-court several years later.

In addition to his ambassadorial work, Pelé supported various charitable causes, such as Action for Brazil&#x27;s Children, Gols Pela Vida, SOS Children&#x27;s Villages, The Littlest Lamb, Prince&#x27;s Rainforests Project and many more. In 2016, Pelé auctioned more than 1600 items from a collection he accumulated over decades and raised £3.6 million for charity. In 2018, Pelé founded his charitable organisation, the Pelé Foundation, which endeavours to empower impoverished and disenfranchised children from around the globe.

== Death and funeral ==

In 2021, Pelé was diagnosed with colon cancer. He underwent surgery the same month, and afterwards was treated with several rounds of chemotherapy. In early 2022, metastasis were detected in the intestine, lung and liver. On 29 November, he was admitted to the Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital in São Paulo due to a respiratory infection after he contracted COVID-19 and for reassessment of the treatment of his colon cancer. On 3 December 2022, it was reported that Pelé had become unresponsive to chemotherapy and that it was replaced with palliative care.

On 21 December 2022, the Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital, where Pelé was being treated, stated that his tumour had advanced and he required &quot;greater care related to renal and cardiac dysfunctions&quot;. Therefore, he was not allowed to spend Christmas at home, as his family had wanted. Pelé died on 29 December 2022, at 3:27 pm, at the age of 82, due to multiple organ failure, a complication of colon cancer. Pelé&#x27;s death certificate stated that he had died of kidney failure, heart failure, bronchopneumonia and colon adenocarcinoma. His 100-year-old mother, Celeste, survived him, though she had been in a vegetative state since 2019, and was thus unaware of his death; she would later die in June 2024. Pelé&#x27;s sister Maria Lucia do Nascimento described their mother as &quot;in her own little world&quot;.

Tributes were paid by current players, including Neymar, Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi, along with other major sporting figures, celebrities, and world leaders. The outgoing Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, declared a three-day period of national mourning. The national flags of the 211 member associations of FIFA were flown at half-mast at FIFA headquarters in Zürich. Landmarks and stadiums lit up in honour of Pelé included the Christ the Redeemer statue and Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, the headquarters of CONMEBOL in Paraguay and Wembley Stadium in London. There was applause and a minute&#x27;s silence at matches in honour of Pelé.

Pelé&#x27;s funeral, which involved his body being publicly displayed in an open coffin which was draped with the flags of Brazil and Santos FC, began at Vila Belmiro stadium in Santos on 2 January 2023. Thousands of fans flooded the streets to attend the first day of the funeral service, with some in attendance claiming that they had to wait three hours in line. The public wake would continue to 3 January, and saw more than 230,000 people in attendance. Many in attendance were wearing the yellow and green No. 10 Brazilian jerseys and the black and white Santos football club jersey, which Pelé wore during his career. Brazil television channels suspended normal broadcasting to cover the funeral procession. Pelé&#x27;s wife Marcia Aoki, his son Edinho, FIFA president Gianni Infantino, CONMEBOL president Alejandro Domínguez and president of the Brazilian Football Confederation Ednaldo Rodrigues were among those in attendance. It would continue on 3 January 2023. Newly sworn in Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva was also among those who attended the wake. After the funeral procession, Pelé was buried at the Memorial Necrópole Ecumênica.

Kigali Pelé Stadium in Rwanda was renamed for him in March 2023 by Rwandan president Paul Kagame and FIFA president Gianni Infantino as part of the 73rd FIFA Congress. On 26 April 2023, the nickname became synonymous with &quot;exceptional, incomparable, unique&quot; in &quot;Michaelis&quot; Portuguese-language dictionary after a campaign with 125,000 signatories.

== Career statistics ==

Pelé&#x27;s goalscoring record is often reported by FIFA as being 1,281 goals in 1,363 games. This figure includes goals scored by Pelé in friendly club matches, including international tours Pelé completed with Santos and the New York Cosmos, and a few games Pelé played in for the Brazilian armed forces teams during his national service in Brazil and the state team of São Paulo who competed for the Brazilian Championship of States Teams (&quot;Campeonato Brasileiro de Seleções Estaduais&quot;). He was listed in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; for most career goals scored in football. In 2000, IFFHS declared Pelé as the &quot;World&#x27;s Best and successful Top Division Goal Scorer of all time&quot; with 541 goals in 560 games and honoured him with a trophy.

Individual

In December 2000, Pelé and Maradona shared the prize of FIFA Player of the Century by FIFA. The award was originally intended to be based upon votes in a web poll, but after it became apparent that it favoured Diego Maradona after a reported cyber-blitz by Maradona fans, FIFA then appointed a &quot;Family of Football&quot; committee of FIFA members to decide the winner of the award together with the votes of the readers of the FIFA magazine. The committee chose Pelé. Since Maradona was winning the Internet poll, however, it was decided he and Pelé should share the award.

<text>Polycarp (; , &quot;Polýkarpos&quot;; ; AD 69 155) was a Christian bishop of Smyrna. According to the &quot;Martyrdom of Polycarp&quot;, he died a martyr, bound and burned at the stake, then stabbed when the fire failed to consume his body. Polycarp is regarded as a saint and Church Father in the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, Oriental Orthodox Churches, Lutheranism, and Anglicanism.

Both Irenaeus and Tertullian say that Polycarp had been a disciple of John the Apostle, one of Jesus&#x27;s disciples. In &quot;On Illustrious Men&quot;, Jerome similarly writes that Polycarp was a disciple of John the Apostle, who had ordained him as a bishop of Smyrna. Polycarp is regarded as one of three chief Apostolic Fathers, along with Clement of Rome and Ignatius of Antioch.

==Surviving writings and early accounts==
The sole surviving work attributed to him is the &quot;Epistle of Polycarp to the Philippians&quot;, a mosaic of references to the Greek Scriptures, which, along with an account of &quot;Martyrdom of Polycarp&quot;, forms part of the collection of writings called &quot;Apostolic Fathers&quot;. After the Acts of the Apostles, which describes the death of Stephen, the &quot;Martyrdom&quot; is considered one of the earliest genuine accounts of a Christian martyrdom. Charles E. Hill argues extensively that the teachings Irenaeus ascribes to a certain apostolic &quot;presbyter&quot; throughout his writings represent lost teachings of Polycarp, his teacher.

Some scholars attribute the pastoral epistles the biblical books 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, and the Epistle to Titus to Polycarp. Since the text of those books includes attribution to Paul, this theory regarding Polycarp&#x27;s authorship places the books in the category of pseudepigrapha. Hans von Campenhausen is one scholar who holds the view that Polycarp is the real author.

==Life==
The chief sources of information concerning the life of Polycarp are &quot;The Martyrdom of Polycarp&quot;, &quot;Adversus Haereses&quot;, &quot;The Epistle to Florinus&quot;, the epistles of Ignatius, and Polycarp&#x27;s own letter to the Philippians. In 1999, the Harris Fragments, a collection of 3rd- to 6th-century Coptic texts that mention Polycarp, were published.

===Link to the Apostles and Jesus===
According to Irenaeus, Polycarp was a companion of Papias, another &quot;hearer of John&quot;, and a correspondent of Ignatius of Antioch. Ignatius addressed a letter to him and mentions him in his letters to the Ephesians and to the Magnesians. Polycarp&#x27;s epistle to the Philippians gives us some insights to the early usage of the New Testament from the quotes used within his letter. Irenaeus regarded the memory of Polycarp as a link to the apostolic past. In his letter to Florinus, a fellow student of Polycarp who had become a Roman presbyter and later lapsed into heresy, Irenaeus relates how and when he became a Christian:I could tell you the place where the blessed Polycarp sat to preach the Word of God. It is yet present to my mind with what gravity he everywhere came in and went out; what was the sanctity of his deportment, the majesty of his countenance; and what were his holy exhortations to the people. I seem to hear him now relate how he conversed with John and many others who had seen Jesus Christ, the words he had heard from their mouths.
In particular, he heard the account of Polycarp&#x27;s discussion with John and with others who had seen Jesus. Irenaeus reports that Polycarp was converted to Christianity by apostles, was consecrated a presbyter, and communicated with many who had seen Jesus. He writes that he had had the good fortune, when young, to know Polycarp, who was then far advanced in years.

===Visit to Anicetus===
According to Irenaeus, during the time his fellow Syrian Anicetus was Bishop of Rome, Polycarp visited Rome to discuss differences in the practices of the churches of Asia and Rome. Irenaeus states that on certain things the two speedily came to an understanding, while as to the observance of the New Covenant Passover, each adhered to his own custom, without breaking off full communion with the other. Polycarp followed the Eastern practice of celebrating the feast on the 14th of Nisan, the day of the Jewish Passover, regardless of the day of the week on which it fell, while Anicetus followed the Western practice of celebrating the feast on the first Sunday following the first full moon after the spring equinox. Anicetus allowed Polycarp to celebrate the Eucharist in his own church, which was regarded by the Romans as a great honor.

===Martyrdom===

In the &quot;Martyrdom&quot;, Polycarp is recorded as saying on the day of his death: &quot;Eighty and six years I have served Him, and He has done me no wrong.&quot; This could indicate either that he was then eighty-six years old or that he had lived eighty-six years after his conversion. Polycarp goes on to say: &quot;How then can I blaspheme my King and Savior? You threaten me with a fire that burns for a season, and after a little while is quenched; but you are ignorant of the fire of everlasting punishment that is prepared for the wicked.&quot; Polycarp was burned at the stake and pierced with a spear for refusing to burn incense to the Roman emperor. On his farewell, he said: &quot;I bless you, Father, for judging me worthy of this hour, so that in the company of the martyrs I may share the cup of Christ.&quot;

The date of Polycarp&#x27;s death is in dispute. Eusebius dates it to the reign of Marcus Aurelius, c. 166–167. However, a post-Eusebian addition to the &quot;Martyrdom of Polycarp&quot;, dates his death to Saturday, 23 February, in the proconsulship of Lucius Statius Quadratus, c. 155 or 156. These earlier dates better fit the tradition of his association with Ignatius and John the Evangelist.

The &quot;Martyrdom of Polycarp&quot; states that Polycarp was taken on the Sabbath and killed on &quot;the Great Sabbath&quot;. English patristic scholar William Cave (1637–1713) believed that this was evidence that the Smyrnaeans under Polycarp observed the seventh-day Sabbath, i.e. assembled on Saturdays. J. B. Lightfoot records as a common interpretation of the expression &quot;the Great Sabbath&quot; to refer to Pesach or another Jewish festival. This is contradicted by the standard Jewish calendar, under which Nisan 14, the date of the Pesach, can fall no earlier than late March and hence at least a month after the traditional date of Polycarp&#x27;s death 23 February. Hence, Lightfoot understood the expression in reference to the Purim festival, celebrated a month before Pesach, while other scholars suggest that at the time the Jewish calendar had not yet been standardized, and that this day, both Jews and Christians celebrated Pesach and a (Quartodeciman) Christian Passover, respectively.

==Importance==

Polycarp occupies an important place in the history of the early Christian Church, was called &quot;the most admirable Polycarp one of these [elect], in whose times among us he showed himself an apostolic and prophetic teacher and bishop of the Catholic Church in Smyrna&quot; by his contemporaries. He is among the earliest Christians whose writings survived. Jerome wrote that Polycarp was a &quot;disciple of the apostle John and by him ordained presbyter of Smyrna&quot;. He was an elder of an important congregation that was a large contributor to the founding of the Christian Church. He is from an era whose orthodoxy is accepted alongside Catholics by the ancient Eastern Orthodox Churches and Oriental Orthodox Churches, and widely also by mainstream Protestants, Church of God groups, Sabbatarians.

According to Eusebius, Polycrates of Ephesus cited the example of Polycarp in defense of local practices during the quartodeciman controversy.

Irenaeus, who as a young man had heard Polycarp preach, described him as &quot;a man who was of much greater weight, and a more steadfast witness of truth, than Valentinus, and Marcion, and the rest of the heretics.” Polycarp lived in an age after the deaths of the apostles, when a variety of interpretations of the sayings of Jesus were being preached. His role was to authenticate orthodox teachings through his connection with the apostle John: &quot;a high value was attached to the witness Polycarp could give as to the genuine tradition of old apostolic doctrine&quot; &quot;his testimony condemning as offensive novelties the figments of the heretical teachers&quot;. Irenaeus states (iii. 3) that on Polycarp&#x27;s visit to Rome, his testimony converted many disciples of Marcion and Valentinus.

==Veneration and Commemoration==
The &quot;Martyrdom of Polycarp&quot; is one of the earliest, if not the earliest, accounts of the veneration of the relics of a saint and the annual commemoration of a saint on the date of his or her death:

And so we afterwards took up his bones which are more valuable than precious stones and finer than refined gold, and laid them in a suitable place; where the Lord will permit us to gather ourselves together, as we are able, in gladness and joy, and to celebrate the birth-day of his martyrdom for the commemoration of those that have already fought in the contest, and for the training and preparation of those that shall do so hereafter.

Relics of Polycarp are under the main altar of the church of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio della Massima. The right arm of St. Polycarp had been kept at the Monastery of the Dormition of the Theotokos-Saint Polycarp, in Ampelakiotissa near Nafpaktos, Greece, for over 500 years. It was stolen on 14 March 2013 and never recovered; however, a fragment, taken from the arm on a previous occasion, was discovered and returned to the monastery on 14 July 2019.

In the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Greek Catholic Churches, the feast day of Saint Polycarp is 23 February. In the Roman Catholic liturgical calendar, the feast day has the liturgical rank of obligatory memorial, but if the memorial is within the season of Lent that year, it is reduced in rank to a commemoration. In the Coptic Orthodox Church, his feast day is on 29 Amshir (8 March in the Gregorian calendar). Polycarp is remembered in the Church of England with a Lesser Festival on 23 February. He is also honored in the Lutheran Churches on 23 February.

== Theology ==

Polycarp&#x27;s soteriology is not clear; he does cite Ephesians 2:8 to say salvation is by grace rather than works, though later exhorts his readers to do good works. It is not clear from the text how he views works in relation to salvation as his comments are too little to make a clear conclusion. He could have believed that works are mere results of saving grace or that they are necessary to keep salvation and that they have meritorious value, thus we cannot know if he was a monergist or a synergist.

Polycarp in his letter calls Jesus the &quot;son of God&quot; and the &quot;eternal high priest&quot; and that &quot;to him all heavenly and earthly things were subjected, whom every breath worships, who comes as a judge of the living and the dead&quot;. He also highlighted the sinlessness of Jesus, defended the doctrine of the Incarnation and the death of Christ on the cross, and clearly opposed docetism. Polycarp outright denied the teachings of Marcion, claiming he was the firstborn of Satan. Polycarp&#x27;s statements in the &quot;Martyrdom of Polycarp&quot; also appear to have trinitarian theology.

What we know of Polycarp&#x27;s eschatology is largely confined to the affirmation of the resurrection of the dead and Christ&#x27;s second coming as a judge. Polycarp was perhaps a premillennialist; Polycarp&#x27;s student Irenaeus was a premillennialist along with his associate Papias, which suggests that Polycarp also held similar views.

Polycarp refers to multiple books of the New Testament as scripture, including: Matthew, Acts, 1 John, Philippians, Jude, 1 Peter, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Romans and others. Polycarp also quotes the deuterocanonical book of Tobit; however, from his manner of quotation it is not possible to know how much authority he afforded it.

Polycarp&#x27;s letter to the Philippians only mentions presbyters and deacons, which indicates the church at Philippi was led by a plurality of &quot;elder-bishops&quot;, which would imply a different ecclesiastical polity than what is found in Ignatius of Antioch&#x27;s letters. Against this, according to Steinhauser, the letter does not offer concrete evidence that the Philippian church viewed presbyters and bishops as synonyms, though still admitting that the letter still raises questions about the polity of the early church. Steinhauser hypothesized that there was possibly a temporary vacancy in the Philippian church.

Polycarp was a Quartodeciman. According to Eusebius, Polycarp claimed that he celebrated Easter on the 14th of Nisan with John the Apostle. Polycarp appears to make heresy a more serious issue than immorality. Polycarp calls immoral people to repent but called the false teachers &quot;firstborn of Satan.&quot; 

Polycarp stated, &quot;I have served him [Christ] eighty-six years and in no way has he dealt unjustly with me.&quot; Proponents of infant baptism have argued that this quote shows Polycarp being baptized as an infant, the argument being that if Polycarp was a servant of Christ for 86 years, he would have been a servant of Christ from infancy, suggesting infant baptism. However, Credobaptists such as Schoedel William have offered a different interpretation of the words of Polycarp, stating that the quote is ambiguous as regards to baptism, and that Polycarp can be understood as meaning by paraphrasing: &quot;I have always served Jesus and I am not going to cease even at the age of 86.&quot;

<doc id="24956" wikidata="Q58848" url="?curid=24956" title="Pacifism">
<text>Pacifism is the opposition to war or violence. The word &quot;pacifism&quot; was coined by the French peace campaigner Émile Arnaud and adopted by other peace activists at the tenth Universal Peace Congress in Glasgow in 1901. A related term is &quot;ahimsa&quot; (to do no harm), which is a core philosophy in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. While modern connotations are recent, having been explicated since the 19th century, ancient references abound.

In modern times, interest was revived by Leo Tolstoy in his late works, particularly in &quot;The Kingdom of God Is Within You&quot;. Mahatma Gandhi propounded the practice of steadfast nonviolent opposition which he called &quot;satyagraha&quot;, instrumental in its role in the Indian independence movement. Its effectiveness served as inspiration to Martin Luther King Jr., James Lawson, Mary and Charles Beard, James Bevel, Thích Nhất Hạnh, and many others in the civil rights movement.

==Definition==
Pacifism covers a spectrum of views, including the belief that international disputes can and should be peacefully resolved, calls for the abolition of the institutions of the military and war, opposition to any organization of society through governmental force (anarchist or libertarian pacifism), rejection of the use of physical violence to obtain political, economic or social goals, the obliteration of force, and opposition to violence under any circumstance, even defence of self and others. Historians of pacifism Peter Brock and Thomas Paul Socknat define pacifism &quot;in the sense generally accepted in English-speaking areas&quot; as &quot;an unconditional rejection of all forms of warfare&quot;. Philosopher Jenny Teichman defines the main form of pacifism as &quot;anti-warism&quot;, the rejection of all forms of warfare. Teichman&#x27;s beliefs have been summarized by Brian Orend as &quot;... A pacifist rejects war and believes there are no moral grounds which can justify resorting to war. War, for the pacifist, is always wrong.&quot; In a sense the philosophy is based on the idea that the ends do not justify the means. The word &quot;pacific&quot; denotes conciliatory.

===Moral considerations===
Pacifism may be based on moral principles (a deontological view) or pragmatism (a consequentialist view). Principled pacifism holds that at some point along the spectrum from war to interpersonal physical violence, such violence becomes morally wrong. Pragmatic pacifism holds that the costs of war and interpersonal violence are so substantial that better ways of resolving disputes must be found.

===Nonviolence===
Some pacifists follow principles of nonviolence, believing that nonviolent action is morally superior and/or most effective. Some however, support physical violence for emergency defence of self or others. Others support destruction of property in such emergencies or for conducting symbolic acts of resistance like pouring red paint to represent blood on the outside of military recruiting offices or entering air force bases and hammering on military aircraft.

Not all nonviolent resistance (sometimes also called civil resistance) is based on a fundamental rejection of all violence in all circumstances. Many leaders and participants in such movements, while recognizing the importance of using non-violent methods in particular circumstances, have not been absolute pacifists. Sometimes, as with the civil rights movement&#x27;s march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965, they have called for armed protection. The interconnections between civil resistance and factors of force are numerous and complex.

==Types==
===Absolute pacifism===
An absolute pacifist is generally described by the BBC as one who believes that human life is so valuable, that a human should never be killed and war should never be conducted, even in self-defense (except for non-violence type). The principle is described as difficult to abide by consistently, due to violence not being available as a tool to aid a person who is being harmed or killed. It is further claimed that such a pacifist could logically argue that violence leads to more undesirable results than non-violence.

===Conditional pacifism===
Tapping into just war theory &quot;conditional pacifism&quot; represents a spectrum of positions departing from positions of absolute pacifism. One such conditional pacifism is the common pacificism, which may allow defense but is not advocating a default defensivism or even interventionism.

==Police actions and national liberation==
Although all pacifists are opposed to war between nation states, there have been occasions where pacifists have supported military conflict in the case of civil war or revolution. For instance, during the American Civil War, both the American Peace Society and some former members of the Non-Resistance Society supported the Union&#x27;s military campaign, arguing they were carrying out a &quot;police action&quot; against the Confederacy, whose act of Secession they regarded as criminal. Following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, French pacifist René Gérin urged support for the Spanish Republic. Gérin argued that the Spanish Nationalists were &quot;comparable to an individual enemy&quot; and the Republic&#x27;s war effort was equivalent to the action of a domestic police force suppressing crime.

In the 1960s, some pacifists associated with the New Left supported wars of national liberation and supported groups such as the Viet Cong and the Algerian FLN, arguing peaceful attempts to liberate such nations were no longer viable, and war was thus the only option.

==History==
===Early traditions===
Advocacy of pacifism can be found far back in history and literature.

====China====
During the Warring States period, the pacifist Mohist School opposed aggressive war between the feudal states. They took this belief into action by using their famed defensive strategies to defend smaller states from invasion from larger states, hoping to dissuade feudal lords from costly warfare. The Seven Military Classics of ancient China view warfare negatively, and as a last resort. For example, the &quot;Three Strategies of Huang Shigong&quot; says: &quot;As for the military, it is not an auspicious instrument; it is the way of heaven to despise it&quot;, and the &quot;Wei Liaozi&quot; writes: &quot;As for the military, it is an inauspicious instrument; as for conflict and contention, it runs counter to virtue&quot;.

The Taoist scripture &quot;&quot;Classic of Great Peace&quot; (&quot;Taiping jing&quot;)&quot; foretells &quot;the coming Age of Great Peace (&quot;Taiping&quot;)&quot;. The &quot;Taiping Jing&quot; advocates &quot;a world full of peace&quot;.

====Lemba====
The Lemba religion of southern French Congo, along with its symbolic herb, is named for pacifism : &quot;&quot;lemba, lemba&quot; (peace, peace), describes the action of the plant &quot;lemba-lemba&quot; (&quot;Brillantaisia patula T. Anders&quot;). Likewise in Cabinda, &quot;Lemba&quot; is the spirit of peace, as its name indicates.&quot;

====Moriori====
The Moriori, of the Chatham Islands, practiced pacifism by order of their ancestor Nunuku-whenua. This enabled the Moriori to preserve what limited resources they had in their harsh climate, avoiding waste through warfare. In turn, this led to their almost complete annihilation in 1835 by invading Ngāti Mutunga and Ngāti Tama Māori from the Taranaki region of the North Island of New Zealand. The invading Māori killed, enslaved and cannibalised the Moriori. A Moriori survivor recalled : &quot;[The Maori] commenced to kill us like sheep ... [We] were terrified, fled to the bush, concealed ourselves in holes underground, and in any place to escape our enemies. It was of no avail; we were discovered and killed – men, women and children indiscriminately.&quot;

====Greece====
In Ancient Greece, pacifism seems not to have existed except as a broad moral guideline against violence between individuals. No philosophical program of rejecting violence between states, or rejecting all forms of violence, seems to have existed. Aristophanes, in his play Lysistrata, creates the scenario of an Athenian woman&#x27;s anti-war sex strike during the Peloponnesian War of 431–404 BCE, and the play has gained an international reputation for its anti-war message. Nevertheless, it is both fictional and comical, and though it offers a pragmatic opposition to the destructiveness of war, its message seems to stem from frustration with the existing conflict (then in its twentieth year) rather than from a philosophical position against violence or war. Equally fictional is the nonviolent protest of Hegetorides of Thasos. Euripides also expressed strong anti-war ideas in his work, especially &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;.

In &quot;Plato&#x27;s Republic&quot; Socrates makes the pacifistic argument that a just person would not harm anyone. In Plato&#x27;s earlier work Crito Socrates asserts that it is not moral to return evil with further evil, an original moral conception, according to Gregory Vlastos, that undermines all justifications for war and violence.

====Roman Empire====
Several Roman writers rejected the militarism of Roman society and gave voice to anti-war sentiments,
including Propertius, Tibullus and Ovid. The Stoic Seneca the Younger criticised warfare in his book &quot;Naturales quaestiones&quot; (c. 65 CE).

Maximilian of Tebessa was a Christian conscientious objector. He was killed for refusing to be conscripted.

====Christianity====
Throughout history many have understood Jesus of Nazareth to have been a pacifist, drawing on his Sermon on the Mount. In the sermon Jesus stated that one should &quot;not resist an evildoer&quot; and promoted his turn the other cheek philosophy. &quot;If anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also; and if anyone wants to sue you and take your coat, give your cloak as well ... Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you.&quot; He also believed that murder is a sin and repeated the commandment of &quot;Thou shalt not kill&quot;. The New Testament story is of Jesus, besides preaching these words, surrendering himself freely to an enemy intent on having him killed and proscribing his followers from defending him.

There are those, however, who deny that Jesus was a pacifist and state that Jesus never said not to fight, citing examples from the New Testament. One such instance portrays an angry Jesus driving dishonest market traders from the temple. A frequently quoted passage is Luke 22:36: &quot;He said to them, &#x27;But now, the one who has a purse must take it, and likewise a bag. And the one who has no sword must sell his cloak and buy one.&#x27;&quot; Pacifists have typically explained that verse as Jesus fulfilling prophecy, since in the next verse, Jesus continues to say: &quot;It is written: &#x27;And he was numbered with the transgressors&#x27;; and I tell you that this must be fulfilled in me. Yes, what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment.&quot; Others have interpreted the non-pacifist statements in the New Testament to be related to self-defense or to be metaphorical and state that on no occasion did Jesus shed blood or urge others to shed blood.

===Modern history===
Beginning in the 16th century, the Protestant Reformation gave rise to a variety of new Christian sects, including the historic peace churches. Foremost among them were the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), Amish, Mennonites, Hutterites, and Church of the Brethren. The humanist writer Desiderius Erasmus was one of the most outspoken pacifists of the Renaissance, arguing strongly against warfare in his essays &quot;The Praise of Folly&quot; (1509) and &quot;The Complaint of Peace&quot; (1517).

The Quakers were prominent advocates of pacifism, who as early as 1660 had repudiated violence in all forms and adhered to a strictly pacifist interpretation of Christianity. They stated their beliefs in a declaration to King Charles II:
 &quot;We utterly deny all outward wars and strife, and fightings with outward weapons, for any end, or under any pretense whatever; this is our testimony to the whole world. The Spirit of Christ ... which leads us into all truth, will never move us to fight and war against any man with outward weapons, neither for the kingdom of Christ, nor for the kingdoms of this world.

Throughout the many 18th century wars in which Great Britain participated, the Quakers maintained a principled commitment not to serve in the army and militia or even to pay the alternative £10 fine.

The English Quaker William Penn, who founded the Province of Pennsylvania, employed an anti-militarist public policy. Unlike residents of many of the colonies, Quakers chose to trade peacefully with the Native Americans, including for land. The colonial province was, for the 75 years from 1681 to 1756, essentially unarmed and experienced little or no warfare in that period.

From the 16th to the 18th centuries, a number of thinkers devised plans for an international organisation that would promote peace, and reduce or even eliminate the occurrence of war. These included the French politician Duc de Sully, the philosophers Émeric Crucé and the Abbe de Saint-Pierre, and the English Quakers William Penn and John Bellers.

Pacifist ideals emerged from two strands of thought that coalesced at the end of the 18th century. One, rooted in the secular Enlightenment, promoted peace as the rational antidote to the world&#x27;s ills, while the other was a part of the evangelical religious revival that had played an important part in the campaign for the abolition of slavery. Representatives of the former included Jean-Jacques Rousseau, in &quot;Extrait du Projet de Paix Perpetuelle de Monsieur l&#x27;Abbe Saint-Pierre&quot; (1756), Immanuel Kant, in his &quot;Thoughts on Perpetual Peace&quot;, and Jeremy Bentham who proposed the formation of a peace association in 1789. Representative of the latter, was William Wilberforce who thought that strict limits should be imposed on British involvement in the French Revolutionary Wars based on Christian ideals of peace and brotherhood. Bohemian Bernard Bolzano taught about the social waste of militarism and the needlessness of war. He urged a total reform of the educational, social, and economic systems that would direct the nation&#x27;s interests toward peace rather than toward armed conflict between nations.

During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, pacifism was not entirely frowned upon throughout Europe. It was considered a political stance against costly capitalist-imperialist wars, a notion particularly popular in the British Liberal Party of the twentieth century. However, during the eras of World War One and especially World War Two, public opinion on the ideology split. Those against the Second World War, some argued, were not fighting against unnecessary wars of imperialism but instead acquiescing to the fascists of Germany, Italy and Japan.

====Peace movements====
During the period of the Napoleonic Wars, although no formal peace movement was established until the end of hostilities, a significant peace movement animated by universalist ideals did emerge, due to the perception of Britain fighting in a reactionary role and the increasingly visible impact of the war on the welfare of the nation in the form of higher taxation levels and high casualty rates. Sixteen peace petitions to Parliament were signed by members of the public, anti-war and anti-Pitt demonstrations convened and peace literature was widely published and disseminated.

The first peace movements appeared in 1815–16. In the United States the first such movement was the New York Peace Society, founded in 1815 by the theologian David Low Dodge, and the Massachusetts Peace Society. It became an active organization, holding regular weekly meetings, and producing literature which was spread as far as Gibraltar and Malta, describing the horrors of war and advocating pacificism on Christian grounds. The London Peace Society (also known as the Society for the Promotion of Permanent and Universal Peace) was formed in 1816 to promote permanent and universal peace by the philanthropist William Allen. In the 1840s, British women formed &quot;Olive Leaf Circles&quot;, groups of around 15 to 20 women, to discuss and promote pacifist ideas.

The peace movement began to grow in influence by the mid-nineteenth century. The London Peace Society, under the initiative of American consul Elihu Burritt and the reverend Henry Richard, convened the first International Peace Congress in London in 1843. The congress decided on two aims: the ideal of peaceable arbitration in the affairs of nations and the creation of an international institution to achieve that. Richard became the secretary of the Peace Society in 1850 on a full-time basis, a position which he would keep for the next 40 years, earning himself a reputation as the &#x27;Apostle of Peace&#x27;. He helped secure one of the earliest victories for the peace movement by securing a commitment from the Great Powers in the Treaty of Paris (1856) at the end of the Crimean War, in favour of arbitration. On the European continent, wracked by social upheaval, the first peace congress was held in Brussels in 1848 followed by Paris a year later.

After experiencing a recession in support due to the resurgence of militarism during the American Civil War and Crimean War, the movement began to spread across Europe and began to infiltrate the new socialist movements. In 1870, Randal Cremer formed the Workman&#x27;s Peace Association in London. Cremer, alongside the French economist Frédéric Passy was also the founding father of the first international organisation for the arbitration of conflicts in 1889, the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The National Peace Council was founded in after the 17th Universal Peace Congress in London (July August 1908).

An important thinker who contributed to pacifist ideology was Russian writer Leo Tolstoy. In one of his latter works, &quot;The Kingdom of God Is Within You&quot;, Tolstoy provides a detailed history, account and defense of pacifism. Tolstoy&#x27;s work inspired a movement named after him advocating pacifism to arise in Russia and elsewhere. The book was a major early influence on Mahatma Gandhi, and the two engaged in regular correspondence while Gandhi was active in South Africa.

Bertha von Suttner, the first woman to be a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, became a leading figure in the peace movement with the publication of her novel, &quot;Die Waffen nieder!&quot; (&quot;Lay Down Your Arms!&quot;) in 1889 and founded an Austrian pacifist organization in 1891.

====Nonviolent resistance====
In colonial New Zealand, during the latter half of the 19th century European settlers used numerous tactics to confiscate land from the indigenous Māori, including warfare. In the 1870s and 1880s, Parihaka, then reported to be the largest Māori settlement in New Zealand, became the centre of a major campaign of non-violent resistance to land confiscations. One Māori leader, Te Whiti-o-Rongomai, quickly became the leading figure in the movement, stating in a speech that &quot;Though some, in darkness of heart, seeing their land ravished, might wish to take arms and kill the aggressors, I say it must not be. Let not the Pakehas think to succeed by reason of their guns... I want not war&quot;. Te Whiti-o-Rongomai achieved renown for his non-violent tactics among the Māori, which proved more successful in preventing land confiscations than acts of violent resistance.

Mahatma Gandhi was a major political and spiritual leader of India, instrumental in the Indian independence movement. The Nobel prize winning great poet Rabindranath Tagore, who was also an Indian, gave him the honorific &quot;Mahatma&quot;, usually translated &quot;Great Soul&quot;. He was the pioneer of a brand of nonviolence (or &quot;ahimsa&quot;) which he called &quot;satyagraha&quot;translated literally as &quot;truth force&quot;. This was the resistance of tyranny through civil disobedience that was not only nonviolent but also sought to change the heart of the opponent. He contrasted this with &quot;duragraha&quot;, &quot;resistant force&quot;, which sought only to change behaviour with stubborn protest. During his 30 years of work (1917–1947) for the independence of his country from British colonial rule, Gandhi led dozens of nonviolent campaigns, spent over seven years in prison, and fasted nearly to the death on several occasions to obtain British compliance with a demand or to stop inter-communal violence. His efforts helped lead India to independence in 1947, and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom worldwide.

====World War I====
Peace movements became active in the Western world after 1900, often focusing on treaties that would settle disputes through arbitration, and efforts to support the Hague conventions.

The sudden outbreak of the First World War in July 1914 dismayed the peace movement. Socialist parties in every industrial nation had committed themselves to antiwar policies, but when the war came, all of them, except in Russia and the United States, supported their own governments. There were highly publicized dissidents, some of whom were imprisoned for opposing draft laws, such as Eugene Debs in the U.S. In Britain, the prominent activist Stephen Henry Hobhouse was jailed for refusing military service, citing his convictions as a &quot;socialist and a Christian&quot;. Many socialist groups and movements were antimilitarist, arguing that war by its nature was a type of governmental coercion of the working class for the benefit of capitalist elites. The French socialist pacifist leader Jean Jaurès was assassinated by a nationalist fanatic on 31 July 1914. The national parties in the Second International increasingly supported their respective nations in war, and the International was dissolved in 1916.

In 1915, the League of Nations Society was formed by British liberal leaders to promote a strong international organisation that could enforce the peaceful resolution of conflict. Later that year, the League to Enforce Peace was established in the U.S. to promote similar goals. Hamilton Holt published a 28 September 1914, editorial in his magazine the &quot;Independent&quot; called &quot;The Way to Disarm: A Practical Proposal&quot; that called for an international organization to agree upon the arbitration of disputes and to guarantee the territorial integrity of its members by maintaining military forces sufficient to defeat those of any non-member. The ensuing debate among prominent internationalists modified Holt&#x27;s plan to align it more closely with proposals offered in Great Britain by Viscount James Bryce, a former British ambassador to the United States. These and other initiatives were pivotal in the change in attitudes that gave birth to the League of Nations after the war.

In addition to the traditional peace churches, some of the many groups that protested against the war were the Woman&#x27;s Peace Party (which was organized in 1915 and led by noted reformer Jane Addams), the International Committee of Women for Permanent Peace (ICWPP) (also organized in 1915), the American Union Against Militarism, the Fellowship of Reconciliation and the American Friends Service Committee. Jeannette Rankin, the first woman elected to Congress, was another fierce advocate of pacifism, the only person to vote against American entrance into both wars.

====Between the two World Wars====
After the immense loss of nearly ten million men to trench warfare, a sweeping change of attitude toward militarism crashed over Europe, particularly in nations such as Great Britain, where many questioned its involvement in the war. After World War I&#x27;s official end in 1918, peace movements across the continent and the United States renewed, gradually gaining popularity among young Europeans who grew up in the shadow of Europe&#x27;s trauma over the Great War. Organizations formed in this period included the War Resisters&#x27; International, the Women&#x27;s International League for Peace and Freedom, the No More War Movement, the Service Civil International and the Peace Pledge Union (PPU). The League of Nations also convened several disarmament conferences in the interbellum period such as the Geneva Conference, though the support that pacifist policy and idealism received varied across European nations. These organizations and movements attracted tens of thousands of Europeans, spanning most professions including &quot;scientists, artists, musicians, politicians, clerks, students, activists and thinkers.&quot;

=====Great Britain=====
Pacifism and revulsion with war were very popular sentiments in 1920s Britain. Novels and poems on the theme of the futility of war and the slaughter of the youth by old fools were published, including, Death of a Hero by Richard Aldington, Erich Remarque&#x27;s translated All Quiet on the Western Front and Beverley Nichols&#x27;s expose &quot;Cry Havoc&quot;. A debate at the University of Oxford in 1933 on the motion &#x27;one must fight for King and country&#x27; captured the changed mood when the motion was resoundingly defeated. Dick Sheppard established the Peace Pledge Union in 1934, which totally renounced war and aggression. The idea of collective security was also popular; instead of outright pacifism, the public generally exhibited a determination to stand up to aggression, but preferably with the use of economic sanctions and multilateral negotiations. Many members of the Peace Pledge Union later joined the Bruderhof during its period of residence in the Cotswolds, where Englishmen and Germans, many of whom were Jewish, lived side by side despite local persecution.

The British Labour Party had a strong pacifist wing in the early 1930s, and between 1931 and 1935 it was led by George Lansbury, a Christian pacifist who later chaired the No More War Movement and was president of the PPU. The 1933 annual conference resolved unanimously to &quot;pledge itself to take no part in war&quot;. Researcher Richard Toye writes that &quot;Labour&#x27;s official position, however, although based on the aspiration towards a world socialist commonwealth and the outlawing of war, did not imply a renunciation of force under all circumstances, but rather support for the ill-defined concept of &#x27;collective security&#x27; under the League of Nations. At the same time, on the party&#x27;s left, Stafford Cripps&#x27;s small but vocal Socialist League opposed the official policy, on the non-pacifist ground that the League of Nations was &#x27;nothing but the tool of the satiated imperialist powers&#x27;.&quot;

Lansbury was eventually persuaded to resign as Labour leader by the non-pacifist wing of the party and was replaced by Clement Attlee. As the threat from Nazi Germany increased in the 1930s, the Labour Party abandoned its pacifist position and supported rearmament, largely as the result of the efforts of Ernest Bevin and Hugh Dalton, who by 1937 had also persuaded the party to oppose Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s policy of appeasement.

The League of Nations attempted to play its role in ensuring world peace in the 1920s and 1930s. However, with the increasingly revisionist and aggressive behaviour of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan, it ultimately failed to maintain such a world order. Economic sanctions were used against states that committed aggression, such as those against Italy when it invaded Abyssinia, but there was no will on the part of the principal League powers, Britain and France, to subordinate their interests to a multilateral process or to disarm at all themselves.

=====Spain=====
The Spanish Civil War proved a major test for international pacifism, and the work of pacifist organisations (such as War Resisters&#x27; International and the Fellowship of Reconciliation) and individuals (such as José Brocca and Amparo Poch) in that arena has until recently been ignored or forgotten by historians, overshadowed by the memory of the International Brigades and other militaristic interventions. Shortly after the war ended, Simone Weil, despite having volunteered for service on the republican side, went on to publish &quot;The Iliad or the Poem of Force&quot;, a work that has been described as a pacifist manifesto. In response to the threat of fascism, some pacifist thinkers, such as Richard B. Gregg, devised plans for a campaign of nonviolent resistance in the event of a fascist invasion or takeover.

=====France=====
As the prospect of a second major war began to seem increasingly inevitable, much of France adopted pacifist views, though some historians argue that France felt more war anxiety than a moral objection to a second war. Hitler&#x27;s spreading influence and territory posed an enormous threat to French livelihood from their neighbors. The French countryside had been devastated during World War I and the entire nation was reluctant to subject its territory to the same treatment. Though all countries in the First World War had suffered great losses, France was one of the most devastated and many did not want a second war.

=====Germany=====
As Germany dealt with the burdens of the Treaty of Versailles, a conflict arose in the 1930s between German Christianity and German nationalism. Many Germans found the terms of the treaty debilitating and humiliating, so German nationalism offered a way to regain the country&#x27;s pride. German Christianity warned against the risks of entering a war similar to the previous one. As the German depression worsened and fascism began to rise in Germany, a greater tide of Germans began to sway toward Hitler&#x27;s brand of nationalism that would come to crush pacifism.

====World War II====
With the start of World War II, pacifist and antiwar sentiment declined in nations affected by the war. Even the communist-controlled American Peace Mobilization reversed its antiwar activism once Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the non-interventionist America First Committee dropped its opposition to American involvement in the war and disbanded, but many smaller religious and socialist groups continued their opposition to war.

=====Great Britain=====
Bertrand Russell argued that the necessity of defeating Adolf Hitler and the Nazis was a unique circumstance in which war was not the worst of the possible evils; he called his position &quot;relative pacifism&quot;. Shortly before the outbreak of war, British writers such as E. M. Forster, Leonard Woolf, David Garnett and Storm Jameson all rejected their earlier pacifism and endorsed military action against Nazism. Similarly, Albert Einstein wrote: &quot;I loathe all armies and any kind of violence; yet I&#x27;m firmly convinced that at present these hateful weapons offer the only effective protection.&quot; The British pacifists Reginald Sorensen and C. J. Cadoux, while bitterly disappointed by the outbreak of war, nevertheless urged their fellow pacifists &quot;not to obstruct the war effort.&quot;

Pacifists across Great Britain further struggled to uphold their anti-military values during the Blitz, a coordinated, long-term attack by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; on Great Britain. As the country was ravaged nightly by German bombing raids, pacifists had to seriously weigh the importance of their political and moral values against the desire to protect their nation.

=====France=====
Some scholars theorize that pacifism was the cause of France&#x27;s rapid fall to the Germans after it was invaded by the Nazis in June 1940, resulting in a takeover of the government by the German military. Whether or not pacifism weakened French defenses against the Germans, there was no hope of sustaining a real pacifist movement after Paris fell. Just as peaceful Germans succumbed to violent nationalism, the pacifist French were muzzled by the totality of German control over nearly all of France.

The French pacifists André and Magda Trocmé helped conceal hundreds of Jews fleeing the Nazis in the village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon. After the war, the Trocmés were declared Righteous Among the Nations.

=====Germany=====
Pacifists in Nazi Germany were dealt with harshly, reducing the movement into almost nonexistence; those who continued to advocate for the end of the war and violence were often sent to labor camps; German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky and Olaf Kullmann, a Norwegian pacifist active during the Nazi occupation, were both imprisoned in concentration camps and died as a result of their mistreatment there. Austrian farmer Franz Jägerstätter was executed in 1943 for refusing to serve in the Wehrmacht.

German nationalism consumed even the most peaceful of Christians, who may have believed that Hitler was acting in the good faith of Germany or who may have been so suppressed by the Nazi regime that they were content to act as bystanders to the violence occurring around them. Dietrich Bonhoeffer, an anti-Nazi German pastor who later died in 1945 in the Flossenbürg concentration camp, once wrote in a letter to his grandmother: &quot;The issue really is: Germanism or Christianity.&quot;

After the end of the war, it was discovered that &quot;The Black Book&quot; or &quot;Sonderfahndungsliste G.B.&quot;, a list of Britons to be arrested in the event of a successful German invasion of Britain, included three active pacifists: Vera Brittain, Sybil Thorndike and Aldous Huxley (who had left the country).

=====Conscientious objectors=====
There were conscientious objectors and war tax resisters in both World War I and World War II. The United States government allowed sincere objectors to serve in noncombatant military roles. However, those draft resisters who refused any cooperation with the war effort often spent much of the wars in federal prisons. During World War II, pacifist leaders such as Dorothy Day and Ammon Hennacy of the Catholic Worker Movement urged young Americans not to enlist in military service.

During the two world wars, young men conscripted into the military, but who refused to take up arms, were called conscientious objectors. Though these men had to either answer their conscription or face prison time, their status as conscientious objectors permitted them to refuse to take part in battle using weapons, and the military was forced to find a different use for them. Often, these men were assigned various tasks close to battle such as medical duties, though some were assigned various civilian jobs including farming, forestry, hospital work and mining. Conscientious objectors were often viewed by soldiers as cowards and liars, and they were sometimes accused of shirking military duty out of fear rather than as the result of conscience. In Great Britain during World War II, the majority of the public did not approve of moral objection by soldiers but supported their right to abstain from direct combat. On the more extreme sides of public opinion were those who fully supported the objectors and those who believed they should be executed as traitors. The World War II objectors were often scorned as fascist sympathizers and traitors, though many of them cited the influence of World War I and their shell shocked fathers as major reasons for refusing to participate.

====Later 20th century====

Baptist minister Martin Luther King Jr. led a civil rights movement in the U.S., employing Gandhian nonviolent resistance to repeal laws enforcing racial segregation and to work for integration of schools, businesses and government. In 1957, his wife Coretta Scott King, along with Albert Schweitzer, Benjamin Spock and others, formed the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (now Peace Action) to resist the nuclear arms race. In 1958 British activists formed the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament with Bertrand Russell as its president.

In 1960, Thich Nhat Hanh came to the U.S. to study comparative religion at Princeton University and was subsequently appointed a lecturer in Buddhism at Columbia University. Nhất Hạnh had written a letter to King in 1965 entitled &quot;Searching for the Enemy of Man&quot; and met with King in 1966 to urge him to publicly denounce the Vietnam War. In a famous 1967 speech at Riverside Church in New York City, King publicly questioned the U.S. involvement in Vietnam for the first time.

Other examples from this period include the 1986 People Power Revolution in the Philippines led by Corazon Aquino and the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, with the broadly publicized &quot;Tank Man&quot; incident as its indelible image.

On 1 December 1948, President José Figueres Ferrer of Costa Rica abolished the Costa Rican military. In 1949, the abolition of the military was introduced in Article 12 of the Costa Rican constitution. The budget previously dedicated to the military is now dedicated to providing healthcare services and education.

Within the halls of academe, several philosophers endeavored to demonstrate that the theoretical principles underlying secular pacifism could be successfully applied in order to resolve several unique forms of international conflict which emerged as the 20th century came to a close. Included in this group is Robert L. Holmes, who illustrates that four principles of &quot;moral personalism&quot; can be utilized within the context of both nuclear war and terrorism in order to promote an ethically viable outcome. He further argues that waging war in the modern era is unjustifiable when considered in its totality and that by transcending the particular perceptions of injustice in a conflict it is possible to be a &quot;pragmatic pacifist&quot;.

==Religious attitudes==

===Baháʼí Faith===
Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith abolished holy war and emphasized its abolition as a central teaching of his faith. However, the Baháʼí Faith does not have an absolute pacifistic position. For example, Baháʼís are advised to do social service instead of active army service, but when this is not possible because of obligations in certain countries, the Baháʼí law of &quot;loyalty to one&#x27;s government&quot; is preferred and the individual should perform the army service. Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Baháʼí Faith in the first half of the 20th century, noted that in the Baháʼí view, absolute pacifists are anti-social and exalt the individual over society which could lead to anarchy; instead he noted that the Baháʼí conception of social life follows a moderate view where the individual is not suppressed or exalted.

On the level of society, Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh promotes the principle of collective security, which does not abolish the use of force, but prescribes &quot;a system in which Force is made the servant of Justice&quot;. The idea of collective security from the Bahá&#x27;í teachings states that if a government violates a fundamental norm of international law or provision of a future world constitution which Bahá&#x27;ís believe will be established by all nations, then the other governments should step in.

===Buddhism===
Ahimsa (do no harm), is a primary virtue in Buddhism (as well as other Indian religions such as Hinduism and Jainism). This leads to a misconception that Buddhism is a religion based solely on peace; however, like all religions, there is a long history of violence in various Buddhist traditions and many examples of prolonged violence in its 2,500-year existence. Like many religious scholars and believers of other religions, many Buddhists disavow any connection between their religion and the violence committed in its name or by its followers, and find various ways of dealing with problematic texts.

Notable pacifists or peace activists within Buddhist traditions include Thích Nhất Hạnh who advocated for peace in response to the Vietnam War, founded the Plum Village Tradition, and helped popularize engaged Buddhism, Robert Baker Aitken and Anne Hopkins Aitken who founded the Buddhist Peace Fellowship, Cheng Yen founder of the Tzu Chi Foundation, Bhikkhu Bodhi American Theravada Buddhist monk and founder of Buddhist Global Relief, Thai activist and author Sulak Sivaraksa, Cambodian activist Preah Maha Ghosananda. and Japanese activist and peace pagoda builder Nichidatsu Fujii.

===Christianity===


====Peace churches====
Peace churches are Christian denominations explicitly advocating pacifism. The term &quot;historic peace churches&quot; refers specifically to three church traditions: the Church of the Brethren, the Mennonites (and other Anabaptists, such as the Amish, Hutterites and Apostolic Christian Church), as well as the Quakers (Religious Society of Friends). The historic peace churches have, from their origins as far back as the 16th century, always taken the position that Jesus was himself a pacifist who explicitly taught and practiced pacifism, and that his followers must do likewise. Pacifist churches vary on whether physical force can ever be justified in self-defense or protecting others, as many adhere strictly to nonresistance when confronted by violence. But all agree that violence on behalf of a country or a government is prohibited for Christians.

====Holiness movement====
The Emmanuel Association of Churches, Immanuel Missionary Church, Church of God (Guthrie, Oklahoma), First Bible Holiness Church, and Christ&#x27;s Sanctified Holy Church are denominations in the holiness movement (which is largely Methodist with a minority from other backgrounds such as Quaker, Anabaptist and Restorationist) known for their opposition to war today; they are known as &quot;holiness pacifists&quot;. The Emmanuel Association teaches:
====Pentecostal churches====
Jay Beaman&#x27;s thesis states that 13 of 21, or 62% of American Pentecostal groups formed by 1917 show evidence of being pacifist sometime in their history. Furthermore, Jay Beaman has shown in his thesis that there has been a shift away from pacifism in the American Pentecostal churches to more a style of military support and chaplaincy. The major organisation for Pentecostal Christians who believe in pacifism is the PCPF, the Pentecostal Charismatic Peace Fellowship.

The United Pentecostal Church, the largest Apostolic/Oneness denomination, takes an official stand of conscientious objection: its Articles of Faith read, &quot;We are constrained to declare against participating in combatant service in war, armed insurrection ... aiding or abetting in or the actual destruction of human life. We believe that we can be consistent in serving our Government in certain noncombatant capacities, but not in the bearing of arms.&quot;

====Other denominations====
The Peace Pledge Union is a pacifist organisation from which the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship (APF) later emerged within the Anglican Church. The APF succeeded in gaining ratification of the pacifist position at two successive Lambeth Conferences, but many Anglicans would not regard themselves as pacifists. South African Bishop Desmond Tutu is the most prominent Anglican pacifist. Rowan Williams led an almost united Anglican Church in Britain in opposition to the 2003 Iraq War. In Australia Peter Carnley similarly led a front of bishops opposed to the Government of Australia&#x27;s involvement in the invasion of Iraq.

The Catholic Worker Movement is concerned with both social justice and pacifist issues, and voiced consistent opposition to the Spanish Civil War and World War II. Many of its early members were imprisoned for their opposition to conscription. Within the Roman Catholic Church, the Pax Christi organisation is the premier pacifist lobby group. It holds positions similar to APF, and the two organisations are known to work together on ecumenical projects. Within Roman Catholicism there has been a discernible move towards a more pacifist position through the twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Popes Benedict XV, John XXIII and John Paul II were all vocal in their opposition to specific wars. By taking the name Benedict XVI, some suspected that Joseph Ratzinger would continue the strong emphasis upon nonviolent conflict resolution of his predecessor. However, the Roman Catholic Church officially maintains the legitimacy of Just War, which is rejected by some pacifists.

In the twentieth century, there was a notable trend among prominent Roman Catholics towards pacifism. Individuals such as Dorothy Day and Henri Nouwen stand out among them. The monk and mystic Thomas Merton was noted for his commitment to pacifism during the Vietnam War era. Murdered Salvadoran Bishop Óscar Romero was notable for using non-violent resistance tactics and wrote meditative sermons focusing on the power of prayer and peace. School of the Americas Watch was founded by Maryknoll Fr. Roy Bourgeois in 1990 and uses strictly pacifist principles to protest the training of Latin American military officers by United States Army officers at the School of the Americas in the state of Georgia.

The Southern Baptist Convention has stated in the Baptist Faith and Message, &quot;It is the duty of Christians to seek peace with all men on principles of righteousness. In accordance with the spirit and teachings of Christ they should do all in their power to put an end to war.&quot;

The United Methodist Church explicitly supports conscientious objection by its members &quot;as an ethically valid position&quot; while simultaneously allowing for differences of opinion and belief for those who do not object to military service.

Members of the Rastafari Movement&#x27;s Mansion Nyabinghi are specifically noted for having a large population of Pacifist members, though not all of them are.

===Hinduism===
Nonviolence, or ahimsa, is a central part of Hinduism and is one of the fundamental Yamas – self restraints needed to live a proper life. The concept of ahimsa grew gradually within Hinduism, one of the signs being the discouragement of ritual animal sacrifice. Many Hindus today have a vegetarian diet. The classical texts of Hinduism devote numerous chapters discussing what people who practice the virtue of Ahimsa, can and must do when they are faced with war, violent threat or need to sentence someone convicted of a crime. These discussions have led to theories of just war, theories of reasonable self-defence and theories of proportionate punishment. Arthashastra discusses, among other things, why and what constitutes proportionate response and punishment.
The precepts of Ahimsa under Hinduism require that war must be avoided, with sincere and truthful dialogue. Force must be the last resort. If war becomes necessary, its cause must be just, its purpose virtuous, its objective to restrain the wicked, its aim peace, its method lawful. While the war is in progress, sincere dialogue for peace must continue.

===Islam===

Different Muslim movements through history had linked pacifism with Muslim theology. However, warfare has been integral part of Islamic history both for the defense and the spread of the faith since the time of Muhammad.

Peace is an important aspect of Islam, and Muslims are encouraged to strive for peace and peaceful solutions to all problems. However, most Muslims are generally not pacifists, as the teachings in the Qur&#x27;an and Hadith allow for wars to be fought if they are justified.

====Sufism====
Prior to the Hijra travel, Muhammad struggled non-violently against his opposition in Mecca, providing a basis for Islamic pacifist schools of thought such as some Sufi orders.

In the 13th century, Salim Suwari a philosopher in Islam, came up with a peaceful approach to Islam known as the Suwarian tradition.

The earliest massive non-violent implementation of civil disobedience was brought about by Egyptians against the British in the Egyptian Revolution of 1919.

Khān Abdul Ghaffār Khān was a Pashtun independence activist against British colonial rule. He was a political and spiritual leader known for his nonviolent opposition, and a lifelong pacifist and devout Muslim. A close friend of Mahatma Gandhi, Bacha Khan was nicknamed the &quot;Frontier Gandhi&quot; in British India. Bacha Khan founded the Khudai Khidmatgar (&quot;Servants of God&quot;) movement in 1929, whose success triggered severe crackdowns by the colonial government against Khan and his supporters, and they experienced some of the strongest repression of the Indian independence movement.

====Ahmadiyya====
According to the Ahmadiyya understanding of Islam, pacifism is a strong current, and jihad is one&#x27;s personal inner struggle and should not be used violently for political motives. Violence is the last option only to be used to protect religion and one&#x27;s own life in extreme situations of persecution. Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community, said that in contrary to the current views, Islam &quot;does not allow the use of sword in religion, except in the case of defensive wars, wars waged to punish a tyrant, or those meant to uphold freedom&quot;.

Ahmadiyya claims its objective to be the peaceful propagation of Islam with special emphasis on spreading the true message of Islam by the pen. Ahmadis point out that as per prophecy, who they believe was the promised messiah, Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, rendered the concept of violent jihad unnecessary in modern times. They believe that the answer of hate should be given by love. Many Muslims consider Ahmadi Muslims as either &quot;kafirs&quot; or heretics, an animosity sometimes resulting in murder.

===Jainism===
Absolute Non-violence and compassion for all life is central to Jainism. Human life is valued as a unique, rare opportunity to reach enlightenment. Killing any person or living creature seen or unseen, no matter what crime may have committed, is considered unimaginably terrible. It is a religion that requires monks, from all its sects and traditions, to be lacto-vegetarianism. Most or all Jains are lacto-vegetarians. Some Indian regions, such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh have been strongly influenced by Jains and often the majority of the local Hindus of every denomination are also lacto-vegetarian.

===Judaism===
Although Judaism is not a pacifist religion, it does believe that peace is highly desirable. Most Jews will hope to limit or minimise conflict and violence but they accept that, given human nature and the situations which arise from time to time in the world, there will be occasions when violence and war may be justified. The Jewish Peace Fellowship is a New-York based nonprofit, nondenominational organization set up to provide a Jewish voice in the peace movement. The organization was founded in 1941 in order to support Jewish conscientious objectors who sought exemption from combatant military service. It is affiliated to the International Fellowship of Reconciliation. The fringe Neturei Karta group of anti-Zionist, ultra-orthodox Jews, supposedly take a pacifist line, saying that &quot;Jews are not allowed to dominate, kill, harm or demean another people and are not allowed to have anything to do with the Zionist enterprise, their political meddling and their wars.&quot; The Hebrew Bible has many examples of Jews being told to go and war against enemy lands or within the Israelite community as well as instances where God, as destroyer and protector, goes to war for non-participant Jews.

==Government and political movements==
While many governments have tolerated pacifist views and even accommodated pacifists&#x27; refusal to fight in wars, others at times have outlawed pacifist and anti-war activity. In 1918, The United States Congress passed the Sedition Act of 1918. During the periods between World Wars I and World War II, pacifist literature and public advocacy was banned in Italy under Benito Mussolini, Germany after the rise of Adolf Hitler, Spain under Francisco Franco, and the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin. In these nations, pacifism was denounced as cowardice; indeed, Mussolini referred to pacifist writings as the &quot;propaganda of cowardice&quot;.

Today, the United States requires that all young men register for selective service but does not allow them to be classified as conscientious objectors unless they are drafted in some future reinstatement of the draft, allowing them to be discharged or transferred to noncombatant status. Some European governments like Switzerland, Greece, Norway and Germany offer civilian service. However, even during periods of peace, many pacifists still refuse to register for or report for military duty, risking criminal charges.

Anti-war and &quot;pacifist&quot; political parties seeking to win elections may moderate their demands, calling for de-escalation or major arms reduction rather than the outright disarmament which is advocated by many pacifists. Green parties list &quot;non-violence&quot; and &quot;decentralization&quot; towards anarchist co-operatives or minimalist village government as two of their ten key values. However, in power, Greens often compromise. The German Greens in the cabinet of Social Democrat Gerhard Schröder supported an intervention by German troops in Afghanistan in 2001 if that they hosted the peace conference in Berlin. However, during the 2002 election Greens forced Schröder to swear that no German troops would invade Iraq.

Some pacifists and multilateralists are in favor of international criminal law as means to prevent and control international aggression. The International Criminal Court has jurisdiction over war crimes, but the crime of aggression has yet to be clearly defined in international law.

The Italian Constitution enforces a mild pacifist character on the Italian Republic, as Article 11 states that &quot;Italy repudiates war as an instrument offending the liberty of the peoples and as a means for settling international disputes ...&quot; Similarly, Articles 24, 25 and 26 of the German Constitution (1949), Alinea 15 of the French Constitution (1946), Article 20 of the Danish Constitution (1953), Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution (1947) and several other mostly European constitutions correspond to the United Nations Charter by rejecting the institution of war in favour of collective security and peaceful cooperation.

===Pacifism and abstention from political activity===
However, some pacifists, such as the Christian anarchist Leo Tolstoy and autarchist Robert LeFevre, consider the state a form of warfare. In addition, for doctrinal reason that a manmade government is inferior to divine governance and law, many pacifist-identified religions/religious sects also refrain from political activity altogether, including the Anabaptists, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and Mandaeans. This means that such groups refuse to participate in government office or serve under an oath to a government.

===Anarcho-pacifism===

Anarcho-pacifism is a form of anarchism which completely rejects the use of violence in any form for any purpose. The main precedent was Henry David Thoreau who through his work Civil Disobedience influenced the advocacy of both Leo Tolstoy and Mahatma Gandhi for nonviolent resistance. As a global movement, anarcho-pacifism emerged shortly before World War II in the Netherlands, Great Britain and the United States and was a strong presence in the subsequent campaigns for nuclear disarmament.

Violence has always been controversial in anarchism. While many anarchists during the 19th century embraced propaganda of the deed, Leo Tolstoy and other anarcho-pacifists directly opposed violence as a means for change. He argued that anarchism must by nature be nonviolent since it is, by definition, opposition to coercion and force and since the state is inherently violent, meaningful pacifism must likewise be anarchistic. His philosophy was cited as a major inspiration by Mahatma Gandhi, an Indian independence leader and pacifist who self-identified as an anarchist. Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis was also instrumental in establishing the pacifist trend within the anarchist movement. In France, anti-militarism appeared strongly in individualist anarchist circles as Émile Armand founded &quot;Ligue Antimilitariste&quot; in 1902 with Albert Libertad and George Mathias Paraf-Javal.

===Opposition to military taxation===

Many pacifists who would be conscientious objectors to military service are also opposed to paying taxes to fund the military. In the United States, the National Campaign for a Peace Tax Fund works to pass a national law to allow conscientious objectors to redirect their tax money to be used only for non-military purposes.

==Criticism==
One common argument against pacifism is the possibility of using violence to prevent further acts of violence (and reduce the &quot;net-sum&quot; of violence). This argument hinges on consequentialism: an otherwise morally objectionable action can be justified if it results in a positive outcome. For example, either violent rebellion, or foreign nations sending in troops to end a dictator&#x27;s violent oppression may save millions of lives, even if many thousands died in the war. Those pacifists who base their beliefs on deontological grounds would oppose such violent action. Others would oppose organized military responses but support individual and small group self-defense against specific attacks if initiated by the dictator&#x27;s forces. Pacifists may argue that military action could be justified should it subsequently advance the general cause of peace.

Still more pacifists would argue that a nonviolent reaction may not save lives immediately but would in the long run. The acceptance of violence for any reason makes it easier to use in other situations. Learning and committing to pacifism helps to send a message that violence is, in fact, not the most effective way. It can also help people to think more creatively and find more effective ways to stop violence without more violence.

In light of the common criticism of pacifism as not offering a clear alternative policy, one approach to finding &quot;more effective ways&quot; has been the attempt to develop the idea of &quot;defence by civil resistance&quot;, also called &quot;social defence&quot;. This idea, which is not necessarily dependent on acceptance of pacifist beliefs, is based on relying on nonviolent resistance against possible threats, whether external (such as invasion) or internal (such as coup d&#x27;état).
There have been some works on this topic, including by Adam Roberts and Gene Sharp. However, no country has adopted this approach as the sole basis of its defence. (For further information and sources see social defence.)

Axis aggression that precipitated World War II has been cited as an argument against pacifism. If these forces had not been challenged and defeated militarily, the argument goes, many more people would have died under their oppressive rule. Adolf Hitler told the British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in 1937 that the British should &quot;shoot Gandhi, and if this doesn&#x27;t suffice to reduce them to submission, shoot a dozen leading members of the Congress, and if that doesn&#x27;t suffice shoot 200, and so on, as you make it clear that you mean business.&quot;

Adolf Hitler noted in his Second Book: &quot;... Later, the attempt to adapt the living space to increased population turned into unmotivated wars of conquest, which in their very lack of motivation contained the germ of the subsequent reaction. Pacifism is the answer to it. Pacifism has existed in the world ever since there have been wars whose meaning no longer lay in the conquest of territory for a Folk&#x27;s sustenance. Since then it has been war&#x27;s eternal companion. It will again disappear as soon as war ceases to be an instrument of booty hungry or power hungry individuals or nations, and as soon as it again becomes the ultimate weapon with which a Folk fights for its daily bread.&quot;

Hermann Göring described, during an interview at the Nuremberg Trials, how denouncing and outlawing pacifism was an important part of the Nazis&#x27; seizure of power: &quot;The people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.&quot;

Some commentators on the most nonviolent forms of pacifism, including Jan Narveson, argue that such pacifism is a self-contradictory doctrine. Narveson claims that everyone has rights and corresponding responsibilities not to violate others&#x27; rights. Since pacifists give up their ability to protect themselves from violation of their right not to be harmed, then other people thus have no corresponding responsibility, thus creating a paradox of rights. Narveson said that &quot;the prevention of infractions of that right is precisely what one has a right to when one has a right at all.&quot; Narveson then discusses how rational persuasion is a good but often inadequate method of discouraging an aggressor. He considers that everyone has the right to use any means necessary to prevent deprivation of their civil liberties, and force could be necessary. Peter Gelderloos criticizes the idea that nonviolence is the only way to fight for a better world. According to Gelderloos, pacifism as an ideology serves the interests of the state and is hopelessly caught up psychologically with the control schema of patriarchy and white supremacy. Anne Appelbaum has argued that advocating pacifism in response to the Russo-Ukrainian War overlooks the lessons of history, as surrendering territory and principles enables atrocities, and early military support for Ukraine might have deterred the invasion, revealing that misguided pacifism can sometimes lead to greater conflict.

<doc id="24959" wikidata="Q3088443" url="?curid=24959" title="Proteinoid">
<text>Proteinoids, or thermal proteins, are protein-like, often cross-linked molecules formed abiotically from amino acids. Sidney W. Fox initially proposed that they may have been precursors to the first living cells (protocells). The term was also used in the 1960s to describe peptides that are shorter than twenty amino acids found in hydrolysed protein, but this term is no longer commonly used.

==History==

In trying to uncover the intermediate stages of abiogenesis, scientist Sidney W. Fox in the 1950s and 1960s, studied the spontaneous formation of peptide structures under conditions that might plausibly have existed early in Earth&#x27;s history. He demonstrated that amino acids could spontaneously form small chains called peptides. In one of his experiments, he allowed amino acids to dry out as if puddled in a warm, dry spot in prebiotic conditions. He found that, as they dried, the amino acids formed long, often cross-linked, thread-like microscopic polypeptide globules, he named &quot;proteinoid microspheres&quot;.

==Polymerization==
The abiotic polymerization of amino acids into proteins through the formation of peptide bonds was thought to occur only at temperatures over 140 °C. However, the biochemist Sidney Walter Fox and his co-workers discovered that phosphoric acid acted as a catalyst for this reaction. They were able to form protein-like chains from a mixture of 18 common amino acids at 70 °C in the presence of phosphoric acid, and dubbed these protein-like chains proteinoids. Fox later found naturally occurring proteinoids similar to those he had created in his laboratory in lava and cinders from Hawaiian volcanic vents and determined that the amino acids present polymerized due to the heat of escaping gases and lava. Other catalysts have since been found; one of them, amidinium carbodiimide, is formed in primitive Earth experiments and is effective in dilute aqueous solutions.

When present in certain concentrations in aqueous solutions, proteinoids form small microspheres. This is because some of the amino acids incorporated into proteinoid chains are more hydrophobic than others, and so proteinoids cluster together like droplets of oil in water. These structures exhibit a few characteristics of living cells:

#An outer wall.
#Osmotic swelling and shrinking.
#Budding.
#Binary fission (dividing into two daughter microspheres).
#Streaming movement of internal particles.

Fox thought that the microspheres may have provided a cell compartment within which organic molecules could have become concentrated and protected from the outside environment during the process of chemical evolution.

Proteinoid microspheres are today being considered for use in pharmaceuticals, providing microscopic biodegradable capsules in which to package and deliver oral drugs.

In another experiment using a similar method to set suitable conditions for life to form, Fox collected volcanic material from a cinder cone in Hawaii. He discovered that the temperature was over just beneath the surface of the cinder cone, and suggested that this might have been the environment in which life was created—molecules could have formed and then been washed through the loose volcanic ash and into the sea. He placed lumps of lava over amino acids derived from methane, ammonia and water, sterilized all materials, and baked the lava over the amino acids for a few hours in a glass oven. A brown, sticky substance formed over the surface and when the lava was drenched in sterilized water a thick, brown liquid leached out. It turned out that the amino acids had combined to form proteinoids, and the proteinoids had combined to form small spheres. Fox called these &quot;microspheres&quot;. His protobionts were not cells, although they formed clumps and chains reminiscent of bacteria. Based upon such experiments, Colin Pittendrigh stated in December 1967 that &quot;laboratories will be creating a living cell within ten years,&quot; a remark that reflected the typical contemporary levels of ignorance of the complexity of cell structures.

==Legacy==

Fox has likened the amino acid globules to cells, and proposed it bridged the macromolecule to cell transition. However, his hypothesis was later dismissed as proteinoids are not proteins, they feature mostly non-peptide bonds and amino acid cross-linkages not present in living organisms. Furthermore, they have no compartmentalization and there is no information content in the molecules.

Although their role as an evolutionary precursor has been superseded, the hypothesis was a catalyst to further investigate other mechanisms that could have brought about abiogenesis, such as the RNA world, PAH world, Iron–sulfur world, and protocell hypotheses.

<doc id="24960" wikidata="Q838946" url="?curid=24960" title="Permanent Court of International Justice">
<text>The Permanent Court of International Justice, often called the World Court, existed from 1922 to 1946. It was an international court attached to the League of Nations. Created in 1920 (although the idea of an international court was several centuries old), the court was initially well-received from states and academics alike, with many cases submitted to it for its first decade of operation.

Between 1922 and 1940 the court heard a total of 29 cases and delivered 27 separate advisory opinions. With the heightened international tension in the 1930s, the court became less used. By a resolution from the League of Nations on 18 April 1946, both the court and the league ceased to exist and were replaced by the International Court of Justice and the United Nations.

The court&#x27;s mandatory jurisdiction came from three sources: the Optional Clause of the League of Nations, general international conventions and special bipartite international treaties. Cases could also be submitted directly by states, but they were not bound to submit material unless it fell into those three categories. The court could issue either judgments or advisory opinions. Judgments were directly binding but not advisory opinions. In practice, member states of the League of Nations followed advisory opinions anyway for fear of possibly undermining the moral and legal authority of the court and the league.

== History ==

=== Founding and early years ===
An international court had long been proposed; Pierre Dubois suggested it in 1305 and Émeric Crucé in 1623. An idea of an international court of justice arose in the political world at the First Hague Peace Conference in 1899, where it was declared that arbitration between states was the easiest solution to disputes, providing a temporary panel of judges to arbitrate in such cases, the Permanent Court of Arbitration. At the Second Hague Peace Conference in 1907, a draft convention for a permanent Court of Arbitral Justice was written although disputes and other pressing business at the Conference meant that such a body was never established, owing to difficulties agreeing on a procedure to select the judges. The outbreak of the First World War, and, in particular, its conclusion made it clear to many academics that some kind of world court was needed, and it was widely expected that one would be established. Article 14 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, created after the Treaty of Versailles, allowed the league to investigate setting up an international court. In June 1920, an Advisory Committee of jurists appointed by the League of Nations finally established a working guideline for the appointment of judges, and the committee was then authorised to draft a constitution for a permanent court not of arbitration but of justice. The Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice was accepted in Geneva on December 13, 1920.

The court first sat on 30 January 1922, at the Peace Palace, The Hague, covering preliminary business during the first session (such as establishing procedure and appointing officers) Nine judges sat, along with three deputies, since Antonio Sánchez de Bustamante y Sirven, Ruy Barbosa and Wang Ch&#x27;ung-hui were unable to attend, the last being at the Washington Naval Conference. The court elected Bernard Loder as president and Max Huber as vice-president; Huber was replaced by André Weiss a month later. On 14 February the court was officially opened, and rules of procedure were established on 24 March, when the court ended its first session. The court first sat to decide cases on 15 June. During its first year of business, the court issued three advisory opinions, all related to the International Labour Organization created by the Treaty of Versailles.

The initial reaction to the court was good, from politicians, practising lawyers and academics alike. Ernest Pollock, the former Attorney General for England and Wales said, &quot;May we not as lawyers regard the establishment of an International Court of Justice as an advance in the science that we pursue?&quot; John Henry Wigmore said that the creation of the court &quot;should have given every lawyer a thrill of cosmic vibration&quot;, and James Brown Scott wrote that &quot;the one dream of our ages has been realised in our time&quot;. Much praise was heaped upon the appointment of an American judge despite the fact that the United States had not become a signatory to the court&#x27;s protocol, and it was thought that it would soon do so.

=== Increasing work ===

The court faced increasing work as it went on, allaying the fears of those commentators who had believed the court would become like the Supreme Court of the United States, which was not presented with a case for its first six terms. The court was given nine cases during 1922, however, with judgments called &quot;cases&quot; and advisory opinions called &quot;questions&quot;. Three cases were disposed of during the court&#x27;s first session, one during an extraordinary sitting between 8 January and 7 February 1923 (the Tunis-Morocco Nationality Question), four during the second ordinary sitting between 15 June 1923 and 15 September 1923 (Eastern Carelia Question, S.S. &quot;Wimbledon&quot; case, German Settlers Question, Acquisition of Polish Nationality Question) and one during a second extraordinary session from 12 November to 6 December 1923 (Jaworznia Question). A replacement for Ruy Barbosa (who had died on 1 March 1923 without hearing any cases) was also found, with the election of Epitácio Pessoa on 10 September 1923. The workload the following year was reduced, containing two judgments and one advisory opinion; the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions Case, the Interpretation of the Treaty of Neuilly Case (the first case of the court&#x27;s Chamber of Summary Procedure) and the Monastery of Saint-Naoum Question. During the same year, a new president and vice-president were elected, since they were mandated to serve for a term of three years. At the elections on 4 September 1924, André Weiss was again elected vice-president and Max Huber became the second president of the court. Judicial pensions were created at the same time, with a judge being given 1/30th of his annual pay for every year he had served once he had both retired and turned 65.

1925 was an exceedingly busy year for the court, which sat for 210 days, with four extraordinary sessions as well as the ordinary session, producing 3 judgments and 4 advisory opinions. The first judgment was given in the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations Case, the second (by the Court of Summary Procedure) was on the interpretation of the Interpretation of the Treaty of Neuilly Case, and the third in the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions Case. The 4 advisory opinions issued by the court were in the Polish Postal Service in Danzig Question, the Expulsion of the Ecumenical Patriarch Question, the Treaty of Lausanne Question and the German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia Question. 1926 saw reduced business, with only one ordinary session and one extraordinary session; it was, however, the first year that all 11 judges had been present to hear cases. The court heard two cases, providing one judgment and one advisory opinion; a second question on German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia, this time a judgment rather than an advisory opinion, and an advisory opinion on the International Labour Organization.

Despite the reduction of work in 1926, 1927 was another busy year, the court sitting continuously from 15 June to 16 December, handing down 4 orders, 4 judgments and 1 advisory opinion. The judgments were in the Belgium-China Case, the Case Concerning the Factory at Chorzow, the Lotus Case and a continuation of the Mavrommatis Jerusalem Concessions Case. 3 of the advisory opinions were on the Competence of the European Commission on the Danube, and the 4th was on the Jurisdiction of Danzig Courts. The 4 orders were on the German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia. This year saw another set of elections; on 6 December, with Dionisio Anzilotti elected president and André Weiss elected vice-president. Weiss died the following year, and John Bassett Moore resigned; Max Huber was elected vice-president on 12 September 1928 to succeed Weiss, while a second death (Lord Finlay) left the court increasingly understaffed. Replacements for Moore and Finlay were elected on 19 September 1929; Henri Fromageot and Cecil Hurst respectively.

After the second round of elections in September 1930, the court was reorganised. On 16 January 1931 Mineichirō Adachi was appointed president, and Gustavo Guerrero vice-president.

===United States never joins===
The United States never joined the World Court, primarily because enemies of the League of Nations in the Senate argued that the court was too closely linked to the League of Nations. The leading opponent was Senator William Borah, Republican of Idaho. The United States finally recognised the court&#x27;s jurisdiction, following a long and drawn out process. President Warren G. Harding had first suggested US involvement in 1923, and on 9 December 1929, three court protocols were signed. The U.S. demanded a veto over cases involving the U.S. but other nations rejected the idea.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt did not risk his political capital and gave only passive support even though a two-thirds vote of approval was needed in the Senate. A barrage of telegrams flooded Congress, inspired by attacks made by Charles Coughlin and others. The treaty failed by seven votes on January 29, 1935.

The United States finally accepted the court&#x27;s jurisdiction on 28 December 1935, but the treaty was never ratified, and the U.S. never joined. Francis Boyle attributes the failure to a strong isolationist element in the US Senate, arguing that the ineffectiveness shown by US nonparticipation in the court and other international institutions could be linked to the start of the Second World War.

=== Growing international tension and dissolution of the court ===
1933 was a busy year for the court, which cleared its 20th case (and &quot;greatest triumph&quot;); the Eastern Greenland Case. This period was marked by growing international tension, however, with Japan and Germany announcing their withdrawal from the League of Nations, to come into effect in 1935. That did not directly affect the court, since the protocol accepting court jurisdiction was separately ratified, but it influenced whether a nation would be willing to bring a case before it, as evidenced by Germany&#x27;s withdrawal from two pending cases. There were few cases in 1934 since the world&#x27;s governments were more concerned with the growing international tension. The court&#x27;s business continued to be small in 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, and 1939 although 1937 was marked by Monaco&#x27;s acceptance of the court protocol. The court&#x27;s judicial output in 1940 consisted entirely of a set of orders, completed in a meeting between 19 and 26 February, caused by the beginning of World War II, which left the court with &quot;uncertain prospects for the future&quot;. Following the German invasion of the Netherlands, the court was unable to meet although the registrar and president were afforded full diplomatic immunity. Informed that the situation would not be tolerated after diplomatic missions from other nations left The Hague on 16 July, the president and registrar left the Netherlands and moved to Switzerland, accompanied by their staff.

The court was unable to meet between 1941 and 1944, but the framework remained intact, and it soon became apparent that the court would be dissolved. In 1943, an international panel met to consider &quot;the question of the Permanent Court of International Justice&quot;, meeting from 20 March to 10 February 1944. The panel agreed that the name and functioning of the court should be preserved but for some future court rather than a continuation of the current one. Between 21 August and 7 October 1944, the Dumbarton Oaks Conference was held, which, among other things, created an international court attached to the United Nations, to succeed the Permanent Court of International Justice. As a result of these conferences and others, the judges of the Permanent Court of International Justice officially resigned in October 1945 and, via a resolution by the League of Nations on 18 April 1946, the court and the league both ceased to exist, being replaced by the International Court of Justice and the United Nations.

== Organisation ==
=== Judges ===
The court initially consisted of 11 judges and 4 deputy judges, recommended by member states of the League of Nations to the Secretary general of the League of Nations, who would put them before the Council and Assembly for election. The Council and Assembly were to bear in mind that the elected panel of judges was to represent every major legal tradition in the league, along with &quot;every major civilisation&quot;. Each member state was allowed to recommend 4 potential judges, with a maximum of 2 from its own nation. Judges were elected by a straight majority vote, held independently in the Council and Assembly. The judges served for a period of nine years, with their term limits all expiring at the same time, necessitating a completely new set of elections. The judges were independent and rid themselves of their nationality for the purposes of hearing cases, owing allegiance to no individual member state, but it was forbidden to have more than one judge from the same state. As a sign of their independence from national ties, judges were given full diplomatic immunity when engaged in court business. The only requirements for judges were &quot;high moral character&quot; and &quot;the qualifications required in their respective countries [for] the highest judicial offices&quot; or to be &quot;jurisconsults of recognized competence in international law&quot;.

The first panel was elected on 14 September 1921, with the 4 deputies being elected on the 16th. On the first vote, Rafael Altamira y Crevea of Spain, Dionisio Anzilotti of Italy, Bernard Loder of the Netherlands, Ruy Barbosa of Brazil, Yorozu Oda of Japan, André Weiss of France, Antonio Sánchez de Bustamante y Sirven of Cuba and Lord Finlay of the United Kingdom were elected by a majority vote of both the Council and Assembly on the first ballot taken. The second ballot elected John Bassett Moore of the United States, and the sixth Didrik Nyholm of Denmark and Max Huber of Switzerland. As the deputy judges, Wang Ch&#x27;ung-hui of China, Demetre Negulesco of Romania and Mihailo Jovanović of Yugoslavia were elected. The Assembly and Council disagreed on the fourth deputy judge, but Frederik Beichmann of Norway was eventually appointed. Deputy judges were only substitutes for absent judges and were not afforded a vote in altering court procedure or contributing at other times. As such, they were allowed to act as counsel in international cases where they were not sitting as judges.

In 1930, the number of judges was increased to 15, and a new set of elections were held. The election was held on 25 September 1930, with 14 candidates receiving a majority on the first ballot and a 15th, Francisco José Urrutia, receiving a majority on the second. The full court was Urrutia, Mineichiro Adachi, Rafael Altamira y Crevea, Dionisio Anzilotti, Bustamante, Willem van Eysinga, Henri Fromageot, José Gustavo Guerrero, Cecil Hurst, Edouard Rolin-Jaequemyns, Frank B. Kellogg, Negulesco, Michał Jan Rostworowski, Walther Schücking and Wang Ch&#x27;ung-hui.

Judges were paid 15,000 Dutch florins a year, with daily expenses of 50 florins to pay for living expenses, and an additional 45,000 florins for the president, who was required to live at The Hague. Travelling expenses were also provided, and a &quot;duty allowance&quot; of 100 florins was provided when the court was sitting, with 150 for the vice-president. This duty allowance was limited to 20,000 florins a year for the judges and 30,000 florins for the vice-president; as such, it provided for 200 days of court hearings, with no allowance provided if the court sat for longer. The deputy judges received no salary but, when called up for service, were provided with travel expenses, 50 florins a day for living expenses and 150 florins a day as a duty allowance.

=== Procedure ===
Under the Covenant of the League of Nations, all League members agreed that if there was a dispute between states they &quot;recognize to be suitable for submission to arbitration and which cannot be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy&quot;, the matter would be submitted to the court for arbitration, with suitable disputes being over the interpretation of an international treaty, a question on international law, the validity of facts, which, if true, would breach international obligations and the nature of any reparations to be made for breaching international obligations. The original statutes of the court provided that all 11 judges were required to sit in every case. There were three exceptions: when reviewing Labour Clauses from a peace treaty such as the Treaty of Versailles (which was done by a special chamber of 5 judges, appointed every 3 years), when reviewing cases on communications or transport arising from a peace treaty (which used a similar procedure) and when hearing summary procedure cases, which were reviewed by a panel of 3 judges.

To prevent the appearance of any bias in the court&#x27;s makeup, if there was a judge belonging to one member state on the panel and the other member state was not &quot;represented&quot;, they had the ability to select an &quot;ad hoc&quot; judge of their own nationality to hear the case. In a full court hearing, that increased the number to 12; in one of the 5-man chambers, the new judge took the place of one of the original 5. That did not apply to summary procedure cases. The &quot;ad hoc&quot; judge, selected by the member state, was expected to fulfil all the requirements of a normal judge; the president of the court had ultimate discretion over whether to authorise him to sit. The court was mandated to open on 15 June each year and continue until all cases were finished, with extraordinary sessions if required; by 1927, there were more extraordinary sessions than ordinary ones. The court&#x27;s business being conducted in English and French as official languages, and hearings were public unless it was otherwise specified.

After receiving files in a case calculated to lead to a judgment, the judges would exchange their views informally on the salient legal points of the case, and a time limit for producing a judgment would then be set. Then, each judge would write an anonymous summary containing his opinion; the opinions would be circulated among the court for 2 or 3 days before the president drafted a judgment containing a summary of those submitted by individual judges. The court would then agree on the decision that they wished to reach, along with the main points of argument they wished to use. Once this was done, a committee of four, including the president, the registrar and two judges elected by secret ballot, drafted a final judgment, which was then voted on by the entire court. Once a final judgment was set, it was given to the public and the press. Every judgment contained the reasons behind the decision and the judges assenting; dissenting judges were allowed to deliver their own judgment, with all judgments read in open court before the agents of the parties to the dispute. Judgments could not be revised except on the discovery of some fact unknown when the court sat but not if the fact was known but not discussed because of negligence.

The court also issued &quot;advisory opinions&quot;, which arose from Article 14 of the covenant creating the court, which provided, &quot;The Court may also give an advisory opinion upon any dispute referred to it by the Council or Assembly&quot;. Goodrich interprets that as indicating that the drafters intended a purely advisory capacity for the court, not a binding one. Manley Ottmer Hudson (who sat as a judge) said that an advisory opinion &quot;was what it purported to be. It is advisory. It is not in any sense a judgement... hence it is not in any way binding on any state&quot;, but Charles De Visscher argued that in certain situations, an advisory opinion could be binding on the League of Nations Council and, under certain circumstances, some states; M. Politis agreed, saying that the court&#x27;s advisory opinions were equivalent to a binding judgment. In 1927, the court appointed a committee to look at this issue, and it reported that &quot;where there are in fact contending parties, the difference between contentious cases and advisory cases is only nominal... so the view that advisory opinions are not binding is more theoretical than real&quot;. In practice, advisory opinions were usually followed, mostly due to the fear that if this &quot;revolutionary&quot; international court&#x27;s decisions were not followed, it would undermine its authority. The court retained the discretion to avoid giving an advisory opinion, which it used on occasion.

=== Registrar and registry ===
Other than the judges, the court also included a registrar and his secretariat, the registry. When the court met for its initial session, opened on 30 January 1922 to allow for the establishment of procedure and the appointment of court officials, the secretary-general of the League of Nations passed an emergency resolution through the Assembly, which designated an official of the league and his staff as the registrar and registry respectively, with the first registrar being Åke Hammarskjöld. The registrar, required to reside within The Hague, was initially tasked with drawing up a plan to create an efficient secretariat, using the smallest number of staff possible and costing as little as possible. As a result, he decided to have each member of the secretariat as the head of a particular department, so the numbers of actual employees could be increased or decreased as necessary without impacting on the actual registry. In 1927, the post of deputy-registrar was created, tasked with dealing with legal research for the court and answering all diplomatic correspondence received by the registry.

The first deputy-registrar was Paul Ruegger; after his resignation on 17 August 1928, Julio Lopez Olivan was selected to succeed him. Olivan resigned in 1931 to take over from Hammarskjöld as registrar, and was replaced by M. L. J. H. Jorstad.

The three principal officers of the registry, after the registrar and deputy-registrar, were the three editing secretaries. The first editing secretary, known as the drafting secretary, was tasked with drafting the court&#x27;s publications (including the Confidential Bulletin, a document exclusively received by judges of the court) and Sections D and E of the official journal, comprising the legislative clauses conferring jurisdiction on the court and the court&#x27;s Annual Report. The second editing secretary, known as the oral secretary, was mainly responsible for the oral interpretation and translation of the court&#x27;s discussions. For public hearings, he was assisted by interpreters, but for private meetings, only he, the registrar and the deputy-registrar were admitted. As a result of this duty, the oral secretary was also tasked with writing Section C of the official journal, which comprised the oral interpretations of court minutes, along with cases and questions put before the court. The third secretary, known as the written secretary, was tasked with the written translations of the court&#x27;s business, which were &quot;both numerous and voluminous&quot;. He was assisted in this by the other secretaries and by translators for languages not his own; all secretaries were expected to speak English and French fluently and to have working knowledge of German and Spanish.

The registry was split into several departments: the Archives, the Accounting and Establishment, the Printing Service and the Copying Department. The Archives included a distribution service for the court&#x27;s documents and the legal texts used by the court itself and was described as one of the most difficult departments to organise. The Accounting and Establishment Department dealt with the requests for and allocation of the court&#x27;s yearly budget, which was drawn up by the registrar, approved by the court and submitted to the League of Nations. The Printing Department, run from a single printing plant in Leiden, was created to allow the circulation of the court&#x27;s publishings. The Copying Department comprised shorthand, typing and copying services, and included secretaries for the registrar and judges, emergency reporters capable of taking notes down verbatim and copyists; the smallest of the departments, it comprised between 12 and 40 staff depending on the business of the court.

== Jurisdiction ==
The court&#x27;s jurisdiction was largely optional, but there were some situations in which they had &quot;compulsory jurisdiction&quot;, and states were required to refer cases to them. That came from three sources: the Optional Clause of the League of Nations, general international conventions and &quot;special bipartite international treaties&quot;. The Optional Clause was a clause attached to the protocol establishing the court and required all signatories to refer certain classes of dispute to the court, with compulsory judgments resulting. There were approximately 30 international conventions under which the court had similar jurisdiction, including the Treaty of Versailles, the Air Navigation Convention, the Treaty of St. Germain and all mandates signed by the League of Nations. It was also foreseen that there would be clauses inserted in bipartite international treaties, which would allow the referral of disputes to the court; that occurred, with such provisions found in treaties between Czechoslovakia and Austria, and between Czechoslovakia and Poland.

Throughout its existence, the court widened its jurisdiction as much as possible. Strictly speaking, the court&#x27;s jurisdiction was only for disputes between states, but it regularly accepted disputes that were between a state and an individual if a second state brought the individual&#x27;s case to the court. It argued that the second state assertsled its rights, and the cases therefore became one between two states.

The proviso that the court was for disputes that could not &quot;be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy&quot; never made it require evidence that diplomatic discussions had been attempted before bringing the case. In the Loan Cases, it asserted jurisdiction despite the fact that there was no alleged breach of international law, and it could not be shown that there was any international element to the claim. The court justified itself by saying that the Covenant of the League of Nations allowed it to have jurisdiction in cases over &quot;the existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of international obligations&quot; and argued that since the fact &quot;may be of any kind&quot;, it had jurisdiction if the dispute is one of municipal law. It had been long established that municipal law may be considered as a side point to a dispute over international law, but the Loan Cases discussed municipal law without the application of any international points.

<doc id="24961" wikidata="Q1076311" url="?curid=24961" title="Prince Albert (genital piercing)">
<text>The Prince Albert (PA) is a penis piercing which extends from the urethra to the underside of the glans. It is one of the most common male genital piercings. The related reverse Prince Albert piercing enters through the urethra and exits through a hole pierced in the top of the glans.

While some piercers may choose to avoid the nerve bundle that runs along the center of the frenulum altogether, others may choose otherwise. The piercing can be centred if the bearer is circumcised. Otherwise, the piercing must be done off-centre so that the surrounding skin can reposition itself.
==Procedure==
The piercer usually starts by pushing a metal or glass tube down the urethra, or using their fingers to hold the urethra open. The piercer then pushes the needle through the skin beside the frenulum, guiding it into the receiving tube. The chosen jewellery is pushed through the freshly made hole and secured in place depending on the jewellery used.

Despite expectations of pain, the Prince Albert piercing is frequently cited to be one of the less painful piercings.

==Healing and potential side effects==
The Prince Albert healing time can take from 4 weeks to 6 months. A fresh PA piercing may cause bleeding, swelling and inflammation. In rare cases, it can lead to local infections. Some men find that the dribble caused by the PA when urinating necessitates sitting down to urinate. With practice, some men can control the stream while standing.

Some PA wearers report it enhances sexual pleasure for both partners. However, others penetrated by males with this piercing report discomfort. PA rings can cause additional discomfort to female partners in cases when the penis comes into contact with the cervix. Sexual partners of those with piercings may experience complications during oral sex such as chipped teeth, choking, foreign bodies getting stuck between the partner&#x27;s teeth, and mucosal injury to receptive partners.

As with many piercings, there is a risk of the jewelry becoming caught on clothing and being pulled or torn out. Very large gauge or heavy jewelry can cause thinning of the tissue between the urethral opening and the healed fistula, resulting in accidental tearing or other complications with sexual experiences. Conversely, extremely thin jewelry can cause the same tearing in what is commonly referred to as the &quot;cheese cutter effect&quot;, either during sudden torsion or over a long period of wearing, especially if the thin jewelry bears any weight.

== Jewelry ==

Prince Albert piercings are typically pierced at either 12 or 10g (2 or 2.5mm) or up to 5mm (4g) or a safe maximum of 6mm (2g). They are often (gradually) stretched soon after, with jewelry within the 8g to 00g (3mm to 8mm) range being the most popular. One of the reasons not to perform the initial piercing at a small diameter (16g or 14g) or otherwise to immediately stretch it to 10g or 8g using a taper is to prevent the &#x27;cheese-cutter effect&#x27;, although personal preference and individual anatomy also play a role in these decisions.

Further stretching to sizes 0 or 00g (8 or 9mm) and larger is not fairly common. This may be due to a lack of jewellery options in the 1g (7mm) size, leaving a large jump between 2g (6mm) and 0g (8mm). If a sufficiently heavy barbell or ring is worn continuously, a mild form of &#x27;auto-stretching&#x27; can be observed. This means that stretching to a larger gauge is easier and might not require a taper.. While stretching, it&#x27;s critical that there is 12 mm of tissue between the piercing hole and urethra to avoid splitting of the urethra with complications.

While most wearers find that PAs are comfortable to wear and rarely remove them, even during sex, some individuals have found that extremely large or heavy jewelry is uncomfortable to wear for long periods or interferes with the sexual functioning of the penis.

Jewelry suitably worn in a Prince Albert piercing includes the circular barbell, curved barbell, captive bead, segment ring, and the prince&#x27;s wand. Curved barbells used for PA piercings are worn such that one ball sits on the lower side of the penis and the other ball sits at the urethral opening. This type of jewelry prevents discomfort that can come from larger jewelry moving around during daily wear.

== History and culture ==
The origin of this piercing is unknown. Genital piercings appeared in the &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; as a way of enhancing sexual pleasure.

In modern times, the Prince Albert piercing was popularized by Jim Ward in the early 1970s. In West Hollywood, Ward met Richard Simonton (aka Doug Malloy) and Fakir Musafar. Malloy published a pamphlet in which he concocted fanciful histories of genital piercings in particular. These apocryphal tales—which included the notion that Albert, the Prince Consort invented the piercing that shares his name in order to tame the appearance of his large penis in tight trousers—are widely circulated as urban legend. No historical proof of their veracity has been located independent of Malloy&#x27;s assertions.

Like many other male genital piercings, it had a history of practice in gay male subculture in the twentieth century. It became more prominently known when body piercing expanded in the late 1970s and was gradually embraced by popular culture.

<text>Paint Your Wagon is a Broadway musical comedy, with book and lyrics by Alan J. Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe. The story centers on a miner and his daughter and follows the lives and loves of the people in a mining camp in Gold Rush-era California. Popular songs from the show included &quot;Wand&#x27;rin&#x27; Star&quot;, &quot;I Talk to the Trees&quot;, and &quot;They Call the Wind Maria&quot;.

The musical ran on Broadway in 1951 and in the West End in 1953. In 1969, the film version, also titled &quot;Paint Your Wagon,&quot; was released. It had a highly revised plot and some new songs composed by Lerner and André Previn.

==Synopsis==
;Act I
In the California Wilderness in May 1853, a crusty old miner, Ben Rumson, is conducting a makeshift funeral for a friend. Meanwhile, his 16-year-old daughter Jennifer discovers gold dust. Ben claims the land, and prospectors start flocking to the brand new town of Rumson (&quot;I&#x27;m On My Way&quot;). Two months later Rumson has a population of 400, all of whom are men except for Jennifer. Prospector Jake Whippany is waiting to save enough money to send for Cherry and her Fandango girls (&quot;Rumson&quot;), while Jennifer senses the tension building in town (&quot;What&#x27;s Going On Here?&quot;). Julio Valveras, a handsome young miner forced to live and work outside of town because he is Mexican, comes to town with dirty laundry and runs into Jennifer, who volunteers to do his laundry. They also talk to each other (&quot;I Talk to the Trees&quot;). Steve Bulmarck and the other men ponder the lonely nomadic life they lead in the song &quot;They Call the Wind Maria&quot;.

Two months later the men want Ben to send Jennifer away, and he wishes her mother was still alive to help him (&quot;I Still See Elisa&quot;). Jennifer is in love with Julio (&quot;How Can I Wait?&quot;), and when Ben sees Jennifer dancing with Julio&#x27;s clothes, he decides to send her East on the next stage. Jacob Woodling, a Mormon man with two wives, Sarah and Elizabeth, arrives in Rumson where the men demand Jacob sell one of his wives. To his surprise, Ben finds himself wooing Elizabeth (&quot;In Between&quot;) and wins her for $800 (&quot;Whoop-Ti-Yay&quot;). Jennifer is disgusted by her father&#x27;s actions and runs away, telling Julio that she will be reunited with him in a year&#x27;s time (&quot;Cariño Mío”). Cherry and her Fandango girls arrive (&quot;There&#x27;s a Coach Comin&#x27; In&quot;). Julio learns his claim is running dry which means he has to move on to make a living and that he will not be there to greet Jennifer when she returns.

;Act II
A year later in October, the miners celebrate the high times in Rumson now that the Fandango girls are around (&quot;Hand Me Down That Can o&#x27; Beans&quot;). Edgar Crocker, a miner who has saved his money, falls for Elizabeth and she responds, although Ben does not notice since he thinks Raymond Janney is in love with her (he is). Another miner, Mike Mooney, tells Julio about a lake that has gold dust on the bottom and he considers looking for it (&quot;Another Autumn&quot;). Jennifer returns in December, having learned civilized ways back East (&quot;All for Him&quot;). Ben tells his daughter that he will soon be moving on since he was not meant to stay in one place for long (&quot;Wand&#x27;rin&#x27; Star&quot;). The next day as Cherry and the girls are packing to leave they tell her about Julio leaving to find the lake with a bottom of gold. Raymond Janney offers to buy Elizabeth from Ben for $3,000, but she runs off with Edgar Crocker.

Word comes of another strike 40 miles south of Rumson and the rest of the town packs up to leave except for Jennifer, who is waiting for Julio to return, and Ben, who suddenly realizes that Rumson is indeed his town. Late in April, Julio appears, a broken man. Ben welcomes him and Julio is amazed to see Jennifer is there. As they move toward each other, the wagons filled with people move on.

==Productions==
The musical had a pre-Broadway try-out at the Shubert Theater in Philadelphia opening on September 17, 1951. It opened on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre on November 12, 1951, and closed on July 19, 1952, after 289 performances. The production was directed by Daniel Mann, set design by Oliver Smith, costume design by Motley, lighting design by Peggy Clark, music for dances arranged by Trude Rittmann, with dances and musical ensembles by Agnes de Mille set to the orchestrations of Ted Royal.
It starred James Barton (as Ben Rumson), Olga San Juan (Jennifer Rumson), Tony Bavaar (Julio Valveras), Gemze de Lappe (Yvonne Sorel), James Mitchell (Pete Billings), Kay Medford (Cherry), and Marijane Maricle (Elizabeth Woodling). Burl Ives and Eddie Dowling later took over the role of Ben Rumson, and Ann Crowley was a replacement for Jennifer. De Mille later restaged the dances as a stand-alone ballet, &quot;Gold Rush&quot;.

The West End production opened on February 11, 1953 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre and ran for 477 performances. It starred real life father and daughter Bobby Howes and Sally Ann Howes. The Australian production opened on November 27, 1954 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Melbourne, with Alec Kellaway as Ben.

A new production, with a revised libretto by David Rambo, was premiered at the Brentwood Theatre, produced by the Geffen Playhouse in association with Christopher Allen, D. Constantine Conte, and Larry Spellman in Los Angeles, California, from November 23, 2004, to January 9, 2005. This new world premiere adaptation was directed by Gilbert Cates and choreographed by Kay Cole. Design team included musical director Steve Orich, who provided arrangements and orchestrations. The design team featured Daniel Ionazzi (scenic and lighting), David Kay Mickeleson (costume) and Phil Allen (sound). The cast included Thomas F. Wilson as Ben Rumson, Jessica Rush as his daughter Jennifer and Sharon Lawrence as Lily. One change from the original was &quot;They Call the Wind Maria&quot; staged as an ensemble number instead of a showcase solo.

A subsequent production was produced by the Pioneer Theatre Company in Salt Lake City, Utah and ran from September 28, 2007, through October 13, 2007. The director was Charles Morey and choreographer Patti D&#x27;Beck, with a cast of nearly 30.

The musical was presented in an Encores! staged concert production at New York City Center in March 2015. The production was directed by Marc Bruni, and starred Keith Carradine as Ben Rumson, Alexandra Socha as Jennifer and Justin Guarini as Julio Valveras.
==Reception==
In 2010, Steven Suskin wrote, &quot;The interwoven use of ballet that worked so well in the highlands was less effective on the prairies, and the subject matter was harsh and cold. In spite of the show&#x27;s failure, Loewe displayed ... an uncanny ability to write scores indigenous to the time and locale of the characters and plots.&quot;

<doc id="24965" wikidata="Q3277671" url="?curid=24965" title="Pacific Overtures">
<text>Pacific Overtures is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and a book by John Weidman, with &quot;additional material by&quot; Hugh Wheeler.

Set in nineteenth-century Japan, it tells the story of the country&#x27;s westernization starting in 1853, when American ships forcibly opened it to the rest of the world. The story is told from the point of view of the Japanese, and focuses in particular on the lives of two friends who are caught in the change.

Sondheim wrote the score in a quasi-Japanese style of parallel 4ths and no leading-tone. He did not use the pentatonic scale; the 4th degree of the major scale is represented from the opening number through the finale, as Sondheim found just five pitches too limiting. The music contrasts Japanese contemplation (&quot;There Is No Other Way&quot;) with Western ingenuousness (&quot;Please Hello&quot;) while over the course of the 127 years, Western harmonies, tonality and even lyrics are infused into the score. The score is generally considered to be one of Sondheim&#x27;s most ambitious and sophisticated efforts.

The original Broadway production of &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot; in 1976 was staged in Kabuki style, with men playing women&#x27;s parts and set changes made in full view of the audience by black-clad stagehands. It opened to mixed reviews and closed after six months, despite being nominated for ten Tony Awards.

Given its specific casting and production demands, &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot; remains one of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s least-performed musicals. The show is occasionally staged by opera companies. The cast requires an abundance of male Asian actors who must play male and female parts. As written, women join the ensemble for only half of the last song; all other principal female roles are played by men, as was traditional in Kabuki theatre. In the original production the five female cast members appeared throughout the show in small roles and as stagehands, and more recent productions, including the 2004 Broadway revival, did away with the device of men playing the majority of the women&#x27;s roles. 

The most recent revival in 2017 at Classic Stage Company, helmed by John Doyle and starring George Takei as The Reciter, featured a cast of only 10 people, 8 men and 2 women. This also featured a revised book by John Weidman that had a running time of 90 minutes (as compared to the previous 2 hour 30 minute original run time).

==Title==

The title of the work is drawn directly from text in a letter from Admiral Perry addressed to the Emperor dated July 7, 1853:

&quot;Many of the large ships-of-war destined to visit Japan have not yet arrived in these seas, though they are hourly expected; and the undersigned, as an evidence of his friendly intentions, has brought but four of the smaller ones, designing, should it become necessary, to return to Edo in the ensuing spring with a much larger force. But it is expected that the government of your imperial majesty will render such return unnecessary, by acceding at once to the very reasonable and &quot;pacific overtures&quot; contained in the President&#x27;s letter, and which will be further explained by the undersigned on the first fitting occasion.&quot;

In addition to playing on the musical term &quot;overture&quot; and the geographical reference to the Pacific Ocean there is also the irony, revealed as the story unfolds, that these &quot;pacific overtures&quot; to initiate commercial exploitation of the Pacific nation were backed by a none too subtle threat of force.

==Productions==
&quot;Pacific Overtures&quot; previewed in Boston and ran at The Kennedy Center for a month before opening on Broadway at the Winter Garden Theatre on January 11, 1976. It closed after 193 performances on June 27, 1976. Directed by Harold Prince, the choreography was by Patricia Birch, scenic design by Boris Aronson, costume design by Florence Klotz, and lighting design by Tharon Musser. The original cast recording was released originally by RCA Records and later on CD. This production was nominated for 10 Tony Awards, and won Best Scenic Design (Boris Aronson) and Best Costume Design (Florence Klotz). The original Broadway production was filmed and broadcast on Japanese television in 1976.

Mako later directed and reprised his role of the Reciter in a 1979 production at the East West Players in Los Angeles. The production featured multiple members of the original Broadway cast reprising their roles, including Sab Shimono, Ernest Harada, and Alvin Ing, with Soon-tek Oh taking on the role of Kayama. A young John Lone performed in the production as Commodore Perry. 
The musical was produced again by East West Players in 1998 as the inaugural performance at the David Henry Hwang Theater. East West Players staged Pacific Overtures for a third time in November 2024, led by Jon Jon Briones and Gedde Watanabe, who was part of the original Broadway production.

An off-Broadway production ran at the Promenade Theatre from October 25, 1984 for 109 performances, transferring from an earlier production at the York Theatre Company. Directed by Fran Soeder with choreography by Janet Watson, the cast featured Ernest Abuba and Kevin Gray.

The European premiere was directed by Howard Lloyd-Lewis (Library Theatre, Manchester) at Wythenshawe Forum in 1986 with choreography by Paul Kerryson who subsequently directed the show in 1993 at Leicester Haymarket Theatre. Both productions featured Mitch Sebastian in the role of Commodore Perry.

A production was mounted in London by the English National Opera in 1987. The production was recorded in its entirety on CD, preserving nearly the entire libretto as well as the score. Unlike previous productions, this production featured a cast consisting primarily of Caucasian actors and opera singers.

A critically acclaimed 2001 Chicago Shakespeare Theater production, directed by Gary Griffin, transferred to the West End Donmar Warehouse, where it ran from June 30, 2003 until September 6, 2003 and received the 2004 Olivier Award for Outstanding Musical Production.

In 2002 the New National Theatre of Tokyo presented two limited engagements of their production, which was performed in Japanese with English supertitles. The production ran at Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center from July 9, 2002 through July 13, and then at the Eisenhower Theater, Kennedy Center, from September 3, 2002, through September 8.

A Broadway revival by the Roundabout Theatre Company (an English-language mounting of the previous New National Theatre of Tokyo production) ran at Studio 54 from December 2, 2004, to January 30, 2005, directed by Amon Miyamoto and starring BD Wong as the Narrator and several members of the original cast. A new Broadway recording, with new (reduced) orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick was released by PS Classics, with additional material not included on the original cast album. The production was nominated for four Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical. The orchestrations were &quot;scaled back&quot; for a 7-piece orchestra. &quot;Variety&quot; noted that &quot;the heavy use of traditional lutes and percussion instruments like wood blocks, chimes and drums showcases the craftsmanship behind this distinctly Japanese-flavored score.&quot;

Classic Stage Company revived &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot; in 2017 for a limited Off-Broadway run, with a new abridged book by John Weidman, new orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick, directed by John Doyle, and starring George Takei as the Reciter. The production began previews April 6, 2017; after opening May 4, the show&#x27;s run was twice extended, eventually closing June 18. Staged in one act, with a 10-member cast in modern-dress, the production excised both &quot;Chrysanthemum Tea&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Lion Dance&quot;. The production earned recognition among the year&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; Critic&#x27;s Picks, the Top 5 NY Theater Productions in &quot;Variety&quot;, and Top 10 NY Theater Productions in &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot;. The show earned nominations from the Drama Desk, Drama League, Outer Critics Circle, and Lucille Lortel Awards.

In 2023 a new production debuted in Japan as a co-production between the Umeda Arts Theater in Osaka and the Menier Chocolate Factory in London. Directed by Matthew White, the production uses Sondheim and Weidman&#x27;s revisions from 2017. The production played March 8-29 at the Nissay Theatre in Tokyo, and then April 8-16 at the Umeda Arts Theater. The all-Japanese cast included Koji Yamamoto and Yuya Matsushita double cast as the Reciter, Eiji Wentz as Manjiro, and Hikaru Asami as the Shogun and Madam. The production, with a London-based cast including Takurō Ōno as Kayama and Masashi Fujimoto, played at the Menier Chocolate Factory from November 25, 2023 to February 24, 2024.

==Plot summary==
;Act I

Conceived as a Japanese playwright&#x27;s version of an American musical about American influences on Japan, &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot; opens in July 1853. Since the foreigners were expelled from the island empire, explains the Reciter, elsewhere wars are fought and machines are rumbling, but in Nippon they plant rice, exchange bows and enjoy peace and serenity, and there has been nothing to threaten the changeless cycle of their days (&quot;The Advantages of Floating in the Middle of the Sea&quot;). But President Millard Fillmore, determined to open up trade with Japan, has sent Commodore Matthew C. Perry across the Pacific.

To the consternation of Lord Abe and the Shogun&#x27;s other Councillors, the stirrings of trouble begin with the appearance of Manjiro, a fisherman who had been lost at sea and rescued by Americans. He has returned to Japan and now attempts to warn the authorities of the approaching warships, but is instead arrested for consorting with foreigners. A minor samurai, Kayama Yezaemon, is appointed Prefect of Police at Uraga to drive the Americans away - news which leaves his wife Tamate grief-stricken, since Kayama will certainly fail and both will then have to commit &quot;seppuku&quot;. As he leaves, she expresses her feelings in dance as two Observers describe the scene and sing her thoughts and words (&quot;There Is No Other Way&quot;). As a Fisherman, a Thief, and other locals relate the sight of the &quot;Four Black Dragons&quot; roaring through the sea, an extravagant Oriental caricature of the USS Powhatan pulls into harbor. Kayama is sent to meet with the Americans but he is laughed at and rejected as not being important enough. He enlists the aid of Manjiro, the only man in Japan who has dealt with Americans, and disguised as a great lord, Manjiro is able to get an answer from them: Commodore Perry must meet the Shogun within six days or else he will shell the city. Facing this ultimatum, the Shogun refuses to commit himself to an answer and takes to his bed. Exasperated by his indecision and procrastination, his Mother, with elaborate courtesy, poisons him. (&quot;Chrysanthemum Tea&quot;).

Kayama devises a plan by which the Americans can be received without technically setting foot on Japanese soil, thanks to a covering of tatami mats and a raised Treaty House, for which he is made Governor of Uraga. He and Manjiro set off for Uraga, forging a bond of friendship through the exchange of &quot;Poems&quot;. Kayama has saved Japan, but it is too late to save Tamate: when Kayama arrives at his home, he finds that she is dead, having committed &quot;seppuku&quot; after having received no news of Kayama for many days. Already events are moving beyond the control of the old order: the two men pass a Madam instructing her inexperienced Oiran girls in the art of seduction as they prepare for the arrival of the foreign devils (&quot;Welcome to Kanagawa&quot;).

Commodore Perry and his men disembark and, on their &quot;March to the Treaty House&quot;, demonstrate their goodwill by offering such gifts as two bags of Irish potatoes and a copy of Owen&#x27;s &quot;Geology of Minnesota&quot;. The negotiations themselves are observed through the memories of three who were there: a warrior hidden beneath the floor of the Treaty House who could hear the debates, a young boy who could see the action from his perch in the tree outside, and the boy as an old man recalling that without &quot;Someone In a Tree&quot;, a silent watcher, history is incomplete. Initially, it seems as if Kayama has won; the Americans depart in peace. But the barbarian figure of Commodore Perry leaps out to perform a traditional Kabuki &quot;Lion Dance&quot;, which ends as a strutting, triumphalist, all-American cakewalk.

;Act II

The child emperor (portrayed by a puppet manipulated by his advisors) reacts with pleasure to the departure of the Americans, promoting Lord Abe to Shogun, confirming Kayama as Governor of Uraga and raising Manjiro to the rank of Samurai. The crisis appears to have passed, but to the displeasure of Lord Abe the Americans return to request formal trading arrangements. To the tune of a Sousa march, an American ambassador bids &quot;Please Hello&quot; to Japan and is followed by a Gilbertian British ambassador, a clog-dancing Dutchman, a gloomy Russian and a dandified Frenchman all vying for access to Japan&#x27;s markets. With the appearance of this new group of westerners, the faction of the Lords of the South grow restless. They send a politically charged gift to the Emperor, a storyteller who tells a vivid, allegorical tale of a brave young emperor who frees himself from his cowardly Shogun.

Fifteen years pass as Kayama and Manjiro dress themselves for tea. As Manjiro continues to dress in traditional robes for the tea ceremony, Kayama gradually adopts the manners, culture and dress of the newcomers, proudly displaying a new pocket watch, cutaway coat and &quot;A Bowler Hat&quot;. Although Kayama, as stated in his reports to the Shogun, manages to reach an &quot;understanding&quot; with the Western merchants and diplomats, tensions abound between the Japanese and the &quot;barbarians&quot;. Three British sailors on shore leave mistake the daughter of a samurai for a geisha (&quot;Pretty Lady&quot;). Though their approach is initially gentle, they grow more persistent to the point where they offer her money; the girl cries for help and her father kills one of the confused sailors. Kayama and Abe travel to the Emperor&#x27;s court discussing the situation. While on the road, their party is attacked by cloaked assassins sent by the Lords of the South and Abe is assassinated. Kayama is horrified to discover that one of the assassins is his former friend, Manjiro; they fight and Kayama is killed.

In the ensuing turmoil, the puppet Emperor seizes real power and vows that Japan will modernize itself. As the country moves from one innovation to the &quot;Next!&quot;, the Imperial robes are removed layer by layer to show the Reciter in modern dress. Contemporary Japan - the country of Toyota, Seiko, air and water pollution and market domination - assembles itself around him and its accomplishments are extolled. &quot;Nippon. The Floating Kingdom. There was a time when foreigners were not welcome here. But that was long ago...&quot; says the Reciter. &quot;Welcome to Japan.&quot;

==Critical response and analysis==
&quot;Someone in a Tree&quot;, where two witnesses describe negotiations between the Japanese and Americans, was Sondheim&#x27;s favorite song out of everything he had written. &quot;A Bowler Hat&quot; presents the show&#x27;s theme, as a samurai gradually becomes more Westernized as he progressively adopts the habits and affectations of the foreigners he is meant to supervise. “Pretty Lady” is a contrapuntal trio of three British sailors who have mistaken a young girl for a geisha and are attempting to woo her. This is, perhaps, the musical fusion highlight of the show as the orchestra and lays descending parallel 4ths and the singers use a counterpoint form established during the Western Renaissance; again the chord progression is often IV to I, again eschewing Pentatonics.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; review of the original 1976 production said &quot;The lyrics are totally Western and—as is the custom with Mr. Sondheim—devilish, wittily and delightfully clever. Mr. Sondheim is the most remarkable man in the Broadway musical today—and here he shows it victoriously...Mr. Prince&#x27;s staging uses all the familiar Kabuki tricks—often with voices screeching in the air like lonely sea birds—and stylizations with screens and things, and stagehands all masked in black to make them invisible to the audience. Like choreography, the direction is designed to meld Kabuki with Western forms...the attempt is so bold and the achievement so fascinating, that its obvious faults demand to be overlooked. It tries to soar—sometimes it only floats, sometimes it actually sinks—but it tries to soar. And the music and lyrics are as pretty and as well-formed as a bonsai tree. &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot; is very, very different.&quot;

Walter Kerr&#x27;s article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on the original 1976 production said &quot;But no amount of performing, or of incidental charm, can salvage &#x27;Pacific Overtures.&#x27; The occasion is essentially dull and immobile because we are never properly placed in it, drawn neither East nor West, given no specific emotional or cultural bearings.&quot; Ruth Mitchell, assistant to Mr. Prince, said in an interview with WPIX that a sense of not belonging was intentional as that was the very point of the show.

Frank Rich, reviewing the 1984 revival for &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;the show attempts an ironic marriage of Broadway and Oriental idioms in its staging, its storytelling techniques and, most of all, in its haunting Stephen Sondheim songs. It&#x27;s a shotgun marriage, to be sure - with results that are variously sophisticated and simplistic, beautiful and vulgar. But if &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot; is never going to be anyone&#x27;s favorite Sondheim musical, it is a far more forceful and enjoyable evening at the Promenade than it was eight years ago at the Winter Garden...Many of the songs are brilliant, self-contained playlets. In &quot;Four Black Dragons&quot; various peasants describe the arrival of the American ships with escalating panic, until finally the nightmarish event does seem to be, as claimed, &quot;the end of the world.&quot;...&quot;Someone in a Tree,&quot; is a compact &quot;Rashomon&quot; - and as fine as anything Mr. Sondheim has written...The single Act II triumph, &quot;Bowler Hat,&quot; could well be a V. S. Naipaul tale set to music and illustrated with spare Japanese brushstrokes...&quot;Bowler Hat&quot; delivers the point of &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot; so artfully that the rest of Act II seems superfluous.&quot;

The 2004 production was not as well received. It was based on a critically praised Japanese language production by director Amon Miyamoto. Ben Brantley, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Now Mr. Miyamoto and &quot;Pacific Overtures&quot; have returned with an English-speaking, predominantly Asian-American cast, which makes distracting supertitles unnecessary. The show&#x27;s sets, costumes and governing concept remain more or less the same. Yet unlike the New National Theater of Tokyo production, which was remarkable for its conviction and cohesiveness, this latest incarnation from the Roundabout Theater Company has the bleary, disoriented quality of someone suffering from jet lag after a sleepless trans-Pacific flight. Something has definitely been lost in the retranslation.&quot; Of the cast, Brantley wrote, &quot;Even as they sing sweetly and smile engagingly, they appear to be asking themselves, &quot;What am I doing here?&quot;&quot;

<text>Paradoxical intention (PI) is a psychotherapeutic technique used to treat recursive anxiety by repeatedly rehearsing the anxiety-inducing pattern of thought or behaviour, often with exaggeration and humor. Paradoxical intention has been shown to be effective in treating psychosomatic illnesses such as chronic insomnia, public speaking phobias, etc. by making patients do the opposite of their hyper-intended goal, hindering their ability to perform the activity.

== The term ==
Dr. Viktor Frankl, the founder of Logotherapy, coined the term in 1939 and advocated for its use by patients with severe anxiety disorders. Though therapists had been utilizing paradoxical treatments for a long time before the term was coined. Later on paradoxical intention was incorporated into Logotherapy.

== Technique ==
Within the framework of Logotherapy, two techniques have been developed: &#x27;paradoxical intention&#x27; and &#x27;dereflection.&#x27;

Most anxious behaviours are a result of performance anxiety due to the inability to perform an action, leading to a vicious circle of anticipatory anxiety. Paradoxical intention teaches the patient to distance themselves from the action, gain control over it and eventually, bring about its removal. It attempts to break this circle by replacing the pathogenic fear with a paradoxical wish. Furthermore, by learning to appreciate the humour in their exaggerated responses, individuals observe the non-catastrophic consequences of their fear-inducing stimuli first-hand, accepting the unlikelihood of the feared anxiety-producing outcome occurring. Paradoxical intention is mainly employed to combat discomfort associated with internal causes while fear of external stimuli can still be treated through conventional treatments such as systematic desensitisation, cognitive behavioural therapy, etc. For example, if the patient has a fear of public speaking, paradoxical intention would be employed only if the feelings of apprehension stem from an internal source, e.g. having an increased heart rate leading to a heart attack and not due to external factors such as the size of the crowd, their judgement, etc. In this case, the therapist would prescribe the individual to present to the public while focusing on the most salient aspect of their fear – in this case, trying to increase heart rate.

=== For phobic and obsessive compulsion ===
=== For insomnia ===
Paradoxical intention has been shown as an effective therapy in the treatment of chronic insomnia. It attempts to eradicate the anxiety associated with the inability to sleep by instructing patients to do the opposite and attempt to stay awake. By asking patients to keep their eyes open, while lying comfortably in a dark room without sleeping, they are taught to understand the non-disastrous implications of staying awake and thus, the anxiety associated with it diminishes. Thereby in this manner, by eliminating voluntary sleep effort, paradoxical intention minimises sleep performance anxiety, promoting rapid sleep onset. Similarly, it is also suggested that by diverting attention from sleep performance, it allows for cognitive de-arousal leading to relaxation and sleep.

A study investigating the effects of paradoxical intention on sleep effort, sleep anxiety and objective and subjective sleep showed that relative to control conditions, participants allocated to PI displayed noteworthy reductions in sleep effort and sleep performance anxiety. It has also been found that subjectively measured sleep onset latency [SOL] (time taken to fall asleep) is significantly lower in the PI conditions, with SOL change amongst PI participants being strongly associated with sleep effort change. This shows that sleep effort and sleep anxiety are integral mechanisms overridden by PI to achieve normal sleep functions. A 1984 study analysing cases of paradoxical intention as a treatment showed that PI rapidly reduced SOLs and was also successful at maintaining sleep onset and maximising total sleep time.

A 2021 meta-analysis conducted a systematic review of randomised control trials and experimental studies comparing PI for insomnia to passive and active comparators. Results showed that relative to passive comparators, PI showed radical improvements in several key insomnia symptoms with moderate improvements as compared to active comparators. It also promoted decreased sleep-related performance anxiety. Additionally, a 2018 meta-analysis contrasted cognitive and behavioural interventions with passive comparators and when compared to recent relations between PI and passive comparators, it is found that the effects of PI on SOL are larger.

=== Recursive anxiety ===

Research has also configured links between the effectiveness of paradoxical intention as a treatment towards recursive anxiety. Patients whose phobias originate from recursive anxiety have shown greater improvement with PI related treatments. This occurs due to paradoxical intention overcoming performance anxiety and facilitating natural sleep, unlike situations where external factors e.g. noise, temperature, etc. affect sleeping ability. Recursive anxiety is also a result of the anticipatory fear that anxiety causes a lack of self-control leading to public embarrassment and judgement. Therefore, recursive anxiety leads to individuals attempting to control their cognitive environment by adjusting thoughts and behaviour to minimize stimuli inhibiting calmness.

== Dereflection ==
Dereflection is the technique of diverting the client&#x27;s attention away from their symptoms, as hyper-reflection can lead to inaction.

Dereflection has been developed for people with sexual disorders, in which the patient&#x27;s desire for sexual pleasure becomes an obstruction to achieving it. The therapist discourages intercourse and breaks the cycle of desire, striving, and disappointment.

== Criticisms ==

=== Relative effectiveness ===
The effectiveness of paradoxical intention as a substantial treatment for insomnia has been challenged. In fact, research indicates that stimulus control therapies and sleep restriction therapies have been proven to be more effective in treating insomnia.

The current understanding of paradoxical intention with regards to sleep states that it alleviates the patient&#x27;s “effort associated with sleep”. Espie and Lindsay argue that instead of eradicating the anxiety, it may simply be redirected towards the “effort to stay awake”. Espie says that since the objective of sleep therapy is to view sleep as an involuntary physiological process that occurs passively, trying to put it under voluntary control by instructing patients to deliberately stay awake could be counterintuitive.

=== Lack of reliable and objective research ===
Turner and Ascher say that paradoxical intention has not gained complete acceptance in behaviour therapy because the research supporting its clinical efficacy is mainly limited to uncontrolled case studies.

Some have argued that studies have also shown a lack of evidence directly gleaned from the clients in order to explain the effectiveness of PI approaches, rendering the data unreliable, and that the insomniac self-reports are unreliable as participants may provide socially desirable answers.

Thereby, paradoxical intention is viewed as a last case resort in the event of the ineffectiveness of other relaxation-desensitisation programs.

<text>Peter Stuyvesant ( – August 1672) was a Dutch colonial administrator who served as the director-general of New Netherland from 1647 to 1664, when the colony was provisionally ceded to the Kingdom of England. He was a major figure in the history of New York City and his name has been given to various landmarks and points of interest throughout the city (e.g. Stuyvesant High School, Stuyvesant Town, Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood, etc.).

Stuyvesant&#x27;s accomplishments as director-general of New Netherland included a great expansion for the settlement of New Amsterdam beyond the southern tip of Manhattan. Among the projects built by Stuyvesant&#x27;s administration were the protective wall on Wall Street, the canal that became Broad Street, and Broadway. Stuyvesant, himself a member of the Dutch Reformed Church, opposed religious pluralism and came into conflict with Lutherans, Jews, Roman Catholics, and Quakers as they attempted to build places of worship in the city and practice their faiths.
==Early life==
Peter Stuyvesant was born around 1610 in Peperga or Scherpenzeel, Friesland, in the Netherlands, to Balthasar Stuyvesant, a Reformed Calvinist minister, and Margaretha Hardenstein. He grew up in Peperga, Scherpenzeel, and Berlikum.

==Career==
At the age of 20, Stuyvesant went to the University of Franeker, where he studied languages and philosophy, but several years later he was expelled from the school after he seduced the daughter of his landlord. He was then sent to Amsterdam by his father, where Stuyvesant – now using the Latinized version of his first name, &quot;Petrus&quot;, to indicate that he had university schooling – joined the Dutch West India Company (GWC). In 1630, the company assigned him to be their commercial agent on a small island just off of Brazil, Fernando de Noronha, and then five years later transferred him to the nearby Brazilian state of Pernambuco. In 1638, he was moved again, this time to the colony of Curaçao, the main Dutch naval base in the West Indies, where, just four years later, aged 30, he became the acting governor of that colony, as well as Aruba and Bonaire, a position he held until 1644.

In April 1644, he coordinated and led an attack on the island of Saint Martin—which the Spanish had taken from the Dutch. Peter thought they had few men. When Peter raised the Dutch flag the Spanish fired. A cannonball hit Peter. They lost the battle and Peter had his lower leg amputated.

Stuyvesant returned to the Netherlands for convalescence, where his right leg was replaced with a wooden peg. Stuyvesant was given the nicknames &quot;Peg Leg Pete&quot; and &quot;Old Silver Nails&quot; because he used a wooden stick studded with silver nails as a prosthesis. The West India Company saw the loss of Stuyvesant&#x27;s leg as a &quot;Roman&quot; sacrifice, while Stuyvesant himself saw the fact that he did not die from his injury as a sign that God was saving him to do great things. A year later, in May 1645, he was selected by the company to replace Willem Kieft as Director-General of the New Netherland colony, including New Amsterdam, the site of present-day New York City.

===New Netherland===
Stuyvesant had to wait for his appointment to be confirmed by the Dutch States-General. During that time he married Judith Bayard, who was the daughter of a Huguenot minister and hailed from Breda. Together, they left Amsterdam in December 1646 and, after stopping at Curaçao, arrived in New Amsterdam by May 1647.

Kieft&#x27;s administration of the colony had left the colony in terrible condition. Only a small number of villages remained after Kieft&#x27;s wars, and many of their inhabitants had been driven away and returned home, leaving only 250 to 300 men able to carry arms. Kieft himself had accumulated a fortune of over 4,000 guilders during his term in office, and become an alcoholic.

Certain that righting New Netherland was the work which God had saved him for, Stuyvesant told its people &quot;I shall govern you as a father his children,&quot; and began the task of rebuilding the physical and moral state of the colony.

In September 1647 he appointed the Nine Men, an advisory council composed of representatives of the colonists, to help rebuild relationships with them, temper his rule with their guidance, and restore New Netherland to the kind of well-run place that the Dutch preferred.

In 1648 a conflict began between him and Brant Aertzsz van Slechtenhorst, the commissary of the patroonship Rensselaerwijck, which surrounded Fort Orange (present-day Albany). Stuyvesant claimed he had power over Rensselaerwijck, despite special privileges granted to Kiliaen van Rensselaer in the patroonship regulations of 1629. When Van Slechtenhorst refused, Stuyvesant sent a group of soldiers to enforce his orders. The controversy that followed resulted in the founding of the new settlement, Beverwijck.
In an effort to remedy the neglect on the town, previously under Kieft&#x27;s administration, Stuyvesant took measures to improve the appearance and safety of the town, with numerous regulations to achieve this end that were routinely issued by his office. Building codes were established for houses and other structures, including fences in an effort to control the widespread problem of wandering livestock about the town. As the housing and other structures in New Amsterdam were built almost entirely from wood and stood very close together the possibility of a spreading fire was very great. As governor, Stuyvensant forbid the construction of wooden chimneys, and imposed a tax of a beaver skin, or its trade equivalent, on every householder to finance the cost of two hundred and fifty leather fire buckets and hooks and ladders, which he had sent from Holland. He also established a system of fire wardens and a volunteer fire watch that patrolled the streets to keep an eye on any fire, or potential fire, from nine o&#x27;clock in the evening until the morning drum-beat. As such Stuyvesant became the organizer and head of the first volunteer firemen in America
===External threats===

The colony of New Netherland had severe external problems. The population was too small and contentious, and the Company provided little military support. The most serious was the economic rivalry with England regarding trade. Secondarily there were small scale military conflicts with neighboring Indian tribes, involving fights between mobile bands on the one hand, and scattered small Dutch outposts on the other. With a large area and limited population, defense was a major challenge. Stuyvesant&#x27;s greatest success came in dealing with the Delaware River colony of New Sweden, which he invaded and annexed in 1655. Relations with the English Connecticut Colony were strained, with disputes over ownership of land in the Connecticut valley, and in eastern Long island. The treaty of Hartford of 1650 was advantageous to the English, as Stuyvesant gave up claims to the Connecticut Valley while gaining only a small portion of Long island. In any case, Connecticut settlers ignored the treaty and steadily poured into the Hudson Valley, where they agitated against Stuyvesant. In 1664, England sent an expeditionary force to capture New Netherland. The colony&#x27;s settlers refused to fight, forcing Stuyvesant to surrender and demonstrating the dilemma of domestic dissatisfaction, small size, and overwhelming external pressures with inadequate military support from the Company that was fixated on profits.

===Expansion of the colony===
Stuyvesant became involved in a dispute with Theophilus Eaton, the governor of English New Haven Colony, over the border of the two colonies. In September 1650, a meeting of the commissioners on boundaries took place in Hartford, Connecticut, called the Treaty of Hartford, to settle the border between New Amsterdam and the English colonies to the north and east. The border was arranged to the dissatisfaction of the Nine Men, who declared that &quot;the governor had ceded away enough territory to found fifty colonies each fifty miles square.&quot; Stuyvesant then threatened to dissolve the council. A new plan of municipal government was arranged in the Netherlands, and the name &quot;New Amsterdam&quot; was officially declared on 2 February 1653. Stuyvesant made a speech for the occasion, saying that his authority would remain undiminished.

Stuyvesant was then ordered to the Netherlands, but the order was soon revoked under pressure from the States of Holland and the city of Amsterdam. Stuyvesant prepared against an attack by ordering the citizens to dig a ditch from the North River to the East River and to erect a fortification.

In 1653, a convention of two deputies from each village in New Netherland demanded reforms, and Stuyvesant commanded that assembly to disperse, saying: &quot;We derive our authority from God and the company, not from a few ignorant subjects.&quot;

In 1654, Stuyvesant signed a deed for an allotment of land that corresponds to the modern-day Financial District of lower Manhattan. It was co-signed by land grantee and secretary of the New Netherland Council Cornelis van Ruijven (alternative spelling Ruyven). The lot was given and granted to van Ruijven. The deed conveys a tract of land on Manhattan island in the Sheep Pasture. It was bounded by present-day Broad Street to William Street, and Beaver Street to Exchange Place.

In the summer of 1655, he sailed down to the Delaware River with a fleet of seven vessels and about 300 men and took possession of the colony of New Sweden, which was renamed &quot;New Amstel.&quot; In his absence, Pavonia and Staten Island were attacked by Native Americans on 15 September 1655 in what became known as the Peach War. In 1660, Stuyvesant was quoted as saying that &quot;Nothing is of greater importance than the early instruction of youth.&quot; In 1661, New Amsterdam had one grammar school, two free elementary schools, and had licensed 28 schoolmasters.

As director-general of New Netherland, Stuyvesant greatly increased the colony&#x27;s involvement with slavery. During the late 1640s, authorities in the neighboring English colonies of Connecticut and Maryland encouraged New Netherland slaves to escape there, refusing to return them. In 1650, Stuyvesant threatened to offer freedom to Maryland slaves unless the colony stopped sheltering runaways from New Netherland. In 1657, the GWC&#x27;s directors wrote to Stuyvesant, telling him that they were not going to be able to send him all the tradesmen that he requested and that he would have to use slaves as well. Although it is commonly thought that Stuyvesant was New Netherland&#x27;s largest slaveholder, he only owned two slaves, purchasing them as part of the farm he bought from the GWC in 1651.


===Religious freedom===

Stuyvesant did not tolerate full religious freedom in the colony, and was strongly committed to the supremacy of the Dutch Reformed Church. In 1657 he refused Lutherans the right to organize a church. When he also issued an ordinance forbidding them from worshiping in their own homes, the directors of the GWC, three of whom were Lutherans, told him to rescind the order and allow private gatherings of Lutherans. The Company position was that more tolerance led to more trade and benefited everyone.

Freedom of religion was further tested when Stuyvesant refused to allow the permanent settlement of Jewish refugees from Dutch Brazil in New Amsterdam (without passports), and join the handful of existing Jewish traders (with passports from Amsterdam). Stuyvesant attempted to have Jews leave the colony &quot;in a friendly way&quot;. As he wrote to the Amsterdam Chamber of the GWC in 1654, he hoped that &quot;the deceitful race, — such hateful enemies and blasphemers of the name of Christ, — be not allowed to further infect and trouble this new colony.&quot; He referred to Jews as a &quot;deceitful race&quot; and &quot;usurers&quot;, and was concerned that &quot;Jewish settlers should not be granted the same liberties enjoyed by Jews in Holland, lest members of other persecuted minority groups, such as Roman Catholics, be attracted to the colony.&quot;

Stuyvesant&#x27;s decision was again rescinded after pressure from the directors of the company. As a result, Jewish immigrants were allowed to stay in the colony as long as their community was self-supporting. However, Stuyvesant would not allow them to build a synagogue, forcing them to worship instead in a private house.

In 1657, the Quakers, who were newly arrived in the colony, drew his attention. He ordered the public torture of Robert Hodgson, a 23-year-old Quaker convert who had become an influential preacher. Stuyvesant then made an ordinance, punishable by fine and imprisonment, against anyone found guilty of harboring Quakers. That action led to a protest from the citizens of Flushing, which came to be known as the Flushing Remonstrance, considered by some historians to be a precursor to the United States Constitution&#x27;s provision on freedom of religion in the Bill of Rights.

===Capitulation===

In 1664, King Charles II of England ceded to his brother, the Duke of York, later King James II, a large tract of land that included all of New Netherland. This came at a period of considerable conflict between England and the Netherlands in the Anglo-Dutch Wars. Four English ships bearing 450 men, commanded by Richard Nicolls, seized the Dutch colony. On 30 August 1664, George Cartwright sent the governor a letter demanding surrender. He promised &quot;life, estate, and liberty to all who would submit to the king&#x27;s authority.&quot;

On 6 September 1664, Stuyvesant sent Johannes de Decker, a lawyer for the West India Company, and five others to sign the Articles of Capitulation. Nicolls was declared governor, and the city was renamed New York. Stuyvesant obtained civil rights and freedom of religion in the Articles of Capitulation. The Dutch settlers mainly belonged to the Dutch Reformed church, a Calvinist denomination, holding to the Three Forms of Unity (Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dordt). The English were Anglicans, holding to the 39 Articles, a Protestant confession, with bishops.

In 1665, Stuyvesant went to the Netherlands to report on his term as governor. On his return to the colony, he spent the remainder of his life on his farm, Stuyvesant Farm, of sixty-two acres outside the city, called the Great Bouwerie, beyond which stretched the woods and swamps of the village of Nieuw Haarlem. A pear tree that he reputedly brought from the Netherlands in 1647 remained at the corner of Thirteenth Street and Third Avenue until 1867 when it was destroyed by a storm, bearing fruit almost to the last. The house was destroyed by fire in 1777. He also built an executive mansion of stone called Whitehall.

==Personal life==
In 1645, Stuyvesant married Judith Bayard (–1687) of the Bayard family. Her brother, Samuel Bayard, was the husband of Stuyvesant&#x27;s sister, Anna Stuyvesant. Petrus and Judith had two sons together:

* Balthasar Lazarus Stuyvesant (1647–1678), who settled in the West Indies and married Maria Lucas Raapzaat
* Nicolaes Willem Stuyvesant (1648–1698), who first married Maria Beekman (1650–1679), daughter of Wilhelmus Beekman, and after her death, Elisabeth Slechtenhorst.

He died in August 1672 and his body was entombed in the east wall of St. Mark&#x27;s Church in-the-Bowery, which sits on the site of Stuyvesant&#x27;s family chapel.

===Descendants===


The last acknowledged descendant of Peter Stuyvesant to bear his surname was Augustus van Horne Stuyvesant Jr., who died a bachelor in 1953 at the age of 83 in his mansion at 2 East 79th Street. Rutherfurd Stuyvesant, the 19th-century New York developer, and his descendants are also descended from Peter Stuyvesant; however, Rutherford Stuyvesant&#x27;s name was changed from Stuyvesant Rutherford in 1863 to satisfy the terms of the 1847 will of Peter Gerard Stuyvesant.

His descendants include:
* Hamilton Fish (1808–1893), the 16th governor of New York, a United States senator and United States Secretary of State
* John Winthrop Chanler (1826–1877), a lawyer and a U.S. Representative from New York
* Stuyvesant Fish Morris (1843–1928), a prominent physician.
* Stuyvesant Fish (1851–1923), a president of the Illinois Central Railroad who was prominent in the U.S. Gilded Age
* Lewis Stuyvesant Chanler (1869–1942), a lieutenant governor of New York
* Edith Stuyvesant Gerry (1873–1958), an American philanthropist who was married to George Washington Vanderbilt II and Peter Goelet Gerry
* Loudon Wainwright Jr. (1924–1988), an American writer
* John Smith (1931–1995), the American actor who starred in two NBC western television series &quot;Cimarron City&quot;, is a descendant.
* Loudon Wainwright III (b. 1946), the American singer-songwriter is a descendant through his great-great-grandfather John Howard Wainwright, who married Margaret Stuyvesant.
* Peter Robinson (Robin) Fish (b. 1969), deputy head at Robert Gordon&#x27;s College
* Chase Coleman III (b.1975), hedge fund manager, Tiger Global Management

==Legacy==

According to historian Eleanor Bruchey:
:Peter Stuyvesant was essentially a difficult man thrust into a difficult position. Quick tempered, self-confident, and authoritarian, he was determined...to rule firmly and to repair the fortunes of the company. The company, however, had run the colony solely for trade profits, with scant attention to encouraging immigration and developing local government. Stuyvesant&#x27;s predecessors...had been dishonest or, at best, inept, so there was no tradition of respect and support for the governorship on which he could build. Furthermore, the colonists were vocal and quick to challenge authority...Throughout his administration there were constant complaints to the company of his tyrannical acts and pressure for more local self-government...His religious intolerance also exacerbated relations with the colonists, most of whom did not share his narrow outlook.

Stuyvesant and his family were large landowners in the northeastern portion of New Amsterdam, and the Stuyvesant name is currently associated with several places in Manhattan&#x27;s East Side, near present-day Gramercy Park: the Stuyvesant Town housing complex; the site of the original Stuyvesant High School, still marked Stuyvesant on its front face, on East 15th Street near First Avenue; Stuyvesant Cove Park and Stuyvesant Square, public parks in the area; the Stuyvesant Apartments on East 18th Street; and Stuyvesant Street, a thoroughfare in the East Village. The new Stuyvesant High, a premier public high school, is on Chambers Street near the World Trade Center. His farm, called the &quot;Bouwerij&quot; – the seventeenth-century Dutch word for &quot;farm&quot; – was the source for the name of the Manhattan street and surrounding neighborhood named &quot;The Bowery&quot;. The contemporary neighborhood of Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn includes Stuyvesant Heights and retains its name. Also named after him are the hamlets of Stuyvesant and Stuyvesant Falls in Columbia County, New York, where descendants of the early Dutch settlers still live and where the Dutch Reformed Church remains an important part of the community, as well as shopping centers, yacht clubs and other buildings and facilities throughout the area where the Dutch colony once was.

The &quot;Peter Stuyvesant Monument&quot; by J. Massey Rhind situated at Bergen Square in Jersey City was dedicated in 1915 to mark the 250th anniversary of the Dutch settlement there

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

<doc id="24969" wikidata="Q921267" url="?curid=24969" title="Phish">
<text>Phish is an American rock band formed in Burlington, Vermont, in 1983. The band consists of guitarist Trey Anastasio, bassist Mike Gordon, drummer Jon Fishman, and keyboardist Page McConnell, all of whom perform vocals, with Anastasio being the lead vocalist. The band is known for their musical improvisation and jams during their concert performances and for their devoted fan following.

The band was formed by Anastasio, Gordon, Fishman and guitarist Jeff Holdsworth, who were joined by McConnell in 1985. Holdsworth departed the band in 1986, and the lineup has remained stable since. Most of the band&#x27;s songs are co-written by Anastasio and lyricist Tom Marshall. Phish began to perform outside of New England in the late 1980s and experienced a rise in popularity in the mid 1990s. In October 2000, the band began a two-year hiatus that ended in December 2002, but they disbanded again in August 2004. Phish reunited officially in October 2008 for subsequent reunion shows in March 2009 and since then have resumed performing regularly. All four members pursued solo careers or performed with side-projects and these projects have continued even after the band has reunited.

Phish&#x27;s music blends elements of a wide variety of genres including funk, reggae, progressive rock, psychedelic rock, folk, country, jazz, blues, bluegrass, electronic music, and pop. The band is part of a movement of improvisational rock groups, inspired by the format of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s live performances and colloquially known as &quot;jam bands&quot;, that gained considerable popularity as touring concert acts in the 1990s. Phish has developed a large and dedicated following by word of mouth, the exchange of live recordings, and selling over 8 million albums and DVDs in the United States.

Phish were signed to major label Elektra Records from 1991 to 2005, when the band formed their own independent label, JEMP Records, to release archival CD and DVD sets.

==History==
===Formation, &quot;The White Tape&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday&quot;: 1983–1988===
Phish was formed at the University of Vermont (UVM) in 1983 by guitarists Trey Anastasio and Jeff Holdsworth, bassist Mike Gordon, and drummer Jon Fishman. Anastasio and Fishman had met that October, after Anastasio overheard Fishman playing drums in his dormitory room, and asked if he and Holdsworth could jam with him. Gordon met the trio shortly thereafter, having answered a want-ad for a bass guitarist that Anastasio had posted around the university.

The new group performed their first concert at Harris Millis Cafeteria at the University of Vermont on December 2, 1983, where they played a set of classic rock covers, including two songs by the Grateful Dead. The band performed one more concert in 1983, and then did not perform again for nearly a year, stemming from Anastasio&#x27;s suspension from the university following a prank he had pulled with a friend.

Anastasio returned to his hometown of Princeton, New Jersey following the prank, and reconnected with his childhood friend Tom Marshall; The duo began a songwriting collaboration and recorded material that would appear on the &quot;Bivouac Jaun&quot; demo tape. Marshall and Anastasio have subsequently composed the majority of Phish&#x27;s original songs throughout their career. Anastasio returned to Burlington in late 1984, and resumed performing with Gordon, Holdsworth and Fishman. The quartet named themselves Phish in October 1984, shortly before they performed their first concert together following Anastasio&#x27;s return to UVM. Anastasio designed the band&#x27;s logo, which featured the group&#x27;s name inside a stylized fish. The band&#x27;s members have given several different origins for the name Phish. In Parke Puterbaugh&#x27;s 2009 book &quot;Phish: The Biography&quot;, the origin is given as a variation on &quot;phshhhh&quot;, an onomatopoeia of the sound of a brush on a snare drum. In the 2004 official documentary &quot;Specimens of Beauty&quot;, Anastasio said the band was also named after Fishman, whose nickname is &quot;Fish.&quot; In a 1996 interview, Fishman denied that the band was named after him, and said the onomatopoeic inspiration behind the name was the sound of an airplane taking off.

In late 1984, Phish began to play regularly at Nectar&#x27;s bar and restaurant in downtown Burlington, and performed dozens of concerts across multiple residencies through March 1989. The band&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;A Picture of Nectar&quot; was named in honor of the bar&#x27;s owner, Nector Rorris, and its cover features his face superimposed onto an orange.

The band would collaborate with percussionist Marc Daubert, a friend of Anastasio&#x27;s, in the fall of 1984. Daubert ceased performing with the band in early 1985. Keyboardist Page McConnell met Phish in early 1985, when he arranged for them to play a spring concert at Goddard College, the small university he attended in Plainfield, Vermont. He began performing with the band as a guest shortly thereafter, and made his live debut during the third set of their May 3, 1985 concert at UVM&#x27;s Redstone Campus. In the summer of 1985, Phish went on a short hiatus while Anastasio and Fishman vacationed in Europe; during this time, McConnell offered to join the band permanently, and moved to Burlington to learn their repertoire from Gordon. McConnell officially joined Phish as a full-time band member in September 1985.

Phish performed with a five-piece lineup for about six months after McConnell joined, a period which ended when Holdsworth quit the group in March 1986 following a religious conversion. Anastasio and Fishman relocated in mid-1986 to Goddard College after a recommendation from McConnell. Phish distributed at least six experimental self-titled cassettes during this era, including &quot;The White Tape&quot;.

While based at Goddard College, Phish began to collaborate with fellow students Richard &quot;Nancy&quot; Wright and Jim Pollock. Pollock and Wright were musical collaborators who made experimental recordings on multi-track cassettes, and had been introduced to Phish through McConnell, who co-hosted a radio program on WGDR with Pollock. Phish adopted a number of Nancy&#x27;s songs into their own set, including &quot;Halley&#x27;s Comet&quot;, &quot;I Didn&#x27;t Know&quot;, and &quot;Dear Mrs. Reagan&quot;, the latter song being written by Nancy and Pollock. In his book &quot;Heads: A Biography of Psychedelic America&quot;, music journalist Jesse Jarnow observed that Wright and his music were highly influential to Phish&#x27;s early style and experimental sound. Wright amicably ended his association with Phish in 1989, but Pollock has continued to collaborate with Phish over the years, designing some of their album covers and concert posters.

By 1985, the group had encountered Burlington luthier Paul Languedoc, who would eventually design custom instruments for Anastasio and Gordon. In October 1986, he began working as their sound engineer. Since then, Languedoc has built exclusively for the two, and his designs and traditional wood choices have given Phish a unique instrumental identity. 

As his senior project for Goddard College, Anastasio penned &quot;The Man Who Stepped into Yesterday&quot;, a nine-song progressive rock concept album that would become Phish&#x27;s second studio experiment. Recorded between 1987 and 1988, it was submitted in July of that year, accompanied by a written thesis. The song cycle that developed from the project – known as Gamehendge – grew to include an additional eight songs. The band performed the suite in concert on six occasions: in 1988, 1991, 1993, twice in 1994, and in 2023, without replicating the song list. &quot;The Man Who Stepped Into Yesterday&quot; has never received an official release, but a bootleg tape has circulated for decades, and songs such as &quot;Wilson&quot; and &quot;The Lizards&quot; remain concert staples for the band.

Beginning in the spring of 1988, members of the band began practicing in earnest, sometimes locking themselves in a room and jamming for hours on end. One such jam took place at Anastasio&#x27;s apartment, with a second at Paul Languedoc&#x27;s house in August 1989. They called these jam sessions &quot;Oh Kee Pa Ceremonies&quot;, a reference to the film &quot;A Man Called Horse&quot;. In July 1988, the band performed their first concerts outside of the northeastern United States, when they embarked on a seven-date tour in Colorado. These shows are excerpted on their 2006 live compilation &quot;Colorado &#x27;88&quot;.

===&quot;Junta&quot;, &quot;Lawn Boy&quot;, and &quot;A Picture of Nectar&quot;: 1989–1992===
On January 26, 1989, Phish played the Paradise Rock Club in Boston; the owners of the club had never heard of Phish and refused to book them, so the band rented the club for the night. The show sold out due to the caravan of fans that had traveled to see the band. The concert was Phish&#x27;s breakthrough on the northeastern regional music circuit, and the band began to book concerts at other large rock clubs, theaters, and small auditoriums throughout the area, such as the Somerville Theatre, Worcester Memorial Auditorium and Wetlands Preserve. That spring, the band self-released their debut full-length studio album, &quot;Junta&quot;, and sold copies on cassette tape at their concerts. The album includes a studio recording of the epic &quot;You Enjoy Myself&quot;, which is considered to be the band&#x27;s signature song. Later in 1989, the band hired Chris Kuroda as their lighting director. Kuroda subsequently became well known for his artistic light shows at the group&#x27;s concerts. A profile on Phish appeared in the October 1989 issue of the Deadhead magazine &quot;Relix&quot;, which marked the first time the band had been covered in a major national music periodical.

By late 1990, Phish&#x27;s concerts were becoming more and more intricate, often making a consistent effort to involve the audience in the performance. In a special &quot;secret language&quot;, the audience would react in a certain manner based on a particular musical cue from the band. For instance, if Anastasio &quot;teased&quot; a motif from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; theme song, the audience would yell, &quot;D&#x27;oh!&quot; in imitation of . In 1992, Phish introduced a collaboration between audience and band called the &quot;Big Ball Jam&quot; in which each band member would throw a large beach ball into the audience and play a note each time his ball was hit. In so doing, the audience was helping to create an original composition. On occasion, performances of &quot;You Enjoy Myself&quot; and &quot;Mike&#x27;s Song&quot; involved Gordon and Anastasio performing synchronized maneuvers and jumping on mini-trampolines while simultaneously playing their instruments. Fishman would also regularly step out from behind his drum kit during concerts to sing cover songs, which were often punctuated by him playing an Electrolux vacuum cleaner like an instrument. The band released their second album, &quot;Lawn Boy&quot;, in September 1990 on Absolute A Go Go, a small independent label that had a distribution deal with the larger Rough Trade Records. The album had been recorded the previous year, after the band had won studio time at engineer Dan Archer&#x27;s Archer Studios when they came in first place at an April 1989 battle of the bands competition in Burlington.

Phish, along with Bob Dylan, the Grateful Dead, and the Beatles, was one of the first bands to have a Usenet newsgroup, rec.music.phish, which launched in 1992. Aware of the band&#x27;s growing popularity, Elektra Records signed them that year after they were recommended to the record label by A&amp;R representative Sue Drew. In the summer of 1991, the band embarked on a 14-date tour of the eastern United States accompanied by a three-piece horn section dubbed the Giant Country Horns. In August of that year, Phish played an outdoor concert at their friend Amy Skelton&#x27;s horse farm in Auburn, Maine that acted as a prototype for their later all-day festival events.

In 1992, the band released their third studio album, &quot;A Picture of Nectar&quot;, their first release for the major label Elektra. Subsequently, the label also reissued the band&#x27;s first two albums. Later in 1992, Phish participated in the first annual H.O.R.D.E. festival, which provided them with their first national tour of major amphitheaters. The lineup, among others, included Phish, Blues Traveler, the Spin Doctors, and Widespread Panic. That summer, the band toured Europe with the Violent Femmes and later toured Europe and the U.S. with Santana. Throughout the latter tour, Carlos Santana regularly invited some or all of the members of Phish to jam with his band during their headlining performances. The band ended 1992 with a New Year&#x27;s Eve performance at the Matthews Arena in Boston, Massachusetts, a performance that was simulcast throughout the Boston area by radio station WBCN. The concert was filled with several new &quot;secret language&quot; cues they had taught their audience in order to deliberately confuse radio listeners.

===&quot;Rift&quot;, &quot;Hoist&quot;, and &quot;A Live One&quot;: 1993–1995===
Phish began headlining major amphitheaters in the summer of 1993. That year, the group released their fourth album, &quot;Rift&quot;, a concept album which featured a cover painted by David Welker that referenced almost all of the songs on the record. The album was the band&#x27;s first to appear on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; album chart, debuting at #51 in February 1993.

In March 1994, the band released their fifth studio album &quot;Hoist.&quot; The album featured an array of guest performers, including country singer Alison Krauss, banjoist Béla Fleck, former Sly &amp; The Family Stone member Rose Stone, actor and trombonist Jonathan Frakes, and the horn section of R&amp;B group Tower of Power. To promote the album, Gordon directed the band&#x27;s only official music video, for its first single &quot;Down with Disease&quot;. &quot;Down with Disease&quot; became a minor hit on rock radio in the United States, and was the band&#x27;s first song to appear on a &quot;Billboard&quot; music chart when it peaked at #33 on the magazine&#x27;s Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart that summer. To further promote &quot;Hoist&quot;, the band released an experimental short-subject documentary called &quot;Tracking&quot;, also directed by Gordon, which depicted the recording sessions for the album.

Foreshadowing their future tradition of festivals, Phish coupled camping with their 1994 summer tour finale at Sugarbush North in Warren, Vermont, that show eventually being released as &quot;Live Phish Volume 2&quot;. On Halloween of that year, the group promised to don a fan-selected &quot;musical costume&quot; by playing an entire album from another band. After an extensive mail-based poll, Phish performed the Beatles&#x27; White Album as the second of their three sets at the Glens Falls Civic Center in upstate New York. The &quot;musical costume&quot; concept subsequently became a recurring part of Phish&#x27;s fall tours, with the band playing a different album whenever they had a concert scheduled for Halloween night.

In October 1994, &quot;Crimes of the Mind&quot;, the debut album by Anastasio&#x27;s friend and collaborator Steve &quot;The Dude of Life&quot; Pollak, was released by Elektra Records; The album, which had been recorded in 1991, was billed to &quot;The Dude of Life and Phish&quot; and features all four members of Phish acting as Pollak&#x27;s backing band.

On December 30, 1994, the band made their first appearance on national network television when they performed &quot;Chalk Dust Torture&quot; on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;. The band would go on to appear on the program seven more times before David Letterman&#x27;s retirement as host in 2015. For their 1994 New Years Run, Phish played the Civic Centers in Philadelphia and Providence as well as sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden and Boston Garden, which marked their debut performances at both venues. For the December 31 show at the Boston Garden, the band rode around the arena in a float shaped like a hot dog. The stunt was reprised at their 1999 New Year&#x27;s Eve concert before the hot dog was donated to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. At the end of 1994, Phish appeared on &quot;Pollstar&quot;&#x27;s list of the highest grossing concert tours in the United States for the first time, as the 32nd highest grossing act, with $10.3 million in ticket sales.

Following the death of Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia in the summer of 1995 and the appearance of &quot;Down with Disease&quot; on &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, the band experienced a surge in the growth of their fan base and an increased awareness in popular culture. In their tradition of playing a well-known album by another band for Halloween, Phish contracted a full horn section for their performance of The Who&#x27;s &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; in 1995.

Phish&#x27;s first live album, &quot;A Live One&quot;, was released during the summer of 1995 and featured selections from various concerts from their 1994 winter tour. The album charted at number 18 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, and was reported to have sold around 50,000 copies in its first week on sale. &quot;A Live One&quot; became Phish&#x27;s first RIAA-certified gold album in November 1995. In 1997, &quot;A Live One&quot; became the band&#x27;s first Platinum album, certified for sales of 1 million copies in the United States, and remains their best selling album to date.

Phish ended 1995 with their first New Year&#x27;s Eve concert at Madison Square Garden. The concert was released in its entirety on the live album &quot;&quot; in 2005.

===&quot;Billy Breathes&quot;, &quot;The Story of the Ghost&quot;, and &quot;The Siket Disc&quot;: 1996–1999===

In early 1996, Anastasio and Fishman formed a free jazz side-project called Surrender to the Air, inspired by the music of Sun Ra, which also featured Marshall Allen, Michael Ray, John Medeski, Oteil Burbridge, Kofi Burbridge, and Marc Ribot, among other musicians. The group&#x27;s only album, &quot;Surrender to the Air&quot;, was released in March.

Following an appearance at the New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival in April 1996, Phish spent the summer of that year opening for Santana on their European tour. In August 1996, the band held their first festival, The Clifford Ball, at the decommissioned Plattsburgh Air Force Base on the New York side of Lake Champlain. The festival attracted 70,000 attendees, making it both Phish&#x27;s biggest concert crowd to that point and the largest single concert by attendance in the United States in 1996. Phish recorded their sixth album &quot;Billy Breathes&quot; in the winter and spring of 1996, and the album was issued in October of that year. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Free&quot;, peaked at No. 24 on the Billboard Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and No. 11 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart, and was their most successful song on both charts.

By 1997, Phish&#x27;s concert improvisational ventures were developing into a new funk-inspired long form jamming style. Vermont-based ice cream conglomerate Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s launched &quot;Phish Food&quot; that year. The band officially licensed their name for use with the product, the only time they have ever allowed a third-party company to do so, and were directly involved with the creation of the flavor. Proceeds from the flavor are donated to the band&#x27;s non-profit charity The WaterWheel Foundation, which raises funds for the preservation of Vermont&#x27;s Lake Champlain. On August 8, 1997, Phish webcast one of their concerts live over the internet for the first time.

On August 16 and 17, 1997, Phish held their second festival, The Great Went, over two days at the Loring Air Force Base in Limestone, Maine, near the Canada–United States border. In October 1997, the band released their second live album &quot;Slip Stitch and Pass&quot;, which featured selections from their March 1997 concert at the Markthalle Hamburg in Hamburg, Germany.

Following the Great Went, the band embarked on a fall tour that was dubbed by fans as the &quot;Phish Destroys America&quot; tour after a 1970s kung fu-inspired poster for the opening date in Las Vegas. The 21-date tour is considered one of the group&#x27;s most popular and acclaimed tours, and several concerts were later officially released on live album sets such as &quot;Live Phish Volume 11&quot; in 2002. Phish ended 1997 as one of the ten highest grossing concert acts in the United States that year.

In April 1998, the band embarked on the Island Tour - a four night tour with two shows at the Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, New York on Long Island and another two at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island. The four concerts are highly regarded by fans due to the band&#x27;s exploration of a jazz-funk musical style they had been playing for the previous year, which Anastasio dubbed &quot;cowfunk&quot;. The band performed the tour in the middle of studio sessions for their seventh album, and were inspired by the quality of their performances to further incorporate the cowfunk style into subsequent sessions. The resulting album, &quot;The Story of the Ghost&quot;, was released in October 1998. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Birds of a Feather&quot;, which had been premiered on the Island Tour, became a #14 hit on Billboard&#x27;s Adult Alternative Songs chart. To promote &quot;The Story of the Ghost&quot;, Phish performed several songs from the album on the public television music show &quot;Sessions at West 54th&quot; in October 1998, and were interviewed for the program by its host David Byrne of Talking Heads.
In the summer of 1998, the band held Lemonwheel, their second festival at Loring Air Force Base in Maine. The two-day event attracted 60,000 attendees. The band played another summer festival in 1999, called Camp Oswego and held at the Oswego County Airport in Volney, New York. Unlike other Phish festivals, Camp Oswego featured a prominent second stage of additional performers aside from Phish, including Del McCoury, The Slip and Ozomatli.

In July 1999, the band released an album of improvisational instrumentals titled &quot;The Siket Disc&quot;. The band followed that release with &quot;Hampton Comes Alive&quot;, a six-disc box set released in November 1999, which contained the entirety of their performances on November 20 and 21, 1998 at the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, Virginia. The set marked the first time that complete recordings of Phish concerts were officially released by Elektra Records.
To celebrate the new millennium, Phish hosted a two-day outdoor festival at the Big Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation in Florida in December 1999. The festival&#x27;s climactic New Year&#x27;s Eve concert, referred to by fans as simply &quot;The Show&quot;, started at 11:35 p.m. on December 31, 1999, and continued through to sunrise on January 1, 2000, approximately eight hours later. The band&#x27;s performance of the song &quot;Heavy Things&quot; at the festival was broadcast live as part of ABC&#x27;s &quot;2000 Today&quot; millennium coverage, giving the band their biggest television audience up to that point. 75,000 people attended the sold-out two-day festival. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named the Big Cypress festival one of the &quot;50 Greatest Concerts of the Last 50 Years&quot;.

===&quot;Farmhouse&quot; and hiatus: 2000–2002===
Following the Big Cypress festival, the band issued their ninth studio album &quot;Farmhouse&quot; in May 2000. &quot;Heavy Things&quot;, which was released as the album&#x27;s first single, became the band&#x27;s only song to appear on a mainstream pop radio format, reaching #29 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Adult Top 40 chart that July. The song also became the band&#x27;s biggest hit to date on the Adult Alternative Songs chart, reaching #2 there. In June 2000, the band embarked on a seven-date headlining tour of Japan. In July, they taped an appearance on the PBS music show &quot;Austin City Limits&quot;, which was aired in October.

In the summer of 2000, the band announced that they would take their first &quot;extended time-out&quot; following their upcoming fall tour. Anastasio officially announced the impending hiatus to the band&#x27;s fans during their September 30 concert at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Paradise, Nevada. During the tour&#x27;s last concert on October 7, at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California, the band made no reference to the hiatus, and left the stage without saying a word following their encore performance of &quot;You Enjoy Myself&quot;, as The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot; played over the venue&#x27;s sound system.

&quot;Bittersweet Motel&quot;, a documentary film about the band directed by Todd Phillips, was released in August 2000, shortly before the hiatus began. The documentary captures the band&#x27;s 1997 and 1998 tours, the Great Went festival and the recording of &quot;The Story of the Ghost&quot;. Phish were nominated in two categories at the 43rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2001: Best Boxed Recording Package for &quot;Hampton Comes Alive&quot; and Best Instrumental Rock Performance for &quot;First Tube&quot; from &quot;Farmhouse&quot;.

During Phish&#x27;s hiatus, Elektra Records continued to issue archival releases of the band&#x27;s concerts on compact disc. Between September 2001 and May 2003, the label released 20 entries in the Live Phish Series. These multi-disc sets featured complete soundboard recordings of concerts that were particularly popular with the band and their fanbase, similar to the Grateful Dead&#x27;s Dick&#x27;s Picks archival series. In November 2002, the label released the band&#x27;s first concert DVD, &quot;&quot;, which featured the entirety of the September 2000 concert at which Anastasio announced the hiatus.

In April 2002, Phish guest starred on the episode &quot;Weekend at Burnsie&#x27;s&quot; of the animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The episode marked the band&#x27;s first appearance together, albeit as animated characters, since the hiatus began. Phish provided their own voices for the episode and performed a snippet of &quot;Run Like an Antelope&quot;.

=== Return, &quot;Round Room&quot;, &quot;Undermind&quot;, and disbandment: 2002–2004 ===

In August 2002, Phish&#x27;s manager John Paluska announced the band planned to end their hiatus that December with a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert at Madison Square Garden. They also recorded &quot;Round Room&quot; over the course of four days in October and released it on December 10. The band had initially planned to record the new album live at the Madison Square Garden concert, but instead felt that demos they had recorded of the material were strong enough to merit release as a studio album. Four days after the release of &quot;Round Room&quot;, the band appeared as a musical guest on the December 14 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, hosted by former Vice President of the United States Al Gore. During the episode, the band debuted the song &quot;46 Days&quot;, appeared in a comedy sketch, and their song &quot;You Enjoy Myself&quot; was featured in a &quot;TV Funhouse&quot; cartoon segment. During their return concert on December 31, McConnell&#x27;s brother was introduced as actor Tom Hanks. The impostor sang a line of the song &quot;Wilson&quot;, prompting some media outlets to report that the actor had appeared at the concert.
At the end of the 2003 summer tour, Phish returned to Limestone, Maine for It, their first festival since Big Cypress. The event drew crowds of over 60,000 fans, and was the band&#x27;s final festival to be held at Loring Air Force Base. Highlights from the festival were released on a DVD set, also called &quot;It&quot;, in October 2004. In November and December 2003, the band celebrated its 20th anniversary with a four-show mini-tour of shows in New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts. The December 1 show at Pepsi Arena featured a guest appearance by former member Jeff Holdsworth, who sat in with the band on five songs, including his compositions &quot;Possum&quot; and &quot;Camel Walk&quot;.

On May 25, 2004, Anastasio announced on the Phish website that the band would disband at the end of their 2004 summer tour. He wrote that he had met with the other members earlier that month to discuss the &quot;Strong feelings I&#x27;ve been having that Phish has run its course, and that we should end it now while it&#x27;s still on a high note.&quot; By the end of the meeting, he said, &quot;We realized that after almost twenty-one years together, we were faced with the opportunity to graciously step away in unison, as a group, united in our friendship and our feelings of gratitude.&quot; The band&#x27;s eleventh – and at the time final – studio album &quot;Undermind&quot; was released in June 2004. The band&#x27;s summer 2004 began with two concerts at Keyspan Park in Brooklyn, New York. The first concert was recorded for the live album and concert documentary &quot;&quot;, while the second featured a guest appearance by rapper Jay-Z, who performed two songs with the band. Later that summer, the band appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and performed a seven-song set from atop the marquee of the Ed Sullivan Theater for fans who had gathered on the street.

The 2004 tour finished with the band&#x27;s seventh summer festival on August 14 and 15, which were billed as their final performances. The Coventry festival was named for the town in Vermont that hosted the event, which was held at the nearby Newport State Airport. 
The concerts were simulcast in movie theaters and on XM Satellite Radio. &quot;The Curtain With&quot; was the final song the band performed at their then-final concert on August 15. After Coventry, the members of the band admitted they were disappointed with their performance at the festival; In the official book &quot;Phish: The Biography&quot;, Anastasio expressed that &quot;Coventry itself was a nightmare. It was emotional, but it was not like we were at our finest. I certainly wasn&#x27;t&quot;. The festival weekend was beset by logistical issues, including heavy rain, muddy conditions in the festival area and a traffic jam on Interstate 91.

===Post-disbandment and interim: 2004–2008===

Following the break-up, the band&#x27;s members remained in amicable communication with one another. The members also occasionally appeared on each other&#x27;s solo albums and collaborated on side-projects.

In 2005, Phish formed their own record label, JEMP Records, to release archival CD and DVD sets. The label&#x27;s first release was &quot;&quot;, which was released in conjunction with Rhino Records in December 2005. The album was named the 42nd greatest live album of all time by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in April 2015. The label subsequently released several other archival live box sets, including &quot;Colorado &#x27;88&quot; (2006), &quot;Vegas 96&quot; (2007), &quot;At the Roxy&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Clifford Ball&quot; (2009).

In December 2006, Anastasio was arrested in Whitehall, New York for drug possession and driving while intoxicated, and was sentenced to 14 months in a drug court program. In 2007, while Anastasio was undergoing rehabilitation, the other members of Phish surprised him on his birthday with an instrumental recording they had made for him to play along with on guitar. During his rehabilitation, Anastasio said he &quot;spent 24 hours a day thinking about nothing but Phish&quot; and began discussing a reunion with the other members of the band.

Phish received the Jammys Lifetime Achievement Award on May 7, 2008, at The Theater at Madison Square Garden. All four members attended the ceremony and gave a speech, and both McConnell and Anastasio performed, although not together.

In response to a June 2008 rumor that Phish had reunited to record a new album, McConnell wrote a letter on the band&#x27;s website updating fans on the current relations between the band&#x27;s members. McConnell wrote that while the members remained friends, they were currently busy with other projects and the reunion rumors were premature. He added, &quot;Later this year we hope to spend some time together and take a look at what possible futures we might enjoy.&quot; That September, the band played three songs at the wedding of their former tour manager Brad Sands. Later in 2008, the band reconvened at The Barn, Anastasio&#x27;s farmhouse studio in Burlington, Vermont, for jamming sessions and rehearsals.

===Reunion and &quot;Joy&quot;: 2008–2011===
On October 1, 2008, the band announced on their website that they had officially reunited, and would play their first shows in five years in March 2009 at the Hampton Coliseum in Hampton, Virginia. The three reunion concerts were held on March 6, 7, and 8, 2009, with &quot;Fluffhead&quot; being the first song the band played onstage at the first show. Approximately 14,000 people attended the concerts over the course of three days, and the band made the shows available for free download on their LivePhish website for a limited time, in order to accommodate fans who were unable to attend.

When the band decided to reunite, the members agreed to limit their touring schedule, and they have typically performed about 50 concerts a year since. Following the reunion weekend, Phish embarked on a summer tour which began in May with a concert at Fenway Park in Boston. The Fenway show was followed by a 25-date tour which included performances at the 2009 edition of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee and a four date stand at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Colorado. At Bonnaroo, Phish was joined by Bruce Springsteen on guitar for three songs.
Phish&#x27;s fourteenth studio album, &quot;Joy&quot;, produced by Steve Lillywhite, was released September 8, 2009. &quot;Backwards Down the Number Line&quot;, a single from the &quot;Joy&quot; album, reached number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Alternative Songs chart in October. In October, the band held Festival 8, their first multi-day festival event since Coventry in 2004, at the Empire Polo Club in Indio, California. 

In March 2010, Anastasio inducted Genesis, one of his favorite bands, into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at the museum&#x27;s annual ceremony in New York City. In addition to Anastasio&#x27;s speech, Phish performed the Genesis songs &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; and &quot;No Reply at All&quot; at the event. Phish toured in the summer and fall of 2010, and their concerts at Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy, Wisconsin and the Utica Memorial Auditorium in Utica, New York were issued as CD/DVD sets in 2010 and 2011 respectively.

=== &quot;Fuego&quot; and &quot;Big Boat&quot;: 2011–2016 ===
Phish&#x27;s ninth festival, Super Ball IX, took place at the Watkins Glen International race track in Watkins Glen, New York on July 1–3, 2011. It was the first concert to take place at Watkins Glen International since Summer Jam at Watkins Glen in 1973. In September, the band played a benefit concert in Essex Junction, Vermont which raised $1.2 million for Vermont flood victim relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene.

In June 2012, Phish headlined Bonnaroo 2012 with the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Radiohead. During their 2013 Halloween concert at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the band played twelve new songs from their upcoming album, which at the time had the working title &quot;Wingsuit&quot; and would later be renamed &quot;Fuego&quot;. During the concert, the band was joined onstage by actor Abe Vigoda, who is mentioned by name in the song &quot;Wombat&quot;, dressed in a wombat costume.

Phish ended 2013 with a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert at Madison Square Garden that also celebrated their 30th anniversary, as they had played their first concert in December 1983. The concert featured a nine-minute montage film celebrating the band&#x27;s career, and the band performed an entire set in the middle of the arena from atop an equipment truck.

Phish released &quot;Fuego&quot;, their first studio album in five years, on June 24, 2014. The album peaked at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; album chart, and became their highest charting album since &quot;Billy Breathes&quot; reached the same position in 1996. During their Halloween 2014 concert at MGM Grand Las Vegas, the band performed a set consisting of ten original songs inspired by the 1964 Walt Disney Records sound effects album &quot;Chilling, Thrilling Sounds of the Haunted House.&quot;
In 2015, Phish performed both a summer tour and their tenth multi-day festival event, Magnaball, was held at the Watkins International Speedway in New York in August. Phish&#x27;s fourteenth studio album, &quot;Big Boat&quot;, was released on October 7, 2016.

=== The Baker&#x27;s Dozen and Kasvot Växt: 2017–2019 ===

Phish played a 13-night concert residency at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden from July 21 to August 6, 2017, dubbed &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Dozen&quot;. Each concert featured a loose theme with performances of unique cover songs and a special doughnut served each night to the audience by Federal Donuts of Philadelphia. No songs were repeated during the Baker&#x27;s Dozen run, with a total of 237 individual songs performed across the 13 concerts. The complete Baker&#x27;s Dozen residency was released as a limited edition 36-disc box set in November 2018. A scaled-down triple CD set featuring 13 song performances, titled &quot;The Baker&#x27;s Dozen: Live at Madison Square Garden&quot;, was issued simultaneously with the box set.

Phish planned to hold an eleventh summer festival, Curveball, in Watkins Glen, New York in 2018, but the festival was canceled by New York Department of Health officials, one day before it was scheduled to begin, due to water quality issues from flooding in the area. At their Halloween concert that October at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, the band performed a set of all-new original material that they promoted as a &quot;cover&quot; of &quot;í rokk&quot; by Kasvot Växt, a fictional 1980s Scandinavian progressive rock band they had created. The Kasvot Växt set was released as a standalone live album on Spotify on November 10, 2018. All four concerts in the 2018 Halloween run were livestreamed in 4K resolution, which marked the first time that a major musical act had ever offered a 4K livestreaming option.
&quot;Between Me and My Mind&quot;, a documentary film directed by Steven Cantor about Anastasio&#x27;s life, his Ghosts of the Forest side-project and Phish&#x27;s 2017 New Year&#x27;s Eve concert, was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival in April 2019. In June 2019, SiriusXM launched Phish Radio, a satellite radio station dedicated to the band&#x27;s music.

===&quot;Sigma Oasis&quot; and &quot;Evolve&quot;: 2020–present===
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Phish postponed their 2020 summer tour until 2021. Before 2020, Phish had embarked on a summer tour every year since their 2009 reunion. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Phish hosted free weekly &quot;Dinner and a Movie&quot; webcasts of archival performances on Tuesday evenings until Labor Day weekend, after which they were hosted monthly.

Phish released their fifteenth studio album &quot;Sigma Oasis&quot; on April 2, 2020. The album was premiered through a listening party on their LivePhish app, SiriusXM radio station and Facebook page. The album consists entirely of material the band had been performing in concert over the course of the previous decade, but had yet to appear on a studio release.

In January 2021, Anastasio told &quot;Pollstar&quot; that the band was unable to perform or rehearse together due to COVID-19 restrictions and quarantine rules currently in place in the New England states, but said &quot;As soon as it&#x27;s feasible, we&#x27;ll be back.&quot;

Phish performed their first concert since the start of the pandemic on July 28, 2021, at the Walmart AMP in Rogers, Arkansas, having not performed since February 23, 2020. Beginning with their concerts at The Gorge Amphitheatre in late August, the band began requiring attendees to show proof of vaccination or a negative test for COVID-19. During their 2021 Halloween concert, Phish debuted a set of new original science fiction-themed material under the guise of the fictional band Sci-Fi Soldier. According to &quot;Pollstar&quot;, Phish were the ninth highest grossing concert act in the world in 2021, with a $44.4 million gross from 35 concerts. Phish also had the fifth highest concert ticket sales in the world in 2021, with 572,626 tickets sold. 

Due to an increase of cases of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in New York City, Phish postponed their 2021 New Year&#x27;s Eve concerts at Madison Square Garden from December 2021 to April 2022. In lieu of the traditional New Year&#x27;s Eve concert, Phish instead performed a three set New Year&#x27;s Eve concert on December 31, 2021 from a soundstage they dubbed &quot;The Ninth Cube&quot;. 

Phish released &quot;Get More Down&quot;, a studio version of their Sci-Fi Soldier material, on October 31, 2022. In August 2023, Phish performed two benefit concerts at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, New York for recovery efforts following a flood in Vermont and upstate New York earlier that summer. The band raised $3.5 million for the relief efforts through their two concerts and merchandise sales. The band performed a version of their Gamehendge song cycle at their 2023 New Year&#x27;s Eve concert at Madison Square Garden, which featured actors portraying the story&#x27;s characters, and an appearance by actress and musician Annie Golden during the song &quot;Harpua&quot;.
Phish performed four concerts at Sphere in Paradise, Nevada in April 2024, and were the second music act, after U2, to perform at the venue. The concerts featured visual effects created by the Montreal studio Moment Factory. The four shows grossed $13.4 million from 65,665 tickets sold.

&quot;Evolve&quot;, Phish&#x27;s sixteenth studio album, was released on July 12, 2024. Mondegreen, a four day Phish festival at the Woodlands of Dover Motor Speedway in Dover, Delaware, was held in August 2024. 45,000 people attended the four-day Mondegreen festival.

Phish were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the first time in 2025.

==Reception and legacy==
Phish were part of the jam band scene that gained prominence in the mid 1990s. Following the death of Jerry Garcia in 1995, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; named Phish as among the scene&#x27;s most prominent bands, alongside Blues Traveler, the Dave Matthews Band, Spin Doctors, and Widespread Panic. Phish&#x27;s popularity grew in the 1990s due to fans sharing concert recordings that had been taped by audience members and distributed online for free. Phish were among the first musical acts to utilize the internet to grow their fanbase, with fans using file-sharing websites such as etree and BitTorrent to share concerts.

In 1998, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Phish as &quot;the most important band of the &#x27;90s&quot;. Phish have been named as an influence by other acts in the jam band scene, including Umphrey&#x27;s McGee and the Disco Biscuits Other musicians have also counted Phish as an influence, including Adam Levine and James Valentine of Maroon 5, Ed O&#x27;Brien of Radiohead, Brandon Boyd of Incubus, and reggae musician Matisyahu.

Phish&#x27;s festival events in the 1990s inspired the foundation of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which was first held in 2002. Co-founder Rick Farman, a Phish fan, consulted Phish managers Richard Glasgow and John Paluska about festival infrastructure during the early stages of planning. The festivals also inspired other jam band-oriented concert events, such as the Disco Biscuits&#x27; Camp Bisco, Electric Forest Festival, and the Big Ears Festival.

Phish are well known to their loyal fans, called Phishheads, but the group&#x27;s music and fan culture are otherwise polarizing to general audiences. The tribal nature of Phish supporters has encouraged comparisons of Phishheads to the Juggalos, followers of the hip-hop duo Insane Clown Posse. Phish heavily contributes to music-based tourism with their &quot;traveling communities&quot; of fans, and they have been simultaneously hailed and criticized for their near-constant tour dates, which bring with them the capital value of tourism and necessitates the increased security and community planning that come with any music festival. Jordan Hoffman of Thrillist explains &quot;the solace many find in attending religious services is somewhat mirrored for me in seeing Phish,&quot; and even though Phish fans are generally considered welcoming and friendly, the reception of the group from the outside is often one of unease and confusion. The BBC listed Phish as one of &quot;Eight smash US acts that Britain never understood&quot; along with fellow jam bands Dave Matthews Band and Blues Traveler. In describing the band to a British audience, BBC journalist Stephen Dowling wrote &quot;Attending a Phish gig has become a rite of summer passage for American teens in the same way that attending Glastonbury has for British teenagers.&quot;

The band has a number of celebrity fans, including: Sean Avery, Rocco Baldelli, Drew Carey, Tucker Carlson, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Abbi Jacobson, Katy Tur, Aron Ralston, and Bill Walton. Bernie Sanders, who was the mayor of Burlington when Phish formed, described them as &quot;One of the great bands in this country&quot; in 2016.

Phish has performed 87 concerts at Madison Square Garden since their debut performance there in 1994. In August 2023, Phish surpassed Elton John as the musical act with the second most concerts performed at Madison Square Garden, behind only record-holder Billy Joel.

In 2019, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Phish as the 33rd highest-grossing concert touring act of the 2010s. In 2022, &quot;Pollstar&quot; listed Phish as the 33rd highest grossing touring act from 1980 to 2022, with a cumulative gross of $595.8 million. &quot;Pollstar&quot; also listed Phish as the act with the ninth most tickets sold in that same time frame, with 13.3 million tickets sold.

==Musical style and influences==
According to &quot;The New Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot;, the music of Phish is &quot;oriented around group improvisation and super-extended grooves&quot;. Their songs draw on a range of rock-oriented influences, including funk, jazz fusion, progressive rock, bluegrass, and psychedelic rock. Some Phish songs use different vocal approaches, such as a cappella (unaccompanied) sections of barbershop quartet-style vocal harmonies. The band began to include barbershop segments in their concerts in 1993, when the four members began taking lessons from McConnell&#x27;s landlord, who was a judge at barbershop competitions. In the 1997 official biography, &quot;The Phish Book&quot;, Anastasio coined the term &quot;cow-funk&quot; to describe the band&#x27;s late 1990s funk and jazz-funk-influenced playing style, observing that &quot;What we&#x27;re doing now is really more about groove than funk. Good funk, real funk, is not played by four white guys from Vermont.&quot;

Phish were often compared to the Grateful Dead during the 1990s, a comparison that the band members often resisted or distanced themselves from. The two bands were compared due to their emphasis on live performances, improvisational jamming style, musical similarities, and traveling fanbase. In November 1995, Anastasio told &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, &quot;When we first came into the awareness of the media, it would always be the Dead or Zappa they&#x27;d compare us to. All of these bands I love, you know? But I got very sensitive about it.&quot; Early in their career, Phish would occasionally cover Grateful Dead songs in concert, but the band stopped doing so by the late 1980s. In &quot;Phish: The Biography&quot;, Parke Puterbaugh observed &quot;The bottom line is while it&#x27;s impossible to imagine Phish without the Grateful Dead as forebears, many other musicians figured as influences upon them. Some of them - such as Carlos Santana and Frank Zappa - were arguably at least as significant as the Grateful Dead. In reality, the media certainly overplayed the Grateful Dead connection and Phish probably underplayed it, at least in their first decade.&quot; Anastasio has also cited progressive rock artists such as King Crimson and Genesis as significant influences on Phish&#x27;s early material. In a 2019 &quot;New York Times&quot; interview, he observed, &quot;If you listen to the first couple of Phish albums, they don&#x27;t sound anything like the Grateful Dead. I was more interested in Yes.&quot;

In his 2018 book &quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot;, music critic Steven Hyden wrote that he found the Grateful Dead and Phish to have &quot;significantly different reference points&quot; in terms of influence and style. The Grateful Dead, Hyden explained, were &quot;informed by the totality of American music from the first sixty years of the twentieth century: Blues, country, folk, jazz, and early rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll,&quot; while Phish&#x27;s music contains elements of &quot;hopped-up bluegrass, jazzy disco, porno-movie funk, Broadway theatricality, and shockingly sincere barbershop harmonies. But it all stems from classic rock.&quot; Hyden observed that &quot;If the Dead encompasses American music from roughly 1900 to 1967, Phish picks up the story right through the AOR era, from &#x27;68 to around the time &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; debuted in theaters in the mid-eighties.&quot;

==Live performances==

The driving force behind Phish is the popularity of their concerts and the fan culture surrounding the event. Each a production unto itself, the band is known to consistently change set lists and details, as well as the addition of their own antics to ensure that no two shows are ever the same. With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot similar to the &quot;Shakedown Street&quot; bazaar held outside Grateful Dead concerts.

Similar to the Grateful Dead, Phish concerts typically feature two sets, with an intermission in between. During concerts, songs often segue into one another, or produce improvisational jams that can last 10 minutes or more depending on the song. Several regularly performed songs in Phish&#x27;s repertoire have never appeared on one of their studio albums; these include &quot;Possum&quot;, &quot;Mike&#x27;s Song&quot;, &quot;I Am Hydrogen&quot;, &quot;Weekapaug Groove&quot;, &quot;Harry Hood&quot;, &quot;Runaway Jim&quot;, &quot;Suzy Greenberg&quot;, &quot;AC/DC Bag&quot; and &quot;The Lizards&quot;, all of which date to 1990 or earlier and have been played by Phish over 300 times in concert.

Chris Kuroda, who has been Phish&#x27;s lighting director since 1989, creates elaborate light displays during the band&#x27;s concerts that are sometimes improvised in a similar fashion to their music. Justin Taylor of &quot;The Baffler&quot; wrote, &quot;You could hate this music with every fiber of your being and still be ready to give Chris Kuroda a MacArthur &quot;genius&quot; grant for what he achieves with his light rig.&quot; Kuroda is often referred to by fans as the unofficial fifth member of the band, and has been given the nickname &quot;CK5&quot;.

Since Phish fans began to discuss the band&#x27;s live performances on the internet in the late 1990s, they have developed a widely used framework for analyzing the varied forms of improvisation that would regularly occur during a given show. A January 1997 post by Phish fan John Flynn on the rec.music.phish Usenet group first defined the two &quot;types&quot; of jamming that Phish performs in concert. Flynn wrote: &quot;I think Phish jamming falls into two types of jamming: 1) Jamming that is based around a fixed chord progression 2) Jamming that improvises chord progressions, rhythms, and the whole structure of the music.&quot; Since then, Phish fans have used the terms &quot;Type 1&quot; and &quot;Type 2&quot; and Flynn&#x27;s definitions to contextualize the structure of Phish&#x27;s shows and songs.

Because Phish&#x27;s reputation is so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly traded commodities. In December 2002, the band launched the LivePhish website, from which official soundboard recordings can be purchased. Legal field recordings produced by tapers with boom microphones from the audience in compliance with Phish&#x27;s tape trading policy are frequently traded on any number of music message boards. Although technically not allowed, live videos of Phish shows are also traded by fans and are tolerated as long as they are for non-profit, personal use. Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.

Fans&#x27; recordings are generally sourced from the officially designated tapers&#x27; section at each show, by fans with devoted sound recording rigs. Tickets for the tapers&#x27; section are acquired separately from regular audience tickets, and directly from the band&#x27;s website, instead of the venue or a service like Ticketmaster. However, tapers are also required to purchase a general admission ticket for concerts. Recordings patched from Paul Languedoc&#x27;s soundboard were also made until 1994 and circulated among fans.

In 2014, the band launched their own on-demand streaming service, LivePhish+. The platform features hundreds of soundboard recordings of the band&#x27;s concerts for streaming, including all of their shows from 2002 onwards, as well as all of their studio albums. Phish continues to allow fans to tape and distribute audience recordings of their concerts after the launch of the LivePhish storefront and streaming services.

==Books and podcasts==
Several books on Phish have been published, including two official publications: &quot;The Phish Book&quot;, a 1998 coffee table book credited to the band members and journalist Richard Gehr which focused on the band&#x27;s activities during 1996 and 1997, and &quot;Phish: The Biography&quot;, a semi-official biographical book written by music journalist and Phish fan Parke Puterbaugh, was published in 2009 and was based on interviews with the four band members, their friends and crew. An installment of the 33⅓ book series on &quot;A Live One&quot;, written by Walter Holland, was published in 2015. The 2013 book &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Me but You Don&#x27;t Like Me: Phish, Insane Clown Posse, and My Misadventures with Two of Music&#x27;s Most Maligned Tribes&quot;, written by music critic Nathan Rabin, compares and contrasts the fanbases of Phish and Insane Clown Posse.

In addition to books, there have been multiple podcasts which have focused on Phish, its music and fanbase as their central topics of discussion. Among the first was &quot;Analyze Phish&quot;, which was hosted by comedians Harris Wittels and Scott Aukerman for the Earwolf podcast network, and ran for ten episodes posted between 2011 and 2014. The podcast followed Wittels, a devoted fan of the band, in his humorous attempts to get Aukerman to enjoy their music. Despite its truncated run, &quot;Analyze Phish&quot; inspired Phish lyricist Tom Marshall to start his own Phish podcast, &quot;Under the Scales&quot;, in 2016. In 2018, Marshall co-founded the Osiris Podcasting Network, which hosts &quot;Under the Scales&quot; and other music podcasts, many of which are devoted to Phish or other jam bands. In September 2019, C13Originals debuted &quot;Long May They Run&quot;, a music documentary podcast series; The first season, consisting of 10 episodes, focused on Phish&#x27;s history and influence on the live music scene. In November 2019, the Osiris Podcasting Network premiered &quot;After Midnight,&quot; a five-episode documentary series exploring the creation, execution, and aftermath of Phish&#x27;s 1999 Big Cypress festival.

==Other appearances==
Seattle Seahawks fans began mimicking Phish&#x27;s song &quot;Wilson&quot; by chanting the song&#x27;s opening line when quarterback Russell Wilson took the field during games. The new tradition started after Anastasio made the suggestion at shows in Seattle. The story behind the &quot;Wilson&quot; chant was featured in a 2014 documentary short by NFL Films.

<text>Precision Architecture [[reduced instruction set computer|RISC]] (PA-RISC) or Hewlett Packard Precision Architecture (HP/PA or simply HPPA), is a general purpose computer instruction set architecture (ISA) developed by Hewlett-Packard from the 1980s until the 2000s.

The architecture was introduced on 26 February 1986, when the HP 3000 Series 930 and HP 9000 Model 840 computers were launched featuring the first implementation, the TS1. HP stopped selling PA-RISC-based HP 9000 systems at the end of 2008 but supported servers running PA-RISC chips until 2013. PA-RISC was succeeded by the Itanium (originally IA-64) ISA, jointly developed by HP and Intel.

==History==
In the late 1980s, HP was building four series of computers, all based on CISC CPUs. One line was the IBM PC compatible Intel i286-based Vectra Series, started in 1986. All others were non-Intel systems. One of them was the HP Series 300 of Motorola 68000-based workstations, another Series 200 line of technical workstations based on a custom silicon on sapphire (SOS) chip design, the SOS based 16-bit HP 3000 classic series, and finally the HP 9000 Series 500 minicomputers, based on their own (16- and 32-bit) FOCUS microprocessor.

The Precision Architecture is the result of what was known inside Hewlett-Packard as the Spectrum program. HP planned to use Spectrum to move all of their non-PC compatible machines to a single RISC CPU family.

In early 1982, work on the Precision Architecture began at HP Laboratories, defining the instruction set and virtual memory system. Development of the first TTL implementation started in April 1983. With simulation of the processor having completed in 1983, a final processor design was delivered to software developers in July 1984. Systems prototyping followed, with &quot;lab prototypes&quot; being produced in 1985 and product prototypes in 1986.

The first processors were introduced in products during 1986. It has thirty-two 32-bit integer registers and sixteen 64-bit floating-point registers. The HP Precision Architecture has a single branch delay slot. This means that the instruction immediately following a branch instruction is executed before the program&#x27;s control flow is transferred to the target instruction of the branch. An HP Precision processor also includes a Processor Status Word (PSW) register. The PSW register contains various flags that enable virtual addressing, protection, interruptions, and other status information. The number of floating-point registers was doubled in the 1.1 version to 32 once it became apparent that 16 were inadequate and restricted performance. The architects included Allen Baum, Hans Jeans, Michael J. Mahon, Ruby Bei-Loh Lee, Russel Kao, Steve Muchnick, Terrence C. Miller, David Fotland, and William S. Worley.

The first implementation was the TS1, a central processing unit built from discrete transistor–transistor logic (74F TTL) devices. Later implementations were multi-chip VLSI designs fabricated in NMOS processes (NS1 and NS2) and CMOS (CS1 and PCX).
They were first used in a new series of HP 3000 machines in the late 1980s – the 930 and 950, commonly known at the time as Spectrum systems, the name given to them in the development labs. These machines ran MPE-XL. The HP 9000 machines were soon upgraded with the PA-RISC processor as well, running the HP-UX version of Unix.

Other operating systems ported to the PA-RISC architecture include Linux, OpenBSD, NetBSD, OSF/1, NeXTSTEP, and ChorusOS.

An interesting aspect of the PA-RISC line is that most of its generations have no level 2 cache. Instead large level 1 caches are used, initially as separate chips connected by a bus, and later integrated on-chip. Only the PA-7100LC and PA-7300LC have L2 caches. Another innovation of the PA-RISC is the addition of vector instructions (SIMD) in the form of MAX, which were first introduced on the PA-7100LC.

Precision RISC Organization, an industry group led by HP, was founded in 1992, to promote the PA-RISC architecture. Members included Convex, Hitachi, Hughes Aircraft, Mitsubishi, NEC, OKI, Prime, Stratus, Yokogawa, Red Brick Software, and Allegro Consultants, Inc.

The ISA was extended in 1996 to 64 bits, with this revision named PA-RISC 2.0. PA-RISC 2.0 also added fused multiply–add instructions, which help certain floating-point intensive algorithms, and the MAX-2 SIMD extension, which provides instructions for accelerating multimedia applications. The first PA-RISC 2.0 implementation was the PA-8000, which was introduced in January 1996.

<text>Preacher is an American comic book series published from 1995 to 2000 by Vertigo, an imprint of DC Comics. The series was created by writer Garth Ennis and artist Steve Dillon, with painted covers by Glenn Fabry. It won the Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series in 1999.

The series consists of 75 issues in total – 66 regular, monthly issues, five one-shot specials, and a four-issue &quot;Preacher: Saint of Killers&quot; limited series. The final monthly issue, number 66, was published in October 2000, with an epilogue published in Ennis&#x27; subsequent series &quot;The Boys&quot; in February 2009. The entire run has been collected in four series of collected editions: an original nine volume run of trade paperbacks, a second run of six trade paperbacks/hardcovers, three extra oversized &quot;Absolute Preacher&quot; volumes, and two oversized omnibus volumes.

A television series adaptation, &quot;Preacher&quot;, aired for 43 episodes over four seasons on AMC, from 2015 to 2019.

==Plot==

&quot;Preacher&quot; tells the story of Jesse Custer, a preacher in the small Texas town of Annville. Custer is accidentally possessed by the supernatural creature named Genesis, the infant of the unauthorized, unnatural coupling of an angel and a demon. The incident flattens Custer&#x27;s church and kills his entire congregation.

Genesis has no sense of individual will, but since it is composed of both pure goodness and pure evil, its power might rival that of God Himself, making Jesse Custer, bonded to Genesis, potentially the most powerful being in the universe.

Driven by a strong sense of right and wrong, Custer journeys across the United States attempting to literally find God, who abandoned Heaven the moment Genesis was born. He also begins to discover the truth about his new powers, allowing him, when he wills it, to command the obedience of those who hear and comprehend his words. He is joined by old girlfriend Tulip O&#x27;Hare, as well as a hard-drinking Irish vampire named Cassidy.

During the course of their journeys, the three encounter enemies and obstacles both sacred and profane, including The Saint of Killers, an invincible, quick-drawing, perfect-aiming, come-lately Angel of Death answering only to &quot;He Who Sits On The Throne&quot;; a disfigured suicide attempt survivor turned rock-star named Arseface; a serial-killer called the &#x27;Reaver-Cleaver&#x27;; The Grail, a secret organization controlling the governments of the world and protecting the bloodline of Jesus; Herr Starr, primary enforcer for The Grail, a megalomaniac with a penchant for prostitutes, who wishes to use Custer for his own ends; several fallen angels; and Jesse&#x27;s own redneck family — particularly his nasty Cajun grandmother, her mighty bodyguard Jody, and the Zoophilic T.C.

Additionally, the book &quot;Preacher: Dead or Alive&quot; () collects Fabry&#x27;s covers to the series.

==Adaptations==
===Adaptation attempts===
Garth Ennis, feeling &quot;Preacher&quot; would translate perfectly as a film, sold the film rights to Electric Entertainment. Rachel Talalay was hired to direct, with Ennis writing the script. Rupert Harvey and Tom Astor were set as producers. By May 1998, Ennis completed three drafts of the script, based largely on the &quot;Gone to Texas&quot; story arc. The filmmakers found it difficult financing &quot;Preacher&quot; because investors found the idea religiously controversial. Ennis approached Kevin Smith and Scott Mosier to help finance the film under their View Askew Productions banner. Ennis, Smith and Mosier pitched &quot;Preacher&quot; to Bob Weinstein at Miramax Films.

Weinstein was confused by the characterization of Jesse Custer. Miramax also did not want to share the box office gross with Electric Entertainment, ultimately dropping the pitch. By May 2000, Smith and Mosier were still attached to produce with Talalay directing, but Smith did not know the status of &quot;Preacher&quot;, feeling it would languish in development hell. By then, Storm Entertainment, a UK-based production company known for their work on independent films, joined the production with Electric Entertainment. In September 2001, the two companies announced &quot;Preacher&quot; had been greenlighted to commence pre-production, with filming to begin in November and Talalay still directing Ennis&#x27; script. The production and start dates were pushed back because of financial issues of the $25 million projected budget.

James Marsden was cast in the lead role as Jesse Custer sometime in 2002. He explained, &quot;It was something I never knew anything about, but once I got my hands on the comic books, I was blown away by it.&quot; In a March 2004 interview, Marsden said the filmmakers were hoping for filming to start the following August. With the full-length film adaptation eventually abandoned with budgetary concerns, HBO announced in November 2006 that they commissioned Mark Steven Johnson and Howard Deutch to produce a television pilot. Johnson was to write with Deutch directing. Impressed with Johnson&#x27;s pilot script, HBO had him write the series bible for the first season. Johnson first planned &quot;to turn each comic book issue into a single episode&quot; on a shot-for-shot basis. &quot;I gave [HBO] the comics, and I said, &#x27;Every issue is an hour&#x27;. Ennis said &#x27;You don&#x27;t have to be so beholden to the comic&#x27;. And I&#x27;m like, &#x27;No, no, no. It&#x27;s got to be like the comic&#x27;.&quot;

Johnson also wanted to make sure that one-shots were included as well. Johnson changed his position, citing new storylines conceived by Ennis. &quot;Well, there would be nothing new to add if we did that, so Garth [Ennis] and I have been creating new stories for the series,&quot; he said. &quot;I love the book so much and I was telling Garth that he has to make the stories we are coming up with as comics because I want to see them.&quot; By August 2008, new studio executives at HBO decided to abandon the idea, finding it too stylistically dark and religiously controversial. Columbia Pictures then purchased the film rights in October 2008 with Sam Mendes planned to direct. Neal H. Moritz and Jason Netter would have produced the film. The previous scripts written by Ennis would not have been used.

===AMC television series===

On November 16, 2013, it was announced that AMC would be shooting a pilot for &quot;Preacher&quot;. On November 18, 2013, &quot;Bleeding Cool&quot; confirmed that Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg had developed the series pilot with Sam Catlin, and that it would be distributed by Sony Pictures Television. On February 7, 2014, it was made public that AMC was officially developing the series to television based on the pilot written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. Rogen had no plans to co-star in the series. On May 9, 2014, AMC announced that &quot;Preacher&quot; was picked up to series. &quot;Preacher&quot; was slated to premiere mid to late 2015, as announced by Seth Rogen, with the script for the series complete and the pilot ordered by the studio. Comic creators Steve Dillon and Garth Ennis were to work on this project as co-executive producer. On April 17, 2015, Seth Rogen tweeted that Dominic Cooper was cast in the role of Jesse Custer, Joseph Gilgun as Cassidy, Ruth Negga as Tulip O&#x27;Hare, Ian Colletti as Arseface, and W. Earl Brown as Sheriff Hugo Root. On September 9, 2015, Seth Rogen announced via Twitter that the series ordered to a ten-episode first season and was due to premiere in mid-2016. The series premiered on AMC on Sunday, May 22, 2016, and concluded July 31. A second season, with thirteen episodes, aired from June 25 to September 11, 2017. From June 24 to August 26, 2018, a ten-episode third season aired. In November 2018, the series was renewed for a fourth and final ten-episode season, with production relocating to Australia, and the season airing from August 4 to September 29, 2019.

===GraphicAudio audiobook series===
In May 2020, all 98 issues of Garth Ennis&#x27; &quot;The Boys&quot; comic book series and the 8-issue epilogue series &quot;Dear Becky&quot; were adapted into seven full cast audiobooks produced by GraphicAudio, with all volumes numbering a combined 31 hours in length. In the second audiobook, the &quot;Preacher&quot; epilogue from &quot;We Gotta Go Now&quot; is adapted, with Michael John Casey voicing Proinsias Cassidy.

==Legacy==
Stephen King has said that his comic book series &quot;The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Born&quot;, based on his &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series of novels, was influenced by &quot;Preacher&quot;.

The character Yorick from &quot;&quot;, has a Zippo lighter with the words &quot;Fuck Communism&quot; engraved, identical to the one owned by Jesse Custer in &quot;Preacher&quot;. When asked about it he says it is &quot;from this book I read once... a graphic novel. You know, like a comic book.&quot; The phrase originated as a 1963 satirical poster produced by &quot;The Realist&quot; magazine&#x27;s Paul Krassner. This lighter appears later in the series when Yorick and Agent 355 are being held by Russian agents at gunpoint, who find the lighter and take offense to it.

In February 2009, an older now-human Proinsias Cassidy appears in a epilogue cameo role in the fourth volume of Garth Ennis&#x27; first ongoing comic book series after &quot;Preacher&quot;, the DC Comics (WildStorm)/Dynamite Entertainment series &quot;The Boys&quot; – &quot;We Gotta Go Now&quot; – in the twenty-seventh issue overall, depicted as a former friend and sponsor of Billy Butcher working as a bartender, clearing out his bar on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day so that Billy can drink in peace while waiting for Wee Hughie Campbell.

IGN declared &quot;Preacher&quot; the third-greatest Vertigo comic, after &quot;The Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot; and &quot;The Sandman&quot;.

Jesse Custer was ranked the 11th Greatest Comic Book Character by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine. The Saint of Killers was ranked at number 42 on the same list.

<text>A preacher is a person who delivers sermons or homilies on religious topics to an assembly of people. Less common are preachers who preach on the street, or those whose message is not necessarily religious, but who preach components such as a moral or social worldview or philosophy.

==History==
Preachers are common throughout most cultures. They can take the form of a Christian minister on a Sunday morning, or an Islamic imam. A Muslim preacher in general is referred to as a &quot;dā‘ī&quot;, while one giving sermons on a Friday afternoon is called a &quot;khatib&quot;.

The sermon or homily has been an important part of Christian services since Early Christianity, and remains prominent in both Roman Catholicism and Protestantism. Lay preachers sometimes figure in these traditions of worship, for example the Methodist local preachers, but in general preaching has usually been a function of the clergy. The Dominican Order is officially known as the &quot;Order of Preachers&quot; ( in Latin); friars of this order were trained to publicly preach in vernacular languages, and the order was created by Saint Dominic to preach to the Cathars of southern France in the early thirteenth century. The Franciscans are another important preaching order; Travelling preachers, usually friars, were an important feature of late medieval Catholicism.

In most denominations, modern preaching is kept below about 40 minutes, but historic preachers of all denominations could at times speak for well over an hour, sometimes for two or three hours, and use techniques of rhetoric and theatre that are today somewhat out of fashion in mainline churches.

In many churches in the United States, the title &quot;preacher&quot; is synonymous with &quot;pastor&quot; or &quot;minister&quot;, and the church&#x27;s minister is often referred to simply as &quot;our/the preacher&quot; or by name such as &quot;Preacher Smith&quot;. However, among some Chinese churches, &#x27;preacher&#x27; () is different from &#x27;pastor&#x27; (). A preacher in the Protestant church is one of the younger clergy, but they are not officially recognised as pastors until they can prove their capability of leading the church.

==Other uses==

&quot;Preacher&quot; is also the supposed author of the Book of Ecclesiastes. Preacher is one translation of the Hebrew word (). There is much debate about the identity of this preacher; many believe it is Solomon.
