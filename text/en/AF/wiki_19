<text>The Polaris Sales Agreement was a treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom which began the UK Polaris programme. The agreement was signed on 6 April 1963. It formally arranged the terms and conditions under which the Polaris missile system was provided to the United Kingdom.

The United Kingdom had been planning to buy the air-launched Skybolt missile to extend the operational life of the British V bombers, but the United States decided to cancel the Skybolt program in 1962 as it no longer needed the missile. The crisis created by the cancellation prompted an emergency meeting between the President of the United States, John F. Kennedy, and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Harold Macmillan, which resulted in the Nassau Agreement, under which the United States agreed to provide Polaris missiles to the United Kingdom instead.

The Polaris Sales Agreement provided for the implementation of the Nassau Agreement. The United States would supply the United Kingdom with Polaris missiles, launch tubes, and the fire control system. The United Kingdom would manufacture the warheads and submarines. In return, the US was given certain assurances by the United Kingdom regarding the use of the missile, but not a veto on the use of British nuclear weapons. The British Polaris ballistic missile submarines were built on time and under budget, and came to be seen as a credible deterrent.

Along with the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement, the Polaris Sales Agreement became a pillar of the nuclear Special Relationship between Britain and the United States. The agreement was amended in 1982 to provide for the sale of the Trident missile system.

==Background==

During the early part of the Second World War, Britain had a nuclear weapons project, codenamed Tube Alloys. In August 1943, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill and the President of the United States, Franklin Roosevelt, signed the Quebec Agreement, which merged Tube Alloys with the American Manhattan Project. The British government trusted that the United States would continue to share nuclear technology, which it regarded as a joint discovery, but the 1946 McMahon Act ended cooperation. Fearing a resurgence of United States isolationism, and Britain losing its great power status, the British government restarted its own development effort, now codenamed High Explosive Research. The first British atomic bomb was tested in Operation Hurricane on 3 October 1952. The subsequent British development of the hydrogen bomb, and a favourable international relations climate created by the Sputnik crisis, led to the McMahon Act being amended in 1958, and the restoration of the nuclear Special Relationship in the form of the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement (MDA), which allowed Britain to acquire nuclear weapons systems from the United States.

Britain&#x27;s nuclear weapons armament was initially based on free-fall bombs delivered by the V bombers of the Royal Air Force (RAF), but the possibility of the crewed bomber becoming obsolete by the late 1960s due to improvements in anti-aircraft defences was foreseen. In 1953, work began on a medium-range ballistic missile (MRBM) called Blue Streak, but by 1958, there were concerns about the vulnerability of this liquid-propellant-missile to a pre-emptive nuclear strike. To extend the effectiveness and operational life of the V bombers, an air-launched, rocket-propelled standoff missile called Blue Steel was developed, but it was anticipated that the air defences of the Soviet Union would improve to the extent that V bombers might still find it difficult to attack their targets. A solution appeared to be the American Skybolt missile, which combined the range of Blue Streak with the mobile basing of the Blue Steel, and was small enough that two could be carried on an Avro Vulcan bomber.

An institutional challenge to Skybolt came from the United States Navy, which was developing a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), the UGM-27 Polaris. The US Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, kept the First Sea Lord, Lord Mountbatten, apprised of its development. By moving the deterrent out to sea, Polaris offered the prospect of a deterrent that was invulnerable to a first strike, and reduced the risk of a nuclear strike on the British Isles. The British Nuclear Deterrent Study Group (BNDSG) produced a study that argued that SLBM technology was as yet unproven, that Polaris would be expensive, and that given the time it would take to build the boats, it could not be deployed before the early 1970s. The Cabinet Defence Committee therefore approved the acquisition of Skybolt in February 1960. The Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, met with the President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, in March 1960, and secured permission to buy Skybolt. In return, the Americans could base the US Navy&#x27;s Polaris ballistic missile submarines in the Holy Loch in Scotland. The financial arrangement was particularly favourable to Britain, as the US was charging only the unit cost of Skybolt, absorbing all the research and development costs. With this agreement in hand, the cancellation of Blue Streak was announced in the House of Commons on 13 April 1960.

The subsequent American decision to cancel Skybolt created a political crisis in the UK, and an emergency meeting between Macmillan and President John F. Kennedy was called in Nassau, Bahamas. Macmillan rejected the US offers of paying half the cost of developing Skybolt, and of supplying the AGM-28 Hound Dog missile instead. This brought options down to Polaris, but the Americans would only supply it on condition that it be used as part of a proposed Multilateral Force (MLF). Kennedy ultimately relented, and agreed to supply Britain with Polaris missiles, while &quot;the Prime Minister made it clear that except where Her Majesty&#x27;s Government may decide that supreme national interests are at stake, these British forces will be used for the purposes of international defence of the Western Alliance in all circumstances.&quot; A joint statement to this effect, the Nassau Agreement, was issued on 21 December 1962.

==Negotiations==

With the Nassau Agreement in hand, it remained to work out the details. Vice Admiral Michael Le Fanu had a meeting with the United States Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara, on 21 December 1962, the final day of the Nassau conference. He found McNamara eager to help, and enthusiastic about the idea of Polaris costing as little as possible. The first issue identified was how many Polaris boats should be built. While the Vulcans to carry Skybolt were already in service, the submarines to carry Polaris were not, and there was no provision in the defence budget for them. Some naval officers feared that their construction would adversely impact the hunter-killer submarine programme. The First Sea Lord, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Caspar John, denounced the &quot;millstone of Polaris hung around our necks&quot; as &quot;potential wreckers of the real navy&quot;.

The number of missiles required was based on substituting for Skybolt. To achieve the same capability, the BNDSG calculated that this would require eight Polaris submarines, each of which would have 16 missiles, for a total of 128 missiles, with 128 one-megaton warheads. It was subsequently decided to halve this, based on the decision that the ability to destroy twenty Soviet cities would have nearly as great a deterrent effect as the ability to destroy forty. The Admiralty considered the possibility of hybrid submarines that could operate as hunter-killers while carrying eight Polaris missiles, but McNamara noted that this would be inefficient, as twice as many submarines would need to be on station to maintain the deterrent, and cautioned that the effect of tinkering with the US Navy&#x27;s 16-missile layout was unpredictable. The Treasury costed a four-boat Polaris fleet at £314 million by 1972/73. A Cabinet Defence Committee meeting on 23 January 1963 approved the plan for four boats, with Thorneycroft noting that four boats would be cheaper and faster to build.

A mission led by Sir Solly Zuckerman, the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence, left for the United States to discuss Polaris on 8 January 1963. It included the Vice Chief of the Naval Staff, Vice Admiral Sir Varyl Begg; the Deputy Secretary of the Admiralty, James Mackay; Rear Admiral Hugh Mackenzie; and physicist Sir Robert Cockburn and F. J. Doggett from the Ministry of Aviation. That the involvement of the Ministry of Aviation might be a complicating factor was foreseen, but it had experience with nuclear weapons development. Mackenzie had been the Flag Officer Submarines until 31 December 1962, when Le Fanu had appointed him the Chief Polaris Executive (CPE). As such, he was directly answerable to Le Fanu as Controller of the Navy. His CPE staff was divided between London and Foxhill, near Bath, Somerset, where Royal Navy had its ship design, logistics and weapons groups. It was intended as a counterpart to the United States Navy Special Projects Office (SPO), with whom it would have to deal.

The principal finding of the Zuckerman mission was that the Americans had developed a new version of the Polaris missile, the A3. With a range extended of , it had a new weapons bay housing three re-entry vehicles (REBs or Re-Entry Bodies in US Navy parlance) and a new W58 warhead to penetrate improved Soviet anti-missile defences expected to become available around 1970. A decision was therefore required on whether to purchase the old A2 missile or the new A3. The Zuckerman mission came out in favour of the new A3 missile, although it was still under development and not expected to enter service until August 1964, as the deterrent would remain credible for much longer. The decision was endorsed by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Carrington, in May 1963, and was officially made by Thorneycroft on 10 June 1963.

The choice of the A3 created a problem for the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (AWRE) at Aldermaston, for the Skybolt warhead that had recently been tested in the Tendrac nuclear test at the Nevada Test Site in the United States would require a redesigned Re-Entry System (RES) in order to be fitted to a Polaris missile, at an estimated cost of between £30 million and £40 million. The alternative was to make a British copy of the W58. While the AWRE was familiar with the W47 warhead used in the A2, it knew nothing of the W58. A presidential determination was required to release information on the W58 under the MDA, but with this in hand, a mission led by John Challens, the Chief of Warhead Development at the AWRE, visited the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory from 22 to 24 January 1963, and was shown details of the W58.
The Zuckerman mission found the SPO helpful and forthcoming, but there was one major shock. The British were expected to contribute to the research and development costs of the A3, backdated to 1 January 1963. These were expected to top $700 million by 1968. Skybolt had been offered to the UK at unit cost, with the US absorbing the research and development costs, but no such agreement had been reached at Nassau for Polaris. Thorneycroft baulked at the prospect of paying research and development costs, but McNamara pointed out that the United States Congress would not stand for an agreement that placed all the burden on the United States. Macmillan instructed the British Ambassador to the United States, Sir David Ormsby-Gore, to inform Kennedy that Britain was not willing to commit to an open-ended sharing of research and development costs, but, as a compromise, would pay an additional five per cent for each missile. He asked that Kennedy be informed that a breakdown of the Nassau Agreement would likely cause the fall of his government. Ormsby-Gore met with Kennedy that very day, and while Kennedy noted that the five per cent offer &quot;was not the most generous offer he had ever heard of&quot;, he accepted it. McNamara, certain that the United States was being ripped off, calculated the five per cent on top of not just the missiles, but their fire control and navigation systems as well, adding around £2 million to the bill. On Ormsby-Gore&#x27;s advice, this formulation was accepted.

An American mission now visited the United Kingdom. This was led by Paul H. Nitze, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, and included Walt W. Rostow, the Director of Policy Planning at the State Department, and Admiral Ignatius J. Galantin, the head of the SPO. The Americans had ideas about how the programme should be organised. They foresaw the UK Polaris programme having project officers from both countries, with a Joint Steering Task Group that met regularly to provide advice. This was accepted, and would become part of the final agreement. However, a follow-up British mission under Leslie Williams, the Director General Atomic Weapons at the Ministry of Aviation, whose members included Challens and Rear Admiral Frederick Dossor, was given a letter by the SPO with a list of subjects that were off limits. These included penetration aids, which were held to be outside the scope of the Nassau Agreement.

One remaining obstacle in the path of the programme was how it would be integrated with the MLF. The British response to the MLF concept &quot;ranged from unenthusiastic to hostile throughout the military establishment and in the two principal political parties&quot;. Apart from anything else, it was estimated to cost as much as £100 million over ten years. Nonetheless, the Foreign Office argued that Britain must support the MLF. The Nassau Agreement had invigorated the MLF effort in the United States. Kennedy appointed Livingston T. Merchant to negotiate the MLF with the European governments, which he did in February and March 1963. While reaffirming support for those parts of the Nassau Agreement concerning the MLF, the British were successful in getting them omitted from the Polaris Sales Agreement.
The British team completed drafting the agreement in March 1963, and copies were circulated for discussion. The contracts for their construction were announced that month. The Polaris boats would be the largest submarines built in Britain up to that time, and would be built by Vickers Armstrong Shipbuilders in Barrow-in-Furness and Cammell Laird in Birkenhead. For similar reasons to the US Navy, the Royal Navy decided to base the boats at Faslane, on the Gareloch, not far from the US Navy&#x27;s base on the Holy Loch. The drawback of the site was that it isolated the Polaris boats from the rest of the navy. The Polaris Sales Agreement was signed in Washington, D.C., on 6 April 1963 by Ormsby-Gore and Dean Rusk, the United States Secretary of State.

==Outcome==

The two liaison officers were appointed in April; Captain Peter la Niece became the Royal Navy project officer in Washington, D.C., while Captain Phil Rollings became the US Navy project officer in London. The Joint Steering Task Group held its first meeting in Washington on 26 June 1963. The shipbuilding programme would prove to be a remarkable achievement, with the four submarines built on time and within the budget. The first boat, was launched in September 1966, and commenced its first deterrent patrol in June 1968. The annual running costs of the Polaris boats came to around two per cent of the defence budget, and they came to be seen as a credible deterrent that enhanced Britain&#x27;s international status. Along with the more celebrated 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement, the Polaris Sales Agreement became a pillar of the nuclear Special Relationship between Britain and the United States.

==Trident==

The Polaris Sales Agreement provided an established framework for negotiations over missiles and re-entry systems. The legal agreement took the form of amending the Polaris Sales Agreement through an exchange of notes between the two governments so that &quot;Polaris&quot; in the original now also covered the purchase of Trident. There were also some amendments to the classified annexes of the Polaris Sales Agreement to delete the exclusion of penetrating aids. Under the Polaris Sales Agreement, the United Kingdom paid a five per cent levy on the cost of equipment supplied in recognition of US research and development costs already incurred. For Trident, a payment of $116 million was substituted. The United Kingdom procured the Trident system from America and fitted them to their own submarines, which had only 16 missile tubes like Polaris rather than the 24 in the American . The first , , entered operational service in December 1994, by which time the Cold War had ended.

<text>The Proto-Indo-Europeans are a hypothetical prehistoric ethnolinguistic group of Eurasia who spoke Proto-Indo-European (PIE), the reconstructed common ancestor of the Indo-European language family.
Knowledge of them comes chiefly from that linguistic reconstruction, along with material evidence from archaeology and archaeogenetics. The Proto-Indo-Europeans likely lived during the Late Neolithic period (6,400–3,500 BC). Mainstream scholars place them in the Pontic–Caspian steppe across Eurasia (this steppe extends from northeastern Bulgaria and southeastern Romania, through Moldova, and southern and eastern Ukraine, through the Northern Caucasus of southern Russia, and into the Lower Volga region of western Kazakhstan, adjacent to the Kazakh steppe to the east, both forming part of the larger Eurasian Steppe). Some archaeologists would extend the time depth of PIE to the Middle Neolithic period (5500 to 4500 BC) or even the Early Neolithic period (7500 to 5500 BC) and suggest alternative origin hypotheses.

By the early second millennium BC, descendants of the Proto-Indo-Europeans had reached far and wide across Eurasia, including Anatolia (Hittites), the Aegean (the linguistic ancestors of Mycenaean Greece), the north of Europe (Corded Ware culture), the edges of Central Asia (Yamnaya culture), and southern Siberia (Afanasievo culture).

== Definition ==
In the words of philologist Martin L. West, &quot;If there was an Indo-European language, it follows that there was a people who spoke it: not a people in the sense of a nation, for they may never have formed a political unity, and not a people in any racial sense, for they may have been as genetically mixed as any modern population defined by language. If our language is a descendant of theirs, that does not make them ‘our ancestors’, any more than the ancient Romans are the ancestors of the French, the Romanians, and the Brazilians. The Indo-Europeans were a people in the sense of a linguistic community. We should probably think of them as a loose network of clans and tribes, inhabiting a coherent territory of limited size.&quot;

While &quot;Proto-Indo-Europeans&quot; is used in scholarship to designate the group of speakers associated with the reconstructed proto-language and culture, the term &quot;Indo-Europeans&quot; may refer to any historical people that speak an Indo-European language.

==Culture==

Using linguistic reconstruction from old Indo-European languages such as Latin and Sanskrit, hypothetical features of the Proto-Indo-European language are deduced. Assuming that these linguistic features reflect culture and environment of the Proto-Indo-Europeans, the following cultural and environmental traits are widely proposed:
* pastoralism, including domesticated cattle, horses, and dogs
* agriculture and cereal cultivation, including technology commonly ascribed to late-neolithic farming communities, e.g., the plow
* transportation by or across water
* the solid wheel, used for wagons, but not yet chariots with spoked wheels
* worship of a sky god, &quot;*Dyḗus Ph2tḗr&quot; (lit. &quot;sky father&quot;; &gt; Vedic Sanskrit &quot;Dyáuṣ Pitṛ́&quot;, Ancient Greek &quot;Ζεύς (πατήρ) / Zeus (patēr)&quot;), vocative &quot;*dyeu ph2ter&quot; (&gt; Latin &quot;Iūpiter&quot;, Illyrian &quot;Deipaturos&quot;)
* oral heroic poetry or song lyrics that used stock phrases such as &quot;imperishable fame&quot; (&quot;*ḱléwos ń̥dʰgʷʰitom&quot;) and the &quot;wheel of the sun&quot; (&quot;*sh₂uens kʷekʷlos&quot;).
* a patrilineal kinship-system based upon relationships between men

A 2016 phylogenetic analysis of Indo-European folktales posits that one folktale, &quot;The Smith and the Devil&quot;, can be reconstructed to the Proto-Indo-European period. This story, found in contemporary Indo-European folktales from Scandinavia to India, describes a blacksmith who offers his soul to a malevolent being (commonly a devil in modern versions of the tale) in exchange for the ability to weld any kind of materials together. The blacksmith then uses his new ability to stick the devil to an immovable object (often a tree), thus avoiding his end of the bargain. According to the authors, the reconstruction of this folktale to PIE implies that the Proto-Indo-Europeans had metallurgy, which in turn &quot;suggests a plausible context for the cultural evolution of a tale about a cunning smith who attains a superhuman level of mastery over his craft&quot;.

==History of research==
Researchers have made many attempts to identify particular prehistoric cultures with the Proto-Indo-European-speaking peoples, but all of such theories remain speculative.

The scholars of the 1800s who first tackled the question of the Indo-Europeans&#x27; original homeland (also called &quot;Urheimat&quot;, from German), had essentially only linguistic evidence. They attempted a rough localization by reconstructing the names of plants and animals (importantly the beech and the salmon) as well as the culture and technology (a bronze-age culture that was centered upon animal husbandry and having domesticated the horse). The scholarly opinions became basically divided between a European hypothesis, which positted a migration from Europe to Asia, and an Asian hypothesis, which positted that the migration took place in the opposite direction.

In the early 1900s, the question became associated with the expansion of a supposed &quot;aryan race&quot;, a now-discredited theory that was promoted during the expansion of European empires and the rise of &quot;scientific racism&quot;. The question remains contentious within some flavours of ethnic nationalism (see also Indigenous Aryans).

A series of major advances occurred in the 1970s due to the convergence of several factors. First, the radiocarbon dating method (invented in 1949) had become sufficiently inexpensive to be applied on a mass scale. Through dendrochronology (tree-ring dating), pre-historians could calibrate radiocarbon dates to a much higher degree of accuracy. And finally, before the 1970s, parts of eastern Europe and central Asia had been off-limits to Western scholars, while non-Western archaeologists did not have access to publication in Western peer-reviewed journals. The pioneering work of Marija Gimbutas, assisted by Colin Renfrew, at least partly addressed this problem by organizing expeditions and arranging for more academic collaboration between Western and non-Western scholars.

The Kurgan hypothesis, which is the most widely held theory as of 2017, depends upon linguistic and archaeological evidence, but is not universally accepted. It posits that the PIEs originated in the Pontic–Caspian steppe during the chalcolithic age. A minority of scholars prefer the Anatolian hypothesis, which posits an origin in Anatolia during the neolithic age. Other theories (Armenian hypothesis, Out of India theory, paleolithic continuity theory, and Balkan hypothesis) have only marginal scholarly support.

In regard to terminology, in the 19th and early 20th centuries, the term &quot;Aryan&quot; was used to refer to the Proto-Indo-Europeans and their descendants. However, &quot;Aryan&quot; more properly applies to the Indo-Iranians, the Indo-European branch that settled parts of the Middle East and South Asia, as only Indic and Iranian languages explicitly affirm the term as a self-designation referring to the entirety of their people, whereas the same Proto-Indo-European root (*aryo-) is the basis for Greek and Germanic word forms which seem only to denote the ruling elite of Proto-Indo-European (PIE) society. In fact, the most accessible evidence available confirms only the existence of a common, but vague, socio-cultural designation of &quot;nobility&quot; associated with PIE society, such that Greek socio-cultural lexicon and Germanic proper names derived from this root remain insufficient to determine whether the concept was limited to the designation of an exclusive, socio-political elite, or whether it could possibly have been applied in the most inclusive sense to an inherent and ancestral &quot;noble&quot; quality which allegedly characterized all ethnic members of PIE society. Only the latter could have served as a true and universal self-designation for the Proto-Indo-European people.

By the early 1900s, the term &quot;aryan&quot; had come to be widely used in a racial sense, in which it referred to a hypothesized white, blond, and blue-eyed superior race. The dictator Adolf Hitler called this race the &quot;master race&quot; (&quot;Herrenrasse&quot;), and, in its name, led massive pogroms in Europe. Subsequently, the term &quot;Aryan&quot; as a general term for Indo-Europeans has been largely abandoned by scholars (though the term &quot;Indo-Aryan&quot; is still used to refer to the branch that settled in Southern Asia).

==Urheimat hypotheses==


According to some archaeologists, PIE speakers cannot be assumed to have been a single, identifiable people or tribe, but were a group of loosely-related populations that were ancestral to the later, still partially prehistoric, Bronze Age Indo-Europeans. This is believed especially by those archaeologists who posit an original homeland of vast extent and immense time depth. However, this belief is not shared by most linguists, because proto-languages, like all languages before modern transport and communication, occupied small geographical areas over a limited time span, and were spoken by a set of close-knit communities– a tribe in the broad sense.

Researchers have put forward a great variety of proposed locations for the first speakers of Proto-Indo-European. Few of these hypotheses have survived scrutiny by academic specialists in Indo-European studies sufficiently well to be included in modern academic debate.

===Pontic-Caspian steppe hypothesis===

The Kurgan (or Steppe) hypothesis was first formulated by Otto Schrader (1883) and V. Gordon Childe (1926), and was later systematized by Marija Gimbutas from 1956 onwards. The name originates from the &quot;kurgans&quot; (burial mounds) of the Eurasian steppes. The hypothesis suggests that the Indo-Europeans, a patriarchal, patrilinear, and nomadic culture of the Pontic–Caspian steppe (which is now part northeastern Bulgaria and southeastern Romania, through Moldova, and southern and eastern Ukraine, through the northern Caucasus of southern Russia, and into the lower Volga region of western Kazakhstan), expanded into the area through several waves of migration during the 3rd millennium BCE, coinciding with the taming of the horse. Leaving archaeological signs of their presence (see Corded Ware culture), they subjugated the supposedly peaceful, egalitarian, and matrilinear European neolithic farmers of Gimbutas&#x27; Old Europe. A modified form of this theory, by J. P. Mallory, which dates the migrations to an earlier time (to around 3500 BCE), and puts less insistence upon their violent or quasi-military nature, remains the most widely accepted theory of the Proto-Indo-European expansion.

===Armenian highland hypothesis===

The Armenian hypothesis, based on the glottalic theory, suggests that the Proto-Indo-European language was spoken during the 4th millennium BC in the Armenian Highland. This Indo-Hittite model does not include the Anatolian languages in its scenario. The phonological peculiarities of PIE proposed in the glottalic theory would be best preserved in the Armenian language and the Germanic languages, the former assuming the role of the dialect which remained &quot;in situ&quot;, implied to be particularly archaic in spite of its late attestation. Proto-Greek would be practically equivalent to Mycenean Greek and would date to the 17th century BC, closely associating Greek migration to Greece with the Indo-Aryan migration to India at about the same time (viz., Indo-European expansion at the transition to the Late Bronze Age, including the possibility of Indo-European Kassites). The Armenian hypothesis argues for the latest possible date of Proto-Indo-European (&quot;sans&quot; Anatolian), a full millennium later than the mainstream Kurgan hypothesis. In this, it figures as an opposite to the Anatolian hypothesis, in spite of the geographical proximity of the respective &quot;Urheimaten&quot; suggested, diverging from the time-frame suggested there by a full three millennia.

===Anatolian hypothesis===
The Anatolian hypothesis, notably advocated by Colin Renfrew from the 1980s onwards, proposes that the Indo-European languages spread peacefully into Europe from Anatolia from around 7000 BC with the Neolithic Revolution&#x27;s advance of farming (&quot;wave of advance&quot;). The culture of the Indo-Europeans as inferred by linguistic reconstruction raises difficulties for this theory, since early neolithic cultures lacked the horse, the wheel, and metal – terms for all of which are securely reconstructed for Proto-Indo-European. Renfrew dismisses this argument, comparing such reconstructions to a theory that the presence of the word &quot;café&quot; in all modern Romance languages implies that the ancient Romans had cafés too.

Another argument, made by proponents of the steppe Urheimat (such as David Anthony) against Renfrew, points to the fact that ancient Anatolia is known to have been inhabited in the 2nd millennium BC by non-Indo-European-speaking peoples, namely the Hattians (perhaps North Caucasian-speaking), the Chalybes (language unknown), and the Hurrians (Hurro-Urartian).

Following the publication of several studies on ancient DNA in 2015, Colin Renfrew subsequently acknowledged the important role of migrations of populations speaking one or several Indo-European languages from the Pontic–Caspian steppe towards Northwestern Europe, noting that the DNA evidence from ancient skeletons &quot;had completely rejuvenated Maria Gimbutas&#x27; kurgan hypothesis.&quot;

==Genetics==
Archaeogenetics has allowed the use of genetic analysis to trace migration patterns.

===Kurgan/Steppe hypothesis===
The Kurgan hypothesis or steppe theory is the most widely accepted proposal to identify the Proto-Indo-European homeland from which the Indo-European languages spread out throughout Europe and parts of Asia. It postulates that the people of a Kurgan culture in the Pontic steppe north of the Black Sea were the most likely speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE). The term is derived from the Russian kurgan (курга́н), meaning tumulus or burial mound.

====R1a and R1b====
According to three autosomal DNA studies, haplogroups R1b and R1a, now the most common in Europe (R1a is also very common in South Asia) would have expanded from the Pontic steppes, along with the Indo-European languages; they also detected an autosomal component present in modern Europeans which was not present in Neolithic Europeans, which would have been introduced with paternal lineages R1b and R1a, as well as Indo-European languages. Studies which analysed ancient human remains in Ireland and Portugal suggest that R1b was introduced in these places along with autosomal DNA from the Pontic steppes.

====R1a and R1a1a====
The subclade R1a1a (R-M17 or R-M198) is most commonly associated with Indo-European speakers. Data so far collected indicate that there are two widely separated areas of high frequency, one in Eastern Europe, around Poland, Ukraine, and Russia, and the other in Southern Asia, around the Indo-Gangetic Plain, which is part of India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. The historical and prehistoric possible reasons for this are the subject of on-going discussion and attention amongst population geneticists and genetic genealogists, and are considered to be of potential interest to linguists and archaeologists also.

A large, 2014 study by Underhill et al., using 16,244 individuals from over 126 populations from across Eurasia, concluded there was compelling evidence, that R1a-M420 originated in the vicinity of Iran. The mutations that characterize haplogroup R1a occurred ~10,000 years BP. Its defining mutation (M17) occurred about 10,000 to 14,000 years ago. Pamjav et al. (2012) believe that R1a originated and initially diversified either within the Eurasian Steppes or the Middle East and Caucasus region.

Ornella Semino et al. propose a postglacial (Holocene) spread of the R1a1 haplogroup from north of the Black Sea during the time of the Late Glacial Maximum, which was subsequently magnified by the expansion of the Kurgan culture into Europe and eastward.

====Yamnaya culture====
According to Jones et al. (2015) and , autosomal tests indicate that the Yamnaya-people were the result of admixture between &quot;Eastern Hunter-Gatherers&quot; from eastern Europe (EHG) and &quot;Caucasus hunter-gatherers&quot; (CHG).
Each of those two populations contributed about half the Yamnaya DNA. According to co-author Dr. Andrea Manica of the University of Cambridge: 
All Yamnaya individuals sampled by Haak et al. (2015) belonged to the Y-haplogroup R1b.

Based on these findings and by equating the people of the Yamnaya culture with the Proto-Indo-Europeans, David W. Anthony (2019) suggests that the Proto-Indo-European language formed mainly from a base of languages spoken by Eastern European hunter-gathers with influences from languages of northern Caucasus hunter-gatherers, in addition to a possible later influence from the language of the Maikop culture to the south (which is hypothesized to have belonged to the North Caucasian family) in the later neolithic or Bronze Age involving little genetic impact.

=====Eastern European hunter-gatherers=====
According to , &quot;Eastern European hunter-gatherers&quot; who inhabited Russia were a distinctive population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a ~24,000-year-old Siberian from the Mal&#x27;ta-Buret&#x27; culture, or other, closely related Ancient North Eurasian (ANE) people from Siberia and to the Western Hunter-Gatherers (WHG). Remains of the &quot;Eastern European hunter-gatherers&quot; have been found in Mesolithic or early Neolithic sites in Karelia and Samara Oblast, Russia, and put under analysis. Three such hunter-gathering individuals of the male sex have had their DNA results published. Each was found to belong to a different Y-DNA haplogroup: R1a, R1b, and J. R1b is also the most common Y-DNA haplogroup found among both the Yamnaya and modern-day Western Europeans. R1a is more common in Eastern Europeans and in the northern parts of the Indian subcontinent.

=====Near East population=====
The Near East population were most likely hunter-gatherers from the Caucasus (CHG) c.q. Iran Chalcolithic related people with a major CHG-component.

Jones et al. (2015) analyzed genomes from males from western Georgia, in the Caucasus, from the Late Upper Palaeolithic (13,300 years old) and the Mesolithic (9,700 years old). These two males carried Y-DNA haplogroup: J* and J2a. The researchers found that these Caucasus hunters were probably the source of the farmer-like DNA in the Yamnaya, as the Caucasians were distantly related to the Middle Eastern people who introduced farming in Europe. Their genomes showed that a continued mixture of the Caucasians with Middle Eastern took place up to 25,000 years ago, when the coldest period in the last Ice Age started.

According to Lazaridis et al. (2016), &quot;a population related to the people of the Iran Chalcolithic contributed ~43% of the ancestry of early Bronze Age populations of the steppe.&quot; According to Lazaridis et al. (2016), these Iranian Chalcolithic people were a mixture of &quot;the Neolithic people of western Iran, the Levant, and Caucasus Hunter Gatherers.&quot; Lazaridis et al. (2016) also note that farming spread at two places in the Near East, namely the Levant and Iran, from where it spread, Iranian people spreading to the steppe and south Asia.

====Northern and Central Europe====

 studied DNA from 94 skeletons from Europe and Russia aged between 3,000 and 8,000 years old. They concluded that about 4,500 years ago there was a major influx into Europe of Yamnaya culture people originating from the Pontic–Caspian steppe north of the Black Sea and that the DNA of copper-age Europeans matched that of the Yamnaya.

====Bronze Age Greeks====
A 2017 archaeogenetics study of Mycenaean and Minoan remains published in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; concluded that the Mycenaean Greeks were genetically closely related with the Minoans but unlike the Minoans also had a 13–18% genetic contribution from Bronze Age steppe populations.

===Anatolian hypothesis===
Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza and Alberto Piazza argue that Renfrew and Gimbutas reinforce rather than contradict each other. states that &quot;It is clear that, genetically speaking, peoples of the Kurgan steppe descended at least in part from people of the Middle Eastern Neolithic who immigrated there from Turkey.&quot; state that:
Spencer Wells suggests in a 2001 study that the origin, distribution and age of the R1a1 haplotype points to an ancient migration, possibly corresponding to the spread by the Kurgan people in their expansion across the Eurasian steppe around 3000 BC.

About his old teacher Cavalli-Sforza&#x27;s proposal, states that &quot;there is nothing to contradict this model, although the genetic patterns do not provide clear support either&quot;, and instead argues that the evidence is much stronger for Gimbutas&#x27; model:
===Iranian/Armenian hypothesis===
David Reich (2018), noting the presence of some Indo-European languages (such as Hittite) in parts of ancient Anatolia, argues that &quot;the most likely location of the population that first spoke an Indo-European language was south of the Caucasus Mountains, perhaps in present-day Iran or Armenia, because ancient DNA from people who lived there matches what we would expect for a source population both for the Yamnaya and for ancient Anatolians.&quot; Yet, Reich also notes that &quot;...the evidence here is circumstantial as no ancient DNA from the Hittites themselves has yet been published.&quot; Kristian Kristiansen, in an interview with &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; in May 2018, stated that the Yamnaya culture may have had a predecessor at the Caucasus, where &quot;proto-proto-Indo-European&quot; was spoken.

Recent DNA-research has led to renewed suggestions of a Caucasian homeland for the &#x27;proto-Indo-Europeans&#x27;. According to Kroonen et al. (2018) and Damgaard et al. (2018), ancient Anatolia &quot;show no indication of a large-scale intrusion of a steppe population.&quot; They further note that this lends support to the Indo-Hittite hypothesis, according to which both proto-Anatolian and proto-Indo-European split-off from a common mother language &quot;no later than the 4th millennium BCE.&quot; states that &quot;the Armenian plateau hypothesis gains in plausibility&quot; since the Yamnaya partly descended from a Near Eastern population, which resembles present-day Armenians.&quot;

Wang et al. (2018) note that the Caucasus served as a corridor for gene flow between the steppe and cultures south of the Caucasus during the Eneolithic and the Bronze Age, stating that this &quot;opens up the possibility of a homeland of PIE south of the Caucasus.&quot; However, Wang et al. also comment that the most recent genetic evidence supports an expansion of proto-Indo-Europeans through the steppe, noting: &quot;but the latest ancient DNA results from South Asia also lend weight to a spread of Indo-European languages &quot;via the steppe belt. The spread of some or all of the proto-Indo-European branches would have been possible via the North Caucasus and Pontic region and from there, along with pastoralist expansions, to the heart of Europe. This scenario finds support from the well attested and now widely documented &#x27;steppe ancestry&#x27; in European populations, the postulate of increasingly patrilinear societies in the wake of these expansions (exemplified by R1a/R1b), as attested in the latest study on the Bell Beaker phenomenon.&quot;

David W. Anthony in a 2019 analysis, criticizes the &quot;southern&quot; or &quot;Armenian&quot; hypothesis (addressing Reich, Kristiansen, and Wang). Among his reasons being: that the Yamnaya lack evidence of genetic influence from the Bronze Age or late neolithic Caucasus (deriving instead from an earlier mixture of Eastern European hunter-gatherers and Caucasus hunter-gatherers) and have paternal lineages that seem to derive from the hunter-gatherers of the Eastern European Steppe rather than the Caucasus, as well as a scarcity in the Yamnaya of the Anatolian Farmer admixture that had become common and substantial in the Caucasus around 5,000 BC. Anthony instead suggests a genetic and linguistic origin of proto-Indo-Europeans (the Yamnaya) in the Eastern European steppe north of the Caucasus, from a mixture of these two groups (EHG and CHG). He suggests that the roots of Proto-Indo-European (&quot;archaic&quot; or proto-proto-Indo-European) were in the steppe rather than the south and that PIE formed mainly from a base of languages spoken by Eastern European hunter-gathers with some influences from languages of Caucasus hunter-gatherers.

<text>Peter Mark Roget ( ; 18 January 1779 – 12 September 1869) was a British physician, natural theologian, lexicographer, and founding secretary of The Portico Library. He is best known for publishing, in 1852, the &quot;Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases&quot;, a classified collection of related words (thesaurus). In 1824, he read a paper to the Royal Society about a peculiar optical illusion which is often (falsely) regarded as the origin of the ancient persistence of vision theory that was later commonly, yet incorrectly, used to explain apparent motion in film and animation.

==Early life==

Peter Mark Roget was born in Broad Street, Soho, London, the son of Jean (John) Roget (1751–1783), a Genevan cleric born to French parents, and Catherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Romilly, the sister of British politician, abolitionist, and legal reformer Sir Samuel Romilly. His parents were French Huguenots. Following his father&#x27;s death, the family moved to Edinburgh in 1783 where Roget later studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating in 1798. Samuel Romilly, who took on the role of surrogate father to Roget and supported his nephew&#x27;s education, also introduced him into Whig social circles.

Roget then attended lectures at London medical schools. Living in Clifton, Bristol, from 1798 to 1799, he knew Thomas Beddoes and Humphry Davy and frequented the Pneumatic Institute.

Not making a quick start to a medical career, in 1802 Roget took a position as a tutor to the sons of John Leigh Philips, with whom he began a Grand Tour during the Peace of Amiens, travelling with a friend, Lovell Edgeworth, son of Richard Lovell Edgeworth. When the Peace abruptly ended he was detained as a prisoner in Geneva. He was able to bring his pupils back to England in late 1803, but Edgeworth was held in captivity until Napoleon fell on 6 April 1814.

==Medical career==
With the help of Samuel Romilly, Roget became a private physician to William Petty, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne, who died in 1805. He then succeeded Thomas Percival at Manchester Infirmary and began to lecture on physiology. He moved to London in 1808 and in 1809 became a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians. After an extended period of dispensary work and lecturing, in particular, at the Russell Institution and Royal Institution, he was taken onto the staff of the Queen Charlotte Hospital in 1817. He also lectured at the London Institution and the Windmill Street School.

In 1823 Roget and Peter Mere Latham were brought in to investigate disease at Millbank Penitentiary. In 1828 Roget, with William Thomas Brande and Thomas Telford, submitted a report on London&#x27;s water supply. In 1834 he became the first Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution. One of those who helped found the University of London in 1837, he was an examiner in physiology there. He gave up medical practice in 1840.

==Thesaurus==

Roget retired from professional life in 1840, and by 1846 was working on the book that perpetuates his memory today. It has been claimed that Roget struggled with depression for most of his life, and that the thesaurus arose partly from an effort to battle it. A biographer stated that his obsession with list-making as a coping mechanism was well established by the time Roget was eight years old. In 1805, he began to maintain a notebook classification scheme for words, organized by meaning. During this period he also moved to Manchester, where he became the first secretary of the Portico Library.

The catalogue of words was first printed in 1852, titled &quot;Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases Classified and Arranged so as to Facilitate the Expression of Ideas and Assist in Literary Composition&quot;. During Roget&#x27;s lifetime, the work had twenty-eight printings. After his death, it was revised and expanded by his son, John Lewis Roget (1828–1908), and later by John&#x27;s son, the engineer Samuel Romilly Roget (1875–1953). Roget&#x27;s private library was put up for auction in 1870 at Sotheby&#x27;s and its catalogue has been analyzed.

==Other interests==

Roget was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1815, in recognition of a paper on a slide rule with a loglog scale. He was a secretary of the Society from 1827 to 1848. On 9 December 1824, Roget presented a paper on a peculiar optical illusion to the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot;, which was published in 1825, as &quot;Explanation of an optical deception in the appearance of the spokes of a wheel when seen through vertical apertures.&quot; The paper was noted by Michael Faraday and by Joseph Plateau, who both mentioned it in their articles that presented new illusions with apparent motion. It has often been heralded as the basis for the persistence of vision theory, which has for a long time been falsely regarded as the principle causing the perception of motion in animation and film. In 1834, Roget claimed to have invented &quot;the Phantasmascope or Phenakisticope&quot; in the spring of 1831, a few years before Plateau introduced that first stroboscopic animation device.

One of the promoters of the Medical and Chirurgical Society of London, of which he was the President in 1829, and which later became the Royal Society of Medicine, Roget was also a founder of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, writing a series of popular manuals for it. He wrote numerous papers on physiology and health, among them the fifth &quot;Bridgewater Treatise&quot;, &quot;Animal and Vegetable Physiology considered with reference to Natural Theology&quot; (1834), and articles for the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. He was hostile to phrenology, writing against it in a &quot;Britannica&quot; supplement in 1818, and devoting a two-volume work to it (1838).

A chess player, in an article in the &quot;London and Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine&quot; Roget solved the general open knight&#x27;s tour problem. He composed chess problems, and designed an inexpensive pocket chessboard.

==Personal life==
In 1818 Roget was called by the family to the home of Samuel Romilly following the death of his wife, Lady Romilly. Roget&#x27;s uncle and surrogate father committed suicide by cutting his throat, dying in Roget&#x27;s presence.

===Family===
In 1824 Roget married Mary Taylor, the daughter of Jonathan Hobson. They had a son, John Lewis (1828–1908), and a daughter, Kate.

===Later life===
In later life Roget became deaf and was cared for by his daughter, Kate. He died aged 90 while on holiday in West Malvern, Worcestershire and was laid to rest in St. James Church cemetery, West Malvern. There is a memorial to him at his local parish church of St Mary on Paddington Green Church.

==In literature==
Canadian writer Keath Fraser published a story, &quot;Roget&#x27;s Thesaurus&quot;, in 1982, which is narrated in Roget&#x27;s voice. He has Roget speak on his wife&#x27;s death, from cancer.

Roget also appears in Shelagh Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;An Experiment with an Air Pump&quot;, set in 1799, as the only historical character. The play is set in the fictional household of Joseph Fenwick, and Roget is one of Fenwick&#x27;s assistants.

A picture-book biography of Roget entitled &quot;The Right Word: Roget and His Thesaurus&quot; was published by Eerdmans Books in 2014. It was named a Caldecott Honor book for excellence in illustration and won the Sibert Medal for excellence in children&#x27;s nonfiction.

<text>Pterodactylus (from ) is a genus of extinct pterosaurs. It is thought to contain only a single species, Pterodactylus antiquus, which was the first pterosaur to be named and identified as a flying reptile and one of the first prehistoric reptiles to ever be discovered.

Fossil remains of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; have primarily been found in the Solnhofen limestone of Bavaria, Germany, which dates from the Late Jurassic period (Tithonian stage), about 150.8 to 148.5 million years ago. More fragmentary remains of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; have tentatively been identified from elsewhere in Europe and in Africa.

&quot;Pterodactylus&quot; was a generalist carnivore that probably fed on a variety of invertebrates and vertebrates. Like all pterosaurs, &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; had wings formed by a skin and muscle membrane stretching from its elongated fourth finger to its hind limbs. It was supported internally by collagen fibres and externally by keratinous ridges. &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; was a small pterosaur compared to other famous genera such as &quot;Pteranodon&quot; and &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;, and it also lived earlier, during the Late Jurassic period, while both &quot;Pteranodon&quot; and &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; lived during the Late Cretaceous. &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; lived alongside other small pterosaurs such as the well-known &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot;, as well as other genera such as &quot;Scaphognathus&quot;, &quot;Anurognathus&quot; and &quot;Ctenochasma&quot;. &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; is classified as an early-branching member of the ctenochasmatid lineage, within the pterosaur clade Pterodactyloidea.

==Discovery and history==

The type specimen of the animal now known as &quot;Pterodactylus antiquus&quot; was the first pterosaur fossil ever to be identified. The first &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; specimen was described by the Italian scientist in 1784, based on a fossil skeleton that had been unearthed from the Solnhofen limestone of Bavaria. Collini was the curator of the , or nature cabinet of curiosities (a precursor to the modern concept of the natural history museum), in the palace of Charles Theodore, Elector of Bavaria at Mannheim. The specimen had been given to the collection by Count around 1780, having been recovered from a lithographic limestone quarry in . The actual date of the specimen&#x27;s discovery and entry into the collection is unknown however, and it was not mentioned in a catalogue of the collection taken in 1767, so it must have been acquired at some point between that date and its 1784 description by Collini. This makes it potentially the earliest documented pterosaur find; the &quot;Pester Exemplar&quot; of the genus &quot;Aurorazhdarcho&quot; was described in 1779 and possibly discovered earlier than the Mannheim specimen, but it was at first considered to be a fossilized crustacean, and it was not until 1856 that this species was properly described as a pterosaur by German paleontologist .

In his first description of the Mannheim specimen, Collini did not conclude that it was a flying animal. In fact, Collini could not fathom what kind of animal it might have been, rejecting affinities with the birds or the bats. He speculated that it may have been a sea creature, not for any anatomical reason, but because he thought the ocean depths were more likely to have housed unknown types of animals. The idea that pterosaurs were aquatic animals persisted among a minority of scientists as late as 1830, when the German zoologist Johann Georg Wagler published a text on &quot;amphibians&quot; which included an illustration of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; using its wings as flippers. Wagler went so far as to classify &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, along with other aquatic vertebrates (namely plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and monotremes), in the class Gryphi, between birds and mammals.

The German/French scientist Johann Hermann was the one who first stated that &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; used its long fourth finger to support a wing membrane. Back in March 1800, Hermann alerted the prominent French scientist Georges Cuvier to the existence of Collini&#x27;s fossil, believing that it had been captured by the invading forces of the French Consulate and sent to collections in Paris (and perhaps to Cuvier himself) as war booty; at the time special French political commissars systematically seized art treasures and objects of scientific interest. Hermann sent Cuvier a letter containing his own interpretation of the specimen (though he had not examined it personally), which he believed to be a mammal, including the first known life restoration of a pterosaur. Hermann restored the animal with wing membranes extending from the long fourth finger to the ankle and a covering of fur (neither wing membranes nor fur had been preserved in the specimen). Hermann also added a membrane between the neck and wrist, as is the condition in bats. Cuvier agreed with this interpretation, and at Hermann&#x27;s suggestion, Cuvier became the first to publish these ideas in December 1800 in a very short description. However, contrary to Hermann, Cuvier was convinced the animal was a reptile. The specimen had not in fact been seized by the French. Rather, in 1802, following the death of Charles Theodore, it was brought to Munich, where Baron Johann Paul Carl von Moll had obtained a general exemption of confiscation for the Bavarian collections. Cuvier asked von Moll to study the fossil but was informed it could not be found. In 1809 Cuvier published a somewhat longer description, in which he named the animal &quot;Petro-Dactyle&quot;, this was a typographical error however, and was later corrected by him to &quot;Ptéro-Dactyle&quot;. He also refuted a hypothesis by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach that it would have been a shore bird. Cuvier remarked: &quot;It is not possible to doubt that the long finger served to support a membrane that, by lengthening the anterior extremity of this animal, formed a good wing.&quot;

Contrary to von Moll&#x27;s report, the fossil was not missing; it was being studied by Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring, who gave a public lecture about it on December 27, 1810. In January 1811, von Sömmerring wrote a letter to Cuvier deploring the fact that he had only recently been informed of Cuvier&#x27;s request for information. His lecture was published in 1812, and in it von Sömmerring named the species Ornithocephalus antiquus. The animal was described as being both a bat, and a form in between mammals and birds, i.e. not intermediate in descent but in &quot;affinity&quot; or archetype. Cuvier disagreed, and the same year in his &quot;Ossemens fossiles&quot; provided a lengthy description in which he restated that the animal was a reptile. It was not until 1817 that a second specimen of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; came to light, again from Solnhofen. This tiny specimen was that year described by von Sömmerring as &quot;Ornithocephalus brevirostris&quot;, named for its short snout, now understood to be a juvenile character (this specimen is now thought to represent a juvenile specimen of a different genus, probably &quot;Ctenochasma&quot;). He provided a restoration of the skeleton, the first one published for any pterosaur. This restoration was very inaccurate, von Sömmerring mistaking the long metacarpals for the bones of the lower arm, the lower arm for the humerus, this upper arm for the breast bone and this sternum again for the shoulder blades. Sömmerring did not change his opinion that these forms were bats and this &quot;bat model&quot; for interpreting pterosaurs would remain influential long after a consensus had been reached around 1860 that they were reptiles. The standard assumptions were that pterosaurs were quadrupedal, clumsy on the ground, furred, warmblooded and had a wing membrane reaching the ankle. Some of these elements have been confirmed, some refuted by modern research, while others remain disputed.

In 1815, the generic name &quot;Ptéro-Dactyle&quot; was latinized to &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque. Unaware of Rafinesque&#x27;s publication however, Cuvier himself in 1819 latinized the name &quot;Ptéro-Dactyle&quot; again to &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, but the specific name he then gave, &quot;longirostris&quot;, has to give precedence to von Sömmerring&#x27;s &quot;antiquus&quot;. In 1888, English naturalist Richard Lydekker designated &quot;Pterodactylus antiquus&quot; as the type species of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, and considered &quot;Ornithocephalus antiquus&quot; a synonym. He also designated specimen BSP AS.I.739 as the holotype of the genus.

==Description==

&quot;Pterodactylus&quot; is known from over 30 fossil specimens, and though most belong to juveniles, many preserve complete skeletons. &quot;Pterodactylus antiquus&quot; was a relatively small pterosaur, with an estimated adult wingspan of about , based on the only known adult specimen, which is represented by an isolated skull. Other &quot;species&quot; were once thought to have been smaller. However, these smaller specimens have been shown to represent juveniles of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, as well as its contemporary relatives including &quot;Ctenochasma&quot;, &quot;Germanodactylus&quot;, &quot;Aurorazhdarcho&quot;, &quot;Gnathosaurus&quot;, and hypothetically &quot;Aerodactylus&quot; if this genus is truly valid.

The skulls of adult &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; were long and thin, with about 90 narrow and conical teeth. The teeth extended back from the tips of both jaws, and became smaller farther away from the jaw tips. This was unlike the ones seen in most relatives, where teeth were absent in the upper jaw tip and were relatively uniform in size. The teeth of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; also extended farther back into the jaw compared to close relatives, and some were present below the front of the &quot;nasoantorbital fenestra&quot;, which is the largest opening in the skull. Another autapomorphy that &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; has is that the skull and jaws were straight, which are unlike the upwardly curved jaws seen in the related ctenochasmatids.
&quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, like related pterosaurs, had a crest on its skull composed mainly of soft tissues. In adult &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, this crest extended between the back edge of the antorbital fenestra and the back of the skull. In at least one specimen, the crest had a short bony base, also seen in related pterosaurs like &quot;Germanodactylus&quot;. Solid crests have only been found on large, fully adult specimens of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, indicating that this was a display structure that became larger and more well developed as individuals reached maturity. In 2013, pterosaur researcher S. Christopher Bennett noted that other authors claimed that the soft tissue crest of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; extended backward behind the skull; Bennett himself, however, didn&#x27;t find any evidence for the crest extending past the back of the skull. Two specimens of &quot;P. antiquus&quot; (the holotype specimen BSP AS I 739 and the incomplete skull BMMS 7, the largest known skull of &quot;P. antiquus&quot;) have a low bony crest on their skulls; in BMMS 7 it is 47.5 mm long (1.87 inches, more or less 24% of the estimated total length of its skull) and has a maximum height of 0.9 mm (0.035 inches) above the orbit. Several specimens previously referred to &quot;P. antiquus&quot; preserved evidence of the soft tissue extensions of these crests, including an &quot;occipital lappet&quot;, a flexible, tab-like structure extending from the back of the skull. Most of these specimens have been reclassified in the related species &quot;Aerodactylus scolopaciceps&quot;, which may however be nothing more than a junior synonym. Even if &quot;Aerodactylus&quot; were valid, at least one specimen with these features is still considered to belong to &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, BSP 1929 I 18, which has an occipital lappet similar to the proposed &quot;Aerodactylus&quot; definition, and also possesses a small triangular soft tissue crest with the peak of the crest positioned above the eyes.

==Paleobiology==
===Life history===

Like other pterosaurs (most notably &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot;), &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; specimens can vary considerably based on age or level of maturity. Both the proportions of the limb bones, size and shape of the skull, and size and number of teeth changed as the animals grew. Historically, this has led to various growth stages (including growth stages of related pterosaurs) being mistaken for new species of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;. Several detailed studies using various methods to measure growth curves among known specimens have suggested that there is actually only one valid species of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, &quot;P. antiquus&quot;.

The youngest immature specimens of &quot;Pterodactylus antiquus&quot; (alternately interpreted as young specimens of the distinct species &quot;P. kochi&quot;) have a small number of teeth, as few as 15 in some, and the teeth have a relatively broad base. The teeth of other &quot;P. antiquus&quot; specimens are both narrower and more numerous (up to 90 teeth are present in several specimens).

&quot;Pterodactylus&quot; specimens can be divided into two distinct year classes. In the first year class, the skulls are only in length. The second year class is characterized by skulls of around long, but are still immature however. These first two size groups were once classified as juveniles and adults of the species &quot;P. kochi&quot;, until further study showed that even the supposed &quot;adults&quot; were immature, and possibly belong to a distinct genus. A third year class is represented by specimens of the &quot;traditional&quot; &quot;P. antiquus&quot;, as well as a few isolated, large specimens once assigned to &quot;P. kochi&quot; that overlap &quot;P. antiquus&quot; in size. However, all specimens in this third year class also show sign of immaturity. Fully mature &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; specimens remain unknown, or may have been mistakenly classified as a different genus.

===Growth and breeding seasons===

The distinct year classes of &quot;Pterodactylus antiquus&quot; specimens show that this species, like the contemporary &quot;Rhamphorhynchus muensteri&quot;, likely bred seasonally and grew consistently during its lifetime. A new generation of 1st year class &quot;P. antiquus&quot; would have been produced seasonally, and reached 2nd-year size by the time the next generation hatched, creating distinct &#x27;clumps&#x27; of similarly-sized and aged individuals in the fossil record. The smallest size class probably consisted of individuals that had just begun to fly and were less than one year old. The second year class represents individuals one to two years old, and the rare third year class is composed of specimens over two years old. This growth pattern is similar to modern crocodilians, rather than the rapid growth of modern birds.

===Daily activity patterns===
Comparisons between the scleral rings of &quot;Pterodactylus antiquus&quot; and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been diurnal. This may also indicate niche partitioning with contemporary pterosaurs inferred to be nocturnal, such as &quot;Ctenochasma&quot; and &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot;.

===Diet===
Based on the shape, size, and arrangement of its teeth, &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; has long been recognized as a carnivore specializing in small animals. A 2020 study of pterosaur tooth wear supported the hypothesis that &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; preyed mainly on invertebrates and had a generalist feeding strategy, indicated by a relatively high bite force.

==Paleoecology==

Specimens of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; have been found mainly in the Solnhofen limestone (geologically known as the Altmühltal Formation) of Bavaria, Germany. The main composition of this formation is fine-grained limestone that originated mainly from the nearby towns Solnhofen and Eichstätt, which is formed by mud silt deposits. The Solnhofen Limestone is a diverse Lagerstätte that contains a wide range of different creatures, including highly detailed fossilized imprints of soft bodied organisms such as jellyfishes. Abundant specimens of pterosaurs similar to &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; were also found within the formation, these include the rhamphorhynchids &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Scaphognathus&quot;, several gallodactylids such as &quot;Aerodactylus&quot;, &quot;Ardeadactylus&quot;, &quot;Aurorazhdarcho&quot; and &quot;Cycnorhamphus&quot;, the ctenochasmatids &quot;Ctenochasma&quot; and &quot;Gnathosaurus&quot;, the anurognathid &quot;Anurognathus&quot;, the germanodactylid &quot;Germanodactylus&quot;, as well as the basal euctenochasmatian &quot;Diopecephalus&quot;. Fossil remains of the dinosaurs &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; and &quot;Compsognathus&quot; were also found within the limestone, these specimens were related to early evolution of feathers, since they were some of the only ones that had them during the Jurassic period. Various lizard remains were also found alongside those of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, with several specimens assigned to &quot;Ardeosaurus&quot;, &quot;Bavarisaurus&quot; and &quot;Eichstaettisaurus&quot;. Crocodylomorph specimens were widely distributed within the fossil site, most were assigned to the metriorhynchid genera &quot;Cricosaurus&quot;, &quot;Dakosaurus&quot;, &quot;Geosaurus&quot; and &quot;Rhacheosaurus&quot;. These genera are colloquially called as marine or sea crocodiles due to their similar built. The turtle genera &quot;Eurysternum&quot; and &quot;Paleomedusa&quot; were also found within the formation. Fossils of the ichthyosaur &quot;Aegirosaurus&quot; also appeared to be present in the site, as well as fish remains, with many specimens assigned to ray-finned fishes such as the halecomorphs &quot;Lepidotes&quot;, &quot;Propterus&quot;, &quot;Gyrodus&quot;, &quot;Mesturus&quot;, &quot;Proscinetes&quot;, &quot;Caturus&quot;, &quot;Ophiopsis&quot; and &quot;Ophiopsiella&quot;, the pachycormids &quot;Asthenocormus&quot;, &quot;Hypsocormus&quot; and &quot;Orthocormus&quot;, as well as the aspidorhynchid &quot;Aspidorhynchus&quot;, and the ichthyodectid &quot;Thrissops&quot;.

==Classification==

Initial classifications for &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; started when paleontologist Hermann von Meyer used the name Pterodactyli to contain &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; and other pterosaurs known at the time. This was emended to the family Pterodactylidae by Prince Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1838. However, this group has more recently been given several competing definitions.

Beginning in 2014, researchers Steven Vidovic and David Martill constructed an analysis in which several pterosaurs traditionally thought of as archaeopterodactyloids closely related to the ctenochasmatoids may have been more closely related to the more advanced dsungaripteroids, or in some cases, fall outside both groups. Their conclusion was published in 2017, in which they placed &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; as a basal member of the suborder Pterodactyloidea.
As illustrated below, the results of a different topology are based on a phylogenetic analysis made by Longrich, Martill, and Andres in 2018. Unlike the previous results above, they placed &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; within the clade Euctenochasmatia, resulting in a more derived position.
===Formerly assigned species===

Numerous species have been assigned to &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; in the years since its discovery. In the first half of the 19th century any new pterosaur species would be named &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, which thus became a &quot;wastebasket taxon&quot;. Even after clearly different forms had later been given their own generic name, new species would be created from the very productive sites, throughout Europe and North America, often based on only slightly different material.

The earliest reassignments of pterosaur species to &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; started in 1825, with the description of &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot;; fossil collector Georg Graf zu Münster alerted the German paleontologist Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring about several distinct fossil specimens, Sömmerring thought that they belonged to an ancient bird. Further fossil preparations had uncovered teeth, to which Graf zu Münster created a skull cast. He later sent the cast to Professor Georg August Goldfuss, who recognized it as a pterosaur, specifically a species of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;. At the time however, most paleontologists incorrectly consider the genus &quot;Ornithocephalus&quot; () to be the valid name for &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, and therefore the specimen found was named as &quot;Ornithocephalus Münsteri&quot;, which was first mentioned by Graf zu Münster himself. Another specimen was found and described by Graf zu Münster in 1839, he assigned this specimen to a new separate species called &quot;Ornithocephalus longicaudus&quot;; the specific name means &#x27;long tail&#x27;, in reference to the animal&#x27;s tail size. German paleontologist Hermann von Meyer in 1845 officially emended that the genus &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; had priority over &quot;Ornithocephalus&quot;, so he reassigned the species &quot;O. münsteri&quot; and &quot;O. longicaudus&quot; into &quot;Pterodactylus münsteri&quot; and &quot;Pterodactylus longicaudus&quot;. In 1846, von Meyer created the new species &quot;Pterodactylus gemmingi&quot; based on long-tailed remains; the specific name honors the fossil collector Carl Eming von Gemming. Later, in 1847, von Meyer finally erected the generic name &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot; () due to the distinctively long tails seen in the specimens found, which are much longer than those seen in &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;. He assigned the species &quot;P. longicaudus&quot; as the type species of &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot;, which resulted in a new combination called &quot;Rhamphorhynchus longicaudus&quot;. The species &quot;R. münsteri&quot; was later changed to &quot;R. muensteri&quot; by Lydekker in 1888, due to the ICZN rule that prohibits non-standard Latin characters, such as &quot;ü&quot;, in scientific names.
Beginning in 1846, many pterosaur specimens were found near the village of Burham in Kent, England by British paleontologists James Scott Bowerbank and Sir Richard Owen. Bowerbank had assigned fossil remains to two new species; the first was named in 1846 as &quot;Pterodactylus giganteus&quot;; the specific name means &#x27;the gigantic one&#x27; in Latin, in reference to the large size of the remains, and the second species was named in 1851 as &quot;Pterodactylus cuvieri&quot;, in honor of the French scientist Georges Cuvier. Later in 1851, Owen named and described new pterosaur specimens that have been found yet again in England. He assigned these specimens to a new species called &quot;Pterodactylus compressirostris&quot;. In 1914 however, paleontologist Reginald Hooley redescribed &quot;P. compressirostris&quot;, to which he erected the genus &quot;Lonchodectes&quot; (), and therefore made &quot;P. compressirostris&quot; the type species, and created the new combination &quot;L. compressirostris&quot;. In a 2013 review, &quot;P. giganteus&quot; and &quot;P. cuvieri&quot; were reassigned to new genera; &quot;P. giganteus&quot; was reassigned to a genus called &quot;Lonchodraco&quot; (&#x27;lance dragon&#x27;), which resulted in a new combination called &quot;L. giganteus&quot;, and &quot;P. cuvieri&quot; was reassigned to the new genus &quot;Cimoliopterus&quot; (&#x27;chalk wing&#x27;), creating &quot;C. cuvieri&quot;. Back in 1859, Owen had found remains the front part of a snout in the Cambridge Greensand, and assigned it into the species &quot;Pterodactylus segwickii&quot;; in honor of Adam Sedgwick, a British geologist. This species however, was reassigned to the genus &quot;Camposipterus&quot; in 2013, therefore creating the new combination &quot;Camposipterus segwickii&quot;. Later, in 1861, Owen had uncovered multiple distinctively looking fossil remains yet again in the Cambridge Greensand, these were assigned to a new species named &quot;Pterodactylus simus&quot;, though the British paleontologist Harry Govier Seeley had created a separate generic name called &quot;Ornithocheirus&quot;, and reassigned &quot;P. simus&quot; as the type species, which created the combination &quot;Ornithocheirus simus&quot;. Between the years 1869 and 1870, Seeley had reassigned many pterosaur species into &quot;Ornithocheirus&quot;, while also creating several new species. Many of these species however, are now reclassified to other genera, or considered . In 1874, further specimens were found in England, again by Owen, these ones were assigned to a new species called &quot;Pterodactylus sagittirostris&quot;, this species however, was reassigned to the genus &quot;Lonchodectes&quot; in 1914 by Hooley, which resulted in an &quot;L. sagittirostris&quot;. This conclusion was revised by Rigal &quot;et al.&quot; in 2017, who disagreed with Hooley&#x27;s reassignment, and therefore created the genus &quot;Serradraco&quot;, which afterwards resulted in a new combination called &quot;S. sagittirostris&quot;.
Assigning new pterosaur species to &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; was not only common in Europe, but also in North America; paleontologists such as Othniel Charles Marsh in 1871 for example, described several toothless pterosaur specimens, which were accompanied by teeth that belonged to the fish &quot;Xiphactinus&quot;, which Marsh assumed that these teeth belonged to the pterosaur specimens he found, since all pterosaurs discovered at the time had teeth. He then assigned these specimens to a new species called &quot;Pterodactylus oweni&quot;, but this was changed to &quot;Pterodactylus occidentalis&quot; because &quot;P. oweni&quot; was found to have been preoccupied by a pterosaur species described with the same name back in 1864 by Seeley. In 1872, American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope also found various pterosaur specimens in North America, he assigned these to two new species known as &quot;Ornithochirus umbrosus&quot; and &quot;Ornithochirus harpyia&quot;, Cope attempted to assign the specimens he found to the genus &quot;Ornithocheirus&quot;, but misspelled forgetting the &#x27;e&#x27;. In 1875 however, Cope reassigned the species &quot;O. umbrosus&quot; and &quot;O. harpyia&quot; into &quot;Pterodactylus umbrosus&quot; and &quot;Pterodactylus harpyia&quot;, though these species had been considered ever since. Paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston unearthed the first skull of the pterosaur, and found that the animal was toothless, this made Marsh create the genus &quot;Pteranodon&quot; (lit. &#x27;toothless wing&#x27;), and therefore reassigned all the American pterosaur species, including the ones that he named, from &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; to &quot;Pteranodon&quot;.

Later, in the 1980s, subsequent revisions by Peter Wellnhofer had reduced the number of recognized species to about half a dozen. Many species assigned to &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; had been based on juvenile specimens, and subsequently been recognized as immature individuals of other species or genera. By the 1990s it was understood that this was even true for part of the remaining species. &quot;P. elegans&quot;, for example, was found by numerous studies to be an immature &quot;Ctenochasma&quot;. Another species of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; originally based on small, immature specimens was &quot;P. micronyx&quot;. However, it has been difficult to determine exactly of what genus and species &quot;P. micronyx&quot; might be the juvenile form. Stéphane Jouve, Christopher Bennett and others had once suggested that it probably belonged either to &quot;Gnathosaurus subulatus&quot; or one of the species belonging to &quot;Ctenochasma&quot;, though after additional research Bennett assigned it to the genus &quot;Aurorazhdarcho&quot;. Another species with a complex history is &quot;P. longicollum&quot;, named by von Meyer in 1854, based on a large specimen with a long neck and fewer teeth. Many researchers, including David Unwin, have found &quot;P. longicollum&quot; to be distinct from &quot;P. kochi&quot; and &quot;P. antiquus&quot;. Unwin found &quot;P. longicollum&quot; to be closer to &quot;Germanodactylus&quot; and therefore requiring a new genus name. It has sometimes been placed in the genus &quot;Diopecephalus&quot; because Harry Govier Seeley based this genus partly on the &quot;P. longicollum&quot; material. However, it was shown by Bennett that the type specimen later designated for &quot;Diopecephalus&quot; was a fossil belonging to &quot;P. kochi&quot;, and no longer thought to be separate from &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;. &quot;Diopecephalus&quot; is therefore a synonym of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, and as such is unavailable for use as a new genus for &quot;&quot;P.&quot; longicollum&quot;. &quot;&quot;P.&quot; longicollum&quot; was eventually made the type species of a separate genus &quot;Ardeadactylus&quot;.

===Controversial species===

The only well-known and well-supported species left by the first decades of the 21st century were &quot;P. antiquus&quot; and &quot;P. kochi&quot;. However, most studies between 1995 and 2010 found little reason to separate even these two species, and treated them as synonymous. More recent studies of pterosaur relationships have found anurognathids and pterodactyloids to be sister groups, which would limit the more inclusive group Caelidracones to just two clades. In 1996, Bennett suggested that the differences between specimens of &quot;P. kochi&quot; and &quot;P. antiquus&quot; could be explained by differences in age, with &quot;P. kochi&quot; (including specimens alternately classified in the species &quot;P. scolopaciceps&quot;) representing an immature growth stage of &quot;P. antiquus&quot;. In a 2004 paper, Jouve used a different method of analysis and recovered the same result, showing that the &quot;distinctive&quot; features of &quot;P. kochi&quot; were age-related, and using mathematical comparison to show that the two forms are different growth stages of the same species. An additional review of the specimens published in 2013 demonstrated that some of the supposed differences between &quot;P. kochi&quot; and &quot;P. antiquus&quot; were due to measurement errors, further supporting their synonymy.

By the 2010s, a large body of research had been developed based on the idea that &quot;P. kochi&quot; and &quot;P. scolopaciceps&quot; were early growth stages of &quot;P. antiquus&quot;. However, in 2014, two scientists began publishing research that challenged this paradigm. Steven Vidovic and David Martill concluded that differences between specimens of &quot;P. kochi&quot;, &quot;P. scolopaciceps&quot;, and &quot;P. antiquus&quot;, such as different lengths of neck vertebrae, thinner or thicker teeth, more rounded skulls, and how far the teeth extended back in the jaws, were significant enough to separate them into three distinct species. Vidovic and Martill also performed a phylogenetic analysis which treated all relevant specimens as distinct units, and found that the &quot;P. kochi&quot; type specimen did not form a natural group with that of &quot;P. antiquus&quot;. They concluded that the genus &quot;Diopecephalus&quot; could be returned to use to distinguish &quot;&quot;P&quot;. kochi&quot; from &quot;P. antiquus&quot;. They named the new genus &quot;Aerodactylus&quot; for &quot;P. scolopaciceps&quot; as well. So, what Bennett considered early growth stages of one species, Vidovic and Martill considered representatives of new species.

In 2017, Bennett challenged this hypothesis, he claimed that while Vidovic and Martill had identified real differences between these three groups of specimens, they had not provided any rationale that the differences were enough to distinguish them as species, rather than just individual variation, growth changes, or simply due to crushing and distortion during the fossilization process. Bennett pointed in particular to the data used to distinguish &quot;Aerodactylus&quot;, which was so different from the data for related species, it might be due to an unnatural assemblage of specimens. As a result, Bennett continued to consider &quot;Diopecephalus&quot; and &quot;Aerodactylus&quot; simply as year-classes of immature &quot;Pterodactylus antiquus&quot;.

===List of species===
During its over-200-year history, the various species of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; have gone through a number of changes in classification and thus have acquired a large number of synonyms. Additionally, a number of species assigned to &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; are based on poor remains that have proven difficult to assign to one species or another and are therefore considered (). The following list includes names that were used to identify new pterosaur species that now have been reclassified, or until recently thought to be pertaining to &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; proper, and names based on other material that has as yet not been assigned to other genera. This list also includes species that are (&#x27;naked names&#x27;), which are species that were not published formally. Species that are (&#x27;forgotten names&#x27;) are the ones that have been disused, and species that are (&#x27;rejected names&#x27;) are the ones that have been rejected because a more preferable name had been accepted instead.


==Cultural significance==

&quot;Pterodactylus&quot; is regarded as one of the most iconic prehistoric creatures, with multiple appearances in books, movies, as well as television series and several videogames. The informal name &quot;pterodactyl&quot; is sometimes used to refer to any kind of animal belonging to the order Pterosauria, though most of the time to &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; itself and the distantly-related &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, the most well-known members of the group. The popular aspect of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; consists of an elongated head crest, and potentially large wings. Studies of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, however, conclude that it may even lack a bony cranial crest, though several analysis have proven that &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; may in fact have a crest made up of soft tissue instead of bone.

Another appearance of &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;-like creatures is in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth legendarium. In this novel, the Nazgûl, introduced as the Black Riders, are nine characters who rode flying monsters that looked similarly built to &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;. Christopher Tolkien, the son of the author, described the flying monsters as &quot;Nazgûl-birds&quot;; his father described the appearance of the steeds as somewhat &quot;pterodactylic&quot;, and acknowledged that these were obviously &quot;new mythology&quot;.

<text>Pterosaurs are an extinct clade of flying reptiles in the order Pterosauria. They existed during most of the Mesozoic: from the Late Triassic to the end of the Cretaceous (228 million to 66 million years ago). Pterosaurs are the earliest vertebrates known to have evolved powered flight. Their wings were formed by a membrane of skin, muscle, and other tissues stretching from the ankles to a dramatically lengthened fourth finger.

There were two major types of pterosaurs. Basal pterosaurs (also called &#x27;non-pterodactyloid pterosaurs&#x27; or &#x27;rhamphorhynchoids&#x27;) were smaller animals with fully toothed jaws and, typically, long tails. Their wide wing membranes probably included and connected the hind legs. On the ground, they would have had an awkward sprawling posture, but the anatomy of their joints and strong claws would have made them effective climbers, and some may have even lived in trees. Basal pterosaurs were insectivores or predators of small vertebrates. Later pterosaurs (pterodactyloids) evolved many sizes, shapes, and lifestyles. Pterodactyloids had narrower wings with free hind limbs, highly reduced tails, and long necks with large heads. On the ground, they walked well on all four limbs with an upright posture, standing plantigrade on the hind feet and folding the wing finger upward to walk on the three-fingered &quot;hand&quot;. They could take off from the ground, and fossil trackways show that at least some species were able to run, wade, and/or swim. Their jaws had horny beaks, and some groups lacked teeth. Some groups developed elaborate head crests with sexual dimorphism.

Pterosaurs sported coats of hair-like filaments known as pycnofibers, which covered their bodies and parts of their wings. Pycnofibers grew in several forms, from simple filaments to branching down feathers. These may be homologous to the down feathers found on both avian and some non-avian dinosaurs, suggesting that early feathers evolved in the common ancestor of pterosaurs and dinosaurs, possibly as insulation. They were warm-blooded (endothermic), active animals. The respiratory system had efficient unidirectional &quot;flow-through&quot; breathing using air sacs, which hollowed out their bones to an extreme extent. Pterosaurs spanned a wide range of adult sizes, from the very small anurognathids to the largest known flying creatures, including &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; and &quot;Hatzegopteryx&quot;, which reached wingspans of at least nine metres. The combination of endothermy, a good oxygen supply and strong muscles made pterosaurs powerful and capable flyers.

Pterosaurs are often referred to by popular media or the general public as &quot;flying dinosaurs&quot;, but dinosaurs are defined as the descendants of the last common ancestor of the Saurischia and Ornithischia, which excludes the pterosaurs. Pterosaurs are nonetheless more closely related to birds and other dinosaurs than to crocodiles or any other living reptile, though they are not bird ancestors. Pterosaurs are also colloquially referred to as pterodactyls, particularly in fiction and journalism. However, technically, &quot;pterodactyl&quot; may refer to members of the genus &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, and more broadly to members of the suborder Pterodactyloidea of the pterosaurs.
Pterosaurs had a variety of lifestyles. Traditionally seen as fish-eaters, the group is now understood to have also included hunters of land animals, insectivores, fruit eaters and even predators of other pterosaurs. They reproduced by eggs, some fossils of which have been discovered.

==Description==

The anatomy of pterosaurs was highly modified from their reptilian ancestors by the adaptation to flight. Pterosaur bones were hollow and air-filled, like those of birds. This provided a higher muscle attachment surface for a given skeletal weight. The bone walls were often paper-thin. They had a large and keeled breastbone for flight muscles and an enlarged brain able to coordinate complex flying behaviour. Pterosaur skeletons often show considerable fusion. In the skull, the sutures between elements disappeared. In some later pterosaurs, the backbone over the shoulders fused into a structure known as a notarium, which served to stiffen the torso during flight, and provide a stable support for the shoulder blade. Likewise, the sacral vertebrae could form a single synsacrum while the pelvic bones fused also.

Basal pterosaurs include the clades Dimorphodontidae (&quot;Dimorphodon&quot;), Campylognathididae (&quot;Eudimorphodon&quot;, &quot;Campyognathoides&quot;), and Rhamphorhynchidae (&quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot;, &quot;Scaphognathus&quot;).

Pterodactyloids include the clades Ornithocheiroidea (&quot;Istiodactylus&quot;, &quot;Ornithocheirus&quot;, &quot;Pteranodon&quot;), Ctenochasmatoidea (&quot;Ctenochasma&quot;, &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;), Dsungaripteroidea (&quot;Germanodactylus&quot;, &quot;Dsungaripterus&quot;), and Azhdarchoidea (&quot;Tapejara&quot;, &quot;Tupuxuara&quot;, &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot;).

The two groups overlapped in time, but the earliest pterosaurs in the fossil record are basal pterosaurs, and the latest pterosaurs are pterodactyloids.

The position of the clade Anurognathidae (&quot;Anurognathus, Jeholopterus, Vesperopterylus&quot;) is debated. Anurognathids were highly specialized. Small flyers with shortened jaws and a wide gape, some had large eyes suggesting nocturnal or crepuscular habits, mouth bristles, and feet adapted for clinging. Parallel adaptations are seen in birds and bats that prey on insects in flight.

===Size===
Pterosaurs had a wide range of sizes, though they were generally large. The smallest species had a wingspan no less than . The most sizeable forms represent the largest known animals ever to fly, with wingspans of up to .

Standing, such giants could reach the height of a modern giraffe. Traditionally, it was assumed that pterosaurs were extremely light relative to their size. Later, it was understood that this would imply unrealistically low densities of their soft tissues. Some modern estimates therefore extrapolate a weight of up to for the largest species.

===Skull, teeth, and crests===

Compared to the other vertebrate flying groups, the birds and bats, pterosaur skulls were typically quite large. Most pterosaur skulls had elongated jaws. Their skull bones tend to be fused in adult individuals. Early pterosaurs often had heterodont teeth, varying in build, and some still had teeth in the palate. In later groups the teeth mostly became conical. Front teeth were often longer, forming a &quot;prey grab&quot; in transversely expanded jaw tips, but size and position were very variable among species. With the derived Pterodactyloidea, the skulls became even more elongated, sometimes surpassing the combined neck and torso in length. This was caused by a stretching and fusion of the front snout bone, the premaxilla, with the upper jawbone, the maxilla. Unlike most archosaurs, the nasal and antorbital openings of pterodactyloid pterosaurs merged into a single large opening, called the &quot;nasoantorbital fenestra&quot;. This feature likely evolved to lighten the skull for flight. In contrast, the bones behind the eye socket contracted and rotated, strongly inclining the rear skull and bringing the jaw joint forward. The braincase was relatively large for reptiles.

In some cases, fossilized keratinous beak tissue has been preserved, though in toothed forms, the beak is small and restricted to the jaw tips and does not involve the teeth. Some advanced beaked forms were toothless, such as the Pteranodontidae and Azhdarchidae, and had larger, more extensive, and more bird-like beaks. Some groups had specialised tooth forms. The Istiodactylidae had recurved teeth for eating meat. Ctenochasmatidae used combs of numerous needle-like teeth for filter feeding; &quot;Pterodaustro&quot; could have over a thousand bristle-like teeth. Dsungaripteridae covered their teeth with jawbone tissue for a crushing function. If teeth were present, they were placed in separate tooth sockets. Replacement teeth were generated behind, not below, the older teeth.

The public image of pterosaurs is defined by their elaborate head crests. This was influenced by the distinctive backward-pointing crest of the well-known &quot;Pteranodon&quot;. The main positions of such crests are the front of the snout, as an outgrowth of the premaxillae, or the rear of the skull as an extension of the parietal bones in which case it is called a &quot;supraoccipital crest&quot;. Front and rear crests can be present simultaneously and might be fused into a single larger structure, the most expansive of which is shown by the Tapejaridae. &quot;Nyctosaurus&quot; sported a bizarre antler-like crest. The crests were only a few millimetres thin transversely. The bony crest base would typically be extended by keratinous or other soft tissue.

Since the 1990s, new discoveries and a more thorough study of old specimens have shown that crests are far more widespread among pterosaurs than previously assumed. That they were extended by or composed completely of keratin, which does not fossilize easily, had misled earlier research. For &quot;Pterorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, the true extent of these crests has only been uncovered using ultraviolet photography. While fossil crests used to be restricted to the more advanced Pterodactyloidea, &quot;Pterorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Austriadactylus&quot; show that even some early pterosaurs possessed them.

Like the upper jaws, the paired lower jaws of pterosaurs were very elongated. In advanced forms, they tended to be shorter than the upper cranium because the jaw joint was in a more forward position. The front lower jaw bones, the dentaries or &quot;ossa dentalia&quot;, were at the tip tightly fused into a central symphysis. This made the lower jaws function as a single connected whole, the mandible. The symphysis was often very thin transversely and long, accounting for a considerable part of the jaw length, up to 60%. If a crest was present on the snout, the symphysis could feature a matching mandible crest, jutting out to below. Toothed species also bore teeth in their dentaries. The mandible opened and closed in a simple vertical or &quot;orthal&quot; up-and-down movement.

===Vertebral column===

The vertebral column of pterosaurs numbered between thirty-four and seventy vertebrae. The vertebrae in front of the tail were &quot;procoelous&quot;: the cotyle (front of the vertebral body) was concave and into it fitted a convex extension at the rear of the preceding vertebra, the condyle. Advanced pterosaurs are unique in possessing special processes projecting adjacent to their condyle and cotyle, the exapophyses, and the cotyle also may possess a small prong on its midline called a hypapophysis.

The necks of pterosaurs were relatively long and straight. In pterodactyloids, the neck is typically longer than the torso. This length is not caused by an increase of the number of vertebrae, which is invariably seven. Some researchers include two transitional &quot;cervicodorsals&quot; which brings the number to nine. Instead, the vertebrae themselves became more elongated, up to eight times longer than wide. Nevertheless, the cervicals were wider than high, implying a better vertical than horizontal neck mobility. Pterodactyloids have lost all neck ribs. Pterosaur necks were probably rather thick and well-muscled, especially vertically.

The torso was relatively short and egg-shaped. The vertebrae in the back of pterosaurs originally might have numbered eighteen. With advanced species a growing number of these tended to be incorporated into the sacrum. Such species also often show a fusion of the front dorsal vertebrae into a rigid whole which is called the notarium after a comparable structure in birds. This was an adaptation to withstand the forces caused by flapping the wings. The notarium included three to seven vertebrae, depending on the species involved but also on individual age. These vertebrae could be connected by tendons or a fusion of their neural spines into a &quot;supraneural plate&quot;. Their ribs also would be tightly fused into the notarium. In general, the ribs are double headed. The sacrum consisted of three to ten sacral vertebrae. They too, could be connected via a supraneural plate that, however, would not contact the notarium.

The tails of pterosaurs were always rather slender. This means that the caudofemoralis retractor muscle which in most basal Archosauria provides the main propulsive force for the hindlimb, was relatively unimportant. The tail vertebrae were amphicoelous, the vertebral bodies on both ends being concave. Early species had long tails, containing up to fifty caudal vertebrae, the middle ones stiffened by elongated articulation processes, the zygapophyses, and chevrons. Such tails acted as rudders, sometimes ending at the rear in a vertical diamond-shaped or oval vane. In pterodactyloids, the tails were much reduced and never stiffened, with some species counting as few as ten vertebrae.

===Shoulder girdle===

The shoulder girdle was a strong structure that transferred the forces of flapping flight to the thorax. It was probably covered by thick muscle layers. The upper bone, the shoulder blade, was a straight bar. It was connected to a lower bone, the coracoid that is relatively long in pterosaurs. In advanced species, their combined whole, the scapulocoracoid, was almost vertically oriented. The shoulder blade in that case fitted into a recess in the side of the notarium, while the coracoid likewise connected to the breastbone. This way, both sides together made for a rigid closed loop, able to withstand considerable forces. A peculiarity was that the breastbone connections of the coracoids often were asymmetrical, with one coracoid attached in front of the other. In advanced species the shoulder joint had moved from the shoulder blade to the coracoid. The joint was saddle-shaped and allowed considerable movement to the wing. It faced sideways and somewhat upwards.

The breastbone, formed by fused paired &quot;sterna&quot;, was wide. It had only a shallow keel. Via sternal ribs, it was at its sides attached to the dorsal ribs. At its rear, a row of belly ribs or gastralia was present, covering the entire belly. To the front, a long point, the &quot;cristospina&quot;, jutted obliquely upwards. The rear edge of the breastbone was the deepest point of the thorax. Clavicles or interclavicles were completely absent.

===Wings===

Pterosaur wings were formed by bones and membranes of skin and other tissues. The primary membranes attached to the extremely long fourth finger of each arm and extended along the sides of the body. Where they ended has been very controversial but since the 1990s a dozen specimens with preserved soft tissue have been found that seem to show they attached to the ankles. The exact curvature of the trailing edge, however, is still equivocal.

While historically thought of as simple leathery structures composed of skin, research has since shown that the wing membranes of pterosaurs were highly complex dynamic structures suited to an active style of flight. The outer wings (from the tip to the elbow) were strengthened by closely spaced fibers called &quot;actinofibrils&quot;. The actinofibrils themselves consisted of three distinct layers in the wing, forming a crisscross pattern when superimposed on one another. The function of the actinofibrils is unknown, as is the exact material from which they were made. Depending on their exact composition (keratin, muscle, elastic structures, etc.), they may have been stiffening or strengthening agents in the outer part of the wing. The wing membranes also contained a thin layer of muscle, fibrous tissue, and a unique, complex circulatory system of looping blood vessels. The combination of actinofibrils and muscle layers may have allowed the animal to adjust the wing slackness and camber.

As shown by cavities in the wing bones of larger species and soft tissue preserved in at least one specimen, some pterosaurs extended their system of respiratory air sacs into the wing membrane.

====Parts of the wing====

The pterosaur wing membrane is divided into three basic units. The first, called the &quot;propatagium&quot; (&quot;fore membrane&quot;), was the forward-most part of the wing and attached between the wrist and shoulder, creating the &quot;leading edge&quot; during flight. The &quot;brachiopatagium&quot; (&quot;arm membrane&quot;) was the primary component of the wing, stretching from the highly elongated fourth finger of the hand to the hindlimbs. Finally, at least some pterosaur groups had a membrane that stretched between the legs, possibly connecting to or incorporating the tail, called the uropatagium; the extent of this membrane is not certain, as studies on &quot;Sordes&quot; seem to suggest that it simply connected the legs but did not involve the tail (rendering it a cruropatagium). A common interpretation is that non-pterodactyloid pterosaurs had a broader uro/cruropatagium stretched between their long fifth toes, with pterodactyloids, lacking such toes, only having membranes running along the legs.

There has been considerable argument among paleontologists about whether the main wing membranes (brachiopatagia) attached to the hindlimbs, and if so, where. Fossils of the rhamphorhynchoid &quot;Sordes&quot;, the anurognathid &quot;Jeholopterus&quot;, and a pterodactyloid from the Santana Formation seem to demonstrate that the wing membrane did attach to the hindlimbs, at least in some species. However, modern bats and flying squirrels show considerable variation in the extent of their wing membranes and it is possible that, like these groups, different species of pterosaur had different wing designs. Indeed, analysis of pterosaur limb proportions shows that there was considerable variation, possibly reflecting a variety of wing-plans.

The bony elements of the arm formed a mechanism to support and extend the wing. Near the body, the humerus or upper arm bone is short but powerfully built. It sports a large deltopectoral crest, to which the major flight muscles are attached. Despite the considerable forces exerted on it, the humerus is hollow or pneumatised inside, reinforced by bone struts. The long bones of the lower arm, the ulna and radius, are much longer than the humerus. They were probably incapable of pronation.

A bone unique to pterosaurs, known as the pteroid, connected to the wrist and helped to support the forward membrane (the propatagium) between the wrist and shoulder. Evidence of webbing between the three free fingers of the pterosaur forelimb suggests that this forward membrane may have been more extensive than the simple pteroid-to-shoulder connection traditionally depicted in life restorations. The position of the pteroid bone itself has been controversial. Some scientists, notably Matthew Wilkinson, have argued that the pteroid pointed forward, extending the forward membrane and allowing it to function as an adjustable flap. This view was contradicted in a 2007 paper by Chris Bennett, who showed that the pteroid did not articulate as previously thought and could not have pointed forward, but rather was directed inward toward the body as traditionally interpreted. Specimens of &quot;Changchengopterus pani&quot; and &quot;Darwinopterus linglongtaensis&quot; show the pteroid in articulation with the proximal syncarpal, suggesting that the pteroid articulated with the &#x27;saddle&#x27; of the radiale (proximal syncarpal) and that both the pteroid and preaxial carpal were migrated centralia.

The pterosaur wrist consists of two inner (proximal, at the side of the long bones of the arm) and four outer (distal, at the side of the hand) carpals (wrist bones), excluding the pteroid bone, which may itself be a modified distal carpal. The proximal carpals are fused together into a &quot;syncarpal&quot; in mature specimens, while three of the distal carpals fuse to form a distal syncarpal. The remaining distal carpal, referred to here as the medial carpal, but which has also been termed the distal lateral, or pre-axial carpal, articulates on a vertically elongate biconvex facet on the anterior surface of the distal syncarpal. The medial carpal bears a deep concave fovea that opens anteriorly, ventrally and somewhat medially, within which the pteroid articulates, according to Wilkinson.

In derived pterodactyloids like pteranodontians and azhdarchoids, metacarpals I-III are small and do not connect to the carpus, instead hanging in contact with the fourth metacarpal. With these derived species, the fourth metacarpal has been enormously elongated, typically equalling or exceeding the length of the long bones of the lower arm. The fifth metacarpal had been lost. In all species, the first to third fingers are much smaller than the fourth, the &quot;wingfinger&quot;, and contain two, three and four phalanges respectively. The smaller fingers are clawed, with the ungual size varying among species. In nyctosaurids the forelimb digits besides the wingfinger have been lost altogether. The wingfinger accounts for about half or more of the total wing length. It normally consists of four phalanges. Their relative lengths tend to vary among species, which has often been used to distinguish related forms. The fourth phalanx is usually the shortest. It lacks a claw and has been lost completely by nyctosaurids. It is curved to behind, resulting in a rounded wing tip, which reduces induced drag. The wingfinger is also bent somewhat downwards.

When standing, pterosaurs probably rested on their metacarpals, with the outer wing folded to behind. In this position, the &quot;anterior&quot; sides of the metacarpals were rotated to the rear. This would point the smaller fingers obliquely to behind. According to Bennett, this would imply that the wingfinger, able to describe the largest arc of any wing element, up to 175°, was not folded by flexion but by an extreme extension. The wing was automatically folded when the elbow was bowed.

A laser-simulated fluorescence scan on &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; also identified a membranous &quot;fairing&quot; (area conjunctioning the wing with the body at the neck), as opposed to the feathered or fur-composed &quot;fairing&quot; seen in birds and bats respectively.

===Pelvis===

The pelvis of pterosaurs was of moderate size compared to the body as a whole. Often the three pelvic bones were fused. The ilium was long and low, its front and rear blades projecting horizontally beyond the edges of the lower pelvic bones. Despite this length, the rod-like form of these processes indicates that the hindlimb muscles attached to them were limited in strength. The, in side view narrow, pubic bone fused with the broad ischium into an ischiopubic blade. Sometimes, the blades of both sides were also fused, closing the pelvis from below and forming the pelvic canal. The hip joint was not perforated and allowed considerable mobility to the leg. It was directed obliquely upwards, preventing a perfectly vertical position of the leg.

The front of the pubic bones articulated with a unique structure, the paired prepubic bones. Together these formed a cusp covering the rear belly, between the pelvis and the belly ribs. The vertical mobility of this element suggests a function in breathing, compensating the relative rigidity of the chest cavity.

===Hindlimbs===

The hindlimbs of pterosaurs were strongly built, yet relative to their wingspans smaller than those of birds. They were long in comparison to the torso length. The thighbone was rather straight, with the head making only a small angle with the shaft. This implies that the legs were not held vertically below the body but were somewhat sprawling. The shinbone was often fused with the upper ankle bones into a tibiotarsus that was longer than the thighbone. It could attain a vertical position when walking. The calf bone tended to be slender, especially at its lower end that in advanced forms did not reach the ankle, sometimes reducing total length to a third. Typically, it was fused to the shinbone. The ankle was a simple, &quot;mesotarsal&quot;, hinge. The, rather long and slender, metatarsus was always splayed to some degree. The foot was plantigrade, meaning that during the walking cycle the sole of the metatarsus was pressed onto the soil.

There was a clear difference between early pterosaurs and advanced species regarding the form of the fifth digit. Originally, the fifth metatarsal was robust and not very shortened. It was connected to the ankle in a higher position than the other metatarsals. It bore a long, and often curved, mobile clawless fifth toe consisting of two phalanges. The function of this element has been enigmatic. It used to be thought that the animals slept upside-down like bats, hanging from branches and using the fifth toes as hooks. Another hypothesis held that they stretched the brachiopatagia, but in articulated fossils the fifth digits are always flexed towards the tail. Later it became popular to assume that these toes extended an uropatagium or cruropatagium between them. As the fifth toes were on the outside of the feet, such a configuration would only have been possible if these rotated their fronts outwards in flight. Such a rotation could be caused by an abduction of the thighbone, meaning that the legs would be spread. This would also turn the feet into a vertical position. They then could act as rudders to control yaw. Some specimens show membranes between the toes, allowing them to function as flight control surfaces. The uropatagium or cruropatagium would control pitch. When walking the toes could flex upwards to lift the membrane from the ground. In Pterodactyloidea, the fifth metatarsal was much reduced and the fifth toe, if present, little more than a stub. This suggests that their membranes were split, increasing flight maneuverability.

The first to fourth toes were long. They had two, three, four and five phalanges respectively. Often the third toe was longest; sometimes the fourth. Flat joints indicate a limited mobility. These toes were clawed but the claws were smaller than the hand claws.

===Soft tissues===
The rare conditions that allowed for the fossilisation of pterosaur remains, sometimes also preserved soft tissues. Modern synchrotron or ultraviolet light photography has revealed many traces not visible to the naked eye. These are often imprecisely called &quot;impressions&quot; but mostly consist of petrifications, natural casts and transformations of the original material. They may include horn crests, beaks or claw sheaths as well as the various flight membranes. Exceptionally, muscles were preserved. Skin patches show small round non-overlapping scales on the soles of the feet, the ankles and the ends of the metatarsals. They covered pads cushioning the impact of walking. Scales are unknown from other parts of the body.

====Pycnofibers====

Most or all pterosaurs had hair-like filaments known as pycnofibers on the head and torso. The term &quot;pycnofiber&quot;, meaning &quot;dense filament&quot;, was coined by palaeontologist Alexander Kellner and colleagues in 2009. Pycnofibers were unique structures similar to, but not homologous (sharing a common origin) with, mammalian hair, an example of convergent evolution. A fuzzy integument was first reported from a specimen of &quot;Scaphognathus crassirostris&quot; in 1831 by Georg August Goldfuss, but had been widely doubted. Since the 1990s, pterosaur finds and histological and ultraviolet examination of pterosaur specimens have provided incontrovertible proof: pterosaurs had pycnofiber coats. &quot;Sordes pilosus&quot; (which translates as &quot;hairy demon&quot;) and &quot;Jeholopterus ninchengensis&quot; show pycnofibers on the head and body.

The presence of pycnofibers strongly indicates that pterosaurs were endothermic (warm-blooded). They aided thermoregulation, as is common in warm-blooded animals who need insulation to prevent excessive heat-loss. Pycnofibers were flexible, short filaments, about five to seven millimetres long and rather simple in structure with a hollow central canal. Pterosaur pelts might have been comparable in density to many Mesozoic mammals.

Pterosaur filaments could share a common origin with feathers, as speculated in 2002 by Czerkas and Ji. In 2009, Kellner concluded that pycnofibers were structured similarly to theropod proto-feathers. Others were unconvinced, considering the difference with the &quot;quills&quot; found on many of the bird-like maniraptoran specimens too fundamental.

A 2018 study of the remains of two small Jurassic-age pterosaurs from Inner Mongolia, China, found that pterosaurs had a wide array of pycnofiber shapes and structures, as opposed to the homogeneous structures that had generally been assumed to cover them. Some of these had frayed ends, very similar in structure to four different feather types known from birds or other dinosaurs but almost never known from pterosaurs prior to the study, suggesting homology. A response to this study was published in 2020, where it was suggested that the structures seen on the anurognathids were actually a result of the decomposition of aktinofibrils: a type of fibre used to strengthen and stiffen the wing. However, in a response to this, the authors of the 2018 paper point to the fact that the presence of the structures extend past the patagium, and the presence of both aktinofibrils and filaments on &quot;Jeholopterus ningchengensis&quot; and &quot;Sordes pilosus&quot;. The various forms of filament structure present on the anurognathids in the 2018 study would also require a form of decomposition that would cause the different &#x27;filament&#x27; forms seen. They therefore conclude that the most parsimonious interpretation of the structures is that they are filamentous protofeathers. But Liliana D&#x27;Alba points out that the description of the preserved integumentary structures on the two anurognathid specimens is still based upon gross morphology. She also points out that &quot;Pterorhynchus&quot; was described to have feathers to support the claim that feathers had a common origin with Ornithodirans but was argued against by several authors. The only method to assure if it was homologous to feathers is to use a scanning electron microscope.

In 2022, a new fossil of &quot;Tupandactylus cf. imperator&quot; was found to have melanosomes in forms that signal an earlier-than-anticipated development of patterns found in extant feathers. The new specimen suggested that pterosaur integumentary melanosomes exhibited a more complex organization than those previously known from other pterosaurs. This indicates the presence of a unique form of melanosomes within pterosaur integument at the time, distinct from previously known contemporary integumentary structures and more similar to those reported from mammalian hair and avian feathers. The feather fossils obtained from this specimen also suggest the presence of Stage IIIa feathers, a new discovery that indicates more complex feather structures were present in pterosaurs. The study describing this specimen further clarifies the timeline of avian feather evolution and suggests that the feather-specific melanosome signaling found in extant birds are possibly homologous with those found in pterosaurs.

==History of discovery==
===First finds===

Pterosaur fossils are very rare, due to their light bone construction. Complete skeletons can generally only be found in geological layers with exceptional preservation conditions, the so-called &quot;Lagerstätten&quot;. The pieces from one such &quot;Lagerstätte&quot;, the Late Jurassic Solnhofen Limestone in Bavaria, became much sought after by rich collectors. In 1784, Italian naturalist Cosimo Alessandro Collini was the first scientist to describe a pterosaur fossil. At that time the concepts of evolution and extinction were imperfectly developed. The bizarre build of the pterosaur was shocking, as it could not clearly be assigned to any existing animal group. The discovery of pterosaurs would thus play an important role in the progress of modern paleontology and geology. Scientific opinion at the time was that if such creatures were still alive, only the sea was a credible habitat; Collini suggested it might be a swimming animal that used its long front limbs as paddles. A few scientists continued to support the aquatic interpretation even until 1830, when German zoologist Johann Georg Wagler suggested that &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; used its wings as flippers and was affiliated with Ichthyosauria and Plesiosauria.

In 1800, Johann Hermann first suggested that it represented a flying creature in a letter to Georges Cuvier. Cuvier agreed in 1801, understanding it was an extinct flying reptile. In 1809, he coined the name &quot;Ptéro-Dactyle&quot;, &quot;wing-finger&quot;. This was in 1815 Latinised to &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;. At first most species were assigned to this genus and ultimately &quot;pterodactyl&quot; was popularly and incorrectly applied to all members of Pterosauria. Today, paleontologists limit the term to the genus &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; or members of the Pterodactyloidea.

In 1812 and 1817, Samuel Thomas von Soemmerring redescribed the original specimen and an additional one. He saw them as affiliated to birds and bats. Although he was mistaken in this, his &quot;bat model&quot; would be influential during the 19th century. In 1843, Edward Newman thought pterosaurs were flying marsupials. Ironically, as the &quot;bat model&quot; depicted pterosaurs as warm-blooded and furred, it would turn out to be more correct in certain aspects than Cuvier&#x27;s &quot;reptile model&quot; in the long run. In 1834, Johann Jakob Kaup coined the term Pterosauria.

===Expanding research===

In 1828, Mary Anning found in England the first pterosaur genus outside Germany, named as &quot;Dimorphodon&quot; by Richard Owen, also the first non-pterodactyloid pterosaur known. Later in the century, the Early Cretaceous Cambridge Greensand produced thousands of pterosaur fossils, that however, were of poor quality, consisting mostly of strongly eroded fragments. Nevertheless, based on these, numerous genera and species would be named. Many were described by Harry Govier Seeley, at the time the main English expert on the subject, who also wrote the first pterosaur book, &quot;Ornithosauria&quot;, and in 1901 the first popular book, &quot;Dragons of the Air&quot;. Seeley thought that pterosaurs were warm-blooded and dynamic creatures, closely related to birds. Earlier, the evolutionist St. George Jackson Mivart had suggested pterosaurs were the direct ancestors of birds. Owen opposed the views of both men, seeing pterosaurs as cold-blooded &quot;true&quot; reptiles.

In the US, Othniel Charles Marsh in 1870 discovered &quot;Pteranodon&quot; in the Niobrara Chalk, then the largest known pterosaur, the first toothless one and the first from America. These layers too rendered thousands of fossils, also including relatively complete skeletons that were three-dimensionally preserved instead of being strongly compressed as with the Solnhofen specimens. This led to a much better understanding of many anatomical details, such as the hollow nature of the bones.

Meanwhile, finds from the Solnhofen had continued, accounting for the majority of complete high-quality specimens discovered. They allowed to identify most new basal taxa, such as &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot;, &quot;Scaphognathus&quot; and &quot;Dorygnathus&quot;. This material gave birth to a German school of pterosaur research, which saw flying reptiles as the warm-blooded, furry and active Mesozoic counterparts of modern bats and birds. In 1882, Marsh and Karl Alfred Zittel published studies about the wing membranes of specimens of &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot;. German studies continued well into the 1930s, describing new species such as &quot;Anurognathus&quot;. In 1927, Ferdinand Broili discovered hair follicles in pterosaur skin, and paleoneurologist Tilly Edinger determined that the brains of pterosaurs more resembled those of birds than modern cold-blooded reptiles.

In contrast, English and American paleontologists by the middle of the twentieth century largely lost interest in pterosaurs. They saw them as failed evolutionary experiments, cold-blooded and scaly, that hardly could fly, the larger species only able to glide, being forced to climb trees or throw themselves from cliffs to achieve a take-off. In 1914, for the first-time pterosaur aerodynamics were quantitatively analysed, by Ernest Hanbury Hankin and David Meredith Seares Watson, but they interpreted &quot;Pteranodon&quot; as a pure glider. Little research was done on the group during the 1940s and 1950s.

===Pterosaur renaissance===

The situation for dinosaurs was comparable. From the 1960s onwards, a dinosaur renaissance took place, a quick increase in the number of studies and critical ideas, influenced by the discovery of additional fossils of &quot;Deinonychus&quot;, whose spectacular traits refuted what had become entrenched orthodoxy. In 1970, likewise the description of the furry pterosaur &quot;Sordes&quot; began what Robert Bakker named a renaissance of pterosaurs. Kevin Padian especially propagated the new views, publishing a series of studies depicting pterosaurs as warm-blooded, active and running animals. This coincided with a revival of the German school through the work of Peter Wellnhofer, who in 1970s laid the foundations of modern pterosaur science. In 1978, he published the first pterosaur textbook, the &quot;Handbuch der Paläoherptologie, Teil 19: Pterosauria&quot;, and in 1991 the second ever popular science pterosaur book, the &quot;Encyclopedia of Pterosaurs&quot;.

This development accelerated through the exploitation of two new &quot;Lagerstätten&quot;. During the 1970s, the Early Cretaceous Santana Formation in Brazil began to produce chalk nodules that, though often limited in size and the completeness of the fossils they contained, perfectly preserved three-dimensional pterosaur skeletal parts. German and Dutch institutes bought such nodules from fossil poachers and prepared them in Europe, allowing their scientists to describe many new species and revealing a whole new fauna. Soon, Brazilian researchers, among them Alexander Kellner, intercepted the trade and named even more species.

Even more productive was the Early Cretaceous Chinese Jehol Biota of Liaoning that since the 1990s has brought forth hundreds of exquisitely preserved two-dimensional fossils, often showing soft tissue remains. Chinese researchers such as Lü Junchang have again named many new taxa. As discoveries also increased in other parts of the world, a sudden surge in the total of named genera took place. By 2009, when they had increased to about ninety, this growth showed no sign of levelling-off. In 2013, M.P. Witton indicated that the number of discovered pterosaur species had risen to 130. Over ninety percent of known taxa has been named during the &quot;renaissance&quot;. Many of these were from groups the existence of which had been unknown. Advances in computing power enabled researchers to determine their complex relationships through the quantitative method of cladistics. New and old fossils yielded much more information when subjected to modern ultraviolet light or roentgen photography, or CAT-scans. Insights from other fields of biology were applied to the data obtained. All this resulted in a substantial progress in pterosaur research, rendering older accounts in popular science books completely outdated.

In 2017 a fossil from a 170-million-year-old pterosaur, later named as the species &quot;Dearc sgiathanach&quot; in 2022, was discovered on the Isle of Skye in Scotland. The National Museum of Scotland claims that it is the largest of its kind ever discovered from the Jurassic period, and it has been described as the world&#x27;s best-preserved skeleton of a pterosaur.

==Evolution and extinction==

===Origins===

Because pterosaur anatomy has been so heavily modified for flight, and immediate transitional fossil predecessors have not so far been described, the ancestry of pterosaurs is not fully understood. The oldest known pterosaurs were already fully adapted to a flying lifestyle. Since Seeley, it was recognised that pterosaurs were likely to have had their origin in the &quot;archosaurs&quot;, what today would be called the Archosauromorpha. In the 1980s, early cladistic analyses found that they were Avemetatarsalians (archosaurs closer to dinosaurs than to crocodilians). As this would make them also rather close relatives of the dinosaurs, these results were seen by Kevin Padian as confirming his interpretation of pterosaurs as bipedal warm-blooded animals. Because these early analyses were based on a limited number of taxa and characters, their results were inherently uncertain.

Several influential researchers who rejected Padian&#x27;s conclusions offered alternative hypotheses. David Unwin proposed an ancestry among the basal Archosauromorpha, specifically long-necked forms (&quot;protorosaurs&quot;) such as tanystropheids. A placement among basal archosauriforms like &quot;Euparkeria&quot; was also suggested. Basal archosauromorps such as these seemed to be good candidates for close pterosaur relatives due to their long-limbed anatomy; especially notable is &quot;Sharovipteryx&quot;, which posessed skin membranes on its hindlimbs likely used for gliding. A 1999 study by Michael Benton reinfroced that pterosaurs were avemetatarsalians closely related to &quot;Scleromochlus,&quot; and named the group Ornithodira to encompass pterosaurs and dinosaurs&quot;.&quot; In 1996, research S. Christopher Bennett published an analysis finding pterosaurs to be protorosaurs or closely related to them after removing characteristics of the hindlimb from his analysis, to test the possibility of locomotion-based convergent evolution between pterosaurs and dinosaurs. A 2007 reply by Dave Hone and Michael Benton could not reproduce this result, finding pterosaurs to be closely related to dinosaurs even without hindlimb characters. They concluded that, although more basal pterosauromorphs are needed to clarify their relationships, current evidence indicates that pterosaurs are avemetatarsalians, as either the sister group of &quot;Scleromochlus&quot; or a branch between the latter and &quot;Lagosuchus&quot;. 

A 2011 archosaur-focused phylogenetic analysis by Sterling Nesbitt benefited from far more data and found strong support for pterosaurs being avemetatarsalians, though &quot;Scleromochlus&quot; was not included due to its poor preservation. A 2016 archosauromorph-focused study by Martin Ezcurra included various proposed pterosaur relatives, yet also found pterosaurs to be closer to dinosaurs and unrelated to more basal taxa. Working from his 1996 analysis, Bennett published a 2020 study on &quot;Scleromochlus&quot; which argued that both &quot;Scleromochlus&quot; and pterosaurs were non-archosaur archosauromorphs, albeit not particularly closely related to each other. By contrast, a later 2020 study proposed that lagerpetid archosaurs were the sister clade to pterosauria. This was based on newly described fossil skulls and forelimbs showing various anatomical similarities with pterosaurs and reconstructions of lagerpetid brains and sensory systems based on CT scans also showing neuroanatomical similarities with pterosaurs. The results of the latter study were subsequently supported by an independent analysis of early pterosauromorph interrelationships.

A related problem is the origin of pterosaur flight. Like with birds, hypotheses can be ordered into two main varieties: &quot;ground up&quot; or &quot;tree down&quot;. Climbing a tree would cause height and gravity to provide both the energy and a strong selection pressure for incipient flight. Rupert Wild in 1983 proposed a hypothetical &quot;propterosaurus&quot;: a lizard-like arboreal animal developing a membrane between its limbs, first to safely parachute and then, gradually elongating the fourth finger, to glide. However, subsequent cladistic results did not fit this model well. Neither protorosaurs nor ornithodirans are biologically equivalent to lizards. Furthermore, the transition between gliding and flapping flight is not well-understood. More recent studies on basal pterosaur hindlimb morphology seem to vindicate a connection to &quot;Scleromochlus&quot;. Like this archosaur, basal pterosaur lineages have plantigrade hindlimbs that show adaptations for saltation.

At least one study found that the early Triassic ichnofossil &quot;Prorotodactylus&quot; is anatomically similar to that of early pterosaurs.

===Extinction===

It was once thought that competition with early bird species might have resulted in the extinction of many of the pterosaurs. It was thought that by the end of the Cretaceous, only large species of pterosaurs were present (no longer true; see below). The smaller species were thought to have become extinct, their niche filled by birds. However, pterosaur decline (if actually present) seems unrelated to bird diversity, as ecological overlap between the two groups appears to be minimal. In fact, at least some avian niches were reclaimed by pterosaurs prior to the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. It seems that the K-Pg extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous, which wiped out all non-avian dinosaurs and many other animals, was the direct cause of the extinction of the pterosaurs.

Small-sized pterosaur species apparently were present in the Csehbánya Formation, indicating a higher diversity of Late Cretaceous pterosaurs than previously accounted for. The recent findings of a small cat-sized adult azhdarchid further indicate that small pterosaurs from the Late Cretaceous might actually have simply been rarely preserved in the fossil record, helped by the fact that there is a strong bias against terrestrial small sized vertebrates such as juvenile dinosaurs, and that their diversity might actually have been much larger than previously thought.

A 2021 study showcases that niches previously occupied by small pterosaurs were increasingly occupied by the juvenile stages of larger species in the Late Cretaceous. Rather than being outcompeted by birds, pterosaurs essentially specialized a trend already occurring in previous eras of the Mesozoic.

==Classification and phylogeny==
In phylogenetic taxonomy, the clade Pterosauria has usually been defined as node-based and anchored to several extensively studied taxa as well as those thought to be primitive. One 2003 study defined Pterosauria as &quot;The most recent common ancestor of the Anurognathidae, &quot;Preondactylus&quot; and &quot;Quetzalcoatlus&quot; and all their descendants.&quot; However, these types of definition would inevitably leave any related species that are slightly more primitive out of the Pterosauria. To remedy this, a new definition was proposed that would anchor the name not to any particular species but to an anatomical feature, the presence of an enlarged fourth finger that supports a wing membrane. This &quot;apomorophy-based&quot; definition was adopted by the PhyloCode in 2020 as &quot;[T]he clade characterized by the apomorphy fourth manual digit hypertrophied to support a wing membrane, as inherited by &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; (originally &quot;Ornithocephalus&quot;) &quot;antiquus&quot; (Sömmerring 1812)&quot;. A broader clade, Pterosauromorpha, has been defined as all ornithodirans more closely related to pterosaurs than to dinosaurs.

The internal classification of pterosaurs has historically been difficult, because there were many gaps in the fossil record. Starting from the 21st century, new discoveries are now filling in these gaps and giving a better picture of the evolution of pterosaurs. Traditionally, they were organized into two suborders: the Rhamphorhynchoidea, a &quot;primitive&quot; group of long-tailed pterosaurs, and the Pterodactyloidea, &quot;advanced&quot; pterosaurs with short tails. However, this traditional division has been largely abandoned. Rhamphorhynchoidea is a paraphyletic (unnatural) group, since the pterodactyloids evolved directly from them and not from a common ancestor, so, with the increasing use of cladistics, it has fallen out of favor among most scientists.

The precise relationships between pterosaurs is still unsettled. Many studies of pterosaur relationships in the past have included limited data and were highly contradictory. However, newer studies using larger data sets are beginning to make things clearer. The cladogram (family tree) below follows a phylogenetic analysis presented by Longrich, Martill and Andres in 2018, with clade names after Andres &quot;et al.&quot; (2014).


==Paleobiology==
===Flight===

The mechanics of pterosaur flight are not completely understood or modeled at this time.

Katsufumi Sato, a Japanese scientist, did calculations using modern birds and concluded that it was impossible for a pterosaur to stay aloft. In the book &quot;Posture, Locomotion, and Paleoecology of Pterosaurs&quot; it is theorized that they were able to fly due to the oxygen-rich, dense atmosphere of the Late Cretaceous period. However, both Sato and the authors of &quot;Posture, Locomotion, and Paleoecology of Pterosaurs&quot; based their research on the now-outdated theories of pterosaurs being seabird-like, and the size limit does not apply to terrestrial pterosaurs, such as azhdarchids and tapejarids. Furthermore, Darren Naish concluded that atmospheric differences between the present and the Mesozoic were not needed for the giant size of pterosaurs.

Another issue that has been difficult to understand is how they took off. Earlier suggestions were that pterosaurs were largely cold-blooded gliding animals, deriving warmth from the environment like modern lizards, rather than burning calories. In this case, it was unclear how the larger ones of enormous size, with an inefficient cold-blooded metabolism, could manage a bird-like takeoff strategy, using only the hind limbs to generate thrust for getting airborne. Later research shows them instead as being warm-blooded and having powerful flight muscles, and using the flight muscles for walking as quadrupeds. Mark Witton of the University of Portsmouth and Mike Habib of Johns Hopkins University suggested that pterosaurs used a vaulting mechanism to obtain flight. The tremendous power of their winged forelimbs would enable them to take off with ease. Once aloft, pterosaurs could reach speeds of up to and travel thousands of kilometres.

In 1985, the Smithsonian Institution commissioned aeronautical engineer Paul MacCready to build a half-scale working model of &quot;Quetzalcoatlus northropi&quot;. The replica was launched with a ground-based winch. It flew several times in 1986 and was filmed as part of the Smithsonian&#x27;s IMAX film &quot;On the Wing&quot;.

Large-headed species are thought to have forwardly swept their wings in order to better balance.

===Air sacs and respiration===
A 2009 study showed that pterosaurs had a lung-and-air-sac system and a precisely controlled skeletal breathing pump, which supports a flow-through pulmonary ventilation model in pterosaurs, analogous to that of birds. The presence of a air sac system in at least some pterodactyloids would have further reduced the density of the living animal. Like modern crocodilians, pterosaurs appeared to have had a hepatic piston, seeing as their shoulder-pectoral girdles were too inflexible to move the sternum as in birds, and they possessed strong gastralia. Thus, their respiratory system had characteristics comparable to both modern archosaur clades.

===Nervous system===

An X-ray study of pterosaur brain cavities revealed that the animals (&quot;Rhamphorhynchus muensteri&quot; and &quot;Anhanguera santanae&quot;) had massive flocculi. The flocculus is a brain region that integrates signals from joints, muscles, skin and balance organs. The pterosaurs&#x27; flocculi occupied 7.5% of the animals&#x27; total brain mass, more than in any other vertebrate. Birds have unusually large flocculi compared with other animals, but these only occupy between 1 and 2% of total brain mass.

The flocculus sends out neural signals that produce small, automatic movements in the eye muscles. These keep the image on an animal&#x27;s retina steady. Pterosaurs may have had such a large flocculus because of their large wing size, which would mean that there was a great deal more sensory information to process. The low relative mass of the flocculi in birds is also a result of birds having a much larger brain overall; though this has been considered an indication that pterosaurs lived in a structurally simpler environment or had less complex behaviour compared to birds, recent studies of crocodilians and other reptiles show that it is common for sauropsids to achieve high intelligence levels with small brains. Studies on the endocast of &quot;Allkaruen&quot; show that brain evolution in pterodactyloids was a modular process.

===Terrestrial locomotion===

Pterosaurs&#x27; hip sockets are oriented facing slightly upwards, and the head of the femur (thigh bone) is only moderately inward facing, suggesting that pterosaurs had an erect stance. It would have been possible to lift the thigh into a horizontal position during flight, as gliding lizards do.

There was considerable debate whether pterosaurs ambulated as quadrupeds or as bipeds. In the 1980s, paleontologist Kevin Padian suggested that smaller pterosaurs with longer hindlimbs, such as &quot;Dimorphodon&quot;, might have walked or even run bipedally, in addition to flying, like road runners. However, a large number of pterosaur trackways were later found with a distinctive four-toed hind foot and three-toed front foot; these are the unmistakable prints of pterosaurs walking on all fours.

Fossil footprints show that pterosaurs stood with the entire foot in contact with the ground (plantigrade), in a manner similar to many mammals like humans and bears. Footprints from azhdarchids and several unidentified species show that pterosaurs walked with an erect posture with their four limbs held almost vertically beneath the body, an energy-efficient stance used by most modern birds and mammals, rather than the sprawled limbs of modern reptiles. Indeed, erect-limbs may be omnipresent in pterosaurs.

Though traditionally depicted as ungainly and awkward when on the ground, the anatomy of some pterosaurs (particularly pterodactyloids) suggests that they were competent walkers and runners. Early pterosaurs have long been considered particularly cumbersome locomotors due to the presence of large cruropatagia, but they too appear to have been generally efficient on the ground.

The forelimb bones of azhdarchids and ornithocheirids were unusually long compared to other pterosaurs, and, in azhdarchids, the bones of the arm and hand (metacarpals) were particularly elongated. Furthermore, as a whole, azhdarchid front limbs were proportioned similarly to fast-running ungulate mammals. Their hind limbs, on the other hand, were not built for speed, but they were long compared with most pterosaurs, and allowed for a long stride length. While azhdarchid pterosaurs probably could not run, they would have been relatively fast and energy efficient.

The relative size of the hands and feet in pterosaurs (by comparison with modern animals such as birds) may indicate the type of lifestyle pterosaurs led on the ground. Azhdarchid pterosaurs had relatively small feet compared to their body size and leg length, with foot length only about 25–30% the length of the lower leg. This suggests that azhdarchids were better adapted to walking on dry, relatively solid ground. &quot;Pteranodon&quot; had slightly larger feet (47% the length of the tibia), while filter-feeding pterosaurs like the ctenochasmatoids had very large feet (69% of tibial length in &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, 84% in &quot;Pterodaustro&quot;), adapted to walking in soft muddy soil, similar to modern wading birds. Though clearly forelimb-based launchers, basal pterosaurs have hindlimbs well adapted for hopping, suggesting a connection with archosaurs such as &quot;Scleromochlus&quot;.

===Swimming===
Tracks made by ctenochasmatoids indicate that these pterosaurs swam using their hindlimbs. In general, these have large hindfeet and long torsos, indicating that they were probably more adapted for swimming than other pterosaurs. Pteranodontians conversely have several speciations in their humeri interpreted to have been suggestive of a water-based version of the typical quadrupedal launch, and several like boreopterids must have foraged while swimming, as they seem incapable of frigatebird-like aerial hawking. These adaptations are also seen in terrestrial pterosaurs like azhdarchids, which presumably still needed to launch from water in case they found themselves in it. The nyctosaurid &quot;Alcione&quot; may display adaptations for wing-propelled diving like modern gannets and tropicbirds.

===Diet and feeding habits===

Traditionally, almost all pterosaurs were seen as surface-feeding piscivores or fish-eaters, a view that still dominates popular science. Today, many pterosaurs groups are thought to have been terrestrial carnivores, omnivores or insectivores.

Early-on it was recognised that the small Anurognathidae were nocturnal, aerial insectivores. With highly flexible joints on the wing finger, a broad, triangular wing shape, large eyes and short tail, these pterosaurs were likely analogous to nightjars or extant insectivorous bats, being capable of high manoeuvrability at relatively low speeds.

Interpretations of the habits of basal groups have changed profoundly. &quot;Dimorphodon&quot;, envisioned as a puffin analogue in the past, is indicated by its jaw structure, gait, and poor flight capabilities, as a terrestrial/semiarboreal predator of small mammals, squamates, and large insects. Its robust dentition caused &quot;Campylognathoides&quot; to be seen as a generalist or a terrestrial predator of small vertebrates, but the highly robust humerus and high-aspect wing morphology, suggest it may have been capable of grabbing prey on the wing; a later study indicates it was teuthophagous based on squid findings within its gut. The small insectivorous &quot;Carniadactylus&quot; and the larger &quot;Eudimorphodon&quot; were highly aerial animals and fast, agile flyers with long robust wings. &quot;Eudimorphodon&quot; has been found with fish remains in its stomach, but its dentition suggests an opportunistic diet. Slender-winged &quot;Austriadactylus&quot; and &quot;Caviramus&quot; were likely terrestrial/semiarboreal generalists. &quot;Caviramus&quot; likely had a strong bite force, indicating an adaptation towards hard food items that might have been chewed in view of the tooth wear.

Some Rhamphorhynchidae, such as &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot; itself or &quot;Dorygnathus&quot;, were fish-eaters with long, slender wings, needle-like dentition and long, thin jaws. &quot;Sericipterus&quot;, &quot;Scaphognathus&quot; and &quot;Harpactognathus&quot; had more robust jaws and teeth (which were ziphodont, dagger-shaped, in &quot; Sericipterus&quot;), and shorter, broader wings. These were either terrestrial/aerial predators of vertebrates or corvid-like generalists. Wukongopteridae like &quot;Darwinopterus&quot; were first considered aerial predators. Lacking a robust jaw structure or powerful flying muscles, they are now seen as arboreal or semiterrestrial insectivores. &quot;Darwinopterus robustidens&quot;, in particular, seems to have been a beetle specialist.

Among pterodactyloids, a greater variation in diet is present. Pteranodontia contained many piscivorous taxa, such as the Ornithocheirae, Boreopteridae, Pteranodontidae and Nyctosauridae. Niche partitioning caused ornithocheirans and the later nyctosaurids to be aerial dip-feeders like today&#x27;s frigatebirds (with the exception of the plunge-diving adapted &quot;Alcione elainus&quot;), while boreopterids were freshwater diving animals similar to cormorants, and pteranodonts pelagic plunge-divers akin to boobies and gannets. An analysis of &quot;Lonchodraco&quot; found clusters of foramina at the tip of its beak; birds with similarly numerous foramina have sensitive beaks used to feel for food, so &quot;Lonchodraco&quot; may have used its beak to feel for fish or invertebrates in shallow water. The istiodactylids were likely primarily scavengers. Archaeopterodactyloidea obtained food in coastal or freshwater habitats. &quot;Germanodactylus&quot; and &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; were piscivores, while the Ctenochasmatidae were suspension feeders, using their numerous fine teeth to filter small organisms from shallow water. &quot;Pterodaustro&quot; was adapted for flamingo-like filter-feeding.

In contrast, Azhdarchoidea mostly were terrestrial pterosaurs. Tapejaridae were arboreal omnivores, supplementing seeds and fruits with small insects and vertebrates. Dsungaripteridae were specialist molluscivores, using their powerful jaws to crush the shells of molluscs and crustaceans. Thalassodromidae were likely terrestrial carnivores. &quot;Thalassodromeus&quot; itself was named after a fishing method known as &quot;skim-feeding&quot;, later understood to be biomechanically impossible. Perhaps it pursued relatively large prey, in view of its reinforced jaw joints and relatively high bite force. Azhdarchidae are now understood to be terrestrial predators akin to ground hornbills or some storks, eating any prey item they could swallow whole. &quot;Hatzegopteryx&quot; was a robustly built predator of relatively large prey, including medium-sized dinosaurs. &quot;Alanqa&quot; may have been a specialist molluscivore.

A 2021 study reconstructed the adductor musculature of skulls from pterodactyloids, estimating the bite force and potential dietary habits of nine selected species. The study corroborated the view of pteranodontids, nyctosaurids and anhanuerids as piscivores based on them being relatively weak but fast biters, and suggest that &quot;Tropeognathus mesembrinus&quot; was specialised in consuming relatively large prey compared to &quot;Anhanguera&quot;. &quot;Dsungaripterus&quot; was corroborated as a durophage, with &quot;Thalassodromeus&quot; proposed to share this feeding habit based on high estimated bite force quotients (BFQ) and absolute bite force values. &quot;Tapejara wellnhoferi&quot; was corroborated as a specialised consumer of hard plant material with a relatively high BFQ and high mechanical advantage, and &quot;Caupedactylus ybaka&quot; and &quot;Tupuxuara leonardii&quot; were proposed to be ground-feeding generalists with intermediate bite force values and less specialised jaws.

===Natural predators===

Pterosaurs are known to have been eaten by theropods. In the 1 July 2004 edition of &quot;Nature&quot;, paleontologist Éric Buffetaut discusses an Early Cretaceous fossil of three cervical vertebrae of a pterosaur with the broken tooth of a spinosaur, most likely &quot;Irritator&quot;, embedded in it. The vertebrae are known not to have been eaten and exposed to digestion, as the joints are still articulated. Fossils of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; have been found with tooth marks from sharks such as &quot;Squalicorax&quot;, and a fossil with tooth marks from the &quot;Toolebuc formation&quot; has been interpreted as being attacked or scavenged by an ichthyosaur (most likely &quot;Platypterygius&quot;).

===Reproduction and life history===

While very little is known about pterosaur reproduction, it is believed that, similar to all dinosaurs, all pterosaurs reproduced by laying eggs, though such findings are very rare. The first known pterosaur eggs were found in the quarries of Liaoning, the same place that yielded feathered dinosaurs, and in Loma del Pterodaustro (Lagarcito Formation, Argentina). The eggs from Liaoning were squashed flat with no signs of cracking, so evidently the eggs had leathery shells, as in modern lizards. The egg from the Lagarcito Formation was laid by a &quot;Pterodaustro&quot;, a pterosaur known by abundant material. This was supported by the description of an additional pterosaur egg belonging to the genus &quot;Darwinopterus&quot;, described in 2011, which also had a leathery shell and, also like modern reptiles but unlike birds, was fairly small compared to the size of the mother. In 2014 five unflattened eggs from the species &quot;Hamipterus tianshanensis&quot; were found in an Early Cretaceous deposit in northwest China. Examination of the shells by scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of a thin calcareous eggshell layer with a membrane underneath. A study of pterosaur eggshell structure and chemistry published in 2007 indicated that it is likely pterosaurs buried their eggs, like modern crocodiles and turtles. Egg-burying would have been beneficial to the early evolution of pterosaurs, as it allows for more weight-reducing adaptations, but this method of reproduction would also have put limits on the variety of environments pterosaurs could live in and may have disadvantaged them when they began to face ecological competition from birds.

A &quot;Darwinopterus&quot; specimen showcases that at least some pterosaurs had a pair of functional ovaries, as opposed to the single functional ovary in birds, dismissing the reduction of functional ovaries as a requirement for powered flight.

Wing membranes preserved in pterosaur embryos are well developed, suggesting that pterosaurs were ready to fly soon after birth. However, tomography scans of fossilised &quot;Hamipterus&quot; eggs suggests that the young pterosaurs had well-developed thigh bones for walking, but weak chests for flight. It is unknown if this holds true for other pterosaurs. Fossils of pterosaurs only a few days to a week old (called &quot;flaplings&quot;) have been found, representing several pterosaur families, including pterodactylids, rhamphorhinchids, ctenochasmatids and azhdarchids. All preserve bones that show a relatively high degree of hardening (&quot;ossification&quot;) for their age, and wing proportions similar to adults. In fact, many pterosaur flaplings have been considered adults and placed in separate species in the past. Additionally, flaplings are normally found in the same sediments as adults and juveniles of the same species, such as the &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; and &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot; flaplings found in the Solnhofen limestone of Germany, and &quot;Pterodaustro&quot; flaplings from Argentina. All are found in deep aquatic environment far from shore.

For the majority of pterosaur species, it is not known whether they practiced any form of parental care, but their ability to fly as soon as they emerged from the egg and the numerous flaplings found in environments far from nests and alongside adults has led most researchers, including Christopher Bennett and David Unwin, to conclude that the young were dependent on their parents for a relatively short period of time, during a period of rapid growth while the wings grew long enough to fly, and then left the nest to fend for themselves, possibly within days of hatching. Alternatively, they may have used stored yolk products for nourishment during their first few days of life, as in modern reptiles, rather than depend on parents for food. Fossilised &quot;Hamipterus&quot; nests were shown preserving many male and female pterosaurs together with their eggs in a manner to a similar to that of modern seabird colonies. Due to how underdeveloped the chests of the hatchlings were for flying, it was suggested that &quot;Hamipterus&quot; may have practiced some form of parental care. However, this study has since been criticised. Most evidence currently leans towards pterosaur hatchlings being superprecocial, similar to that of megapode birds, which fly after hatching without the need of parental care. A further study compares evidence for superprecociality and &quot;late term flight&quot; and overwhelmingly suggests that most if not all pterosaurs were capable of flight soon after hatching. A later study suggested that while smaller-bodied pterosaurs were most likely superprecocial or precocial, owing to the consistent or decreasing wing aspect ratio during growth, certain large-bodied pterosaurs, such as &quot;Pteranodon&quot; showed possible evidence of their young being altricial, due to the fast rate the limb bones closest to the body grew compared to any other element of their skeleton after hatching. Other factors mentioned were the limits of soft shelled eggs and the size of the pelvic opening of large female pterosaurs.

Growth rates of pterosaurs once they hatched varied across different groups. In more primitive, long-tailed pterosaurs (&quot;rhamphorhynchoids&quot;), such as &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot;, the average growth rate during the first year of life was 130% to 173%, slightly faster than the growth rate of alligators. Growth in these species slowed after sexual maturity, and it would have taken more than three years for &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot; to attain maximum size. In contrast, the more advanced, large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, grew to adult size within the first year of life. Additionally, pterodactyloids had &quot;determinate growth&quot;, meaning that the animals reached a fixed maximum adult size and stopped growing.

A 2021 study indicates that pterosaur juveniles of larger species increasingly took the roles previously occupied by adult small pterosaurs.

===Daily activity patterns===
Comparisons between the scleral rings of pterosaurs and modern birds and reptiles have been used to infer daily activity patterns of pterosaurs. The pterosaur genera &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, &quot;Scaphognathus&quot;, and &quot;Tupuxuara&quot; have been inferred to be diurnal, &quot;Ctenochasma&quot;, &quot;Pterodaustro&quot;, and &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot; have been inferred to be nocturnal, and &quot;Tapejara&quot; has been inferred to be cathemeral, being active throughout the day for short intervals. As a result, the possibly fish-eating &quot;Ctenochasma&quot; and &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot; may have had similar activity patterns to modern nocturnal seabirds, and the filter-feeding &quot;Pterodaustro&quot; may have had similar activity patterns to modern anseriform birds that feed at night. The differences between activity patterns of the Solnhofen pterosaurs &quot;Ctenochasma&quot;, &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot;, &quot;Scaphognathus&quot;, and &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; may also indicate niche partitioning between these genera.

==Cultural significance==
Pterosaurs have been a staple of popular culture for as long as their cousins the dinosaurs, though they are usually not featured as prominently in films, literature or other art. While the depiction of dinosaurs in popular media has changed radically in response to advances in paleontology, a mainly outdated picture of pterosaurs has persisted since the mid-20th century.

The vague generic term &quot;pterodactyl&quot; is often used for these creatures. The animals depicted in fiction and pop culture frequently represent either the &quot;Pteranodon&quot; or (non-pterodactyloid) &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot;, or a fictionalized hybrid of the two. Many children&#x27;s toys and cartoons feature &quot;pterodactyls&quot; with &quot;Pteranodon&quot;-like crests and long, &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot;-like tails and teeth, a combination that never existed in nature. However, at least one pterosaur &quot;did&quot; have both the &quot;Pteranodon&quot;-like crest and teeth: &quot;Ludodactylus&quot;, whose name means &quot;toy finger&quot; for its resemblance to old, inaccurate children&#x27;s toys. Pterosaurs have sometimes been incorrectly identified as (the ancestors of) birds, though birds are theropod dinosaurs and not descendants of pterosaurs.

Pterosaurs were used in fiction in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s 1912 novel &quot;The Lost World&quot; and its 1925 film adaptation. They appeared in a number of films and television programs since, including the 1933 film &quot;King Kong&quot;, and 1966&#x27;s &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; In the latter, animator Ray Harryhausen had to add inaccurate bat-like wing fingers to his stop motion models in order to keep the membranes from falling apart, though this particular error was common in art even before the film was made. Rodan, a fictional giant monster (or &quot;kaiju&quot;) which first appeared in the 1956 film &quot;Rodan&quot;, is portrayed as an enormous irradiated species of &quot;Pteranodon&quot;. Rodan has appeared in multiple Japanese &quot;Godzilla&quot; films released during the 1960s, 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s, and also appeared in the 2019 American-produced film &quot;&quot;.

After the 1960s, pterosaurs remained mostly absent from notable American film appearances until 2001&#x27;s &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot;. Paleontologist Dave Hone noted that the pterosaurs in this film had not been significantly updated to reflect modern research. Errors persisting were teeth while toothless &quot;Pteranodon&quot; was intended to be depicted, nesting behavior that was known to be inaccurate by 2001, and leathery wings, rather than the taut membranes of muscle fiber required for pterosaur flight. Petrie from &quot;The Land Before Time&quot; (1988), is a notable example from an animated film.

In most media appearances, pterosaurs are depicted as piscivores, not reflecting their full dietary variation. They are also often shown as aerial predators similar to birds of prey, grasping human victims with talons on their feet. However, only the small anurognathid &quot;Vesperopterylus&quot; and small wukongopterid &quot;Kunpengopterus&quot; are known to possess prehensile feet and hands respectively; all other known pterosaurs have flat, plantigrade feet with no opposable toes, and the feet are generally proportionally small, at least in the case of the Pteranodontia.

<text>Pteranodon (; from and ) is a genus of pterosaur that included some of the largest known flying reptiles, with &quot;P. longiceps&quot; having a wingspan of over . They lived during the late Cretaceous geological period of North America in present-day Kansas, Nebraska, Wyoming, South Dakota and Alabama. More fossil specimens of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; have been found than any other pterosaur, with about 1,200 specimens known to science, many of them well preserved with nearly complete skulls and articulated skeletons. It was an important part of the animal community in the Western Interior Seaway.

When the first fossils of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; were found, they were assigned to toothed pterosaur genera, &quot;Ornithocheirus&quot; and &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;. In 1876, Othniel Charles Marsh recognised it as a genus of its own, making particular note of its complete lack of teeth, which at the time was unique among pterosaurs. Over the decades, multiple species would be assigned to &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, though today, only two are recognised: &quot;P. longiceps&quot;, the type species, and &quot;P. sternbergi&quot;. A third species, &quot;P. maiseyi&quot;, may also exist. Some have suggested that the latter two as genus of their own, &quot;Geosternbergia&quot;, though this is the subject of some debate. Another genus split from &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, &quot;Dawndraco&quot;, may be synonymous with &quot;Geosternbergia&quot; if that genus is valid, or with &quot;Pteranodon&quot; if it is not.

&quot;Pteranodon&quot; is part of the family Pteranodontidae, part of the clade Pteranodontia, which also includes nyctosaurids. Pteranodontians form a larger clade, Pteranodontoidea, alongside ornithocheiromorphs, and that clade falls under the suborder Pterodactyloidea. While not dinosaurs, pterosaurs such as &quot;Pteranodon&quot; form a clade closely related to dinosaurs as both fall within the clade Avemetatarsalia.

Male and female &quot;Pteranodon&quot; differed in size and crest shape. Males attained wingspans of ; females were smaller, averaging . The crests of males were far larger than those of females. In &quot;P. longiceps&quot;, they were long and backswept, whereas in &quot;P. sternbergi&quot;, they were tall and upright. Females also had wider pelvises than males.

==Discovery and history==
===First fossils===
&quot;Pteranodon&quot; was the first pterosaur found outside of Europe. Its fossils first were found by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1871, in the Late Cretaceous Smoky Hill Chalk deposits of western Kansas. These chalk beds were deposited at the bottom of what was once the Western Interior Seaway, a large shallow sea over what now is the midsection of the North American continent. These first specimens, YPM 1160 and YPM 1161, consisted of partial wing bones, as well as a tooth from the prehistoric fish &quot;Xiphactinus&quot;, which Marsh mistakenly believed to belong to this new pterosaur (all known pterosaurs up to that point had teeth). In 1871, Marsh named the find &quot;Pterodactylus oweni&quot;, assigning it to the well-known (but much smaller) European genus &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;. Marsh also collected more wing bones of the large pterosaur in 1871. Realizing that the name he had chosen had already been used for Harry Seeley&#x27;s European pterosaur species &quot;Pterodactylus oweni&quot; in 1864, Marsh renamed his giant North American pterosaur &quot;Pterodactylus occidentalis&quot;, meaning &quot;Western wing finger,&quot; in his 1872 description of the new specimen. He named two additional species, based on size differences: &quot;Pterodactylus ingens&quot; (the largest specimen so far), and &quot;Pterodactylus velox&quot; (the smallest).

Meanwhile, Marsh&#x27;s rival Edward Drinker Cope had unearthed several specimens of the large North American pterosaur. Based on these specimens, Cope named two new species, Ornithochirus umbrosus and &quot;Ornithochirus harpyia&quot;, in an attempt to assign them to the large European genus &quot;Ornithocheirus&quot;, though he misspelled the name (forgetting the &#x27;e&#x27;). Cope&#x27;s paper naming his species was published in 1872, just five days after Marsh&#x27;s paper. This resulted in a dispute, fought in the published literature, over whose names had priority in what obviously were the same species. Cope conceded in 1875 that Marsh&#x27;s names did have priority over his, but maintained that &quot;Pterodactylus umbrosus&quot; was a distinct species (but not genus) from any that Marsh had named previously. Re-evaluation by later scientists has supported Marsh&#x27;s case, refuting Cope&#x27;s assertion that &quot;P. umbrosus&quot; represented a larger, distinct species.

===A toothless pterosaur===
While the first &quot;Pteranodon&quot; wing bones were collected by Marsh and Cope in the early 1870s, the first &quot;Pteranodon&quot; skull was found on May 2, 1876, along the Smoky Hill River in Wallace County (now Logan County), Kansas, USA, by Samuel Wendell Williston, a fossil collector working for Marsh. A second, smaller skull soon was discovered as well. These skulls showed that the North American pterosaurs were different from any European species, in that they lacked teeth and had bony crests on their skulls. Marsh recognized this major difference, describing the specimens as &quot;distinguished from all previously known genera of the order Pterosauria by the entire absence of teeth.&quot; Marsh recognized that this characteristic warranted a new genus, and he coined the name &quot;Pteranodon&quot; (&quot;wing without tooth&quot;) in 1876. Marsh reclassified all the previously named North American species from &quot;Pterodactylus&quot; to &quot;Pteranodon&quot;. He considered the smaller skull to belong to &quot;Pteranodon occidentalis&quot;, based on its size. Marsh classified the larger skull, YPM 1117, in the new species &quot;Pteranodon longiceps&quot;, which he thought to be a medium-sized species in between the small &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; and the large &quot;P. ingens&quot;. Marsh also named several additional species: Pteranodon comptus and &quot;Pteranodon nanus&quot; were named for fragmentary skeletons of small individuals, while &quot;Pteranodon gracilis&quot; was based on a wing bone that he mistook for a pelvic bone. He soon realized his mistake, and re-classified that specimen again into a separate genus, which he named &quot;Nyctosaurus&quot;. &quot;P. nanus&quot; was also later recognized as a &quot;Nyctosaurus&quot; specimen.

In 1892, Samuel Williston examined the question of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; classification. He noticed that, in 1871, Seeley had mentioned the existence of a partial set of toothless pterosaur jaws from the Cambridge Greensand of England, which he named &quot;Ornithostoma&quot;. Because the primary characteristic Marsh had used to separate &quot;Pteranodon&quot; from other pterosaurs was its lack of teeth, Williston concluded that &quot;Ornithostoma&quot; must be considered the senior synonym of &quot;Pteranodon&quot;. However, in 1901, Pleininger pointed out that &quot;Ornithostoma&quot; had never been scientifically described or even assigned a species name until Williston&#x27;s work, and therefore had been a &quot;nomen nudum&quot; and could not beat out &quot;Pteranodon&quot; for naming priority. Williston accepted this conclusion and went back to calling the genus &quot;Pteranodon&quot;. However, both Williston and Pleininger were incorrect, because unnoticed by both of them was the fact that, in 1891, Seeley himself had finally described and properly named &quot;Ornithostoma&quot;, assigning it to the species &quot;O. sedgwicki&quot;. In the 2010s, more research on the identity of &quot;Ornithostoma&quot; showed that it was probably not &quot;Pteranodon&quot; or even a close relative, but may in fact have been an azhdarchoid, a different type of toothless pterosaur.

===Revising species===
Williston was also the first scientist to critically evaluate all of the &quot;Pteranodon&quot; species classified by Cope and Marsh. He agreed with most of Marsh&#x27;s classification, with a few exceptions. First, he did not believe that &quot;P. ingens&quot; and &quot;P. umbrosus&quot; could be considered synonyms, which even Cope had come to believe. He considered both &quot;P. velox&quot; and &quot;P. longiceps&quot; to be dubious; the first was based on non-diagnostic fragments, and the second, though known from a complete skull, probably belonged to one of the other, previously-named species. In 1903, Williston revisited the question of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; classification, and revised his earlier conclusion that there were seven species down to just three. He considered both &quot;P. comptus&quot; and &quot;P. nanus&quot; to be specimens of &quot;Nyctosaurus&quot;, and divided the others into small (&quot;P. velox&quot;), medium (&quot;P. occidentalis&quot;), and large species (&quot;P. ingens&quot;), based primarily on the shape of their upper arm bones. He thought &quot;P. longiceps&quot;, the only one known from a skull, could be a synonym of either &quot;P. velox&quot; or &quot;P. occidentalis&quot;, based on its size.

In 1910, Eaton became the first scientist to publish a more detailed description of the entire &quot;Pteranodon&quot; skeleton, as it was known at the time. He used his findings to revise the classification of the genus once again based on a better understanding of the differences in pteranodont anatomy. Eaton conducted experiments using clay models of bones to help determine the effects of crushing and flattening on the shapes of the arm bones Williston had used in his own classification. Eaton found that most of the differences in bone shapes could be easily explained by the pressures of fossilization, and concluded that no &quot;Pteranodon&quot; skeletons had any significant differences from each other besides their size. Therefore, Eaton was left to decide his classification scheme based on differences in the skulls alone, which he assigned to species just as Marsh did, by their size. In the end, Eaton recognized only three valid species: &quot;P. occidentalis&quot;, &quot;P. ingens&quot;, and &quot;P. longiceps&quot;.

The discovery of specimens with upright crests, classified by Harksen in 1966 as the new species &quot;Pteranodon sternbergi&quot;, complicated the situation even further. prompting another revision of the genus by Halsey W. Miller in 1972. Because it was impossible to determine crest shape for all of the species based on headless skeletons, Miller concluded that all &quot;Pteranodon&quot; species except the two based on skulls (&quot;P. longiceps&quot; and &quot;P. sternbergi&quot;) must be considered &quot;nomena dubia&quot; and abandoned. The skull Eaton thought belonged to &quot;P. ingens&quot; was placed in the new species &quot;Pteranodon marshi&quot;, and the skull Eaton assigned to &quot;P. occidentalis&quot; was re-named &quot;Pteranodon eatoni&quot;. Miller also recognized another species based on a skull with a crest similar to that of &quot;P. sternbergi&quot;; Miller named this &quot;Pteranodon walkeri&quot;. To help bring order to this tangle of names, Miller created three subgenera. &quot;P. marshi&quot; and &quot;P. longiceps&quot; were placed in the subgenus &quot;Longicepia&quot;, though this was later changed to simply &quot;Pteranodon&quot; due to the rules of priority. &quot;P. sternbergi&quot; and &quot;P. walkeri&quot;, the upright-crested species, were given the subgenus &quot;Sternbergia&quot;, which was later changed to &quot;Geosternbergia&quot; because &quot;Sternbergia&quot; was preoccupied. Finally, Miller named the subgenus &quot;Occidentalia&quot; for &quot;P. eatoni&quot;, the skull formerly associated with &quot;P. occidentalis&quot;. Miller further expanded the concept of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; to include &quot;Nyctosaurus&quot; as a fourth subgenus. Miller considered these to be an evolutionary progression, with the primitive &quot;Nyctosaurus&quot;, at the time thought to be crestless, giving rise to small-crested &quot;Occidentalia&quot;, which in turn gave rise to long-crested &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, finally leading to tall-crested &quot;Geosternbergia&quot;. However, Miller made several mistakes in his study concerning which specimens Marsh had assigned to which species, and most scientists disregarded his work on the subject in their later research. In 1984, Robert Milton Schoch published another revision that essentially returned to Marsh&#x27;s original classification scheme, most notably sinking &quot;P. longiceps&quot; as a synonym of &quot;P. ingens&quot;.

===Recognizing variation===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, S. Christopher Bennett published several major papers reviewing the anatomy, taxonomy and life history of &quot;Pteranodon&quot;. In 1992, he published a paper discussing sexual dimorphism and its role in individual variation among &quot;Pteranodon&quot; fossils, a follow-up of a 1987 paper he authored on the same subject. In the 1992 paper, he referred only to two species, &quot;P. longiceps&quot; and &quot;P. sternbergi&quot;. Two years later, he published a paper fully revising its taxonomy, wherein he concluded that only &quot;P. longiceps&quot; and &quot;P. sternbergi&quot; were valid species. &quot;P. marshi&quot; and &quot;P. walkeri&quot; were regarded as junior synonyms of &quot;P. longiceps&quot;, and &quot;P. eatoni&quot; as a junior synonym of &quot;P. stenbergi&quot;. The remainder were either rendered &quot;nomina dubia&quot; or placed in Nyctosaurus&quot;.&quot;

==Description==
=== Body size and sexual dimorphism ===
Adult male &quot;Pteranodon&quot; were among the largest pterosaurs, and were the largest flying animals known until the late 20th century, when the giant azhdarchid pterosaurs were discovered. The wingspan of an average adult male &quot;Pteranodon&quot; was . Adult females were much smaller, averaging in wingspan. A large specimen of &quot;Pteranodon longiceps&quot;, USNM 50130, is estimated to have a wingspan of , body length of and body mass of . Even larger specimens had wingspans of . Size aside, females were distinguished by their short, rounded head crests and wide pelvic canals, whereas had narrow hips and very large head crests, likely serving a display function.

Methods used to estimate the mass of large male &quot;Pteranodon&quot; specimens (those with wingspans of about 7 meters) have been notoriously unreliable, producing a wide range of estimates. In a review of pterosaur size estimates published in 2010, Mark Witton and Michael Habib argued that the largest estimate of is much too high and an upper limit of is more realistic. Witton and Habib considered the methods used by researchers who obtained smaller mass estimates equally flawed. Most have been produced by scaling modern animals such as bats and birds up to &quot;Pteranodon&quot; size, despite the fact that pterosaurs have vastly different body proportions and soft tissue anatomy from any living animal.

===Skull and beak===

Unlike earlier pterosaurs, such as &quot;Rhamphorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Pterodactylus&quot;, &quot;Pteranodon&quot; had toothless beaks, similar to those of birds. &quot;Pteranodon&quot; beaks were made of solid, bony margins that projected from the base of the jaws. The beaks were long, slender, and ended in thin, sharp points. The upper jaw, which was longer than the lower jaw, was curved upward; while this normally has been attributed only to the upward-curving beak, one specimen (UALVP 24238) has a curvature corresponding with the beak widening towards the tip. While the tip of the beak is not known in this specimen, the level of curvature suggests it would have been extremely long. The unique form of the beak in this specimen led Alexander Kellner to assign it to a distinct genus, &quot;Dawndraco&quot;, in 2010.

The most distinctive characteristic of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; is its cranial crest. These crests consisted of skull bones (frontals) projecting upward and backward from the skull. The size and shape of these crests varied due to a number of factors, including age, sex, and species. Male &quot;Pteranodon sternbergi&quot;, the older species of the two described to date, had a more vertical crest with a broad forward projection, while their descendants, &quot;Pteranodon longiceps&quot;, evolved a narrower, more backward-projecting crest. Females of both species were smaller and bore small, rounded crests. The crests were probably mainly display structures, though they may have had other functions as well.

=== Postcranial skeleton ===
The neural spines of &quot;Pteranodon&quot;&#x27;s vertebrae were narrow. Like many pterosaurs and birds, it possessed a notarium, a fused mass comprising the first six dorsal vertebrae. Similarly, the first few ribs were fused. The pelvic bones were fused to the synsacrum, a mass of vertebrae that included at least two dorsal vertebrae, the sacral vertebrae, and the first caudal vertebra. The sacrals were strengthened by bony ligaments. Beyond the synsacrum, the tail was relatively short, and the last few vertebrae were fused into a bony rod. The entire length of the tail was about 3.5% as long as the wingspan, or up to in the largest males. 

&quot;Pteranodon&quot;&#x27;s scapulae were oriented in such a way that each one braces the other, due to their fusion with the coracoids, providing increased integrity during flight. The humeri were extremely robust, with large, curved deltopectoral crests. The radius and ulna were similarly robust. The first three metacarpals were very slender, and their respective digits sported short, curved unguals (claws). &quot;Pteranodon&quot;&#x27;s hind feet had four metatarsals, which were tipped with less curved claws.

==Paleobiology==
===Flight===
The wing shape of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; suggests that it would have flown rather like a modern-day albatross. This is based on the fact that &quot;Pteranodon&quot; had a high aspect ratio (wingspan to chord length) similar to that of the albatross — 9:1 for &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, compared to 8:1 for an albatross. Albatrosses spend long stretches of time at sea fishing, and use a flight pattern called &quot;dynamic soaring&quot; which exploits the vertical gradient of wind speed near the ocean surface to travel long distances without flapping, and without the aid of thermals (which do not occur over the open ocean the same way they do over land). While most of a &quot;Pteranodon&quot; flight would have depended on soaring, like long-winged seabirds, it probably required an occasional active, rapid burst of flapping, and studies of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; wing loading (the strength of the wings vs. the weight of the body) indicate that they were capable of substantial flapping flight, contrary to some earlier suggestions that they were so big they could only glide. However, a more recent study suggests that it relied on thermal soaring, unlike modern seabirds but much like modern continental flyers and the extinct &quot;Pelagornis&quot;.

Like other pterosaurs, &quot;Pteranodon&quot; probably took off from a standing, quadrupedal position. Using their long forelimbs for leverage, they would have vaulted themselves into the air in a rapid leap. Almost all of the energy would have been generated by the forelimbs. The upstroke of the wings would have occurred when the animal cleared the ground followed by a rapid down-stroke to generate additional lift and complete the launch into the air. It is possible that &quot;Pteranodon&quot; could have achieved this from the water, as well as on land, which has been speculated for various other such as the distantly related &quot;Anhanguera&quot;.

===Locomotion===

Historically, terrestrial locomotion in &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, as in pterosaurs overall, has been the subject of debate, chiefly the matter of whether or not they were bipedal or quadrupedal. The earliest model of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; locomotion, put forward by Cherrie D. Bramwell and G. R. Whitfield, suggested that they were utterly incapable of walking or standing. Instead, they suggested that it moved on land by pushing itself around, and that it took off by perching on cliffsides and allowing the wind to take it. Subsequent works largely revolved around more conventional methods of locomotion, such as bipedalism and various kinds of quadrupedalism. In 2004, Sankar Chatterjee and R. J. Templin proposed a dual system, wherein pterosaurs walked quadrupedally most of the time, but opted for a bipedal takeoff. The latter, however, is unlikely. Trackways suggest that pterosaurs like &quot;Pteranodon&quot; were quadrupedal.

===Diet===
The diet of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; is known to have included fish; fossilized fish bones have been found in the stomach area of one &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, and a fossilized fish bolus has been found between the jaws of another &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, specimen AMNH 5098. Numerous other specimens also preserve fragments of fish scales and vertebrae near the torso, indicating that fish made up a majority of the diet of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; (though they may also have taken invertebrates).

Traditionally, most researchers have suggested that &quot;Pteranodon&quot; would have taken fish by dipping their beaks into the water while in low, soaring flight. However, this was probably based on the assumption that the animals could not take off from the water surface. It is more likely that &quot;Pteranodon&quot; could take off from the water, and would have dipped for fish while swimming rather than while flying. Even a small, female &quot;Pteranodon&quot; could have reached a depth of at least with its long bill and neck while floating on the surface, and they may have reached even greater depths by plunge-diving into the water from the air like some modern long-winged seabirds. In 1994, Bennett noted that the head, neck, and shoulders of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; were as heavily built as diving birds, and suggested that they could dive by folding back their wings like the modern gannet.

===Crest function===
&quot;Pteranodon&quot; was notable for its skull crest, though the function of this crest has been a subject of debate. Most explanations have focused on the blade-like, backward pointed crest of male &quot;P. longiceps&quot;, however, and ignored the wide range of variation across age and sex. The fact that the crests vary so much rules out most practical functions other than for use in mating displays. Therefore, display was probably the main function of the crest, and any other functions were secondary.

Scientific interpretations of the crest&#x27;s function began in 1910, when George Francis Eaton proposed two possibilities: an aerodynamic counterbalance and a muscle attachment point. He suggested that the crest might have anchored large, long jaw muscles, but admitted that this function alone could not explain the large size of some crests. Bennett (1992) agreed with Eaton&#x27;s own assessment that the crest was too large and variable to have been a muscle attachment site. Eaton had suggested that a secondary function of the crest might have been as a counterbalance against the long beak, reducing the need for heavy neck muscles to control the orientation of the head. Wind tunnel tests showed that the crest did function as an effective counterbalance to a degree, but Bennett noted that, again, the hypothesis focuses only on the long crests of male &quot;P. longiceps&quot;, not on the larger crests of &quot;P. sternbergi&quot; and very small crests that existed among the females. Bennett found that the crests of females had no counterbalancing effect, and that the crests of male &quot;P. sternbergi&quot; would, by themselves, have a negative effect on the balance of the head. In fact, side to side movement of the crests would have required more, not less, neck musculature to control balance.

In 1943, Dominik von Kripp suggested that the crest may have served as a rudder, an idea embraced by several later researchers. One researcher, Ross S. Stein, even suggested that the crest may have supported a membrane of skin connecting the backward-pointing crest to the neck and back, increasing its surface area and effectiveness as a rudder. The rudder hypothesis, again, does not take into account females nor &quot;P. sternbergi&quot;, which had an upward-pointing, not backward-pointing crest. Bennett also found that, even in its capacity as a rudder, the crest would not provide nearly so much directional force as simply maneuvering the wings. The suggestion that the crest was an air brake, and that the animals would turn their heads to the side in order to slow down, suffers from a similar problem. Additionally, the rudder and air brake hypotheses do not explain why such large variation exists in crest size even among adults.

Alexander Kellner suggested that the large crests of the pterosaur &quot;Tapejara&quot;, as well as other species, might be used for heat exchange, allowing these pterosaurs to absorb or shed heat and regulate body temperature, which also would account for the correlation between crest size and body size. There is no evidence of extra blood vessels in the crest for this purpose, however, and the large, membranous wings filled with blood vessels would have served that purpose much more effectively.

With these hypotheses ruled out, the best-supported hypothesis for crest function seems to be as a sexual display. This is consistent with the size variation seen in fossil specimens, where females and juveniles have small crests and males large, elaborate, variable crests.

===Sexual variation===
Adult &quot;Pteranodon&quot; specimens may be divided into two distinct size classes, small and large, with the large size class being about one and a half times larger than the small class, and the small class being twice as common as the large class. Both size classes lived alongside each other, and while researchers had previously suggested that they represent different species, Christopher Bennett showed that the differences between them are consistent with the concept that they represent females and males, and that &quot;Pteranodon&quot; species were sexually dimorphic. Skulls from the larger size class preserve large, upward and backward pointing crests, while the crests of the smaller size class are small and triangular. Some larger skulls also show evidence of a second crest that extended long and low, toward the tip of the beak, which is not seen in smaller specimens.

The gender of the different size classes was determined, not from the skulls, but from the pelvic bones. Contrary to what may be expected, the smaller size class had disproportionately large and wide-set pelvic bones. Bennett interpreted this as indicating a more spacious birth canal, through which eggs would pass. He concluded that the small size class with small, triangular crests represent females, and the larger, large-crested specimens represent males. The overall size and crest size also corresponds to age. Immature specimens are known from both females and males, and immature males often have small crests similar to adult females. Therefore, it seems that the large crests only developed in males when they reached their large, adult size, making the sex of immature specimens difficult to establish from partial remains.

The fact that females appear to have outnumbered males two to one suggests that, as with modern animals with size-related sexual dimorphism, such as sea lions and other pinnipeds, &quot;Pteranodon&quot; might have been polygynous, with a few males competing for association with groups consisting of large numbers of females. Similar to modern pinnipeds, &quot;Pteranodon&quot; may have competed to establish territory on rocky, offshore rookeries, with the largest, and largest-crested, males gaining the most territory and having more success mating with females. The crests of male &quot;Pteranodon&quot; would not have been used in competition, but rather as &quot;visual dominance-rank symbols&quot;, with display rituals taking the place of physical competition with other males. If this hypothesis is correct, it also is likely that male &quot;Pteranodon&quot; played little to no part in rearing the young; such a behavior is not found in the males of modern polygynous animals who father many offspring at the same time.

==Paleoecology==

Specimens assigned to &quot;Pteranodon&quot; have been found in both the Smoky Hill Chalk deposits of the Niobrara Formation, and the slightly younger Sharon Springs deposits of the Pierre Shale Formation. When &quot;Pteranodon&quot; was alive, this area was covered by a large inland sea, known as the Western Interior Seaway. Famous for fossils collected since 1870, these formations extend from as far south as Kansas in the United States to Manitoba in Canada. However, &quot;Pteranodon&quot; specimens (or any pterosaur specimens) have only been found in the southern half of the formation, in Kansas, Wyoming, and South Dakota. Despite the fact that numerous fossils have been found in the contemporary parts of the formation in Canada, no pterosaur specimens have ever been found there. This strongly suggests that the natural geographic range of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; covered only the southern part of the Niobrara, and that its habitat did not extend farther north than South Dakota.

Some very fragmentary fossils belonging to pteranodontian pterosaurs, and possibly &quot;Pteranodon&quot; itself, have also been found on the Gulf Coast and East Coast of the United States. For example, some bone fragments from the Mooreville Formation of Alabama and the Merchantville Formation of Delaware may have come from &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, though they are too incomplete to make a definite identification. Some remains from Japan have also been tentatively attributed to &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, but their distance from its known Western Interior Seaway habitat makes this identification unlikely.

&quot;Pteranodon longiceps&quot; would have shared the sky with the giant-crested pterosaur &quot;Nyctosaurus&quot;. Compared to &quot;P. longiceps&quot;, which was a very common species, &quot;Nyctosaurus&quot; was rare, making up only 3% of pterosaur fossils from the formation. Also less common was the early toothed bird, &quot;Ichthyornis&quot;. Below the surface, the sea was populated primarily by invertebrates such as ammonites and squid. Vertebrate life, apart from basal fish, included sea turtles, such as &quot;Toxochelys&quot;, the plesiosaurs &quot;Elasmosaurus&quot; and &quot;Styxosaurus&quot;, and the flightless diving bird &quot;Parahesperornis&quot;. Mosasaurs were the most common marine reptiles, with genera including &quot;Clidastes&quot;, &quot;Mosasaurus&quot; and &quot;Tylosaurus&quot;. At least some of these marine reptiles are known to have fed on &quot;Pteranodon&quot;. Barnum Brown, in 1904, reported plesiosaur stomach contents containing &quot;pterodactyl&quot; bones, most likely from &quot;Pteranodon&quot;. Fossils from terrestrial dinosaurs also have been found in the Niobrara Chalk, suggesting that animals who died on shore must have been washed out to sea (one specimen of a hadrosaur appears to have been scavenged by a shark).

It is likely that, as in other polygynous animals (in which males compete for association with harems of females), &quot;Pteranodon&quot; lived primarily on offshore rookeries, where they could nest away from land-based predators and feed far from shore; most &quot;Pteranodon&quot; fossils are found in locations which at the time, were hundreds of kilometres from the coastline.

==Classification==

===Timespan and evolution===

&quot;Pteranodon&quot; fossils are known primarily from the Niobrara Formation of the central United States. Broadly defined, &quot;Pteranodon&quot; existed for more than four million years, during the Santonian stage of the Cretaceous period. The genus is present in most layers of the Niobrara Formation except for the upper two; in 2003, Kenneth Carpenter surveyed the distribution and dating of fossils in this formation, demonstrating that &quot;Pteranodon sternbergi&quot; existed there from 88 to 85 million years ago, while &quot;P. longiceps&quot; existed between 86 and 84.5 million years ago. A possible third species, which Kellner named &quot;Geosternbergia maiseyi&quot; in 2010, is known from the Sharon Springs member of the Pierre Shale Formation in Kansas, Wyoming, and South Dakota, dating to between 81.5 and 80.5 million years ago.

In the early 1990s, Bennett noted that the two major morphs of pteranodont present in the Niobrara Formation were precisely separated in time with little, if any, overlap. Due to this, and to their gross overall similarity, he suggested that they probably represent chronospecies within a single evolutionary lineage lasting about 4 million years. In other words, only one species of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; would have been present at any one time, and &quot;P. sternbergi&quot; (or &quot;Geosternbergia&quot;) in all likelihood was the direct ancestor species of &quot;P. longiceps&quot;.

===Valid species===
Many researchers consider there to be at least two species of &quot;Pteranodon&quot;. However, aside from the differences between males and females described above, the post-cranial skeletons of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; show little to no variation between species or specimens, and the bodies and wings of all pteranodonts were essentially identical.

Two species of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; are traditionally recognized as valid: &quot;Pteranodon longiceps&quot;, the type species, and &quot;Pteranodon sternbergi&quot;. The species differ only in the shape of the crest in adult males (described above), and possibly in the angle of certain skull bones. Because well-preserved &quot;Pteranodon&quot; skull fossils are extremely rare, researchers use stratigraphy (i.e. which rock layer of the geologic formation a fossil is found in) to determine species identity in most cases.

&quot;Pteranodon sternbergi&quot; is the only known species of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; with an upright crest. The lower jaw of &quot;P. sternbergi&quot; was long. It was collected by George F. Sternberg in 1952 and described by John Christian Harksen in 1966, from the lower portion of the Niobrara Formation. It was older than &quot;P. longiceps&quot; and is considered by Bennett to be the direct ancestor of the later species.

Because fossils identifiable as &quot;P. sternbergi&quot; are found exclusively in the lower layers of the Niobrara Formation, and &quot;P. longiceps&quot; fossils exclusively in the upper layers, a fossil lacking the skull can be identified based on its position in the geologic column (though for many early fossil finds, precise data about its location was not recorded, rendering many fossils unidentifiable).

Below is a cladogram showing the phylogenetic placement of this genus within Pteranodontia from Andres and Myers (2013).

===Alternative classifications===

Due to the subtle variations between specimens of pteranodontid from the Niobrara Formation, most researchers have assigned all of them to the single genus &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, in at least two species (&quot;P. longiceps&quot; and &quot;P. sternbergi&quot;) distinguished mainly by the shape of the crest. However, the classification of these two forms has varied from researcher to researcher. In 1972, Halsey Wilkinson Miller published a paper arguing that the various forms of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; were different enough to be placed in distinct subgenera. He named these &quot;Pteranodon (Occidentalia) occidentalis&quot; (for the now-disused species &quot;P. occidentalis&quot;) and &quot;Pteranodon (Sternbergia) sternbergi&quot;. However, the name &quot;Sternbergia&quot; was preoccupied, and in 1978 Miller re-named the species &quot;Pteranodon (Geosternbergia) sternbergi&quot;, and named a third subgenus/species combination for &quot;P. longiceps&quot;, as &quot;Pteranodon (Longicepia) longiceps&quot;. Most prominent pterosaur researchers of the late 20th century however, including S. Christopher Bennett and Peter Wellnhofer, did not adopt these subgeneric names, and continued to place all pteranodont species into the single genus &quot;Pteranodon&quot;.

In 2010, pterosaur researcher Alexander Kellner revisited H.W. Miller&#x27;s classification. Kellner followed Miller&#x27;s opinion that the differences between the &quot;Pteranodon&quot; species were great enough to place them into different genera. He placed &quot;P. sternbergi&quot; into the genus named by Miller, &quot;Geosternbergia&quot;, along with the Pierre Shale skull specimen which Bennett had previously considered to be a large male &quot;P. longiceps&quot;. Kellner argued that this specimen&#x27;s crest, though incompletely preserved, was most similar to &quot;Geosternbergia&quot;. Because the specimen was millions of years younger than any known &quot;Geosternbergia&quot;, he assigned it to the new species &quot;Geosternbergia maiseyi&quot;. Numerous other pteranodont specimens are known from the same formation and time period, and Kellner suggested they may belong to the same species as &quot;G. maiseyi&quot;, but because they lack skulls, he could not confidently identify them. However, both species previously referred to &quot;Geosternbergia&quot; were separately included as those of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; (&quot;P. sternbergi&quot; and &quot;P. maiseyi&quot;) based on phylogenetic analysis in 2024.

===Disused species===
A number of additional species of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; have been named since the 1870s, although most now are considered to be junior synonyms of two or three valid species. The best-supported is the type species, &quot;P. longiceps&quot;, based on the well-preserved specimen including the first-known skull found by S. W. Williston. This individual had a wingspan of . Other valid species include the possibly larger &quot;P. sternbergi&quot;, with a wingspan originally estimated at . &quot;P. oweni&quot; (&quot;P. occidentalis&quot;), &quot;P. velox&quot;, &quot;P. umbrosus&quot;, &quot;P. harpyia&quot;, and &quot;P. comptus&quot; are considered to be &quot;nomina dubia&quot; by Bennett (1994) and others who question their validity. All probably are synonymous with the more well-known species.

Because the key distinguishing characteristic Marsh noted for &quot;Pteranodon&quot; was its lack of teeth, any toothless pterosaur jaw fragment, wherever it was found in the world, tended to be attributed to &quot;Pteranodon&quot; during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This resulted in a plethora of species and a great deal of confusion. The name became a wastebasket taxon, rather like the dinosaur &quot;Megalosaurus&quot;, to label any pterosaur remains that could not be distinguished other than by the absence of teeth. Species (often dubious ones now known to be based on sexual variation or juvenile characters) have been reclassified a number of times, and several subgenera have in the 1970s been erected by Halsey Wilkinson Miller to hold them in various combinations, further confusing the taxonomy (subgenera include &quot;Longicepia&quot;, &quot;Occidentalia&quot;, and &quot;Geosternbergia&quot;). Notable authors who have discussed the various aspects of &quot;Pteranodon&quot; include Bennett, Padian, Unwin, Kellner, and Wellnhofer. Two species, &quot;P. oregonensis&quot; and &quot;P. orientalis&quot;, are not pteranodontids and have been renamed &quot;Bennettazhia oregonensis&quot; and &quot;Bogolubovia orientalis&quot; respectively.

<doc id="24826" wikidata="Q1194697" url="?curid=24826" title="Passive voice">
<text>A passive voice construction is a grammatical voice construction that is found in many languages. In a clause with passive voice, the grammatical subject expresses the &quot;theme&quot; or &quot;patient&quot; of the main verb – that is, the person or thing that undergoes the action or has its state changed. This contrasts with active voice, in which the subject has the agent role. For example, in the passive sentence &quot;The tree was pulled down&quot;, the subject (&quot;the tree&quot;) denotes the patient rather than the agent of the action. In contrast, the sentences &quot;Someone pulled down the tree&quot; and &quot;The tree is down&quot; are active sentences.

Typically, in passive clauses, what is usually expressed by the object (or sometimes another argument) of the verb is now expressed by the subject, while what is usually expressed by the subject is either omitted or is indicated by some adjunct of the clause. Thus, turning an active sense of a verb into a passive sense is a valence-decreasing process (&quot;detransitivizing process&quot;), because it syntactically turns a transitive sense into an intransitive sense. This is not always the case; for example in Japanese a passive-voice construction does not necessarily decrease valence.

Many languages have both an active and a passive voice; this allows for greater flexibility in sentence construction, as either the semantic agent or patient may take the syntactic role of subject. The use of passive voice allows speakers to organize stretches of discourse by placing figures other than the agent in subject position. This may be done to foreground the patient, recipient, or other thematic role; it may also be useful when the semantic patient is the topic of on-going discussion. The passive voice may also be used to avoid specifying the agent of an action.

==Passive marking==
Different languages use various grammatical forms to indicate passive voice.

In some languages, passive voice is indicated by verb conjugation, specific forms of the verb. Examples of languages that indicate voice through conjugation include Greek, Latin, and North Germanic languages such as Swedish.

Norwegian (Nynorsk) and Icelandic have a similar system, but the usage of the passive is more restricted. The passive forms in Nynorsk are restricted to being accompanied by an auxiliary verb, which is not the case in Swedish and Danish.

Nynorsk uses &quot;å verte&quot; or &quot;å bli&quot; + past participle for passive voice, and Swedish and Danish use the passive suffix &quot;-s&quot; and Icelandic uses &quot;að verða&quot; or &quot;að vera&quot; + past participle or &quot;-st&quot; suffix for middle voice. 

In Latin, the agent of a passive sentence (if indicated) is expressed using a noun in the ablative case, in this case (the ablative of ). Different languages use different methods for expressing the agent in passive clauses. In Swedish, the agent can be expressed by means of a prepositional phrase with the preposition (equivalent here to the English &quot;by&quot;).

The Austronesian language Kimaragang Dusun also indicates passive voice by verb conjugation using the infix, .
Other languages, including English, express the passive voice periphrastically, using an auxiliary verb.

===In English===

English, like some other languages, uses a periphrastic passive. Rather than conjugating directly for voice, English uses the past participle form of the verb plus an auxiliary verb, either &quot;be&quot; or &quot;get&quot; (called linking verbs in traditional grammar), to indicate passive voice.
*The money was donated to the school.
*The vase got broken during the fight.
*All men are created equal.

If the agent is mentioned, it usually appears in a prepositional phrase introduced by the preposition &quot;by&quot;.
*Without agent: The paper was marked.
*With agent: The paper was marked by Mr. Tan.

The subject of the passive voice usually corresponds to the direct object of the corresponding active-voice formulation (as in the above examples), but English also allows passive constructions in which the subject corresponds to an indirect object or preposition complement:
*We were given tickets. (subject &quot;we&quot; corresponds to the indirect object of &quot;give&quot;)
*Tim was operated on yesterday. (subject &quot;Tim&quot; corresponds to the complement of the preposition &quot;on&quot;)
In sentences of the second type, a stranded preposition is left. This is called the &quot;prepositional passive&quot; or &quot;pseudo-passive&quot; (although the latter term can also be used with other meanings).

The active voice is the dominant voice used in English. Many commentators, notably George Orwell in his essay &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot; and Strunk &amp; White in &quot;The Elements of Style&quot;, have urged minimizing use of the passive voice, but this is almost always based on these commentators&#x27; misunderstanding of what the passive voice is. Contrary to common critiques, the passive voice has important uses, with virtually all writers using the passive voice (including Orwell and Strunk &amp; White).
There is general agreement that the passive voice is useful for emphasis or when the receiver of the action is more important than the actor.

&quot;Merriam–Webster&#x27;s Dictionary of English Usage&quot; refers to three statistical studies of passive versus active sentences in various periodicals, stating: &quot;the highest incidence of passive constructions was 13 percent. Orwell runs to a little over 20 percent in &quot;Politics and the English Language&quot;. Clearly he found the construction useful in spite of his advice to avoid it as much as possible&quot;.

==Defining &quot;passive&quot;==
In the field of linguistics, the term &quot;passive&quot; is applied to a wide range of grammatical structures. Linguists therefore find it difficult to define the term in a way that makes sense across all human languages. The canonical passive in European languages has the following properties:
# The subject is not an agent.
# There is a change in: word order; or in nominal morphology—the form of the nouns in the sentence.
# There is specific verbal morphology—a particular form of the verb indicates passive voice.
The problem arises with non-European languages. Many constructions in these languages share at least one property with the canonical European passive, but not all. While it seems justified to call these constructions &quot;passive&quot; when comparing them to European languages&#x27; passive constructions, as a whole the passives of the world&#x27;s languages do not share a single common feature.

R. M. W. Dixon has defined four criteria for determining whether a construction is a passive:
# It applies to underlying transitive clauses and forms a derived intransitive.
# The entity that is the patient or the object of the transitive verb in the underlying representation (indicated as &quot;O&quot; in linguistic terminology) becomes the core argument of the clause (indicated as &quot;S&quot;, since the core argument is the subject of an intransitive).
# The agent in the underlying representation (indicated as &quot;A&quot;) becomes a chômeur, a noun in the periphery that is not a core argument. It is marked by a non-core case or becomes part of an adpositional phrase, etc. This can be omitted, but there is always the option of including it.
# There is some explicit marking of the construction.
Dixon acknowledges that this excludes some constructions labeled as &quot;passive&quot; by some linguists.

==Adversative passive==
In some languages, including several Southeast Asian languages, the passive voice is sometimes used to indicate that an action or event was unpleasant or undesirable. This so-called &quot;adversative passive&quot; works like the ordinary passive voice in terms of syntactic structure—that is, a theme or instrument acts as subject. In addition, the construction indicates adversative affect, suggesting that someone was negatively affected.

In Japanese, for example, the adversative passive (also called indirect passive) indicates adversative affect. The indirect or adversative passive has the same form as the direct passive. Unlike the direct passive, the indirect passive may be used with intransitive verbs.
Yup&#x27;ik, from the Eskimo–Aleut family, has two different suffixes that can indicate passive, &quot;-cir-&quot; and &quot;-ma-&quot;. The morpheme &quot;-cir-&quot; has an adversative meaning. If an agent is included in a passive sentence with the &quot;-cir&quot; passive, the noun is usually in the allative (oblique) case.
==Stative and dynamic passive==
In some languages, for example English, there is often a similarity between clauses expressing an action or event in the passive voice and clauses expressing a state. For example, the string of words &quot;The dog is fed&quot; can have the following two different meanings:
# The dog is fed (twice a day).
# The dog is fed (so we can leave now).
The additions in parentheses &quot;force&quot; the same string of words to clearly show only one of their two possible grammatical functions and the related meaning. In the first sentence, the combination of the auxiliary verb &quot;is&quot; and the past participle &quot;fed&quot; is a regular example of the construction of the passive voice in English. In the second sentence, &quot;is&quot; can however be interpreted as an ordinary copula and the past participle as an adjective.

Sentences of the second type are called &quot;false passives&quot; by some linguists, who feel that such sentences are simply confused with the passive voice due to their outward similarity. Other linguists consider the second type to be a different kind of passive – a &quot;stative passive&quot; (rarely called &quot;statal&quot;, &quot;static&quot;, or &quot;resultative passive&quot;), in contrast to the &quot;dynamic&quot; or &quot;eventive&quot; passive illustrated by the first sentence. Some languages express or can express these different meanings using different constructions.

The difference between dynamic and stative passives is more evident in languages such as German that use different words or constructions for the two. In German, the auxiliary verb marks static passive (German: , rarely , in referring to German also called or ), while marks the dynamic passive ( or , rarely , in referring to German also called or or simply or ).
The English string of words &quot;the lawn is mown&quot; has two possible meanings corresponding to the example &quot;the dog is fed&quot; above. It can be used in the following two different senses:
# dynamic: &quot;The lawn is mown (once a week).&quot; 
# stative: &quot;The lawn is mown (so they&#x27;re probably not gone.)&quot;
German uses two different grammatical constructions for these sentences:
# dynamic: 
# stative: 

Further examples and explanations:
# dynamic: (&quot;The lawn is being mown right now&quot; / &quot;The lawn is mown often&quot;, literally &quot;The lawn gets mown right now / often&quot;, dynamic)
# stative: (&quot;The lawn is [already] mown.&quot;)

A number of German verbs such as (&quot;cover&quot;), (&quot;fill&quot;), and (&quot;separate&quot;), when used as stative verbs, usually only form static passives.
:- (&quot;Snow covers the ground&quot;, active)
:- (&quot;The ground is covered with snow&quot;, static)
:- rare, poetic: (&quot;The ground is being covered with snow&quot;, dynamic)
:- but not: * (The English equivalent would be equally incorrect: *&quot;The street is being covered with rubble.&quot;) 
:- correct: (&quot;The street is covered with rubble.&quot;)

In English, the passive voice expressed with the auxiliary verb &quot;get&quot; rather than &quot;be&quot; (&quot;get-passive&quot;) expresses a dynamic rather than a static meaning. But when the auxiliary verb &quot;be&quot; is used, the main verb can have either a dynamic or static meaning as shown below (including copies of some examples from above):

:The dog &quot;gets fed&quot; twice a day. (dynamic)
:The dog &quot;is fed&quot; (twice a day). (dynamic)
:The dog &quot;is fed&quot; (so we can leave now). (stative)
:The couple &quot;got married&quot; last spring. (dynamic)
:The marriage &quot;was celebrated&quot; last spring. (dynamic)
:It &quot;is agreed&quot; that laws were invented for the safety of citizens. (stative)

Verbs that typically express static meaning can show dynamic meaning when used in the passive formed with &quot;get&quot;, for example &quot;be known&quot; (static) vs. &quot;get known&quot; (dynamic):

:Zoltan &quot;is known&quot; for hosting big parties. (static)
:Get your foot in the door, &quot;get known&quot;. (dynamic)

<text>In computability theory, a primitive recursive function is, roughly speaking, a function that can be computed by a computer program whose loops are all &quot;for&quot; loops (that is, an upper bound of the number of iterations of every loop is fixed before entering the loop). Primitive recursive functions form a strict subset of those general recursive functions that are also total functions. 

The importance of primitive recursive functions lies in the fact that most computable functions that are studied in number theory (and more generally in mathematics) are primitive recursive. For example, addition and division, the factorial and exponential function, and the function which returns the &quot;n&quot;th prime are all primitive recursive. In fact, for showing that a computable function is primitive recursive, it suffices to show that its time complexity is bounded above by a primitive recursive function of the input size. It is hence not particularly easy to devise a computable function that is &quot;not&quot; primitive recursive; some examples are shown in section below.

The set of primitive recursive functions is known as PR in computational complexity theory.

== Definition ==

A primitive recursive function takes a fixed number of arguments, each a natural number (nonnegative integer: {0, 1, 2, ...}), and returns a natural number. If it takes &quot;n&quot; arguments it is called &quot;n&quot;-ary.

The basic primitive recursive functions are given by these axioms:

{=}\ n&lt;/math&gt;, is primitive recursive.

| 2=&quot;Successor function&quot;: The 1-ary successor function &quot;S&quot;, which returns the successor of its argument (see Peano postulates), that is, formula_1, is primitive recursive.

| 3=&quot;Projection functions&quot; formula_2: For all natural numbers formula_3 such that formula_4, the &quot;k&quot;-ary function defined by formula_5 is primitive recursive.

More complex primitive recursive functions can be obtained by applying the operations given by these axioms:

{=}\ f, \quad\text{where}\quad f(x_1,\ldots,x_k) = h(g_1(x_1,\ldots,x_k),\ldots,g_m(x_1,\ldots,x_k)).&lt;/math&gt; For formula_6, the ordinary function composition formula_7 is obtained.

| 5=&quot;Primitive recursion operator&quot; formula_8: Given the &quot;k&quot;-ary function formula_9 and the (&quot;k&quot; + 2)-ary function formula_10:formula_11
&quot;Interpretation:&quot;
The function formula_12 acts as a for-loop from formula_13 up to the value of its first argument. The rest of the arguments for formula_12, denoted here with formula_15, are a set of initial conditions for the for-loop which may be used by it during calculations but which are immutable by it. The functions formula_16 and formula_17 on the right-hand side of the equations that define formula_12 represent the body of the loop, which performs calculations. The function formula_16 is used only once to perform initial calculations. Calculations for subsequent steps of the loop are performed by formula_17. The first parameter of formula_17 is fed the &quot;current&quot; value of the for-loop&#x27;s index. The second parameter of formula_17 is fed the result of the for-loop&#x27;s previous calculations, from previous steps. The rest of the parameters for formula_17 are those immutable initial conditions for the for-loop mentioned earlier. They may be used by formula_17 to perform calculations but they will not themselves be altered by formula_17.

The primitive recursive functions are the basic functions and those obtained from the basic functions by applying these operations a finite number of times.

== Examples ==

===Addition===

A definition of the 2-ary function formula_26, to compute the sum of its arguments, can be obtained using the primitive recursion operator formula_8. To this end, the well-known equations 
:formula_28
are &quot;rephrased in primitive recursive function terminology&quot;: In the definition of formula_29, the first equation suggests to choose formula_30 to obtain formula_31; the second equation suggests to choose formula_32 to obtain formula_33. Therefore, the addition function can be defined as formula_34. As a computation example,
:formula_35

===Doubling===

Given formula_26, the 1-ary function formula_37 doubles its argument, formula_38.

===Multiplication===

In a similar way as addition, multiplication can be defined by formula_39. This reproduces the well-known multiplication equations: 
:formula_40 
and 
:formula_41

===Predecessor===

The predecessor function acts as the &quot;opposite&quot; of the successor function and is recursively defined by the rules formula_42 and formula_43. A primitive recursive definition is formula_44. As a computation example,
:formula_45

===Truncated subtraction===

The limited subtraction function (also called &quot;monus&quot;, and denoted &quot;formula_46&quot;) is definable from the predecessor function. It satisfies the equations 
:formula_47
Since the recursion runs over the second argument, we begin with a primitive recursive definition of the reversed subtraction, formula_48. Its recursion then runs over the first argument, so its primitive recursive definition can be obtained, similar to addition, as formula_49. To get rid of the reversed argument order, then define formula_50. As a computation example,
:formula_51

=== Converting predicates to numeric functions ===

In some settings it is natural to consider primitive recursive functions that take as inputs tuples that mix numbers with truth values (that is formula_52 for true and formula_12 for false), or that produce truth values as outputs. This can be accomplished by identifying the truth values with numbers in any fixed manner. For example, it is common to identify the truth value formula_52 with the number formula_55 and the truth value formula_12 with the number formula_13. Once this identification has been made, the characteristic function of a set formula_58, which always returns formula_55 or formula_13, can be viewed as a predicate that tells whether a number is in the set formula_58. Such an identification of predicates with numeric functions will be assumed for the remainder of this article.

=== Predicate &quot;Is zero&quot; ===

As an example for a primitive recursive predicate, the 1-ary function formula_62 shall be defined such that formula_63 if formula_64, and 
formula_65, otherwise. This can be achieved by defining formula_66. Then, formula_67 and e.g. formula_68.

=== Predicate &quot;Less or equal&quot; ===

Using the property formula_69, the 2-ary function formula_70 can be defined by formula_71. Then formula_72 if formula_73, and formula_74, otherwise. As a computation example,
:formula_75

=== Predicate &quot;Greater or equal&quot; ===

Once a definition of formula_70 is obtained, the converse predicate can be defined as formula_77. Then, formula_78 is true (more precisely: has value 1) if, and only if, formula_79.

=== If-then-else ===

The 3-ary if-then-else operator known from programming languages can be defined by formula_80. Then, for arbitrary formula_81,
:formula_82
and 
:formula_83.
That is, formula_84 returns the then-part, formula_85, if the if-part, formula_81, is true, and the else-part, formula_87, otherwise.

=== Junctors ===

Based on the formula_88 function, it is easy to define logical junctors. For example, defining formula_89, one obtains formula_90, that is, formula_91 is true if, and only if, both formula_81 and formula_85 are true (logical conjunction of formula_81 and formula_85).

Similarly, formula_96 and formula_97 lead to appropriate definitions of disjunction and negation: formula_98 and formula_99.

=== Equality predicate ===

Using the above functions formula_70, formula_101 and formula_102, the definition formula_103 implements the equality predicate. In fact, formula_104 is true if, and only if, formula_81 equals formula_85.

Similarly, the definition formula_107 implements the predicate &quot;less-than&quot;, and formula_108 implements &quot;greater-than&quot;.

=== Other operations on natural numbers ===

Exponentiation and primality testing are primitive recursive. Given primitive recursive functions formula_109, formula_12, formula_16, and formula_17, a function that returns the value of formula_16 when formula_114 and the value of formula_17 otherwise is primitive recursive.

=== Operations on integers and rational numbers ===

By using Gödel numberings, the primitive recursive functions can be extended to operate on other objects such as integers and rational numbers. If integers are encoded by Gödel numbers in a standard way, the arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, and multiplication are all primitive recursive. Similarly, if the rationals are represented by Gödel numbers then the field operations are all primitive recursive.

=== Some common primitive recursive functions ===
The following examples and definitions are from . Many appear with proofs. Most also appear with similar names, either as proofs or as examples, in they add the logarithm lo(x, y) or lg(x, y) depending on the exact derivation.

In the following the mark &quot; &#x27; &quot;, e.g. a&#x27;, is the primitive mark meaning &quot;the successor of&quot;, usually thought of as &quot; +1&quot;, e.g. a +1 =def a&#x27;. The functions 16–20 and #G are of particular interest with respect to converting primitive recursive predicates to, and extracting them from, their &quot;arithmetical&quot; form expressed as Gödel numbers.

:# Addition: a+b
:# Multiplication: a×b
:# Exponentiation: ab
:# Factorial a! : 0! = 1, a&#x27;! = a!×a&#x27;
:# pred(a): (Predecessor or decrement): If a &gt; 0 then a−1 else 0
:# Proper subtraction a ∸ b: If a ≥ b then a−b else 0
:# Minimum(a1, ... an)
:# Maximum(a1, ... an)
:# Absolute difference: | a−b | =def (a ∸ b) + (b ∸ a)
:# ~sg(a): NOT[signum(a)]: If a=0 then 1 else 0
:# sg(a): signum(a): If a=0 then 0 else 1
:# a | b: (a divides b): If b=k×a for some k then 0 else 1
:# Remainder(a, b): the leftover if b does not divide a &quot;evenly&quot;. Also called MOD(a, b)
:# a = b: sg | a − b | (Kleene&#x27;s convention was to represent &quot;true&quot; by 0 and &quot;false&quot; by 1; presently, especially in computers, the most common convention is the reverse, namely to represent &quot;true&quot; by 1 and &quot;false&quot; by 0, which amounts to changing sg into ~sg here and in the next item)
:# a &lt; b: sg( a&#x27; ∸ b )
:# Pr(a): a is a prime number Pr(a) =def a&gt;1 &amp; NOT(Exists c)1&lt;c&lt;a [ c|a ]
:# pi: the i+1th prime number
:# (a)i: exponent of pi in a: the unique x such that pix|a &amp; NOT(pix&#x27;|a)
:# lh(a): the &quot;length&quot; or number of non-vanishing exponents in a
:# lo(a, b): (logarithm of a to base b): If a, b &gt; 1 then the greatest x such that bx | a else 0

: &quot;In the following, the abbreviation x =def x1, ... xn; subscripts may be applied if the meaning requires.&quot;

* #A: A function φ definable explicitly from functions Ψ and constants q1, ... qn is primitive recursive in Ψ.
* #B: The finite sum Σy&lt;z ψ(x, y) and product Πy&lt;zψ(x, y) are primitive recursive in ψ.
* #C: A &quot;predicate&quot; P obtained by substituting functions χ1..., χm for the respective variables of a predicate Q is primitive recursive in χ1..., χm, Q.
* #D: The following &quot;predicates&quot; are primitive recursive in Q and R:
::* NOT_Q(x) .
::* Q OR R: Q(x) V R(x),
::* Q AND R: Q(x) &amp; R(x),
::* Q IMPLIES R: Q(x) → R(x)
::* Q is equivalent to R: Q(x) ≡ R(x)
* #E: The following &quot;predicates&quot; are primitive recursive in the &quot;predicate&quot; R:
::* (Ey)y&lt;z R(x, y) where (Ey)y&lt;z denotes &quot;there exists at least one y that is less than z such that&quot;
::* (y)y&lt;z R(x, y) where (y)y&lt;z denotes &quot;for all y less than z it is true that&quot;
::* μyy&lt;z R(x, y). The operator μyy&lt;z R(x, y) is a &quot;bounded&quot; form of the so-called minimization- or mu-operator: Defined as &quot;the least value of y less than z such that R(x, y) is true; or z if there is no such value.&quot;
* #F: Definition by cases: The function defined thus, where Q1, ..., Qm are mutually exclusive &quot;predicates&quot; (or &quot;ψ(x) shall have the value given by the first clause that applies), is primitive recursive in φ1, ..., Q1, ... Qm:
:: φ(x) =
::* φ1(x) if Q1(x) is true,
::* φm(x) if Qm(x) is true
::* φm+1(x) otherwise
* #G: If φ satisfies the equation:
:: φ(y,x) = χ(y, COURSE-φ(y; x2, ... xn ), x2, ... xn then φ is primitive recursive in χ. The value COURSE-φ(y; x2 to n ) of the course-of-values function encodes the sequence of values φ(0,x2 to n), ..., φ(y-1,x2 to n) of the original function.

== Relationship to recursive functions ==

The broader class of partial recursive functions is defined by introducing an unbounded search operator. The use of this operator may result in a partial function, that is, a relation with &quot;at most&quot; one value for each argument, but does not necessarily have &quot;any&quot; value for any argument (see domain). An equivalent definition states that a partial recursive function is one that can be computed by a Turing machine. A total recursive function is a partial recursive function that is defined for every input.

Every primitive recursive function is total recursive, but not all total recursive functions are primitive recursive. The Ackermann function &quot;A&quot;(&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) is a well-known example of a total recursive function (in fact, provable total), that is not primitive recursive. There is a characterization of the primitive recursive functions as a subset of the total recursive functions using the Ackermann function. This characterization states that a function is primitive recursive if and only if there is a natural number &quot;m&quot; such that the function can be computed by a Turing machine that always halts within A(&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) or fewer steps, where &quot;n&quot; is the sum of the arguments of the primitive recursive function.

An important property of the primitive recursive functions is that they are a recursively enumerable subset of the set of all total recursive functions (which is not itself recursively enumerable). This means that there is a single computable function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) that enumerates the primitive recursive functions, namely:
* For every primitive recursive function &quot;g&quot;, there is an &quot;m&quot; such that &quot;g&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) for all &quot;n&quot;, and
* For every &quot;m&quot;, the function &quot;h&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) is primitive recursive.
&quot;f&quot; can be explicitly constructed by iteratively repeating all possible ways of creating primitive recursive functions. Thus, it is provably total. One can use a diagonalization argument to show that &quot;f&quot; is not recursive primitive in itself: had it been such, so would be &quot;h&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;n&quot;)+1. But if this equals some primitive recursive function, there is an &quot;m&quot; such that &quot;h&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) for all &quot;n&quot;, and then &quot;h&quot;(&quot;m&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;m&quot;,&quot;m&quot;), leading to contradiction.

However, the set of primitive recursive functions is not the &quot;largest&quot; recursively enumerable subset of the set of all total recursive functions. For example, the set of provably total functions (in Peano arithmetic) is also recursively enumerable, as one can enumerate all the proofs of the theory. While all primitive recursive functions are provably total, the converse is not true.

== Limitations ==

Primitive recursive functions tend to correspond very closely with our intuition of what a computable function must be. Certainly the initial functions are intuitively computable (in their very simplicity), and the two operations by which one can create new primitive recursive functions are also very straightforward. However, the set of primitive recursive functions does not include every possible total computable function—this can be seen with a variant of Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument. This argument provides a total computable function that is not primitive recursive. A sketch of the proof is as follows:

This argument can be applied to any class of computable (total) functions that can be enumerated in this way, as explained in the article Machine that always halts. Note however that the &quot;partial&quot; computable functions (those that need not be defined for all arguments) can be explicitly enumerated, for instance by enumerating Turing machine encodings.

Other examples of total recursive but not primitive recursive functions are known:
*The function that takes &quot;m&quot; to Ackermann(&quot;m&quot;,&quot;m&quot;) is a unary total recursive function that is not primitive recursive.
*The Paris–Harrington theorem involves a total recursive function that is not primitive recursive.
*The Sudan function
*The Goodstein function

==Variants==
===Constant functions===
Instead of formula_116,
alternative definitions use just one 0-ary &quot;zero function&quot; formula_117 as a primitive function that always returns zero, and built the constant functions from the zero function, the successor function and the composition operator.

=== Iterative functions ===
Robinson considered various restrictions of the recursion rule. One is the so-called &quot;iteration rule&quot; where the function &quot;h&quot; does not have access to the parameters &quot;xi&quot; (in this case, we may assume without loss of generality that the function &quot;g&quot; is just the identity, as the general case can be obtained by substitution):
:formula_118
He proved that the class of all primitive recursive functions can still be obtained in this way.

=== Pure recursion ===
Another restriction considered by Robinson is &quot;pure recursion&quot;, where &quot;h&quot; does not have access to the induction variable &quot;y&quot;:
:formula_119
Gladstone proved that this rule is enough to generate all primitive recursive functions. Gladstone improved this so that even the combination of these two restrictions, i.e., the &quot;pure iteration&quot; rule below, is enough:
:formula_120
Further improvements are possible: Severin prove that even the pure iteration rule &quot;without parameters&quot;, namely
:formula_121
suffices to generate all unary primitive recursive functions if we extend the set of initial functions with truncated subtraction &quot;x ∸ y&quot;. We get &quot;all&quot; primitive recursive functions if we additionally include + as an initial function.

=== Additional primitive recursive forms ===

Some additional forms of recursion also define functions that are in fact
primitive recursive. Definitions in these forms may be easier to find or
more natural for reading or writing. Course-of-values recursion defines primitive recursive functions. Some forms of mutual recursion also define primitive recursive functions.

The functions that can be programmed in the LOOP programming language are exactly the primitive recursive functions. This gives a different characterization of the power of these functions. The main limitation of the LOOP language, compared to a Turing-complete language, is that in the LOOP language the number of times that each loop will run is specified before the loop begins to run.

=== Computer language definition ===

An example of a primitive recursive programming language is one that contains basic arithmetic operators (e.g. + and −, or ADD and SUBTRACT), conditionals and comparison (IF-THEN, EQUALS, LESS-THAN), and bounded loops, such as the basic for loop, where there is a known or calculable upper bound to all loops (FOR i FROM 1 TO n, with neither i nor n modifiable by the loop body). No control structures of greater generality, such as while loops or IF-THEN plus GOTO, are admitted in a primitive recursive language. 

The LOOP language, introduced in a 1967 paper by Albert R. Meyer and Dennis M. Ritchie, is such a language. Its computing power coincides with the primitive recursive functions. A variant of the LOOP language is Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s BlooP in &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;. Adding unbounded loops (WHILE, GOTO) makes the language general recursive and Turing-complete, as are all real-world computer programming languages.

The definition of primitive recursive functions implies that their computation halts on every input (after a finite number of steps). On the other hand, the halting problem is undecidable for general recursive functions.

== Finitism and consistency results ==

The primitive recursive functions are closely related to mathematical finitism, and are used in several contexts in mathematical logic where a particularly constructive system is desired. Primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA), a formal axiom system for the natural numbers and the primitive recursive functions on them, is often used for this purpose.

PRA is much weaker than Peano arithmetic, which is not a finitistic system. Nevertheless, many results in number theory and in proof theory can be proved in PRA. For example, Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem can be formalized into PRA, giving the following theorem:
:If &quot;T&quot; is a theory of arithmetic satisfying certain hypotheses, with Gödel sentence &quot;G&quot;&quot;T&quot;, then PRA proves the implication Con(&quot;T&quot;)→&quot;G&quot;&quot;T&quot;.
Similarly, many of the syntactic results in proof theory can be proved in PRA, which implies that there are primitive recursive functions that carry out the corresponding syntactic transformations of proofs.

In proof theory and set theory, there is an interest in finitistic consistency proofs, that is, consistency proofs that themselves are finitistically acceptable. Such a proof establishes that the consistency of a theory &quot;T&quot; implies the consistency of a theory &quot;S&quot; by producing a primitive recursive function that can transform any proof of an inconsistency from &quot;S&quot; into a proof of an inconsistency from &quot;T&quot;. One sufficient condition for a consistency proof to be finitistic is the ability to formalize it in PRA. For example, many consistency results in set theory that are obtained by forcing can be recast as syntactic proofs that can be formalized in PRA.

== History ==
Recursive definitions had been used more or less formally in mathematics before, but the construction of primitive recursion is traced back to Richard Dedekind&#x27;s theorem 126 of his &quot;Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?&quot; (1888). This work was the first to give a proof that a certain recursive construction defines a unique function.

Primitive recursive arithmetic was first proposed by Thoralf Skolem in 1923.

The current terminology was coined by Rózsa Péter (1934) after Ackermann had proved in 1928 that the function which today is named after him was not primitive recursive, an event which prompted the need to rename what until then were simply called recursive functions.

<doc id="24833" wikidata="Q274948" url="?curid=24833" title="Prime Minister of Japan">
<text>The is the head of government of Japan. The prime minister chairs the Cabinet of Japan and has the ability to select and dismiss its ministers of state. The prime minister also serves as the commander-in-chief of the Japan Self Defence Forces and is a sitting member of either house of the National Diet (typically the House of Representatives). 

The emperor appoints as prime minister the person who is nominated by the National Diet (the parliament). The prime minister must retain the confidence of the House of Representatives to remain in office. The prime minister lives and works at the Naikaku Sōri Daijin Kantei (Prime Minister&#x27;s Official Residence) in Nagatachō, Chiyoda, Tokyo, close to the National Diet Building. 

Sixty-five men have served as prime minister, the first of whom was Itō Hirobumi taking office on 22 December 1885. The longest-serving prime minister was Shinzo Abe, who served over eight years, and the shortest-serving was Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, who served fifty-four days. The current prime minister is Shigeru Ishiba, who succeeded Fumio Kishida on 1 October 2024, following the 2024 Liberal Democratic Party presidential election.

== Designation ==
=== Abbreviations ===
In Japanese, due to the special nature of the work of the head of government, the prime minister&#x27;s titles vary depending on context, sometimes demonstrating his/her role. Since the inception of the cabinet system, the prime minister is known in Japanese as &quot;Naikaku Sōri-Daijin&quot; (内閣総理大臣) whenever he is referred to as the head of the Cabinet. However, this title is usually abbreviated to &quot;Sōri-Daijin&quot; (総理大臣). Other abbreviations include &quot;Sōri&quot; (総理), &quot;Shushō&quot; (首相) or even &quot;Saishō&quot; (宰相).

=== English notation ===
The official English rendering is &#x27;Prime Minister&#x27;. This English translation was informally used as the English translation of &#x27;Grand Minister&#x27; before the introduction of the cabinet system. However, this was not the original English translation of &#x27;Prime Minister&#x27;, and a German translation, &#x27;Minister President of the State&#x27;, was also used in the past.

== History ==

Before the adoption of the Meiji Constitution, Japan had in practice no written constitution. Originally, a Chinese-inspired legal system known as &quot;ritsuryō&quot; was enacted in the late Asuka period and early Nara period. It described a government based on an elaborate and rational meritocratic bureaucracy, serving, in theory, under the ultimate authority of the emperor; although in practice, real power was often held elsewhere, such as in the hands of the Fujiwara clan, who intermarried with the imperial family in the Heian period, or by the ruling &quot;shōgun&quot;. Theoretically, the last &quot;ritsuryō&quot; code, the Yōrō Code enacted in 752, was still in force at the time of the Meiji Restoration.

Under this system, the was the head of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; (Department of State), the highest organ of Japan&#x27;s pre-modern Imperial government during the Heian period and until briefly under the Meiji Constitution with the appointment of Sanjō Sanetomi in 1871. The office was replaced in 1885 with the appointment of Itō Hirobumi to the new position of Minister President of State, four years before the enactment of the Meiji Constitution, which mentions neither the Cabinet nor the position of Prime Minister explicitly. It took its current form with the adoption of the Constitution of Japan in 1947.

To date, sixty-five men have served this position. The longest-serving prime minister to date is Shinzo Abe, who served in two non-consecutive terms for 8 years, 267 days: from 26 September 2006 until 26 September 2007, and from 26 December 2012 until 16 September 2020. The shortest-serving prime minister to date is Prince Naruhiko Higashikuni, who served for fifty-four days: from 17 August until 9 October 1945.

==Appointment==
The prime minister is nominated by both houses of the Diet, before the conduct of any other business. For that purpose, each conducts a ballot under the run-off system. If the two houses choose different individuals, then a joint committee of both houses is appointed to agree on a common nominee. Ultimately, however, if the two houses do not agree, the decision of the House of Representatives is deemed to be that of the Diet. If the House of Councillors does not make a nomination within 10 days of the House of Representatives&#x27; nomination, the House of Representatives&#x27; nomination becomes the Diet&#x27;s decision. Therefore, the House of Representatives can theoretically ensure the appointment of any prime minister it wants. The nominee is then presented with his or her commission, and formally appointed to office by the emperor at the Tokyo Imperial Palace.

Conventionally, the prime minister is almost always the leader of the majority party in the House of Representatives, or the leader of the senior partner in the governing coalition. But there have been three cabinet prime ministers from junior coalition partners (Hitoshi Ashida: 1948, Morihiro Hosokawa: 1993 and Tomiichi Murayama: 1994), a few minority governments (most recently the Hata Cabinet in 1994 and at least numerically the Second Hashimoto Cabinet of 1996 during its first year, but with an extra-cabinet cooperation (閣外協力, &quot;kakugai kyōryoku&quot;) agreement with two parties, sufficient to ensure safe majorities for most government initiatives), and several cabinets with a majority in the House of Representatives, but without legislative majority of their own (most recently the DPJ-led cabinets, Kan and Noda Cabinets after the 2010 upper house election; cf. &quot;Nejire Kokkai&quot;/&quot;twisted Diets&quot;).

==Qualifications==
* Must be a member of either house of the Diet. (This implies a minimum age of 25 and a Japanese nationality requirement.)
* Must be a civilian. This excludes serving members of the Japan Self-Defense Forces. Former military persons may be appointed, with Yasuhiro Nakasone being one prominent example.

==Role==

===Constitutional roles===
* Exercises &quot;control and supervision&quot; over the entire executive branch.
* Presents bills to the Diet on behalf of the Cabinet.
* Signs laws and Cabinet orders (along with other members of the Cabinet).
* Appoints all Cabinet ministers, and can dismiss them at any time.
* May permit legal action to be taken against Cabinet ministers.
* Must make reports on domestic and foreign relations to the Diet.
* Must report to the Diet upon demand to provide answers or explanations.
* May advise the emperor to dissolve the House of Representatives.

===Statutory roles===
* Presides over meetings of the Cabinet.
* Commander-in-chief of the Japan Self-Defense Forces.
* May override a court injunction against an administrative act upon showing of cause.

Unlike most of his counterparts in constitutional monarchies, the prime minister is both &quot;de jure&quot; and &quot;de facto&quot; chief executive. In most other constitutional monarchies, the monarch is at least nominal chief executive, while being bound by convention to act on the advice of the cabinet. In contrast, the Constitution of Japan explicitly vests executive power in the Cabinet, of which the prime minister is the leader; this greatly enhances the prime minister&#x27;s position compared to prime ministers in other parliamentary democracies. His countersignature is required for all laws and Cabinet orders. While most ministers in parliamentary democracies have some freedom of action within the bounds of cabinet collective responsibility, the Japanese Cabinet is effectively an extension of the prime minister&#x27;s authority.

==Insignia==
==Official office and residence==

Located near the Diet building, the Office of the Prime Minister of Japan is called the . The original Kantei served from 1929 until 2002, when a new building was inaugurated to serve as the current Kantei. The old Kantei was then converted into the Official Residence, or . The Kōtei lies to the southwest of the Kantei, and is linked by a walkway.

== Travel ==
The prime minister of Japan travels in a Toyota Century. The Lexus LS 600h L, which served as the prime minister&#x27;s official car from 2008 to 2019, became a spare/alternative vehicle used by the Prime Minister till present. 

For overseas air travel, the Japanese government maintains two Boeing 777, which replaced the Boeing 747-400 also in 2019. The aircraft is also used by the emperor, the members of the imperial family, and other high-ranking officials.

They have the radio callsigns Japanese Air Force One and Japanese Air Force Two when operating on official business, and Cygnus One and Cygnus Two when operating outside of official business (e.g., on training flights). The aircraft always fly together on government missions, with one serving as the primary transport and the other serving as a backup with maintenance personnel on board. The aircraft are officially referred to as .

==Retirement honours and emoluments==

Until the mid-1930s, the prime minister of Japan was normally granted a hereditary peerage (&quot;kazoku&quot;) prior to leaving office if he had not already been ennobled. Titles were usually bestowed in the ranks of count, viscount or baron, depending on the relative accomplishments and status of the prime minister. The two highest ranks, marquess and prince, were only bestowed upon highly distinguished statesmen, and were not granted to a prime minister after 1928. The last prime minister who was a peer was Baron Kijūrō Shidehara, who served as Prime Minister from October 1945 to May 1946. The peerage was abolished when the Constitution of Japan came into effect in May 1947.

Certain eminent prime ministers have been awarded the Order of the Chrysanthemum, typically in the degree of Grand Cordon. The highest honour in the Japanese honours system, the Collar of the Order of the Chrysanthemum, has only been conferred upon select prime ministers and eminent statesmen; the last such award to a living prime minister was to Saionji Kinmochi in 1928. More often, the Order of the Chrysanthemum has been a posthumous distinction; both the Collar and Grand Cordon of the order were last awarded posthumously to former prime minister Shinzo Abe in July 2022.

After relinquishing office, the prime minister is normally accorded the second or senior third rank in the court order of precedence, and is usually raised to the senior second rank posthumously. Certain distinguished prime ministers have been posthumously raised to the first rank; the last such award was to Eisaku Sato in 1975. Since the 1920s, following their tenure in office, Prime ministers have typically been conferred with the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Paulownia Flowers (until 2003 a special higher class of the Order of the Rising Sun), depending on tenure and eminence. However, honours may be withheld due to misconduct or refusal on the part of the prime minister (for example, Kiichi Miyazawa).

The Prime Minister also awards individuals in recognition of their accomplishments in sport, entertainment, and other fields. Some of the awards and commendations offered include the Prime Minister&#x27;s Award, created by Eisaku Satō in 1966, and the People&#x27;s Honour Award, created by Takeo Fukuda in 1977. Additionally, the PM also presents the Prime Minister&#x27;s Trophy on behalf of the Japan Professional Sports Association and the Monodzukuri Nippon award on behalf of the Japanese Manufacturing Association.

<doc id="24834" wikidata="Q658882" url="?curid=24834" title="Protein targeting">
<text>Protein targeting or protein sorting is the biological mechanism by which proteins are transported to their appropriate destinations within or outside the cell. Proteins can be targeted to the inner space of an organelle, different intracellular membranes, the plasma membrane, or to the exterior of the cell via secretion. Information contained in the protein itself directs this delivery process. Correct sorting is crucial for the cell; errors or dysfunction in sorting have been linked to multiple diseases.

== History ==

In 1970, Günter Blobel conducted experiments on protein translocation across membranes. Blobel, then an assistant professor at Rockefeller University, built upon the work of his colleague George Palade. Palade had previously demonstrated that non-secreted proteins were translated by free ribosomes in the cytosol, while secreted proteins (and target proteins, in general) were translated by ribosomes bound to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Candidate explanations at the time postulated a processing difference between free and ER-bound ribosomes, but Blobel hypothesized that protein targeting relied on characteristics inherent to the proteins, rather than a difference in ribosomes. Supporting his hypothesis, Blobel discovered that many proteins have a short amino acid sequence at one end that functions like a postal code specifying an intracellular or extracellular destination. He described these short sequences (generally 13 to 36 amino acids residues) as signal peptides or signal sequences and was awarded the 1999 Nobel prize in Physiology for the same.

== Signal peptides ==

Signal peptides serve as targeting signals, enabling cellular transport machinery to direct proteins to specific intracellular or extracellular locations. While no consensus sequence has been identified for signal peptides, many nonetheless possess a characteristic tripartite structure:

# A positively charged, hydrophilic region near the N-terminal.
# A span of 10 to 15 hydrophobic amino acids near the middle of the signal peptide.
# A slightly polar region near the C-terminal, typically favoring amino acids with smaller side chains at positions approaching the cleavage site.

After a protein has reached its destination, the signal peptide is generally cleaved by a signal peptidase. Consequently, most mature proteins do not contain signal peptides. While most signal peptides are found at the N-terminal, in peroxisomes the targeting sequence is located on the C-terminal extension. Unlike signal peptides, signal patches are composed by amino acid residues that are discontinuous in the primary sequence but become functional when folding brings them together on the protein surface. Unlike most signal sequences, signal patches are not cleaved after sorting is complete. In addition to intrinsic signaling sequences, protein modifications like glycosylation can also induce targeting to specific intracellular or extracellular regions.

==Protein translocation==
Since the translation of mRNA into protein by a ribosome takes place within the cytosol, proteins destined for secretion or a specific organelle must be translocated. This process can occur during translation, known as co-translational translocation, or after translation is complete, known as post-translational translocation.

=== Co-translational translocation ===

Most secretory and membrane-bound proteins are co-translationally translocated. Proteins that reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), golgi or endosomes also use the co-translational translocation pathway. This process begins while the protein is being synthesized on the ribosome, when a signal recognition particle (SRP) recognizes an N-terminal signal peptide of the nascent protein. Binding of the SRP temporarily pauses synthesis while the ribosome-protein complex is transferred to an SRP receptor on the ER in eukaryotes, and the plasma membrane in prokaryotes. There, the nascent protein is inserted into the translocon, a membrane-bound protein conducting channel composed of the Sec61 translocation complex in eukaryotes, and the homologous SecYEG complex in prokaryotes. In secretory proteins and type I transmembrane proteins, the signal sequence is immediately cleaved from the nascent polypeptide once it has been translocated into the membrane of the ER (eukaryotes) or plasma membrane (prokaryotes) by signal peptidase. The signal sequence of type II membrane proteins and some polytopic membrane proteins are not cleaved off and therefore are referred to as signal anchor sequences. Within the ER, the protein is first covered by a chaperone protein to protect it from the high concentration of other proteins in the ER, giving it time to fold correctly. Once folded, the protein is modified as needed (for example, by glycosylation), then transported to the Golgi for further processing and goes to its target organelles or is retained in the ER by various ER retention mechanisms.

The amino acid chain of transmembrane proteins, which often are transmembrane receptors, passes through a membrane one or several times. These proteins are inserted into the membrane by translocation, until the process is interrupted by a stop-transfer sequence, also called a membrane anchor or signal-anchor sequence. These complex membrane proteins are currently characterized using the same model of targeting that has been developed for secretory proteins. However, many complex multi-transmembrane proteins contain structural aspects that do not fit this model. Seven transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (which represent about 5% of the genes in humans) mostly do not have an amino-terminal signal sequence. In contrast to secretory proteins, the first transmembrane domain acts as the first signal sequence, which targets them to the ER membrane. This also results in the translocation of the amino terminus of the protein into the ER membrane lumen. This translocation, which has been demonstrated with opsin with in vitro experiments, breaks the usual pattern of &quot;co-translational&quot; translocation which has always held for mammalian proteins targeted to the ER. A great deal of the mechanics of transmembrane topology and folding remains to be elucidated.

===Post-translational translocation===
Even though most secretory proteins are co-translationally translocated, some are translated in the cytosol and later transported to the ER/plasma membrane by a post-translational system. In prokaryotes this process requires certain cofactors such as SecA and SecB and is facilitated by Sec62 and Sec63, two membrane-bound proteins. The Sec63 complex, which is embedded in the ER membrane, causes hydrolysis of ATP, allowing chaperone proteins to bind to an exposed peptide chain and slide the polypeptide into the ER lumen. Once in the lumen the polypeptide chain can be folded properly. This process only occurs in unfolded proteins located in the cytosol.

In addition, proteins targeted to other cellular destinations, such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, or peroxisomes, use specialized post-translational pathways. Proteins targeted for the nucleus are also translocated post-translationally through the addition of a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that promotes passage through the nuclear envelope via nuclear pores.

==Sorting of proteins==
=== Mitochondria ===
While some proteins in the mitochondria originate from mitochondrial DNA within the organelle, most mitochondrial proteins are synthesized as cytosolic precursors containing uptake peptide signals. Unfolded proteins bound by cytosolic chaperone hsp70 that are targeted to the mitochondria may be localized to four different areas depending on their sequences. They may be targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, the outer membrane, the intermembrane space, or the inner membrane. Defects in any one or more of these processes has been linked to health and disease.

==== Mitochondrial matrix ====
Proteins destined for the mitochondrial matrix have specific signal sequences at their beginning (N-terminus) that consist of a string of 20 to 50 amino acids. These sequences are designed to interact with receptors that guide the proteins to their correct location inside the mitochondria. The sequences have a unique structure with clusters of water-loving (hydrophilic) and water-avoiding (hydrophobic) amino acids, giving them a dual nature known as amphipathic. These amphipathic sequences typically form a spiral shape (alpha-helix) with the charged amino acids on one side and the hydrophobic ones on the opposite side. This structural feature is essential for the sequence to function correctly in directing proteins to the matrix. If mutations occur that mess with this dual nature, the protein often fails to reach its intended destination, although not all changes to the sequence have this effect. This indicates the importance of the amphipathic property for the protein to be correctly targeted to the mitochondrial matrix.Proteins targeted to the mitochondrial matrix first involves interactions between the matrix targeting sequence located at the N-terminus and the outer membrane import receptor complex TOM20/22. In addition to the docking of internal sequences and cytosolic chaperones to TOM70. Where TOM is an abbreviation for translocase of the outer membrane. Binding of the matrix targeting sequence to the import receptor triggers a handoff of the polypeptide to the general import core (GIP) known as TOM40. The general import core (TOM40) then feeds the polypeptide chain through the intermembrane space and into another translocase complex TIM17/23/44 located on the inner mitochondrial membrane. This is accompanied by the necessary release of the cytosolic chaperones that maintain an unfolded state prior to entering the mitochondria. As the polypeptide enters the matrix, the signal sequence is cleaved by a processing peptidase and the remaining sequences are bound by mitochondrial chaperones to await proper folding and activity. The push and pull of the polypeptide from the cytosol to the intermembrane space and then the matrix is achieved by an electrochemical gradient that is established by the mitochondrion during oxidative phosphorylation. In which a mitochondrion active in metabolism has generated a negative potential inside the matrix and a positive potential in the intermembrane space. It is this negative potential inside the matrix that directs the positively charged regions of the targeting sequence into its desired location.

==== Mitochondrial inner membrane ====
Targeting of mitochondrial proteins to the inner membrane may follow 3 different pathways depending upon their overall sequences, however, entry from the outer membrane remains the same using the import receptor complex TOM20/22 and TOM40 general import core. The first pathway for proteins targeted to the inner membrane follows the same steps as those designated to the matrix where it contains a matrix targeting sequence that channels the polypeptide to the inner membrane complex containing the previously mentioned translocase complex TIM17/23/44. However, the difference is that the peptides that are designated to the inner membrane and not the matrix contain an upstream sequence called the stop-transfer-anchor sequence. This stop-transfer-anchor sequence is a hydrophobic region that embeds itself into the phospholipid bilayer of the inner membrane and prevents translocation further into the mitochondrion. The second pathway for proteins targeted to the inner membrane follows the matrix localization pathway in its entirety. However, instead of a stop-transfer-anchor sequence, it contains another sequence that interacts with an inner membrane protein called Oxa-1 once inside the matrix that will embed it into the inner membrane. The third pathway for mitochondrial proteins targeted to the inner membrane follow the same entry as the others into the outer membrane, however, this pathway utilizes the translocase complex TIM22/54 assisted by complex TIM9/10 in the intermembrane space to anchor the incoming peptide into the membrane. The peptides for this last pathway do not contain a matrix targeting sequence, but instead contain several internal targeting sequences.

==== Mitochondrial intermembrane space ====
If instead the precursor protein is designated to the intermembrane space of the mitochondrion, there are two pathways this may occur depending on the sequences being recognized. The first pathway to the intermembrane space follows the same steps for an inner membrane targeted protein. However, once bound to the inner membrane the C-terminus of the anchored protein is cleaved via a peptidase that liberates the preprotein into the intermembrane space so it can fold into its active state. One of the greatest examples for a protein that follows this pathway is cytochrome b2, that upon being cleaved will interact with a heme cofactor and become active. The second intermembrane space pathway does not utilize any inner membrane complexes and therefor does not contain a matrix targeting signal. Instead, it enters through the general import core TOM40 and is further modified in the intermembrane space to achieve its active conformation. TIM9/10 is an example of a protein that follows this pathway in order to be in the location it needs to be to assist in inner membrane targeting.

==== Mitochondrial outer membrane ====
Outer membrane targeting simply involves the interaction of precursor proteins with the outer membrane translocase complexes that embeds it into the membrane via internal-targeting sequences that are to form hydrophobic alpha helices or beta barrels that span the phospholipid bilayer. This may occur by two different routes depending on the preprotein internal sequences. If the preprotein contains internal hydrophobic regions capable of forming alpha helices, then the preprotein will utilize the mitochondrial import complex (MIM) and be transferred laterally to the membrane. For preproteins containing hydrophobic internal sequences that correlate to beta-barrel forming proteins, they will be imported from the aforementioned outer membrane complex TOM20/22 to the intermembrane space. In which they will interact with TIM9/10 intermembrane-space protein complex that transfers them to sorting and assembly machinery (SAM) that is present in the outer membrane that laterally displaces the targeted protein as a beta-barrel.

===Chloroplasts===
Chloroplasts are similar to mitochondria in that they contain their own DNA for production of some of their components. However, the majority of their proteins are obtained via post-translational translocation and arise from nuclear genes. Proteins may be targeted to several sites of the chloroplast depending on their sequences such as the outer envelope, inner envelope, stroma, thylakoid lumen, or the thylakoid membrane. Proteins are targeted to Thylakoids by mechanisms related to Bacterial Protein Translocation. Proteins targeted to the envelope of chloroplasts usually lack cleavable sorting sequence and are laterally displaced via membrane sorting complexes. General import for the majority of preproteins requires translocation from the cytosol through the Toc and Tic complexes located within the chloroplast envelope. Where Toc is an abbreviation for the translocase of the outer chloroplast envelope and Tic is the translocase of the inner chloroplast envelope. There is a minimum of three proteins that make up the function of the Toc complex. Two of which, referred to as Toc159 and Toc34, are responsible for the docking of stromal import sequences and both contain GTPase activity. The third known as Toc 75, is the actual translocation channel that feeds the recognized preprotein by Toc159/34 into the chloroplast.

==== Stroma ====
Targeting to the stroma requires the preprotein to have a stromal import sequence that is recognized by the Tic complex of the inner envelope upon being translocated from the outer envelope by the Toc complex. The Tic complex is composed of at least five different Tic proteins that are required to form the translocation channel across the inner envelope. Upon being delivered to the stroma, the stromal import sequence is cleaved off via a signal peptidase. This delivery process to the stroma is currently known to be driven by ATP hydrolysis via stromal HSP chaperones, instead of the transmembrane electrochemical gradient that is established in mitochondria to drive protein import. Further intra-chloroplast sorting depends on additional target sequences such as those designated to the thylakoid membrane or the thylakoid lumen.

==== Thylakoid lumen ====
If a protein is to be targeted to the thylakoid lumen, this may occur via four differently known routes that closely resemble bacterial protein transport mechanisms. The route that is taken depends upon the protein delivered to the stroma being in either an unfolded or metal-bound folded state. Both of which will still contain a thylakoid targeting sequence that is also cleaved upon entry to the lumen. While protein import into the stroma is ATP-driven, the pathway for metal-bound proteins in a folded state to the thylakoid lumen has been shown to be driven by a pH gradient.

==== Thylakoid membrane ====
Proteins bound for the membrane of the thylakoid will follow up to four known routes that are illustrated in the corresponding figure shown. They may follow a co-translational insertion route that utilizes stromal ribosomes and the SecY/E transmembrane complex, the SRP-dependent pathway, the spontaneous insertion pathway, or the GET pathway. The last of the three are post-translational pathways originating from nuclear genes and therefor constitute the majority of proteins targeted to the thylakoid membrane. According to recent review articles in the journal of biochemistry and molecular biology, the exact mechanisms are not yet fully understood.

=== Both chloroplasts and mitochondria ===
Many proteins are needed in both mitochondria and chloroplasts. In general the dual-targeting peptide is of intermediate character to the two specific ones. The targeting peptides of these proteins have a high content of basic and hydrophobic amino acids, a low content of negatively charged amino acids. They have a lower content of alanine and a higher content of leucine and phenylalanine. The dual targeted proteins have a more hydrophobic targeting peptide than both mitochondrial and chloroplastic ones. However, it is tedious to predict if a peptide is dual-targeted or not based on its physio-chemical characteristics.

=== Nucleus ===
The nucleus of a cell is surrounded by a nuclear envelope consisting of two layers, with the inner layer providing structural support and anchorage for chromosomes and the nuclear lamina. The outer layer is similar to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. This envelope contains nuclear pores, which are complex structures made from around 30 different proteins. These pores act as selective gates that control the flow of molecules into and out of the nucleus.

While small molecules can pass through these pores without issue, larger molecules, like RNA and proteins destined for the nucleus, must have specific signals to be allowed through. These signals are known as nuclear localization signals, usually comprising short sequences rich in positively charged amino acids like lysine or arginine. 

Proteins called nuclear import receptors recognize these signals and guide the large molecules through the nuclear pores by interacting with the disordered, mesh-like proteins that fill the pore. The process is dynamic, with the receptor moving the molecule through the meshwork until it reaches the nucleus.

Once inside, a GTPase enzyme called Ran, which can exist in two different forms (one bound to GTP and the other to GDP), facilitates the release of the cargo inside the nucleus and recycles the receptor back to the cytosol. The energy for this transport comes from the hydrolysis of GTP by Ran. Similarly, nuclear export receptors help move proteins and RNA out of the nucleus using a different signal and also harnessing Ran&#x27;s energy conversion.

Overall, the nuclear pore complex works efficiently to transport macromolecules at high speed, allowing proteins to move in their folded state and ribosomal components as complete particles, which is distinct from how proteins are transported into most other organelles.

=== Endoplasmic reticulum ===
The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) plays a key role in protein synthesis and distribution in eukaryotic cells. It&#x27;s a vast network of membranes where proteins are processed and sorted to various destinations, including the ER itself, the cell surface, and other organelles like the Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and lysosomes. Unlike other organelle-targeted proteins, those headed for the ER start to be transferred across its membrane while they&#x27;re still being made.

==== Protein synthesis and sorting ====
There are two types of proteins that move to the ER: water-soluble proteins, which completely cross into the ER lumen, and transmembrane proteins, which partly cross and embed themselves within the ER membrane. These proteins find their way to the ER with the help of an ER signal sequence, a short stretch of hydrophobic amino acids.

Proteins entering the ER are synthesized by ribosomes. There are two sets of ribosomes in the cell: those bound to the ER (making it look &#x27;rough&#x27;) and those floating freely in the cytosol. Both sets are identical but differ in the proteins they synthesize at a given moment. Ribosomes that are making proteins with an ER signal sequence attach to the ER membrane and start the translocation process. This process is energy-efficient because the growing protein chain itself pushes through the ER membrane as it elongates.

As the mRNA is translated into a protein, multiple ribosomes may attach to it, creating a structure called a polyribosome. If the mRNA is coding for a protein with an ER signal sequence, the polyribosome attaches to the ER membrane, and the protein begins to enter the ER while it is still being synthesized.

===== Guided entry of soluble proteins =====
In the process of protein synthesis within eukaryotic cells, soluble proteins that are destined for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or for secretion out of the cell are guided to the ER by a two-part system. Firstly, a signal-recognition particle (SRP) in the cytosol attaches to the emerging protein&#x27;s ER signal sequence and the ribosome itself. Secondly, an SRP receptor located in the ER membrane recognizes and binds to the SRP. This interaction temporarily slows down protein synthesis until the SRP and ribs complex binds to the SRP receptor on the ER.

Once this binding occurs, the SRP is released, and the ribosome is transferred to a protein translocator in the ER membrane, allowing protein synthesis to continue. The polypeptide chain of the protein is then threaded through a channel in the translocator into the ER lumen. The signal sequence of the protein, typically at the beginning (N-terminus) of the polypeptide chain, plays a dual role. It not only targets the ribosome to the ER but also triggers the opening of the translocator. As the protein is fed through the translocator, the signal sequence stays attached, allowing the rest of the protein to move through as a loop. A signal peptidase inside the ER then cuts off the signal sequence, which is subsequently discarded into the lipid bilayer of the ER membrane and broken down.

Finally, once the last part of the protein (the C-terminus) passes through the translocator, the entire soluble protein is released into the ER lumen, where it can then fold and undergo further modifications or be transported to its final destination.

====== Mechanisms of transmembrane protein integration ======
Transmembrane proteins, which are partly integrated into the ER membrane rather than released into the ER lumen, have a complex assembly process. The initial stages are similar to soluble proteins: a signal sequence starts the insertion into the ER membrane. However, this process is interrupted by a stop-transfer sequence—a string of hydrophobic amino acids—which causes the translocator to halt and release the protein laterally into the membrane. This results in a single-pass transmembrane protein with one end inside the ER lumen and the other in the cytosol, and this orientation is permanent.

Some transmembrane proteins use an internal signal (start-transfer sequence) instead of one at the N-terminus, and unlike the initial signal sequence, this start-transfer sequence isn&#x27;t removed. It begins the transfer process, which continues until a stop-transfer sequence is encountered, at which point both sequences become anchored in the membrane as alpha-helical segments.

In more complex proteins that span the membrane multiple times, additional pairs of start- and stop-transfer sequences are used to weave the protein into the membrane in a fashion akin to a sewing machine. Each pair allows a new segment to cross the membrane and adds to the protein&#x27;s structure, ensuring it is properly embedded with the correct arrangement of segments inside and outside the ER membrane.

===Peroxisomes===

Peroxisomes contain a single phospholipid bilayer that surrounds the peroxisomal matrix containing a wide variety of proteins and enzymes that participate in anabolism and catabolism. Peroxisomes are specialized cell organelles that carry out specific oxidative reactions using molecular oxygen. Their primary function is to remove hydrogen atoms from organic molecules, a process that results in the production of hydrogen peroxide (). Within peroxisomes, an enzyme called catalase plays a critical role. It uses the hydrogen peroxide generated in the earlier reaction to oxidize various other substances, including phenols, formic acid, formaldehyde, and alcohol. This is known as the &quot;peroxidative&quot; reaction.

Peroxisomes are particularly important in liver and kidney cells for detoxifying harmful substances that enter the bloodstream. For example, they are responsible for oxidizing about 25% of the ethanol we consume into acetaldehyde. Additionally, catalase within peroxisomes can break down excess hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen and thus preventing potential damage from the build-up of . Since it contains no internal DNA like that of the mitochondria or chloroplast all peroxisomal proteins are encoded by nuclear genes. To date there are two types of known Peroxisome Targeting Signals (PTS):

# Peroxisome targeting signal 1 (PTS1): a C-terminal tripeptide with a consensus sequence (S/A/C)-(K/R/H)-(L/A). The most common PTS1 is serine-lysine-leucine (SKL). The initial research that led to the discovery of this consensus observed that when firefly luciferase was expressed in cultured insect cells it was targeted to the peroxisome. By testing a variety of mutations in the gene encoding the expressed luciferase, the consensus sequence was then determined. It has also been found that by adding this C-terminal sequence of SKL to a cytosolic protein that it becomes targeted for transport to the peroxisome. The majority of peroxisomal matrix proteins possess this PTS1 type signal.
# Peroxisome targeting signal 2 (PTS2): a nonapeptide located near the N-terminus with a consensus sequence (R/K)-(L/V/I)-XXXXX-(H/Q)-(L/A/F) (where X can be any amino acid).

There are also proteins that possess neither of these signals. Their transport may be based on a so-called &quot;piggy-back&quot; mechanism: such proteins associate with PTS1-possessing matrix proteins and are translocated into the peroxisomal matrix together with them.

In the case of cytosolic proteins that are produced with the PTS1 C-terminal sequence, its path to the peroxisomal matrix is dependent upon binding to another cytosolic protein called pex5 (peroxin 5). Once bound, pex5 interacts with a peroxisomal membrane protein pex14 to form a complex. When the pex5 protein with bound cargo interacts with the pex14 membrane protein, the complex induces the release of the targeted protein into the matrix. Upon releasing the cargo protein into the matrix, pex5 dissociation from pex14 occurs via ubiquitinylation by a membrane complex comprising pex2, pex12, and pex10 followed by an ATP dependent removal involving the cytosolic protein complex pex1 and pex6. The cycle for pex5 mediated import into the peroxisomal matrix is restored after the ATP dependent removal of ubiquitin and is free to bind with another protein containing a PTS1 sequence. Proteins containing a PTS2 targeting sequence are mediated by a different cytosolic protein but are believed to follow a similar mechanism to that of those containing the PTS1 sequence.

==Diseases==
Protein transport is defective in the following genetic diseases:

* Mohr–Tranebjaerg syndrome
*Zellweger syndrome
*Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD).
*Refsum disease
*Parkinson&#x27;s disease
*Hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, obesity, and diabetes

==In bacteria and archaea==
As discussed above (see protein translocation), most prokaryotic membrane-bound and secretory proteins are targeted to the plasma membrane by either a co-translation pathway that uses bacterial SRP or a post-translation pathway that requires SecA and SecB. At the plasma membrane, these two pathways deliver proteins to the SecYEG translocon for translocation. Bacteria may have a single plasma membrane (Gram-positive bacteria), or an inner membrane plus an outer membrane separated by the periplasm (Gram-negative bacteria). Besides the plasma membrane the majority of prokaryotes lack membrane-bound organelles as found in eukaryotes, but they may assemble proteins onto various types of inclusions such as gas vesicles and storage granules.

===Gram-negative bacteria===

In gram-negative bacteria proteins may be incorporated into the plasma membrane, the outer membrane, the periplasm or secreted into the environment. Systems for secreting proteins across the bacterial outer membrane may be quite complex and play key roles in pathogenesis. These systems may be described as type I secretion, type II secretion, etc.

===Gram-positive bacteria===

In most gram-positive bacteria, certain proteins are targeted for export across the plasma membrane and subsequent covalent attachment to the bacterial cell wall. A specialized enzyme, sortase, cleaves the target protein at a characteristic recognition site near the protein C-terminus, such as an LPXTG motif (where X can be any amino acid), then transfers the protein onto the cell wall. Several analogous systems are found that likewise feature a signature motif on the extra-cytoplasmic face, a C-terminal transmembrane domain, and cluster of basic residues on the cytosolic face at the protein&#x27;s extreme C-terminus. The PEP-CTERM/exosortase system, found in many Gram-negative bacteria, seems to be related to extracellular polymeric substance production. The PGF-CTERM/archaeosortase A system in archaea is related to S-layer production. The GlyGly-CTERM/rhombosortase system, found in the Shewanella, Vibrio, and a few other genera, seems involved in the release of proteases, nucleases, and other enzymes.

<doc id="24837" wikidata="Q1898942" url="?curid=24837" title="Pinochle">
<text>Pinochle (), also called pinocle or penuchle, is a trick-taking ace–ten card game, typically for two to four players and played with a 48-card deck. It is derived from the card game bezique; players score points by trick-taking and also by forming combinations of characters into melds. It is thus considered part of a &quot;trick-and-meld&quot; category which also includes the game belote. Each hand is played in three phases: bidding, melds, and tricks. The standard game today is called &quot;partnership auction pinochle&quot;.

==History==
Pinochle is thought to have two possible origins. One is that it is a cousin of Binokel, with both games evolving from the game of bezique. A second alternative is that pinochle actually developed from the Swiss and, later, South German game of Binocle or Binokel, which in turn is a descendant of bezique. 

The word pinochle has several different potential derivations. It may come from the French word &quot;binocle&quot; literally meaning &quot;two eyes&quot;, or &quot;eyeglasses&quot; or &quot;binoculars&quot;, and was a reference to the mythical notion that the German game of Binocle was invented with a special deck where the Queen of Spades and Jack of Diamonds were pictured in side profile with just one eye each. There are also suggestions that the word pinochle comes from &quot;bis&quot; (until) and &quot;Knöchel&quot; (knuckle) because originally the game ended when a player rapped their knuckles on the table. The term may also be related to the French word &quot;binage&quot; for the combination of cards called &quot;binocle&quot;. This latter pronunciation of the game was adopted by German speakers. 

German immigrants brought the game of Binokel to America in the latter quarter of the 19th century, where it was mispronounced and misspelled &quot;pinochle.&quot; Pinochle was the favorite card game of American Jewish and Irish immigrants, while Skat was the preferred game of a majority of German immigrants. Auction Pinochle for three players has some similarities with the German game Skat, although the bidding is more similar to that of bid whist.

During World War I, the city of Syracuse, New York, outlawed the playing of pinochle in a gesture of anti-German sentiment. It was also temporarily banned in some other US cities as a result of its German heritage, but has since regained popularity.

==Deck==
A pinochle deck consists of two copies of each of the 9, 10, jack, queen, king, and ace cards of all four suits, for 48 cards per deck. Aces are always considered high. Pinochle follows a nonstandard card ordering. The complete ordering from highest to lowest is A, 10, K, Q, J, 9. The game can also be played using standard ranking with a simple change to scoring.

Originally, the deck had to be composed by combining two poker, piquet or euchre decks and removing unneeded cards (a piquet deck does not have the 2–6, making it easier to modify, and a euchre deck is exactly half a pinochle deck), but with the game&#x27;s popularity in the United States in the early 1900s, a single boxed deck with the necessary cards was marketed, and these specialized pinochle decks are now widely available in similar styles to common 52-card counterparts. Variants of pinochle can be played with five, six, eight or more players. These larger variations can combine two pinochle decks called a &quot;double deck&quot;. The double deck can also be used when playing with four players; hand sizes, average scores and minimum bids are doubled.

==Partnership auction pinochle==
===Dealing===
The game is played with a deck of 48 cards and four players; one player is the dealer.

After the shuffle, the dealer will offer a cut to the player on their right, then distribute the cards. All the cards are dealt in partnership pinochle. In variations for odd numbers of players like three, a &quot;widow&#x27;s hand&quot; (also called a &quot;kitty&quot;, &quot;talon&quot;, or &quot;stock&quot;) of cards remains. Traditionally, the deal is done clockwise, dealing a packet of three or four cards at a time, starting with the player to the left (the eldest hand) and ending with the dealer. The deal rotates clockwise, so the dealer&#x27;s left-hand opponent will deal next.

Some versions include a rule that a player being dealt five nines constitutes a misdeal, and the cards must be redealt. A variation of this stipulates that if someone is dealt five nines, they must also have no aces to constitute a misdeal, or if one has six nines and up to one ace.

===Auction pinochle===
In auction pinochle, players bid for the points they predict their hand could earn. The highest bidder earns the right to declare the trump suit. One of the players, usually the player to the left of the dealer, or the dealer themselves, is obligated to open with a first bid. The size of bids is based on the point scale and number of decks used; traditionally, points are in multiples of 10, thus a minimum opening bid might be agreed to be 100 or 250. However, many alternate scoring rules drop the unnecessary trailing zero; in that case, bids of 10 and 25, respectively, have the same values. When a player has the turn to bid, the player may either bid or pass.

A popular variation for four (or three) player pinochle involves dealing a 4 card kitty (3 or 6 cards for three players), with the bid winner taking the kitty and discarding 4 (3 or 6) cards from his hand. The point value of the discards can sometimes be added to the bid winner&#x27;s total trick count or not, depending on the pre-established rules. In three player games the 6 card kitty can often lead to very competitive and extravagant bidding.

Each bid must be greater than the previous one, and be a multiple of 10 or 25 (if playing without trailing zeroes, the bid must be one or two greater respectively). When a player passes, they can no longer bid. The auction ends when all subsequent players in rotation have passed after the last bid. The last bid becomes the &quot;contract&quot;. The player that made this final bid will then declare trump in the suit that is desired. In some house rules, trump cannot be declared in any suit not containing a &quot;run&quot;, &quot;marriage&quot; or &quot;dix&quot; meld.

In order for the winning bidder to win the hand, the combined total of melding and trick points must be equal to or greater than the winning bid. Thus bidding involves anticipating the points that will be accumulated from melds and from the points accumulated from winning tricks. If the combined score is lower than the bid, then the bidding team or player has been &quot;set&quot;. This means that the total bid amount is subtracted from the total game score, often accompanied by losing the points scored in meld for that hand as well. This can result in a negative score.

A related though different style of bidding is for the players to bid individually, and partners&#x27; bids are then summed. The winning bid only decides trump; both (or all) teams&#x27; bids become their contract, meaning any team can score or be set. This creates a more balanced game.

===Passing cards===
In some versions of pinochle, after the bid has been taken and trump declared in a partnership game, the bid winning team exchanges cards. It may be two, three, or four cards, depending on the version of the game. The partner of the bid winner passes first. The objective of the partner is either to add to the total points in meld or to pass trick-winning cards. After receiving the cards, the bid winner examines what will create the strongest hand and then discards an equal number of cards back to their partner. Variations are for the bid winner and partner to exchange the designated number of cards simultaneously, or for no passing to occur.

===Melding===
Melding consists of displaying specific combinations of cards to all players. Typically this is done by placing the combination of cards face up on the playing surface until all players have had the opportunity to examine them. All players meld after the bid winner shows meld first. The types of melds include &quot;arounds&quot;, &quot;marriages&quot;, &quot;flushes&quot; and &quot;pinochles&quot;. These melds are placed under &quot;headings&quot; where a card which is melded under a particular heading can be used again under another heading, but cannot be melded again under the same heading.

The group melds containing four of the same face cards – ace, king, queen or jack – must include one card from each of the different suits. They are scored as follows:

* &quot;100 aces&quot; or &quot;aces around&quot; – four aces of different suits – 100 or 10 points
* &quot;80 kings&quot; or &quot;kings around&quot; – four kings of different suits – 80 or 8 points
* &quot;60 queens&quot; or &quot;queens around&quot; – four queens of different suits – 60 or 6 points
* &quot;40 jacks&quot; or &quot;jacks around&quot; – four jacks of different suits – 40 or 4 points
* &quot;1000 aces&quot; or &quot;aces abound&quot; – all eight aces – 1000 or 100 points
* &quot;800 kings&quot; or &quot;kings abound&quot; – all eight kings – 800 or 80 points
* &quot;600 queens&quot; or &quot;queens abound&quot; – all eight queens – 600 or 60 points
* &quot;400 jacks&quot; or &quot;jacks abound&quot; – all eight jacks – 400 or 40 points

The marriages and flush are the &quot;sequence melds&quot;:

* &quot;Trump marriage&quot; – king and queen of trump suit – 40 or 4 points, 80 or 8 for double. In some variations, a double marriage in trump is worth 400 or 40 points.
* &quot;Marriage&quot; – king and queen of a (same) suit other than trump – 20 or 2 points, 40 or 4 for double
* &quot;Flush&quot;, &quot;family&quot;, &quot;rope&quot;, &quot;book&quot;, &quot;straight&quot;, or &quot;run&quot; – A, 10, K, Q, and J of trump suit only – 150 or 15 points. Similar to the arounds, a double run – or two runs in trump in the same hand – is worth 1500 points or 150 points.

A marriage in each suit is worth 240 or 24 total points, which is nothing more than the sum of the marriages, plus kings around and queens around. As a shortcut, this is called a &quot;roundtable&quot;, &quot;marriages around&quot;, &quot;round house&quot;, or a &quot;round robin&quot;.

The pinochle and dix are the &quot;special melds&quot;.
* &quot;Pinochle&quot; – jack of diamonds and queen of spades – 40 or 4 points
* &quot;Double pinochle&quot; – both jacks of diamonds and both queens of spades – 300 or 30 points
* &quot;Dix&quot; – (pronounced &quot;deece&quot; ) nine of trumps – 10 or 1 points each

In the most common form of the game (see variations below), any one card may be used in only one meld of each type. Thus, a queen can be used in one marriage with one king, regardless whether the player has the other king of the same suit. However, a queen can be used to score a marriage and a pinochle if the player also has the correct jack.

After the melds are displayed, the points are counted and each player totals their individual meld scores.

Because all of these values are multiples of ten, one can arrive at simplified values by removing the trailing zero from each point total. For instance, a pinochle has a simplified score of 4, a double Pinochle would score 30.

===Playing tricks===
In playing cards for tricks, there are strict rules of forced play, which limit a player&#x27;s ability to strategically retain high cards. The high bidder leads the play with the first card, which can be any card in the contract winner&#x27;s hand just like basic Whist, although some rules require the first card led to be a trump card. Then there are two variations of following suit depending if you are playing post-1945 or pre-1945 rules.

According to the pre-1945 rules, every player must follow the lead suit if possible. Usually every player must play a winning card against those played so far, if it is possible to do so, even when the current player expects a later player to win the hand with a better card. The only exception is if a player played a trump card when trump was not the suit led. In that case, those following that player may play any card of the lead suit, since they must follow the lead suit but are already losing to the player who played trump. Likewise, if a player cannot follow suit, but has trump, they must play trump. Again, if a player does not have any cards of the lead suit and can play a trump card higher than any other trump played so far, the player must do so, even if the player expects that a later player will beat the card. If another trump has already been played that a player cannot beat, then they can play any trump in their hand, but they still must play a trump card if they can. Only when a player has no cards in suit, and has no trump, can the player choose to play any card in their hand.

Most books of post-1945 rules say that unless trump is led, there is no requirement to try to win the trick. It is only when trump is led that &quot;heading&quot; the trick is mandatory. In pinochle circles and tournaments the post-1945 rules are played about half of the time according to Pagat and Hoyle.

If two identical cards are played, the first one outranks the second.

After the first trick, the winner of each trick leads the first card for the next trick, until all the cards are played.

===Scoring tricks===
Points are scored based on the tricks won in the hand. There are several ways to count up the points for play, but they always add up to 250 points. The last trick is always worth an additional 10 points added to any existing points in the actual trick cards. The classic counting system of pinochle is where aces are worth 11, tens are worth 10, kings are worth four, queens are worth three, jacks are worth two, and nines are worth zero. This method takes longer to count the score at the end of each hand.

A simpler method is to count aces and tens for 10 points, kings and queens for five points, and jacks and nines are worth zero.

An even simpler method has aces, tens, and kings worth 10 (and known as &quot;counters&quot;), and everything else zero (&quot;garbage&quot;). Since all points are multiples of ten in the third method, most players drop the redundant zero. Aces, tens, and kings won in tricks are worth one point. The meld scoring can also avoid the zero in the tenth place. Melds like 1,000 aces are thus worth 100. The terms &quot;1,000 aces&quot;, &quot;800 kings&quot; and so on are often used, even though the point values are one-tenth.

==Game variations==
===Two-handed===
Two-handed pinochle is the original pinochle game, while partnership, auction, and all other variants are derived from it. It is the game most similar to the original Bezique game, whence pinochle was derived, via the German game of Binokel. The only significant difference in its rules from Bezique is the scoring.

The original version of pinochle involves a partial deal of twelve cards to both players in packets of four, leaving a stock of 24 cards. A player can score one meld after each trick won of the first 12 tricks. Melded cards can even be used to win tricks. After each trick, players draw one card from the stock into their hand starting with the trick-winning player. For the last 12 tricks, melds are taken into each player&#x27;s hand and are no longer announced by the player who wins the trick. The traditional trick-taking rules apply only for these last 12 tricks.

In variations of two-handed play, no cards are initially dealt, a distinction from all other variations. Instead, the entire deck is placed face-down on the playing surface between the two players to form the widow. One player begins the hand-building process by drawing the top card of the widow. The player can either keep that card for her or his hand or reject the card. If the player chooses to hold the initial card, the player then draws a second card from the widow, then places it face-down, without looking at it, creating a discard pile. If the player rejects the first card, the card becomes the first card in the discard pile. The second card drawn from the widow must be kept, regardless of whether she or he preferred the first card. Players alternate turns in this hand-building process until all cards are chosen.

With bidding, the player winning the bid declares trump, then lays all meld face-up on the table. The other player shows her or his melds as well. Meld points are tallied, and players return meld cards to their hands. Some varieties accept a &quot;round house&quot;, kings and queens of each suit, and earn a bonus 10 points awarding a total of 250 points.

Trick-taking commences and continues until all held cards have been played. One variation has no &quot;leading&quot; requirement for the bid winner or subsequent trick winner to lead a specific card, however the rules of &quot;following&quot; are still observed.

When adding counters, cards from each player&#x27;s discard pile are included in totals for a total of 240 counters per round, plus one counter for winning the final trick. One variation to make it more difficult for the bid-winning player, the discard pile created by drawing cards is used by the non-bidding player to score towards tricks.

===Three-handed===
In Three-handed pinochle using a single deck, each player plays for him or herself. The dealer deals 15 cards to each player and three cards to the kitty—a separate pile in the middle.

All players review their cards and silently determine their bids. The player to the dealer&#x27;s left initiates the bidding process. If the player has a meld, he or she is required to open the bidding; otherwise, they may pass or bid. If he or she passes, the obligation to bid passes to the next player, if meld is held. Once a player passes, he or she is out of the auction.

Bidding begins at 20, or as little as 19 if dealer, and increases in multiples of 1. The highest bidder wins the auction and turns up the three-card kitty for all to see. The three widow cards are placed in the bid winner&#x27;s hand. The bid winner then declares trump and lays down meld. The other two players also lay meld face-up for count. After the appropriate points have been tallied the bid winner must set aside any three cards that have not been melded. This will reduce the bid winner&#x27;s hand to 15 cards. For all three players, meld is now returned to each respective player&#x27;s hand, and the round is played. During the round, a player must take at least one trick to &quot;save one&#x27;s meld&quot;, even if the trick contains no points; otherwise, no meld points will be counted for that player during that round.

After all tricks are taken, counters are tallied for each player. The three discards by the highest bidder count toward their counter score for the hand, so there is always a total of 25 points for the trick score among the three players. If the highest bidder fails to make their contract by adding meld points and trick points from the play, then their score is negative the amount of the bid for that hand. The meld count is cancelled.

* After viewing the kitty, the highest bidder may concede the hand and take a negative score for the amount of their bid; however, they still must name trump and the other two players score their meld. Conceding the hand does save the trick points opponents would score playing their hands, although opponents will not have an opportunity to lose their meld by failing to take a trick.

The game is won when one player reaches 100 points. It is possible for two or all three players to go over 100 on the same hand. There are three methods of resolving ties:

* Playing another hand 
* The game is extended becomes a contest to 125 points. If two players exceed 125 points on the same hand, the contest lengthens to 150 points. This rule holds regardless of score fluctuations (players &quot;going minus&quot;—failing to reach their bid amounts—and falling below 100 points.
* If two players exceed 100 points on the same hand, then the high bidder for that round automatically is declared the winner. If two non-bidders exceed 100 points on the same hand, then either of the other methods apply.

===Renege===
Any time a player accidentally misplays during the play portion of the hand, it is called a renege. There are various forms of misplay:

* Playing out of suit
* Sloughing on a trick when holding trump 
* Playing out of turn
* Failure to discard three cards prior to the play portion of the hand—this constitutes a renege if bidder has led to the first trick
* Purposely exposing any portion of your hand to another player (during the play portion of the game for all players and also during the meld portion of the hand for nonbidders with the exception of meld cards)
* Failure to kill (Not going over the played card when required to during the hand)
* Any other action that disrupts the harmony of the game
* After play begins, any discovered misdeal not caused by a card-fault in the deck constitutes a renege for the dealer and any player on the dealer&#x27;s team.

If the bidder reneges, they automatically take a double set and the amount of the bid is subtracted from their score. The two opposing players get to count their meld points and the remainder of the hand is thrown in.

If either of the two nonbidders misplay, the bidder automatically makes their bid. The bidder gets to score the amount of their bid and meld, the player that misplayed loses all meld and takes a single set, and the third player scores only their meld.

If at any point during melding or play it is determined that a non-standard deck is being used, any player may declare a card-fault misdeal. This results in the nullification of the entire hand including all meld and points obtained.

===Cutthroat===
Similar to three-handed pinochle, cutthroat is a simple modification. The dealer deals the entire deck out (16 cards to each player), in packets of four. The player to the left of the dealer begins the bidding once meld has been silently determined by all players. Play continues normally in terms of scoring and trick taking. The only way to win in cutthroat pinochle, however, is to &quot;bid and out&quot;, or to have taken the bid and surpassed the predetermined winning score. It is then possible for multiple players to go over the winning score, yet if none has taken a bid and met the resulting contract, a win has not happened and play continues. It is also possible for a person to lose with the high score if they do not take a winning bid.

===Four-handed===
Four-handed pinochle, or &quot;partnership pinochle&quot; is played with two teams of two players each. Partners are seated opposite from each other. Each player is dealt 12 cards. The opening bid is typically 150, but can be a higher agreed on value. All four players may bid. Both the bidder and his partner have their score count towards making the contract. High bidder names trump. There typically is no kitty. With a kitty, the four cards are distributed, one to each player, by the bid winner. Each hand must meld separately. As in the three-handed version, the first player is forced to bid when holding meld. Play is often to 1000 but can increase to 1500 during partnership.

===Five-handed and larger===
Games with five hands or more typically modify partnership pinochle in a variety of ways. They are generally played with 1 1/2 or doubled decks, with extra dix added or withheld to make an even deal. With an odd number of players, the bidder asks for a desired card in the trump suit, with the first matching player being partner for that hand. Everyone else plays against the team. In larger groups, one or more players can sit out each hand allowing the remaining players to follow the appropriate rules for the respective number of players.

===Check===
Check pinochle is a gambling variant of three-hand. It is the same as to 1000, except that players keep track of &quot;checks&quot;. If playing for $1 stakes, each check gained means that the other two players owe a dollar. The following events cause a gain or loss of checks.

* Flush or run +1 check
* Aces +1 check
* Roundtable +2 checks (marriage in each suit)
: Note that checks for meld can be earned either by the bidder or non-bidder. Checks are kept even if the bid is not made.
* Looking at the &quot;talon&quot; and losing the hand (either by conceding or playing) −1 check
* Playing the hand and losing −1 additional check 
* Not looking at the talon and conceding 300 points. – no gain or loss of checks (happens when forced to bid)
* Double marriage (two marriages in same suit) +1 check 
* Double pinochle +1 check 
* Double aces, double kings, double queens, or double jacks +2 checks 
* Winning the game +5 or +10 checks
* 7 nines +5 or +10 checks (do not need to win the bid to get credit)

===Double-deck===
Today &quot;double-deck&quot; pinochle is a popular form of the game, exclusively played by the National Pinochle Association, the American Pinochle Association, the Cambridge Pinochle Association, and in the &quot;World Series of Pinochle&quot;.

Double-deck pinochle is played with two pinochle decks, without the nines. This makes for an 80 card deck.

Play is similar to regular pinochle, except 20 cards are dealt to each person and minimum bid is increased to 500 points. In some variations, bids are made in increments of 10 or more points until 600 is reached, then by 50 points. This version often features &quot;meld bidding&quot;, a bid made to let a partner know what is in the bidder&#x27;s hand. The only communication during bidding should be a numerical number or &quot;pass&quot;, any other way of communicating is called &quot;talking across the table&quot; and is forbidden.

There are occasionally different meld values for a run and a pinochle; a run being 250 or 150 points, and a pinochle being 150 or 40 points. All other aspects of the game generally remain the same.

Technical Misdeal

If a player is dealt 13 or more non-counters and no aces, the player may declare a technical misdeal. This must declared before he or she plays the first trick. A technical misdeal nullifies all points melded for all players. The hand is then re-dealt by the original dealer of that hand.

===Triple-deck, six-handed===
This version follows the rules of double-deck pinochle.

In triple-deck pinochle six play in two partnerships of three each; each player has an opponent at their right and left. Three pinochle decks with no nines are mixed together, making a pack of 120 cards. Each player is dealt 20 cards, and the rules of double deck pinochle apply, except that the minimum bid is 75, and the last trick is worth 3 points. most of the extra melds made possible by the triple pack do not count extra. i.e. if a player should hold twenty aces, five of each suit, the value would be that of double aces and triple aces combined.

===Internet===
Internet pinochle is almost always &quot;double deck&quot; except for a few applications for some smart phones. Today the Internet is host to many live professional cash tournaments, although many are still cautious about playing online because of potential cheating.

===Racehorse===
Note that this use of the term &quot;racehorse&quot; is inconsistent with the commonly understood meaning of the term when applied to Pinochle. As summarized by Dave LeVasseur: &quot;Racehorse means that, after the winning bidder has named trump, that player&#x27;s partner passes cards across the table&quot;

Played much the same as &quot;double deck&quot; but to six hands, the point values are inflated.

Two teams are formed, 20 cards are then dealt to each player and four cards are dealt to the blind. Bidding commences with the person immediately to the left of the dealer automatically bidding 500. The winner of the bid includes the blind into their hand, calls trump and melds.

Note: all runs, double, triple, and quadruple, marriages must be in trump

The game continues with the standard rules of play. When the play is over each team adds up their points in the count with kings, 10s, and aces worth ten points, while queens and jacks are worth zero. If a team count plus meld does not equal their bid, they &quot;go set&quot;. By going set the amount of the bid is subtracted from the team&#x27;s score and their count is discarded. The other team retains both their meld and their count provided they took at least 10 points in the count.

===Eight-player double-deck===
Two full decks are dealt between eight players, forming four teams. Team members are spaced so that they are not able to see any other hands. The game is usually played to a score of 5,000 or higher. Other than this, the four-player rules apply, and any variations may also be used. There is an increased possibility that when one team declares trump another team may have an equal number of trump also, which may lead to an interesting game. An optional scoring rule rewards 1,000 points for a quadruple pinochle—four jacks of diamonds and four queens of spades in a meld.

===Alternate end games===
One variation on winning allows a team or individual to win instantly from any score by taking all the tricks in a hand. To win in this fashion, the winning player or team must play very skillfully to prevent opposing players from taking even one lowly (even zero-point) trick. This victory is known as &quot;pinochling&quot;. A player or team can play for this victory even if they are not the highest bidder. &quot;pinochling&quot; does not require a bidder to make their bid. They also can play for this victory even if their bid cannot be made with the maximum number of trick points available plus their meld. However, the highest bidding player or team can prevent other players from attempting this if they elect to &quot;throw in&quot; the hand before the first card is played.

Another version of this, known as &quot;shooting the moon,&quot; can be called out by the highest bidder before melding. In this variation, neither team lays their meld down, and the partner of the high bidder does not participate in trick taking. If the high bidder succeeds in taking every trick, they have successfully &quot;shot the moon,&quot; and the game is over. If they do not successfully take every trick, this is known as a &quot;miss,&quot; and the shooting team immediately loses the game. Yet another variation has a point value of 1000 or 100 for shooting the moon, and an equal negative penalty for missing, and the game continues.

When playing &quot;bid-out&quot; rules, a team can win without bidding if their score reaches (and remains above) the agreed-upon game-ending score while their opponents fail to make their bid three times. This is known as a &quot;slide-out&quot;. Not all versions require the opponents to fail to make their bid three times in order to cross the winning point threshold. 

Some versions have an &quot;out backwards&quot; contingency, where if a team goes into the negative equivalent of what the game winning score is, they lose the game.

<doc id="24838" wikidata="Q206920" url="?curid=24838" title="Peptidoglycan">
<text>Peptidoglycan or murein is a unique large macromolecule, a polysaccharide, consisting of sugars and amino acids that forms a mesh-like layer (sacculus) that surrounds the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. The sugar component consists of alternating residues of β-(1,4) linked &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and &quot;N&quot;-acetylmuramic acid (NAM). Attached to the &quot;N&quot;-acetylmuramic acid is an oligopeptide chain made of three to five amino acids. The peptide chain can be cross-linked to the peptide chain of another strand forming the 3D mesh-like layer. Peptidoglycan serves a structural role in the bacterial cell wall, giving structural strength, as well as counteracting the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm. This repetitive linking results in a dense peptidoglycan layer which is critical for maintaining cell form and withstanding high osmotic pressures, and it is regularly replaced by peptidoglycan production. Peptidoglycan hydrolysis and synthesis are two processes that must occur in order for cells to grow and multiply, a technique carried out in three stages: clipping of current material, insertion of new material, and re-crosslinking of existing material to new material.

The peptidoglycan layer is substantially thicker in gram-positive bacteria (20 to 80 nanometers) than in gram-negative bacteria (7 to 8 nanometers). Depending on pH growth conditions, the peptidoglycan forms around 40 to 90% of the cell wall&#x27;s dry weight of gram-positive bacteria but only around 10% of gram-negative strains. Thus, presence of high levels of peptidoglycan is the primary determinant of the characterisation of bacteria as gram-positive. In gram-positive strains, it is important in attachment roles and serotyping purposes. For both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, particles of approximately 2 nm can pass through the peptidoglycan.

It is difficult to tell whether an organism is gram-positive or gram-negative using a microscope; Gram staining, created by Hans Christian Gram in 1884, is required. The bacteria are stained with the dyes crystal violet and safranin. Gram positive cells are purple after staining, while Gram negative cells stain pink.

== Structure ==

The peptidoglycan layer within the bacterial cell wall is a crystal lattice structure formed from linear chains of two alternating amino sugars, namely &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc or NAG) and &quot;N&quot;-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc or NAM). The alternating sugars are connected by a β-(1,4)-glycosidic bond. Each MurNAc is attached to a short (4- to 5-residue) amino acid chain, containing -alanine, -glutamic acid, &quot;meso&quot;-diaminopimelic acid, and -alanine in the case of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; (a gram-negative bacterium); or -alanine, -glutamine, -lysine, and -alanine with a 5-glycine interbridge between tetrapeptides in the case of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; (a gram-positive bacterium). Peptidoglycan is one of the most important sources of -amino acids in nature.

By enclosing the inner membrane, the peptidoglycan layer protects the cell from lysis caused by the turgor pressure of the cell. When the cell wall grows, it retains its shape throughout its life, so a rod shape will remain a rod shape, and a spherical shape will remain a spherical shape for life. This happens because the freshly added septal material of synthesis transforms into a hemispherical wall for the offspring cells.

Cross-linking between amino acids in different linear amino sugar chains occurs with the help of the enzyme -transpeptidase and results in a 3-dimensional structure that is strong and rigid. The specific amino acid sequence and molecular structure vary with the bacterial species.

The different peptidoglycan types of bacterial cell walls and their taxonomic implications have been described. Archaea (domain &quot;Archaea&quot;) do not contain peptidoglycan (murein). Some Archaea contain pseudopeptidoglycan (pseudomurein, see below).

Peptidoglycan is involved in binary fission during bacterial cell reproduction. L-form bacteria and mycoplasmas, both lacking peptidoglycan cell walls, do not proliferate by binary fission, but by a budding mechanism.

In the course of early evolution, the successive development of boundaries (membranes, walls) protecting first structures of life against their environment must have been essential for the formation of the first cells (cellularisation).

The invention of rigid peptidoglycan (murein) cell walls in bacteria (domain &quot;Bacteria&quot;) was probably the prerequisite for their survival, extensive radiation and colonisation of virtually all habitats of the geosphere and hydrosphere.

== Biosynthesis ==
The peptidoglycan monomers are synthesized in the cytosol and are then attached to a membrane carrier bactoprenol. Bactoprenol transports peptidoglycan monomers across the cell membrane where they are inserted into the existing peptidoglycan.

# In the first step of peptidoglycan synthesis, glutamine, which is an amino acid, donates an amino group to a sugar, fructose 6-phosphate. This reaction, catalyzed by EC 2.6.1.16 (GlmS), turns fructose 6-phosphate into glucosamine-6-phosphate.
# In step two, an acetyl group is transferred from acetyl CoA to the amino group on the glucosamine-6-phosphate creating &quot;N&quot;-acetyl-glucosamine-6-phosphate. This reaction is EC 5.4.2.10, catalyzed by GlmM.
# In step three of the synthesis process, the &quot;N&quot;-acetyl-glucosamine-6-phosphate is isomerized, which will change &quot;N&quot;-acetyl-glucosamine-6-phosphate to &quot;N&quot;-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate. This is EC 2.3.1.157, catalyzed by GlmU.
# In step 4, the &quot;N&quot;-acetyl-glucosamine-1-phosphate, which is now a monophosphate, attacks UTP. Uridine triphosphate, which is a pyrimidine nucleotide, has the ability to act as an energy source. In this particular reaction, after the monophosphate has attacked the UTP, an inorganic pyrophosphate is given off and is replaced by the monophosphate, creating UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (2,4). (When UDP is used as an energy source, it gives off an inorganic phosphate.) This initial stage, is used to create the precursor for the NAG in peptidoglycan. This is EC 2.7.7.23, also catalyzed by GlmU, which is a bifunctional enzyme.
# In step 5, some of the UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) is converted to UDP-MurNAc (UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid) by the addition of a lactyl group to the glucosamine. Also in this reaction, the C3 hydroxyl group will remove a phosphate from the alpha carbon of phosphoenolpyruvate. This creates what is called an enol derivative. EC 2.5.1.7, catalyzed by MurA.
# In step 6, the enol is reduced to a &quot;lactyl moiety&quot; by NADPH in step six. EC 1.3.1.98, catalyzed by MurB.
# In step 7, the UDP–MurNAc is converted to UDP-MurNAc pentapeptide by the addition of five amino acids, usually including the dipeptide -alanyl--alanine. This is a string of three reactions: EC 6.3.2.8 by MurC, EC 6.3.2.9 by MurD, and EC 6.3.2.13 by MurE.

Each of these reactions requires the energy source ATP. This is all referred to as Stage one.

Stage two occurs in the cytoplasmic membrane. It is in the membrane where a lipid carrier called bactoprenol carries peptidoglycan precursors through the cell membrane.
# Undecaprenyl phosphate will attack the UDP-MurNAc penta, creating a PP-MurNac penta, which is now a lipid (lipid I). EC 2.7.8.13 by MraY.
# UDP-GlcNAc is then transported to MurNAc, creating Lipid-PP-MurNAc penta-GlcNAc (lipid II), a disaccharide, also a precursor to peptidoglycan. EC 2.4.1.227 by MurG.
# Lipid II is transported across the membrane by flippase (MurJ), a discovery made in 2014 after decades of searching. Once it is there, it is added to the growing glycan chain by the enzyme peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase (GTase, EC 2.4.1.129). This reaction is known as transglycosylation. In the reaction, the hydroxyl group of the GlcNAc will attach to the MurNAc in the glycan, which will displace the lipid-PP from the glycan chain.
# In a final step, the -transpeptidase (TPase, EC 3.4.16.4) crosslinks individual glycan chains. This protein is also known as the penicillin-binding protein. Some versions of the enzyme also performs the glycosyltransferase function, while others leave the job to a separate enzyme.
== Pseudopeptidoglycan ==

In some archaea, i.e. members of the Methanobacteriales and in the genus &quot;Methanopyrus&quot;, pseudopeptidoglycan (pseudomurein) has been found. In pseudopeptidoglycan the sugar residues are β-(1,3) linked &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine and &quot;N&quot;-acetyltalosaminuronic acid. This makes the cell walls of such archaea insensitive to lysozyme. The biosynthesis of pseudopeptidoglycan has been described.

== Recognition by immune system ==
Peptidoglycan recognition is an evolutionarily conserved process. The overall structure is similar between bacterial species, but various modifications can increase the diversity. These include modifications of the length of sugar polymers, modifications in the sugar structures, variations in cross-linking or substitutions of amino acids (primarily at the third position). The aim of these modifications is to alter the properties of the cell wall, which plays a vital role in pathogenesis.

Peptidoglycans can be degraded by several enzymes (lysozyme, glucosaminidase, endopeptidase...), producing immunostimulatory fragments (sometimes called muropeptides) that are critical for mediating host-pathogen interactions. These include MDP (muramyl dipeptide), NAG (N-acetylglucosamine) or iE-DAP (γ-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid).

Peptidoglycan from intestinal bacteria (both pathogens and commensals) crosses the intestinal barrier even under physiological conditions. Mechanisms through which peptidoglycan or its fragments enter the host cells can be direct (carrier-independent) or indirect (carrier-dependent), and they are either bacteria-mediated (secretion systems, membrane vesicles) or host cell-mediated (receptor-mediated, peptide transporters). Bacterial secretion systems are protein complexes used for the delivery of virulence factors across the bacterial cell envelope to the exterior environment. Intracellular bacterial pathogens invade eukaryotic cells (which may lead to the formation of phagolysosomes and/or autophagy activation), or bacteria may be engulfed by phagocytes (macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils...). The bacteria-containing phagosome may then fuse with endosomes and lysosomes, leading to degradation of bacteria and generation of polymeric peptidoglycan fragments and muropeptides.

=== Receptors ===
Innate immune system senses intact peptidoglycan and peptidoglycan fragments using numerous PRRs (pattern recognition receptors) that are secreted, expressed intracellularly or expressed on the cell surface.

==== Peptidoglycan recognition proteins ====
PGLYRPs are conserved from insects to mammals. Mammals produce four secreted soluble peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGLYRP-1, PGLYRP-2, PGLYRP-3 and PGLYRP-4) that recognize muramyl pentapeptide or tetrapeptide. They can also bind to LPS and other molecules by using binding sites outside of the peptidoglycan-binding groove. After recognition of peptidoglycan, PGLYRPs activate polyphenol oxidase (PPO) molecules, Toll, or immune deficiency (IMD) signalling pathways. That leads to production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).

Each of the mammalian PGLYRPs display unique tissue expression patterns. PGLYRP-1 is mainly expressed in the granules of neutrophils and eosinophils. PGLYRP-3 and 4 are expressed by several tissues such as skin, sweat glands, eyes or the intestinal tract. PGLYRP-1, 3 and 4 form disulphide-linked homodimers and heterodimers essential for their bactericidal activity. Their binding to bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans can induce bacterial cell death by interaction with various bacterial transcriptional regulatory proteins. PGLYRPs are likely to assist in bacterial killing by cooperating with other PRRs to enhance recognition of bacteria by phagocytes.

PGLYRP-2 is primarily expressed by the liver and secreted into the circulation. Also, its expression can be induced in skin keratinocytes, oral and intestinal epithelial cells. In contrast with the other PGLYRPs, PGLYRP-2 has no direct bactericidal activity. It possesses peptidoglycan amidase activity, it hydrolyses the lactyl-amide bond between the MurNAc and the first amino acid of the stem peptide of peptidoglycan. It is proposed, that the function of PGLYRP-2 is to prevent over-activation of the immune system and inflammation-induced tissue damage in response to NOD2 ligands (see below), as these muropeptides can no longer be recognized by NOD2 upon separation of the peptide component from MurNAc. Growing evidence suggests that peptidoglycan recognition protein family members play a dominant role in the tolerance of intestinal epithelial cells toward the commensal microbiota. It has been demonstrated that expression of PGLYRP-2 and 4 can influence the composition of the intestinal microbiota.

Recently, it has been discovered, that PGLYRPs (and also NOD-like receptors and peptidoglycan transporters) are highly expressed in the developing mouse brain. PGLYRP-2 and is highly expressed in neurons of several brain regions including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, thus indicating potential direct effects of peptidoglycan on neurons. PGLYRP-2 is highly expressed also in the cerebral cortex of young children, but not in most adult cortical tissues. PGLYRP-1 is also expressed in the brain and continues to be expressed into adulthood.

==== NOD-like receptors ====
Probably the most well-known receptors of peptidoglycan are the NOD-like receptors (NLRs), mainly NOD1 and NOD2. The NOD1 receptor is activated after iE-DAP (γ-d-glutamyl-meso-diaminopimelic acid) binding, while NOD2 recognizes MDP (muramyl dipeptide), by their LRR domains. Activation leads to self-oligomerization, resulting in activation of two signalling cascades. One triggers activation of NF-κB (through RIP2, TAK1 and IKK), second leads to MAPK signalling cascade. Activation of these pathways induces production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines.

NOD1 is expressed by diverse cell types, including myeloid phagocytes, epithelial cells and neurons. NOD2 is expressed in monocytes and macrophages, epithelial intestinal cells, Paneth cells, dendritic cells, osteoblasts, keratinocytes and other epithelial cell types. As cytosolic sensors, NOD1 and NOD2 must either detect bacteria that enter the cytosol, or peptidoglycan must be degraded to generate fragments that must be transported into the cytosol for these sensors to function.

Recently, it was demonstrated that NLRP3 is activated by peptidoglycan, through a mechanism that is independent of NOD1 and NOD2. In macrophages, N-acetylglucosamine generated by peptidoglycan degradation was found to inhibit hexokinase activity and induce its release from the mitochondrial membrane. It promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation through a mechanism triggered by increased mitochondrial membrane permeability.

NLRP1 is also considered as a cytoplasmic sensor of peptidoglycan. It can sense MDP and promote IL-1 secretion through binding NOD2.

==== C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) ====
C-type lectins are a diverse superfamily of mainly Ca2+-dependent proteins that bind a variety of carbohydrates (including the glycan skeleton of peptidoglycan), and function as innate immune receptors. CLR proteins that bind to peptidoglycan include MBL (mannose binding lectin), ficolins, Reg3A (regeneration gene family protein 3A) and PTCLec1. In mammals, they initiate the lectin-pathway of the complement cascade.

==== Toll-like receptors ====
The role of TLRs in direct recognition of peptidoglycan is controversial. In some studies, has been reported that peptidoglycan is sensed by TLR2. But this TLR2-inducing activity could be due to cell wall lipoproteins and lipoteichoic acids that commonly co-purify with peptidoglycan. Also variation in peptidoglycan structure in bacteria from species to species may contribute to the differing results on this topic.

Peptidoglycan is immunologically active, which can stimulate immune cells to increase the expression of cytokines and enhance antibody-dependent specific response when combined with vaccine or as adjuvant alone. MDP, which is the basic unit of peptidoglycan, was initially used as the active component of Freund&#x27;s adjuvant. Peptidoglycan from &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; was used as a vaccine to protect mice, showing that after vaccine injection for 40 weeks, the mice survived from &quot;S. aureus&quot; challenge at an increased lethal dose.

== Inhibition and degradation ==
Some antibacterial drugs such as penicillin interfere with the production of peptidoglycan by binding to bacterial enzymes known as penicillin-binding proteins or -transpeptidases. Penicillin-binding proteins form the bonds between oligopeptide crosslinks in peptidoglycan. For a bacterial cell to reproduce through binary fission, more than a million peptidoglycan subunits (NAM-NAG+oligopeptide) must be attached to existing subunits. Mutations in genes coding for transpeptidases that lead to reduced interactions with an antibiotic are a significant source of emerging antibiotic resistance. Since peptidoglycan is also lacking in L-form bacteria and in mycoplasmas, both are resistant against penicillin.

Other steps of peptidoglycan synthesis can also be targeted. The topical antibiotic bacitracin targets the utilization of C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphate. Lantibiotics, which includes the food preservative nisin, attack lipid II.

Lysozyme, which is found in tears and constitutes part of the body&#x27;s innate immune system exerts its antibacterial effect by breaking the β-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds in peptidoglycan (see above). Lysozyme is more effective in acting against gram-positive bacteria, in which the peptidoglycan cell wall is exposed, than against gram-negative bacteria, which have an outer layer of LPS covering the peptidoglycan layer. Several bacterial peptidoglycan modifications can result in resistance to degradation by lysozyme. Susceptibility of bacteria to degradation is also considerably affected by exposure to antibiotics. Exposed bacteria synthesize peptidoglycan that contains shorter sugar chains that are poorly crosslinked and this peptidoglycan is then more easily degraded by lysozyme.

<doc id="24845" wikidata="Q163514" url="?curid=24845" title="Pope Sixtus IV">
<text>Pope Sixtus IV (or Xystus IV, ; born Francesco della Rovere; 21 July 1414 – 12 August 1484) was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 9 August 1471 until his death. His accomplishments as pope included the construction of the Sistine Chapel and the creation of the Vatican Library. A patron of the arts, he brought together the group of artists who ushered the early Renaissance into Rome with the first masterpieces of the city&#x27;s new artistic age.

Sixtus founded the Spanish Inquisition through the bull &quot;Exigit sincerae devotionis affectus&quot; (1478), and he annulled the decrees of the Council of Constance. He was noted for his nepotism and was personally involved in the infamous Pazzi conspiracy, a plot to remove the Medici family from power in Florence.

==Early life==
Francesco was a member of Della Rovere family, a son of Leonardo Beltramo di Savona della Rovere and first wife Luchina Monteleoni. He was born in Celle Ligure, a town near Savona.

As a young man, Della Rovere joined the Franciscan Order, an unlikely choice for a political career, and his intellectual qualities were revealed while he was studying philosophy and theology at the University of Pavia. He went on to lecture at Padua and many other Italian universities.

In 1464, Della Rovere was elected Minister General of the Franciscan order at the age of 50. In 1467, he was appointed Cardinal by Pope Paul II with the titular church being the Basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli.

Before his papal election, Cardinal della Rovere was renowned for his unworldliness and had written learned treatises, including &quot;On the Blood of Christ&quot; and &quot;On the Power of God&quot;.

His reputation for piety was one of the deciding factors that prompted the College of Cardinals to elect him Pope upon the unexpected death of Paul II at the age of fifty-four.

==Papacy==

Upon being elected Pope, Della Rovere adopted the name Sixtus, which had not been used since the 5th century. One of his first acts was to declare a renewed crusade against the Ottoman Turks in Smyrna. However, after the conquest of Smyrna, the fleet disbanded. Some fruitless attempts were made towards unification with the Greek Church. For the remainder of his pontificate, Sixtus turned to temporal issues and dynastic considerations.

===Nepotism===
Sixtus IV sought to strengthen his position by surrounding himself with relatives and friends. In the fresco by Melozzo da Forlì, he is accompanied by his Della Rovere and Riario nephews, not all of whom were made cardinals; the protonotary apostolic Pietro Riario (on his right), the future Pope Julius II/ Giuliano Della Rovere standing before him; and Girolamo Riario and Giovanni della Rovere, behind the kneeling Platina, author of the first humanist history of the popes.

His nephew, Pietro Riario, possibly also benefited from his alleged nepotism. He was successively promoted to be a cardinal, the bishop of Florence, the Patriarch of Constantinople and given some 45 additional benefices. Pietro became one of the richest men in Rome and was entrusted with Pope Sixtus IV&#x27;s foreign policy, in addition to being given an unofficial post as the de facto ruler of Rome. He reportedly spent 200,000 gold ducats on foodstuffs and festivities during two years in office. Pietro died prematurely in 1474. Chroniclers of his life seem to regard his death as unnatural and thus connect his alleged grandiose spending habits and the impression they left on his contemporaries as causal.

Criticisms of Pietro&#x27;s meteoric rise were not constrained to the charge of benefiting from nepotism as Sixtus IV&#x27;s nephew, nor to allegations of possibly having been Sixtus IV&#x27;s illegitimate son. Indeed, Pietro and his brother Girolamo Riario were alleged to have been lovers of Sixtus IV in polemics against the latter. According to the later published chronicle of the Italian historian Stefano Infessura, &quot;Diary of the City of Rome&quot;, Sixtus was a &quot;lover of boys and a sodomite&quot; () awarding benefices and bishoprics in return for sexual favours and nominating a number of young men as cardinals. Sexualised polemics, in truth concerned with politics and not the sexual lives of their victims, were not uncommon during this time; but as Pfisterer (sic) notes &quot;the novel flood of accusations of sodomy against a pope&quot; and &quot;true flood of corresponding lampoons, reviling poems, and fictional epitaphs&quot; following his death are at the very least evidence for his contemporaries&#x27; opinions about the promotions of these young men.

The secular fortunes of the Della Rovere family began when Sixtus invested his nephew Giovanni with the lordship of Senigallia and arranged his marriage to the daughter of Federico III da Montefeltro, duke of Urbino; from that union came a line of Della Rovere dukes of Urbino that lasted until the line expired, in 1631. Six of the thirty-four cardinals that he created were his nephews.

In his territorial aggrandizement of the Papal States, his niece&#x27;s son, Cardinal Raffaele Riario (for whom the Palazzo della Cancelleria was constructed) was suspected of colluding in the failed Pazzi conspiracy of 1478 to assassinate both Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici and his brother Giuliano and replace them in Florence with Sixtus IV&#x27;s other nephew, Girolamo Riario. Francesco Salviati, Archbishop of Pisa and a main organizer of the plot, was hanged on the walls of the Florentine Palazzo della Signoria. Sixtus IV replied with an interdict and two years of war with Florence.

However, Infessura had partisan allegiances to the Colonna and so is not considered to be always reliable or impartial. The English churchman and Protestant polemicist John Bale, writing a century later, attributed to Sixtus &quot;the authorisation to practice sodomy during periods of warm weather&quot; to the &quot;Cardinal of Santa Lucia&quot;. This prompted the noted historian of the Catholic Church, Ludwig von Pastor, to issue a firm rebuttal.

===Foreign policy===
Sixtus continued a dispute with King Louis XI of France, who upheld the Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges (1438), which held that papal decrees needed royal assent before they could be promulgated in France. That was a cornerstone of the privileges claimed for the Gallican Church and could never be shifted as long as Louis XI manoeuvred to replace King Ferdinand I of Naples with a French prince. Louis was thus in conflict with the papacy, and Sixtus could not permit it.

On 1 November 1478, Sixtus published the papal bull &quot;Exigit Sincerae Devotionis Affectus&quot; through which the Spanish Inquisition was established in the Kingdom of Castile. Sixtus consented under political pressure from Ferdinand of Aragon, who threatened to withhold military support from his kingdom of Sicily. Nevertheless, Sixtus IV quarrelled over protocol and prerogatives of jurisdiction; he was unhappy with the excesses of the Inquisition and condemned the most flagrant abuses in 1482.

As a temporal prince who constructed stout fortresses in the Papal States, he encouraged the Venetians to attack Ferrara, which he wished to obtain for another nephew. Ercole I d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara, was allied with the Sforzas of Milan, the Medicis of Florence along with the King of Naples, normally a hereditary ally and champion of the papacy. The angered Italian princes allied to force Sixtus IV to make peace to his great annoyance.

For refusing to desist from the very hostilities that he himself had instigated and for being a dangerous rival to Della Rovere dynastic ambitions in the Marche, Sixtus placed Venice under interdict in 1483. He also lined the coffers of the state by unscrupulously selling high offices and privileges.

In ecclesiastical affairs, Sixtus promoted the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, which had been confirmed at the Council of Basle in 1439, and he designated 8 December as its feastday. In 1476, he issued the apostolic constitution &quot;Cum Praeexcelsa&quot;, establishing a Mass and Office for the feast. He formally annulled the decrees of the Council of Constance in 1478.

===Slavery===
The two papal bulls issued by Pope Nicholas V, &quot;Dum Diversas&quot; of 1452 and &quot;Romanus Pontifex&quot; of 1455, had effectively given the Portuguese the rights to acquire non-Christian slaves along the African Coast by force or trade. Those concessions were confirmed by Sixtus in his own bull, &quot;Aeterni regis&quot;, of 21 June 1481. Arguably the &quot;ideology of conquest&quot; expounded in those texts became the means by which commerce and conversion were facilitated.

In November 1476, Isabel and Fernando ordered an investigation into rights of conquest in the Canary Islands, and in the spring of 1478, they sent Juan Rejon with sixty soldiers and thirty cavalry to the Grand Canary, where the natives retreated inland. Sixtus&#x27;s earlier threats to excommunicate all captains or pirates who enslaved Christians in the bull &quot;Regimini Gregis&quot; of 1476 could have been intended to emphasise the need to convert the natives of the Canary Islands and Guinea and establish a clear difference in status between those who had converted and those who resisted. The ecclesiastical penalties were directed towards those who were enslaving the recent converts.

===Princely patronage===

As a civic patron in Rome, even the anti-papal chronicler Stefano Infessura agreed that Sixtus should be admired. The dedicatory inscription in the fresco by Melozzo da Forlì in the Vatican Palace records: &quot;You gave your city temples, streets, squares, fortifications, bridges and restored the Acqua Vergine as far as the Trevi...&quot;

In addition to restoring the aqueduct that provided Rome an alternative to the river water, which had made the city famously unhealthy, he restored or rebuilt over 30 of Rome&#x27;s dilapidated churches such as San Vitale (1475) and Santa Maria del Popolo, and he added seven new ones. The Sistine Chapel was sponsored by Sixtus IV, as was the &quot;Ponte Sisto&quot;, the Sistine Bridge (the first new bridge across the Tiber since Antiquity), and the building of &quot;Via Sistina&quot; (later named &quot;Borgo Sant&#x27;Angelo&quot;), a road leading from Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo to Saint Peter.

All of that was done to facilitate the integration of the Vatican Hill and Borgo with the heart of Old Rome. That was part of a broader scheme of urbanization carried out under Sixtus IV, who swept the long-established markets from the Campidoglio in 1477 and decreed in a bull of 1480 the widening of streets and the first post-Roman paving, the removal of porticoes and other post-classical impediments to free public passage.

At the beginning of his papacy, in 1471, Sixtus had donated several historically important Roman sculptures that founded a papal collection of art, which would eventually develop into the collections of the Capitoline Museums. He also refounded, enriched and enlarged the Vatican Library. He had Regiomontanus attempt the first sanctioned reorganisation of the Julian calendar and increased the size and prestige of the papal chapel choir, bringing singers and some prominent composers (Gaspar van Weerbeke, Marbrianus de Orto and Bertrandus Vaqueras) to Rome from the north.

In addition to being a patron of the arts, Sixtus was a patron of the sciences. Before he became pope, he had spent time at the very liberal and cosmopolitan University of Padua, which maintained considerable independence from the Church and had a very international character.

As Pope, he issued a papal bull allowing local bishops to give the bodies of executed criminals and unidentified corpses to physicians and artists for dissection. It was that access to corpses which allowed the anatomist Vesalius, along with Titian&#x27;s pupil Jan Stephen van Calcar, to complete the revolutionary medical/anatomical text &quot;De humani corporis fabrica&quot;.

===Other activities===
====Consistories====

The Pope created 34 cardinals in eight consistories held during his reign, among them three nephews, one grandnephew and one other relative, thus continuing the practice of nepotism that he and his successors would engage in during this period.

====Canonizations and beatifications====
Sixtus IV named seven new saints, with the most notable being Bonaventure (1482); he also beatified one person, John Buoni (1483).

====Uppsala University====
In 1477, Sixtus IV issued a papal bull authorizing the creation of Uppsala University – the first university in Sweden and in the whole of Scandinavia. The choice of this location for the university derived from the fact that the archbishopric of Uppsala had been one of the most important sees in Sweden proper since Christianity first spread to this region in the ninth century, as well as Uppsala being long-standing hub for regional trade. Uppsala&#x27;s bull, which granted the university its corporate rights, established a number of provisions. Among the most important of these was that the university was officially given the same freedoms and privileges as the University of Bologna. This included the right to establish the four traditional faculties of theology, law (Canon Law and Roman law), medicine, and philosophy, and to award the bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, licentiate, and doctoral degrees. The archbishop of Uppsala was also named as the university&#x27;s Chancellor, and was charged with maintaining the rights and privileges of the university and its members. This act of Sixtus IV had a profound long-term effect on the society and culture of Sweden, an effect which continues up to the present.

==Death==
Sixtus IV became ill on 8 August 1484; this illness worsened on 10 August while the pope was attending an event in Rome. He felt unwell that evening and was forced to cancel a meeting he was to hold with his cardinals the following morning. The Pope grew weaker during the night of 11 August and he was unable to sleep. Sixtus IV died the following evening – 12 August.

The envoy of the Medici family summed up Sixtus&#x27; reign in the announcement to his master, &quot;Today at 5 o&#x27;clock His Holiness Sixtus IV departed this life – may God forgive him!&quot;

Pope Sixtus&#x27;s tomb was destroyed in the Sack of Rome in 1527. Today, his remains, along with the remains of his nephew Pope Julius II (Giuliano della Rovere), are interred in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, in the floor in front of the monument to Pope Clement X. A marble tombstone marks the site.

His bronze funerary monument, now in the basement Treasury of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, made like a giant casket of goldsmith&#x27;s work, is by Antonio del Pollaiuolo; it was completed by 1493. The top of the casket is a lifelike depiction of the Pope lying in state. Around the sides are bas-relief panels depicting allegorical female figures representing Grammar, Rhetoric, Arithmetic, Geometry, Music, Painting, Astronomy, Philosophy, and Theology—the classical liberal arts, with the addition of painting and theology. Each figure incorporates the oak tree (&quot;rovere&quot; in Italian), symbol of Sixtus IV. The overall program of the panels, their beauty, complex symbolism, classical references and their relative arrangement are compelling and comprehensive illustrations of the Renaissance worldview. None of them actually states how he died.

==Cardinals==
Sixtus created an unusually large number of cardinals during his pontificate (23) who were drawn from the roster of the princely houses of Italy, France and Spain, thus ensuring that many of his policies continued after his death:
* Giuliano della Rovere (later Pope Julius II)
* Stefano Nardini
* Pedro González de Mendoza
* Giovanni Battista Cybo (later Pope Innocent VIII)
* Giovanni Arcimboldi
* Philibert Hugonet

<doc id="24849" wikidata="Q7350" url="?curid=24849" title="Panama Canal">
<text>The Panama Canal () is an artificial waterway in Panama that connects the Caribbean Sea with the Pacific Ocean. It cuts across the narrowest point of the Isthmus of Panama, and is a conduit for maritime trade between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Locks at each end lift ships up to Gatun Lake, an artificial fresh water lake above sea level, created by damming the Chagres River and Lake Alajuela to reduce the amount of excavation work required for the canal. Locks then lower the ships at the other end. An average of of fresh water is used in a single passing of a ship. The canal is threatened by low water levels during droughts.

The Panama Canal shortcut greatly reduces the time for ships to travel between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, enabling them to avoid the lengthy, hazardous route around the southernmost tip of South America via the Drake Passage, the Strait of Magellan or the Beagle Channel. Its construction was one of the largest and most difficult engineering projects ever undertaken. Since its inauguration on August 15, 1914, the canal has succeeded in shortening maritime communication in time and distance, invigorating maritime and economic transportation by providing a short and relatively inexpensive transit route between the two oceans, decisively influencing global trade patterns, boosting economic growth in developed and developing countries, as well as providing the basic impetus for economic expansion in many remote regions of the world.

Colombia, France, and later the United States controlled the territory surrounding the canal during construction. France began work on the canal in 1881, but stopped in 1889 because of a lack of investors&#x27; confidence due to engineering problems and a high worker mortality rate. The US took over the project in 1904 and opened the canal in 1914. The US continued to control the canal and surrounding Panama Canal Zone until the Torrijos–Carter Treaties provided for its handover to Panama in 1977. After a period of joint American–Panamanian control, the Panamanian government took control in 1999. It is now managed and operated by the Panamanian government-owned Panama Canal Authority.

The original locks are wide and allow the passage of Panamax ships. A third, wider lane of locks was constructed between September 2007 and May 2016. The expanded waterway began commercial operation on 26 June 2016. The new locks allow for the transit of larger, Neopanamax ships.

Annual traffic has risen from about 1,000 ships in 1914, when the canal opened, to 14,702 vessels in 2008, for a total of 333.7 million Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) tons. By 2012, more than 815,000 vessels had passed through the canal; in that year, the United States, China, Chile, Japan, and South Korea were the top five users of the canal. In 2017, it took ships an average of 11.38 hours to pass between the canal&#x27;s two outer locks. The American Society of Civil Engineers has ranked the Panama Canal one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World.

==History==
===Early proposals in Panama===

The idea of the Panama Canal dates back to 1513, when the Spanish conquistador Vasco Núñez de Balboa first crossed the Isthmus of Panama. He wrote in his journal the possibility of a canal but did not take action. Instead, the first trans-isthmian route was established to carry the plunder of Peru to Spain from Panama to Nombre de Dios. European powers soon noticed the possibility to dig a water passage between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans across this narrow land bridge between North and South America. The earliest proposal dates to 1534, when the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V ordered a survey for a route through the Americas in order to ease the voyage for ships traveling between Spain and Peru. In 1668, the English physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne specifically proposed the Isthmus of Panama as the most convenient place for such a canal.

The first attempt actually to make the isthmus part of a trade route was the ill-fated Darien scheme, launched by the Kingdom of Scotland (1698–1700), which was abandoned because of the inhospitable conditions.

In 1811, the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt published an essay on the geography of the Spanish colonies in Central America (&quot;Essai politique sur le royaume de la Nouvelle Espagne&quot;; translated into English as: &quot;Political essay on the kingdom of New Spain containing researches relative to the geography of Mexico&quot;). In the essay, he considered five possible routes for a canal across Central America, including Panama, but concluded that the most promising location was across Nicaragua, traversing Lake Nicaragua. His recommendations influenced the British to attempt a canal across Nicaragua in 1843. Although this attempt in the end came to nothing, it resulted in the Clayton–Bulwer Treaty (1850) between the United Kingdom and the United States, in which the two nations bound each other to joint control of any canal built in Nicaragua or (by implication) anywhere in Central America.

 In 1846, the Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty, negotiated between the US and New Granada (the predecessor of Colombia), granted the United States transit rights and the right to intervene militarily in the isthmus. In 1848, the discovery of gold in California created a demand for a crossing of Panama as a practical route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. This demand was exploited by American businessman William Henry Aspinwall, who ran steamship legs from New York City to Panama, and from Panama to California, with an overland portage through Panama. This route was soon exploited by other businessmen, such as Cornelius Vanderbilt. Between 1850 and 1855, a syndicate founded by Aspinwall built a railroad (now the Panama Canal Railway) from Colón on the Caribbean Sea to Panama City. The project cost US$ 8,000,000 (six times the estimated cost) and between 6,000 and 12,000 of construction workers who succumbed to tropical diseases. However, the railroad soon became immensely profitable for its owners.

In 1870, U.S. President Grant established an Interoceanic Canal Commission, which included Chief of Engineers Brigadier General Andrew A Humphreys as its members. It commissioned several naval officers, including Commander Thomas Oliver Selfridge Jr., to investigate the possible routes suggested by Humboldt for a canal across Central America. The commission decided in favour of Nicaragua, establishing this as the preferred route amongst American policy-makers.

===French construction attempts, 1881–1899===
The French diplomat and entrepreneur Ferdinand de Lesseps was the driving force behind French attempts to construct the Panama canal (1881–1889). De Lesseps had made his reputation by successfully constructing the Suez Canal (1859–1869), a route which had soon proved its value in international commerce. After this success, he actively sought new projects. In 1875, de Lesseps was approached by the &quot;Societe Civile Internationale du Canal Interoceanique de Darien&quot; (also known as the &quot;Türr Syndicate&quot;), a syndicate formed to promote the building of an interoceanic canal across Panama. Its directors were Hungarian freedom fighter István Türr, financier Jacques de Reinach and Türr&#x27;s brother-in-law Lt Lucien Bonaparte-Wyse. Between 1876 and 1878, Bonaparte-Wyse and Armand Reclus investigated several potential routes across the Isthmus of Panama. Bonaparte-Wyse rode by horseback to Bogotá, where he obtained a concession from the Colombian government to build a canal across Panama (20 March 1878). The agreement, known as the &quot;Wyse Concession&quot; was valid 99 years and allowed the company to dig a canal and exploit it.

 In May 1879, de Lesseps convened an international congress in Paris to examine the possibilities of a ship canal across Central America. Among the 136 delegates of 26 countries, only 42 were engineers, with the remainder being speculators, politicians, and friends of de Lesseps. De Lesseps used the congress to promote fundraising for his preferred scheme, which was to build a sea-level canal across Panama, along similar lines to Suez. De Lesseps was able to gain approval of a majority of the delegates for his plan, despite reservations expressed by some who preferred a canal in Nicaragua or who emphasized the likely engineering difficulties and health risks. Following the congress, de Lesseps organized a company to construct the canal (the Compagnie Universelle du Canal Interocéanique de Panama). The company bought the Wyse Concession from the Türr Syndicate, and was able to raise considerable funds from small French investors, on the basis of the huge profits generated by the Suez Canal.

Construction of the canal began on 1 January 1881, with digging at Culebra beginning on January 22. A large labor force was assembled, numbering about 40,000 in 1888 (nine-tenths of whom were afro-Caribbean workers from the West Indies). Although the project attracted good, well-paid French engineers, retaining them was difficult due to disease. The death toll from 1881 to 1889 was estimated at over 22,000, of whom as many as 5,000 were French citizens.

 From the beginning, the French canal project faced difficulties. Although the Panama Canal needed to be only 40 percent as long as the Suez Canal, it was much more of an engineering challenge because of the combination of tropical rain forests, debilitating climate, the need for canal locks, and the lack of any ancient route to follow. Beginning with Armand Reclus in 1882, a series of principal engineers resigned in discouragement. The workers were unprepared for the conditions of the rainy season, during which the Chagres River, where the canal started, became a raging torrent, rising up to . Workers had to continually widen the main cut through the mountain at Culebra and reduce the angles of the slopes to minimize landslides into the canal. The dense jungle was alive with venomous snakes, insects, and spiders, but the worst challenges were yellow fever, malaria, and other tropical diseases, which killed thousands of workers; by 1884, the death rate was over 200 per month. Public health measures were ineffective because the role of the mosquito as a disease vector was then unknown. Conditions were downplayed in France to avoid recruitment problems, but the high mortality rate made it difficult to maintain an experienced workforce.

In France, de Lesseps kept the investment and supply of workers flowing long after it was obvious that the targets were not being met, but eventually, the money ran out. The French effort went bankrupt in 1889 after reportedly spending US$287,000,000 ; an estimated 22,000 men died from disease and accidents, and the savings of 800,000 investors were lost. Work was suspended on May 15, and in the ensuing scandal, known as the Panama affair, some of those deemed responsible were prosecuted, including Gustave Eiffel. De Lesseps and his son Charles were found guilty of misappropriation of funds and sentenced to five years&#x27; imprisonment. This sentence was later overturned, and the father, at age 88, was never imprisoned.

In 1894, a second French company, the Compagnie Nouvelle du Canal de Panama, was created to take over the project. A minimal workforce of a few thousand people was employed primarily to comply with the terms of the Colombian Panama Canal concession, to run the Panama Railroad, and to maintain the existing excavation and equipment in salable condition. The company sought a buyer for these assets, with an asking price of US$109,000,000 . In the meantime, they continued with enough activity to maintain their franchise. Two lobbyists would become particularly active in later negotiations to sell the interests of the Compagnie Nouvelle. The American lawyer William Nelson Cromwell began looking after the interests of the company in 1894, after first acting for the related Panama Railroad. He would become deeply involved as a lobbyist in the American decisions to continue the canal in Panama, and to support Panamanian independence. The other was Philippe Bunau-Varilla, who, as one of the major subcontractors to the first French company, had been compelled by the receivers to take shares in the Compagnie Nouvelle, and was then named director of engineering in the Compagnie Nouvelle.

===United States acquisition===


At this time, US President Theodore Roosevelt and the United States Senate were interested in establishing a canal across the isthmus, with some favoring a canal across Nicaragua and others advocating the purchase of the French interests in Panama. Bunau-Varilla, who was seeking American involvement, asked for $100 million, but accepted $40 million in the face of the Nicaraguan option. In June 1902, the US Senate voted in favor of the Spooner Act to pursue the Panamanian option, provided the necessary rights could be obtained.

On 22 January 1903, the Hay–Herrán Treaty was signed by United States Secretary of State John M. Hay and Colombian Chargé Tomás Herrán. For $10 million and an annual payment, it would have granted the United States a renewable lease in perpetuity from Colombia on the land proposed for the canal. The treaty was ratified by the US Senate on 14 March 1903, but the Senate of Colombia unanimously rejected the treaty since it had become significantly unpopular in Bogotá due to concerns over insufficient compensation, threat to sovereignty, and perpetuity.

Roosevelt changed tactics, based in part on the Mallarino–Bidlack Treaty of 1846, and actively supported the separation of Panama from Colombia. Shortly after recognizing Panama, he signed a treaty with the new Panamanian government under terms similar to the Hay–Herrán Treaty.

On 2 November 1903, US warships blocked sea lanes against possible Colombian troop movements en route to put down the Panama rebellion. Panama declared independence on 3 November 1903. The United States quickly recognized the new nation. This happened so quickly that by the time the Colombian government in Bogotá launched a response to the Panamanian uprising US troops had already entered the rebelling province. The Colombian troops dispatched to Panama were hastily assembled conscripts with little training. While these conscripts may have been able to defeat the Panamanian rebels, they would not have been able to defeat the US army troops that were supporting the Panamanian rebels. An army of conscripts was the best response the Colombians could muster, as Colombia was recovering from a civil war between Liberals and Conservatives from October 1899, to November 1902, known as the &quot;Thousand Days War&quot;. The US was fully aware of these conditions and even incorporated them into the planning of the Panama intervention as the US acted as an arbitrator between the two sides. The peace treaty that ended the &quot;Thousand Days War&quot; was signed on the USS &quot;Wisconsin&quot; on 21 November 1902. While in port, the US also brought engineering teams to Panama with the peace delegation to begin planning the canal&#x27;s construction before the US had even gained the rights to build the canal. All these factors would result in the Colombians being unable to put down the Panamanian rebellion and expel the United States troops occupying what today is the independent nation of Panama.

On 6 November 1903, Philippe Bunau-Varilla, as Panama&#x27;s ambassador to the United States, signed the Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty, granting rights to the United States to build and administer the Panama Canal Zone and its defenses. This treaty gave the US some rights to the canal &quot;in perpetuity&quot;, but in article 22 limited other rights to a lease period of 99 years. Almost immediately, the treaty was condemned by many Panamanians as an infringement on their country&#x27;s new national sovereignty. This would later become a contentious diplomatic issue among Colombia, Panama, and the United States.

President Roosevelt famously stated, &quot;I took the Isthmus, started the canal and then left Congress not to debate the canal, but to debate me.&quot; Several parties in the United States called this an act of war on Colombia: The &quot;New York Times&quot; described the support given by the United States to Bunau-Varilla as an &quot;act of sordid conquest&quot;. The &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; called it a &quot;vulgar and mercenary venture&quot;. The US maneuvers are often cited as the classic example of US gunboat diplomacy in Latin America, and the best illustration of what Roosevelt meant by the old African adage, &quot;Speak softly and carry a big stick [and] you will go far.&quot; After the revolution in 1903, the Republic of Panama became a US protectorate until 1939.

In 1904, the United States purchased the French equipment and excavations, including the Panama Railroad, for US$40 million, of which $30 million related to excavations completed, primarily in the Culebra Cut, valued at about . The United States also paid the new country of Panama $10 million and a $250,000 payment each following year.

In 1921, Colombia and the United States entered into the Thomson–Urrutia Treaty, in which the United States agreed to pay Colombia $25 million: $5 million upon ratification, and four $5 million annual payments, and grant Colombia special privileges in the Canal Zone. In return, Colombia recognized Panama as an independent nation.

===United States construction of the Panama canal, 1904–1914===

The US formally took control of the canal property on 4 May 1904, inheriting from the French a depleted workforce and a vast jumble of buildings, infrastructure, and equipment, much of it in poor condition. A US government commission, the Isthmian Canal Commission (ICC), was established to oversee construction; it was given control of the Panama Canal Zone, over which the United States exercised sovereignty. The commission reported directly to Secretary of War William Howard Taft and was directed to avoid the inefficiency and corruption that had plagued the French 15 years earlier.

On 6 May 1904, President Theodore Roosevelt appointed John Findley Wallace, formerly chief engineer and finally general manager of the Illinois Central Railroad, as chief engineer of the Panama Canal Project. Overwhelmed by the disease-plagued country and forced to use often dilapidated French infrastructure and equipment, as well as being frustrated by the overly bureaucratic ICC, Wallace resigned abruptly in June 1905. The ICC brought on a new chairman, Theodore P. Shonts, and a new chief engineer was appointed, John Frank Stevens, a self-educated engineer who had built the Great Northern Railroad. Stevens was not a member of the ICC; he increasingly viewed its bureaucracy as a serious hindrance, bypassing the commission and sending requests and demands directly to the Roosevelt administration in Washington, DC.

One of Stevens&#x27; first achievements in Panama was in building and rebuilding the housing, cafeterias, hotels, water systems, repair shops, warehouses, and other infrastructure needed by the thousands of incoming workers. Stevens began the recruitment effort to entice thousands of workers from the United States and other areas to come to the Canal Zone to work. Workers from the Caribbean—called &quot;Afro-Panamanians&quot;—came in large numbers and many settled permanently. Stevens tried to provide accommodation in which the workers could work and live in reasonable safety and comfort. He also re-established and enlarged the railway, which was to prove crucial in transporting millions of tons of soil from the cut through the mountains to the dam across the Chagres River.

Colonel William C. Gorgas had been appointed chief sanitation officer of the canal construction project in 1904. Gorgas implemented a range of measures to minimize the spread of deadly diseases, particularly yellow fever and malaria, which had recently been shown to be mosquito-borne following the work of Cuban epidemiologist Carlos Finlay, American pathologist Walter Reed and Scottish physician Sir Ronald Ross. Investment was made in extensive sanitation projects, including city water systems, fumigation of buildings, spraying of insect-breeding areas with oil and larvicide, installation of mosquito netting and window screens, and elimination of stagnant water. Despite opposition from the commission (one member said his ideas were barmy), Gorgas persisted, and when Stevens arrived, he threw his weight behind the project. After two years of extensive work, the mosquito-spread diseases were nearly eliminated. Despite the monumental effort, about 5,600 workers died from disease and accidents during the US construction phase of the canal. Of these, the great majority were West Indian laborers, particularly those from Barbados. The number of Americans who died was about 350.

Besides healthier and far better living conditions for the workers, another benefit given to American citizens working on the Canal was a medal for two years of service. Additional bars were added for each two-year period after that. Designed by Victor D. Brenner and featuring the then-current president they were popularly known as The Roosevelt Medal. A total of 7,189 were ultimately issued, with a few people receiving as many as four bars.

In 1905, a US engineering panel was commissioned to review the canal design, which had not been finalized. In January 1906 the panel, in a majority of eight to five, recommended to President Roosevelt a sea-level canal, as had been attempted by the French and temporarily abandoned by them in 1887 for a ten locks system designed by Philippe Bunau-Varilla, and definitively in 1898 for a lock-and-lake canal designed by the Comité Technique of the Compagnie Nouvelle de Canal de Panama as conceptualized by Adolphe Godin de Lépinay in 1879. But in 1906 Stevens, who had seen the Chagres in full flood, was summoned to Washington; he declared a sea-level approach to be &quot;an entirely untenable proposition&quot;. He argued in favor of a canal using a lock system to raise and lower ships from a large reservoir above sea level. This would create both the largest dam (Gatun Dam) and the largest human-made lake (Gatun Lake) in the world at that time. The water to refill the locks would be taken from Gatun Lake by opening and closing enormous gates and valves and letting gravity propel the water from the lake. Gatun Lake would connect to the Pacific through the mountains at the Gaillard (Culebra) Cut. Unlike Godin de Lépinay with the Congrès International d&#x27;Etudes du Canal Interocéanique, Stevens successfully convinced Roosevelt of the necessity and feasibility of this alternative scheme.

The construction of a canal with locks required the excavation of more than of material over and above the excavated by the French. As quickly as possible, the Americans replaced or upgraded the old, unusable French equipment with new construction equipment that was designed for a much larger and faster scale of work. Over a hundred railroad-mounted steam shovels were purchased, 77 from Bucyrus-Erie and 25 from the Marion Power Shovel Company. These were joined by enormous steam-powered cranes, giant hydraulic rock crushers, concrete mixers, dredges, and pneumatic power drills, nearly all of which were manufactured by new, extensive machine-building technology developed and built in the United States. The railroad also had to be comprehensively upgraded with heavy-duty, double-tracked rails over most of the line to accommodate new rolling stock. In many places, the new Gatun Lake flooded over the original rail line, and a new line had to be constructed above Gatun Lake&#x27;s waterline.

Between 1912 and 1914 there was a controversy about the tolls for the canal.
===Goethals replaces Stevens as chief engineer===
In 1907, Stevens resigned as chief engineer. His replacement, appointed by President Theodore Roosevelt, was US Army Major George Washington Goethals of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Soon to be promoted to lieutenant colonel and later to general, he was a strong, West Point-trained leader and civil engineer with experience in canals (unlike Stevens). Goethals directed the work in Panama to a successful conclusion in 1914, two years ahead of the target date of 10 June 1916.

Goethals divided the engineering and excavation work into three divisions: Atlantic, Central, and Pacific. The Atlantic Division, under Major William L. Sibert, was responsible for construction of the massive breakwater at the entrance to Bahía Limón, the Gatun locks, and their approach channel, and the immense Gatun Dam. The Pacific Division, under Sydney B. Williamson (the only civilian member of this high-level team), was similarly responsible for the Pacific breakwater in Panama Bay, the approach channel to the locks, and the Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks and their associated dams and reservoirs.

The Central Division, under Major David du Bose Gaillard of the United States Army Corps of Engineers, was assigned one of the most difficult parts: excavating the Culebra Cut through the continental divide to connect Gatun Lake to the Pacific Panama Canal locks.
On 10 October 1913, President Woodrow Wilson sent a signal from the White House by telegraph which triggered the explosion that destroyed the Gamboa Dike. This flooded the Culebra Cut, thereby joining the Atlantic and Pacific oceans via the Panama Canal. &quot;Alexandre La Valley&quot; (a floating crane built by Lobnitz &amp; Company and launched in 1887) was the first self-propelled vessel to transit the canal from ocean to ocean. This vessel crossed the canal from the Atlantic in stages during construction, finally reaching the Pacific on 7 January 1914. SS &quot;Cristobal&quot; (a cargo and passenger ship built by Maryland Steel, and launched in 1902 as SS &quot;Tremont&quot;) on 3 August 1914, was the first ship to transit the canal from ocean to ocean.

The construction of the canal was completed in 1914, 401 years after Panama was first crossed overland by the Europeans in Vasco Núñez de Balboa&#x27;s party of conquistadores. The United States spent almost $500 million (roughly equivalent to $ billion in ) to finish the project. This was by far the largest American engineering project to date. The canal was formally opened on 15 August 1914, with the passage of the cargo ship .

The opening of the Panama Canal in 1914 caused a severe drop in traffic along Chilean ports due to shifts in maritime trade routes, despite the closure of the canal for nearly seven months after a landslide in the Culebra Cut on 18 September 1915. The burgeoning sheep farming business in southern Patagonia suffered a significant setback by the change in trade routes, as did the economy of the Falkland Islands.

Throughout this time, Ernest &quot;Red&quot; Hallen was hired by the Isthmian Canal Commission to document the progress of the work.

In 1914, steam shovels from the Panama Canal were purchased and put to use in Chuquicamata copper mine of northern Chile.

===Later developments===

By the 1930s, water supply became an issue for the canal, prompting construction of the Madden Dam across the Chagres River above Gatun Lake. Completed in 1935, the dam created Madden Lake (later Lake Alajuela), which provides additional water storage for the canal. In 1939, construction began on a further major improvement: a new set of locks large enough to carry the larger warships that the United States was building at the time and planned to continue building. The work proceeded for several years, and significant excavation was carried out on the new approach channels, but the project was canceled after World War II.

After World War II, US control of the canal and the Canal Zone surrounding it became contentious; relations between Panama and the United States became increasingly tense. Many Panamanians felt that the Zone rightfully belonged to Panama; student protests were met by the fencing-in of the zone and an increased military presence there. Demands for the United States to hand over the canal to Panama increased after the Suez Crisis in 1956, when the United States used financial and diplomatic pressure to force France and the UK to abandon their attempt to retake control of the Suez Canal, previously nationalized by the Nasser regime in Egypt. Panamanian unrest culminated in riots on Martyr&#x27;s Day, 9 January 1964, when about 20 Panamanians and 3–5 US soldiers were killed.

A decade later, in 1974, negotiations toward a settlement began and resulted in the Torrijos–Carter Treaties. On 7 September 1977, the treaty was signed by President of the United States Jimmy Carter and Omar Torrijos, &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Panama. This mobilized the process of granting the Panamanians free control of the canal so long as Panama signed a treaty guaranteeing the permanent neutrality of the canal. The treaty led to full Panamanian control effective at noon on 31 December 1999, and the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) assumed command of the waterway. The Panama Canal remains one of the chief revenue sources for Panama.

Before this handover, the government of Panama held an international bid to negotiate a 25-year contract for operation of the container shipping ports located at the canal&#x27;s Atlantic and Pacific outlets. The contract was not affiliated with the ACP or Panama Canal operations and was won by the firm Hutchison Whampoa, a Hong Kong–based shipping interest owned by Li Ka-shing.

=== 21st century ===

==== Donald Trump comments and reactions ====
On 21 December 2024, then U.S. President-elect Donald Trump asserted that the United States should retake control of the Panama Canal from Panama, claiming that the rates Panama was charging American ships were &quot;exorbitant&quot; and in violation of the Torrijos–Carter Treaties. The following day, he claimed that the canal was &quot;falling into the wrong hands&quot;, referring to China. Shortly after Trump&#x27;s comments, Panamanian president José Raúl Mulino responded, denying that the United States was being unfairly charged or that anyone besides Panama was in full control of the canal, and affirming that the canal was part of the country&#x27;s &quot;inalienable patrimony&quot;.

Though the Hong Kong company Hutchison Port Holdings does have a concession to operate two ports near the ends of the canal – the Balboa port on the Pacific side and the Cristóbal port on the Atlantic side – neither these ports nor the company control access to the canal. Three other ports near the canal&#x27;s ends are operated by companies from Taiwan and Singapore, and joint venture from the United States and Panama. The government of Panama receives dividends from the Hutchinson concession, but the locks and Marine Traffic Control are run independently by the Panama Canal Authority, and the harbor pilots that guide ships are Panamanian.

On 24 December, a protest was held at the U.S. Embassy in Panama City over Trump&#x27;s threat to take back the Panama Canal. Protesters referred to him as a &quot;public enemy&quot; of Panama. On the same day, the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America (ALBA), made up of ten Central and South American countries, denounced Trump&#x27;s comments and affirmed its support for Panama&#x27;s &quot;sovereignty, territorial integrity and self-determination.&quot;

In a 7 January 2025 press conference, Trump vowed to gain control of the Panama Canal. He refused to rule out economic and military action against Panama to seize control of the canal, to secure what he called U.S. &quot;economic security.&quot; He reiterated his intent to take back control of the canal in his inaugural address on 20 January.

On 5 February, the United States Department of State posted on Twitter that the Panama Canal would no longer be charging United States government vessels to cross. President Mulino called this an &quot;intolerable&quot; falsehood, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio (who had departed Panama a few days earlier) had to correct the announcement, saying he &quot;expects&quot; Panama to begin doing so in return for the Torrijos–Carter Treaties&#x27; guarantee of US military protection in the event of an attack the canal.

==Canal==

===Layout===

While globally the Atlantic Ocean is east of the isthmus and the Pacific is west, the general direction of the canal passage from the Atlantic to the Pacific is from northwest to southeast, because of the shape of the isthmus at the point the canal occupies. The Bridge of the Americas () at the Pacific side is about a third of a degree east of the Colón end on the Atlantic side. Still, in formal nautical communications, the simplified directions &quot;southbound&quot; and &quot;northbound&quot; are used.

The canal consists of artificial lakes, several improved and artificial channels, and three sets of locks. An additional artificial lake, Alajuela Lake (known during the American era as Madden Lake), acts as a reservoir for the canal. The layout of the canal as seen by a ship passing from the Atlantic to the Pacific is:

* From the formal marking line of the Atlantic Entrance, one enters Limón Bay (Bahía Limón), a large natural harbor. The entrance runs . It provides a deepwater port (Cristóbal), with facilities like multimodal cargo exchange (to and from train) and the Colón Free Trade Zone (a free port).
* A channel forms the approach to the locks from the Atlantic side.
* The Gatun Locks, a three-stage flight of locks long, lifts ships to the Gatun Lake level, some above sea level.
* Gatun Lake, an artificial lake formed by the building of the Gatun Dam, carries vessels across the isthmus. It is the summit canal stretch, fed by the Gatun River and emptied by basic lock operations.
* From the lake, the Chagres River, a natural waterway enhanced by the damming of Gatun Lake, runs about . Here the upper Chagres River feeds the high-level-canal stretch.
* The Culebra Cut slices through the mountain ridge, crosses the continental divide and passes under the Centennial Bridge.
* The single-stage Pedro Miguel Lock, which is long, is the first part of the descent with a lift of .
* The artificial Miraflores Lake long, and above sea level.
* The two-stage Miraflores Locks is long, with a total descent of at mid-tide.
* From the Miraflores Locks one reaches Balboa harbor, again with multimodal exchange provision (here the railway meets the shipping route again). Nearby is Panama City.
* From this harbor an entrance/exit channel leads to the Pacific Ocean (Gulf of Panama), from the Miraflores Locks, passing under the Bridge of the Americas.

Thus, the total length of the canal is . In 2017 it took ships an average of 11.38 hours to pass between the canal&#x27;s two outer locks.

===Navigation===
===Gatun Lake===

Created in 1913 by damming the Chagres River, the Gatun Lake is a key part of the Panama Canal, providing the millions of liters of water necessary to operate its locks each time a ship passes through. At time of formation, Gatun Lake was the largest human-made lake in the world.

===Lock size===

Because of the importance of the canal to international trade, many ships are built to the maximum size allowed.
For its first century, the width and length of ships that may transit the canal was limited by the Pedro Miguel Locks; their draft by the canal&#x27;s minimum depth; and their height by the main span of the Bridge of the Americas at Balboa. Ships built to those limits are known as Panamax vessels. A Panamax cargo ship typically has a deadweight tonnage (DWT) of 65,000–80,000 tons, but its actual cargo is restricted to about 52,500 tons because of the canal&#x27;s draft restrictions within the canal. The longest ship ever to transit the canal was the &quot;San Juan Prospector&quot; (now &quot;Marcona Prospector&quot;), an ore-bulk-oil carrier that is long with a beam of .

Initially the locks at Gatun were designed to be wide. In 1908, the United States Navy requested that the width be increased to at least to allow the passage of large warships. A compromise was made and the locks were built wide. Each lock is long, with the walls ranging in thickness from at the base to at the top. The central wall between the parallel locks at Gatun is thick and over high. The steel lock gates measure an average of thick, wide, and high.

Panama Canal pilots were initially unprepared to handle the flight decks of aircraft carriers, which protrude beyond the hull on either side of the ship. When made her first trip through the Gatun Locks in 1928, the ship knocked over all the concrete lamp posts along the canal.

In 2016, a decade-long expansion project created larger locks, allowing bigger ships to transit through deeper and wider channels. The allowed dimensions of ships using these locks increased by 25 percent in length, 51 percent in beam, and 26 percent in draft, as defined by Neopanamax metrics.

===Tolls===

As with a toll road, vessels transiting the canal must pay tolls. Tolls for the canal are set by the Panama Canal Authority and are based on vessel type, size, and the type of cargo.

For container ships, the toll is assessed on the ship&#x27;s capacity expressed in twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), one TEU being the size of a standard intermodal shipping container. Effective 1 April 2016, this toll went from US$74 per loaded container to $60 per TEU capacity plus $30 per loaded container for a potential $90 per TEU when the ship is full. A Panamax container ship may carry up to . The toll is calculated differently for passenger ships and for container ships carrying no cargo (&quot;in ballast&quot;). , the ballast rate is US$60, down from US$65.60 per TEU.

Passenger vessels in excess of 30,000 tons (PC/UMS) pay a rate based on the number of berths, that is, the number of passengers that can be accommodated in permanent beds. Since 1 April 2016, the per-berth charge is $111 for unoccupied berths and $138 for occupied berths in the Panamax locks. Starting in 2007, this fee has greatly increased the tolls for such ships. Passenger vessels of less than 30,000 tons or less than 33 tons per passenger are charged according to the same per-ton schedule as are freighters. Almost all major cruise ships have more than 33 tons per passenger; the rule of thumb for cruise line comfort is generally given as a minimum of 40 tons per passenger.

Most other types of vessels pay a toll per PC/UMS net ton, in which one &quot;ton&quot; is actually a volume of . (The calculation of tonnage for commercial vessels is quite complex.) , this toll is US$5.25 per ton for the first 10,000 tons, US$5.14 per ton for the next 10,000 tons, and US$5.06 per ton thereafter. As with container ships, reduced tolls are charged for freight ships &quot;in ballast&quot;, $4.19, $4.12, $4.05 respectively.

On 1 April 2016, a more complicated toll system was introduced, having the neopanamax locks at a higher rate in some cases, natural gas transport as a new separate category and other changes. As of 1 October 2017, there are modified tolls and categories of tolls in effect. Small (less than 125 ft) vessels up to 583 PC/UMS net tons when carrying passengers or cargo, or up to 735 PC/UMS net tons when in ballast, or up to 1,048 fully loaded displacement tons, are assessed minimum tolls based upon their length overall, according to the following table (as of 29 April 2015):
Morgan Adams of Los Angeles, California, holds the distinction of paying the first toll received by the U.S. government for the use of the Panama Canal by a pleasure boat. His boat &quot;Lasata&quot; passed through the Zone on 14 August 1914. The crossing occurred during a sea voyage from Jacksonville, Florida, to Los Angeles in 1914.

The most expensive regular toll for canal passage to date was charged on 14 April 2010, to the cruise ship &quot;Norwegian Pearl,&quot; which paid US$375,600. The average toll is around US$54,000. The highest fee for priority passage charged through the Transit Slot Auction System was US$220,300, paid on 24 August 2006, by the Panamax tanker &quot;Erikoussa&quot;, bypassing a 90-ship queue waiting for the end of maintenance work on the Gatun Locks, and thus avoiding a seven-day delay. The normal fee would have been just US$13,430.

The lowest toll ever paid was 36 cents (), by American Richard Halliburton who swam the Panama Canal in 1928.

==Issues leading to expansion==
===Efficiency and maintenance===
Opponents to the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties feared that efficiency and maintenance would suffer following the U.S. withdrawal from the Panama Canal Zone; however, this has been proven not to be the case. In 2004, it was reported that canal operations, capitalizing on practices developed during the American administration, were improving under Panamanian control. Canal Waters Time (CWT), the average time it takes a vessel to navigate the canal, including waiting time, is a key measure of efficiency; in the first decade of the 2000s, it ranged between 20 and 30 hours, according to the ACP. The accident rate has also not changed appreciably in the past decade, varying between 10 and 30 accidents each year from about 14,000 total annual transits. An official accident is one in which a formal investigation is requested and conducted.

Increasing volumes of imports from Asia, which previously landed on US West Coast ports, are now passing through the canal to the American East Coast. The total number of ocean-going transits increased from 11,725 in 2003 to 13,233 in 2007, falling to 12,855 in 2009. (The canal&#x27;s fiscal year runs from October through September.) This has been coupled with a steady rise in average ship size and in the numbers of Panamax vessels passing through the canal, so that the total tonnage carried rose from 227.9 million PC/UMS tons in fiscal year 1999 to a then record high of 312.9 million tons in 2007, and falling to 299.1 million tons in 2009. Tonnage for fiscal 2013, 2014 and 2015 was 320.6, 326.8 and 340.8 million PC/UMS tons carried on 13,660, 13,481 and 13,874 transits respectively.

In the first decade after the transfer to Panamanian control, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) invested nearly US$1 billion in widening and modernizing the canal, with the aim of increasing capacity by 20 percent. The ACP cites a number of major improvements, including the widening and straightening of the Culebra Cut to reduce restrictions on passing vessels, the deepening of the navigational channel in Gatun Lake to reduce draft restrictions and improve water supply, and the deepening of the Atlantic and Pacific entrances to the canal. This is supported by new equipment, such as a new drill barge and suction dredger, and an increase of the tug boat fleet by 20 percent. In addition, improvements have been made to the canal&#x27;s operating machinery, including an increased and improved tug locomotive fleet, the replacement of more than of locomotive track, and new lock machinery controls. Improvements have been made to the traffic management system to allow more efficient control over ships in the canal.

In December 2010, record-breaking rains caused a 17-hour closure of the canal; this was the first closure since the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1989. The rains also caused an access road to the Centenario Bridge to collapse.

===Capacity===

The canal handles more vessel traffic than had ever been envisioned by its builders. In 1934 it was estimated that the maximum capacity of the canal would be around 80 million tons per year; as noted above, canal traffic in 2015 reached 340.8 million tons of shipping.

To improve capacity, a number of improvements have been made to maximize the use of the locking system:
* Implementation of an enhanced locks lighting system;
* Construction of two tie-up stations in Culebra Cut;
* Widening Culebra Cut from ;
* Improvements to the tugboat fleet;
* Implementation of the carousel lockage system in Gatun locks;
* Development of an improved vessel scheduling system;
* Deepening of Gatun Lake navigational channels from PLD;
* Modification of all locks structures to allow an additional draft of about ;
* Deepening of the Pacific and Atlantic entrances;
* Construction of a new spillway in Gatun, for flood control.
These improvements enlarged the capacity from 300 million PCUMS (2008) to 340 PCUMS (2012). These improvements were started before the new locks project, and are complementary to it.

===Competition===

The canal faces increasing competition from other quarters. Because canal tolls have risen as ships have become larger, some critics have suggested that the Suez Canal is now a viable alternative for cargo between Asia and the US East Coast. The Panama Canal, however, continues to serve more than 144 of the world&#x27;s trade routes and the majority of canal traffic comes from the &quot;all-water route&quot; from Asia to the US East and Gulf Coasts.

An alternative route through Nicaragua and Lake Nicaragua has been proposed. On 15 June 2013, Nicaragua awarded the Hong Kong-based HKND Group a 50-year concession to develop a canal through the country. In February 2018, analysts widely viewed the project as defunct, though the head of the project insisted work was on-going. In April 2018 HKND Group closed its offices, leaving no forwarding address or telephone numbers to be reached.

The increasing rate of melting of ice in the Arctic Ocean has led to speculation that the Northwest Passage or Arctic Bridge may become viable for commercial shipping. This route would save on the route from Asia to Europe compared with the Panama Canal, possibly leading to a diversion of some traffic to that route. However, such a route is beset by unresolved territorial issues and would still hold significant problems owing to ice.

===Water issues===

Gatun Lake is filled with rainwater, and the lake accumulates excess water during wet months. For the old locks, water is lost to the oceans at a rate of per downward lock movement. The ship&#x27;s submerged volume is not relevant to this amount of water.

During the dry season, when there is less rainfall, there is also a shortage of water in Gatun Lake.

As a signatory to the 2000 United Nations Global Compact and member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, the ACP developed an environmentally and socially sustainable program for expansion, which protects the aquatic and terrestrial resources of the canal watershed. The expansion uses three water-saving basins at each new lock, diminishing water loss. It also preserves freshwater resources along the waterway by reusing 60 percent of water from the basins in the locks in each transit.

The mean sea level at the Pacific side is about higher than that of the Atlantic side due to differences in ocean conditions such as water density and weather.

The 2015–2016 fiscal year was one of the driest periods on record, restricting ships passage; 2019 was the fifth driest year for 70 years. Temperature rise has also caused an increase in evaporation. In normal times, 36 ships can transit the canal each day, but in early December 2023, ships were backing up because only 22 ships per day could transit due to low water levels. In January 2024, 24 ships per day were allowed to transit.

==Third set of locks project (expansion)==

As demand is rising for efficient global shipping of goods, the canal is positioned to be a significant feature of world shipping for the foreseeable future. However, changes in shipping patterns—particularly the increasing numbers of larger-than-Panamax ships—necessitated changes to the canal for it to retain a significant market share. In 2006 it was anticipated that by 2011, 37 percent of the world&#x27;s container ships would be too large for the present canal, and hence a failure to expand would result in a significant loss of market share. The maximum sustainable capacity of the original canal, given some relatively minor improvement work, was estimated at 340 million PC/UMS tons per year; it was anticipated that this capacity would be reached between 2009 and 2012. Close to 50 percent of transiting vessels were already using the full width of the locks.

An enlargement scheme to allow for a greater number of transits and the ability to handle larger ships, similar to the Third Lock Scheme of 1939, had been under consideration for some time, and by 2006 Panama&#x27;s government canal authority was recommending such a plan. The expansion proposal, with a cost estimate of , was expected to double the canal&#x27;s shipping capacity by allowing both the passage of longer and wider Post-Panamax ships and an increase in overall traffic. This proposal was approved in a national referendum by about 80 percent on 22 October 2006. The canal expansion was built between 2007 and 2016.
The expansion plan had two new flights of locks built parallel to, and operated in addition to, the old locks: one east of the existing Gatun locks, and one southwest of the Miraflores locks, each supported by approach channels. Each flight ascends from sea level directly to the level of Gatun Lake; the existing two-stage ascent at Miraflores and Pedro Miguel locks was not replicated. The new lock chambers feature sliding gates, doubled for safety, and are long, wide, and deep. This allows the transit of vessels with a beam of up to , an overall length of up to and a draft of up to , equivalent to a container ship carrying around 12,000 containers, each in length (TEU).

The new locks are supported by new approach channels, including a channel at Miraflores from the locks to the Gaillard Cut, skirting Miraflores Lake. Each of these channels is wide, which will require post-Panamax vessels to navigate the channels in one direction at a time. The Gaillard Cut and the channel through Gatun Lake were widened to at least on the straight portions and at least on the bends. The maximum level of Gatun Lake was raised from .

Each flight of locks is accompanied by nine water reuse basins (three per lock chamber), each basin being about wide, long and deep. These gravity-fed basins allow 60 percent of the water used in each transit to be reused; the new locks consequently use 7 percent less water per transit than each of the existing lock lanes. The deepening of Gatun Lake and the raising of its maximum water level also provide capacity for significantly more water storage. These measures are intended to allow the expanded canal to operate without constructing new reservoirs.

The estimated cost of the project is . The project was designed to allow for an anticipated growth in traffic from 280 million PC/UMS tons in 2005 to nearly 510 million PC/UMS tons in 2025. The expanded canal will have a maximum sustainable capacity of about 600 million PC/UMS tons per year. Tolls will continue to be calculated based on vessel tonnage, and in some cases depend on the locks used.

An article in the February 2007 issue of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; magazine described the engineering aspects of the expansion project. There is also a follow-up article in the February 2010 issue of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;.

On 3 September 2007, thousands of Panamanians stood across from Paraíso Hill in Panama to witness a huge initial explosion and launch of the Expansion Program. The first phase of the project was the dry excavations of the wide trench connecting the Gaillard Cut with the Pacific coast, removing 47 million cubic meters of earth and rock. By June 2012, a 30 m reinforced concrete monolith had been completed, the first of 46 such monoliths which will line the new Pacific-side lock walls. By early July 2012, however, it was announced that the canal expansion project had fallen six months behind schedule, leading expectations for the expansion to open in April 2015 rather than October 2014, as originally planned. By September 2014, the new gates were projected to be open for transit at the &quot;beginning of 2016&quot;.
It was announced in July 2009 that the Belgian dredging company Jan De Nul, together with a consortium of contractors consisting of the Spanish Sacyr Vallehermoso, the Italian Impregilo, and the Panamanian company Grupo Cusa, had been awarded the contract to build the six new locks for US$3.1 billion, which was one billion less than the next highest competing bid due to having a concrete budget 71 percent smaller than that of the next bidder and allotted roughly 25 percent less for steel to reinforce that concrete. The contract resulted in $100 million in dredging works over the next few years for the Belgian company and a great deal of work for its construction division. The design of the locks is a carbon copy of the Berendrecht Lock, which is 68 m wide and 500 m long, making it the second largest lock in the world after the Kieldrecht lock in the port of Antwerp, Belgium. Completed in 1989 by the Port of Antwerp, which De Nul helped build, the company still has engineers and specialists who were part of that project.

In January 2014, a contract dispute threatened the progress of the project. There was a delay of less than two months however, with work by the consortium members reaching goals by June 2014.

In June 2015, flooding of the new locks began: first on the Atlantic side, then on the Pacific; by then, the canal&#x27;s re-inauguration was slated for April 2016. On 23 March 2016, the expansion inauguration was set for 26 June 2016.

The new locks opened for commercial traffic on 26 June 2016, and the first ship to cross the canal using the third set of locks was a modern Neopanamax vessel, the Chinese-owned container ship &quot;Cosco Shipping Panama&quot;. The original locks, now over 100 years old, allow engineers greater access for maintenance, and are projected to continue operating indefinitely. After the construction of the new locks, in addition to the already existing ones, to date the ship with the largest dimensions transiting the &quot;Panama Canal new sideway&quot;, had the following dimensions: 366.47 meters in length, 48.23 meters in width and 15 meters draft.

The total cost is unknown since the expansion&#x27;s contractors are seeking at least an additional from the canal authority due to excess expenses.

==Environmental and ecological consequences==
The Panama Canal, one of the most important chokepoints in global trade, has caused many environmental and ecological problems since it was built and expanded. These problems include deforestation, the spread of invasive species, water and air pollution, and water shortage.

Deforestation in the Panama Canal drainage basin has been a problem for decades. In 1978, researchers said that &quot;clearing the forest in the [drainage basin] might kill the canal.&quot; By 1985, the forested area had dropped to 30%. As of 2000, deforestation from human population growth, land degradation, and erosion continued to harm the ecosystem. Deforestation causes erosion, which raises the bottoms of the Gatún and Alajuela Lakes and lowers their ability to hold water. These lakes are very important for both canal operations and the local water supply.

The Panama Canal has made it easier for invasive species to move between oceans. When the canal was expanded in 2016 with the third set of locks, global trade increased, and so did the spread of invasive species. These species cling to the ship and move from one place to another, something that without the boats they would not have been able to do. One example is the Asian green mussel, first found in Caribbean waters in the late 1990s, which has spread through the canal. These invasive species can harm local ecosystems and compete with native species.

Ships passing through the canal regularly pollute the water. For example, in 1986, a crude oil spill east of the Caribbean entrance to the canal killed plants and invertebrates in the area. The shipping industry also releases emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. The Panama Canal, as a chokepoint, has a lot of heavy traffic and delays, which leads to burning more fuel and producing more emissions than needed. These emissions are a major concern because they contribute to climate change and increase environmental problems.

The Panama Canal uses a lot of fresh water from the Gatún Lake, which is Panama City&#x27;s primary source of potable water. For each ship that passes through, about 200 million liters (52 million gallons) of freshwater are needed. This water use has serious environmental and social impacts. During a drought in 2019, Gatún Lake&#x27;s water levels dropped to historic lows because so much water was being used for the canal.

==Routes competing with the canal==

===Nicaragua canal===
On 7 July 2014, Wang Jing, chairman of the HK Nicaragua Canal Development Investment Co. Ltd. (HKND Group) advised that a route for Nicaragua&#x27;s proposed canal had been approved. The construction work was projected by HKND to begin in 2014 and take five years, although there had been little progress before the project&#x27;s abandonment. The Nicaraguan parliament approved plans for the canal through Nicaragua and according to the deal, the company would have been responsible for operating and maintaining the canal for a 50-year period. By May 2017, no concrete action had been reportedly taken constructing the canal and further doubts were expressed about its financing. In February 2018, analysts widely viewed the project as defunct, though the head of the project insisted work was on-going and HKND retained the legal rights to the concession for the canal as well as side projects. Despite HKND vanishing in April 2018, the Nicaraguan government indicates that it will continue with the dry land expropriations within Nicaragua, under land expropriation Canal Law 840.

===Colombia rail link===
In 2011, Colombia&#x27;s then-president Juan Manuel Santos announced a proposal for a railway between Colombia&#x27;s Pacific and Caribbean coasts. However, in 2015 the director of the Colombia-China Chamber of Commerce said the proposal &quot;was mentioned in 2011 and subsequently had minimal relevance&quot;.

===Northwest Passage===
Climate change has thinned much of the Arctic ice that in the past made this route between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans impassable. Satellite navigation can help monitor location of the ice which remains, further easing transit. A few ships have successfully crossed the previously impossible route since 2000.

===Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec===

Since 2019, Mexico has been building a corridor of its own, known as the Interoceanic Corridor of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (CIIT, by its initials in Spanish), which will use primarily a railway, the &quot;Tren Interoceánico&quot;, to transport cargo and passengers from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic. It opened for passenger service on 22 December 2023, and all the works related to it to had begun operation by July 2024. This idea is older than the Panama Canal itself, with the original Tehuantepec Railway, which is being rehabilitated for the CIIT, being inaugurated in 1907 to initial success, but falling out of use due to the Mexican Revolution and the opening of the Panama Canal in 1914. The current Corridor is expected to have certain advantages over the Panama Canal, such as its speed, being able to transport cargo from one ocean to the other in about six hours, and its location, being closer to the United States than Panama, in addition to the creation of ten industrial parks in the Isthmus with various tax benefits to encourage private investment. However, despite being often described as a potential alternative/competitor to the Panama Canal, the ambassador of Panama in Mexico, Alfredo Oranges, and the former director of the CIIT, Rafael Marín Mollinedo, have stated that they do not see the CIIT in this way, and that they prefer to see it as a &quot;complement&quot; to the Panama Canal, which could relieve the intense traffic the Canal has to cope with. The ambassador even proposed collaborating with the Mexican government to make the Corridor more efficient.

===Other projects===
Individuals, companies, and governments have explored the possibility of constructing deep water ports and rail links connecting coasts as a &quot;dry canal&quot; in Guatemala, Costa Rica, and El Salvador/Honduras. However, plans to construct these sea-rail-sea links have yet to materialize.

==Master Key to Panama Canal and Honorary Pilots==
During the last one hundred years, the Panama Canal Authority has granted membership in the &quot;Esteemed Order of Bearers of the Master Key of the Panama Canal&quot; and appointed a few &quot;Honorary Lead Pilots&quot; to employees, captains and dignitaries. One of the most recent was U.S. Federal Maritime Commissioner Louis Sola, who was awarded for his work for supporting seafarers during the COVID-19 pandemic and previously transiting the canal more than 100 times. On the date of 25 April 2006, was awarded the title of Panama Canal Honorary Pilot the Senior Captain Raffaele Minotauro, an Unlimited Oceangoing Shipmaster Senior Grade, of the former Italian governmental navigation company known as the &quot;Italian Line&quot;. This award was also given to Commodore Ronald Warwick in 2014, a former Master of the Cunard Liners &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; and RMS &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;, who has traversed the Canal more than 50 times.

<text>Political fiction employs narrative to comment on political events, systems and theories. Works of political fiction, such as political novels, often &quot;directly criticize an existing society or present an alternative, even fantastic, reality&quot;. The political novel overlaps with the social novel, proletarian novel, and social science fiction.

Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, a Socratic dialogue written around 380 BC, has been one of the world&#x27;s most influential works of philosophy and political theory, both intellectually and historically. The &quot;Republic&quot; is concerned with justice (δικαιοσύνη), the order and character of the just city-state, and the just man. Other influential politically themed works include Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;Utopia&quot; (1516), Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; (1726), Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot; (1759), and Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852).

Political fiction frequently employs satire, often in the utopian and dystopian genres.
This includes totalitarian dystopias of the early 20th century such as Jack London&#x27;s &quot;The Iron Heel&quot;, Sinclair Lewis&#x27; &quot;It Can&#x27;t Happen Here&quot;, and George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;.

==Political satire==
The Greek playwright Aristophanes&#x27; plays are known for their political and social satire, particularly in his criticism of the powerful Athenian general, Cleon, in plays such as &quot;The Knights&quot;. Aristophanes is also notable for the persecution he underwent. Aristophanes&#x27; plays turned upon images of filth and disease. His bawdy style was adopted by Greek dramatist-comedian Menander, whose early play, &quot;Drunkenness&quot;, contains an attack on the politician, Callimedon.

Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;A Modest Proposal&quot; (1729) is an 18th-century Juvenalian satirical essay in which he suggests that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. The satirical hyperbole mocks heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as British policy toward the Irish in general.

George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Animal Farm&quot; (1945) is an allegorical and dystopian novella which satirises the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Soviet Union&#x27;s Stalinist era. Orwell, a democratic socialist, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and was hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism—an attitude that had been shaped by his experiences during the Spanish Civil War. The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal dictatorship, built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror. Orwell described his &quot;Animal Farm&quot; as &quot;a satirical tale against Stalin&quot;, and in his essay &quot;Why I Write&quot; (1946) he wrote that &quot;Animal Farm&quot; was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, &quot;to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole.&quot;

Orwell&#x27;s most famous work, however, is &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (published in 1949), many of whose terms and concepts, such as &quot;Big Brother&quot;, &quot;doublethink&quot;, &quot;thoughtcrime&quot;, &quot;Newspeak&quot;, &quot;Room 101&quot;, &quot;telescreen&quot;, &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot;, and &quot;memory hole&quot;, have entered into common use. &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; popularised the adjective &quot;Orwellian&quot;, which describes official deception, secret surveillance, and manipulation of recorded history by a totalitarian or authoritarian state.

==16th-century novel==
The poet Jan Kochanowski&#x27;s play &quot;The Dismissal of the Greek Envoys&quot; (1578), the first tragedy written in the Polish language, recounts an incident leading up to the Trojan War. Its theme of the responsibilities of statesmanship resonates to the present day.

The book &quot;Utopia&quot; (1516), written by Sir Thomas More, talk about a story of a different world compared to the one they live in. The character Thomas More is sent by King Henry VIII of England to negotiate the English wool trade. There he meets a man by the name Raphael Hythloday. He is a man that has been to the island on Utopia. He explains to More how their entire philosophy is to find happiness and share everything collectively; in this society, money does not exist, which starkly contrasts with the ascendant commercial empires in Thomas More&#x27;s Europe.

==18th-century novel==
The political comedy &quot;The Return of the Deputy&quot; (1790), by Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz—Polish poet, playwright, statesman, and comrade-in-arms of Tadeusz Kościuszko—was written in about two weeks&#x27; time while Niemcewicz was serving as a deputy to the historic Four-Year Sejm of 1788–92. The comedy&#x27;s premiere in January 1791 was an enormous success, sparking widespread debate, royal communiques, and diplomatic correspondence. As Niemcewicz had hoped, it set the stage for passage of Poland&#x27;s epochal Constitution of 3 May 1791, which is regarded as Europe&#x27;s first, and the world&#x27;s second, modern written national constitution, after the United States Constitution implemented in 1789. The comedy pits proponents against opponents of political reforms: of abolishing the destabilizing free election of Poland&#x27;s kings; of abolishing the legislatively destructive &quot;liberum veto&quot;; of granting greater rights to peasants and townspeople; of curbing the privileges of the mostly self-interested noble class; and of promoting a more active Polish role in international affairs, in the interest of stopping the depredations of Poland&#x27;s neighbors, Russia, Prussia, and Austria (who will in 1795 complete the dismemberment of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth). Romantic interest is provided by a rivalry between a reformer and a conservative for a young lady&#x27;s hand—which is won by the proponent of reforms.

==19th-century novel==
An early example of the political novel is &quot;The Betrothed&quot; (1827) by Alessandro Manzoni, an Italian historical novel. Set in northern Italy in 1628, during the oppressive years of direct Spanish rule, it has been seen sometimes as a veiled attack on the Austrian Empire, which controlled Italy at the time the novel was written. It has been called the most famous and widely read novel in the Italian language.

In the 1840s British politician Benjamin Disraeli wrote a trilogy of novels with political themes. With &quot;Coningsby; or, The New Generation&quot; (1844), Disraeli, in historian Robert Blake&#x27;s view, &quot;infused the novel genre with political sensibility, espousing the belief that England&#x27;s future as a world power depended not on the complacent old guard, but on youthful, idealistic politicians.&quot; &quot;Coningsby&quot; was followed by &quot;Sybil; or, The Two Nations&quot; (1845), another political novel, which was less idealistic and more clear-eyed than &quot;Coningsby&quot;; the &quot;two nations&quot; of its subtitle referred to the huge economic and social gap between the privileged few and the deprived working classes. The last of Disraeli&#x27;s political-novel trilogy, &quot;Tancred; or, The New Crusade&quot; (1847), promoted the Church of England&#x27;s role in reviving Britain&#x27;s flagging spirituality.

Ivan Turgenev wrote &quot;Fathers and Sons&quot; (1862) as a response to the growing cultural schism that he saw between Russia&#x27;s liberals of the 1830s and 1840s, and the growing Russian nihilist movement among their sons. Both the nihilists and the 1830s liberals sought Western-based social change in Russia. Additionally, these two modes of thought were contrasted with the Slavophiles, who believed that Russia&#x27;s path lay in its traditional spirituality. Turgenev&#x27;s novel was responsible for popularizing the use of the term &quot;nihilism&quot;, which became widely used after the novel was published.
The Polish writer Bolesław Prus&#x27; novel, &quot;Pharaoh&quot; (1895), is set in the Egypt of 1087–85 BCE as that country experiences internal stresses and external threats that will culminate in the fall of its Twentieth Dynasty and New Kingdom. The young protagonist Ramses learns that those who would challenge the powers that be are vulnerable to co-option, seduction, subornation, defamation, intimidation, and assassination. Perhaps the chief lesson, belatedly absorbed by Ramses as pharaoh, is the importance, to power, of knowledge. Prus&#x27; vision of the fall of an ancient civilization derives some of its power from the author&#x27;s intimate awareness of the final demise of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, a century before he completed &quot;Pharaoh&quot;. This is a political awareness that Prus shared with his 10-years-junior novelist compatriot, Joseph Conrad, who was an admirer of Prus&#x27; writings. &quot;Pharaoh&quot; has been translated into 23 languages and adapted as a 1966 Polish feature film. It is also known to have been Joseph Stalin&#x27;s favourite book.

==20th-century novel==
Joseph Conrad wrote several novels with political themes: &quot;Nostromo (1904)&quot;, &quot;The Secret Agent&quot; (1907), and
&quot;Under Western Eyes&quot; (1911). &quot;Nostromo&quot; (1904) is set amid political upheaval in the fictitious South American country of Costaguana, where a trusted Italian-descended longshoreman, Giovanni Battista Fidanza—the novel&#x27;s eponymous &quot;Nostromo&quot; (Italian for &quot;our man&quot;)—is instructed by English-descended silver-mine owner Charles Gould to take Gould&#x27;s silver abroad so that it will not fall into the hands of revolutionaries. The role of politics is paramount in &quot;The Secret Agent&quot;, as the main character, Verloc, works for a quasi-political organisation. The plot to destroy Greenwich Observatory is in itself anarchistic. Vladimir asserts that the bombing &quot;must be purely destructive&quot; and that the anarchists who will be implicated as the architects of the explosion &quot;should make it clear that [they] are perfectly determined to make a clean sweep of the whole social creation.&quot; However, the political form of anarchism is ultimately controlled in the novel: the only supposed politically motivated act is orchestrated by a secret government agency. Conrad&#x27;s third political novel, &quot;Under Western Eyes&quot;, is connected to Russian history. Its first audience read it against the backdrop of the failed Revolution of 1905 and in the shadow of the movements and impulses that would take shape as the revolutions of 1917. Conrad&#x27;s earlier novella, &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; (1899), also had political implications, in its depiction of European colonial depredations in Africa, which Conrad witnessed during his employ in the Belgian Congo.

John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; (1939) is a depiction of the plight of the poor. However, some Steinbeck&#x27;s contemporaries attacked his social and political views. Bryan Cordyack writes: &quot;Steinbeck was attacked as a propagandist and a socialist from both the left and the right of the political spectrum. The most fervent of these attacks came from the Associated Farmers of California; they were displeased with the book&#x27;s depiction of California farmers&#x27; attitudes and conduct toward the migrants. They denounced the book as a &#x27;pack of lies&#x27; and labeled it &#x27;communist propaganda&#x27;&quot;. Some accused Steinbeck of exaggerating camp conditions to make a political point. Steinbeck had visited the camps well before publication of the novel and argued that their inhumane nature destroyed the settlers&#x27; spirit.

&quot;The Quiet American&quot; (1955) by English novelist Graham Greene questions the foundations of growing American involvement in Vietnam in the 1950s. The novel has received much attention due to its prediction of the outcome of the Vietnam War and subsequent American foreign policy since the 1950s. Graham Greene portrays a U.S. official named Pyle as so blinded by American exceptionalism that he cannot see the calamities he brings upon the Vietnamese. The book uses Greene&#x27;s experiences as a war correspondent for &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;Le Figaro&quot; in French Indochina in 1951–54.

&quot;The Gay Place&quot; (1961) is a set of politically themed novellas with interlocking plots and characters by American author Billy Lee Brammer. Set in an unnamed state identical to Texas, each novella has a different protagonist: Roy Sherwood, a member of the state legislature; Neil Christiansen, the state&#x27;s junior senator; and Jay McGown, the governor&#x27;s speech-writer. The governor himself, Arthur Fenstemaker, a master politician (said to have been based on Brammer&#x27;s mentor Lyndon Johnson) serves as the dominant figure throughout. The book also includes characters based on Brammer, his wife Nadine,
Johnson&#x27;s wife Ladybird, and his brother Sam Houston Johnson. The book has been widely acclaimed one of the best American political novels ever written.

== 21st-century novel ==
Since 2000, there has been a surge of Transatlantic migrant literature in French, Spanish, and English, with new narratives about political topics relating to global debt, labor abuses, mass migration, and environmental crises in the Global South. Political fiction by contemporary novelists from the Caribbean, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Latin America directly challenges political leadership, systemic racism, and economical systems. Fatou Diome, a Senegalese immigrant living France since the 1990s, writes political fiction about her experiences on France&#x27;s unwelcoming borders that are dominated by white Christian culture. The work of Guadeloupean author Maryse Condé also tackles colonialism and oppression; her best known titles are &quot;Ségou&quot; (1984) and &quot;Ségou II&quot; (1985). Set in historical Segou (now part of Mali), the novels examine the violent legacies of the slave trade, Islam, Christianity, and colonization (from 1797 to 1860). A bold critic of the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy, French novelist Marie Ndiayes won the Prix Goncourt for &quot;Three Strong Women&quot;(2009) about patriarchal control.

==Proletarian novel==
The proletarian novel is written by workers, mainly for other workers. It overlaps and sometimes is synonymous with the working-class novel, socialist novel, social-problem novel (also problem novel, sociological novel, or social novel), propaganda or thesis novel, and socialist-realism novel. The intention of the writers of proletarian literature is to lift the workers from the slums by inspiring them to embrace the possibilities of social change or of a political revolution. As such, it is a form of political fiction.

The proletarian novel may comment on political events, systems, and theories, and is frequently seen as an instrument to promote social reform or political revolution among the working classes. Proletarian literature is created especially by communist, socialist, and anarchist authors. It is about the lives of the poor, and the period from 1930 to 1945, in particular, produced many such novels. However, proletarian works were also produced before and after those dates. In Britain, the terms &quot;working-class&quot; literature, novel, etc., are more generally used.

==Social novel==
A closely related type of novel, which frequently has a political dimension, is the social novel – also known as the &quot;social-problem&quot; or &quot;social-protest&quot; novel – a &quot;work of fiction in which a prevailing social problem, such as gender, race, or class prejudice, is dramatized through its effect on the characters of a novel&quot;. More specific examples of social problems that are addressed in such works include poverty, conditions in factories and mines, the plight of child labor, violence against women, rising criminality, and epidemics caused by overcrowding and poor sanitation in cities.

Charles Dickens was a fierce critic of the poverty and social stratification of Victorian society. Karl Marx asserted that Dickens &quot;issued to the world more political and social truths than have been uttered by all the professional politicians, publicists and moralists put together&quot;. On the other hand, George Orwell, in his essay on Dickens, wrote: &quot;There is no clear sign that he wants the existing order to be overthrown, or that he believes it would make very much difference if it were overthrown. For in reality his target is not so much society as &#x27;human nature&#x27;.&quot;

Dickens&#x27;s second novel, &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1839), shocked readers with its images of poverty and crime: it destroyed middle-class polemics about criminals, making any pretence to ignorance about what poverty entailed impossible. Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854) is set in a small Midlands industrial town and particularly criticizes the effect of Utilitarianism on the lives of cities&#x27; working classes. John Ruskin declared &quot;Hard Times&quot; his favourite Dickens work due to its exploration of important social questions. Walter Allen characterised &quot;Hard Times&quot; as an unsurpassed &quot;critique of industrial society&quot;,

<text>A potato chip (NAmE and AuE; often just chip) or crisp (BrE and IrE) is a thin slice of potato (or a thin deposit of potato paste) that has been deep fried, baked, or air fried until crunchy. They are commonly served as a snack, side dish, or appetizer. The basic chips are cooked and salted; additional varieties are manufactured using various flavorings and ingredients including herbs, spices, cheeses, other natural flavors, artificial flavours, and additives.

Potato chips form a large part of the snack food and convenience food market in Western countries. The global potato chip market generated total revenue of US$16.49 billion in 2005. This accounted for 35.5% of the total savory snacks market in that year (which was $46.1 billion overall).

== History ==

The earliest known recipe for potato chips is in the English cook William Kitchiner&#x27;s book &quot;The Cook&#x27;s Oracle&quot; published in 1817, which was a bestseller in the United Kingdom and the United States. The 1822 edition&#x27;s recipe for &quot;Potatoes fried in Slices or Shavings&quot; reads &quot;peel large potatoes... cut them in shavings round and round, as you would peel a lemon; dry them well in a clean cloth, and fry them in lard or dripping&quot;. An 1825 British book about French cookery calls them &quot;Pommes de Terre frites&quot; (second recipe) and calls for thin slices of potato fried in &quot;clarified butter or goose dripping&quot;, drained and sprinkled with salt. Early recipes for potato chips in the US are found in Mary Randolph&#x27;s &quot;Virginia House-Wife&quot; (1824) and in N.K.M. Lee&#x27;s &quot;Cook&#x27;s Own Book&quot; (1832), both of which explicitly cite Kitchiner.

A legend associates the creation of potato chips with Saratoga Springs, New York, decades later than the first recorded recipe. By the late nineteenth century, a popular version of the story attributed the dish to George Crum, a cook at Moon&#x27;s Lake House who was trying to appease an unhappy customer on August 24, 1853. The customer kept sending back his French-fried potatoes, complaining that they were too thick, too &quot;soggy&quot;, or not salted enough. Frustrated, Crum sliced several potatoes extremely thin, fried them to a crisp, and seasoned them with extra salt. To his surprise, the customer loved them. They soon came to be called &quot;Saratoga Chips&quot;, a name that persisted into the mid-twentieth century. A version of this story was popularized in a 1973 national advertising campaign by St. Regis Paper Company which manufactured packaging for chips, claiming that Crum&#x27;s customer was Cornelius Vanderbilt. Crum was already renowned as a chef at the time, and he owned a lakeside restaurant by 1860 which he called Crum&#x27;s House. The &quot;Saratoga Chips&quot; brand name still exists today.

== Production ==

In the 20th century, potato chips spread beyond chef-cooked restaurant fare and began to be mass-produced for home consumption. The Dayton, Ohio-based Mikesell&#x27;s Potato Chip Company, founded in 1910, identifies as the &quot;oldest potato chip company in the United States&quot;. New Hampshire-based Granite State Potato Chip Factory, founded in 1905 and in operation until 2007, was one of America&#x27;s first potato chip manufacturers.

=== Flavoring ===
In an idea originated by the Smiths Potato Crisps Company Ltd, formed in 1920, Frank Smith packaged his chips in greaseproof paper bags and attached a twist of salt, and sold them around London. The potato chip remained otherwise unseasoned until the 1950s. After some trial and error, in 1954, Joe &quot;Spud&quot; Murphy, the owner of the Irish crisps company Tayto, and his employee Seamus Burke, produced the world&#x27;s first seasoned chips: cheese &amp; onion. Companies worldwide sought to buy the rights to Tayto&#x27;s technique. Walkers of Leicester, England produced cheese &amp; onion the same year. Golden Wonder (Smith&#x27;s main competitor at the time) also started to produce cheese &amp; onion, and Smith&#x27;s countered with salt &amp; vinegar (tested first by their north-east England subsidiary Tudor and then launched nationally in 1967), starting a two-decade-long flavor war.

The first flavored chips in the United States, barbecue flavor, were being manufactured and sold by 1954. In 1958, Herr&#x27;s was the first company to introduce barbecue-flavored potato chips in Pennsylvania.

=== Packaging ===

Chips sold in markets were usually sold in tins or scooped out of storefront glass bins and delivered by horse and wagon. Early potato chip bags were wax paper with the ends ironed or stapled together. At first, potato chips were packaged in barrels or tins, which left chips at the bottom stale and crumbled.

In the 1920s, Laura Scudder, an entrepreneur in Monterey Park, California, started having her workers take home sheets of wax paper to iron into the form of bags, which were filled with chips at her factory the next day. This pioneering method reduced crumbling and kept the chips fresh and crisp longer. This innovation, along with the invention of cellophane, allowed potato chips to become a mass-market product. Today, chips are packaged in plastic bags, with nitrogen gas blown in prior to sealing to lengthen shelf life, and provide protection against crushing.

=== Kettle-cooked chips ===


Chips were long made in a batch process, where the potato slices are rinsed with cold water to release starch, fried at a low temperature of , and continuously raked to prevent them from sticking together.

Industrial advances resulted in a shift to production by a continuous process, running the chips through a vat of hot oil and drying them in a conveyor process.

Some small producers continued to use a batch process, notably in Maui. In 1980, inspired by the Maui Chip, an entrepreneur started Cape Cod Potato Chips to produce thicker, batch-cooked &quot;Hawaiian style&quot; potato chips, which came to be known as kettle-style (US) or hand-cooked (UK) chips and became a premium, &quot;gourmet&quot; item. Kettle chips are thicker and the surface starch is not rinsed off, resulting in a style of chip called &quot;hard-bite&quot;.

== Nomenclature ==

Little consistency exists in the English-speaking world for the name of this food. North American English uses &quot;chips&quot;, though Canadians may also call French fries, especially thick ones, &quot;chips&quot; as well. &quot;Crisps&quot; may be used for thin fried or baked products made from potato paste. An example of this type of snack is Pringles, which are marketed as &quot;potato crisps&quot; even in the United States.

In the United Kingdom and Ireland they are called &quot;crisps&quot;, whilst &quot;chips&quot; refers to french fries (as in &quot;fish and chips&quot;). In Australia, some parts of South Africa, New Zealand, India, and the West Indies, especially in Barbados, both forms of potato product are simply known as &quot;chips&quot;, as are the larger &quot;home-style&quot; variety. In the north of New Zealand, they are sometimes affectionately known as &quot;chippies&quot;; however, they are marketed as &quot;chips&quot; throughout the country. In Australia and New Zealand, a distinction is sometimes made between &quot;hot chips&quot; (fried potatoes) and &quot;chips&quot; or &quot;potato chips&quot;. In Bangladesh, they are generally known as &quot;chip&quot; or &quot;chips&quot;, and much less frequently as &quot;crisps&quot; (pronounced &quot;kirisp&quot;) and locally, &quot;alu bhaja&quot;.

In German-speaking countries (Austria, Germany: &quot;Kartoffelchips&quot;, often shortened to &quot;Chips&quot;; Switzerland: &quot;Pommes Chips&quot;) and in countries of the former Yugoslavia, fried thin potato slices are known as &quot;chips&quot; (locally pronounced very similarly to the English pronunciation), with a clear distinction from French fries. In Brazil, &quot;home-style&quot; potato chips are known as (&quot;Portuguese potatoes&quot;) if their sides are relatively smooth and (&quot;Prussian potatoes&quot;) if their sides show a wafer biscuit-like pattern, whilst American-like industrial uniform potato chips made from a fried potato purée-based dough are known as &quot;batata chips&quot; (&quot;potato chips&quot;), or just &quot;chips&quot;.

== Health concerns ==

Most potato chips contain high levels of sodium, from salt. This has been linked to health issues such as high blood pressure. However, researchers at Queen Mary University of London in 2004 have noted that a small &quot;bag of ready-salted crisps&quot; contains less salt than a serving of many breakfast cereals, including &quot;every brand of cornflakes on sale in the UK&quot;.

Some potato chip companies have responded to the long-standing concerns by investing in research and development to modify existing recipes and create health-conscious products. PepsiCo research shows that about 80% of salt on chips is not sensed by the tongue before being swallowed. Frito-Lay spent $414 million in 2009 on product development, including development of salt crystals that would reduce the salt content of Lay&#x27;s potato chips without adversely affecting flavor.

Unsalted chips are available, e.g. the longstanding British brand Salt &#x27;n&#x27; Shake, whose chips are not seasoned but instead include a small salt sachet in the bag for seasoning to taste. Many other popular brands in the United States, such as Frito-Lay, also offer such a product.

One health scare related to potato chips focused on acrylamide, which is produced when potatoes are fried or baked at high temperatures. This discovery in 2002 led to international health concerns. Subsequent research has however found that it is not likely that the acrylamides in burnt or well-cooked food cause cancer in humans; Cancer Research UK categorizes the idea that burnt food causes cancer as a &quot;myth&quot;.

In August 2008, California Attorney General Jerry Brown announced a settlement with Frito-Lay, Kettle Foods, and Lance Inc., the makers of Cape Cod Potato Chips, for violating the state&#x27;s Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act. The state had alleged in 2005 that potato chips from these companies failed to document that they contained high levels of acrylamide, which is listed by California since the 1990s as a carcinogen. These companies paid fines and agreed to reduce acrylamide levels to be under 275 parts per billion. Many potato chip manufacturers attempt to remove burned and thus potentially acrylamide-rich chips before the packaging process. Large scanners are used to eliminate chips worst affected by heat.

== Regional varieties ==
=== Americas ===
In the United States, major regional brands include Jays, Better Made, Old Dutch, Utz and Zapp&#x27;s. 

In Canada, regional varieties include all-dressed, dill pickle, and ketchup. Ketchup chips are flavored with tomato, garlic and onions.

In Colombia, lemon, chicken, chorizo, and sirloin steak with mushroom sauce flavored potato chips are sold.

=== Europe ===
In the United Kingdom, Walkers makes crisps with popular flavours as Prawn Cocktail, Beef and Onion, Roast Chicken, Smoky Bacon, Worcester Sauce, Pickled Onion, and Tomato Ketchup, and exotic flavors Thai sweet chili, roast pork and creamy mustard sauce, chicken with Italian herbs, Spicy Sriracha, BBQ Pulled Pork, sea salt and cider vinegar, spicy and aromatic curry, turkey and bacon, caramelized onion and sweet balsamic vinegar, Stilton and cranberry. In Ireland, the word &quot;Tayto&quot; is synonymous with potato chips after the Tayto brand, and can be used to describe all varieties of chips, including those not produced by Tayto. Hunky Dorys and King are other popular Irish brands.

In Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, salted and sweet paprika chips (sometimes also called &quot;ungarisch&quot; (from &quot;Hungarian&quot;) in Germany) are the two most common and popular types. In Germany, chip producers have introduced additional flavours, such as sour cream and onion, cheese, oriental, or more exotic seasonings like &quot;Chakalaka&quot;, &quot;Currywurst&quot;, &quot;Pommes&quot; (french fries), and &quot;Rot-weiss&quot; (red and white: french fries with tomato ketchup and mayonnaise). In Belgium and the Netherlands, &quot;Bolognese&quot; flavoured potato chips are also popular; this flavour was introduced by Belgian chip company Croky.

In Russia, the Russkaya Kartoshka brand of chips claim reduced content of oil in their curled (C-shaped, nearly ball-shaped) chips, and offers flavors like grilled salmon, shrimp and &quot;Kamchatka&#x27;s crab&quot;, that are unique seafood-themed flavors of potato chips mass-produced in Russia. Lay&#x27;s offers crab-flavored and no-cream green onion flavored chips as ones made uniquely for Russian market. Lay&#x27;s &quot;Iz pechi&quot; (literally &quot;from the stove&quot;) line of less-oiled chips also include crab flavor. &quot;Just Brutal&quot; brand has pitch-black chips, where the flavors are &quot;vinegar&quot; and &quot;Thai sweet pepper&quot;.

=== Asia ===


In Japan, flavors include norishio (nori and salt), &quot;consommé&quot;, wasabi, soy sauce and butter, garlic, plum, barbecue, pizza, mayonnaise, and black pepper. Chili, scallop with butter, teriyaki, takoyaki, and yakitori chip flavors are also available. Major manufacturers include Calbee and Koikeya. In Hong Kong, the two prominent potato chips are the spicy &quot;Ethnican&quot; variety by Calbee, and barbecue by Jack &#x27;n Jill.

In Indonesia, potato chips are commonly called &quot;kripik kentang&quot; and traditionally fell under the &quot;kripik&quot; category. The major brands are Indofood&#x27;s Chitato (since 1990s) and Lay&#x27;s (Frito-Lay). In 2014, Japan&#x27;s Calbee and Indonesia&#x27;s Wings Food formed Calbeewings, a joint venture and marketed Potabee potato chips offering two flavors: beef BBQ and grilled seaweed. Lay&#x27;s potato chips sold in Indonesia are available in six flavors: honey butter, sour cream and onion, nori seaweed, beef barbecue, classic salty, and salmon teriyaki flavors. In 2018 Chitato launched three unusual flavors: beef rendang, fried crab golden egg yolk, and mango sticky rice.

== Similar foods ==

Another food made from potatoes, notably the Pringles and Lay&#x27;s Stax brands, is made by extruding or pressing a dough made from dehydrated potato flour into the desired shape before frying. This makes a product that is uniform in size and shape, which allows them to be stacked and packaged in rigid cardboard or plastic canisters. Pringles are officially branded as &quot;potato crisps&quot; in the US. Pringles may be termed &quot;potato chips&quot; in Britain, to distinguish them from traditional &quot;crisps&quot;, but do not meet the definition or standard of identity for potato chips. Munchos, another brand that uses the term &quot;potato crisps&quot;, has deep air pockets in its chips that give it a curved shape, though the chips themselves resemble regular bagged chips.

An additional product similar to potato chips exists in the form of &quot;potato sticks&quot;, also called &quot;shoestring potatoes&quot;. These are made as extremely thin (2 to 3 mm) versions of the popular French fry but are fried in the manner of regular salted potato chips. A hickory-smoke-flavored version is popular in Canada, going by the vending machine name &quot;Hickory Sticks&quot;. Potato sticks are typically packaged in rigid containers, although some manufacturers use flexible pouches, similar to potato chip bags. Potato sticks were originally packed in hermetically sealed steel cans. In the 1960s, manufacturers switched to the less expensive composite canister (similar to the Pringles container). Reckitt Benckiser was a market leader in this category under the Durkee Potato Stix and French&#x27;s Potato Sticks names but exited the business in 2008. In 2014, French&#x27;s reentered the market. A larger variant (about 1 cm thick) made with dehydrated potatoes is marketed as Andy Capp&#x27;s Pub Fries, using the theme of a long-running British comic strip, which are baked and sold in a variety of flavors. Walkers make a similar product (using the Smiths brand) called &quot;Chipsticks&quot; which are sold in ready-salted and salt and vinegar flavors.

Some companies have also marketed baked potato chips as an alternative with lower fat content. Additionally, some varieties of fat-free chips have been made using artificial, and indigestible, fat substitutes. These became well known in the media when an ingredient many contained, Olestra, was linked in some individuals to abdominal discomfort and loose stools.
Many other products might be called &quot;crisps&quot; in Britain, but would not be classed as &quot;potato chips&quot; because they are not made with potato or are not chipped (for example, Wotsits, Quavers, Skips, Hula Hoops, and Monster Munch). British restaurant critic Tanya Gold argues that Monster Munch &quot;is absolutely not a crisp&quot;.

Sweet potato chips are eaten in Korea, New Zealand, and Japan; parsnip, beetroot, and carrot crisps are available in the United Kingdom. India is famous for a large number of localized &#x27;chips shops&#x27;, selling not only potato chips, but also other varieties such as plantain chips, tapioca chips, yam chips, and even carrot chips. Plantain chips, also known as chifles or tostones, are also sold in the Western Hemisphere from Canada to Chile. In the Philippines, banana chips can be found sold at local stores. In Kenya, chips are made from arrowroot and cassava. In the United Kingdom, Sweden, Finland, and Australia, a new variety of Pringles made from rice has been released and marketed as lower in fat than its potato counterparts.

<doc id="24856" wikidata="Q46388" url="?curid=24856" title="Prohibition">
<text>Prohibition is the act or practice of forbidding something by law; more particularly the term refers to the banning of the manufacture, storage (whether in barrels or in bottles), transportation, sale, possession, and consumption of alcoholic beverages. The word is also used to refer to a period of time during which such bans are enforced.

==History==

Some kind of limitation on the trade in alcohol can be seen in the Code of Hammurabi () specifically banning the selling of beer for money. It could only be bartered for barley: &quot;If a beer seller do not receive barley as the price for beer, but if she receive money or make the beer a measure smaller than the barley measure received, they shall throw her into the water.&quot;

In the early twentieth century, much of the impetus for the prohibition movement in the Nordic countries and North America came from moralistic convictions of pietistic Protestants. Prohibition movements in the West coincided with the advent of women&#x27;s suffrage, with newly empowered women as part of the political process strongly supporting policies that curbed alcohol consumption.

The first half of the 20th century saw periods of prohibition of alcoholic beverages in several countries:
* 1918 to 1920: Prohibition in Canada nationally, as well as in most provinces including:
**1901 to 1948 in Prince Edward Island
** 1919 to 1919 in Quebec
* 1907 to 1992 in the Faroe Islands; limited private imports from Denmark were allowed from 1928
* 1914 to 1925: Prohibition in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union
* 1915 to 1935: Prohibition in Iceland (wine legal from 1922, but beer still prohibited until 1989)
* 1916 to 1927 in Norway (fortified wine and beer were also prohibited from 1917 to 1923) 
* 1919 in the Hungarian Soviet Republic, March 21 to August 1; called &quot;szesztilalom&quot;
* 1919 to 1932 in Finland (called &quot;kieltolaki&quot;, &quot;ban law&quot;)
* 1920 to 1933: Prohibition in the United States

After several years, prohibition failed in North America and elsewhere. Rum-running or bootlegging became widespread, and organized crime took control of the distribution of alcohol. Distilleries and breweries in Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean flourished as their products were either consumed by visiting Americans or illegally exported to the United States. Detroit and Chicago became notorious as havens for prohibition dodgers during the time known as the Roaring Twenties – 75% of all alcohol smuggled into the United States crossed the Detroit-Windsor border. Prohibition generally came to an end in the late 1920s or early 1930s in most of North America and Europe, although a few locations continued prohibition for many more years.

In some countries where the dominant religion forbids the use of alcohol, the production, sale, and consumption of alcoholic beverages is prohibited or restricted today. For example, in Saudi Arabia and Libya alcohol is banned; in Pakistan and Iran it is illegal with exceptions.

== Effects ==
Generally, prohibition is not completely effective, and tends to drive the market underground instead. Most countries which have maintained long-standing alcohol bans have predominantly Muslim populations whose religious beliefs forbid them from drinking, but the broad popularity of alcohol has meant prohibition is extremely difficult to enforce in most nations. The vast majority of countries which have at one point fully prohibited alcohol have since reversed it. Both the United States and Soviet Union implemented total bans on alcohol only to repeal them after less than 15 years. 

==Prohibition worldwide==

===Africa===
====Nigeria====
In the British colony of Nigeria, missionary forces demanded prohibition of liquor, which proved highly unpopular. Both Africans and British found illegal supplies such as secret stills, obtaining colonial liquor permits, and smuggling. The experiment began in 1890 and was repealed in 1939.

====South Africa====
During the coronavirus outbreak of 2020, alcohol sales, and even the transportation of alcohol outside of one&#x27;s home, was made illegal. This order came into effect during the nationwide lockdown on 27 March 2020. The purpose of the ban was intended to prevent drunken fights, reduce domestic violence, stop drunk driving, and eliminate the weekend binge-drinking so prevalent across South Africa.

Police, medics, and analysts estimate—conservatively—that alcohol is involved in, or responsible for, at least 40% of all emergency hospital admissions. By reducing the number of people within hospitals, and of course within social gatherings, the goal of prohibition was to reduce the rate of transmission, and thus slow the spread of the virus.

A 2022 study found that the alcohol prohibition reduced injury-induced mortality by at least 14% (a conservative estimate) and sharply reduced violent crime.

===South Asia===
====Afghanistan====
Sale of alcohol is banned in Afghanistan.

====Bangladesh====
In Bangladesh, alcohol is somewhat prohibited due to its proscription in the Islamic faith. The purchase and consumption is still allowed in the country. The Garo tribe consume a type of rice beer, and Christians in this country drink and purchase wine for their holy communion.

====India====

In India alcohol is a state subject and individual states can legislate prohibition, but currently most states do not have prohibition and sale/consumption is freely available in 24 out of 29 states. Prohibition is in force in the states of Mizoram, Gujarat, Bihar and Nagaland, parts of Manipur, and the union territory of Lakshadweep. All other States and union territories of India permit the sale of alcohol.

Election days and certain national holidays such as &quot;Independence Day&quot; are meant to be &quot;dry days&quot; when liquor sale is not permitted but consumption is allowed. Some Indian states observe dry days on major religious festivals/occasions depending on the popularity of the festival in that region.

====Maldives====
The Maldives ban the import of alcohol, x-raying all baggage on arrival. Alcoholic beverages are available only to foreign tourists on resort islands and may not be taken off the resort.

====Pakistan====

Pakistan allowed the free sale and consumption of alcohol for three decades from 1947, but restrictions were introduced by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto just weeks before he was removed as prime minister in 1977. Since then, only members of non-Muslim minorities such as Hindus, Christians and Zoroastrians are allowed to apply for alcohol permits. The monthly quota is dependent upon one&#x27;s income, but is actually about five bottles of liquor or 100 bottles of beer. In a country of 180 million, only about 60 outlets are allowed to sell alcohol. The Murree Brewery in Rawalpindi was once the only legal brewery, but today there are more. The ban officially is enforced by the country&#x27;s Islamic Ideology Council, but it is not strictly policed. Members of religious minorities, however, often sell their liquor permits to Muslims as part of a continuing black market trade in alcohol.

====Sri Lanka====
In 1955 Sri Lanka passed a law prohibiting adult women from buying alcohol. In January 2018, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera announced that the law would be amended, allowing women to legally consume alcohol and work in venues that sell alcohol. The legalization was overruled by President Maithripala Sirisena several days later.

===West Asia===
====Iran====
Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Muslims are banned from selling and drinking alcohol but some people trade and sell it illegally. Home production by religious minorities (Zoroastrians, Jews, and Christians) is legal.

====Kuwait====
The consumption, importation and brewing of, and trafficking in liquor is strictly against the law.

====Saudi Arabia====
The sale, consumption, importation and brewing of, and trafficking in liquor is strictly against the law.

====Yemen====
Alcohol is banned in Yemen.

===Southeast Asia===
==== Brunei ====
In Brunei, alcohol consumption and sale is banned in public. Non-Muslims are allowed to purchase a limited amount of alcohol from their point of embarcation overseas for their own private consumption, and non-Muslims who are at least the age of 18 are allowed to bring in not more than two bottles of liquor (about two litres) and twelve cans of beer per person into the country.

==== Indonesia ====
Alcohol sales are banned in small shops and convenience stores.

==== Korea ====
During the Joseon period, laws prohibiting the drinking of alcohol were frequently promulgated when there were major droughts, crop failures, or famines. The purpose of such bans was to appease the wrath of heaven, and to save food and money (since rice was used to make alcohol). A ban was issued almost every year during King Taejong&#x27;s reign and frequently during the reigns of King Seongjong and King Yeonsangun. It was banned again, in 1758 (the 34th year of King Yeongjo). The bans usually occurred during spring and summer when the droughts were severe.

====Malaysia====
Alcohol is banned only for Muslims in Malaysia due to its Islamic faith and sharia law. Nevertheless, alcoholic products can easily be found in supermarkets, specialty shops, and convenience stores all over the country. Non-halal restaurants also typically sell alcohol.

====Philippines====
There are only restrictions during elections in the Philippines. Alcohol is prohibited to be sold, furnished, offered, bought, or took two days prior to an election. Hotels and restaurants may secure a prior exemption but even then they are only allowed to serve alcohol to non-Filipino citizens. Private consumption of alcohol hoarded prior to the ban period is tolerated. The Philippine Commission on Elections may opt to extend the liquor ban. In the 2013 elections, there was a proposal that it be extended to five days. This was overturned by the Supreme Court.

Other than election-related prohibition, alcohol is freely sold to anyone above the legal drinking age.

====Thailand====
Alcohol sales are prohibited during elections from 18:00 the day prior to voting, until the end of the day of voting itself. Alcohol is also prohibited on major Buddhist holy days, and sometimes on royal commemoration days, such as birthdays.

Thailand also enforces time-limited bans on alcohol on a daily basis. Alcohol can only be legally purchased in stores or restaurants between 11:00–14:00 and 17:00–midnight. The law is enforced by all major retailers (most notably 7-Eleven) and restaurants, but is frequently ignored by the smaller &quot;mom and pop&quot; stores. Hotels and resorts are exempt from the rules.

The consumption of alcohol is also banned at any time within 200 meters of a filling station (where sale of alcohol is also illegal), schools, temples or hospitals as well as on board any type of road vehicle regardless of whether it is being consumed by the driver or passenger.

At certain times of the year—Thai New Year (Songkran) is an example—the government may also enforce arbitrary bans on the sale and consumption of alcohol in specific public areas where large scale festivities are due to take place and large crowds are expected.

Thailand strictly regulates alcohol advertising, as specified in the Alcoholic Beverage Control Act, B.E. 2551 (2008) (ABCA). Sales of alcohol via &quot;electronic channels&quot; (internet) are prohibited.

===Europe===
====Czech Republic====

On 14 September 2012, the Government of the Czech Republic banned all sales of alcoholic drinks with more than 20% alcohol. From this date, it was illegal to sell such alcoholic beverages in shops, supermarkets, bars, restaurants, filling stations, e-shops, etc. This measure was taken in response to the wave of methanol poisoning cases resulting in the deaths of 18 people in the Czech Republic. Since the beginning of the &quot;methanol affair&quot; the total number of deaths has increased to 25. The ban was to be valid until further notice, though restrictions were eased towards the end of September. The last bans on Czech alcohol with regard to the poisoning cases were lifted on 10 October 2012, when neighbouring Slovakia and Poland allowed its import once again.

====Nordic countries====
The Nordic countries, with the exception of Denmark, have had a strong temperance movement since the late-1800s, closely linked to the Christian revival movement of the late-nineteenth century, but also to several worker organisations. As an example, in 1910 the temperance organisations in Sweden had some 330,000 members, which was about 6% of a population of 5.5 million. This heavily influenced the decisions of Nordic politicians in the early 20th century.

In 1907, the Faroe Islands passed a law prohibiting all sale of alcohol, which was in force until 1992. Very restricted private importation from Denmark was allowed from 1928 onwards.

In 1914, Sweden put in place a rationing system, the Bratt System, in force until 1955. A referendum in 1922 rejected an attempt to enforce total prohibition.

In 1915, Iceland instituted total prohibition. The ban for wine was lifted in 1922 and spirits in 1935, but beer remained prohibited until 1989 (circumvented by mixing light beer and spirits).

In 1916, Norway prohibited distilled beverages, and in 1917 the prohibition was extended to also include fortified wine and beer. The wine and beer ban was lifted in 1923, and in 1927 the ban of distilled beverages was also lifted.
In 1919, Finland enacted prohibition, as one of the first acts after independence from the Russian Empire. Four previous attempts to institute prohibition in the early twentieth century had failed due to opposition from the tsar. After a development similar to the one in the United States during its prohibition, with large-scale smuggling and increasing violence and crime rates, public opinion turned against the prohibition, and after a national referendum where 70% voted for a repeal of the law, prohibition was abolished in early 1932.

Today, all Nordic countries except Denmark continue to have strict controls on the sale of alcohol, which is highly taxed (dutied) to the public. There are government monopolies in place for selling spirits, wine, and stronger beers in Norway (Vinmonopolet), Finland (Alko), Sweden (), Iceland (Vínbúðin), and the Faroe Islands (Rúsdrekkasøla Landsins). Bars and restaurants may, however, import alcoholic beverages directly or through other companies.
Greenland, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, does not share its easier controls on the sale of alcohol. Greenland has (like Denmark) sales in food shops, but prices are typically high. Private import when travelling from Denmark is only allowed in small quantities.

====Russian Empire and the Soviet Union====

In the Russian Empire, a limited version of a Dry Law was introduced in 1914. It continued through the turmoil of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Russian Civil War into the period of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union until 1925.

====United Kingdom====
Although the sale or consumption of commercial alcohol has never been prohibited by law in the United Kingdom, various groups in the UK have campaigned for the prohibition of alcohol; including the Society of Friends (Quakers), The Methodist Church and other non-conformists, as well as temperance movements such as Band of Hope and temperance Chartist movements of the nineteenth century. The village of Bournville traditionally remains a dry town with no pubs due to the founder John Cadbury&#x27;s Quaker beliefs and wish for it to remain free of alcohol for the workers at his Cadbury&#x27;s chocolate factory.

Formed in 1853 and inspired by the Maine law in the United States, the United Kingdom Alliance aimed at promoting a similar law prohibiting the sale of alcohol in the UK. This hard-line group of prohibitionists was opposed by other temperance organisations who preferred moral persuasion to a legal ban. This division in the ranks limited the effectiveness of the temperance movement as a whole. The impotence of legislation in this field was demonstrated when the Sale of Beer Act 1854, which restricted Sunday opening hours, had to be repealed, following widespread rioting. In 1859, a prototype prohibition bill was overwhelmingly defeated in the House of Commons.

On 22 March 1917, during the First World War at a crowded meeting in the Queen&#x27;s Hall in London (chaired by Alfred Booth) many influential people including Agnes Weston spoke, or letters from them were read out, against alcohol consumption, calling for prohibition; General Sir Reginald Hart wrote to the meeting that &quot;Every experienced officer knew that practically all unhappiness and crime in the Army is due to drink&quot;. At the meeting, Lord Channing said that it was a pity that the whole Cabinet did not follow the example of King George V and Lord Kitchener when in 1914 those two spoke calling for complete prohibition for the duration of the war.

Edwin Scrymgeour served as Member of Parliament for Dundee between 15 November 1922 and 8 October 1931. He remains the only person to have ever been elected to the House of Commons on a prohibitionist ticket. In 1922, he defeated incumbent Liberal member Winston Churchill; winning the seat for the 
Scottish Prohibition Party, which he had founded in 1901, and for which he had stood for election successfully as a Dundee Burgh Councillor in 1905 and unsuccessfully as a parliamentary candidate between 1908 and 1922.

===North America===
====Canada====
Indigenous peoples in Canada were subject to prohibitory alcohol laws under the &quot;Indian Act&quot; of 1876. Sections of the &quot;Indian Act&quot; regarding liquor were not repealed for over a hundred years, until 1985.

An official, but non-binding, federal referendum on prohibition was held in 1898. Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier&#x27;s government chose not to introduce a federal bill on prohibition, mindful of the strong antipathy in Quebec. As a result, Canadian prohibition was instead enacted through laws passed by the provinces during the first twenty years of the 20th century, especially during the 1910s. Canada did, however, enact a national prohibition from 1918 to 1920 as a temporary wartime measure. Much of the rum-running during prohibition took place in Windsor, Ontario. The provinces later repealed their prohibition laws, mostly during the 1920s, although some local municipalities remain dry.

====Mexico====
Some communities in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas of are under the control of the libertarian socialist Zapatista Army of National Liberation, and often ban alcohol as part of what was described as &quot;a collective decision&quot;. This prohibition has been used by many villages as a way to decrease domestic violence and has generally been favored by women. This prohibition, however, is not recognized by federal Mexican law as the Zapatista movement is strongly opposed by the federal government.

The sale and purchase of alcohol is prohibited on and the night before certain national holidays, such as &quot;Natalicio de Benito Juárez&quot; (birthdate of Benito Juárez) and &quot;Día de la Revolución&quot;, which are meant to be dry nationally. The same &quot;dry law&quot; applies to the days before presidential elections every six years.

====United States====
Prohibition in the United States focused on the manufacture, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages; exceptions were made for medicinal and religious uses. Alcohol consumption was never illegal under federal law. Nationwide Prohibition did not begin in the United States until January 1920, when the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution went into effect. The Eighteenth amendment was ratified in 1919, and was repealed in December 1933 with the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment.

Concern over excessive alcohol consumption began during the American colonial era, when fines were imposed for drunken behavior and for selling liquor without a license. In the mid-19th century evangelical Protestants denounced drinking as sinful and demanded the prohibition of the sale of beer, wine and liquor. Apart from Maine, they had limited success until the early 20th century. By the 1840s the temperance movement was actively encouraging individuals to immediately stop drinking. However, the issue of slavery, and then the Civil War, overshadowed the temperance movement until the 1870s.

Prohibition was a major reform movement from the 1870s until the 1920s, when nationwide prohibition went into effect. It was supported by evangelical Protestant churches, especially the Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians, Disciples of Christ, Congregationalists, Quakers, and Scandinavian Lutherans. Opposition came from Catholics, Episcopalians, and German Lutherans. The Women&#x27;s Crusade of 1873 and the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), founded in 1874, were means through which certain women organized and demanded political action, well before they were granted the vote. The WCTU and the Prohibition Party were major players until the 20th century, when the Anti-Saloon League emerged as the movement&#x27;s leader. By 1913, 9 states had statewide prohibition and 31 others had local option laws in effect. The League then turned their efforts toward attaining a constitutional amendment and grassroots support for nationwide prohibition. The German American community was the base of the beer industry and became a pariah when the U.S. declared war on Germany in 1917. A new constitutional amendment passed Congress in December 1917 and was ratified by the states in 1919. It prohibited &quot;the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof.&quot; On October 28, 1919, Congress passed the National Prohibition Act, known as the Volstead Act, to implement the new 18th Amendment. After a year&#x27;s required delay, national prohibition began on January 16, 1920.
Initially, alcohol consumption nosedived to about 30% of its pre-Prohibition levels, but within a few years, the illicit market grew to roughly two-thirds. Illegal stills flourished in remote rural areas as well as city slums, and large quantities were smuggled from Canada. Bootlegging became a major business activity for organized crime groups, under leaders such as Al Capone in Chicago and Lucky Luciano in New York City.

Prohibition lost support during the Great Depression, from 1929. The repeal movement was initiated and financed by the Association Against the Prohibition Amendment, and Pauline Sabin, a wealthy Republican, founded the Women&#x27;s Organization for National Prohibition Reform (WONPR). Repeal of Prohibition in the United States was accomplished with the ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment on December 5, 1933. Under its terms, states were allowed to set their own laws for the control of alcohol, although it remains a heavily regulated commodity at the federal level as well, e.g., with federally established standards of identity for alcoholic beverages, federal licensing of distilleries, federal taxation, and a federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives enforcement agency.

Between 1832 and 1953, federal legislation prohibited the sale of alcohol to Native Americans, with very limited success. After 1953, Native American communities and reservations were permitted to pass their own local ordinances governing the sale of alcoholic beverages.

In the 21st century, there are still counties and parishes within the United States known as &quot;dry&quot;, where the sale of alcohol is prohibited or restricted.

===South America===
====Venezuela====
In Venezuela, twenty-four hours before every election, the government prohibits the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages throughout the national territory, including the restriction to all dealers, liquor stores, supermarkets, restaurants, wineries, pubs, bars, public entertainment, clubs and any establishment that markets alcoholic beverages.

The same is done during Holy Week as a measure to reduce the alarming rate of road traffic accidents during these holidays.

===Oceania===
====Australia====
The Australian Capital Territory (then the Federal Capital Territory) was the first jurisdiction in Australia to have prohibition laws. In 1911, King O&#x27;Malley, then Minister of Home Affairs, shepherded laws through Parliament preventing new issue or transfer of licences to sell alcohol, to address unruly behaviour among workers building the new capital city. Prohibition was partial, since possession of alcohol purchased outside of the Territory remained legal and the few pubs that had existing licences could continue to operate. The Federal Parliament repealed the laws after residents of the Federal Capital Territory voted for the end of them in a 1928 plebiscite.

Since then, some state governments and local councils have enacted dry areas. This is where the purchase or consumption of alcohol is only permitted in licensed areas such as liquor stores, clubs, cafes, bars, hotels, restaurants, and also private homes. In public places such as streets, parks, and squares, consumption is not permitted, but carrying bottles that were purchased at licensed venues is allowed. Almost all dry areas are small defined districts within larger urban or rural communities.

More recently, alcohol has been prohibited in many remote Indigenous communities. Penalties for transporting alcohol into these &quot;dry&quot; communities are severe and can result in confiscation of any vehicles involved; in dry areas within the Northern Territory, all vehicles used to transport alcohol are seized.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, prohibition was a moralistic reform movement begun in the mid-1880s by the Protestant evangelical and Nonconformist churches and the Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union and after 1890 by the Prohibition League. It assumed that individual virtue was all that was needed to carry the colony forward from a pioneering society to a more mature one, but it never achieved its goal of national prohibition. Both the Church of England and the largely Irish Catholic Church rejected prohibition as an intrusion of government into the church&#x27;s domain, while the growing labor movement saw capitalism rather than alcohol as the enemy.

Reformers hoped that the women&#x27;s vote, in which New Zealand was a pioneer, would swing the balance, but the women were not as well organized as in other countries. Prohibition had a majority in a national referendum in 1911, but needed a 60% vote to pass. The movement kept trying in the 1920s, losing three more referendums by close votes; it managed to keep in place a 6 pm closing hour for pubs and Sunday closing. The Depression and war years effectively ended the movement, but their 6 p.m. closing hour remained until October 1967 when it was extended to 10 pm.

For many years, referendums were held for individual towns or electorates, often coincident with general elections. The ballots determined whether these individual areas would be &quot;dry&quot; – that is, alcohol could not be purchased or consumed in public in these areas. One notable example was the southern city of Invercargill, which was dry from 1907 to 1943. People wanting alcohol usually travelled to places outside the city (such as the nearby township of Lorneville or the town of Winton) to drink in the local pubs or purchase alcohol to take back home. The last bastion of this &#x27;dry&#x27; area remains in force in the form of a licensing trust that still to this day governs the sale of liquor in Invercargill. The city does not allow the sale of alcohol (beer and wine included) in supermarkets unlike in the majority of New Zealand, and all form of alcohol regardless of the sort can only be sold in bars and liquor stores.

Prohibition was of limited success in New Zealand as—like in other countries—it led to organised bootlegging. The most famous bootlegged alcohol in New Zealand was that produced in the Hokonui Hills close to the town of Gore (not coincidentally, the nearest large town to Invercargill). Even today, the term &quot;Hokonui&quot; conjures up images of illicit whisky to many New Zealanders.

==Elections==
In many countries in Latin America, the Philippines, Thailand, Turkey, India, and several US states, the sale but not the consumption of alcohol is prohibited before and during elections.

<text>Phenothiazine, abbreviated PTZ, is an organic compound that has the formula S(C6H4)2NH and is related to the thiazine-class of heterocyclic compounds. Derivatives of phenothiazine are highly bioactive and have widespread use and rich history.

The derivatives chlorpromazine and promethazine revolutionized the fields of psychiatry and allergy treatment, respectively. An earlier derivative, methylene blue, was one of the first antimalarial drugs, and derivatives of phenothiazine are currently under investigation as possible anti-infective drugs. Phenothiazine is a prototypical pharmaceutical lead structure in medicinal chemistry.

==Uses==
Phenothiazine itself is only of theoretical interest, but derivatives of it revolutionized psychiatry, other fields of medicine, and pest management. Other derivatives have been studied for possible use in advanced batteries and fuel cells.

=== Phenothiazine-derived drugs ===
In 1876, methylene blue, a derivative of phenothiazine, was synthesized by Heinrich Caro at BASF. The structure was deduced in 1885 by Heinrich August Bernthsen. Bernthsen synthesized phenothiazine in 1883. In the mid 1880s, Paul Ehrlich began to use methylene blue in his cell staining experiments that led to pioneering discoveries about different cell types. He was awarded a Nobel Prize based in part on that work. He became particularly interested in its use to stain bacteria and parasites such as &quot;Plasmodiidae&quot; – the genus that includes the malaria pathogen – and found that it could be stained with methylene blue. He thought methylene blue could possibly be used in the treatment of malaria, tested it clinically, and by the 1890s methylene blue was being used for that purpose.

For the next several decades, research on derivatives lapsed until phenothiazine itself came to market as an insecticide and deworming drug. In the 1940s, chemists working with Paul Charpentier at Rhone-Poulenc Laboratories in Paris (a precursor company to Sanofi), began making derivatives. This work led to promethazine which had no activity against infective organisms, but did have good antihistamine activity, with a strong sedative effect. It went to market as a drug for allergies and for anesthesia. As of 2012 it was still on the market. At the end of the 1940s the same lab produced chlorpromazine which had an even stronger sedative and soothing effect, and Jean Delay and Pierre Deniker attempted to use it on their psychiatric patients, publishing their results in the early 1950s. The strong effects they found opened the door of the modern field of psychiatry and led to a proliferation of work on phenothiazine derivatives. The systematic research conducted by chemists to explore phenothiazine derivatives and their activity was a pioneering example of medicinal chemistry; phenothiazine is often discussed as a prototypical example of a pharmaceutical lead structure.

A number of phenothiazines other than methylene blue have been shown to have antimicrobial effects. In particular, thioridazine has been shown to make extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) drug-susceptible again and make methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. The major reason why thioridazine has not been utilized as an antimicrobial agent is due to adverse effects on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system (particularly QT interval prolongation).

The term &quot;phenothiazines&quot; describes the largest of the five main classes of antipsychotic drugs. These drugs have antipsychotic and, often, antiemetic properties, although they may also cause severe side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms (including akathisia and tardive dyskinesia), hyperprolactinaemia, and the rare but potentially fatal neuroleptic malignant syndrome, as well as substantial weight gain. Use of phenothiazines has been associated with antiphospholipid syndrome, but no causal relationship has been established.

Phenothiazine antipsychotics are classified into three groups that differ with respect to the substituent on nitrogen: the aliphatic compounds (bearing acyclic groups), the &quot;piperidines&quot; (bearing piperidine-derived groups), and the piperazine (bearing piperazine-derived substituents).
=== Nondrug applications ===
The synthetic dye methylene blue, containing the structure, was described in 1876. Many water-soluble phenothiazine derivatives, such as methylene blue, methylene green, thionine, and others, can be electropolymerized into conductive polymers used as electrocatalysts for NADH oxidation in enzymatic biosensors and biofuel cells.

Phenothiazine is used as an anaerobic inhibitor for acrylic acid polymerization, often used as an in-process inhibitor during the purification of acrylic acid.

== Trade names ==
Like many commercially significant compounds, phenothiazine has numerous trade names, including AFI-Tiazin, Agrazine, Antiverm, Biverm, Dibenzothiazine, Orimon, Lethelmin, Souframine, Nemazene, Vermitin, Padophene, Fenoverm, Fentiazine, Contaverm, Fenothiazine, Phenovarm, Ieeno, ENT 38, Helmetina, Helmetine, Penthazine, XL-50, Wurm-thional, Phenegic, Phenovis, Phenoxur, and Reconox.

==Former uses==
Phenothiazine was formerly used as an insecticide and as a drug to treat infections with parasitic worms (anthelminthic) in livestock and people, but its use for those purposes has been superseded by other chemicals.

Phenothiazine was introduced by DuPont as an insecticide in 1935. About 3,500,000 pounds were sold in the US in 1944. However, because it was degraded by sunlight and air, it was difficult to determine how much to use in the field, and its use waned in the 1940s with the arrival of new pesticides like DDT that were more durable. As of July 2015 it is not registered for pesticide use in the US, Europe, or Australia.

=== As an anthelminthic ===

It was introduced as anthelminthic in livestock in 1940 and is considered, with thiabendazole, to be the first modern anthelminthic. The first instances of resistance were noted in 1961. Among anthelmintics, Blizzard et al. 1990 found only paraherquamide to have similar activity to phenothiazine. It is possible that they share the same mode of action. Uses for this purpose in the US are still described but it has &quot;virtually disappeared from the market.&quot;

In the 1940s it also was introduced as antihelminthic for humans; since it was often given to children, the drug was often sold in chocolate, leading to the popular name, &quot;worm chocolate.&quot; Phenothiazine was superseded by other drugs in the 1950s.

== Structure and synthesis==
The central C4SN ring is folded in phenothiazines.

The compound was originally prepared by Bernthsen in 1883 via the reaction of diphenylamine with sulfur, but more recent syntheses rely on the cyclization of 2-substituted diphenyl sulfides. Few pharmaceutically significant phenothiazines are prepared from phenothiazine, although some of them are.

Phenothiazines are electron donors, forming charge-transfer salts with many acceptors.

<doc id="24861" wikidata="Q1229792" url="?curid=24861" title="Pale Fire">
<text>Pale Fire is a 1962 novel by Vladimir Nabokov. The novel is presented as a 999-line poem titled &quot;Pale Fire&quot;, written by the fictional poet John Shade, with a foreword, lengthy commentary and index written by Shade&#x27;s neighbor and academic colleague, Charles Kinbote. Together these elements form a narrative in which both fictional authors are central characters. Nabokov wrote &quot;Pale Fire&quot; in 1960–61, after the success of &quot;Lolita&quot; had made him financially independent, allowing him to retire from teaching and return to Europe. Nabokov began writing the novel in Nice and completed it in Montreux, Switzerland. 

&quot;Pale Fire&quot;&#x27;s unusual structure has attracted much attention, and it is often cited as an important example of metafiction, as well as an analog precursor to hypertext fiction, and a poioumenon. It has spawned a wide variety of interpretations and a large body of written criticism, which literary scholar estimated in 1995 as more than 80 studies. The Nabokov authority Brian Boyd has called it &quot;Nabokov&#x27;s most perfect novel&quot;, and the critic Harold Bloom called it &quot;the surest demonstration of his own genius ... that remarkable tour de force&quot;.

==Novel structure==
Starting with the epigraph and table of contents, &quot;Pale Fire&quot; is apparently the publication of a 999-line poem in four cantos (&quot;Pale Fire&quot;) by the fictional John Shade with a foreword, extensive commentary, and index by his self-appointed editor, Charles Kinbote. Kinbote&#x27;s commentary takes the form of notes to various numbered lines of the poem. Here, as in the rest of his critical apparatus, Kinbote explicates the poem very little. Focusing monomanically on his own concerns, he divulges what proves to be the plot piece by piece, some of which can be connected by following the many cross-references. Espen Aarseth noted that &quot;Pale Fire&quot; &quot;can be read either unicursally, straight through, or multicursally, jumping between the comments and the poem.&quot; Thus, although the narration is non-linear and multidimensional, the reader can still choose to read the novel in a linear manner without risking misinterpretation. 

The interaction between Kinbote and Shade takes place in the fictitious small college town and state of New Wye, Appalachia, where they live across a lane from each other from February to July 1959. Kinbote writes his commentary from then to October 1959 in a tourist cabin in the equally fictitious western town and state of Cedarn, Utana. Both authors recount many earlier events, Shade mostly in New Wye and Kinbote in New Wye and in Europe, especially the &quot;distant northern land&quot; of Zembla.

==Plot summary==
Shade&#x27;s poem digressively describes many aspects of his life. Canto 1 includes his early encounters with death and glimpses of what he takes to be the supernatural. Canto 2 is about his family and the apparent suicide of his daughter, Hazel Shade. Canto 3 focuses on Shade&#x27;s search for knowledge about an afterlife, culminating in a &quot;faint hope&quot; in higher powers &quot;playing a game of worlds&quot; as indicated by apparent coincidences. Canto 4 offers details on Shade&#x27;s daily life and creative process, as well as thoughts on his poetry, which he finds to be a means of somehow understanding the universe.

In Kinbote&#x27;s editorial contributions he tells three stories intermixed with each other. One is his own story, notably including what he thinks of as his friendship with Shade. After Shade was murdered, Kinbote acquired the manuscript, including some variants, and has taken it upon himself to oversee the poem&#x27;s publication, telling readers that it lacks only line 1000. Kinbote&#x27;s second story deals with King Charles II, &quot;The Beloved&quot;, the deposed king of Zembla. King Charles escaped imprisonment by Soviet-backed revolutionaries, making use of a secret passage and brave adherents in disguise. Kinbote repeatedly claims that he inspired Shade to write the poem by recounting King Charles&#x27;s escape to him and that possible allusions to the king, and to Zembla, appear in Shade&#x27;s poem, especially in rejected drafts. However, no explicit reference to King Charles is to be found in the poem. Kinbote&#x27;s third story is that of Gradus, an assassin dispatched by the new rulers of Zembla to kill the exiled King Charles. Gradus makes his way from Zembla through Europe and America to New Wye, suffering comic mishaps. In the last note, to the missing line 1000, Kinbote narrates how Gradus killed Shade by mistake.

Towards the end of the narrative, Kinbote all but states that he is in fact the exiled King Charles, living incognito; however, enough details throughout the story, as well as direct statements of ambiguous sincerity by Kinbote towards the novel&#x27;s end, suggest that King Charles and Zembla are both fictitious. In the latter interpretation, Kinbote is delusional and has built an elaborate picture of Zembla complete with samples of a constructed language as a by-product of insanity; similarly, Gradus was simply an unhinged man trying to kill Shade, and his backstory as a revolutionary assassin is also made up.

In an interview, Nabokov later said that Kinbote killed himself after finishing the book. The critic Michael Wood has stated, &quot;This is authorial trespassing, and we don&#x27;t have to pay attention to it&quot;, but Brian Boyd has argued that internal evidence points to Kinbote&#x27;s suicide. One of Kinbote&#x27;s annotations to Shade&#x27;s poem (corresponding to line 493) addresses the subject of suicide at some length.

==Explanation of the title==
As Nabokov pointed out himself, the title of John Shade&#x27;s poem is from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Timon of Athens:&quot; &quot;The moon&#x27;s an arrant thief, / And her pale fire she snatches from the sun&quot; (Act IV, scene 3), a line often taken as a metaphor about creativity and inspiration. Kinbote quotes the passage but does not recognize it, as he says he has access only to an inaccurate Zemblan translation of the play &quot;in his cave&quot;, and in a separate note he even rails against the common practice of using quotations as titles.

Some critics have noted a secondary reference in the book&#x27;s title to &quot;Hamlet&quot;, where the Ghost remarks how the glow-worm &quot;&#x27;gins to pale his uneffectual fire&quot; (Act I, scene 5).

The title is first mentioned in the foreword: &quot;I recall seeing him from my porch, on a brilliant morning, burning a whole stack of [index cards of drafts of the poem] in the pale fire of the incinerator...&quot;.

==Reception==
According to Norman Page, &quot;Pale Fire&quot; excited as diverse criticism as any of Nabokov&#x27;s novels. Mary McCarthy&#x27;s review was extremely laudatory; the Vintage edition excerpts it on the front cover. She tried to explicate hidden references and connections. Dwight Macdonald responded by saying the book was &quot;unreadable&quot; and both it and McCarthy&#x27;s review were as pedantic as Kinbote. Anthony Burgess, like McCarthy, extolled the book, while Alfred Chester condemned it as &quot;a total wreck&quot;.

Some other early reviews were less decided, praising the book&#x27;s satire and comedy but noting its difficulty and finding its subject slight or saying that its artistry offers &quot;only a kibitzer&#x27;s pleasure&quot;. Macdonald called the reviews he had seen, other than McCarthy&#x27;s, &quot;cautiously unfavorable&quot;. &quot;Time&quot;″s 1962 review stated that &quot;&quot;Pale Fire&quot; does not really cohere as a satire; good as it is, the novel in the end seems to be mostly an exercise in agility – or perhaps in bewilderment&quot;, though this did not prevent the publication from including the book in its 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923.

The connection between &quot;Pale Fire&quot; and hypertext was stated soon after its publication; in 1969, the information-technology researcher Ted Nelson obtained permission from the novel&#x27;s publishers to use it for a hypertext demonstration at Brown University. A 2009 paper by Annalisa Volpone also compares &quot;Pale Fire&quot; to hypertext.

The first Russian translation of the novel, one created by Véra Nabokov, its dedicatee, was published in 1983 by Ardis in Ann Arbor, Michigan (Alexei Tsvetkov initially played an important role in this translation). 

After Nabokov&#x27;s reputation was rehabilitated in the Soviet Union (his novels started being published there in 1986 and the first book composed entirely of Nabokov&#x27;s works was printed in 1988), &quot;Pale Fire&quot; was published in 1991 in Sverdlovsk (in Sergei Ilyin&#x27;s Russian translation).

It was ranked 53rd on the list of the Modern Library 100 Best Novels and 1st on the American literary critic Larry McCaffery&#x27;s &quot;20th Century&#x27;s Greatest Hits: 100 English-Language Books of Fiction.&quot;

==Interpretations==
Some readers concentrate on the apparent story, focusing on traditional aspects of fiction such as the relationship among the characters. In 1997, Brian Boyd published a much-discussed study arguing that the ghost of John Shade influenced Kinbote&#x27;s contributions. He expanded this essay into a book in which he also argues that, in order to trigger Shade&#x27;s poem, Hazel Shade&#x27;s ghost induced Kinbote to recount his Zemblan delusions to Shade.

Some readers, starting with Mary McCarthy and including Boyd, Nabokov&#x27;s annotator Alfred Appel, and D. Barton Johnson, see Charles Kinbote as an alter-ego of the insane Professor V. Botkin, to whose delusions John Shade and the rest of the faculty of Wordsmith College generally condescend. Nabokov himself endorsed this reading, stating in an interview in 1962 (the novel&#x27;s year of publication) that &quot;Pale Fire&quot; &quot;is full of plums that I keep hoping somebody will find. For instance, the nasty commentator is not an ex-King of Zembla nor is he professor Kinbote. He is professor Botkin, or Botkine, a Russian and a madman.&quot; The novel&#x27;s intricate structure of teasing cross-references leads readers to this &quot;plum&quot;. The Index, supposedly created by Kinbote, features an entry for a &quot;Botkin, V.,&quot; describing this Botkin as an &quot;American scholar of Russian descent&quot;—and referring to a note in the Commentary on line 894 of Shade&#x27;s poem, in which no such person is directly mentioned but a character suggests that &quot;Kinbote&quot; is &quot;a kind of anagram of Botkin or Botkine&quot;. In this interpretation, &quot;Gradus&quot; the murderer is an American named Jack Grey who wanted to kill Judge Goldsworth, whose house &quot;Pale Fire&#x27;s&quot; commentator—whatever his &quot;true&quot; name is—is renting. Goldsworth had condemned Grey to an asylum from which he escaped shortly before mistakenly killing Shade, who resembled Goldsworth.

Other readers see a story quite different from the apparent narrative. &quot;Shadeans&quot; maintain that John Shade wrote not only the poem, but the commentary as well, having invented his own death and the character of Kinbote as a literary device. According to Boyd, Andrew Field invented the Shadean theory and Julia Bader expanded it; Boyd himself espoused the theory for a time. In an alternative version of the Shadean theory, Tiffany DeRewal and Matthew Roth argued that Kinbote is not a separate person but is a dissociated, alternative personality of John Shade. (An early reviewer had mentioned that &quot;a case might be made&quot; for such a reading.)
&quot;Kinboteans&quot;, a decidedly smaller group, believe that Kinbote invented the existence of John Shade. Boyd credits the Kinbotean theory to Page Stegner and adds that most of its adherents are newcomers to the book. Some readers see the book as oscillating undecidably between these alternatives, like the Rubin vase (a drawing that may be two profiles or a goblet).

Though a minority of commentators believe or at least accept the possibility that Zembla is as &quot;real&quot; as New Wye, most assume that Zembla, or at least the operetta-quaint and homosexually gratified palace life enjoyed by Charles Kinbote before he is overthrown, is imaginary in the context of the story. The name &quot;Zembla&quot; (taken from &quot;Nova Zembla&quot;, a former latinization of Novaya Zemlya) may evoke popular fantasy literature about royalty such as &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;. As in other Nabokov books, however, the fiction is an exaggerated or comically distorted version of his own life as a son of privilege before the Russian Revolution and an exile afterwards, and the central murder has resemblances (emphasized by Priscilla Meyer) to Nabokov&#x27;s father&#x27;s murder by an assassin who was trying to kill someone else.

Still other readers de-emphasize any sort of &quot;real story&quot; and may doubt the existence of such a thing. In the interplay of allusions and thematic links, they find a multifaceted image of English literature, criticism, or glimpses of a higher world and an afterlife.

==Allusions and references==
The first two lines of John Shade&#x27;s 999-line poem, &quot;Pale Fire&quot;, have become Nabokov&#x27;s most quoted couplet:

&lt;poem&gt;I was the shadow of the waxwing slain
By the false azure in the window pane&lt;/poem&gt;

Like many of Nabokov&#x27;s fictions, &quot;Pale Fire&quot; alludes to others of his. &quot;Hurricane Lolita&quot; is mentioned, and &quot;Pnin&quot; appears as a minor character. There are many resemblances to &quot;Ultima Thule&quot; and &quot;Solus Rex&quot;, two short stories by Nabokov intended to be the first two chapters of a novel in Russian that he never continued. The placename Thule appears in &quot;Pale Fire&quot;, as does the phrase &quot;solus rex&quot; (a chess problem in which one player has no pieces but the king).

However, a different player, Sam Chapman of the Philadelphia Athletics, did hit a home run in the 9th inning on September 29, 1938, to defeat the Yankees, 5–4.

<text>A preservative is a substance or a chemical that is added to products such as food products, beverages, pharmaceutical drugs, paints, biological samples, cosmetics, wood, and many other products to prevent decomposition by microbial growth or by undesirable chemical changes. In general, preservation is implemented in two modes, chemical and physical. Chemical preservation entails adding chemical compounds to the product. Physical preservation entails processes such as refrigeration or drying. Preservative food additives reduce the risk of foodborne infections, decrease microbial spoilage, and preserve fresh attributes and nutritional quality. Some physical techniques for food preservation include dehydration, UV-C radiation, freeze-drying, and refrigeration. Chemical preservation and physical preservation techniques are sometimes combined.

==Food preservation==

Preservatives have been used since prehistoric times. Smoked meat for example has phenols and other chemicals that delay spoilage. The preservation of foods has evolved greatly over the centuries and has been instrumental in increasing food security. The use of preservatives other than traditional oils, salts, paints, etc. in food began in the late 19th century, but was not widespread until the 20th century.

The use of food preservatives varies greatly depending on the country. Many developing countries that do not have strong governments to regulate food additives face either harmful levels of preservatives in foods or a complete avoidance of foods that are considered unnatural or foreign. These countries have also proven useful in case studies surrounding chemical preservatives, as they have been only recently introduced. In urban slums of highly populated countries, the knowledge about contents of food tends to be extremely low, despite consumption of these imported foods.

===Antimicrobial preservatives===
Antimicrobial preservatives prevent degradation by bacteria. This method is the most traditional and ancient type of preserving—ancient methods such as pickling and adding honey prevent microorganism growth by modifying the pH level. The most commonly used antimicrobial preservative is lactic acid. Common antimicrobial preservatives are presented in the table. Nitrates and nitrites are also antimicrobial. The detailed mechanism of these chemical compounds range from inhibiting growth of the bacteria to the inhibition of specific enzymes.
===Antioxidants===
The oxidation process spoils most food, especially those with a high fat content. Fats quickly turn rancid when exposed to oxygen. Antioxidants prevent or inhibit the oxidation process. The most common antioxidant additives are ascorbic acid (vitamin C) and ascorbates. Thus, antioxidants are commonly added to oils, cheese, and chips. Other antioxidants include the phenol derivatives BHA, BHT, TBHQ and propyl gallate. These agents suppress the formation of hydroperoxides.
A variety of agents are added to sequester (deactivate) metal ions that otherwise catalyze the oxidation of fats. Common sequestering agents are disodium EDTA, citric acid (and citrates), tartaric acid, and lecithin.

===Nonsynthetic compounds for food preservation===

Citric and ascorbic acids target enzymes that degrade fruits and vegetables, e.g., mono/polyphenol oxidase which turns surfaces of cut apples and potatoes brown. Ascorbic acid and tocopherol, which are vitamins, are common preservatives. Smoking entails exposing food to a variety of phenols, which are antioxidants. Natural preservatives include rosemary and oregano extract, hops, salt, sugar, vinegar, alcohol, diatomaceous earth and castor oil.

Traditional preservatives, such as sodium benzoate have raised health concerns in the past. Benzoate was shown in a study to cause hypersensitivity in some asthma sufferers. This has caused reexamination of natural preservatives which occur in vegetables.

===Public awareness of food preservation===

Public awareness of food preservatives is uneven. Americans have a perception that food-borne illnesses happen more often in other countries. This may be true, but the occurrence of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths are still high. It is estimated by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) that each year there are 76 million illnesses, 325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths linked to food-borne illness.

Food suppliers are facing difficulties with regards to the safety and quality of their products as a result of the rising demand for ready-to-eat fresh food products. Artificial preservatives meet some of these challenges by preserving freshness for longer periods of time, but these preservatives can cause negative side-effects as well.
* Sodium nitrite is a preservative used in lunch meats, hams, sausages, hot dogs, and bacon to prevent botulism and other foodborne pathogens. It serves the important function of controlling the bacteria that cause botulism, but sodium nitrite can react with proteins, or during cooking at high heats, to form carcinogenic N-nitrosamines. It has also been linked to cancer in lab animals.
* The commonly used sodium benzoate has been found to extend the shelf life of bottled tomato paste to 40 weeks without loss of quality. However, it can form the carcinogen benzene when combined with vitamin C. Many food manufacturers have reformed their products to eliminate this combination, but a risk still exists.
* Consumption of sodium benzoate may also cause hyperactivity in children, though the studies are inconclusive with a moderate effect size.

== Preservation of other products ==

Water-based home and personal care products use broad-spectrum preservatives, such as isothiazolinones and formaldehyde releasers, which may cause sensitization, leading to allergic skin.

<text>Pseudomonadota (synonym &quot;Proteobacteria&quot;) is a major phylum of Gram-negative bacteria. Currently, they are considered the predominant phylum within the realm of bacteria. They are naturally found as pathogenic and free-living (non-parasitic) genera. The phylum comprises six classes &quot;Acidithiobacillia, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Hydrogenophilia&quot;, and &quot;Zetaproteobacteria.&quot; The Pseudomonadota are widely diverse, with differences in morphology, metabolic processes, relevance to humans, and ecological influence.

== Classification ==
American microbiologist Carl Woese established this grouping in 1987, calling it informally the &quot;purple bacteria and their relatives&quot;. The group was later formally named the &#x27;Proteobacteria&#x27; after the Greek god Proteus, who was known to assume many forms. In 2021 the International Committee on Systematics of Prokaryotes designated the synonym Pseudomonadota, and renamed many other prokaryotic phyla as well. This renaming of several prokaryote phyla in 2021, including Pseudomonadota, remains controversial among microbiologists, many of whom continue to use the earlier name Proteobacteria, of long standing in the literature. The phylum Pseudomonadota encompasses classes &quot;Acidithiobacillia, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Hydrogenophilia&quot;, and &quot;Zetaproteobacteria.&quot; The phylum includes a wide variety of pathogenic genera, such as &quot;Escherichia&quot;, &quot;Salmonella&quot;, &quot;Vibrio&quot;, &quot;Yersinia&quot;, &quot;Legionella&quot;, and many others. Others are free-living (non-parasitic) and include many of the bacteria responsible for nitrogen fixation.

Previously, the Pseudomonadota phylum included two additional classes, namely &quot;Deltaproteobacteria&quot; and &quot;Oligoflexia&quot;. However, further investigation into the phylogeny of these taxa through genomic marker analysis demonstrated their separation from the Pseudomonadota phylum. &quot;Deltaproteobacteria&quot; has been identified as a diverse taxonomic unit, leading to a proposal for its reclassification into distinct phyla: &quot;Desulfobacterota&quot; (encompassing &quot;Thermodesulfobacteria&quot;), &quot;Myxococcota&quot;, and &quot;Bdellovibrionota&quot; (comprising &quot;Oligoflexia&quot;).

The class &quot;Epsilonproteobacteria&quot; was additionally identified within the Pseudomonadota phylum. This class is characterized by its significance as chemolithotrophic primary producers and its metabolic prowess in deep-sea hydrothermal vent ecosystems. Noteworthy pathogenic genera within this class include &quot;Campylobacter, Helicobacter, and Arcobacter&quot;. Analysis of phylogenetic tree topology and genetic markers revealed the direct divergence of &quot;Epsilonproteobacteria&quot; from the Pseudomonadota phylum. Limited outgroup data and low bootstrap values support these discoveries. Despite further investigations, consensus has not been reached regarding the monophyletic nature of &quot;Epsilonproteobacteria&quot; within Proteobacteria, prompting researchers to propose its taxonomic separation from the phylum. The proposed reclassification of the name &quot;Epsilonproteobacteria&quot; is &quot;Epsilonbacteraeota&quot;, later revised to &quot;Campylobacterota&quot; in 2018.

==Taxonomy==
The currently accepted taxonomy is based on the List of Prokaryotic names with Standing in Nomenclature (LSPN) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).

The group Pseudomonadota is defined based on ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing, and are divided into several subclasses. These subclasses were regarded as such for many years, but are now treated as various classes of the phylum. These classes are monophyletic. The genus &quot;Acidithiobacillus&quot;, part of the Gammaproteobacteria until it was transferred to class Acidithiobacillia in 2013, was previously regarded as paraphyletic to the &quot;Betaproteobacteria&quot; according to multigenome alignment studies. In 2017, the Betaproteobacteria was subject to major revisions and the class Hydrogenophilalia was created to contain the order Hydrogenophilales

Pseudomonadota classes with validly published names include some prominent genera: e.g.:
* Acidithiobacillia: &quot;Acidithiobacillus&quot;, &quot;Thermithiobacillus&quot;
* Alphaproteobacteria: &quot;Brucella, Rhizobium, Agrobacterium, Caulobacter, Rickettsia, Wolbachia&quot;, etc.
* Betaproteobacteria: &quot;Bordetella, Ralstonia, Neisseria, Nitrosomonas&quot;, etc.
* Gammaproteobacteria: &quot;Escherichia, Shigella, Salmonella, Yersinia, Buchnera, Haemophilus, Vibrio, Pseudomonas&quot;, Pasteurella&quot;, etc.&quot;
* Zetaproteobacteria: &quot;Mariprofundus&quot;

==Characteristics==
Pseudomonadota are a diverse group. Though some species may stain Gram-positive or Gram-variable in the laboratory, they are nominally Gram-negative. Their unique outer membrane is mainly composed of lipopolysaccharides, which helps differentiate them from the Gram-positive species. Most Pseudomonadota are motile and move using flagella. Many move about using flagella, but some are nonmotile, or rely on bacterial gliding.

Pseudomonadota have a wide variety of metabolism types. Most are facultative or obligate anaerobes, chemolithoautotrophs, and heterotrophs, though numerous exceptions exist. A variety of distantly related genera within the Pseudomonadota obtain their energy from light through conventional photosynthesis or anoxygenic photosynthesis.

The Acidithiobacillia contain only sulfur, iron, and uranium-oxidizing autotrophs. The type order is the Acidithiobacillaceae, which includes five different &quot;Acidithiobacillus&quot; species used in the mining industry. In particular, these microbes assist with the process of bioleaching, which involves microbes assisting in metal extraction from mining waste that typically extraction methods cannot remove.

Some Alphaproteobacteria can grow at very low levels of nutrients and have unusual morphology within their life cycles. Some form stalks to help with colonization, and form buds during cell division. Others include agriculturally important bacteria capable of inducing nitrogen fixation in symbiosis with plants. The type order is the Caulobacterales, comprising stalk-forming bacteria such as &quot;Caulobacter&quot;. The mitochondria of eukaryotes are thought to be descendants of an alphaproteobacterium.

The Betaproteobacteria are highly metabolically diverse and contain chemolithoautotrophs, photoautotrophs, and generalist heterotrophs. The type order is the Burkholderiales, comprising an enormous range of metabolic diversity, including opportunistic pathogens. These pathogens are primary for both humans and animals, such as the horse pathogen &quot;Burkholderia mallei&quot;, and &quot;Burkholderia cepacia&quot; which causes respiratory tract infections in people with cystic fibrosis.

The Gammaproteobacteria are one of the largest classes in terms of genera, containing approximately 250 validly published names. The type order is the Pseudomonadales, which include the genera &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; and the nitrogen-fixing &quot;Azotobacter&quot;, along with many others. Besides being a well-known pathogenic genus, &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; is also capable of biodegradation of certain materials, like cellulose.

The Hydrogenophilalia are thermophilic chemoheterotrophs and autotrophs. The bacteria typically use hydrogen gas as an electron donor, but can also use reduced sulfuric compounds. Because of this ability, scientists have begun to use certain species of Hydrogenophilalia to remove sulfides that contaminate industrial wastewater systems. The type order is the Hydrogenophilaceae which contains the genera &quot;Thiobacillus, Petrobacter, Sulfuricella,&quot; &quot;Hydrogenophilus&quot; and &quot;Tepidiphilus&quot;. Currently, no members of this class have been identified as pathogenic.

The Zetaproteobacteria are the iron-oxidizing neutrophilic chemolithoautotrophs, distributed worldwide in estuaries and marine habitats. This group is so successful in its environment due to their microaerophilic nature. Because they require less oxygen than what is present in the atmosphere, they are able to compete with the abiotic iron(II) oxidation that is already occurring in the environment. The only confirmed type order for this class is the Mariprofundaceae, which does not contain any known pathogenic species.

==Transformation==

Transformation, a process in which genetic material passes from one bacterium to another, has been reported in at least 30 species of Pseudomonadota distributed in the classes alpha, beta, and gamma. The best-studied Pseudomonadota with respect to natural genetic transformation are the medically important human pathogens &quot;Neisseria gonorrhoeae&quot; (class beta), and &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; (class gamma). Natural genetic transformation is a sexual process involving DNA transfer from one bacterial cell to another through the intervening medium and the integration of the donor sequence into the recipient genome. In pathogenic Pseudomonadota, transformation appears to serve as a DNA repair process that protects the pathogen&#x27;s DNA from attack by their host&#x27;s phagocytic defenses that employ oxidative free radicals.

==Habitat==
Due to the distinctive nature of each of the six classes of Pseudomonadota, this phylum occupies a multitude of habitats. These include:

* Human oral cavity
* Microbial mats in the deep sea
* Marine sediments
* Thermal sulfur springs
* Agricultural soil
* Hydrothermal vents
* Stem nodules of legumes
* Within aphids as endosymbionts
* Gastrointestinal tract of warm-blooded species
* Brackish, estuary waters
* Microbiomes of shrimp and mollusks
* Human vaginal tract
* Potato rhizosphere microbiome

== Significance ==

=== Human health ===
Studies have suggested Pseudomonadota as a relevant signature of disease in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract, by operating as a marker for microbiota instability. The human gut microbiome consists mainly of four phyla: Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Pseudomonadota. Microorganism gut colonization is dynamic from birth to death, with stabilization at the first few years of life, to higher diversity in adults, to reduced diversity in the elderly. The gut microbiome conducts processes like nutrient synthesis, chemical metabolism, and the formation of the gut barrier. Additionally, the gut microbiome facilitates host interactions with its surrounding environment through regulation of nutrient absorption and bacterial intake. In 16s rRNA and metagenome sequencing studies, Proteobacteria have been identified as bacteria that prompts endotoxemia (an inflammatory gut response) and metabolic disorders in human GI tracts. Another study by Michail et al. showed a correlation of microbial composition in children with and without nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), wherein patients with NAFLD have a higher abundance of Gammaproteobacteria than patients without the disease.

Classes Betaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria are prevalent within the human oral cavity, and are markers for good oral health. The oral microbiome consists of 11 habitats, including the tongue dorsum, hard palate, tonsils, throat, saliva, and more. Changes in the oral microbiome are due to endogenous and exogenous factors like host lifestyle, genotype, environment, immune system, and socioeconomic status. Considering diet as a factor, high saturated fatty acid (SAF) content, achieved through poor diet, has been correlated to increased abundance of Betaproteobacteria in the oral cavity.

=== Economic value ===
Pseudomonadota bacteria have a symbiotic or mutualistic association with plant roots, an example being in the rhizomes of potato plants. Because of this symbiotic relationship, farmers have the ability to increase their crop yields. Healthier root systems can lead to better nutrient uptake, improved water retention, increased resistance to diseases and pests, and ultimately higher crop yields per acre. Increased agricultural output can spark economic growth, contribute to food security, and lead to job creation in rural areas.

As briefly mentioned in previous sections, members of &quot;Pseudomonadota&quot; have vast metabolic abilities that allow them to utilize and produce a variety of compounds. Bioleaching, done by various &quot;Thiobacillus&quot; species, are a primary example of this. Any iron and sulfur oxidizing species has the potential to uncover metals and low-grade ores that conventional mining techniques were unable to extract. At present, they are most often used for recovering copper and uranium, but researchers are looking to expand this field in the future. The downside of this method is that the bacteria produce acidic byproducts that end up in acid mine drainage. Bioleaching has significant economic promise if it can be controlled and not cause any further harm to the environment.

=== Ecological impact ===
Pseudomonadota are microbes commonly found within soil systems. Microbes play a crucial role in the surrounding ecosystem by performing functions such as nutrient cycling, carbon dioxide fixation, decomposition, and nitrogen fixation. Pseudomonadota can be described as phototrophs, heterotrophs, and lithotrophs. As heterotrophs (examples &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; and &quot;Xanthomonas&quot;) these bacteria are effective in breaking down organic matter, contributing to nutrient cycling. Additionally, photolithotrophs within the phylum are able to perform photosynthesis using sulfide or elemental sulfur as electron donors, which enables them to participate in carbon fixation and oxygen production even in anaerobic conditions. These Pseudomonadota bacteria are also considered copiotrophic organisms, meaning they can be found in environments with high nutrient availability. These environments have ample sources of carbon and other nutrients, environments like fertile soils, compost, and sewage. These copiotrophic bacteria are able to enhance soil health by performing nutrient cycling and waste decomposition.

Because this phylum are able to form a symbiotic relationship with plant roots, incorporating Pseudomonadota into agricultural practices aligns with principles of sustainable farming. These bacteria contribute to soil health and fertility, promote natural pest management, and enhance the resilience of crops to environmental stressors.
