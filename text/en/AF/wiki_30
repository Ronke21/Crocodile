<text>Rhode Island (, pronounced &quot;road&quot;) is a state in the New England region of the Northeastern United States. It borders Connecticut to its west; Massachusetts to its north and east; and the Atlantic Ocean to its south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound; and shares a small maritime border with New York, east of Long Island. Rhode Island is the smallest U.S. state by area and the seventh-least populous, with slightly more than 1.1 million residents as of 2024. The state&#x27;s population, however, has continually recorded growth in every decennial census since 1790, and it is the second-most densely populated state after New Jersey. The state takes its name from the eponymous island, though nearly all its land area is on the mainland. Providence is its capital and most populous city.

Native Americans lived around Narragansett Bay before English settlers began arriving in the early 17th century. Rhode Island was unique among the Thirteen British Colonies in having been founded by a refugee, Roger Williams, who fled religious persecution in the Massachusetts Bay Colony to establish a haven for religious liberty. He founded Providence in 1636 on land purchased from local tribes, creating the first settlement in North America with an explicitly secular government. The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations subsequently became a destination for religious and political dissenters and social outcasts, earning it the moniker &quot;Rogue&#x27;s Island&quot;.

Rhode Island was the first colony to call for a Continental Congress, in 1774, and the first to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown, on May 4, 1776. After the American Revolution, during which it was heavily occupied and contested, Rhode Island became the fourth state to ratify the Articles of Confederation, on February 9, 1778. Because its citizens favored a weaker central government, it boycotted the 1787 convention that had drafted the United States Constitution, which it initially refused to ratify; it finally ratified it on May 29, 1790, the last of the original 13 states to do so.

The state was officially named the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations since the colonial era but came to be commonly known as &quot;Rhode Island&quot;. On November 3, 2020, the state&#x27;s voters approved an amendment to the state constitution formally dropping &quot;and Providence Plantations&quot; from its full name. Its official nickname, found on its welcome sign, is the &quot;Ocean State&quot;, a reference to its of coastline and the large bays and inlets that make up about 14% of its area.

==Name==
===Origin of the name===
Despite its name, most of Rhode Island is on the U.S. mainland. Its official name was &quot;State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations&quot; from its beginning in 1636 until 2020, and it is referred to in that manner in the United States Constitution. This name was derived from the merger of Colonial settlements around Narragansett Bay, and outside the jurisdiction of Plymouth colony. The settlements of Rhode Island (Newport and Portsmouth) were on Rhode Island, also known as Aquidneck Island. &quot;Providence Plantations&quot; referred to settlements on the mainland of Providence and Warwick.

It is unclear how the island came to be named &quot;Rhode Island&quot;, but two historical events may have been influential:

* Explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano noted the presence of an island near the mouth of Narragansett Bay in 1524 which he likened to the island of Rhodes off the coast of Greece. Subsequent European explorers were unable to precisely identify the island Verrazzano described, but the colonists who settled the area assumed that it was this island.
* Adriaen Block passed by the island during his expeditions in the 1610s, and described it in a 1625 account of his travels as &quot;an island of reddish appearance&quot;, which was &quot;&quot; in 17th-century Dutch, meaning a red or reddish island, supposedly evolving into the designation Rhode Island. Historians have theorized that this &quot;reddish appearance&quot; resulted from either red autumn foliage or red clay on portions of the shore.

The earliest documented use of the name &quot;Rhode Island&quot; for Aquidneck was in 1637 by Roger Williams. The name was officially applied to the island in 1644 with these words: &quot;Aquethneck shall be henceforth called the Isle of Rodes or Rhode-Island.&quot; The name &quot;Isle of Rodes&quot; is used in a legal document as late as 1646. Dutch maps as early as 1659 call the island &quot;Red Island&quot; ().

===Changes to the name===
The first English settlement in Rhode Island was the town of Providence, which the Narragansett granted to Roger Williams in 1636. At that time, Williams obtained no permission from the English crown, as he believed the English had no legitimate claim on Narragansett and Wampanoag territory. Williams traveled to London in 1643, during the English Civil War, to obtain legal recognition of the new settlements. A Patent was granted to &quot;the incorporation of Providence Plantations in Narragansett Bay in New England&quot; by the Parliamentary committee on Foreign Plantations. After the English Civil war, a Royal Charter was granted in 1663, giving the colony an official name of the &quot;Governor and Company of the English Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, in New England, in America.&quot; Following the American Revolution, in 1790 the new state incorporated as the &quot;State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations&quot;. However, as matter of convenience, the state came to be commonly known as simply &quot;Rhode Island&quot;.

The word &quot;plantation&quot; in the state&#x27;s name became a contested issue during the 20th century and the increased awareness of slavery and its role in early Rhode Island history. The General Assembly voted in 2009 to hold a referendum in November 2010 on removing &quot;and Providence Plantations&quot; from the official name. Advocates for excising &quot;plantation&quot; argued that the word symbolized a legacy of disenfranchisement for many Rhode Islanders, as well as the proliferation of slavery in the colonies and in the post-colonial United States. Advocates for retaining the name argued that &quot;plantation&quot; was simply an archaic synonym for &quot;colony&quot; and bore no relation to slavery. The people voted overwhelmingly (78% to 22%) to retain the entire original name.

In June 2020, State Senator Harold Metts introduced a resolution for another ballot referendum on the subject, saying, &quot;Whatever the meaning of the term &#x27;plantations&#x27; in the context of Rhode Island&#x27;s history, it carries a horrific connotation when considering the tragic and racist history of our nation.&quot; Governor Gina Raimondo issued an executive order to remove the phrase from a range of official documents and state websites. In July, amidst the George Floyd protests and nationwide calls to address systemic racism, the resolution referring the question to the voters was passed by both houses of the Rhode Island General Assembly: 69–1 in the House of Representatives, and 35–0 in the Senate. The change was then approved by voters 52.8% to 47.2% as part of the 2020 United States elections, taking effect in November 2020 upon certification of the results.

==History==
===Colonial era: 1636–1770===
At the onset of European colonization what is now Rhode Island was inhabited mainly by five Native American tribes - by far most of the state&#x27;s territory was inhabited by the Narragansett, eastern borderlands were occupied by the Wampanoag, south-western coast by the Niantic, western borderlands by the Pequot and northern borderlands by the Nipmuc. In 1636, Roger Williams was banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony for his religious views, and he settled at the top of Narragansett Bay on land sold or given to him by Narragansett sachem Canonicus. He named the site Providence, &quot;having a sense of God&#x27;s merciful providence unto me in my distress&quot;, and it became a place of religious freedom where all were welcome.
In 1638 (after conferring with Williams), Anne Hutchinson, William Coddington, John Clarke, Philip Sherman, and other religious dissenters were allowed to settle on Aquidneck Island (also known as Rhode Island), by the Narragansett Sachems Canonicus and Miantonomi. They were given a few items in reciprocity for their generosity. However, as Roger Williams made clear in a letter to John Winthrop in June 1638: &quot;Sir, concerning the islands Prudence and…Aquedenick…neither of them were sold properly, for a thousand fathom would not have bought either, by strangers. The truth is, not a penny was demanded for either, and what was paid was only gratuity, though I chose, for better assurance and form, to call it sale.&quot; This settlement was first called Pocasset and then changed in 1639 to Portsmouth. The town was governed by the Portsmouth Compact. The island&#x27;s southern part became the separate settlement of Newport after disagreements among the founders.

Samuel Gorton purchased lands at Shawomet in 1642 from the Narragansetts, precipitating a dispute with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. In 1644, Providence, Portsmouth, and Newport united for their common independence as the Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, governed by an elected council and &quot;president&quot;. Gorton received a separate charter for his settlement in 1648 which he named Warwick after his patron.

Metacomet was the Wampanoag tribe&#x27;s war leader, whom the colonists called King Philip. They invaded and burned down several of the towns in the area during King Philip&#x27;s War (1675–1676), including Providence which was attacked twice. A force of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Plymouth militia under General Josiah Winslow invaded and destroyed the fortified Narragansett Indian village in the Great Swamp in South Kingstown, Rhode Island on December 19, 1675. In one of the final actions of the war, an Indian associated with Benjamin Church killed King Philip in Bristol, Rhode Island.

The colony was amalgamated into the Dominion of New England in 1686, as King James II attempted to enforce royal authority over the autonomous colonies in British North America, but the colony regained its independence under the Royal Charter after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Slaves were introduced in Rhode Island at this time, although there is no record of any law legalizing slave-holding. The colony later prospered under the slave trade, distilling rum to sell in Africa as part of a profitable triangular trade in slaves and sugar with the Caribbean. Rhode Island&#x27;s legislative body passed an act in 1652 abolishing the holding of slaves (the first British colony to do so), but this edict was never enforced and Rhode Island continued to be heavily involved in the slave trade during the post-revolution era. In 1774, the slave population of Rhode Island was 6.3% of the total (nearly twice the ratio of other New England colonies).

Brown University was founded in 1764 as the College in the British Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations. It was one of nine Colonial colleges granted charters before the American Revolution and was the first college in America to accept students regardless of religious affiliation.

===Revolutionary to Civil War period: 1770–1860===

Rhode Island&#x27;s tradition of independence and dissent gave it a prominent role in the American Revolution. At approximately 2 a.m. on June 10, 1772, a band of Providence residents attacked the grounded revenue schooner &quot;HMS Gaspée&quot;, burning it to the waterline for enforcing unpopular trade regulations within Narragansett Bay. Rhode Island was the first of the thirteen colonies to renounce its allegiance to the British Crown on May 4, 1776. It was also the last of the thirteen colonies to ratify the United States Constitution on May 29, 1790, and only under threat of heavy trade tariffs from the other former colonies and after assurances were made that a Bill of Rights would become part of the Constitution.

During the Revolution, the British occupied Newport in December 1776. A combined Franco-American force fought to drive them off Aquidneck Island. Portsmouth was the site of the first African-American military unit, the 1st Rhode Island Regiment, to fight for the U.S. in the unsuccessful Battle of Rhode Island of August 29, 1778. A month earlier, the appearance of a French fleet off Newport caused the British to scuttle some of their own ships in an attempt to block the harbor. The British abandoned Newport in October 1779, concentrating their forces in New York City. An expedition of 5,500 French troops under Count Rochambeau arrived in Newport by sea on July 10, 1780. The celebrated march to Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781 ended with the defeat of the British at the Siege of Yorktown and the Battle of the Chesapeake.

Rhode Island was also heavily involved in the Industrial Revolution, which began in America in 1787 when Thomas Somers reproduced textile machine plans which he imported from England. He helped to produce the Beverly Cotton Manufactory, in which Moses Brown of Providence took an interest. Moses Brown teamed up with Samuel Slater and helped to create the second cotton mill in America, a water-powered textile mill. The Industrial Revolution moved large numbers of workers into the cities. With the 1663 colonial charter still in effect, voting was restricted to landowners holding at least $134 in property. At the time of the revolution, 80% of White men in Rhode Island could vote; by 1840, only 40% were still eligible. The charter apportioned legislative seats equally among the state&#x27;s towns, over-representing rural areas and under-representing the growing industrial centers. Additionally, the charter disallowed landless citizens from filing civil suits without endorsement from a landowner. Bills were periodically introduced in the legislature to expand suffrage, but they were invariably defeated.

In 1841, activists led by Thomas W. Dorr organized an extralegal convention to draft a state constitution, arguing the charter government violated the Guarantee Clause in Article Four, Section Four of the United States Constitution. In 1842, the charter government and Dorr&#x27;s supporters held separate elections, and two rival governments claimed sovereignty over the state. Dorr&#x27;s supporters led an armed rebellion against the charter government, and Dorr was arrested and imprisoned for treason against the state.

In response, the legislature drafted a state constitution which replaced property requirements for American-born citizens with a $1 poll tax, . In a heavily boycotted election in November 1842, voters approved the constitution. Voters also declined to limit the change to &quot;white&quot; men, thus re-enfranchising Black men—Black men meeting the property requirements had been able to vote in Rhode Island until 1822. The constitution also ended slavery. Immigrants remained subject to the property requirement, effectively disenfranchising many Irish-Americans and maintaining urban under-representation. In 1849, in Luther v. Borden, the US Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutional question raised in Dorr&#x27;s rebellion, holding that it was a political question outside its jurisdiction.

In the early 19th century, Rhode Island was subject to a tuberculosis outbreak which led to public hysteria about vampirism.

===Civil War===

During the American Civil War, Rhode Island was the first Union state to send troops in response to President Lincoln&#x27;s request for help from the states. Rhode Island furnished 23,700 fighting men, of whom 1,685 died. On the home front, Rhode Island and the other northern states used their industrial capacity to supply the Union Army with the materials it needed to win the war. The United States Naval Academy moved to Rhode Island temporarily during the war.

In 1866, Rhode Island abolished racial segregation in the public schools throughout the state.

===Gilded Age===

The 50 years following the Civil War were a time of prosperity and affluence that author William G. McLoughlin calls &quot;Rhode Island&#x27;s halcyon era&quot;. Rhode Island was a center of the Gilded Age and provided a home or summer home to many of the country&#x27;s most prominent industrialists. This was a time of growth in textile mills and manufacturing and brought an influx of immigrants to fill those jobs, bringing population growth and urbanization. In Newport, New York&#x27;s wealthiest industrialists created a summer haven to socialize and build grand mansions. Thousands of French-Canadian, Italian, Irish, and Portuguese immigrants arrived to fill jobs in the textile and manufacturing mills in Providence, Pawtucket, Central Falls, and Woonsocket.

===World War I===
During World War I, Rhode Island furnished 28,817 soldiers, of whom 612 died. After the war, the state was hit hard by the Spanish Influenza.

In the 1920s and 1930s, rural Rhode Island saw a surge in Ku Klux Klan membership, largely in reaction to large waves of immigrants moving to the state. The Klan is believed to be responsible for burning the Watchman Industrial School in Scituate, which was a school for African-American children.

===Growth in the modern era: 1929–present===
Since the Great Depression, the Rhode Island Democratic Party has dominated local politics. Rhode Island has comprehensive health insurance for low-income children and a large social safety net. However, many urban areas still have a high rate of child poverty. Due to an influx of residents from Boston, increasing housing costs have resulted in more homelessness in Rhode Island.

The 350th Anniversary of the founding of Rhode Island was celebrated with a free concert held on the tarmac of the Quonset State Airport on August 31, 1986. Performers included Chuck Berry, Tommy James, and headliner Bob Hope.
==Geography==
Rhode Island covers an area of within the New England region of the Northeastern United States and is bordered on the north and east by Massachusetts, on the west by Connecticut, and on the south by Rhode Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean. It shares a narrow maritime border with New York State between Block Island and Long Island. The state&#x27;s mean elevation is . It is only wide and long, yet the state has a tidal shoreline on Narragansett Bay and the Atlantic Ocean of .

Rhode Island is nicknamed the Ocean State and has a number of oceanfront beaches. It is mostly flat with no real mountains, and the state&#x27;s highest natural point is Jerimoth Hill, above sea level. The state has two distinct natural regions. Eastern Rhode Island contains the lowlands of the Narragansett Bay, while Western Rhode Island forms part of the New England upland. Rhode Island&#x27;s forests are part of the Northeastern coastal forests ecoregion.

Narragansett Bay is a major feature of the state&#x27;s topography. There are more than 30 islands within the bay; the largest is Aquidneck Island, which holds the municipalities of Newport, Middletown, and Portsmouth. The second-largest island is Conanicut, and the third is Prudence. Block Island lies about off the southern coast of the mainland and separates Block Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean proper.

A rare type of rock called Cumberlandite can be found in Cumberland (the only place within the United States in which it can be found) and is the state rock. There were initially two known deposits of the mineral, but it is an ore of iron, and one of the deposits was extensively mined for its ferrous content.

=== Climate ===

Most of Rhode Island has a humid continental climate, with warm summers and cold winters. The state&#x27;s southern coastal portions are the broad transition zone into subtropical climates, with hot summers and cool winters with a mix of rain and snow. Block Island has an oceanic climate. The highest temperature recorded in Rhode Island was , recorded on August 2, 1975, in Providence. The lowest recorded temperature in Rhode Island was on February 5, 1996, in Greene. Monthly average temperatures range from a high of to a low of .

Rhode Island is vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes due to its location in New England, catching the brunt of many storms that blow up the eastern seaboard. Hurricanes that have done significant damage in the state include the 1938 New England hurricane, Hurricane Carol (1954), Hurricane Donna (1960), and Hurricane Bob (1991).

Due to the relatively flat nature of Rhode Island&#x27;s seashore, the state is vulnerable to storm surge and coastal erosion, especially as sea levels rise. 

===Cities and towns===

Rhode Island is divided into five counties but it has no county governments. The entire state is divided into 39 municipalities, which handle all local government affairs.

There are 8 cities and 31 towns in Rhode Island. Major population centers today result from historical factors; development took place predominantly along the Blackstone, Seekonk, and Providence Rivers with the advent of the water-powered mill. Providence is the base of a large metropolitan area.

The state&#x27;s 19 largest municipalities ranked by population are: 

#Providence (190,934)
#Cranston (82,934)
#Warwick (82,823)
#Pawtucket (75,604)
#East Providence (47,139)
#Woonsocket (43,240)
#Cumberland (36,405)
#Coventry (35,688)
#North Providence (34,114)
#South Kingstown (31,931)
#West Warwick (31,012)
#Johnston (29,568)
#North Kingstown (27,732)
#Newport (25,163)
#Westerly (23,359)
#Central Falls (22,583)
#Lincoln (22,529)
#Bristol (22,493)
#Smithfield (22,118)
Some of Rhode Island&#x27;s cities and towns are further partitioned into villages, in common with many other New England states. Notable villages include Kingston in the town of South Kingstown, which houses the University of Rhode Island; Wickford in the town of North Kingstown, the site of an annual international art festival; and Wakefield where the Town Hall is for the Town of South Kingstown.

==Landmarks==
The state capitol building is made of white Georgian marble. On top is the world&#x27;s fourth largest self-supported marble dome. It houses the Rhode Island Charter granted by King Charles II in 1663, the Brown University charter, and other state treasures.

The First Baptist Church of Providence is the oldest Baptist church in the Americas, founded by Roger Williams in 1638.

The first fully automated post office in the country is in Providence. There are many historic mansions in the seaside city of Newport, including The Breakers, Marble House, and Belcourt Castle. Also there is the Touro Synagogue, dedicated on December 2, 1763, considered by locals to be the first synagogue within the United States (see below for information on New York City&#x27;s claim), and still serving. The synagogue showcases the religious freedoms established by Roger Williams, as well as impressive architecture in a mix of the classic colonial and Sephardic style. The Newport Casino is a National Historic Landmark building complex that houses the International Tennis Hall of Fame and features an active grass-court tennis club.

Scenic Route 1A (known locally as Ocean Road) is in Narragansett. &quot;The Towers&quot; is also in Narragansett featuring a large stone arch. It was once the entrance to a famous Narragansett casino that burned down in 1900. The Towers now serve as an event venue and host the local Chamber of Commerce, which operates a tourist information center.

The Newport Tower has been hypothesized to be of Viking origin, although most experts believe it was a Colonial-era windmill.

==Environment==
===Environmental legislation===

On May 29, 2014, Governor Lincoln D. Chafee announced that Rhode Island was one of eight states to release a collaborative Action Plan to put 3.3 million zero-emission vehicles on its roads by 2025. The plan&#x27;s purpose is to reduce greenhouse gas and smog-causing emissions. The plan promotes zero-emissions vehicles and investments in the infrastructure to support them.

In 2014, Rhode Island received grants of $2,711,685 from the Environmental Protection Agency to clean up Brownfield sites in eight locations. The grants provided communities with funding to assess, clean up, and redevelop contaminated properties, boost local economies, and leverage jobs while protecting public health and the environment.

In 2013, the &quot;Lots of Hope&quot; program was established in the City of Providence to focus on increasing the city&#x27;s green space and local food production, improve urban neighborhoods, promote healthy lifestyles and improve environmental sustainability. Supported by a $100,000 grant, the program will partner with the City of Providence, the Southside Community Land Trust, and the Rhode Island Foundation to convert city-owned vacant lots into productive urban farms.

In 2012, Rhode Island passed bill S2277/H7412, &quot;An act relating to Health and Safety – Environmental Cleanup Objectives for Schools&quot;, informally known as the School Siting Bill. Sponsored by Senator Juan Pichardo and Representative Scott Slater, and signed into law by the governor, it made Rhode Island the first US State to prohibit school construction on Brownfield sites where toxic vapors can potentially affect indoor air quality. It also creates a public participation process whenever a city or town considers building a school on any other kind of contaminated site.

On April 14, 2021, the 2021 Act on Climate a very significant climate legislation, was signed.

==Demographics==

At the 2020 U.S. census, Rhode Island&#x27;s population was 1,097,379. The center of population of Rhode Island is in Providence County, in the city of Cranston. A corridor of population can be seen from the Providence area, stretching northwest following the Blackstone River to Woonsocket, where 19th-century mills drove industry and development.

According to HUD&#x27;s 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 1,577 homeless people in Rhode Island.

According to the 2020 census, 71.3% of the population was White (68.7% non-Hispanic white), 5.7% was Black or African American, 0.7% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.6% Asian, 0.0% Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander, 9.4% from some other race, and 9.3% from two or more races. 16.6% of the total population was of Hispanic or Latino origin (they may be of any race).

Of the people residing in Rhode Island, 58.7% were born in Rhode Island, 26.6% were born in a different state, 2.0% were born in Puerto Rico, U.S. Island areas or born abroad to American parent(s), and 12.6% were foreign born.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, , Rhode Island had an estimated population of 1,056,298, which is an increase of 1,125, or 0.10%, from the prior year and an increase of 3,731, or 0.35%, since the year 2010. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 15,220 people (that is 66,973 births minus 51,753 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 14,001 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 18,965 people, and migration within the country produced a net decrease of 4,964 people. In 2018, The top countries of origin for Rhode Island&#x27;s immigrants were the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Portugal, Cape Verde and India.

Hispanics in the state make up 12.8% of the population, predominantly Dominican, Puerto Rican, and Guatemalan populations. Rhode Island has the highest percentage of Dominican Americans in the country at 5.1% according to latest estimates, putting the state at sixth largest Dominican community in the country.

According to the 2000 U.S. census, 84% of the population aged 5 and older spoke only American English, while 8.07% spoke Spanish at home, 3.80% Portuguese, 1.96% French, 1.39% Italian and 0.78% speak other languages at home accordingly.

The state&#x27;s most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic white, has declined from 96.1% in 1970 to 76.5% in 2011. In 2011, 40.3% of Rhode Island&#x27;s children under the age of one belonged to racial or ethnic minority groups, meaning they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white.

6.1% of Rhode Island&#x27;s population were reported as under 5, 23.6% under 18, and 14.5% were 65 or older. Females made up approximately 52% of the population.

According to the 2010–2015 American Community Survey, the largest ancestry groups were Irish (18.3%), Italian (18.0%), English (10.5%), French (10.4%), and Portuguese (9.3%). Rhode Island has some of the highest percentages of Irish Americans and Italian Americans. Italian Americans make up a plurality in central and southern Providence County and French-Canadian Americans form a large part of northern Providence County. Irish Americans have a strong presence in Newport and Kent counties. Americans of English ancestry still have a presence in the state as well, especially in Washington County, and are often referred to as &quot;Swamp Yankees&quot;.

Rhode Island has a notable Lusophone community, having a higher percentage of Americans of Portuguese ancestry than any other state, including Portuguese Americans and Cape Verdean Americans. Additionally, the state also has the highest percentage of Liberian immigrants, with more than 15,000 residing in the state. African immigrants, including those from Cape Verde and Liberia, form significant and growing communities in Rhode Island. Rhode Island is one of the few states where Black people of recent foreign origin outnumber Black people of multigenerational American origin (African Americans). Rhode Island also has a sizable Asian community. There is one federally recognized tribe in Rhode Island, the Narragansett Indian Tribe.

Although Rhode Island has the smallest land area of all 50 states, it has the second highest population density, second to that of New Jersey.

===Birth data===
*Since 2016, data for births of White Hispanic origin are not collected, but included in one &quot;Hispanic&quot; group; persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race.

===Religion===

A Pew survey of Rhode Island residents&#x27; religious self-identification in 2014 showed the following distribution of affiliations: Catholic 42%, Protestant 30%, Jewish 1%, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses 2%, Buddhism 1%, Mormonism 1%, Hinduism 1%, and Non-religious 20%. The largest Christian denominations as of 2010 were the Catholic Church with 456,598 adherents, the Episcopal Church with 19,377, the American Baptist Churches USA with 15,220, and the United Methodist Church with 6,901 adherents.

Rhode Island has had the highest proportion of Catholic residents of any state according to a study in 2000, mainly due to large Irish, Italian, and French-Canadian immigration in the past; recently, significant Portuguese and various Hispanic or Latino communities have also been established in the state. Though it has the highest overall Catholic percentage of any state, none of Rhode Island&#x27;s individual counties ranks among the 10 most Catholic in the United States, as Catholics are evenly spread throughout the state.

According to the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) in 2020, 67% of the population were Christian, spread among evangelical and mainline Protestantism, and Roman Catholicism. In 2022, the Public Religion Research Institute revealed 72% of the population were Christian.

Rhode Island&#x27;s Jewish community, centered in the Providence area, emerged during a wave of Jewish immigration predominantly from Eastern Europeans shtetls between 1880 and 1920. The presence of the Touro Synagogue in Newport, the oldest existing synagogue in the United States, emphasizes that these second-wave immigrants did not create Rhode Island&#x27;s first Jewish community; a comparatively smaller wave of Spanish and Portuguese Jews immigrated to Newport during the colonial era. In 2022, they made up 2% of the state&#x27;s population.

The religiously unaffiliated since 2014 were 20% of the population, though the separate study by the Public Religion Research Institute determined the irreligious increased to 29% of the adult population. In 2022, the religiously unaffiliated declined to 24% of the population.

=== Native American tribes ===
Today, many inhabitants of Rhode Island identify as being Native American alone (6,058 people in 2010 census and 7,385 in 2020) or Native American in combination with one or more other races (8,336 people in 2010 census and 15,972 in 2020). Many inhabitants of Rhode Island also reported belonging to tribes in 2010 census, the largest of which were the Narragansett (2,820 people), the Cherokee (987), the Wampanoag (559) and the Pequot (424). Other tribes included the Iroquois (278), the Micmac (101), the Abenaki (100), the Nipmuc (99) and more.

==Economy==

The Rhode Island economy had a colonial base in fishing.

The Blackstone River Valley was a major contributor to the American Industrial Revolution. It was in Pawtucket that Samuel Slater set up Slater Mill in 1793, using the waterpower of the Blackstone River to power his cotton mill. For a while, Rhode Island was one of the leaders in textiles. However, with the Great Depression, most textile factories relocated to southern U.S. states. The textile industry still constitutes a part of the Rhode Island economy but does not have the same power.

Other important industries in Rhode Island&#x27;s past included toolmaking, costume jewelry, and silverware. An interesting by-product of Rhode Island&#x27;s industrial history is the number of abandoned factories, many of which are now condominiums, museums, offices, and low-income and elderly housing. Today, much of Rhode Island&#x27;s economy is based on services, particularly healthcare and education, and still manufacturing to some extent. The state&#x27;s nautical history continues in the 21st century in the form of nuclear submarine construction.

Per the 2013 American Communities Survey, Rhode Island has the highest paid elementary school teachers in the country, with an average salary of $75,028 (adjusted to inflation).

The headquarters of Citizens Financial Group, the 14th largest bank in the United States, is in Providence. The Fortune 500 companies CVS Caremark and Textron are based in Woonsocket and Providence, respectively. FM Global, GTECH Corporation, Hasbro, American Power Conversion, Nortek, and Amica Mutual Insurance are all Fortune 1000 companies based in Rhode Island.

Rhode Island&#x27;s 2000 total gross state production was $46.18 billion (adjusted to inflation), placing it 45th in the nation. Its 2000 &quot;per capita&quot; personal income was $41,484 (adjusted to inflation), 16th in the nation. Rhode Island has the lowest level of energy consumption per capita of any state. Additionally, Rhode Island is rated as the 5th most energy efficient state in the country. In December 2012, the state&#x27;s unemployment rate was 10.2%. This has gradually reduced to 3.5% in November 2019, however, the coronavirus pandemic brought the unemployment rate to a high of 18.1% in April 2020. This has since reduced to 10.5% in September 2020 and is projected to further decrease to 7% in October 2020.

Health services are Rhode Island&#x27;s largest industry. Second is tourism, supporting 39,000 jobs, with tourism-related sales at $4.56 billion (adjusted to inflation) in the year 2000. The third-largest industry is manufacturing. Its industrial outputs are submarine construction, shipbuilding, costume jewelry, fabricated metal products, electrical equipment, machinery, and boatbuilding. Rhode Island&#x27;s agricultural outputs are nursery stock, vegetables, dairy products, and eggs. The largest single product is milk, which in 2017 totaled $4,563,000 in sales.

Rhode Island&#x27;s taxes were appreciably higher than those of neighboring states, because Rhode Island&#x27;s income tax was based on 25% of the payer&#x27;s federal income tax payment. Former Governor Donald Carcieri claimed the higher tax rate had an inhibitory effect on business growth in the state and called for reductions to increase the competitiveness of the state&#x27;s business environment. In 2010, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed a new state income tax structure that Governor Carcieri signed into law on June 9, 2010. The income tax overhaul has made Rhode Island competitive with other New England states by lowering its maximum tax rate to 5.99% and reducing the number of tax brackets to three. The state&#x27;s first income tax was enacted in 1971.

==Transportation==
===Bus===

The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) operates statewide intra- and intercity bus transport from its hubs at Kennedy Plaza in Providence, Pawtucket, and Newport. RIPTA bus routes serve 38 of Rhode Island&#x27;s 39 cities and towns. (New Shoreham on Block Island is not served). RIPTA operates 58 routes, including daytime trolley service (using trolley-style replica buses) in Providence and Newport.

===Ferry===
From 2000 through 2008, RIPTA offered seasonal ferry service linking Providence and Newport (already connected by highway) funded by grant money from the United States Department of Transportation. Though the service was popular with residents and tourists, RIPTA was unable to continue after the federal funding ended. Service was discontinued . The service resumed in 2016 and has been successful. The privately run Block Island Ferry links Block Island with Newport and Narragansett with traditional and fast-ferry service, while the Prudence Island Ferry connects Bristol with Prudence Island. Private ferry services also link several Rhode Island communities with ports in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New York.

===Rail===
The MBTA Commuter Rail&#x27;s Providence/Stoughton Line links Providence and T. F. Green Airport with Boston&#x27;s South Station, with an intermediate stop at Pawtucket/Central Falls and several stations in Massachusetts. The line was later extended southward to Wickford Junction, with service beginning April 23, 2012. The state hopes to extend the MBTA line to Kingston and Westerly, as well as explore the possibility of extending Connecticut&#x27;s Shore Line East to T.F. Green Airport. Amtrak&#x27;s Acela Express stops at Providence Station (the only Acela stop in Rhode Island), linking Providence to other cities in the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Regional service makes stops at Providence Station, Kingston, and Westerly. 

Rhode Island is one of four states to have high-speed Northeast Corridor tracks capable of 165 mph. This was due to the fact that in the 1990s, Amtrak upgraded the NEC north of New Haven, CT to get it ready for the high-speed &quot;Acela Express&quot; trains and to extend electrified Northeast Corridor services to Boston.

===Aviation===
Rhode Island&#x27;s primary airport for passenger and cargo transport is T. F. Green Airport in Warwick, though Rhode Islanders who wish to travel internationally on direct flights and those who seek a greater availability of flights and destinations often fly through Logan International Airport in Boston.

===Limited access highways===

Interstate 95 (I-95) runs southwest to northeast across the state, linking Rhode Island with other states along the East Coast. I-295 functions as a partial beltway encircling Providence to the west. I-195 provides a limited-access highway connection from Providence (and Connecticut and New York via I-95) to Cape Cod. Initially built as the easternmost link in the (now cancelled) extension of I-84 from Hartford, Connecticut, a portion of U.S. Route 6 (US 6) through northern Rhode Island is limited-access and links I-295 with downtown Providence.

Several Rhode Island highways extend the state&#x27;s limited-access highway network. Route 4 is a major north–south freeway linking Providence and Warwick (via I-95) with suburban and beach communities along Narragansett Bay. Route 10 is an urban connector linking downtown Providence with Cranston and Johnston. Route 37 is an important east–west freeway through Cranston and Warwick and links I-95 with I-295. Route 99 links Woonsocket with Providence (via Route 146). Route 146 travels through the Blackstone Valley, linking Providence and I-95 with Worcester, Massachusetts and the Massachusetts Turnpike. Route 403 links Route 4 with Quonset Point.

Several bridges cross Narragansett Bay connecting Aquidneck Island and Conanicut Island to the mainland, most notably the Claiborne Pell Newport Bridge and the Jamestown-Verrazano Bridge.

===Bicycle paths===

The East Bay Bike Path stretches from Providence to Bristol along the eastern shore of Narragansett Bay, while the Blackstone River Bikeway will eventually link Providence and Worcester. In 2011, Rhode Island completed work on a marked on-road bicycle path through Pawtucket and Providence, connecting the East Bay Bike Path with the Blackstone River Bikeway, completing a bicycle route through the eastern side of the state. The William C. O&#x27;Neill Bike Path (commonly known as the South County Bike Path) is an path through South Kingstown and Narragansett. The Washington Secondary Bike Path stretches from Cranston to Coventry, and the Ten Mile River Greenway path runs through East Providence and Pawtucket.

===Future===
In late 2019, the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority released a draft of the Rhode Island Transit Master Plan, documenting and describing a variety of proposed improvements and additions to be made to the state&#x27;s public transit network by 2040. Several different proposals were offered and still under consideration as of December 2020, including implementation of a bus rapid transit system, express bus routes, expansion of Amtrak and MBTA services throughout the state, and construction of a new light rail network through downtown Providence.

==Culture==

===Local accent===

Some Rhode Islanders speak with the distinctive, non-rhotic, traditional Rhode Island accent linguists describe as a cross between New York City and Boston accents (e.g., &quot;water&quot; sounds like &quot;watuh&quot; ). Many Rhode Islanders distinguish a strong &quot;aw&quot; sound (i.e., resist the cot–caught merger of Boston) much like one might hear in New Jersey or New York City; for example, the word &quot;coffee&quot; is pronounced . Rhode Islanders sometimes refer to drinking fountains as &quot;bubblers&quot;, milkshakes as &quot;cabinets&quot;, and overstuffed foot-long sandwiches (of whatever kind) as &quot;grinders&quot;.

===Food and beverages===
Rhode Island, like the rest of New England, has a tradition of clam chowder. Both the white New England and the red Manhattan varieties are popular, but there is also a unique clear-broth chowder known as &quot;Rhode Island Clam Chowder&quot; available in many restaurants. A culinary tradition in Rhode Island is the &quot;clam cake&quot; (also known as a clam fritter outside of Rhode Island), a deep fried ball of buttery dough with chopped bits of clam inside. They are sold by the half-dozen or dozen in most seafood restaurants around the state, and the quintessential summer meal in Rhode Island is chowder and clam cakes.

The quahog is a large local clam usually used in a chowder. It is also ground and mixed with stuffing or spicy minced sausage, and then baked in its shell to form a &quot;stuffie&quot;. Calamari (squid) is sliced into rings and fried as an appetizer in most Italian restaurants, typically served Sicilian-style with sliced banana peppers and marinara sauce on the side. (In 2014, calamari became the official state appetizer.) Clams Casino originated in Rhode Island, invented by Julius Keller, the maître d&#x27; in the original Casino next to the seaside Towers in Narragansett. Clams Casino resemble the beloved stuffed quahog but are generally made with the smaller littleneck or cherrystone clam and are unique in their use of bacon as a topping.

The official state drink of Rhode Island is &quot;coffee milk&quot;, a beverage created by mixing milk with coffee syrup. This unique syrup was invented in the state and is sold in almost all Rhode Island supermarkets, as well as its bordering states. Johnnycakes have been a Rhode Island staple since Colonial times, made with corn meal and water then pan-fried much like pancakes.

Submarine sandwiches are called &quot;grinders&quot; throughout Rhode Island, and the Italian grinder, made with cold cuts such as ham, prosciutto, capicola, salami, and Provolone cheese, is especially popular. Linguiça or chouriço is a spicy Portuguese sausage often served with peppers and eaten with hearty bread.

===Rhode Island state symbols===
===In popular culture===

The Farrelly brothers and Seth MacFarlane depict Rhode Island in popular culture, often making comedic parodies of the state. MacFarlane&#x27;s television series &quot;Family Guy&quot; is based in a fictional Rhode Island city named Quahog, and notable local events and celebrities are regularly lampooned. Peter Griffin is seen working at the Pawtucket brewery, and other state locations are mentioned.

The 1956 film &quot;High Society&quot; (starring Bing Crosby, Grace Kelly, and Frank Sinatra) was set in Newport, Rhode Island.

The 1974 film adaptation of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; was also filmed in Newport.

Jacqueline Bouvier and John F. Kennedy were married at St. Mary&#x27;s church in Newport. Their reception took place at Hammersmith Farm, the Bouvier summer home in Newport.

Cartoonist Don Bousquet, a state icon, has made a career out of Rhode Island culture, drawing Rhode Island-themed gags in &quot;The Providence Journal&quot; and &quot;Yankee&quot; magazine. These cartoons have been reprinted in the &quot;Quahog&quot; series of paperbacks (&quot;I Brake for Quahogs&quot;, &quot;Beware of the Quahog&quot;, and &quot;The Quahog Walks Among Us&quot;.) Bousquet has also collaborated with humorist and &quot;Providence Journal&quot; columnist Mark Patinkin on two books: &quot;The Rhode Island Dictionary&quot; and &quot;The Rhode Island Handbook&quot;.

The 1998 film &quot;Meet Joe Black&quot; was filmed at Aldrich Mansion in the Warwick Neck area of Warwick.

&quot;Body of Proof&quot;″s first season was filmed entirely in Rhode Island. The show premiered on March 29, 2011.

The 2007 Steve Carell and Dane Cook film &quot;Dan in Real Life&quot; was filmed in various coastal towns in the state. The sunset scene with the entire family on the beach takes place at Napatree Point.

&quot;Jersey Shore&quot; star Pauly D filmed part of his spin-off &quot;The Pauly D Project&quot; in his hometown of Johnston.

The Comedy Central cable television series &quot;Another Period&quot; is set in Newport during the Gilded Age.

===Notable firsts in Rhode Island===
Rhode Island has been the first in a number of initiatives. The Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations enacted the first law prohibiting slavery in America on May 18, 1652.

The first act of armed rebellion in America against the British Crown was the boarding and burning of the Revenue Schooner &quot;HMS Gaspée&quot; in Narragansett Bay on June 10, 1772. The idea of a Continental Congress was first proposed at a town meeting in Providence on May 17, 1774. Rhode Island elected the first delegates (Stephen Hopkins and Samuel Ward) to the Continental Congress on June 15, 1774. The Rhode Island General Assembly created the first standing army in the colonies (1,500 men) on April 22, 1775. On June 15, 1775, the first naval engagement took place in the American Revolution between an American sloop commanded by Capt. Abraham Whipple and an armed tender of the British Frigate &quot;Rose&quot;. The tender was chased aground and captured. Later in June, the General Assembly created the American Navy when it commissioned the sloops &quot;Katy&quot; and , armed with 24 guns and commanded by Abraham Whipple who was promoted to Commodore. Rhode Island was the first Colony to declare independence from Britain on May 4, 1776.

Slater Mill in Pawtucket was the first commercially successful cotton-spinning mill with a fully mechanized power system in America and was the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution in the US. The oldest Fourth of July parade in the country is still held annually in Bristol, Rhode Island. The first Baptist church in America was founded in Providence in 1638. Ann Smith Franklin of the Newport &quot;Mercury&quot; was the first female newspaper editor in America (August 22, 1762). Touro Synagogue is the oldest synagogue in America, founded in Newport in 1763.

Pelham Street in Newport was the first in America to be illuminated by gaslight in 1806. The first strike in the United States in which women participated occurred in Pawtucket in 1824. Watch Hill has the nation&#x27;s oldest flying horses carousel that has been in continuous operation since 1850. The motion picture machine was patented in Providence on April 23, 1867. The first lunch wagon in America was introduced in Providence in 1872. The first nine-hole golf course in America was completed in Newport in 1890. The first state health laboratory was established in Providence on September 1, 1894. The Rhode Island State House was the first building with an all-marble dome to be built in the United States (1895–1901). The first automobile race on a track was held in Cranston on September 7, 1896. The first automobile parade was held in Newport on September 7, 1899, on the grounds of Belcourt Castle.

===Miscellaneous local culture===
Rhode Island is nicknamed &quot;The Ocean State&quot;, and the nautical nature of Rhode Island&#x27;s geography pervades its culture. Newport Harbor, in particular, holds many pleasure boats. In the lobby of T. F. Green, the state&#x27;s main airport, is a large life-sized sailboat, and the state&#x27;s license plates depict an ocean wave or a sailboat.
The large number of beaches in Washington County lures many Rhode Islanders south for summer vacation.

The state constitution protects shore access, including swimming and gathering of seaweed. The 1982 Rhode Island Supreme Court decision in &quot;State v. Ibbison&quot; defines the end of private land as the mean high tide line, which is difficult to determine in day-to-day activities, and has resulted in beach access conflicts. Underfunding of the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council has resulted in lax enforcement against encroachment on public access and building of illegal structures.

The state was notorious for organized crime activity from the 1950s into the 1990s when the Patriarca crime family held sway over most of New England from its Providence headquarters.

Rhode Islanders developed a unique style of architecture in the 17th century called the stone-ender.

Rhode Island is the only state to still celebrate Victory over Japan Day, which is officially named &quot;Victory Day&quot; but is sometimes referred to as &quot;VJ Day&quot;. It is celebrated on the second Monday in August.

Nibbles Woodaway, more commonly referred to as &quot;The Big Blue Bug&quot;, is a 58-foot-long termite mascot for a Providence extermination business. Since its construction in 1980, it has been featured in several movies and television shows, and has come to be recognized as a cultural landmark by many locals. In more recent times, the Big Blue Bug has been given a mask to remind locals and visitors to mask-up during the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Music===

On September 2, 1977, music icons The Beach Boys performed a concert at Narragansett Park in Pawtucket, Rhode Island attended by 40,000 people, the largest concert audience in Rhode Island history. In 2017, music historians Al Gomes and Connie Watrous of Big Noise were successful in getting the street where the concert stage stood (510 Narragansett Park Drive in Pawtucket, RI) officially renamed as &quot;Beach Boys Way&quot;.

In April of 1986, the music charity Bandwagon was established in Rhode Island. On May 11, 1986, a 150-person celebrity chorus consisting of musicians, journalists (including MTV Networks executive producer Bill Flanagan), TV broadcasters, politicians (including members of the United States Congress), and the heads of human service agencies joined together at the recording studio Normandy Sound in Warren, RI to record the charity single “A Piece of Our Hearts.” Bandwagon’s goal was to raise money for American agencies that aid the hungry and homeless and elevate awareness of the plight of the poor in America. Because of its efforts, the project received national recognition when Bandwagon went on to win the coveted Jefferson Award from the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Foundation for Outstanding Public Service, joining fellow recipients Oprah Winfrey, President Jimmy Carter, Paul Newman, and Harry Belafonte.

===Sports===

====Professional====
Rhode Island is currently home to two professional minor league teams, one being the Providence Bruins ice hockey team of the American Hockey League, who are a top-level minor league affiliate of the Boston Bruins. They play in the Amica Mutual Pavilion in Providence and won the AHL&#x27;s Calder Cup during the 1998–99 AHL season. The other is Rhode Island FC, a soccer team that began competing in the second tier USL Championship in 2024 at Beirne Stadium located within Bryant University, awaiting the completion of the soccer-specific Tidewater Landing Stadium in Pawtucket in time for the 2025 season.
The Pawtucket Red Sox baseball team was a Triple-A International League affiliate of the Boston Red Sox from 1973 to 2020. They played at McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket and had won four league titles, the Governors&#x27; Cup, in 1973, 1984, 2012, and 2014. McCoy Stadium also has the distinction of being home to the longest professional baseball game ever played – 33 innings.

The Providence Reds were a hockey team that played in the Canadian-American Hockey League (CAHL) from 1926 to 1936, and the American Hockey League (AHL) from 1936 to 1977, the last season of which they played as the Rhode Island Reds. The team won the Calder Cup in 1938, 1940, 1949, and 1956. The Reds played at the Rhode Island Auditorium, on North Main Street in Providence, Rhode Island from 1926 through 1972, when the team affiliated with the New York Rangers and moved into the newly built Providence Civic Center. The team name came from the state bird, a rooster known as the Rhode Island Red. They moved to New York in 1977, then to Connecticut in 1997, and are now called the Hartford Wolf Pack.

The Reds are the oldest continuously operating minor-league hockey franchise in North America, having fielded a team in one form or another since 1926 in the CAHL. It is also the only AHL franchise to have never missed a season. The AHL returned to Providence in 1992 in the form of the Providence Bruins.
Before the great expansion of athletic teams all over the country, Providence and Rhode Island in general played a great role in supporting teams. The Providence Grays won the first World Championship in baseball history in 1884. The team played their home games at the old Messer Street Field in Providence. The Grays played in the National League from 1878 to 1885. They defeated the New York Metropolitans of the American Association in a best of five-game series at the Polo Grounds in New York. Providence won three straight games to become the first champions in major league baseball history. Babe Ruth played for the minor league Providence Grays of 1914 and hit his only official minor league home run for them before the Grays&#x27; parent club, the Boston Red Stockings, recalled him.

Rhode Island has deep history with the sport of soccer where the sport was played as early as 1886 when the state&#x27;s first organized league would be founded, known as the Rhode Island Football Association (RIFA). One of their teams, the Pawtucket Free Wanderers, would establish themselves as a regional power and win the American Cup in 1893. The first championship game of the U.S. Open Cup was also held in 1914 in Pawtucket&#x27;s Coates Field to a crowd of 10,000. Later, a team known as Pawtucket Rangers F.C. would win the 1941 edition of the U.S. Open Cup (then National Challenge Cup). The Rhode Island Oceaneers would later be founded, and went on to win the 1974 American Soccer League championship. Other former semiprofessional soccer teams of the modern era include the Rhode Island Stingrays of the USL Premier Development League, and the Rhode Island Reds of the National Premier Soccer League, with both leagues regarded as the fourth tier of American soccer.

The now-defunct professional football team known as the Providence Steamrollers won the 1928 NFL title. They played in a 10,000 person stadium called the Cycledrome. An unrelated basketball team also known as the Providence Steamrollers played in the Basketball Association of America, which would become the National Basketball Association.

Rhode Island&#x27;s only rugby league team was the Rhode Island Rebellion, a semi-professional team that was a founding member of the USA Rugby League, which was at the time the top competition in the United States for the sport of rugby league. The Rebellion played their home games at Classical High School in Providence.

====Collegiate and amateur sports====

There are four NCAA Division I schools in Rhode Island. All four schools compete in different conferences. The Brown University Bears compete in the Ivy League, the Bryant University Bulldogs compete in the America East Conference, the Providence College Friars compete in the Big East Conference, and the University of Rhode Island Rams compete in the Atlantic 10 Conference. Three of the schools&#x27; football teams compete in the Football Championship Subdivision, the second-highest level of college football in the United States. Brown plays FCS football in the Ivy League, Bryant plays FCS football in the Big South Conference before that league merges its football operations with those of the Ohio Valley Conference in 2023, and Rhode Island plays FCS football in CAA Football, the technically separate football league of the Colonial Athletic Association. All four Division I schools in the state compete in an intrastate all-sports competition known as the Ocean State Cup, with Bryant winning the most recent cup in 2011–12 academic year.

From 1930 to 1983, America&#x27;s Cup races were sailed off Newport, and the extreme-sport X Games and Gravity Games were founded and hosted in the state&#x27;s capital city.

The International Tennis Hall of Fame is in Newport at the Newport Casino, site of the first U.S. National Championships in 1881. The Hall of Fame and Museum were established in 1954 by Jimmy Van Alen as &quot;a shrine to the ideals of the game&quot;.

Rhode Island is also home to the headquarters of the governing body for youth rugby league in the United States, the American Youth Rugby League Association or AYRLA. The AYRLA has started the first-ever Rugby League youth competition in Providence Middle Schools, a program at the RI Training School, in addition to starting the first High School Competition in the US in Providence Public High School.

==Government==
The capital of Rhode Island is Providence. The state&#x27;s governor is Daniel McKee (D), and the lieutenant governor is Sabina Matos (D). Gina Raimondo became Rhode Island&#x27;s first female governor with a plurality of the vote in the November 2014 state elections. Its United States senators are Jack Reed (D) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D). Rhode Island&#x27;s two United States representatives are Gabe Amo (D-1) and Seth Magaziner (D-2). &quot;See congressional districts map.&quot; Rhode Island is one of a few states that do not have an official governor&#x27;s residence. &quot;See List of Rhode Island Governors.&quot;

The state legislature is the Rhode Island General Assembly, consisting of the 75-member House of Representatives and the 38-member Senate. The Democratic Party dominates both houses of the bicameral body; the Republican Party&#x27;s presence is minor in the state government, with Republicans holding a handful of seats in both the Senate and House of Representatives.

==Elections==


















Rhode Island&#x27;s population barely crosses the threshold beyond the minimum of three for additional votes in both the federal House of Representatives and Electoral College; it is well represented relative to its population, with the eighth-highest number of electoral votes and second-highest number of House Representatives per resident. Based on its area, Rhode Island has the highest density of electoral votes of any state.

Federally, Rhode Island is a reliably Democratic state during presidential elections, usually supporting the Democratic presidential nominee. The state voted for the Republican presidential candidate until 1908. Since then, it has voted for the Republican nominee for president seven times, and the Democratic nominee 17 times. The last 16 presidential elections in Rhode Island have resulted in the Democratic Party winning the Ocean State&#x27;s Electoral College votes 12 times. In the 1980 presidential election, Rhode Island was one of six states to vote against Republican Ronald Reagan. Reagan was the last Republican to win any of the state&#x27;s counties in a Presidential election until Donald Trump won Kent County in 2016. In 1988, George H. W. Bush won over 40% of the state&#x27;s popular vote, something no Republican has done since.

Rhode Island was the Democrats&#x27; leading state in 1960, 1964, 1968, 1988 and 2000, and second-best in 1968, 1972, 1996, and 2004. Rhode Island&#x27;s most one-sided Presidential election result was in 1964, with over 80% of Rhode Island&#x27;s votes going for Lyndon B. Johnson. In 2004, Rhode Island gave John Kerry more than a 20-percentage-point margin of victory (the third-highest of any state), with 59.4% of its vote. All but three of Rhode Island&#x27;s 39 cities and towns voted for the Democratic candidate. The exceptions were East Greenwich, West Greenwich, and Scituate. In 2008, Rhode Island gave Barack Obama a 28-percentage-point margin of victory (the third-highest of any state), with 63% of its vote. All but one of Rhode Island&#x27;s 39 cities and towns voted for the Democratic candidate (the exception being Scituate).

In a 2020 study, Rhode Island was ranked as the 19th easiest state for citizens to vote in.

==Legislation and taxes==
Rhode Island is one of 21 states that have abolished capital punishment; it was second do so, just after Michigan, and carried out its last execution in the 1840s. Rhode Island was the second to last state to make prostitution illegal. Until November 2009 Rhode Island law made prostitution legal provided it took place indoors. In a 2009 study Rhode Island was listed as the 9th safest state in the country.

In 2011, Rhode Island became the third state in the United States to pass legislation to allow the use of medical marijuana. On May 25, 2022, Rhode Island fully legalized recreational use of marijuana, becoming the nineteenth state to do so. Additionally, the Rhode Island General Assembly passed legislation that allowed civil unions which Governor Lincoln Chafee signed into law on July 2, 2011. Rhode Island became the eighth state to fully recognize either same-sex marriage or civil unions. Same-sex marriage became legal on May 2, 2013, and took effect August 1.

Rhode Island has some of the highest taxes in the country, particularly its property taxes, ranking seventh in local and state taxes, and sixth in real estate taxes.

<text>Rock and roll (often written as rock &amp; roll, rock-n-roll, and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll) is a genre of popular music that evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s. It originated from African American music such as jazz, rhythm and blues, boogie-woogie, electric blues, gospel, and jump blues, as well as country music. While rock and roll&#x27;s formative elements can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until 1954.

According to the journalist Greg Kot, &quot;rock and roll&quot; refers to a style of popular music originating in the United States in the 1950s. By the mid-1960s, rock and roll had developed into &quot;the more encompassing international style known as rock music, though the latter also continued to be known in many circles as rock and roll&quot;. For the purpose of differentiation, this article deals with the first definition.

In the earliest rock and roll styles, either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument. These instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by the electric guitar in the mid-to-late 1950s. The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated backbeat, almost always provided by a snare drum. Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or more electric guitars (one lead, one rhythm) and a double bass (string bass). After the mid-1950s, electric bass guitars (&quot;Fender bass&quot;) and drum kits became popular in classic rock.

Rock and roll had a profound influence on contemporary American lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language, and is often portrayed in movies, fan magazines, and on television. Some people believe that the music had a positive influence on the civil rights movement, because of its widespread appeal to both Black American and White American teenagers.

== Terminology ==

The term &quot;rock and roll&quot; is defined by Greg Kot in &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; as the music that originated in the mid-1950s and later developed &quot;into the more encompassing international style known as rock music&quot;. The term is sometimes also used as synonymous with &quot;rock music&quot; and is defined as such in some dictionaries.

The phrase &quot;rocking and rolling&quot; originally described the movement of a ship on the ocean, but by the early 20th century was used both to describe the spiritual fervor of black church rituals and as a sexual analogy. A retired Welsh seaman named William Fender can be heard singing the phrase &quot;rock and roll&quot; when describing a sexual encounter in his performance of the traditional song &quot;The Baffled Knight&quot; to the folklorist James Madison Carpenter in the early 1930s, which he would have learned at sea in the 1800s; the recording can be heard on the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library website.

Various gospel, blues and swing recordings used the phrase before it became widely popular. &quot;Bosom of Abraham&quot;, an African-American spiritual that was documented no later than 1867 (just after the Civil War), uses the phrase &quot;rock my soul&quot; frequently in a religious sense; this song was later recorded by musicians from various genres, including various gospel musicians and groups (including The Jordanaires), Louis Armstrong (jazz/swing), Lonnie Donegan (skiffle), and Elvis Presley (rock and roll/pop/country). Blues singer Trixie Smith recorded &quot;My [Man Rocks Me with One Steady Roll&quot;] in 1922. It was used in 1940s recordings and reviews of what became known as &quot;rhythm and blues&quot; music aimed at a black audience. Huey &quot;Piano&quot; Smith credits Cha Cha Hogan, a jump-blues shouter and comic in New Orleans, with popularizing the term in his 1950 song &quot;My Walking Baby&quot;.

In 1934, the song &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; by the Boswell Sisters appeared in the film &quot;Transatlantic Merry-Go-Round&quot;. In 1942, before the concept of rock and roll had been defined, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine columnist Maurie Orodenker started to use the term to describe upbeat recordings such as &quot;Rock Me&quot; by Sister Rosetta Tharpe; her style on that recording was described as &quot;rock-and-roll spiritual singing&quot;. By 1943, the &quot;Rock and Roll Inn&quot; in South Merchantville, New Jersey, was established as a music venue. In 1951, Cleveland, Ohio, disc jockey Alan Freed began playing this music style, and referring to it as &quot;rock and roll&quot; on his mainstream radio program, which popularized the phrase.

Several sources suggest that Freed found the term, used as a synonym for sexual intercourse, on the record &quot;Sixty Minute Man&quot; by Billy Ward and his Dominoes. The lyrics include the line, &quot;I rock &#x27;em, roll &#x27;em all night long&quot;. Freed did not acknowledge the suggestion about that source in interviews, and explained the term as follows: &quot;Rock &#x27;n roll is really swing with a modern name. It began on the levees and plantations, took in folk songs, and features blues and rhythm&quot;.

In discussing Alan Freed&#x27;s contribution to the genre, two significant sources emphasized the importance of African-American rhythm and blues. Greg Harris, then the executive director of the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame, offered this comment to CNN: &quot;Freed&#x27;s role in breaking down racial barriers in U.S. pop culture in the 1950s, by leading white and black kids to listen to the same music, put the radio personality &#x27;at the vanguard&#x27; and made him &#x27;a really important figure. After Freed was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the organization&#x27;s Web site offered this comment: &quot;He became internationally known for promoting African-American rhythm and blues music on the radio in the United States and Europe under the name of rock and roll&quot;.

Not often acknowledged in the history of rock and roll, Todd Storz, the owner of radio station KOWH in Omaha, Nebraska, was the first to adopt the Top 40 format (in 1953), playing only the most popular records in rotation. His station, and the numerous others which adopted the concept, helped to promote the genre: by the mid 50s, the playlist included artists such as &quot;Presley, Lewis, Haley, Berry and Domino&quot;.

== Early rock and roll ==

=== Origins ===
The origins of rock and roll have been fiercely debated by commentators and historians of music. There is general agreement that it arose in the Southern United States – a region that would produce most of the major early rock and roll acts – through the meeting of various influences that embodied a merging of the African musical tradition with European instrumentation. The migration of many former slaves and their descendants to major urban centers such as St. Louis, Memphis, New York City, Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, and Buffalo meant that black and white residents were living in close proximity in larger numbers than ever before, and as a result heard each other&#x27;s music and even began to emulate each other&#x27;s fashions. Radio stations that made white and black forms of music available to both groups, the development and spread of the gramophone record, and African-American musical styles such as jazz and swing which were taken up by white musicians, aided this process of &quot;cultural collision&quot;.

The immediate roots of rock and roll lay in the rhythm and blues, then called &quot;race music&quot;, in combination with either boogie-woogie and shouting gospel or with country music of the 1940s and 1950s. Particularly significant influences were jazz, blues, gospel, country, and folk. Commentators differ in their views of which of these forms were most important and the degree to which the new music was a re-branding of African-American rhythm and blues for a white market, or a new hybrid of black and white forms.

In the 1930s, jazz, and particularly swing, both in urban-based dance bands and blues-influenced country swing (Jimmie Rodgers, Moon Mullican and other similar singers), were among the first music to present African-American sounds for a predominantly white audience. One particularly noteworthy example of a jazz song with recognizably rock and roll elements is Big Joe Turner with pianist Pete Johnson&#x27;s 1938 single &quot;Roll &#x27;Em Pete&quot;, which is regarded as an important precursor of rock and roll. The 1940s saw the increased use of blaring horns (including saxophones), shouted lyrics and boogie-woogie beats in jazz-based music. During and immediately after World War II, with shortages of fuel and limitations on audiences and available personnel, large jazz bands were less economical and tended to be replaced by smaller combos, using guitars, bass and drums. In the same period, particularly on the West Coast and in the Midwest, the development of jump blues, with its guitar riffs, prominent beats and shouted lyrics, prefigured many later developments. In the documentary film &quot;Hail! Hail! Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, Keith Richards proposes that Chuck Berry developed his brand of rock and roll by transposing the familiar two-note lead line of jump blues piano directly to the electric guitar, creating what is instantly recognizable as rock guitar. This proposal by Richards neglects the black guitarists who did the same thing before Berry, such as Goree Carter, Gatemouth Brown, and the originator of the style, T-Bone Walker. Country boogie and Chicago electric blues supplied many of the elements that would be seen as characteristic of rock and roll. Inspired by electric blues, Chuck Berry introduced an aggressive guitar sound to rock and roll, and established the electric guitar as its centerpiece, adapting his rock band instrumentation from the basic blues band instrumentation of a lead guitar, second chord instrument, bass and drums. In 2017, Robert Christgau declared that &quot;Chuck Berry did in fact invent rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, explaining that this artist &quot;came the closest of any single figure to being the one who put all the essential pieces together&quot;.

Rock and roll arrived at a time of considerable technological change, soon after the development of the electric guitar, amplifier, 45 rpm record and modern condenser microphones. There were also changes in the record industry, with the rise of independent labels like Atlantic, Sun and Chess servicing niche audiences and a similar rise of radio stations that played their music. It was the realization that relatively affluent white teenagers were listening to this music that led to the development of what was to be defined as rock and roll as a distinct genre. Because the development of rock and roll was an evolutionary process, no single record can be identified as unambiguously &quot;the first&quot; rock and roll record. Contenders for the title of &quot;first rock and roll record&quot; include Sister Rosetta Tharpe&#x27;s &quot;Strange Things Happening Every Day&quot; (1944), &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; by Arthur Crudup (1946), &quot;Move It On Over&quot; by Hank Williams (1947), &quot;The Fat Man&quot; by Fats Domino (1949), Goree Carter&#x27;s &quot;Rock Awhile&quot; (1949), and Jimmy Preston&#x27;s &quot;Rock the Joint&quot; (1949) (later covered by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets in 1952).

&quot;Rocket 88&quot; by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats (Ike Turner and his band The Kings of Rhythm and sung by Brenston), was recorded by Sam Phillips in March 1951. This is often cited as the first rock n&#x27; roll record. In an interview however, Ike Turner offered this comment: &quot;I don&#x27;t think that &#x27;Rocket 88&#x27; is rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. I think that &#x27;Rocket 88&#x27; is R&amp;B, but I think &#x27;Rocket 88&#x27; is the cause of rock and roll existing&quot;.

In terms of its wide cultural impact across society in the US and elsewhere, Bill Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, recorded in April 1954 but not a commercial success until the following year, is generally recognized as an important milestone, but it was preceded by many recordings from earlier decades in which elements of rock and roll can be clearly discerned.

Journalist Alexis Petridis argued that neither Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; nor Presley&#x27;s version of &quot;That&#x27;s Alright Mama&quot; heralded a new genre: &quot;They were simply the first white artists&#x27; interpretations of a sound already well-established by black musicians almost a decade before. It was a raucous, driving, unnamed variant of rhythm and blues that came complete with lyrics that talked about rocking&quot;.

Other artists with early rock and roll hits included Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Gene Vincent. Chuck Berry&#x27;s 1955 classic &quot;Maybellene&quot; in particular features a distorted electric guitar solo with warm overtones created by his small valve amplifier. However, the use of distortion was predated by electric blues guitarists such as Joe Hill Louis, Guitar Slim, Willie Johnson of Howlin&#x27; Wolf&#x27;s band, and Pat Hare; the latter two also made use of distorted power chords in the early 1950s. Also in 1955, Bo Diddley introduced the &quot;Bo Diddley beat&quot; and a unique electric guitar style, influenced by African and Afro-Cuban music and in turn influencing many later artists.

===Rhythm and blues===
Rock and roll was strongly influenced by R&amp;B, according to many sources, including an article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in 1985, titled, &quot;Rock! It&#x27;s Still Rhythm and Blues&quot;. In fact, the author stated that the &quot;two terms were used interchangeably&quot;, until about 1957. The other sources quoted in the article said that rock and roll combined R&amp;B with pop and country music.

Fats Domino was one of the biggest stars of rock and roll in the early 1950s and he was not convinced that this was a new genre. In 1957, he said: &quot;What they call rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll now is rhythm and blues. I&#x27;ve been playing it for 15 years in New Orleans&quot;. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;this is a valid statement ... all Fifties rockers, black and white, country born and city-bred, were fundamentally influenced by R&amp;B, the black popular music of the late Forties and early Fifties&quot;. Further, Little Richard built his ground-breaking sound of the same era with an uptempo blend of boogie-woogie, New Orleans rhythm and blues, and the soul and fervor of gospel music vocalization.

Less frequently cited as an influencer, LaVern Baker was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. The Hall remarked that her &quot;fiery fusion of blues, jazz and R&amp;B showcased her alluring vocals and set the stage for the rock and roll surge of the Fifties&quot;.

=== Rockabilly ===
&quot;Rockabilly&quot; usually (but not exclusively) refers to the type of rock and roll music which was played and recorded in the mid-1950s primarily by white singers such as Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis, who drew mainly on the country roots of the music. Presley was greatly influenced by and incorporated his style of music with that of some of the greatest Black musicians like BB King, Arthur Crudup and Fats Domino. His style of music combined with black influences created controversy during a turbulent time in history. Many other popular rock and roll singers of the time, such as Fats Domino and Little Richard, came out of the black rhythm and blues tradition, making the music attractive to white audiences, and are not usually classed as &quot;rockabilly&quot;.

Presley popularized rock and roll on a wider scale than any other single performer and by 1956, he had emerged as the singing sensation of the nation.

Bill Flagg who is a Connecticut resident, began referring to his mix of hillbilly and rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll music as rockabilly around 1953.

In July 1954, Presley recorded the regional hit &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; at Sam Phillips&#x27; Sun Studio in Memphis. Three months earlier, on April 12, 1954, Bill Haley &amp; His Comets recorded &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;. Although only a minor hit when first released, when used in the opening sequence of the movie &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; a year later, it set the rock and roll boom in motion. The song became one of the biggest hits in history, and frenzied teens flocked to see Haley and the Comets perform it, causing riots in some cities. &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; was a breakthrough success for the group; traditionally, the song has been seen as the major breakthrough for the rock and roll genre, as its immense popularity introduced the music to a global audience.

In 1956, the arrival of rockabilly was underlined by the success of songs like &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot; by Johnny Cash, &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; by Perkins, and the No. 1 hit &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; by Presley. For a few years it became the most commercially successful form of rock and roll. Later rockabilly acts, particularly performing songwriters like Buddy Holly, would be a major influence on British Invasion acts and particularly on the song writing of the Beatles and through them on the nature of later rock music.

=== Cover versions ===
Many of the earliest white rock and roll hits were covers or partial re-writes of earlier black rhythm and blues or blues songs. Through the late 1940s and early 1950s, R&amp;B music had been gaining a stronger beat and a wilder style, with artists such as Fats Domino and Johnny Otis speeding up the tempos and increasing the backbeat to great popularity on the juke joint circuit. Before the efforts of Freed and others, black music was taboo on many white-owned radio outlets, but artists and producers quickly recognized the potential of rock and roll. Some of Presley&#x27;s early recordings were covers of black rhythm and blues or blues songs, such as &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; (a countrified arrangement of a blues number), &quot;Baby Let&#x27;s Play House&quot;, &quot;Lawdy Miss Clawdy&quot;, and &quot;Hound Dog&quot;. The racial lines, however, are rather more clouded by the fact that some of these R&amp;B songs originally recorded by black artists had been written by white songwriters, such as the team of Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. Songwriting credits were often unreliable; many publishers, record executives, and even managers (both white and black) would insert their name as a composer in order to collect royalty checks.

Covers were customary in the music industry at the time; it was made particularly easy by the compulsory license provision of United States copyright law (still in effect). One of the first relevant successful covers was Wynonie Harris&#x27;s transformation of Roy Brown&#x27;s 1947 original jump blues hit &quot;Good Rocking Tonight&quot; into a more showy rocker and the Louis Prima rocker &quot;Oh Babe&quot; in 1950, as well as Amos Milburn&#x27;s cover of what may have been the first white rock and roll record, Hardrock Gunter&#x27;s &quot;Birmingham Bounce&quot; in 1949. The most notable trend, however, was white pop covers of black R&amp;B numbers. The more familiar sound of these covers may have been more palatable to white audiences, there may have been an element of prejudice, but labels aimed at the white market also had much better distribution networks and were generally much more profitable. Famously, Pat Boone recorded sanitized versions of songs recorded by the likes of Fats Domino, Little Richard, the Flamingos and Ivory Joe Hunter. Later, as those songs became popular, the original artists&#x27; recordings received radio play as well.

The cover versions were not necessarily straightforward imitations. For example, Bill Haley&#x27;s incompletely bowdlerized cover of &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; transformed Big Joe Turner&#x27;s humorous and racy tale of adult love into an energetic teen dance number, while Georgia Gibbs replaced Etta James&#x27; tough, sarcastic vocal in &quot;Roll With Me, Henry&quot; (covered as &quot;Dance With Me, Henry&quot;) with a perkier vocal more appropriate for an audience unfamiliar with the song to which James&#x27;s song was an answer, Hank Ballard&#x27;s &quot;Work With Me, Annie&quot;. Presley&#x27;s rock and roll version of &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, taken mainly from a version recorded by the pop band Freddie Bell and the Bellboys, was very different from the blues shouter that Big Mama Thornton had recorded four years earlier. Other white artists who recorded cover versions of rhythm and blues songs included Gale Storm (Smiley Lewis&#x27; &quot;I Hear You Knockin), the Diamonds (The Gladiolas&#x27; &quot;Little Darlin and Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers&#x27; &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love?&quot;), the Crew Cuts (the Chords&#x27; &quot;Sh-Boom&quot; and Nappy Brown&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Be Angry&quot;), the Fountain Sisters (The Jewels&#x27; &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot;) and the Maguire Sisters (The Moonglows&#x27; &quot;Sincerely&quot;).

== Decline and later developments ==

Some commentators have suggested a decline of rock and roll starting in 1958. The retirement of Little Richard to become a preacher (October 1957), the departure of Presley for service in the United States Army (March 1958), the scandal surrounding Jerry Lee Lewis&#x27; marriage to his thirteen-year-old cousin (May 1958), riots caused by Bill Haley&#x27;s ill-fated tour of Europe (October 1958), the deaths of Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens in a plane crash (February 1959), the breaking of the Payola scandal implicating major figures, including Alan Freed, in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs (November 1959), the arrest of Chuck Berry (December 1959), and the death of Eddie Cochran in a car crash (April 1960) gave a sense that the initial phase of rock and roll had come to an end.

During the late 1950s and early 1960s, the rawer sounds of Presley, Gene Vincent, Jerry Lee Lewis and Buddy Holly were commercially superseded by a more polished, commercial style of rock and roll influenced pop music. Marketing frequently emphasized the physical looks of the artist rather than the music, contributing to the successful careers of Ricky Nelson, Tommy Sands, Bobby Vee, Jimmy Clanton, and the Philadelphia trio of Bobby Rydell, Frankie Avalon, and Fabian, who all became &quot;teen idols&quot;.

Some music historians have also pointed to important and innovative developments that built on rock and roll in this period, including multitrack recording, developed by Les Paul, the electronic treatment of sound by such innovators as Joe Meek, and the &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; productions of Phil Spector, continued desegregation of the charts, the rise of surf music, garage rock and the Twist dance craze. Surf rock in particular, noted for the use of reverb-drenched guitars, became one of the most popular forms of American rock of the early 1960s.

While the sounds of the British Invasion would become the superseding forms of rock music during the mid-1960s, a few American artists were nonetheless able to achieve chart successes with rock and roll recordings during this time. The most notable of these was Johnny Rivers, who with hits such as &quot;Memphis&quot; (1964), popularized a &quot;Go-go&quot; style of club-oriented, danceable rock and roll that enjoyed significant success in spite of the ongoing British Invasion. Another example was Bobby Fuller and his group The Bobby Fuller Four, who were especially inspired by Buddy Holly and stuck with a rock and roll style, scoring their most notable hit with &quot;I Fought the Law&quot; (1965).

== British rock and roll ==
In the 1950s, Britain was well placed to receive American rock and roll music and culture. It shared a common language, had been exposed to American culture through the stationing of troops in the country, and shared many social developments, including the emergence of distinct youth sub-cultures, which in Britain included the Teddy Boys and the rockers. Trad jazz became popular in the UK, and many of its musicians were influenced by related American styles, including boogie woogie and the blues. The skiffle craze, led by Lonnie Donegan, used amateurish versions of American folk songs and encouraged many of the subsequent generation of rock and roll, folk, R&amp;B and beat musicians to start performing. At the same time British audiences were beginning to encounter American rock and roll, initially through films including &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot; (1955) and &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; (1956). Both movies featured the Bill Haley &amp; His Comets hit &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot;, which first entered the British charts in early 1955 – four months before it reached the US pop charts – topped the British charts later that year and again in 1956 and helped identify rock and roll with teenage delinquency.

The initial response of the British music industry was to attempt to produce copies of American records, recorded with session musicians and often fronted by teen idols. More grass roots British rock and rollers soon began to appear, including Wee Willie Harris and Tommy Steele. During this period American Rock and Roll remained dominant but in 1958 Britain produced its first &quot;authentic&quot; rock and roll song and star, when Cliff Richard reached number 2 in the charts with &quot;Move It&quot;. At the same time, TV shows such as &quot;Six-Five Special&quot; and &quot;Oh Boy!&quot; promoted the careers of British rock and rollers like Marty Wilde and Adam Faith. Cliff Richard and his backing band, the Shadows, were the most successful home grown rock and roll based acts of the era. Other leading acts included Billy Fury, Joe Brown, and Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates, whose 1960 hit song &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot; became a rock and roll standard.

As interest in rock and roll was beginning to subside in America in the late 1950s and early 1960s, it was taken up by groups in British cities like Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, and London. About the same time, a British blues scene developed, initially led by purist blues followers such as Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies who were inspired by American musicians such as Robert Johnson, Muddy Waters and Howlin&#x27; Wolf. Many groups moved towards the beat music of rock and roll and rhythm and blues from skiffle, like the Quarrymen who became the Beatles, producing a form of rock and roll revivalism that carried them and many other groups to national success from about 1963 and to international success from 1964, known in America as the British Invasion. Groups that followed the Beatles included the beat-influenced Freddie and the Dreamers, Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, Herman&#x27;s Hermits and the Dave Clark Five. Early British rhythm and blues groups with more blues influences include the Animals, the Rolling Stones, and the Yardbirds.

== Cultural influence ==
Rock and roll influenced lifestyles, fashion, attitudes, and language. In addition, rock and roll may have contributed to the civil rights movement because both African-American and European-American teens enjoyed the music.

Many early rock and roll songs dealt with issues of cars, school, dating, and clothing. The lyrics of rock and roll songs described events and conflicts to which most listeners could relate through personal experience. Topics such as sex that had generally been considered taboo began to appear in rock and roll lyrics. This new music tried to break boundaries and express emotions that people were actually feeling but had not discussed openly. An awakening began to take place in American youth culture.

=== Race ===
In the crossover of African-American &quot;race music&quot; to a growing white youth audience, the popularization of rock and roll involved both black performers reaching a white audience and white musicians performing African-American music. Rock and roll appeared at a time when racial tensions in the United States were entering a new phase, with the beginnings of the civil rights movement for desegregation, leading to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that abolished the policy of &quot;separate but equal&quot; in 1954, but leaving a policy which would be extremely difficult to enforce in parts of the United States. The coming together of white youth audiences and black music in rock and roll inevitably provoked strong white racist reactions within the US, with many whites condemning its breaking down of barriers based on color. Many observers saw rock and roll as heralding the way for desegregation, in creating a new form of music that encouraged racial cooperation and shared experience. Many authors have argued that early rock and roll was instrumental in the way both white and black teenagers identified themselves.

=== Teen culture ===
Several rock historians have claimed that rock and roll was one of the first music genres to define an age group. It gave teenagers a sense of belonging, even when they were alone. Rock and roll is often identified with the emergence of teen culture among the first baby boomer generation, who had greater relative affluence and leisure time and adopted rock and roll as part of a distinct subculture. This involved not just music, absorbed via radio, record buying, jukeboxes and TV programs like &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, but also extended to film, clothes, hair, cars and motorcycles, and distinctive language. The youth culture exemplified by rock and roll was a recurring source of concern for older generations, who worried about juvenile delinquency and social rebellion, particularly because, to a large extent, rock and roll culture was shared by different racial and social groups.

In America, that concern was conveyed even in youth cultural artifacts such as comic books. In &quot;There&#x27;s No Romance in Rock and Roll&quot; from &quot;True Life Romance&quot; (1956), a defiant teen dates a rock and roll-loving boy but drops him for one who likes traditional adult music—to her parents&#x27; relief. In Britain, where postwar prosperity was more limited, rock and roll culture became attached to the pre-existing Teddy Boy movement, largely working class in origin, and eventually to the rockers. &quot;On the white side of the deeply segregated music market&quot;, rock and roll became marketed for teenagers, as in Dion and the Belmonts&#x27; &quot;A Teenager in Love&quot; (1959).

=== Dance styles ===
From its early 1950s beginnings through the early 1960s, rock and roll spawned new dance crazes including the twist. Teenagers found the syncopated backbeat rhythm especially suited to reviving Big Band-era jitterbug dancing. Sock hops, school and church gym dances, and home basement dance parties became the rage, and American teens watched Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;American Bandstand&quot; to keep up on the latest dance and fashion styles. From the mid-1960s on, as &quot;rock and roll&quot; was rebranded as &quot;rock&quot;, later dance genres followed, leading to funk, disco, house, techno, and hip hop.

<text>Religion is a range of social-cultural systems, including designated behaviors and practices, morals, beliefs, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that generally relate humanity to supernatural, transcendental, and spiritual elements—although there is no scholarly consensus over what precisely constitutes a religion. It is an essentially contested concept. Different religions may or may not contain various elements ranging from the divine, sacredness, faith, and a supernatural being or beings.

The origin of religious belief is an open question, with possible explanations including awareness of individual death, a sense of community, and dreams. Religions have sacred histories, narratives, and mythologies, preserved in oral traditions, sacred texts, symbols, and holy places, that may attempt to explain the origin of life, the universe, and other phenomena.

Religious practices may include rituals, sermons, commemoration or veneration (of deities or saints), sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trances, initiations, matrimonial and funerary services, meditation, prayer, music, art, dance, or public service.

There are an estimated 10,000 distinct religions worldwide, though nearly all of them have regionally based, relatively small followings. Four religions—Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism—account for over 77% of the world&#x27;s population, and 92% of the world either follows one of those four religions or identifies as nonreligious, meaning that the vast majority of remaining faiths account for only 8% of the population combined. The religiously unaffiliated demographic includes those who do not identify with any particular religion, atheists, and agnostics, although many in the demographic still have various religious beliefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pew Global Unaffiliated 12/2012&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Many world religions are also organized religions, most definitively including the Abrahamic religions Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, while others are arguably less so, in particular folk religions, indigenous religions, and some Eastern religions. A portion of the world&#x27;s population are members of new religious movements. Scholars have indicated that global religiosity may be increasing due to religious countries having generally higher birth rates.

The study of religion comprises a wide variety of academic disciplines, including theology, philosophy of religion, comparative religion, and social scientific studies. Theories of religion offer various explanations for its origins and workings, including the ontological foundations of religious being and belief.

== Etymology and history of concept ==
===Etymology===
The term &quot;religion&quot; comes from both Old French and Anglo-Norman (1200s CE) and means respect for sense of right, moral obligation, sanctity, what is sacred, reverence for the gods. It is ultimately derived from the Latin word . According to Roman philosopher Cicero, comes from : (meaning &quot;again&quot;) + (meaning &quot;read&quot;), where is in the sense of &quot;go over&quot;, &quot;choose&quot;, or &quot;consider carefully&quot;. Contrarily, some modern scholars such as Tom Harpur and Joseph Campbell have argued that is derived from : (meaning &quot;again&quot;) + (&quot;bind&quot; or &quot;connect&quot;), which was made prominent by St. Augustine following the interpretation given by Lactantius in , IV, 28. The medieval usage alternates with &quot;order&quot; in designating bonded communities like those of monastic orders: &quot;we hear of the &#x27;religion&#x27; of the Golden Fleece, of a knight &#x27;of the religion of Avys&#x27;.&quot;

In classic antiquity, broadly meant conscientiousness, sense of right, moral obligation, or duty to anything. In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin root was understood as an individual virtue of worship in mundane contexts; never as doctrine, practice, or actual source of knowledge. In general, referred to broad social obligations towards anything including family, neighbors, rulers, and even towards God. was most often used by the ancient Romans not in the context of a relation towards gods, but as a range of general emotions which arose from heightened attention in any mundane context such as hesitation, caution, anxiety, or fear, as well as feelings of being bound, restricted, or inhibited. The term was also closely related to other terms like (which meant &quot;very precisely&quot;), and some Roman authors related the term (which meant too much fear or anxiety or shame) to at times. When came into English around the 1200s as religion, it took the meaning of &quot;life bound by monastic vows&quot; or monastic orders. The compartmentalized concept of religion, where religious and worldly things were separated, was not used before the 1500s. The concept of religion was first used in the 1500s to distinguish the domain of the church and the domain of civil authorities; the Peace of Augsburg marks such instance, which has been described by Christian Reus-Smit as &quot;the first step on the road toward a European system of sovereign states.&quot;

Roman general Julius Caesar used to mean &quot;obligation of an oath&quot; when discussing captured soldiers making an oath to their captors. Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder used the term to describe the apparent respect given by elephants to the night sky. Cicero used as being related to (worship of the gods).
In Ancient Greece, the Greek term () was loosely translated into Latin as in late antiquity. was sparsely used in classical Greece but became more frequently used in the writings of Josephus in the 1st century CE. It was used in mundane contexts and could mean multiple things from respectful fear to excessive or harmfully distracting practices of others, to cultic practices. It was often contrasted with the Greek word , which meant too much fear.

===History of the concept of the &quot;religion&quot;===
Religion is a modern concept. The concept was invented recently in the English language and is found in texts from the 17th century due to events such as the splitting of Christendom during the Protestant Reformation and globalization in the Age of Exploration, which involved contact with numerous foreign cultures with non-European languages. Some argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply the term religion to non-Western cultures, while some followers of various faiths rebuke using the word to describe their own belief system.

The concept of &quot;ancient religion&quot; stems from modern interpretations of a range of practices that conform to a modern concept of religion, influenced by early modern and 19th century Christian discourse. The concept of religion was formed in the 16th and 17th centuries, despite the fact that ancient sacred texts like the Bible, the Quran, and others did not have a word or even a concept of religion in the original languages and neither did the people or the cultures in which these sacred texts were written. For example, there is no precise equivalent of religion in Hebrew, and Judaism does not distinguish clearly between religious, national, racial, or ethnic identities. One of its central concepts is , meaning the walk or path sometimes translated as law, which guides religious practice and belief and many aspects of daily life. Even though the beliefs and traditions of Judaism are found in the ancient world, ancient Jews saw Jewish identity as being about an ethnic or national identity and did not entail a compulsory belief system or regulated rituals. In the 1st century CE, Josephus had used the Greek term (Judaism) as an ethnic term and was not linked to modern abstract concepts of religion or a set of beliefs. The very concept of &quot;Judaism&quot; was invented by the Christian Church, and it was in the 19th century that Jews began to see their ancestral culture as a religion analogous to Christianity. The Greek word , which was used by Greek writers such as Herodotus and Josephus, is found in the New Testament. is sometimes translated as &quot;religion&quot; in today&#x27;s translations, but the term was understood as generic &quot;worship&quot; well into the medieval period. In the Quran, the Arabic word is often translated as religion in modern translations, but up to the mid-1600s translators expressed as &quot;law.&quot;

The Sanskrit word dharma, sometimes translated as religion, also means law. Throughout classical South Asia, the study of law consisted of concepts such as penance through piety and ceremonial as well as practical traditions. Medieval Japan at first had a similar union between imperial law and universal or Buddha law, but these later became independent sources of power.

Though traditions, sacred texts, and practices have existed throughout time, most cultures did not align with Western conceptions of religion since they did not separate everyday life from the sacred. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, Confucianism, and world religions first entered the English language. Native Americans were also thought of as not having religions and also had no word for religion in their languages either. No one self-identified as a Hindu or Buddhist or other similar terms before the 1800s. &quot;Hindu&quot; has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, and later religious identifier for people indigenous to the Indian subcontinent. Throughout its long history, Japan had no concept of religion since there was no corresponding Japanese word, nor anything close to its meaning, but when American warships appeared off the coast of Japan in 1853 and forced the Japanese government to sign treaties demanding, among other things, freedom of religion, the country had to contend with this idea.

According to the philologist Max Müller in the 19th century, the root of the English word religion, the Latin , was originally used to mean only reverence for God or the gods, careful pondering of divine things, piety (which Cicero further derived to mean diligence). Müller characterized many other cultures around the world, including Egypt, Persia, and India, as having a similar power structure at this point in history. What is called ancient religion today, they would have only called law.

== Definition ==
Scholars have failed to agree on a definition of religion. There are, however, two general definition systems: the sociological/functional and the phenomenological/philosophical.

=== Modern Western ===
The concept of religion originated in the modern era in the West. Parallel concepts are not found in many current and past cultures; there is no equivalent term for religion in many languages. Scholars have found it difficult to develop a consistent definition, with some giving up on the possibility of a definition. Others argue that regardless of its definition, it is not appropriate to apply it to non-Western cultures.

An increasing number of scholars have expressed reservations about ever defining the essence of religion. They observe that the way the concept today is used is a particularly modern construct that would not have been understood through much of history and in many cultures outside the West (or even in the West until after the Peace of Westphalia). The MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions states:

The anthropologist Clifford Geertz defined religion as a:

Alluding perhaps to Tylor&#x27;s &quot;deeper motive&quot;, Geertz remarked that:
The theologian Antoine Vergote took the term supernatural simply to mean whatever transcends the powers of nature or human agency. He also emphasized the cultural reality of religion, which he defined as:
Peter Mandaville and Paul James intended to get away from the modernist dualisms or dichotomous understandings of immanence/transcendence, spirituality/materialism, and sacredness/secularity. They define religion as:
According to the &quot;MacMillan Encyclopedia of Religions&quot;, there is an experiential aspect to religion which can be found in almost every culture:
Anthropologists Lyle Steadman and Craig T. Palmer emphasized the communication of supernatural beliefs, defining religion as:
=== Classical ===

Friedrich Schleiermacher in the late 18th century defined religion as &quot;das schlechthinnige Abhängigkeitsgefühl&quot;, commonly translated as &quot;the feeling of absolute dependence&quot;.

His contemporary Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel disagreed thoroughly, defining religion as &quot;the Divine Spirit becoming conscious of Himself through the finite spirit.&quot;

Edward Burnett Tylor defined religion in 1871 as &quot;the belief in spiritual beings&quot;. He argued that narrowing the definition to mean the belief in a supreme deity or judgment after death or idolatry and so on, would exclude many peoples from the category of religious, and thus &quot;has the fault of identifying religion rather with particular developments than with the deeper motive which underlies them.&quot; He also argued that the belief in spiritual beings exists in all known societies.

In his book &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;, the psychologist William James defined religion as &quot;the feelings, acts, and experiences of individual men in their solitude, so far as they apprehend themselves to stand in relation to whatever they may consider the divine.&quot; By the term divine James meant &quot;any object that is god&quot;like&quot;, whether it be a concrete deity or not&quot; to which the individual feels impelled to respond with solemnity and gravity.

Sociologist Émile Durkheim, in his seminal book &quot;The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life&quot;, defined religion as a &quot;unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things&quot;. By sacred things he meant things &quot;set apart and forbidden—beliefs and practices which unite into one single moral community called a Church, all those who adhere to them.&quot; Sacred things are not, however, limited to gods or spirits. On the contrary, a sacred thing can be &quot;a rock, a tree, a spring, a pebble, a piece of wood, a house, in a word, anything can be sacred.&quot; Religious beliefs, myths, dogmas and legends are the representations that express the nature of these sacred things, and the virtues and powers which are attributed to them.

Echoes of James&#x27; and Durkheim&#x27;s definitions are to be found in the writings of, for example, Frederick Ferré who defined religion as &quot;one&#x27;s way of valuing most comprehensively and intensively&quot;. Similarly, for the theologian Paul Tillich, faith is &quot;the state of being ultimately concerned&quot;, which &quot;is itself religion. Religion is the substance, the ground, and the depth of man&#x27;s spiritual life.&quot;

When religion is seen in terms of sacred, divine, intensive valuing, or ultimate concern, then it is possible to understand why scientific findings and philosophical criticisms (e.g., those made by Richard Dawkins) do not necessarily disturb its adherents.

== Aspects ==

=== Beliefs ===
The origin of religious belief is an open question, with possible explanations including awareness of individual death, a sense of community, and dreams. Traditionally, faith, in addition to reason, has been considered a source of religious beliefs. The interplay between faith and reason, and their use as perceived support for religious beliefs, have been a subject of interest to philosophers and theologians.

=== Mythology ===


The word &quot;myth&quot; has several meanings:
# A traditional story of ostensibly historical events that serves to unfold part of the world view of a people or explain a practice, belief, or natural phenomenon;
# A person or thing having only an imaginary or unverifiable existence; or
# A metaphor for the spiritual potentiality in the human being.

Ancient polytheistic religions, such as those of Greece, Rome, and Scandinavia, are usually categorized under the heading of mythology. Religions of pre-industrial peoples, or cultures in development, are similarly called myths in the anthropology of religion. The term myth can be used pejoratively by both religious and non-religious people. By defining another person&#x27;s religious stories and beliefs as mythology, one implies that they are less real or true than one&#x27;s own religious stories and beliefs. Joseph Campbell remarked, &quot;Mythology is often thought of as &quot;other people&#x27;s&quot; religions, and religion can be defined as misinterpreted mythology.&quot;

In sociology, however, the term myth has a non-pejorative meaning. There, myth is defined as a story that is important for the group, whether or not it is objectively or provably true. Examples include the resurrection of their real-life founder Jesus, which, to Christians, explains the means by which they are freed from sin, is symbolic of the power of life over death, and is also said to be a historical event. But from a mythological outlook, whether or not the event actually occurred is unimportant. Instead, the symbolism of the death of an old life and the start of a new life is most significant. Religious believers may or may not accept such symbolic interpretations.

=== Practices ===
The practices of a religion may include rituals, sermons, commemoration or veneration of a deity (god or goddess), sacrifices, festivals, feasts, trances, initiations, funerary services, matrimonial services, meditation, prayer, religious music, religious art, sacred dance, public service, or other aspects of human culture.

=== Social organisation ===
Religions have a societal basis, either as a living tradition which is carried by lay participants, or with an organized clergy, and a definition of what constitutes adherence or membership.

== Academic study ==

A number of disciplines study the phenomenon of religion: theology, comparative religion, history of religion, evolutionary origin of religions, anthropology of religion, psychology of religion (including neuroscience of religion and evolutionary psychology of religion), law and religion, and sociology of religion.

Daniel L. Pals mentions eight classical theories of religion, focusing on various aspects of religion: animism and magic, by E.B. Tylor and J.G. Frazer; the psycho-analytic approach of Sigmund Freud; and further Émile Durkheim, Karl Marx, Max Weber, Mircea Eliade, E.E. Evans-Pritchard, and Clifford Geertz.

Michael Stausberg gives an overview of contemporary theories of religion, including cognitive and biological approaches.

=== Theories ===
Sociological and anthropological theories of religion generally attempt to explain the origin and function of religion. These theories define what they present as universal characteristics of religious belief and practice.

==== Origins and development ====
The origin of religion is uncertain. There are a number of theories regarding the subsequent origins of religious practices.

According to anthropologists John Monaghan and Peter Just, &quot;Many of the great world religions appear to have begun as revitalization movements of some sort, as the vision of a charismatic prophet fires the imaginations of people seeking a more comprehensive answer to their problems than they feel is provided by everyday beliefs. Charismatic individuals have emerged at many times and places in the world. It seems that the key to long-term success—and many movements come and go with little long-term effect—has relatively little to do with the prophets, who appear with surprising regularity, but more to do with the development of a group of supporters who are able to institutionalize the movement.&quot;

The development of religion has taken different forms in different cultures. Some religions place an emphasis on belief, while others emphasize practice. Some religions focus on the subjective experience of the religious individual, while others consider the activities of the religious community to be most important. Some religions claim to be universal, believing their laws and cosmology to be binding for everyone, while others are intended to be practiced only by a closely defined or localized group. In many places, religion has been associated with public institutions such as education, hospitals, the family, government, and political hierarchies.

Anthropologists John Monoghan and Peter Just state that, &quot;it seems apparent that one thing religion or belief helps us do is deal with problems of human life that are significant, persistent, and intolerable. One important way in which religious beliefs accomplish this is by providing a set of ideas about how and why the world is put together that allows people to accommodate anxieties and deal with misfortune.&quot;

==== Cultural system ====
While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in religious studies courses, was proposed by Clifford Geertz, who simply called it a &quot;cultural system&quot;. A critique of Geertz&#x27;s model by Talal Asad categorized religion as &quot;an anthropological category&quot;. Richard Niebuhr&#x27;s (1894–1962) five-fold classification of the relationship between Christ and culture, however, indicates that religion and culture can be seen as two separate systems, though with some interplay.

==== Social constructionism ====

One modern academic theory of religion, social constructionism, says that religion is a modern concept that suggests all spiritual practice and worship follows a model similar to the Abrahamic religions as an orientation system that helps to interpret reality and define human beings. Among the main proponents of this theory of religion are Daniel Dubuisson, Timothy Fitzgerald, Talal Asad, and Jason Ānanda Josephson. The social constructionists argue that religion is a modern concept that developed from Christianity and was then applied inappropriately to non-Western cultures.

==== Cognitive science ====
Cognitive science of religion is the study of religious thought and behavior from the perspective of the cognitive and evolutionary sciences. The field employs methods and theories from a very broad range of disciplines, including: cognitive psychology, evolutionary psychology, cognitive anthropology, artificial intelligence, cognitive neuroscience, neurobiology, zoology, and ethology. Scholars in this field seek to explain how human minds acquire, generate, and transmit religious thoughts, practices, and schemas by means of ordinary cognitive capacities.

Hallucinations and delusions related to religious content occurs in about 60% of people with schizophrenia. While this number varies across cultures, this had led to theories about a number of influential religious phenomena and possible relation to psychotic disorders. A number of prophetic experiences are consistent with psychotic symptoms, although retrospective diagnoses are practically impossible. Schizophrenic episodes are also experienced by people who do not have belief in gods.

Religious content is also common in temporal lobe epilepsy, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Atheistic content is also found to be common with temporal lobe epilepsy.

=== Comparativism ===

Comparative religion is the branch of the study of religions concerned with the systematic comparison of the doctrines and practices of the world&#x27;s religions. In general, the comparative study of religion yields a deeper understanding of the fundamental philosophical concerns of religion such as ethics, metaphysics, and the nature and form of salvation. Studying such material is meant to give one a richer and more sophisticated understanding of human beliefs and practices regarding the sacred, numinous, spiritual and divine.

In the field of comparative religion, a common geographical classification of the main world religions includes Middle Eastern religions (including Zoroastrianism and Iranian religions), Indian religions, East Asian religions, African religions, American religions, Oceanic religions, and classical Hellenistic religions.

== Classification ==

In the 19th and 20th centuries, the academic practice of comparative religion divided religious belief into philosophically defined categories called world religions. Some academics studying the subject have divided religions into three broad categories:
# World religions, a term which refers to transcultural, international religions;
# Indigenous religions, which refers to smaller, culture-specific or nation-specific religious groups; and
# New religious movements, which refers to recently developed religions.

Some recent scholarship has argued that not all types of religion are necessarily separated by mutually exclusive philosophies, and furthermore that the utility of ascribing a practice to a certain philosophy, or even calling a given practice religious, rather than cultural, political, or social in nature, is limited. The current state of psychological study about the nature of religiousness suggests that it is better to refer to religion as a largely invariant phenomenon that should be distinguished from cultural norms (i.e. religions).

=== Morphological classification ===
Some religion scholars classify religions as either &quot;universal religions&quot; that seek worldwide acceptance and actively look for new converts, such as the Baháʼí Faith, Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, and Jainism, while &quot;ethnic religions&quot; are identified with a particular ethnic group and do not seek converts. Others reject the distinction, pointing out that all religious practices, whatever their philosophical origin, are ethnic because they come from a particular culture.

=== Demographic classification ===

The five largest religious groups by world population, estimated to account for 5.8 billion people and 84% of the population, are Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism (with the relative numbers for Buddhism and Hinduism dependent on the extent of syncretism), and traditional folk religions.


A global poll in 2012 surveyed 57 countries and reported that 59% of the world&#x27;s population identified as religious, 23% as not religious, 13% as convinced atheists, and also a 9% decrease in identification as religious when compared to the 2005 average from 39 countries. A follow-up poll in 2015 found that 63% of the globe identified as religious, 22% as not religious, and 11% as convinced atheists. On average, women are more religious than men. Some people follow multiple religions or multiple religious principles at the same time, regardless of whether or not the religious principles they follow traditionally allow for syncretism. Unaffiliated populations are projected to drop, even when taking disaffiliation rates into account, due to differences in birth rates.

Scholars have indicated that global religiosity may be increasing due to religious countries having higher birth rates in general.

== Specific religions ==
=== Abrahamic ===

Abrahamic religions are monotheistic religions which believe they descend from Abraham.

==== Judaism ====

Judaism is the oldest Abrahamic religion, originating in the people of ancient Israel and Judah. The Torah is its foundational text, and is part of the larger text known as the Tanakh or Hebrew Bible. It is supplemented by oral tradition, set down in written form in later texts such as the Midrash and the Talmud. Judaism includes a wide corpus of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. Within Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from Rabbinic Judaism, which holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah; historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups. The Jewish people were scattered after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE. Today there are about 13 million Jews, about 40 per cent living in Israel and 40 per cent in the United States. The largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism (Haredi Judaism and Modern Orthodox Judaism), Conservative Judaism and Reform Judaism.

==== Christianity ====
Christianity is based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth (1st century) as presented in the New Testament. The Christian faith is essentially faith in Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God, and as Savior and Lord. Almost all Christians believe in the Trinity, which teaches the unity of Father, Son (Jesus Christ), and Holy Spirit as three persons in one Godhead. Most Christians can describe their faith with the Nicene Creed. As the religion of Byzantine Empire in the first millennium and of Western Europe during the time of colonization, Christianity has been propagated throughout the world via missionary work. It is the world&#x27;s largest religion, with about 2.3 billion followers as of 2015. The main divisions of Christianity are, according to the number of adherents:
* The Catholic Church, led by the Bishop of Rome and the bishops worldwide in communion with him, is a communion of 24 Churches &quot;sui iuris&quot;, including the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic churches, such as the Maronite Catholic Church.
* Eastern Christianity, which include Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy, and the Church of the East.
* Protestantism, separated from the Catholic Church in the 16th-century Protestant Reformation and is split into thousands of denominations. Major branches of Protestantism include Anglicanism, Baptists, Calvinism, Lutheranism, and Methodism, though each of these contain many different denominations or groups.

There are also smaller groups, including:
* Restorationism, the belief that Christianity should be restored (as opposed to reformed) along the lines of what is known about the apostolic early church.
* Latter-day Saint movement, founded by Joseph Smith in the late 1820s.
* Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, founded in the late 1870s by Charles Taze Russell.

==== Islam ====

Islam is a monotheistic religion based on the Quran, one of the holy books considered by Muslims to be revealed by God, and on the teachings (hadith) of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, a major political and religious figure of the 7th century CE. Islam is based on the unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the Abrahamic prophets of Judaism, Christianity and other Abrahamic religions before Muhammad. It is the most widely practiced religion of Southeast Asia, North Africa, Western Asia, and Central Asia, while Muslim-majority countries also exist in parts of South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Europe. There are also several Islamic republics, including Iran, Pakistan, Mauritania, and Afghanistan. With about 1.8 billion followers (2015), almost a quarter of earth&#x27;s population are Muslims.
* Sunni Islam is the largest denomination within Islam and follows the Qur&#x27;an, the ahadith (plural of Hadith) which record the sunnah, whilst placing emphasis on the sahabah.
* Shia Islam is the second largest denomination of Islam and its adherents believe that Ali succeeded Muhammad and further places emphasis on Muhammad&#x27;s family.
* There are also Muslim revivalist movements such as Muwahhidism and Salafism.

Other denominations of Islam include Nation of Islam, Ibadi, Sufism, Quranism, Mahdavia, Ahmadiyya and non-denominational Muslims. Wahhabism is the dominant Muslim schools of thought in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

==== Other ====
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam are the three most popular Abrahamic faiths, however there are smaller and newer traditions that lay claim to the designation of Abrahamic as well.

For example, the Baháʼí Faith is a new religious movement that has links to the major Abrahamic religions as well as other religions (e.g., of Eastern philosophy). Founded in 19th-century Iran, it teaches the unity of all religious philosophies and accepts all of the prophets of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam as well as additional prophets (Buddha, Mahavira), including its founder Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh. It is an offshoot of Bábism. One of its divisions is the Orthodox Baháʼí Faith.

Even smaller regional Abrahamic groups also exist, including Samaritanism (primarily in Israel and the State of Palestine), the Rastafari movement (primarily in Jamaica), and Druze (primarily in Syria, Lebanon, and Israel).

The Druze faith originally developed out of Isma&#x27;ilism, and it has sometimes been considered an Islamic school by some Islamic authorities, but Druze themselves do not identify as Muslims. Scholars classify the Druze faith as an independent Abrahamic religion because it developed its own unique doctrines and eventually separated from both Isma&#x27;ilism and Islam altogether. One of these doctrines includes the belief that Al-Ḥākim bi-Amr Allāh was an incarnation of God.

Mandaeism, sometimes also known as Sabianism (after the mysterious Sabians mentioned in the Quran, a name historically claimed by several religious groups), is a Gnostic, monotheistic and ethnic religion. Its adherents, the Mandaeans, consider John the Baptist to be their chief prophet. Mandaeans are the last surviving Gnostics from antiquity.

=== East Asian ===

East Asian religions (also known as Far Eastern religions or Taoic religions) consist of several religions of East Asia which make use of the concept of Tao (in Chinese), Dō (in Japanese or Korean) or Đạo (in Vietnamese). They include:

==== Taoism and Confucianism ====

* Taoism and Confucianism, as well as Korean, Vietnamese, and Japanese religion influenced by Chinese thought.

==== Folk religions ====
Chinese folk religion: the indigenous religions of the Han Chinese, or, by metonymy, of all the populations of the Chinese cultural sphere. It includes the syncretism of Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism, Wuism, as well as many new religious movements such as Chen Tao, Falun Gong and Yiguandao.

Other folk and new religions of East Asia and Southeast Asia such as Korean shamanism, Chondogyo, and Jeung San Do in Korea; indigenous Philippine folk religions in the Philippines; Shinto, Shugendo, Ryukyuan religion, and Japanese new religions in Japan; Satsana Phi in Laos; Vietnamese folk religion, and Cao Đài, Hòa Hảo in Vietnam.

=== Indian religions ===
Indian religions are practiced or were founded in the Indian subcontinent. They are sometimes classified as the &quot;dharmic religions&quot;, as they all feature dharma, the specific law of reality and duties expected according to the religion.

==== Hinduism ====
Hinduism is also called &quot;Vaidika Dharma&quot;, the &quot;dharma&quot; of the Vedas, although many practitioners refer to their religion as &quot;Sanātana Dharma&quot; (&quot;the Eternal Dharma&quot;) which refers to the idea that its origins lie beyond human history. &quot;Vaidika Dharma&quot; is a synecdoche describing the similar philosophies of Vaishnavism, Shaivism, and related groups practiced or founded in the Indian subcontinent. Concepts most of them share in common include karma, caste, reincarnation, mantras, yantras, and darśana. Deities in Hinduism are referred to as Deva (masculine) and Devi (feminine). Major deities include Vishnu, Lakshmi, Shiva, Parvati, Brahma and Saraswati. These deities have distinct and complex personalities yet are often viewed as aspects of the same Ultimate Reality called Brahman. Hinduism is one of the most ancient of still-active religious belief systems, with origins perhaps as far back as prehistoric times. Therefore, Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world.

==== Jainism ====
Jainism, taught primarily by Rishabhanatha (the founder of ahimsa) is an ancient Indian religion that prescribes a path of non-violence, truth and anekantavada for all forms of living beings in this universe; which helps them to eliminate all the Karmas, and hence to attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death (saṃsāra), that is, achieving nirvana. Jains are found mostly in India. According to Dundas, outside of the Jain tradition, historians date the Mahavira as about contemporaneous with the Buddha in the 5th-century BCE, and accordingly the historical Parshvanatha, based on the c. 250-year gap, is placed in 8th or 7th century BCE.
* Digambara Jainism (or sky-clad) is mainly practiced in South India. Their holy books are Pravachanasara and Samayasara written by their Prophets Kundakunda and Amritchandra as their original canon is lost.
* Shwetambara Jainism (or white-clad) is mainly practiced in Western India. Their holy books are Jain Agamas, written by their Prophet Sthulibhadra.

==== Buddhism ====
Buddhism was founded by Siddhartha Gautama in the 5th century BCE. Buddhists generally agree that Gotama aimed to help sentient beings end their suffering (dukkha) by understanding the true nature of phenomena, thereby escaping the cycle of suffering and rebirth (saṃsāra), that is, achieving nirvana.
* Theravada Buddhism, which is practiced mainly in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia alongside folk religion, shares some characteristics of Indian religions. It is based in a large collection of texts called the Pali Canon.
* Mahayana Buddhism (or the Great Vehicle) under which are a multitude of doctrines that became prominent in China and are still relevant in Vietnam, Korea, Japan and to a lesser extent in Europe and the United States. Mahayana Buddhism includes such disparate teachings as Zen or Pure Land.

* Vajrayana Buddhism first appeared in India in the 3rd century CE. It is currently most prominent in the Himalaya regions and extends across all of Asia (cf. Mikkyō).
* Two notable new Buddhist sects are Hòa Hảo and the Navayana (Dalit Buddhist movement), which were developed separately in the 20th century.

==== Sikhism ====
Sikhism is a panentheistic religion founded on the teachings of Guru Nanak and ten successive Sikh gurus in 15th-century Punjab. It is the fifth-largest organized religion in the world, with approximately 30 million Sikhs. Sikhs are expected to embody the qualities of a &quot;Sant-Sipāhī&quot;—a saint-soldier, have control over one&#x27;s internal vices and be able to be constantly immersed in virtues clarified in the Guru Granth Sahib. The principal beliefs of Sikhi are faith in &quot;Waheguru&quot;—represented by the phrase &quot;ik ōaṅkār&quot;, one cosmic divine actioner (God), who prevails in everything, along with a praxis in which the Sikh is enjoined to engage in social reform through the pursuit of justice for all human beings.

=== Indigenous and folk ===


Indigenous religions or folk religions refers to a broad category of traditional religions that can be characterised by shamanism, animism and ancestor worship, where traditional means &quot;indigenous, that which is aboriginal or foundational, handed down from generation to generation...&quot;. These are religions that are closely associated with a particular group of people, ethnicity or tribe; they often have no formal creeds or sacred texts. Some faiths are syncretic, fusing diverse religious beliefs and practices.
* Australian Aboriginal religions.
* Folk religions of the Americas: Native American religions

Folk religions are often omitted as a category in surveys even in countries where they are widely practiced, e.g., in China.

=== Traditional African ===

African traditional religion encompasses the traditional religious beliefs of people in Africa. In West Africa, these religions include the Akan religion, Dahomey (Fon) mythology, Efik mythology, Odinani, Serer religion (A ƭat Roog), and Yoruba religion, while Bushongo mythology, Mbuti (Pygmy) mythology, Lugbara mythology, Dinka religion, and Lotuko mythology come from central Africa. Southern African traditions include Akamba mythology, Masai mythology, Malagasy mythology, San religion, Lozi mythology, Tumbuka mythology, and Zulu mythology. Bantu mythology is found throughout central, southeast, and southern Africa. In north Africa, these traditions include Berber and ancient Egyptian.

There are also notable African diasporic religions practiced in the Americas, such as Santeria, Candomble, Vodun, Lucumi, Umbanda, and Macumba.
=== Iranian ===
Iranian religions are ancient religions whose roots predate the Islamization of Greater Iran. Nowadays these religions are practiced only by minorities.

Zoroastrianism is based on the teachings of prophet Zoroaster in the 6th century BCE. Zoroastrians worship the creator Ahura Mazda. In Zoroastrianism, good and evil have distinct sources, with evil trying to destroy the creation of Mazda, and good trying to sustain it.

Kurdish religions include the traditional beliefs of the Yazidi, Alevi, and Ahl-e Haqq. Sometimes these are labeled Yazdânism.

=== New religious movements ===
* The Baháʼí Faith teaches the unity of all religious philosophies.
* Cao Đài is a syncretistic, monotheistic religion, established in Vietnam in 1926.
* Eckankar is a pantheistic religion with the purpose of making God an everyday reality in one&#x27;s life.
* Epicureanism is a Hellenistic philosophy that is considered by many of its practitioners as a type of (sometimes non-theistic) religious identity. It has its own scriptures, a monthly &quot;feast of reason&quot; on the Twentieth and considers friendship to be holy.
* Hindu reform movements, such as Ayyavazhi, Swaminarayan Faith and Ananda Marga, are examples of new religious movements within Indian religions.
* Japanese new religions &quot;(shinshukyo)&quot; is a general category for a wide variety of religious movements founded in Japan since the 19th century. These movements share almost nothing in common except the place of their founding. The largest religious movements centered in Japan include Soka Gakkai, Tenrikyo, and Seicho-No-Ie among hundreds of smaller groups.
* Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, a non-trinitarian Christian Reformist movement sometimes described as millenarian.
* Neo-Druidism is a religion promoting harmony with nature, named after but not necessarily connected to the Iron Age druids.
* Modern pagan movements attempting to reconstruct or revive ancient pagan practices, such as Heathenry, Hellenism, Roman Traditionalism, and Kemeticism.
* Noahidism is a monotheistic ideology based on the Seven Laws of Noah, and on their traditional interpretations within Rabbinic Judaism.
* Some forms of parody religion or fiction-based religion like Jediism, Pastafarianism, Dudeism, &quot;Tolkien religion&quot;, and others often develop their own writings, traditions, and cultural expressions, and end up behaving like traditional religions.
* Satanism is a broad category of religions that, for example, worship Satan as a deity (Theistic Satanism) or use Satan as a symbol of carnality and earthly values (LaVeyan Satanism and The Satanic Temple).
* Scientology is defined as a cult, a scam, a commercial business, or a new religious movement. Its mythological framework is similar to a UFO cult and includes references to aliens, but it is kept secret from most followers. It charges a fee for its central activity, on the basis of which it has been characterised as a commercial enterprise.
* UFO Religions in which extraterrestrial entities are an element of belief, such as Raëlism, Aetherius Society, and Marshall Vian Summers&#x27;s &quot;New Message from God.&quot;
* Unitarian Universalism is a religion characterized by support for a free and responsible search for truth and meaning, and has no accepted creed or theology.
* Wicca is a neo-pagan religion first popularised in 1954 by British civil servant Gerald Gardner, involving the worship of a God and Goddess.

== Related aspects ==

=== Law ===

The study of law and religion is a relatively new field, with several thousand scholars involved in law schools, and academic departments including political science, religion, and history since 1980. Scholars in the field are not only focused on strictly legal issues about religious freedom or non-establishment, but also study religions as they are qualified through judicial discourses or legal understanding of religious phenomena. Exponents look at canon law, natural law, and state law, often in a comparative perspective. Specialists have explored themes in Western history regarding Christianity and justice and mercy, rule and equity, and discipline and love. Common topics of interest include marriage and the family and human rights. Outside of Christianity, scholars have looked at law and religion links in the Muslim Middle East and pagan Rome.

Studies have focused on secularization. In particular, the issue of wearing religious symbols in public, such as headscarves that are banned in French schools, have received scholarly attention in the context of human rights and feminism.

=== Science ===
Science acknowledges reason and empirical evidence; and religions include revelation, faith and sacredness whilst also acknowledging philosophical and metaphysical explanations with regard to the study of the universe. Both science and religion are not monolithic, timeless, or static because both are complex social and cultural endeavors that have changed through time across languages and cultures.

The concepts of science and religion are a recent invention: the term religion emerged in the 17th century in the midst of colonization and globalization and the Protestant Reformation. The term science emerged in the 19th century out of natural philosophy in the midst of attempts to narrowly define those who studied nature (natural science), and the phrase religion and science emerged in the 19th century due to the reification of both concepts. It was in the 19th century that the terms Buddhism, Hinduism, Taoism, and Confucianism first emerged. In the ancient and medieval world, the etymological Latin roots of both science (&quot;scientia&quot;) and religion (&quot;religio&quot;) were understood as inner qualities of the individual or virtues, never as doctrines, practices, or actual sources of knowledge.

In general, the scientific method gains knowledge by testing hypotheses to develop theories through elucidation of facts or evaluation by experiments and thus only answers cosmological questions about the universe that can be observed and measured. It develops theories of the world which best fit physically observed evidence. All scientific knowledge is subject to later refinement, or even rejection, in the face of additional evidence. Scientific theories that have an overwhelming preponderance of favorable evidence are often treated as &quot;de facto&quot; verities in general parlance, such as the theories of general relativity and natural selection to explain respectively the mechanisms of gravity and evolution.

Religion does not have a method per se partly because religions emerge through time from diverse cultures and it is an attempt to find meaning in the world, and to explain humanity&#x27;s place in it and relationship to it and to any posited entities. In terms of Christian theology and ultimate truths, people rely on reason, experience, scripture, and tradition to test and gauge what they experience and what they should believe. Furthermore, religious models, understanding, and metaphors are also revisable, as are scientific models.

Regarding religion and science, Albert Einstein states (1940): &quot;For science can only ascertain what is, but not what should be, and outside of its domain value judgments of all kinds remain necessary. Religion, on the other hand, deals only with evaluations of human thought and action; it cannot justifiably speak of facts and relationships between facts...Now, even though the realms of religion and science in themselves are clearly marked off from each other, nevertheless there exist between the two strong reciprocal relationships and dependencies. Though religion may be that which determine the goals, it has, nevertheless, learned from science, in the broadest sense, what means will contribute to the attainment of the goals it has set up.&quot;

=== Morality ===
Many religions have value frameworks regarding personal behavior meant to guide adherents in determining between right and wrong. These include the Five Vows of Jainism, Judaism&#x27;s halakha, Islam&#x27;s sharia, Catholicism&#x27;s canon law, Buddhism&#x27;s Noble Eightfold Path, and Zoroastrianism&#x27;s good thoughts, good words, and good deeds concept, among others.

Religion and morality are not synonymous. While it is often assumed in Christian thought that morality is ultimately based in religion, it can also have a secular basis.

The study of religion and morality can be contentious due to ethnocentric views on morality, failure to distinguish between in group and out group altruism, and inconsistent definitions of religiosity.

=== Politics ===
==== Impact ====
Religion has had a significant impact on the political system in many countries. Notably, most Muslim-majority countries adopt various aspects of sharia, the Islamic law. Some countries even define themselves in religious terms, such as The Islamic Republic of Iran. The sharia thus affects up to 23% of the global population, or 1.57 billion people who are Muslims. However, religion also affects political decisions in many western countries. For instance, in the United States, 51% of voters would be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who did not believe in God, and only 6% more likely. Christians made up 92% of members of the US Congress, compared with 71% of the general public (in 2014). At the same time, while 23% of US adults are religiously unaffiliated, only one former member of Congress (Kyrsten Sinema, Arizona), or 0.2% of that body, claims no religious affiliation. In most European countries, however, religion has a much smaller influence on politics although it used to be much more important. For instance, same-sex marriage and abortion were illegal in many European countries until recently, following Christian (usually Catholic) doctrine. Several European leaders are atheists (e.g., France&#x27;s former president Francois Hollande or Greece&#x27;s prime minister Alexis Tsipras). In Asia, the role of religion differs widely between countries. For instance, India is still one of the most religious countries and religion still has a strong impact on politics, given that Hindu nationalists have been targeting minorities like the Muslims and the Christians, who historically belonged to the lower castes. By contrast, countries such as China or Japan are largely secular and thus religion has a much smaller impact on politics.

==== Secularism ====

Secularization is the transformation of the politics of a society from close identification with a particular religion&#x27;s values and institutions toward nonreligious values and secular institutions. The purpose of this is frequently modernization or protection of the population&#x27;s religious diversity.

=== Economics ===


One study has found there is a negative correlation between self-defined religiosity and the wealth of nations. In other words, the richer a nation is, the less likely its inhabitants to call themselves religious, whatever this word means to them (Many people identify themselves as part of a religion (not irreligion) but do not self-identify as religious).

Sociologist and political economist Max Weber has argued that Protestant Christian countries are wealthier because of their Protestant work ethic. According to a study from 2015, Christians hold the largest amount of wealth (55% of the total world wealth), followed by Muslims (5.8%), Hindus (3.3%) and Jews (1.1%). According to the same study it was found that adherents under the classification Irreligion or other religions hold about 34.8% of the total global wealth (while making up only about 20% of the world population, see section on classification).

=== Health ===
Mayo Clinic researchers examined the association between religious involvement and spirituality, and physical health, mental health, health-related quality of life, and other health outcomes. The authors reported that: &quot;Most studies have shown that religious involvement and spirituality are associated with better health outcomes, including greater longevity, coping skills, and health-related quality of life (even during terminal illness) and less anxiety, depression, and suicide.&quot;

The authors of a subsequent study concluded that the influence of religion on health is largely beneficial, based on a review of related literature. According to academic James W. Jones, several studies have discovered &quot;positive correlations between religious belief and practice and mental and physical health and longevity.&quot;

An analysis of data from the 1998 US General Social Survey, whilst broadly confirming that religious activity was associated with better health and well-being, also suggested that the role of different dimensions of spirituality/religiosity in health is rather more complicated. The results suggested &quot;that it may not be appropriate to generalize findings about the relationship between spirituality/religiosity and health from one form of spirituality/religiosity to another, across denominations, or to assume effects are uniform for men and women.

=== Violence ===

Critics such as Hector Avalos, Regina Schwartz, Christopher Hitchens, and Richard Dawkins have argued that religions are inherently violent and harmful to society by using violence to promote their goals, in ways that are endorsed and exploited by their leaders.

Anthropologist Jack David Eller asserts that religion is not inherently violent, arguing &quot;religion and violence are clearly compatible, but they are not identical.&quot; He asserts that &quot;violence is neither essential to nor exclusive to religion&quot; and that &quot;virtually every form of religious violence has its nonreligious corollary.&quot;

==== Animal sacrifice ====
Some (but not all) religions practise animal sacrifice, the ritual killing and offering of an animal to appease or maintain favour with a deity. It has been banned in India.

=== Superstition ===
Greek and Roman pagans, who saw their relations with the gods in political and social terms, scorned the man who constantly trembled with fear at the thought of the gods (&quot;deisidaimonia&quot;), as a slave might fear a cruel and capricious master. The Romans called such fear of the gods &quot;superstitio&quot;. Ancient Greek historian Polybius described superstition in ancient Rome as an &quot;instrumentum regni&quot;, an instrument of maintaining the cohesion of the Empire.

Superstition has been described as the non-rational establishment of cause and effect. Religion is more complex and is often composed of social institutions and has a moral aspect. Some religions may include superstitions or make use of magical thinking. Adherents of one religion sometimes think of other religions as superstition. Some atheists, deists, and skeptics regard religious belief as superstition.

The Roman Catholic Church considers superstition to be sinful in the sense that it denotes a lack of trust in the divine providence of God and, as such, is a violation of the first of the Ten Commandments. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that superstition &quot;in some sense represents a perverse excess of religion&quot; (para. #2110). &quot;Superstition&quot;, it says, &quot;is a deviation of religious feeling and of the practices this feeling imposes. It can even affect the worship we offer the true God, e.g., when one attributes an importance in some way magical to certain practices otherwise lawful or necessary. To attribute the efficacy of prayers or of sacramental signs to their mere external performance, apart from the interior dispositions that they demand is to fall into superstition. Cf. Matthew 23:16–22&quot; (para. #2111)

=== Agnosticism and atheism ===

The terms atheist (lack of belief in gods) and agnostic (belief in the unknowability of the existence of gods), though specifically contrary to theistic (e.g., Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) religious teachings, do not by definition mean the opposite of religious. The true opposite of religious is the word irreligious. Irreligion describes an absence of any religion; antireligion describes an active opposition or aversion toward religions in general. There are religions (including Buddhism and Taoism) that classify some of their followers as agnostic, atheistic, or nontheistic. For example, in ancient India, there were large atheistic movements and traditions (Nirīśvaravāda) that rejected the Vedas, such as the atheistic Ājīvika and the Ajñana which taught agnosticism.

=== Interfaith cooperation ===

Because religion continues to be recognized in Western thought as a universal impulse, many religious practitioners have aimed to band together in interfaith dialogue, cooperation, and religious peacebuilding. The first major dialogue was the Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions at the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, which affirmed universal values and recognition of the diversity of practices among different cultures. The 20th century has been especially fruitful in use of interfaith dialogue as a means of solving ethnic, political, or even religious conflict, with Christian–Jewish reconciliation representing a complete reverse in the attitudes of many Christian communities towards Jews.

Recent interfaith initiatives include A Common Word, launched in 2007 and focused on bringing Muslim and Christian leaders together, the &quot;C1 World Dialogue&quot;, the Common Ground initiative between Islam and Buddhism, and a United Nations sponsored &quot;World Interfaith Harmony Week&quot;.

=== Culture ===
Culture and religion have usually been seen as closely related. Paul Tillich looked at religion as the soul of culture and culture as the form or framework of religion. In his own words:
Religion as ultimate concern is the meaning-giving substance of culture, and culture is the totality of forms in which the basic concern of religion expresses itself. In abbreviation: religion is the substance of culture, culture is the form of religion. Such a consideration definitely prevents the establishment of a dualism of religion and culture. Every religious act, not only in organized religion, but also in the most intimate movement of the soul, is culturally formed.
Ernst Troeltsch, similarly, looked at culture as the soil of religion and thought that, therefore, transplanting a religion from its original culture to a foreign culture would kill it in the same manner that transplanting a plant from its natural soil to an alien soil would kill it. However, there have been many attempts in the modern pluralistic situation to distinguish culture from religion. Domenic Marbaniang has argued that elements grounded on beliefs of a metaphysical nature (religious) are distinct from elements grounded on nature and the natural (cultural). For instance, language (with its grammar) is a cultural element while sacralization of language in which a particular religious scripture is written is more often a religious practice. The same applies to music and the arts.

<text>Reed College is a private liberal arts college in Portland, Oregon, United States. Founded in 1908, Reed is a residential college with a campus in the Eastmoreland neighborhood, Tudor-Gothic style architecture, and a forested canyon nature preserve at its center. Reed alumni include 123 Fulbright Scholars, 73 Watson Fellows, and three Churchill Scholars. Its 32 Rhodes Scholars are the second-most for a liberal arts college. Reed is ranked fourth in the United States for the percentage of its graduates who earn a PhD.

==History==

The Reed Institute (the legal name of the college) was founded in 1908 and held its first classes in 1911. Reed is named for Oregon pioneers Simeon Gannett Reed (1830–1895) and Amanda Reed (died 1904). Simeon was an entrepreneur involved in several enterprises, including trade on the Willamette and Columbia Rivers with his close friend and associate, former Portland Mayor William S. Ladd. Unitarian minister Thomas Lamb Eliot, who knew the Reeds from the church choir, is credited with convincing Reed of the need for the school. Reed&#x27;s will provided for the gift, and Ladd&#x27;s son, William Mead Ladd, donated 40 acres from the Ladd Estate Company to build the new college. Reed&#x27;s first president (1910–1919) was William Trufant Foster, a former professor at Bates College and Bowdoin College.

Reed was founded explicitly as a reaction against the &quot;prevailing model of East Coast, Ivy League education&quot;, its lack of varsity athletics, fraternities, and exclusive social clubs – as well as its coeducational, nonsectarian, and egalitarian status – intended to foster an intensely academic and intellectual college.

During the 1930s, President Dexter Keezer was concerned about the fraternization among male and female students and the consumption of alcohol by students. A large portion of the Student Council took the position that Oregon&#x27;s liquor laws did not apply to Reed&#x27;s campus. Policies restricting the ability of students from visiting the dormitories of the opposite sex were fiercely resisted.

After World War II the college saw its enrollment numbers dramatically increase as veterans began enrolling in the college.

The college has developed a reputation for the political progressivism of its student body.

==Distinguishing features==

According to sociologist Burton Clark, Reed is one of the most unusual institutions of higher learning in the United States, featuring a traditional liberal arts and natural sciences curriculum. It requires freshmen to take Humanities 110, an intensive introduction to multidisciplinary inquiry, covering ancient Greece and Rome, the Hebrew Bible and ancient Jewish history, and as of 2019, Ancient Mesoamerica and the Harlem Renaissance. Reed also has a TRIGA research reactor on campus, making it the only school in the United States to have a nuclear reactor operated primarily by undergraduates. Reed also requires all students to complete a thesis (a two-semester-long research project conducted under the guidance of professors) during the senior year as a prerequisite of graduation. Upon completion of the senior thesis, students must also pass an oral defense of ninety minutes related to the thesis topic and how the thesis relates to the larger context of the student&#x27;s studies.

Reed maintains a 9:1 student-to-faculty ratio. 
Although letter grades are given to students, grades are de-emphasized at Reed and focus is placed on a narrative evaluation. According to the school, &quot;a conventional letter grade for each course is recorded for every student, but the registrar&#x27;s office does not distribute grades to students, provided that work continues at satisfactory (C or higher) levels. Unsatisfactory grades are reported directly to the student and the student&#x27;s adviser. Papers and exams are generally returned to students with lengthy comments but without grades affixed.&quot; Students can request copies of their official transcript from the registrar. There is no dean&#x27;s list or honor roll &quot;per se&quot;, but students who maintain a GPA of 3.5 or above for an academic year receive academic commendations at the end of the spring semester which are noted on their transcripts. Many Reed students graduate without knowing their cumulative GPA or their grades in individual classes. Reed is singled out as having little to no grade inflation over the years; only ten students graduated with a perfect 4.0 GPA in the period from 1983 to 2012. (Transcripts are accompanied by a card contextualizing Reed&#x27;s grading approach so as not to penalize students&#x27; graduate school applications.) Although Reed does not award Latin honors to graduates, it confers several awards for academic achievement at commencement, including naming students to Phi Beta Kappa.

Reed has no fraternities or sororities and few NCAA sports teams although physical education classes (which range from kayaking to juggling to capoeira) are required for graduation. Reed also has several intercollegiate athletic clubs, notably the basketball, rugby, Ultimate Frisbee, and soccer teams.

==Academics==
Reed categorizes its academic program into five Divisions and the Humanities program. Overall, Reed offers five Humanities courses, twenty-six department majors, twelve interdisciplinary majors, six dual-degree programs with other colleges and universities, and programs for pre-medical and pre-veterinary students. Its three most popular majors, based on 2023 graduates, were Psychology, Biology/Biological Sciences, and Computer and Information Sciences.

===Divisions===

*Division of Arts: includes the Art (Art History and Studio Art), Dance, Music, and Theatre Departments;
*Division of History and Social Sciences: includes the History, Anthropology, Economics, Political Science, and Sociology Departments, as well as the International and Comparative Policy Studies Program;
*Division of Literature and Languages: includes the Classics, Chinese, English, French, German, Russian, and Spanish Departments, as well as the Creative Writing and General Literature Programs;
*Division of Mathematics and Natural Sciences: includes the Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, and Physics Departments, and
*Division of Philosophy, Religion, Psychology, and Linguistics: includes the Philosophy, Religion, Psychology, and Linguistics Departments.

===Humanities program===
Reed President Richard Scholz in 1922 called the educational program as a whole &quot;an honest effort to disregard old historic rivalries and hostilities between the sciences and the arts, between professional and cultural subjects, and... the formal chronological cleavage between the graduate and the undergraduate attitude of mind&quot;. The Humanities program, which came into being in 1943 (as the union of two year-long courses, one in &quot;world&quot; literature, the other in &quot;world&quot; history) is one manifestation of this effort. One change to the program was the addition of a course in Chinese Civilization in 1995. The faculty has also recently approved several significant changes to the introductory syllabus. These changes include expanding the parameters of the course to include more material regarding urban and cultural environments.

Reed&#x27;s Humanities program includes the mandatory freshman course &quot;Introduction to Western Humanities&quot; covering ancient Greek and Roman literature, history, art, religion, and philosophy. Sophomores, juniors, and seniors may take &quot;Early Modern Europe&quot; covering Renaissance thought and literature; &quot;Modern Humanities&quot; covering the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, and Modernism, and/or &quot;Foundations of Chinese Civilization&quot;. There is also a Humanities Senior Symposium.

===Interdisciplinary and dual-degree programs===
Reed also offers interdisciplinary programs in American studies, Environmental Studies, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Chemistry-Physics, Classics-Religion, Dance/Theatre, History-Literature, International and Comparative Policy Studies (ICPS), Literature-Theatre, Mathematics-Economics, and Mathematics-Physics.

Reed offers dual-degree programs in Computer Science (with University of Washington), Engineering (with Caltech, Columbia University, and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute), Forestry or Environmental Management (with Duke University), and Fine Art (with the Pacific Northwest College of Art).

===Rankings===

In 1995, Reed College refused to participate in the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; &quot;best colleges&quot; rankings, making it the first educational institution in the United States to refuse to participate in college rankings. According to Reed&#x27;s Office of Admissions the school&#x27;s refusal to participate is based in 1994 disclosures by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; about institutions flagrantly manipulating data in order to move up in the rankings in &quot;U.S. News&quot; and other popular college guides. &quot;U.S. News&quot; maintains that their rankings are &quot;a very legitimate tool for getting at a certain level of knowledge about colleges.&quot; In 2019, a team of statistics students recreated the formula used by &quot;U.S. News&quot; and were able to identify and quantify the penalty imposed on Reed. The students found the college to be ranked an estimated 52 places below an unbiased application of the U.S. News scoring rubric.

&quot;Money&quot; magazine ranked Reed 512th in the U.S. out of 623 schools evaluated for its 2022 &quot;Best Colleges for Your Money&quot; edition.

Reed is ranked as tied for the 63rd best liberal arts college by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; in its 2025 rankings, and tied for 23rd in &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot;, tied for 23rd in &quot;Most Innovative Schools&quot;, and tied for 174th in &quot;Top Performers on Social Mobility&quot;.

In 2006, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine named Reed as one of twenty-five &quot;New Ivies&quot;, listing it among &quot;the nation&#x27;s elite colleges&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Newsweek&quot; ranked Reed the 15th &quot;most rigorous&quot; college in the nation.

Reed College ranked in the bottom 6% of four year colleges nationwide in the Brookings Institution&#x27;s rating of U.S. colleges by incremental impact on alumni earnings 10 years post-enrollment.

An episode of Malcolm Gladwell&#x27;s podcast Revisionist History examines the flaws in the U.S. News system of university rankings. The episode features a project done by a Reed professor of statistics and her students to investigate the mechanics of the ranking algorithm, attempting to see if Reed&#x27;s ranking had been purposefully devalued because the school refused to submit its information to U.S. News. Previous investigations by Reed students to re-create U.S. News&#x27;s statistical ranking algorithm found that Reed&#x27;s correct 2019 rank was #38 instead of its assigned rank of #90.

==Admissions==
=== Undergraduate ===
The Class of 2026 had 394 students. Median SAT scores were 690 math and 720 reading. The class was drawn from the largest pool ever— 9,023 applicants—and was the most selective in Reed&#x27;s history, with an admittance rate of 30.8%. , to increase student enrollment from historically underrepresented minorities, Reed encourages application to the college&#x27;s &quot;Discover Reed Fly-In Program&quot;, an all-inclusive, all-expenses-paid, multi-day campus tour and open to all high school seniors who are US citizens or permanent residents, regardless of race or ethnicity.

===Tuition and finances===
The total direct cost for the 2022–23 academic year, including tuition, fees and room-and-board, was $80,710. Indirect costs (books, supplies, transportation, personal expenses) could be another $3,950. For the 2022–23 academic year, the average financial aid package was $52,284. In 2022–23 over half of students received financial aid from the college. In 2004, 1.4% of Reed graduates defaulted on their student loans – below the national Cohort Default Rate average of 5.1%.

Reed&#x27;s endowment as of June 30, 2023, was $764 million. In the economic downturn that began in late 2007, Reed&#x27;s total endowment had declined from $455 million in June 2007 to $311 million in June 2009. By the end of 2013, however, the endowment surpassed the $500 million mark.

===Academic honors===
Reed has produced the second-highest number of Rhodes scholars for any liberal arts college—32—as well as over one hundred Fulbright Scholars, over seventy Watson Fellows, and three MacArthur (&quot;Genius&quot;) Award winners. A very high proportion of Reed graduates go on to earn PhDs, particularly in the natural sciences, history, political science, and philosophy. Reed is ranked third in the percentage of graduates who go on to earn PhDs in all disciplines, after only Caltech and Harvey Mudd. In 1961, &quot;Scientific American&quot; declared that second only to Caltech, &quot;This small college in Oregon has been far and away more productive of future scientists than any other institution in the U.S.&quot; Reed is ranked first in producing PhDs in biology, second in chemistry and humanities, third in history, foreign languages, and political science, fourth in science and mathematics, fifth in physics and social sciences, sixth in anthropology, seventh in area and ethnic studies and linguistics, and eighth in English literature and medicine.

Reed&#x27;s debating team was awarded the first place sweepstakes trophy for Division II schools at the final tournament of the Northwest Forensics Conference in February 2004.

Loren Pope, former education editor for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; writes about Reed in &quot;Colleges That Change Lives,&quot; saying, &quot;If you&#x27;re a genuine intellectual, love the life of the mind, and want to learn for the sake of learning, the place most likely to empower you is not Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Chicago, or Stanford. It is the most intellectual college in the country — Reed in Portland, Oregon.&quot;

==Drug use==
Since the 1960s, Reed has had a reputation for tolerating open drug use among its students. &quot;The Insider&#x27;s Guide to the Colleges&quot;, written by the staff of &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;, notes an impression among students of institutional permissiveness: &quot;According to students, the school does not bust students for drug or alcohol use unless they cause harm or embarrassment to another student.&quot;

In April 2008, student Alex Lluch died of a heroin overdose in his on-campus dorm room. His death prompted revelations of several previous incidents, including the near-death heroin overdose of another student only months earlier. College President Colin Diver said &quot;I don&#x27;t honestly know&quot; whether the drug death was an isolated incident or part of a larger problem. &quot;When you say Reed,&quot; Diver said, &quot;two words often come to mind. One is brains. One is drugs.&quot; Local reporter James Pitkin of the newspaper &quot;Willamette Week&quot; editorialized that &quot;Reed College, a private school with one of the most prestigious academic programs in the U.S., is one of the last schools in the country where students enjoy almost unlimited freedom to experiment openly with drugs, with little or no hassles from authorities&quot;, though &quot;Willamette Week&quot; stated the following week concerning Pitkin&#x27;s editorial: &quot;As of press time, almost 500 responses, many expressing harsh criticism of &quot;Willamette Week&quot;, had been posted on our website.&quot;

In March 2010, another student died of drug-related causes in his off-campus residence. This led &quot;The New York Times&quot; to conclude that &quot;Reed... has long been known almost as much for its unusually permissive atmosphere as for its impressively rigorous academics.&quot; Law enforcement authorities promised to take action, including sending undercover agents to Reed&#x27;s annual Renn Fayre celebration.

In February 2012, the Reed administration chose to call the police following the discovery of &quot;two to three pounds of marijuana and a small amount of ecstasy and LSD in the on-campus apartment of two juniors.&quot; Following campus debate, Reed&#x27;s president at the time, Colin Diver, issued a letter to students and staff, saying the college would not tolerate illegal drug use on campus: &quot;Such behavior endangers the health and welfare of the entire community, attracts potentially dangerous criminal activity on campus, undermines the academic mission of the college, and violates the college&#x27;s obligations under state and federal law.&quot;

==Political and social activism==
Reed has a reputation for being politically left-of-center.

During the McCarthy era of the 1950s, then-President Duncan Ballantine fired Marxist philosopher Stanley Moore, a tenured professor, for his failure to cooperate with the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) investigation. According to an article in the college&#x27;s alumni magazine, &quot;because of the decisive support expressed by Reed&#x27;s faculty, students, and alumni for the three besieged teachers and for the principle of academic freedom, Reed College&#x27;s experience with McCarthyism stands apart from that of most other American colleges and universities. Elsewhere in the academic world both tenured and nontenured professors with alleged or admitted communist party ties were fired with relatively little fuss or protest. At Reed, however, opposition to the political interrogations of the teachers was so strong that some believed the campus was in danger of closure.&quot; A statement of &quot;regret&quot; by the Reed administration and Board of Trustees was published in 1981, formally revising the judgment of the 1954 trustees. In 1993, then-President Steve Koblik invited Moore to visit the college, and in 1995 the last surviving member of the Board that fired Moore expressed his regret and apologized to him.

===Reedies Against Racism===
On September 26, 2016, students organized a boycott of all college operations in participation with the National Day of Boycott, a national day of protest which was proposed by actor Isaiah Washington on Twitter in response to the issue of police brutality against African-Americans. Following the boycott, students created an activist group called Reedies Against Racism (RAR) and presented a list of demands for the college purportedly on behalf of students from marginalized backgrounds. The primary demand concerned Reed&#x27;s mandatory freshman Humanities course, proposing that the course either be changed to be more inclusive of world literature and classics or to be made not mandatory. One element of the class deemed racist by the protestors was the use of the 1978 Steve Martin song &quot;King Tut&quot; in a discussion about cultural appropriation. Students began a protest campaign against the curriculum by sitting in during lectures with signs with quotations from various African-American and non-white academics. Other protests separate from the Humanities course also included efforts to shout down speakers, including Kimberly Peirce after she was accused of profiting from transphobia while making the film &quot;Boys Don&#x27;t Cry&quot;. The group eventually focused on Reed&#x27;s banking relationship with Wells Fargo, based on allegations that the bank had invested in the Dakota Access Pipeline project and the private prison industry, and staged an occupation of Reed&#x27;s Eliot Hall.

There was some opposition to the lecture protests, notably by Reed professor of English Lucía Martínez Valdivia, who stated that a protest during her lecture on Sappho would amplify her pre-existing case of PTSD. In November 2017, Chris Bodenner of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote about growing student resentment toward the tactics of RAR. In response to protests the faculty decided to undergo the decennial review process a year early, as well as to complete the process in three months instead of the usual year. In January 2018, Humanities 110 Chair professor Libby Drumm announced in a campus-wide email that the course curriculum would be restructured after years of faculty discussion and in response to student feedback as well as input from an external review committee composed of humanities faculty from other institutes, adopting a &quot;four-module structure&quot; that would include texts from the Americas and allow greater flexibility in the curriculum which would be integrated beginning fall 2018. The external review had not in fact been completed nor reviewed at the time of the announcement.

Following &quot;a contentious year of protests, including an anti-racism sit-in in Kroger&#x27;s office&quot;, college president John Kroger resigned, effective June 2018.

==Campus==

The Reed College campus was established on a tract of land in southeast Portland known in 1910 as Crystal Springs Farm, a part of the Ladd Estate, formed in the 1870s from original land claims. The college&#x27;s grounds include of contiguous land, including a wooded wetland known as Reed Canyon.

Portland architect A. E. Doyle developed a plan, never implemented in full, modeled on the University of Oxford&#x27;s St. John&#x27;s College. The original campus buildings (including the Library, the Old Dorm Block, and what is now the primary administration building, Eliot Hall) are brick Tudor Gothic buildings in a style similar to Ivy League campuses. In contrast, the science section of campus, including the physics, biology, and psychology (originally chemistry) buildings, were designed in the Modernist style. The Psychology Building, completed in 1949, was designed by Modernist architect Pietro Belluschi at the same time as his celebrated Equitable Building in downtown Portland.

The campus and buildings have undergone several phases of growth, and there are now 21 academic and administrative buildings and 18 residence halls. Since 2004, Reed&#x27;s campus has expanded to include adjacent properties beyond its historic boundaries, such as the Birchwood Apartments complex and former medical administrative offices on either side of SE 28th Avenue, and the Parker House, across SE Woodstock from Prexy. At the same time the Willard House (donated to Reed in 1964), across from the college&#x27;s main entrance at SE Woodstock and SE Reed College Place, was converted from faculty housing to administrative use. Reed announced on July 13, 2007, that it had purchased the Rivelli farm, a tract of land south of the Garden House and west of Botsford Drive. Reed&#x27;s &quot;immediate plans for the acquired property include housing a small number of students in the former Rivelli home during the 2007–08 academic year. Longer term, the college anticipates that it may seek to develop the northern portion of the property for additional student housing&quot;.

===Residence halls===

Reed houses 945 students in 18 residence halls on campus and several college-owned houses and apartment buildings on or adjacent to campus. Residence halls on campus range from the traditional (i.e., Gothic Old Dorm Block, referred to as &quot;ODB&quot;) to the eclectic (e.g., Anna Mann, a Tudor-style cottage built in the 1920s by Reed&#x27;s founding architect A. E. Doyle, originally used as a women&#x27;s hall), language houses (Spanish, Russian, French, German, and Chinese), &quot;temporary&quot; housing, built in the 1960s (Cross Canyon – Chittick, Woodbridge, McKinley, Griffin), to more recently built dorms (Bragdon, Naito, Sullivan). There are also theme residence halls including everything from substance-free living to Japanese culture to music to a dorm for students interested in outdoors activities (hiking, climbing, bicycling, kayaking, skiing, etc.). The college&#x27;s least-loved complex (as measured by applications to the college&#x27;s housing lottery), MacNaughton and Foster-Scholz, is known on campus as &quot;Asylum Block&quot; because of its post-World War II modernist architecture and interior spaces dominated by long, straight corridors lined with identical doors, said by students to resemble that of an insane asylum. Until 2006, it was thought that these residence halls had been designed by architect Pietro Belluschi.

Under the 10-year Campus Master Plan adopted in 2006, Foster-Scholz is scheduled to be demolished and replaced, and MacNaughton to be remodeled. According to the master plan, &quot;The College&#x27;s goal is to provide housing on or adjacent to the campus that accommodates 75% of the [full-time] student population. At present, the College provides on-campus housing for 838 students&quot;.

In Spring 2007, the college broke ground on the construction of a new quadrangle called the Grove, with four new Leed certified residence halls (Aspen, Sequoia, Sitka, Bidwell). They opened on the northwest side of campus in Fall 2008. A new Spanish House residence was completed. Together, the five new residences added 142 new beds.

Reed also has off-campus housing. Many houses in the Woodstock and Eastmoreland Portland neighborhoods are traditionally rented to Reed students.

On February 21, 2018, Reed announced the construction of the &quot;largest residence hall in its history&quot;. Completed in Fall 2019, Trillium houses an additional 180 students, boosting Reed&#x27;s housing capacity to nearly 80% of the student body, up from 68%. The addition of Trillium guarantees housing for both freshman and sophomores, as students were formerly subjected to a housing lottery after freshman year. The new building is also designed to meet &quot;LEED Platinum standards&quot;, and Reed is currently evaluating proposals to put solar panels on the roof.

===Reed Canyon===

The Reed College Canyon, a natural area and national wildlife preserve, bisects the campus, separating the academic buildings from many of the residence halls (the so-called &quot;cross-canyon halls&quot;). The canyon is filled by Crystal Creek Springs, a natural spring that drains into Johnson Creek.

Canyon Day, a tradition dating back to 1915, is held twice a year. On Canyon Day students and Reed neighbors join canyon crew workers to spend a day helping with restoration efforts.

A landmark of the campus, the Blue Bridge, spans the canyon. This bridge replaced the unique cantilevered bridge that served in that spot between 1959 and 1991, which &quot;featured stressed plywood girders – the first time this construction had been used on a span of this size: a straight bridge long and high. It attracted great architectural interest during its lifetime&quot;.

A new pedestrian and bicycle bridge spanning the canyon was opened in Fall 2008. This bridge, dubbed the &quot;Bouncy Bridge&quot;, &quot;Orange Bridge&quot;, and in some cases the &quot;Amber Bridge&quot; by students, is long, about a third longer than the Blue Bridge, and &quot;connect[s] the new north campus quad to Gray Campus Center, the student union, the library, and academic buildings on the south side of campus&quot;.

===Douglas F. Cooley Gallery===
Reed&#x27;s Cooley Gallery is an internationally recognized contemporary art space located at the entrance to the Eric V. Hauser Memorial Library. It was established in 1988 as the result of a gift from Susan and Edward Cooley in honor of their late son. The Cooley Gallery has exhibited international artists such as Mona Hatoum, Al Held, David Reed and Gregory Crewdson as well as the contemporary art collection of Michael Ovitz. In pursuit of its mission to support the curriculum of the art, art history, and humanities programs at Reed, the gallery produces three or four exhibitions each year, along with lectures, colloquia, and artist visits. The gallery is currently under the directorship of Stephanie Snyder, who succeeded founding director Susan Fillin-Yeh in 2004.

===Food services===
The cafeteria, known simply as &quot;Commons&quot;, has a reputation for ecologically sustainable food services. The commons dining hall is operated by Bon Appétit, and food is purchased on an item-by-item basis. Suiting the student body, vegan and vegetarian dishes feature heavily on the menu. It is currently the only cafeteria on the small campus, with the exception of Canyon Cafe (formerly Caffe Circo and Caffe Paradiso), a small cafe on the other side of campus which also operated by board points. Scrounging is a long tradition at Reed College allowing students to offer unfinished Commons&#x27; food to students without board points from their trays as they are returned to be washed.

The Reed College Co-ops are a theme community that reside in the Farm and Garden Houses, after many years on the first floor of MacNaughton Hall. These are the only campus dorms that are independent of the school&#x27;s board plan. They traditionally throw an alternative &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; celebration that has sometimes included a square-dance. The Co-ops house students who purchase and prepare food together, sharing chores and conducting weekly, consensus-based meetings. It is a close community valuing sustainability, organic food, consensus-based decisions, self-government, music, and plants.

The Paradox (&quot;Est. in the 80s&quot;) is a student-run coffee shop located on campus. In 2003 the Paradox opened a second coffee shop, dubbing it the &quot;Paradox Lost&quot; (an allusion to John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost,&quot;) at the southern end of the biology building, in the space commonly called the &quot;Bio Fishbowl&quot;. The new north-campus dorms, which opened in Fall 2008, feature yet another small cafe, originally dubbed &quot;Cafe Paradiso&quot;, thereby providing three coffee shops within a campus. The recent addition of a circus-themed mural to the cafe prompted a name change, and it now operates as Caffe Circo. This third shop is not student-run, but is operated by Bon Appétit. Bon Appétit has a monopoly on the food services at Reed as they are the only ones who accept board points; written into their contract is the prohibition of food carts on campus.

=== 2021 collapse of the Aubrey R. Watzek Sports Center ===
On February 15, 2021, the Aubrey R. Watzek Sports Center, collapsed during Winter Storm Uri. Both gyms that were part of the sports center collapsed. The collapse was attributed to excess snow piling up on the roof of the building causing a support truss to fracture, and strained several others, causing the roof to collapse. The sports center was serving as a COVID-19 testing center, and the destruction of the testing center resulted in the loss of testing kits and other medical supplies needed for COVID-19 testing.

==Icons and student life==


===Griffin===
The official mascot of Reed is the griffin. In mythology, the griffin often pulled the chariot of the sun; in canto 32 of Dante&#x27;s &quot;Commedia&quot; the griffin is associated with the Tree of Knowledge. The griffin was featured on the coat-of-arms of founder Simeon Reed and is now on the official seal of Reed College. Though the school does not have varsity sports, the mascot features prominently throughout campus iconography outside of an athletic context.

===School color===
The official school color of Reed is Richmond Rose. Over the years, institutional memory of this fact has faded and the color appearing on the school&#x27;s publications and merchandise has darkened to a shade of maroon. The most common examples of &quot;Richmond Rose&quot; are the satin tapes securing the degree certificate inside a Reed College diploma.

===School song===
The school song, &quot;Fair Reed&quot;, is sung to the tune of the 1912 popular song &quot;Believe Me, if All Those Endearing Young Charms&quot;. It may be imitative of the Harvard anthem &quot;Fair Harvard&quot;, which is also sung to the tune of &quot;Believe Me, if All Those Endearing Young Charms&quot;. It was composed by former president William Trufant Foster shortly after Reed&#x27;s founding, and is rarely heard today.

An unofficial Reed Alma Mater, &quot;Epistemology Forever&quot;, sung to the tune of &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot;, has been sung by Reed students since the 1950s.

===Students&#x27; nicknames===
Reed students and alumni referred to themselves as &quot;Reedites&quot; in the early years of the college. This term faded out in favor of the now ubiquitous &quot;Reedie&quot; after World War II. Around campus, prospective students are called &quot;prospies&quot;.

===Unofficial mottos and folklore===
An unofficial motto of Reed is &quot;Communism, Atheism, Free Love&quot;, and can be found in the Reed College Bookstore on sweaters, T-shirts, etc. It was a label that the Reed community claimed from critics during the 1920s as a &quot;tongue-in-cheek slogan&quot; in reference to Reed&#x27;s nonconformism. Reed&#x27;s founding president William T. Foster&#x27;s outspoken opposition against the entrance of the United States into World War I, as well as the college&#x27;s support for feminism, its adherence to academic freedom (i.e., inviting a leader of the Socialist Party of America to speak on campus about the Russian Revolution’s potential effect on militarism, emancipation of women, and ending the persecution of Jews), and its nonsectarian status made the college a natural target for what was originally meant to be a pejorative slur.

The faux Reed Seal has changed over the years. In its original form the griffin was holding a hammer and sickle in its paws. Later versions had the griffin wearing boxing gloves.

One of the unofficial symbols of Reed is the Doyle Owl, a roughly concrete statue that has been continuously stolen and re-stolen since about 1919. The original Doyle Owl (originally &quot;House F Owl&quot; after the dormitory named House F that later became Doyle dormitory) was a garden sculpture from the neighborhood stolen by House F residents as a prank (there is a photo of House F residents around the original owl that has been made into a T-shirt). The on-campus folklore of events surrounding the Doyle Owl is sufficiently large that, in 1983, a senior thesis was written on the topic of the Owl&#x27;s oral history. The original Doyle Owl was destroyed many years ago; the current avatar is Doyle Owl number 13, plus or minus 11. At the present time only one Owl is being shown.

===Paideia===
Each January, before the beginning of second-semester classes, the campus holds an interim period called Paideia (drawn from the Greek, meaning &#x27;education&#x27;). Originally conceived and approved by the faculty in 1968 for unstructured independent study, or &quot;UIS&quot;, Paideia ran for the full month of January from 1969 to 1981, supervised by a committee of faculty, staff and students. This festival of learning takes the form of classes and seminars put on by anyone who wishes to teach, including students, professors, staff members, and outside educators invited on-campus by members of the Reed Community. The classes are intended to be informal, yet intellectual activities free of the usual academic pressure endemic to Reed. Many such classes are explicitly trivial (one long-running tradition is to hold an underwater basket weaving class), while others are trivially academic (such as &quot;Giant Concrete Gnome Construction&quot;, a class that, incidental to building monolithic gnomes, includes some content relating to the construction of pre-Christian monoliths). More structured classes (such as martial arts seminars and mini-classes on obscure academic topics), tournaments, and film festivals round out the schedule, which is different every year. The objective of Paideia is not only to learn new (possibly non-useful) things, but to turn the tables on students and encourage them to teach.

In his 2005 Stanford commencement lecture, Apple Inc. founder and Reed dropout Steve Jobs credited a Reed calligraphy class taught by Robert Palladino for his focus on choosing quality typefaces for the Macintosh. While the full calligraphy course is no longer taught at Reed, Paideia usually features a short course on the subject in addition to the informal, weekly gatherings (currently held every Thursday night) of aspiring calligraphy enthusiasts.

===Renn Fayre===
Renn Fayre is an annual three-day celebration with a different theme each year. Born in the 1960s as an actual renaissance fair, it has long since lost all connection to anachronism and the Renaissance, although its name has persisted. The event is initiated by a procession of seniors throwing their thesis notes in a large bonfire after the completed theses are submitted.

===Reed Arts Week===

Reed Arts Week is a week-long celebration of the arts at Reed. It features music, dance, film, creative writing, and the visual arts.

===Student organizations===
According to Reed&#x27;s website, each semester, a $130 student body fee &quot;is collected from each full-time student by the business office, acting as agent for the student senate. The fee underwrites publication of the student newspaper and extracurricular activities, and partially supports the student union and ski cabin.&quot;
Student body funds (totaling roughly $370,000 annually) are distributed each semester to groups that place among the top 40 organizations in the semester&#x27;s funding poll. The funding poll uses a voting system in which each organization provides a description that is ranked by each member of the student body with either &#x27;top six,&#x27; &#x27;approve,&#x27; &#x27;no opinion,&#x27; &#x27;disapprove.&#x27; A former &#x27;deep six&#x27; was eliminated from the system in 2019. These ranks are then tabulated by assigning numbers to each rank and summing across all voters. Afterwards, the top forty organizations present their budgets to the student body senate during Funding Circus. The following day the senate makes decisions about each budget in a process called Funding Hell.

The school&#x27;s student-run newspaper, &quot;The Reed College Quest &quot;or simply the &quot;Quest,&quot; has been published since 1913, and its radio station KRRC had been broadcasting, with a few interruptions, from 1955 The station now broadcasts online only at krrc.fm.

Although some student organizations partnered with outside groups such as Oxfam or Planned Parenthood are more structured, most student organizations are highly informal. There is no formal process for forming a student organization at Reed; a group of students (or a single student) announcing themselves as or just considering themselves a student organization is enough, but groups that desire funding from the school&#x27;s Student Activities office or Student Body Fees must register with Student Activities or through the Student Senate. The Reed archive of comic books and graphic novels, the MLLL (Comic Book Reading Room), is well into its fourth decade, and Beer Nation, the student group that organizes and manages various beer gardens throughout the year and during Renn Fayre, has existed for many years. Some organizations, such as the Motorized Couch Collective—dedicated to installing motors and wheels into furniture—have become more Reed myth than reality in recent years.

Reed has ample recreational facilities on campus, a ski cabin on Mount Hood, recreational clubs such as the Reed Outing Club (ROC), and Club Sports (with college-paid coaches), including ultimate frisbee, co-ed soccer, rugby, basketball, and squash.

===Crime===
According to a &quot;Washington Post&quot; analysis of federal campus safety data from 2014, Reed College had 12.9 reports of rape per 1,000 students, the &quot;highest total of reports of rape&quot; per 1,000 students of any college in the nation on its main campus.

In 2012, Reed College had the third highest reported sexual assault rate among U.S. colleges and universities. It is unclear whether this high reporting rate arises from the college and student body fostering an environment that is more supportive of reporting sexual assault or due to a higher offending pattern by students. in 2013 there were 19 reported forcible sexual offenses among the approximately 1,400 students at the college. In 2011, a student member of Reed&#x27;s Judicial Board resigned over the college&#x27;s handling of sexual assault cases. An investigation by the Center for Public Integrity found that those found responsible in cases of sexual assault frequently faced few consequences, while the lives of the victims were left in turmoil.

==Notable people== 
Notable Reed alumni include Tektronix co-founder Howard Vollum (1936), businessman John Sperling (1948), linguistic anthropologist Dell Hymes (1950), Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Gary Snyder (1951), fantasy author David Eddings (1954), distance learning pioneer John Bear (1959), socialist and feminist activist and author Barbara Ehrenreich (1963), radio personality Dr. Demento (1963), programmer, software publisher, author, and philanthropist Peter Norton (1965), former U.S. Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig (1965), alpinist and biophysical chemist Arlene Blum (1966), chemist Mary Jo Ondrechen (1974), computer engineer Daniel Kottke (1976), and Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger (1991).

Among those who attended but did not graduate from Reed are Academy Award-nominated actress Hope Lange, chef James Beard, horse rancher and conspiracy theorist Christopher Langan, and Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs.

Notable Reed faculty of the past and present include former U.S. Senator from Illinois Paul Douglas, and physicists Richard Crandall and David Griffiths.

== In popular culture ==
Reed has been featured in several books and movies. It is often presented as an enigmatic, eccentric institution at which people who do not fit into mainstream society come together to learn.

=== Literature ===

<text>In logic, proof by contradiction is a form of proof that establishes the truth or the validity of a proposition by showing that assuming the proposition to be false leads to a contradiction.
Although it is quite freely used in mathematical proofs, not every school of mathematical thought accepts this kind of nonconstructive proof as universally valid.

More broadly, proof by contradiction is any form of argument that establishes a statement by arriving at a contradiction, even when the initial assumption is not the negation of the statement to be proved. In this general sense, proof by contradiction is also known as indirect proof, proof by assuming the opposite, and reductio ad impossibile.

A mathematical proof employing proof by contradiction usually proceeds as follows:

#The proposition to be proved is &quot;P&quot;.
#We assume &quot;P&quot; to be false, i.e., we assume &quot;¬P&quot;.
#It is then shown that &quot;¬P&quot; implies falsehood. This is typically accomplished by deriving two mutually contradictory assertions, &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;¬Q&quot;, and appealing to the law of noncontradiction.
#Since assuming &quot;P&quot; to be false leads to a contradiction, it is concluded that &quot;P&quot; is in fact true.

An important special case is the existence proof by contradiction: in order to demonstrate that an object with a given property exists, we derive a contradiction from the assumption that all objects satisfy the negation of the property.

== Formalization ==

The principle may be formally expressed as the propositional formula &quot;¬¬P ⇒ P&quot;, equivalently &quot;(¬P ⇒ ⊥) ⇒ P&quot;, which reads: &quot;If assuming &quot;P&quot; to be false implies falsehood, then &quot;P&quot; is true.&quot;

In natural deduction the principle takes the form of the rule of inference

: formula_1

which reads: &quot;If formula_2 is proved, then formula_3 may be concluded.&quot;

In sequent calculus the principle is expressed by the sequent

: formula_4

which reads: &quot;Hypotheses formula_5 &quot;and&quot; formula_2 entail the conclusion formula_3 &quot;or&quot; formula_8.&quot;

== Justification ==

In classical logic the principle may be justified by the examination of the truth table of the proposition &quot;¬¬P ⇒ P&quot;, which demonstrates it to be a tautology:

Another way to justify the principle is to derive it from the law of the excluded middle, as follows. We assume &quot;¬¬P&quot; and seek to prove &quot;P&quot;. By the law of excluded middle &quot;P&quot; either holds or it does not:

# if &quot;P&quot; holds, then of course &quot;P&quot; holds.
# if &quot;¬P&quot; holds, then we derive falsehood by applying the law of noncontradiction to &quot;¬P&quot; and &quot;¬¬P&quot;, after which the principle of explosion allows us to conclude &quot;P&quot;.

In either case, we established &quot;P&quot;. It turns out that, conversely, proof by contradiction can be used to derive the law of excluded middle.

In classical sequent calculus LK proof by contradiction is derivable from the inference rules for negation:

: formula_9

== Relationship with other proof techniques ==

=== Refutation by contradiction ===

Proof by contradiction is similar to refutation by contradiction, also known as proof of negation, which states that &quot;¬P&quot; is proved as follows:

# The proposition to be proved is &quot;¬P&quot;.
# Assume &quot;P&quot;.
# Derive falsehood.
# Conclude &quot;¬P&quot;.

In contrast, proof by contradiction proceeds as follows:

# The proposition to be proved is &quot;P&quot;.
# Assume &quot;¬P&quot;.
# Derive falsehood.
# Conclude &quot;P&quot;.

Formally these are not the same, as refutation by contradiction applies only when the proposition to be proved is negated, whereas proof by contradiction may be applied to any proposition whatsoever. In classical logic, where formula_3 and formula_11 may be freely interchanged, the distinction is largely obscured. Thus in mathematical practice, both principles are referred to as &quot;proof by contradiction&quot;.

=== Law of the excluded middle ===

Proof by contradiction is equivalent to the law of the excluded middle, first formulated by Aristotle, which states that either an assertion or its negation is true, &quot;P ∨ ¬P&quot;.

=== Law of non-contradiction ===

The law of noncontradiction was first stated as a metaphysical principle by Aristotle. It posits that a proposition and its negation cannot both be true, or equivalently, that a proposition cannot be both true and false. Formally the law of non-contradiction is written as &quot;¬(P ∧ ¬P)&quot; and read as &quot;it is not the case that a proposition is both true and false&quot;. The law of non-contradiction neither follows nor is implied by the principle of Proof by contradiction.

The laws of excluded middle and non-contradiction together mean that exactly one of &quot;P&quot; and &quot;¬P&quot; is true.

== Proof by contradiction in intuitionistic logic ==

In intuitionistic logic proof by contradiction is not generally valid, although some particular instances can be derived. In contrast, proof of negation and principle of noncontradiction are both intuitionistically valid.

Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation of proof by contradiction gives the following intuitionistic validity condition: 

If we take &quot;method&quot; to mean algorithm, then the condition is not acceptable, as it would allow us to solve the Halting problem. To see how, consider the statement &quot;H(M)&quot; stating &quot;Turing machine &quot;M&quot; halts or does not halt&quot;. Its negation &quot;¬H(M)&quot; states that &quot;&quot;M&quot; neither halts nor does not halt&quot;, which is false by the law of noncontradiction (which is intuitionistically valid). If proof by contradiction were intuitionistically valid, we would obtain an algorithm for deciding whether an arbitrary Turing machine &quot;M&quot; halts, thereby violating the (intuitionistically valid) proof of non-solvability of the Halting problem.

A proposition &quot;P&quot; which satisfies formula_12 is known as a &quot;¬¬-stable proposition&quot;. Thus in intuitionistic logic proof by contradiction is not universally valid, but can only be applied to the ¬¬-stable propositions. An instance of such a proposition is a decidable one, i.e., satisfying formula_13. Indeed, the above proof that the law of excluded middle implies proof by contradiction can be repurposed to show that a decidable proposition is ¬¬-stable. A typical example of a decidable proposition is a statement that can be checked by direct computation, such as &quot;formula_14 is prime&quot; or &quot;formula_15 divides formula_16&quot;.

==Examples of proofs by contradiction==

===Euclid&#x27;s Elements===

An early occurrence of proof by contradiction can be found in Euclid&#x27;s Elements, Book 1, Proposition 6:

: If in a triangle two angles equal one another, then the sides opposite the equal angles also equal one another.

The proof proceeds by assuming that the opposite sides are not equal, and derives a contradiction.

===Hilbert&#x27;s Nullstellensatz===

An influential proof by contradiction was given by David Hilbert. His
Nullstellensatz states:

: If formula_17 are polynomials in indeterminates with complex coefficients, which have no common complex zeros, then there are polynomials formula_18 such that formula_19

Hilbert proved the statement by assuming that there are no such polynomials formula_20 and derived a contradiction.

===Infinitude of primes===

Euclid&#x27;s theorem states that there are infinitely many primes. In Euclid&#x27;s Elements the theorem is stated in Book IX, Proposition 20:

: Prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers.

Depending on how we formally write the above statement, the usual proof takes either the form of a proof by contradiction or a refutation by contradiction. We present here the former, see below how the proof is done as refutation by contradiction.

If we formally express Euclid&#x27;s theorem as saying that for every natural number formula_14 there is a prime bigger than it, then we employ proof by contradiction, as follows.

Given any number formula_14, we seek to prove that there is a prime larger than formula_14. Suppose to the contrary that no such &quot;p&quot; exists (an application of proof by contradiction). Then all primes are smaller than or equal to formula_14, and we may form the list formula_25 of them all. Let formula_26 be the product of all primes and formula_27. Because formula_28 is larger than all prime numbers it is not prime, hence it must be divisible by one of them, say formula_29. Now both formula_3 and formula_28 are divisible by formula_29, hence so is their difference formula_33, but this cannot be because 1 is not divisible by any primes. Hence we have a contradiction and so there is a prime number bigger than formula_14

==Examples of refutations by contradiction==

The following examples are commonly referred to as proofs by contradiction, but formally employ refutation by contradiction (and therefore are intuitionistically valid).

===Infinitude of primes===

Let us take a second look at Euclid&#x27;s theorem – Book IX, Proposition 20:

: Prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers.

We may read the statement as saying that for every finite list of primes, there is another prime not on that list,
which is arguably closer to and in the same spirit as Euclid&#x27;s original formulation. In this case Euclid&#x27;s proof applies refutation by contradiction at one step, as follows.

Given any finite list of prime numbers formula_35, it will be shown that at least one additional prime number not in this list exists. Let formula_36 be the product of all the listed primes and formula_37 a prime factor of formula_38, possibly formula_38 itself. We claim that formula_37 is not in the given list of primes. Suppose to the contrary that it were (an application of refutation by contradiction). Then formula_37 would divide both formula_3 and formula_38, therefore also their difference, which is formula_44. This gives a contradiction, since no prime number divides 1.

===Irrationality of the square root of 2===

The classic proof that the square root of 2 is irrational is a refutation by contradiction.
Indeed, we set out to prove the negation &quot;¬ ∃ a, b ∈ formula_45 . a/b = &quot; by assuming that there exist natural numbers &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; whose ratio is the square root of two, and derive a contradiction.

===Proof by infinite descent===

Proof by infinite descent is a method of proof whereby a smallest object with desired property is shown not to exist as follows:

* Assume that there is a smallest object with the desired property.
* Demonstrate that an even smaller object with the desired property exists, thereby deriving a contradiction.

Such a proof is again a refutation by contradiction. A typical example is the proof of the proposition &quot;there is no smallest positive rational number&quot;: assume there is a smallest positive rational number &quot;q&quot; and derive a contradiction by observing that is even smaller than &quot;q&quot; and still positive.

===Russell&#x27;s paradox===

Russell&#x27;s paradox, stated set-theoretically as &quot;there is no set whose elements are precisely those sets that do not contain themselves&quot;, is a negated statement whose usual proof is a refutation by contradiction.

==Notation==
Proofs by contradiction sometimes end with the word &quot;Contradiction!&quot;. Isaac Barrow and Baermann used the notation Q.E.A., for &quot;quod est absurdum&quot; (&quot;which is absurd&quot;), along the lines of Q.E.D., but this notation is rarely used today. A graphical symbol sometimes used for contradictions is a downwards zigzag arrow &quot;lightning&quot; symbol (U+21AF: ↯), for example in Davey and Priestley. Others sometimes used include a pair of opposing arrows (as formula_46 or formula_47), struck-out arrows (formula_48), a stylized form of hash (such as U+2A33: ⨳), or the &quot;reference mark&quot; (U+203B: ※), or formula_49.

== Hardy&#x27;s view==
G. H. Hardy described proof by contradiction as &quot;one of a mathematician&#x27;s finest weapons&quot;, saying &quot;It is a far finer gambit than any chess gambit: a chess player may offer the sacrifice of a pawn or even a piece, but a mathematician offers the game.&quot;

==Automated theorem proving==
In automated theorem proving the method of resolution is based on proof by contradiction. That is, in order to show that a given statement is entailed by given hypotheses, the automated prover assumes the hypotheses and the negation of the statement, and attempts to derive a contradiction.

<doc id="25420" wikidata="Q7318300" url="?curid=25420" title="Reversible error">
<text>In United States law, a reversible error is an error of sufficient gravity to warrant reversal of a judgment on appeal. It is an error by the trier of law (judge), or the trier of fact (the jury, or the judge if it is a bench trial), or malfeasance by one of the trying attorneys, which results in an unfair trial. It is to be distinguished from harmless errors which do not rise to a level which brings the validity of the judgment into question and thus do not lead to a reversal upon appeal.

==Reversible error criteria==
A finding of reversible error requires that one or more of the appellant&#x27;s &quot;substantial rights&quot; be affected, or the evidence in question be of such character as to have affected the outcome of the trial. (See e.g., &quot;Montana Petroleum Tank Release Compensation Bd. v. Crumley&#x27;s, Inc.&quot;, 174 P.3d 948 (Mont. 2008).) The criteria for determining what constitutes a &quot;substantial right&quot; is somewhat vague, however, being that it varies from case to case, each presenting a slightly different interpretation of which rights are essential, or significant enough to warrant this sort of legal protection. Therefore, reversible errors resulting from the violation of an individual&#x27;s &quot;substantial right(s)&quot; must be considered on an individual basis.

==Examples of reversible errors==
Reversible errors include, but are not limited to:
*Judge did not follow the law.
*seating a juror who has manifested impermissible bias to one party or the other,
*admitting evidence which should have been excluded under the rules of evidence,
*excluding evidence which a party was entitled to have admitted,
*giving an incorrect legal instruction to a jury,
*failure to declare a mistrial when continuing with trial amounts to a denial of due process, or
*conversely, granting a mistrial in a criminal case if the defendant objects, &quot;unless&quot; the grant was necessary to correct manifest injustice.
*hearing a case the court does not have jurisdiction to hear.
*allowing a case to proceed that was properly time-barred.

If an appellate court determines that reversible error occurred, it may reverse the judgement of the lower court and order a new trial on such terms and conditions as are found to be just.
Technically, attorney misconduct is not reversible error. Failure of the judge to remedy it during the trial is reversible error. In cases such as unfairly or illegally concealing evidence, there is no error on the part of the court but the court&#x27;s decision may still be vacated and the matter returned for a new trial, because there is no other way for justice to be granted.

<text>Rapping (also rhyming, flowing, spitting, [[Master of Ceremonies|emcee]]ing, or MCing) is an artistic form of vocal delivery and emotive expression that incorporates &quot;rhyme, rhythmic speech, and [commonly] street vernacular&quot;. It is usually performed over a backing beat or musical accompaniment. The components of rap include &quot;content&quot; (what is being said, e.g., lyrics), &quot;flow&quot; (rhythm, rhyme), and &quot;delivery&quot; (cadence, tone). Rap differs from spoken-word poetry in that it is usually performed off-time to musical accompaniment. It also differs from singing, which varies in pitch and does not always include words. Because they do not rely on pitch inflection, some rap artists may play with timbre or other vocal qualities. Rap is a primary ingredient of hip-hop music, and so commonly associated with the genre that it is sometimes called &quot;rap music&quot;.

Precursors to modern rap music include the West African griot tradition, certain vocal styles of blues and jazz, an African-American insult game called playing the dozens (see Battle rap and Diss), and 1960s African-American poetry. Stemming from the hip-hop cultural movement, rap music originated in the Bronx, New York City, in the early 1970s and became part of popular music later that decade. Rapping developed from the announcements made over the microphone at parties by DJs and MCs, evolving into more complex lyrical performances.

Rap is usually delivered over a beat, typically provided by a DJ, turntablist, or beatboxer when performing live. Much less commonly a rapper can decide to perform a cappella, meaning without accompaniment of any sort. When a rap or hip-hop artist is creating a song, &quot;track&quot;, or record, done primarily in a production studio, most frequently a producer provides the beat(s) for the MC to flow over. Stylistically, rap occupies a gray area between speech, prose, poetry, and singing. The word, which predates the musical form, originally meant &quot;to lightly strike&quot;, and is now used to describe quick speech or repartee. The word has been used in the English language since the 16th century. In the 1960s the word became a slang term meaning &quot;to converse&quot; in African American vernacular, and very soon after that came to denote the musical style. The word &quot;rap&quot; is so closely associated with hip-hop music that many writers use the terms interchangeably.

Rap music has played a significant role in expressing social and political issues, addressing topics such as racism, poverty, and political oppression. By the 21st century, rap had become a global phenomenon, influencing music, fashion, and culture worldwide.

==History==
===Etymology and usage===
The English verb &quot;rap&quot; has various meanings; these include &quot;to strike, especially with a quick, smart, or light blow&quot;, as well &quot;to utter sharply or vigorously: to rap out a command&quot;. The &quot;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives a date of 1541 for the first recorded use of the word with the meaning &quot;to utter (esp. an oath) sharply, vigorously, or suddenly&quot;. Wentworth and Flexner&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of American Slang&quot; gives the meaning &quot;to speak to, recognize, or acknowledge acquaintance with someone&quot;, dated 1932, and a later meaning of &quot;to converse, esp. in an open and frank manner&quot;. It is these meanings from which the musical form of &quot;rapping&quot; derives, and this definition may be from a shortening of repartee. A &quot;rapper&quot; refers to a performer who &quot;raps&quot;. By the late 1960s, when Hubert G. Brown changed his name to H. Rap Brown, &quot;rap&quot; was a slang term referring to an oration or speech, such as was common among the &quot;hip&quot; crowd in the protest movements, but it did not come to be associated with a musical style for another decade.

&quot;Rap&quot; was used to describe talking on records as early as 1970 on Isaac Hayes&#x27; album &quot;...To Be Continued&quot; with the track name &quot;Monologue: Ike&#x27;s Rap I&quot;. Hayes&#x27; &quot;husky-voiced sexy spoken &#x27;raps&#x27; became key components in his signature sound&quot;. Del the Funky Homosapien similarly states that &quot;rap&quot; was used to refer to talking in a stylistic manner in the early 1970s: &quot;I was born in &#x27;72 ... back then what rapping meant, basically, was you trying to convey something—you&#x27;re trying to convince somebody. That&#x27;s what rapping is, it&#x27;s in the way you talk.&quot;

Rap is sometimes said to be an acronym for &quot;&#x27;R&quot;hythm &quot;A&quot;nd &quot;P&quot;oetry&#x27;, though this is not the origin of the word and so may be a backronym.

===Roots and origin===

Similarities to rapping can be observed in West African chanting folk traditions. Centuries before hip-hop music existed, the griots of West Africans were delivering stories rhythmically, over drums and sparse instrumentation. Such resemblances have been noted by many modern artists, modern day &quot;griots&quot;, spoken word artists, mainstream news sources, and academics. Rap lyrics and music are part of the &quot;Black rhetorical continuum&quot;, continuing past traditions of expanding upon them through &quot;creative use of language and rhetorical styles and strategies&quot;.

Blues, rooted in the work songs and spirituals of slavery, was first played by black Americans around the time of the Emancipation Proclamation. This way of preaching, unique to African-Americans, called the Black sermonic tradition influenced singers and musicians such as 1940s African-American gospel group The Jubalaires. The Jubalaire&#x27;s songs &quot;The Preacher and the Bear&quot; (1941) and &quot;Noah&quot; (1946) are precursors to the genre of rap music. The Jubalaires and other African-American singing groups during the blues, jazz, and gospel era are examples of the origins and development of rap music. Grammy-winning blues musician/historian Elijah Wald and others have argued that the blues were being rapped as early as the 1920s. Wald went so far as to call hip hop &quot;the living blues&quot;. A notable recorded example of rapping in blues was the 1950 song &quot;Gotta Let You Go&quot; by Joe Hill Louis.

Jazz, which developed from the blues and other African-American and European musical traditions and originated around the beginning of the 20th century, has also influenced hip hop and has been cited as a precursor of hip hop. Not just jazz music and lyrics but also jazz poetry. According to John Sobol, the jazz musician and poet who wrote &quot;Digitopia Blues&quot;, rap &quot;bears a striking resemblance to the evolution of jazz both stylistically and formally&quot;. Boxer Muhammad Ali anticipated elements of rap, often using rhyme schemes and spoken word poetry, both for when he was trash talking in boxing and as political poetry for his activism outside of boxing, paving the way for The Last Poets in 1968, Gil Scott-Heron in 1970, and the emergence of rap music in the 1970s. An editor of the newspaper, The Fayetteville Observer interviewed Bill Curtis of the disco-funk music group the Fatback Band in 2020. Curtis noted that when he moved to the Bronx in the 1970s he heard people rapping over scratched records throughout the neighborhoods and radio DJs were rapping before the genre was released on retail recordings. The Fatback Band released the first rap recording, &quot;King Tim III (Personality Jock)&quot;, a few weeks before the Sugarhill Gang in 1979. In another interview Curtis said: &quot;There was rapping in the Bronx and the cats there had been doing it for a while...Fatback certainly didn&#x27;t invent rap or anything. I was just interested in it and I guess years later we were the first to record it. At the time you could already see cats rapping everywhere in the streets and doing stuff.&quot;

With the decline of disco in the early 1980s rap became a new form of expression. Rap arose from musical experimentation with rhyming, rhythmic speech. Rap was a departure from disco. Sherley Anne Williams refers to the development of rap as &quot;anti-Disco&quot; in style and means of reproduction. The early productions of Rap after Disco sought a more simplified manner of producing the tracks they were to sing over. Williams explains how Rap composers and DJ&#x27;s opposed the heavily orchestrated and ritzy multi-tracks of Disco for &quot;break beats&quot; which were created from compiling different records from numerous genres and did not require the equipment from professional recording studios. Professional studios were not necessary therefore opening the production of rap to the youth who as Williams explains felt &quot;locked out&quot; because of the capital needed to produce Disco records.

More directly related to the African-American community were items like schoolyard chants and taunts, clapping games, jump-rope rhymes, some with unwritten folk histories going back hundreds of years across many nationalities. Sometimes these items contain racially offensive lyrics.

===Proto-rap===
In his narration between the tracks on George Russell&#x27;s 1958 jazz album &quot;New York, N.Y.&quot;, the singer Jon Hendricks recorded something close to modern rap, since it all rhymed and was delivered in a hip, rhythm-conscious manner. Art forms such as spoken word jazz poetry and comedy records had an influence on the first rappers. Coke La Rock, often credited as hip-hop&#x27;s first MC cites the Last Poets among his influences, as well as comedians such as Wild Man Steve and Richard Pryor. Comedian Rudy Ray Moore released under the counter albums in the 1960s and 1970s such as &quot;This Pussy Belongs to Me&quot; (1970), which contained &quot;raunchy, sexually explicit rhymes that often had to do with pimps, prostitutes, players, and hustlers&quot;, and which later led to him being called &quot;The Godfather of Rap&quot;.

Gil Scott-Heron, a jazz poet/musician, has been cited as an influence on rappers such as Chuck D and KRS-One. Scott-Heron himself was influenced by Melvin Van Peebles, whose first album was 1968&#x27;s &quot;Brer Soul&quot;. Van Peebles describes his vocal style as &quot;the old Southern style&quot;, which was influenced by singers he had heard growing up in South Chicago. Van Peebles also said that he was influenced by older forms of African-American music: &quot;... people like Blind Lemon Jefferson and the field hollers. I was also influenced by spoken word song styles from Germany that I encountered when I lived in France.&quot;

During the mid-20th century, the musical culture of the Caribbean was constantly influenced by the concurrent changes in American music. As early as 1956, deejays were toasting over dubbed Jamaican beats. It was called &quot;rap&quot;, expanding the word&#x27;s earlier meaning in the African-American community—&quot;to discuss or debate informally.&quot;

The early rapping of hip-hop developed out of DJ and master of ceremonies&#x27; announcements made over the microphone at parties, and later into more complex raps. Grandmaster Caz stated: &quot;The microphone was just used for making announcements, like when the next party was gonna be, or people&#x27;s moms would come to the party looking for them, and you have to announce it on the mic. Different DJs started embellishing what they were saying. I would make an announcement this way, and somebody would hear that and they add a little bit to it. I&#x27;d hear it again and take it a little step further &#x27;til it turned from lines to sentences to paragraphs to verses to rhymes.&quot;

One of the first rappers at the beginning of the hip hop period, at the end of the 1970s, was also hip hop&#x27;s first DJ, DJ Kool Herc. Herc, a Jamaican immigrant, started delivering simple raps at his parties, which some claim were inspired by the Jamaican tradition of toasting. However, Kool Herc himself denies this link (in the 1984 book &quot;Hip Hop&quot;), saying, &quot;Jamaican toasting? Naw, naw. No connection there. I couldn&#x27;t play reggae in the Bronx. People wouldn&#x27;t accept it. The inspiration for rap is James Brown and the album &quot;Hustler&#x27;s Convention&quot;&quot;. Herc also suggests he was too young while in Jamaica to get into sound system parties: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t get in. Couldn&#x27;t get in. I was ten, eleven years old,&quot; and that while in Jamaica, he was listening to James Brown: &quot;I was listening to American music in Jamaica and my favorite artist was James Brown. That&#x27;s who inspired me. A lot of the records I played were by James Brown.&quot;

However, in terms of what was identified in the 2010s as &quot;rap&quot;, the source came from Manhattan. Pete DJ Jones said the first person he heard rap was DJ Hollywood, a Harlem (not Bronx) native who was the house DJ at the Apollo Theater. Kurtis Blow also said the first person he heard rhyme was DJ Hollywood. In a 2014 interview, Hollywood said: &quot;I used to like the way Frankie Crocker would ride a track, but he wasn&#x27;t syncopated to the track though. I liked [WWRL DJ] Hank Spann too, but he wasn&#x27;t on the one. Guys back then weren&#x27;t concerned with being musical. I wanted to flow with the record&quot;. And in 1975, he ushered in what became known as the &quot;hip hop&quot; style by rhyming syncopated to the beat of an existing record uninterruptedly for nearly a minute. He adapted the lyrics of Isaac Hayes&#x27; &quot;Good Love 6-9969&quot; and rhymed it to the breakdown part of &quot;Love Is the Message&quot;. His partner Kevin Smith, better known as Lovebug Starski, took this new style and introduced it to the Bronx hip hop set that until then was composed of DJing and b-boying (or beatboxing), with traditional &quot;shout out&quot; style rapping.

The style that Hollywood created and his partner introduced to the hip hop set quickly became the standard. Before that time, most MC rhymes, based on radio DJs, consisted of short patters that were disconnected thematically; they were separate unto themselves. But by using song lyrics, Hollywood gave his rhyme an inherent flow and theme. This was quickly noticed, and the style spread. By the end of the 1970s, artists such as Kurtis Blow and the Sugarhill Gang were starting to receive radio airplay and make an impact far outside of New York City, on a national scale. Blondie&#x27;s 1981 single, &quot;Rapture&quot;, was one of the first songs featuring rap to top the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

===Old-school hip hop===

Old school rap (1979–84) was &quot;easily identified by its relatively simple raps&quot; according to AllMusic, &quot;the emphasis was not on lyrical technique, but simply on good times&quot;, one notable exception being Melle Mel, who set the way for future rappers through his socio-political content and creative wordplay.

===Golden age===

Golden age hip hop (the mid-1980s to early &#x27;90s) was the time period where hip-hop lyricism went through its most drastic transformation – writer William Jelani Cobb says &quot;in these golden years, a critical mass of mic prodigies were literally creating themselves and their art form at the same time&quot; and Allmusic writes, &quot;rhymers like PE&#x27;s Chuck D, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, and Rakim basically invented the complex wordplay and lyrical kung-fu of later hip-hop&quot;. The golden age is considered to have ended around 1993–94, marking the end of rap lyricism&#x27;s most innovative period.

==Flow==

&quot;Flow&quot; is defined as &quot;the rhythms and rhymes&quot; of a hip-hop song&#x27;s lyrics and how they interact – the book &quot;How to Rap&quot; breaks flow down into rhyme, rhyme schemes, and rhythm (also known as cadence). &#x27;Flow&#x27; is also sometimes used to refer to elements of the delivery (pitch, timbre, volume) as well, though often a distinction is made between the flow and the delivery.

Staying on the beat is central to rap&#x27;s flow – many MCs note the importance of staying on-beat in &quot;How to Rap&quot; including Sean Price, Mighty Casey, Zion I, Vinnie Paz, Fredro Starr, Del the Funky Homosapien, Tech N9ne, People Under the Stairs, Twista, B-Real, Mr Lif, 2Mex, and Cage.

MCs stay on beat by stressing syllables in time to the four beats of the musical backdrop. Poetry scholar Derek Attridge describes how this works in his book &quot;Poetic Rhythm&quot; – &quot;rap lyrics are written to be performed to an accompaniment that emphasizes the metrical structure of the verse&quot;. He says rap lyrics are made up of, &quot;lines with four stressed beats, separated by other syllables that may vary in number and may include other stressed syllables. The strong beat of the accompaniment coincides with the stressed beats of the verse, and the rapper organizes the rhythms of the intervening syllables to provide variety and surprise&quot;.

The same technique is also noted in the book &quot;How to Rap&quot;, where diagrams are used to show how the lyrics line up with the beat – &quot;stressing a syllable on each of the four beats gives the lyrics the same underlying rhythmic pulse as the music and keeps them in rhythm ... other syllables in the song may still be stressed, but the ones that fall in time with the four beats of a bar are the only ones that need to be emphasized in order to keep the lyrics in time with the music&quot;.

In rap terminology, 16-bars is the amount of time that rappers are generally given to perform a guest verse on another artist&#x27;s song; one bar is typically equal to four beats of music.

===History===
Old school flows were relatively basic and used only few syllables per bar, simple rhythmic patterns, and basic rhyming techniques and rhyme schemes.
Melle Mel is cited as an MC who epitomizes the old school flow – Kool Moe Dee says, &quot;from 1970 to 1978 we rhymed one way [then] Melle Mel, in 1978, gave us the new cadence we would use from 1978 to 1986&quot;. &quot;He&#x27;s the first emcee to explode in a new rhyme cadence, and change the way every emcee rhymed forever. Rakim, The Notorious B.I.G., and Eminem have flipped the flow, but Melle Mel&#x27;s downbeat on the two, four, kick to snare cadence is still the rhyme foundation all emcees are building on&quot;.

Artists and critics often credit Rakim with creating the overall shift from the more simplistic old school flows to more complex flows near the beginning of hip hop&#x27;s new school – Kool Moe Dee says, &quot;any emcee that came after 1986 had to study Rakim just to know what to be able to do. Rakim, in 1986, gave us flow and that was the rhyme style from 1986 to 1994. From that point on, anybody emceeing was forced to focus on their flow&quot;. Kool Moe Dee explains that before Rakim, the term &#x27;flow&#x27; was not widely used – &quot;Rakim is basically the inventor of flow. We were not even using the word flow until Rakim came along. It was called rhyming, it was called cadence, but it wasn&#x27;t called flow. Rakim created flow!&quot; He adds that while Rakim upgraded and popularized the focus on flow, &quot;he didn&#x27;t invent the word&quot;.

Kool Moe Dee states that Biggie introduced a newer flow which &quot;dominated from 1994 to 2002&quot;, and also says that Method Man was &quot;one of the emcees from the early to mid-&#x27;90s that ushered in the era of flow ... Rakim invented it, Big Daddy Kane, KRS-One, and Kool G Rap expanded it, but Biggie and Method Man made flow the single most important aspect of an emcee&#x27;s game&quot;. He also cites Craig Mack as an artist who contributed to developing flow in the &#x27;90s.

Music scholar Adam Krims says, &quot;the flow of MCs is one of the profoundest changes that separates out new-sounding from older-sounding music ... it is widely recognized and remarked that rhythmic styles of many commercially successful MCs since roughly the beginning of the 1990s have progressively become faster and more &#x27;complex&#x27;&quot;. He cites &quot;members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Nas, AZ, Big Pun, and Ras Kass, just to name a few&quot; as artists who exemplify this progression.

Kool Moe Dee adds, &quot;in 2002 Eminem created the song that got the first Oscar in Hip-Hop history [Lose Yourself] ... and I would have to say that his flow is the most dominant right now (2003)&quot;.

===Styles===
There are many different styles of flow, with different terminology used by different people – stic.man of Dead Prez uses the following terms –
*&quot;The Chant&quot;, which he says is used by Lil Jon and Project Pat
*&quot;The Syncopated Bounce&quot;, used by Twista and Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
*&quot;Straight Forward&quot;, used by Scarface, 2Pac, Melle Mel, KRS-One circa Boogie Down Productions era, Too Short, Jay-Z, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, and Snoop Dogg
*&quot;The Rubik&#x27;s Cube&quot;, used by Nas, Black Thought of The Roots, Common, Kurupt, and Lauryn Hill
*&quot;2-5-Flow&quot;, a pun of Kenya&#x27;s calling code &quot;+254&quot;, used by Camp Mulla

Alternatively, music scholar Adam Krims uses the following terms –
*&quot;sung rhythmic style&quot;, used by Too Short, Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, and the Beastie Boys
*&quot;percussion-effusive style&quot;, used by B-Real of Cypress Hill
*&quot;speech-effusive style&quot;, used by Big Pun
*&quot;offbeat style&quot;, used by E-40, Outkast

===Rhyme===
MCs use many different rhyming techniques, including complex rhyme schemes, as Adam Krims points out – &quot;the complexity ... involves multiple rhymes in the same rhyme complex (i.e. section with consistently rhyming words), internal rhymes, [and] offbeat rhymes&quot;. There is also widespread use of multisyllabic rhymes.

It has been noted that rap&#x27;s use of rhyme is some of the most advanced in all forms of poetry – music scholar Adam Bradley notes, &quot;rap rhymes so much and with such variety that it is now the largest and richest contemporary archive of rhymed words. It has done more than any other art form in recent history to expand rhyme&#x27;s formal range and expressive possibilities&quot;.

In the book &quot;How to Rap&quot;, Masta Ace explains how Rakim and Big Daddy Kane caused a shift in the way MCs rhymed: &quot;Up until Rakim, everybody who you heard rhyme, the last word in the sentence was the rhyming [word], the connection word. Then Rakim showed us that you could put rhymes within a rhyme ... now here comes Big Daddy Kane — instead of going three words, he&#x27;s going multiple&quot;. &quot;How to Rap&quot; explains that &quot;rhyme is often thought to be the most important factor in rap writing ... rhyme is what gives rap lyrics their musicality.

===Rhythm===
Many of the rhythmic techniques used in rapping come from percussive techniques and many rappers compare themselves to percussionists. &quot;How to Rap 2&quot; identifies all the rhythmic techniques used in rapping such as triplets, flams, 16th notes, 32nd notes, syncopation, extensive use of rests, and rhythmic techniques unique to rapping such as West Coast &quot;lazy tails&quot;, coined by Shock G. Rapping has also been done in various time signatures, such as 3/4 time.

Since the 2000s, rapping has evolved into a style of rap that spills over the boundaries of the beat, closely resembling spoken English. Rappers like MF Doom and Eminem have exhibited this style, and since then, rapping has been difficult to notate. The American hip-hop group Crime Mob exhibited a new rap flow in songs such as &quot;Knuck If You Buck&quot;, heavily dependent on triplets. Rappers including Drake, Kanye West, Rick Ross, Young Jeezy and more have included this influence in their music. In 2014, an American hip-hop collective from Atlanta, Migos, popularized this flow, and is commonly referred to as the &quot;Migos Flow&quot; (a term that is contentious within the hip-hop community).

=== Groove classes ===
Mitchell Ohriner in &quot;Flow: The Rhythmic Voice in Rap Music&quot; describes seven &quot;groove classes&quot; consisting of archetypal sixteen-step accent patterns generated by grouping notes in clusters of two and/or three. These groove classes are further distinguished from one another as &quot;duple&quot; and &quot;nonduple&quot;. Groove classes without internal repetition can occur in any of sixteen rhythmic rotations, whereas groove classes with internal repetition have fewer meaningful rotations. 
===Rap notation and flow diagrams===
The standard form of rap notation is the flow diagram, where rappers line-up their lyrics underneath &quot;beat numbers&quot;. Different rappers have slightly different forms of flow diagram that they use: Del the Funky Homosapien says, &quot;I&#x27;m just writing out the rhythm of the flow, basically. Even if it&#x27;s just slashes to represent the beats, that&#x27;s enough to give me a visual path.&quot;, Vinnie Paz states, &quot;I&#x27;ve created my own sort of writing technique, like little marks and asterisks to show like a pause or emphasis on words in certain places.&quot;, and Aesop Rock says, &quot;I have a system of maybe 10 little symbols that I use on paper that tell me to do something when I&#x27;m recording.&quot;

Hip-hop scholars also make use of the same flow diagrams: the books &quot;How to Rap&quot; and &quot;How to Rap 2&quot; use the diagrams to explain rap&#x27;s triplets, flams, rests, rhyme schemes, runs of rhyme, and breaking rhyme patterns, among other techniques. Similar systems are used by PhD musicologists Adam Krims in his book &quot;Rap Music and the Poetics of Identity&quot; and Kyle Adams in his academic work on flow.

Because rap revolves around a strong 4/4 beat, with certain syllables said in time to the beat, all the notational systems have a similar structure: they all have the same 4 beat numbers at the top of the diagram, so that syllables can be written in-line with the beat numbers. This allows devices such as rests, &quot;lazy tails&quot;, flams, and other rhythmic techniques to be shown, as well as illustrating where different rhyming words fall in relation to the music.

==Performance==

To successfully deliver a rap, a rapper must also develop vocal presence, enunciation, and breath control. Vocal presence is the distinctiveness of a rapper&#x27;s voice on record. Enunciation is essential to a flowing rap; some rappers choose also to exaggerate it for comic and artistic effect. Breath control, taking in air without interrupting one&#x27;s delivery, is an important skill for a rapper to master, and a must for any MC. An MC with poor breath control cannot deliver difficult verses without making unintentional pauses.

Raps are sometimes delivered with melody. West Coast rapper Egyptian Lover was the first notable MC to deliver &quot;sing-raps&quot;. Popular rappers such as 50 Cent and Ja Rule add a slight melody to their otherwise purely percussive raps whereas some rappers such as Cee-Lo Green are able to harmonize their raps with the beat. The Midwestern group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony was one of the first groups to achieve nationwide recognition for using the fast-paced, melodic and harmonic raps that are also practiced by Do or Die, another Midwestern group. Another rapper that harmonized his rhymes was Nate Dogg, a rapper part of the group 213. Rakim experimented not only with following the beat, but also with complementing the song&#x27;s melody with his own voice, making his flow sound like that of an instrument (a saxophone in particular).

The ability to rap quickly and clearly is sometimes regarded as an important sign of skill. In certain hip-hop subgenres such as chopped and screwed, slow-paced rapping is often considered optimal. The current record for fastest rapper is held by Spanish rapper Domingo Edjang Moreno, known by his alias Chojin, who rapped 921 syllables in one minute on December 23, 2008.

===Emcees===
In the late 1970s, the term emcee, MC or M.C., derived from &quot;master of ceremonies&quot;, became an alternative title for a rapper, and for their role within hip-hop music and culture. An MC uses rhyming verses, pre-written or ad lib (&#x27;freestyled&#x27;), to introduce the DJ with whom they work, to keep the crowd entertained or to glorify themselves. As hip hop progressed, the title MC acquired backronyms such as &#x27;mike chanter&#x27; &#x27;microphone controller&#x27;, &#x27;microphone checker&#x27;, &#x27;music commentator&#x27;, and one who &#x27;moves the crowd&#x27;. Some use this word interchangeably with the term &quot;rapper&quot;, while for others the term denotes a superior level of skill and connection to the wider culture.

MC can often be used as a term of distinction; referring to an artist with good performance skills. As Kool G Rap notes, &quot;masters of ceremony, where the word &#x27;M.C.&#x27; comes from, means just keeping the party alive&quot; &quot;[sic]&quot;. Many people in hip hop including DJ Premier and KRS-One feel that James Brown was the first MC. James Brown had the lyrics, moves, and soul that greatly influenced a lot of rappers in hip hop, and arguably even started the first MC rhyme.

For some rappers, there was a distinction to the term, such as for MC Hammer who acquired the nickname &quot;MC&quot; for being a &quot;Master of Ceremonies&quot; which he used when he began performing at various clubs while on the road with the Oakland As and eventually in the military (United States Navy). It was within the lyrics of a rap song called &quot;This Wall&quot; that Hammer first identified himself as M.C. Hammer and later marketed it on his debut album &quot;Feel My Power&quot;. The term MC has also been used in the genre of grime music to refer to a rapid style of rapping. Grime artist JME released an album titled &quot;Grime MC&quot; in 2019 which peaked at 29 on the UK Albums Chart.

Uncertainty over the acronym&#x27;s expansion may be considered evidence for its ubiquity: the full term &quot;Master of Ceremonies&quot; is very rarely used in the hip-hop scene. This confusion prompted the hip-hop group A Tribe Called Quest to include this statement in the liner notes to their 1993 album &quot;Midnight Marauders:

The use of the term MC when referring to a rhyming wordsmith originates from the dance halls of Jamaica. At each event, there would be a master of ceremonies who would introduce the different musical acts and would say a toast in style of a rhyme, directed at the audience and to the performers. He would also make announcements such as the schedule of other events or advertisements from local sponsors. The term MC continued to be used by the children of women who moved to New York City to work as maids in the 1970s. These MCs eventually created a new style of music called hip-hop based on the rhyming they used to do in Jamaica and the breakbeats used in records. MC has also recently been accepted to refer to all who engineer music.
=== Female rappers ===

Although the majority of rappers are male, there have been a number of female rap stars, including Lauryn Hill, MC Lyte, Jean Grae, Lil&#x27; Kim, Missy Elliott, Queen Latifah, Da Brat, Trina, Megan Thee Stallion, Nicki Minaj, Cardi B, Khia, M.I.A., CL from 2NE1, Foxy Brown, Iggy Azalea, Eve, and Lisa Lopes from TLC.

==Subject matter==
&quot;Party rhymes&quot;, meant to excite the crowd at a party, were nearly the exclusive focus of old school hip hop, and they remain a staple of hip-hop music to this day. In addition to party raps, rappers also tend to make references to love and sex. Love raps were first popularized by Spoonie Gee of the Treacherous Three, and later, in the golden age of hip hop, Big Daddy Kane, Heavy D, and LL Cool J would continue this tradition.
Hip-hop artists such as KRS-One, Hopsin, Public Enemy, Lupe Fiasco, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Jay-Z, Nas, The Notorious B.I.G. (Biggie), and dead prez are known for their sociopolitical subject matter. Their West Coast counterparts include The Coup, Paris, and Michael Franti. Tupac Shakur was also known for rapping about social issues such as police brutality, teenage pregnancy, and racism.

Other rappers take a less critical approach to urbanity, sometimes even embracing such aspects as crime. Schoolly D was the first notable MC to rap about crime. Early on KRS-One was accused of celebrating crime and a hedonistic lifestyle, but after the death of his DJ, Scott La Rock, KRS-One went on to speak out against violence in hip hop and has spent the majority of his career condemning violence and writing on issues of race and class. Ice-T was one of the first rappers to call himself a &quot;playa&quot; and discuss guns on record, but his theme tune to the 1988 film &quot;Colors&quot; contained warnings against joining gangs. Gangsta rap, made popular largely because of N.W.A, brought rapping about crime and the gangster lifestyle into the musical mainstream.

Materialism has also been a popular topic in hip-hop since at least the early 1990s, with rappers boasting about their own wealth and possessions, and name-dropping specific brands: liquor brands Cristal and Rémy Martin, car manufacturers Bentley and Mercedes-Benz and clothing brands Gucci and Versace have all been popular subjects for rappers.

Various politicians, journalists, and religious leaders have accused rappers of fostering a culture of violence and hedonism among hip-hop listeners through their lyrics. However, there are also rappers whose messages may not be in line with these views, for example Christian hip hop. Others have praised the &quot;political critique, innuendo and sarcasm&quot; of hip-hop music.

In contrast to the more hedonistic approach of gangsta rappers, some rappers have a spiritual or religious focus. Christian rap is currently the most commercially successful form of religious rap. With Christian rappers like Lecrae, Thi&#x27;sl and Hostyle Gospel winning national awards and making regular appearances on television, Christian hip hop seem to have found its way in the hip-hop family. Aside from Christianity, the Five Percent Nation, an Islamic esotericist religious/spiritual group, has been represented more than any religious group in popular hip hop. Artists such as Rakim, the members of the Wu-Tang Clan, Brand Nubian, X-Clan and Busta Rhymes have had success in spreading the theology of the Five Percenters.

===Literary technique===
Rappers use the literary techniques of double entendres, alliteration, and forms of wordplay that are found in classical poetry. Similes and metaphors are used extensively in rap lyrics; rappers such as Fabolous and Lloyd Banks have written entire songs in which every line contains similes, whereas MCs like Rakim, GZA, and Jay-Z are known for the metaphorical content of their raps. Rappers such as Lupe Fiasco are known for the complexity of their songs that contain metaphors within extended metaphors.

===Diction and dialect===

Many hip-hop listeners believe that a rapper&#x27;s lyrics are enhanced by a complex vocabulary. Kool Moe Dee claims that he appealed to older audiences by using a complex vocabulary in his raps. Rap is famous, however, for having its own vocabulary—from international hip-hop slang to regional slang. Some artists, like the Wu-Tang Clan, develop an entire lexicon among their clique. African-American English has always had a significant effect on hip-hop slang and vice versa. Certain regions have introduced their unique regional slang to hip-hop culture, such as the Bay Area (Mac Dre, E-40), Houston (Chamillionaire, Paul Wall), Atlanta (Ludacris, Lil Jon, T.I.), and Kentucky (Cunninlynguists, Nappy Roots). The Nation of Gods and Earths, aka The Five Percenters, has influenced mainstream hip-hop slang with the introduction of phrases such as &quot;word is bond&quot; that have since lost much of their original spiritual meaning. Preference toward one or the other has much to do with the individual; GZA, for example, prides himself on being very visual and metaphorical but also succinct, whereas underground rapper MF DOOM is known for heaping similes upon similes. In still another variation, 2Pac was known for saying exactly what he meant, literally and clearly.

Rap music&#x27;s development into popular culture began in the 1990s. The 1990s marked the beginning of an era of popular culture guided by the musical influences of hip-hop and rap itself, moving away from the influences of rock music. As rap continued to develop and further disseminate, it went on to influence clothing brands, movies, sports, and dancing through popular culture. As rap has developed to become more of a presence in popular culture, it has focused itself on a particular demographic, adolescent and young adults. As such, it has had a significant impact on the modern vernacular of this portion of the population, which has diffused throughout society.

The effects of rap music on modern vernacular can be explored through the study of semiotics. Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols, or the study of language as a system. French literary theorist Roland Barthes furthers this study with this own theory of myth. He maintains that the first order of signification is language and that the second is &quot;myth&quot;, arguing that a word has both its literal meaning, and its mythical meaning, which is heavily dependent on socio-cultural context. To illustrate, Barthes uses the example of a rat: it has a literal meaning (a physical, objective description) and it has a greater socio-cultural understanding. This contextual meaning is subjective and is dynamic within society.

Through Barthes&#x27; semiotic theory of language and myth, it can be shown that rap music has culturally influenced the language of its listeners, as they influence the connotative message to words that already exist. As more people listen to rap, the words that are used in the lyrics become culturally bound to the song, and then are disseminated through the conversations that people have using these words.

Most often, the terms that rappers use are pre-established words that have been prescribed new meaning through their music, that are eventually disseminated through social spheres. This newly contextualized word is called a neosemanticism. Neosemanticisms are forgotten words that are often brought forward from subcultures that attract the attention of members of the reigning culture of their time, then they are brought forward by the influential voices in society – in this case, these figures are rappers. To illustrate, the acronym YOLO was popularized by rapper, actor and RnB singer Drake in 2012 when he featured it in his own song, &quot;The Motto&quot;. That year the term YOLO was so popular that it was printed on t-shirts, became a trending hashtag on Twitter, and was even considered as the inspiration for several tattoos. However, although the rapper may have come up with the acronym, the motto itself was in no way first established by Drake. Similar messages can be seen in many well-known sayings, or as early as 1896, in the English translation of &quot;La Comédie Humaine&quot;, by Honoré de Balzac where one of his free-spirited characters tells another, &quot;You Only Live Once!&quot;. Another example of a neosemanticism is the word &quot;broccoli&quot;. Rapper E-40 initially uses the word &quot;broccoli&quot; to refer to marijuana, on his hit track &quot;Broccoli&quot; in 1993. In contemporary society, artists D.R.A.M. and Lil Yachty are often accredited for this slang on for &quot;their&quot; hit song, also titled &quot;Broccoli&quot;.

With the rise in technology and mass media, the dissemination of subcultural terms has only become easier. Dick Hebdige, author of &quot;&quot;, merits that subcultures often use music to vocalize the struggles of their experiences. As rap is also the culmination of a prevalent sub-culture in African-American social spheres, often their own personal cultures are disseminated through rap lyrics.

It is here that lyrics can be categorized as either historically influenced or (more commonly) considered as slang. Vernon Andrews, the professor of the course &quot;American Studies 111: Hip-Hop Culture&quot;, suggests that many words, such as &quot;hood&quot;, &quot;homie&quot;, and &quot;dope&quot;, are historically influenced. Most importantly, this also brings forward the anarchistic culture of rap music. Common themes from rap are anti-establishment and instead, promote black excellence and diversity. It is here that rap can be seen to reclaim words, namely, &quot;nigga&quot;, a historical term used to subjugate and oppress Black people in America. This word has been reclaimed by Black Americans and is heavily used in rap music. Niggaz With Attitude embodies this notion by using it as the first word of their influential rap group name.

==Freestyle and battle==
There are two kinds of freestyle rap: one is scripted (recitation), but having no particular overriding subject matter, and has yet evolved since the late 2000s to become the most commonly referred to style when the term &quot;freestyle&quot; is being used. Its primary focus has morphed from making up a rap on the spot, to being able to recite memorized or &quot;written&quot; lyrics over an &quot;undisclosed&quot; beat, not revealed until the performance actually begins. A variation is when a DJ or host will use multiple beats and will rotate them dynamically; it is the freestyler&#x27;s job to keep his or her flow and not appear to trip up when the beat switches. Alternatively, keeping the rhythm or flow going can be substituted by &quot;switching styles&quot;. This involves the rapper doing a variation of changing one&#x27;s voice or tone, and/or the rhythm or flow, and potentially much more. However, this must be done smoothly, else any notoriety or respect gained can very quickly be lost all together. Some rappers have multiple characters, egos, or styles in their repertoire.

The second, more difficult and respected style, has adapted the terms &quot;off the dome&quot;, or &quot;off (the) top&quot; in addition to relatively less common older references like &quot;spitting&quot;, &quot;on the spot&quot; and &quot;unscripted&quot;. Often times these terms are followed by &quot;freestyle&quot; e.g. Killer &quot;Off top Freestyle&quot; by (Artist X)! This type of rapping requires the artist to both spit their lyrics over undisclosed and possibly rotating beats, but additionally primarily completely improvise the session&#x27;s rapped lyrics. Many &quot;off top&quot; rappers inadvertently reuse old lines, or even &quot;cheat&quot; by preparing segments or entire verses in advance. Therefore, &quot;off the dome&quot; freestyles with proven spontaneity are valued above generic, always usable, or rehearsed lines or &quot;bars&quot;. Rappers will often reference places or objects in their immediate setting, or specific (usually demeaning) characteristics of opponents, to prove their authenticity and originality.

Battle rapping, which can be freestyled, is the competition between two or more rappers in front of an audience. The tradition of insulting one&#x27;s friends or acquaintances in rhyme goes back to the dozens, and was employed famously by Muhammad Ali in his boxing matches. The winner of a battle is decided by the crowd and/or preselected judges. According to Kool Moe Dee, a successful battle rap focuses on an opponent&#x27;s weaknesses, rather than one&#x27;s own strengths. Television shows such as MTV&#x27;s &quot;DFX&quot; and BET&#x27;s &quot;106 and Park&quot; host weekly freestyle battles live on the air. Battle rapping gained widespread public recognition outside of the African-American community with rapper Eminem&#x27;s movie &quot;8 Mile&quot;.

The strongest battle rappers will generally perform their rap fully freestyled. This is the most effective form in a battle as the rapper can comment on the other person, whether it be what they look like, how they talk, or what they wear. It also allows the rapper to reverse a line used to &quot;diss&quot; him or her if they are the second rapper to battle. This is known as a &quot;flip&quot;. Jin The Emcee was considered &quot;World Champion&quot; battle rapper in the mid-2000s.

==Derivatives and influence==

Throughout hip hop&#x27;s history, new musical styles and genres have developed that contain rapping. Entire genres, such as rap rock and its derivatives rapcore and rap metal (rock/metal/punk with rapped vocals), or hip house have resulted from the fusion of rap and other styles. Many popular music genres with a focus on percussion have contained rapping at some point; be it disco (DJ Hollywood), jazz (Gang Starr), new wave (Blondie), funk (Fatback Band), contemporary R&amp;B (Mary J. Blige), reggaeton (Daddy Yankee), or even Japanese dance music (Soul&#x27;d Out). UK garage music has begun to focus increasingly on rappers in a new subgenre called grime which emerged in London in the early 2000s and was pioneered and popularized by the MC Dizzee Rascal. Increased popularity with the music has shown more UK rappers going to America as well as tour there, such as Sway DaSafo possibly signing with Akon&#x27;s label Konvict. Hyphy is the latest of these spin-offs. It is typified by slowed-down atonal vocals with instrumentals that borrow heavily from the hip-hop scene and lyrics centered on illegal street racing and car culture. Another Oakland, California group, Beltaine&#x27;s Fire, has recently gained attention for their Celtic fusion sound which blends hip-hop beats with Celtic melodies. Unlike the majority of hip-hop artists, all their music is performed live without samples, synths, or drum machines, drawing comparisons to The Roots and Rage Against the Machine.

Bhangra, a widely popular style of music from Punjab, India has been mixed numerous times with reggae and hip-hop music. The most popular song in this genre in the United States was &quot;Mundian to Bach Ke&quot; or &quot;Beware the Boys&quot; by Panjabi MC and Jay-Z. Although &quot;Mundian To Bach Ke&quot; had been released previously, the mixing with Jay-Z popularized the genre further.

<text>Rock is a broad genre of popular music that originated in the United States as &quot;rock and roll&quot; in the late 1940s and early 1950s, developing into a range of different styles from the mid-1960s, primarily in the United States and the United Kingdom. It has its roots in rock and roll, a style that drew directly from the black musical genres of blues, rhythm and blues, and country music. Rock also drew strongly from genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz and other musical styles. For instrumentation, rock is typically centered on the electric guitar, usually as part of a rock group with electric bass guitar, drums, and one or more singers. Usually, rock is song-based music with a time signature and using a verse–chorus form, but the genre has become extremely diverse. Like pop music, lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or political. Rock was the most popular genre of music in the U.S. and much of the Western world from the 1950s to the 2010s.

Rock musicians in the mid-1960s began to advance the album ahead of the single as the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption, with the Beatles at the forefront of this development. Their contributions lent the genre a cultural legitimacy in the mainstream and initiated a rock-informed album era in the music industry for the next several decades. By the late 1960s &quot;classic rock&quot; period, a few distinct rock music subgenres had emerged, including hybrids like blues rock, folk rock, country rock, Southern rock, raga rock, and jazz rock, which contributed to the development of psychedelic rock, influenced by the countercultural psychedelic and hippie scene. New genres that emerged included progressive rock, which extended artistic elements, heavy metal, which emphasized an aggressive thick sound, and glam rock, which highlighted showmanship and visual style. In the second half of the 1970s, punk rock reacted by producing stripped-down, energetic social and political critiques. Punk was an influence in the 1980s on new wave, post-punk and eventually alternative rock.

From the 1990s, alternative rock began to dominate rock music and break into the mainstream in the form of grunge, Britpop, and indie rock. Further fusion subgenres have since emerged, including pop-punk, electronic rock, rap rock, and rap metal. Some movements were conscious attempts to revisit rock&#x27;s history, including the garage rock/post-punk revival in the 2000s. Since the 2010s, rock has lost its position as the pre-eminent popular music genre in world culture, but remains commercially successful. The increased influence of hip-hop and electronic dance music can be seen in rock music, notably in the techno-pop scene of the early 2010s and the pop-punk-hip-hop revival of the 2020s.

Rock has also embodied and served as the vehicle for cultural and social movements, leading to major subcultures including mods and rockers in the U.K., the hippie movement and the wider Western counterculture movement that spread out from San Francisco in the U.S. in the 1960s, the latter of which continues to this day. Similarly, 1970s punk culture spawned the goth, punk, and emo subcultures. Inheriting the folk tradition of the protest song, rock music has been associated with political activism, as well as changes in social attitudes to race, sex, and drug use, and is often seen as an expression of youth revolt against adult consumerism and conformity. At the same time, it has been commercially highly successful, leading to accusations of selling out.

==Characteristics==
The sound of rock is traditionally centered on the amplified electric guitar, which emerged in its modern form in the 1950s with the popularity of rock and roll. It was also greatly influenced by the sounds of electric blues guitarists. The sound of an electric guitar in rock music is typically supported by an electric bass guitar, which pioneered jazz music in the same era, and by percussion produced from a drum kit that combines drums and cymbals. This trio of instruments has often been complemented by the inclusion of other instruments, particularly keyboards such as the piano, the Hammond organ, and the synthesizer. The basic rock instrumentation was derived from the basic blues band instrumentation (prominent lead guitar, second chordal instrument, bass, and drums). A group of musicians performing rock music is termed as a rock band or a rock group. Furthermore, it typically consists of between three (the power trio) and five members. Classically, a rock band takes the form of a quartet whose members cover one or more roles, including vocalist, lead guitarist, rhythm guitarist, bass guitarist, drummer, and often keyboard player or another instrumentalist.
Rock music is traditionally built on a foundation of simple syncopated rhythms in a meter, with a repetitive snare drum back beat on beats two and four. Melodies often originate from older musical modes such as the Dorian and Mixolydian, as well as major and minor modes. Harmonies range from the common triad to parallel perfect fourths and fifths and dissonant harmonic progressions. Since the late-1950s, and particularly from the mid-1960s onwards, rock music often used the verse–chorus structure derived from blues and folk music, but there has been considerable variation from this model. Critics have stressed the eclecticism and stylistic diversity of rock. Because of its complex history and its tendency to borrow from other musical and cultural forms, it has been argued that &quot;it is impossible to bind rock music to a rigidly delineated musical definition.&quot; In 1981, music journalist Robert Christgau said, &quot;the best rock jolts folk-art virtues—directness, utility, natural audience—into the present with shots of modern technology and modernist dissociation&quot;.
Unlike many earlier styles of popular music, rock lyrics have dealt with a wide range of themes, including romantic love, sex, rebellion against &quot;The Establishment&quot;, social concerns, and life styles. These themes were inherited from a variety of sources such as the Tin Pan Alley pop tradition, folk music, and rhythm and blues. Christgau characterizes rock lyrics as a &quot;cool medium&quot; with simple diction and repeated refrains, and asserts that rock&#x27;s primary &quot;function&quot; &quot;pertains to music, or, more generally, noise.&quot; The predominance of white, male, and often middle class musicians in rock music has often been noted, and rock has been seen as an appropriation of Black musical forms for a young, white and largely male audience. As a result, it has also been seen to articulate the concerns of this group in both style and lyrics. Christgau, writing in 1972, said in spite of some exceptions, &quot;rock and roll usually implies an identification of male sexuality and aggression&quot;.

Since the term &quot;rock&quot; started being used in preference to &quot;rock and roll&quot; from the late-1960s, it has usually been contrasted with pop music, with which it has shared many characteristics; however, rock is often distanced from pop; the former has an emphasis on musicianship, live performance, and a focus on serious and progressive themes as part of an ideology of authenticity that is frequently combined with an awareness of the genre&#x27;s history and development. According to Simon Frith, rock was &quot;something more than pop, something more than rock and roll&quot; and &quot;[r]ock musicians combined an emphasis on skill and technique with the romantic concept of art as artistic expression, original and sincere&quot;.

In the new millennium, the term &quot;rock&quot; has occasionally been used as a blanket term including forms like pop music, reggae music, soul music, and even hip hop, which it has been influenced with but often contrasted through much of the latter&#x27;s history. Christgau has used the term broadly to refer to popular and semipopular music that caters to his sensibility as &quot;a rock-and-roller&quot;, including a fondness for a good beat, a meaningful lyric with some wit, and the theme of youth, which holds an &quot;eternal attraction&quot; so objective &quot;that all youth music partakes of sociology and the field report.&quot; Writing in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: The &#x27;80s&quot; (1990), he said this sensibility is evident in the music of folk singer-songwriter Michelle Shocked, rapper LL Cool J, and synth-pop duo Pet Shop Boys—&quot;all kids working out their identities&quot;—as much as it is in the music of Chuck Berry, the Ramones, and the Replacements.

== 1940s–1950s: Birth of rock and roll ==

===Rock and roll===

The foundations of rock music are in rock and roll, which originated in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s; the genre quickly spread to much of the rest of the world. Its immediate origins lay in a melding of various black musical genres of the time, including rhythm and blues and gospel music, with country and western.
Debate surrounds the many recordings which have been suggested as &quot;the first rock and roll record&quot;. Contenders include &quot;Strange Things Happening Every Day&quot; by Sister Rosetta Tharpe (1944); &quot;That&#x27;s All Right&quot; by Arthur Crudup (1946), which was later covered by Elvis Presley in 1954; &quot;The House of Blue Lights&quot; by Ella Mae Morse and Freddie Slack (1946); Wynonie Harris&#x27; &quot;Good Rocking Tonight&quot; (1948); Goree Carter&#x27;s &quot;Rock Awhile&quot; (1949); Jimmy Preston&#x27;s &quot;Rock the Joint&quot; (1949), also covered by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets in 1952; and &quot;Rocket 88&quot; by Jackie Brenston and his Delta Cats (in fact, Ike Turner and his band the Kings of Rhythm), recorded by Sam Phillips for Chess Records in 1951.

In 1951, Cleveland, Ohio disc jockey Alan Freed began playing rhythm and blues music (then termed &quot;race music&quot;) for a multi-racial audience, and is credited with first using the phrase &quot;rock and roll&quot; to describe the music. Four years later, Bill Haley&#x27;s &quot;Rock Around the Clock&quot; (1954) became the first rock and roll song to top &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s main sales and airplay charts, and opened the door worldwide for this new wave of popular culture. Other artists with early rock and roll hits included Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Fats Domino, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Gene Vincent. Soon rock and roll was the major force in American record sales and crooners, such as Eddie Fisher, Perry Como, and Patti Page, who had dominated the previous decade of popular music, found their access to the pop charts significantly curtailed.

Rock and roll has been seen as leading to a number of distinct subgenres, including rockabilly, combining rock and roll with &quot;hillbilly&quot; country music, which was usually played and recorded in the mid-1950s by white singers such as Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Buddy Holly and with the greatest commercial success, Elvis Presley. Hispanic and Latino American movements in rock and roll, which would eventually lead to the success of Latin rock and Chicano rock within the US, began to rise in the Southwest; with rock and roll standard musician Ritchie Valens and even those within other heritage genres, such as Al Hurricane along with his brothers Tiny Morrie and Baby Gaby as they began combining rock and roll with country-western within traditional New Mexico music. In addition, the 1950s saw the growth in popularity of the electric guitar, and the development of a specifically rock and roll style of playing through such exponents as Chuck Berry, Link Wray, and Scotty Moore. The use of distortion, pioneered by Western swing guitarists such as Junior Barnard and Eldon Shamblin was popularized by Chuck Berry in the mid-1950s. The use of power chords, pioneered by Francisco Tárrega and Heitor Villa-Lobos in the 19th century and later on by Willie Johnson and Pat Hare in the early 1950s, was popularized by Link Wray in the late 1950s.

Commentators have traditionally perceived a decline of rock and roll in the late 1950s and early 1960s. By 1959, the death of Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens in a plane crash, the departure of Elvis for the army, the retirement of Little Richard to become a preacher, prosecutions of Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry and the breaking of the payola scandal (which implicated major figures, including Alan Freed, in bribery and corruption in promoting individual acts or songs), gave a sense that the rock and roll era established at that point had come to an end.

===Global spread===
Rock quickly spread out from its origins in the US, associated with the rapid Americanization that was taking place globally in the aftermath of the Second World War. Cliff Richard is credited with one of the first rock and roll hits outside of North America with &quot;Move It&quot; (1959), effectively ushering in the sound of British rock. Several artists, most prominently Tommy Steele from the UK, found success with covers of major American rock and roll hits before the recordings could spread internationally, often translating them into local languages where appropriate. Steele in particular toured Britain, Scandinavia, Australia, the USSR and South Africa from 1955 to 1957, influencing the globalisation of rock. Johnny O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s 1958 record &quot;Wild One&quot; was one of the earliest Australian rock and roll hits. By the late 1950s, as well as in the American-influenced Western world, rock was popular in communist states such as Yugoslavia, and the USSR, as well as in regions such as South America.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, U.S. blues music and blues rock artists, who had been surpassed by the rise of rock and roll in the US, found new popularity in the UK, visiting with successful tours. Lonnie Donegan&#x27;s 1955 hit &quot;Rock Island Line&quot; was a major influence and helped to develop the trend of skiffle music groups throughout the country, many of which, including John Lennon&#x27;s Quarrymen (later the Beatles), moved on to play rock and roll. While former rock and roll market in the US was becoming dominated by lightweight pop and ballads, British rock groups at clubs and local dances were developing a style more strongly influenced by blues-rock pioneers, and were starting to play with an intensity and drive seldom found in white American acts; this influence would go on to shape the future of rock music through the British Invasion.

== 1960s: British invasion and broadening sound ==
The first four years of the 1960s has traditionally been seen as an era of hiatus for rock and roll. More recently, some authors have emphasised important innovations and trends in this period without which future developments would not have been possible. While early rock and roll, particularly through the advent of rockabilly, saw the greatest commercial success for male and white performers, in this era, the genre was dominated by black and female artists. Rock and roll had not disappeared entirely from music at the end of the 1950s and some of its energy can be seen in the various dance crazes of the early 1960s, started by Chubby Checker&#x27;s record &quot;The Twist&quot; (1960). Some music historians have also pointed to important and innovative technical developments that built on rock and roll in this period, including the electronic treatment of sound by such innovators as Joe Meek, and the elaborate production methods of the Wall of Sound pursued by Phil Spector.

===Instrumental rock and surf===
The instrumental rock and roll of performers such as Duane Eddy, Link Wray and the Ventures was further developed by Dick Dale, who added distinctive &quot;wet&quot; reverb, rapid alternate picking, and Middle Eastern and Mexican influences. He produced the regional hit &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Trippin&quot; in 1961 and launched the surf music craze, following up with songs like &quot;Misirlou&quot; (1962). Like Dale and his Del-Tones, most early surf bands were formed in Southern California, including the Bel-Airs, the Challengers, and Eddie &amp; the Showmen. The Chantays scored a top ten national hit with &quot;Pipeline&quot; in 1963 and probably the best-known surf tune was 1963&#x27;s &quot;Wipe Out&quot;, by the Surfaris, which hit number 2 and number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in 1965. Surf rock was also popular in Europe during this time, with the British group the Shadows scoring hits in the early 1960s with instrumentals such as &quot;Apache&quot; (1960) and &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot; (1961), while Swedish surf group the Spotnicks saw success in both Sweden and Britain.

Surf music achieved its greatest commercial success as vocal pop music, particularly the work of the Beach Boys, formed in 1961 in Southern California. Their early albums included both instrumental surf rock, including covers of music by Dick Dale and vocal songs, drawing on rock and roll and doo wop and the close harmonies of vocal pop acts like the Four Freshmen. The Beach Boys first chart hit, &quot;Surfin&quot; in 1961 reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; top 100 and helped make the surf music craze a national phenomenon. It is often argued that the surf music craze and the careers of almost all surf acts was effectively ended by the arrival of the British Invasion from 1964, because most surf music hits were recorded and released between 1960 and 1965.

===British Invasion===

By the end of 1962, what would become the British rock scene had started with beat groups like the Beatles, Gerry &amp; the Pacemakers and the Searchers from Liverpool and Freddie and the Dreamers, Herman&#x27;s Hermits and the Hollies from Manchester. They drew on a wide range of American influences including 1950s rock and roll, soul, rhythm and blues, and surf music, initially reinterpreting standard American tunes and playing for dancers. Bands like the Animals from Newcastle and Them from Belfast, and particularly those from London like the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds, were much more directly influenced by rhythm and blues and later blues music. Soon these groups were composing their own material, combining US forms of music and infusing it with a high energy beat. Beat bands tended towards &quot;bouncy, irresistible melodies&quot;, while early British blues acts tended towards less sexually innocent, more aggressive songs, often adopting an anti-establishment stance. There was, however, particularly in the early stages, considerable musical crossover between the two tendencies. By 1963, led by the Beatles, beat groups had begun to achieve national success in Britain, soon to be followed into the charts by the more rhythm and blues focused acts.

&quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; was the Beatles&#x27; first number one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, spending seven weeks at the top and a total of 15 weeks on the chart. Their first appearance on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on 9 February 1964, drawing an estimated 73 million viewers (at the time a record for an American television program) is considered a milestone in American pop culture. During the week of 4 April 1964, the Beatles held 12 positions on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, including the entire top five. The Beatles went on to become the biggest selling rock band of all time and they were followed into the US charts by numerous British bands. During the next two years, British acts dominated their own and the US charts with Peter and Gordon, the Animals, Manfred Mann, Petula Clark, Freddie and the Dreamers, Wayne Fontana and the Mindbenders, Herman&#x27;s Hermits, the Rolling Stones, the Troggs, and Donovan all having one or more number one singles. Other major acts that were part of the invasion included the Kinks and the Dave Clark Five.

The British Invasion helped internationalize the production of rock and roll, opening the door for subsequent British (and Irish) performers to achieve international success. In America it arguably spelled the end of instrumental surf music, vocal girl groups and (for a time) the teen idols, that had dominated the American charts in the late 1950s and 1960s. It dented the careers of established R&amp;B acts like Fats Domino and Chubby Checker and even temporarily derailed the chart success of surviving rock and roll acts, including Elvis. The British Invasion also played a major part in the rise of a distinct genre of rock music, and cemented the primacy of the rock group, based on guitars and drums and producing their own material as singer-songwriters. Following the example set by the Beatles&#x27; 1965 LP &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; in particular, other British rock acts released rock albums intended as artistic statements in 1966, including the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Aftermath&quot;, the Beatles&#x27; own &quot;Revolver&quot;, and the Who&#x27;s &quot;A Quick One&quot;, as well as American acts in the Beach Boys (&quot;Pet Sounds&quot;) and Bob Dylan (&quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;).

===Blues rock===


Although the first impact of the British Invasion on American popular music was through beat and R&amp;B based acts, the impetus was soon taken up by a second wave of bands that drew their inspiration more directly from American blues, including the Rolling Stones and the Yardbirds. British blues musicians of the late 1950s and early 1960s had been inspired by the acoustic playing of figures such as Lead Belly, who was a major influence on the Skiffle craze, and Robert Johnson. Increasingly they adopted a loud amplified sound, often centered on the electric guitar, based on the Chicago blues, particularly after the tour of Britain by Muddy Waters in 1958, which prompted Cyril Davies and guitarist Alexis Korner to form the band Blues Incorporated. The band involved and inspired many of the figures of the subsequent British blues boom, including members of the Rolling Stones and Cream, combining blues standards and forms with rock instrumentation and emphasis.

The other key focus for British blues was John Mayall; his band, the Bluesbreakers, included Eric Clapton (after Clapton&#x27;s departure from the Yardbirds) and later Peter Green. Particularly significant was the release of &quot;Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton (Beano)&quot; album (1966), considered one of the seminal British blues recordings and the sound of which was much emulated in both Britain and the United States. Eric Clapton went on to form supergroups Cream, Blind Faith, and Derek and the Dominos, followed by an extensive solo career that helped bring blues rock into the mainstream. Green, along with the Bluesbreaker&#x27;s rhythm section Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, formed Peter Green&#x27;s Fleetwood Mac, who enjoyed some of the greatest commercial success in the genre. In the late 1960s Jeff Beck, also an alumnus of the Yardbirds, moved blues rock in the direction of heavy rock with his band, the Jeff Beck Group. The last Yardbirds guitarist was Jimmy Page, who went on to form &quot;The New Yardbirds&quot; which rapidly became Led Zeppelin. Many of the songs on their first three albums, and occasionally later in their careers, were expansions on traditional blues songs.

In the United States, blues rock had been pioneered in the early 1960s by guitarist Lonnie Mack; however, the genre began to take off in the mid-1960s as acts developed a sound similar to British blues musicians. Key acts included Paul Butterfield (whose band acted like Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers in Britain as a starting point for many successful musicians), Canned Heat, the early Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, Johnny Winter, the J. Geils Band, and Jimi Hendrix with his power trios, the Jimi Hendrix Experience (which included two British members, and was founded in Britain), and Band of Gypsys, whose guitar virtuosity and showmanship would be among the most emulated of the decade. Blues rock bands from the southern states, like the Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and ZZ Top, incorporated country elements into their style to produce the distinctive genre Southern rock.

Early blues rock bands often emulated jazz, playing long, involved improvisations, which would later be a major element of progressive rock. From about 1967 bands like Cream and the Jimi Hendrix Experience had moved away from purely blues-based music into psychedelia. By the 1970s, blues rock had become heavier and more riff-based, exemplified by the work of Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, and the lines between blues rock and hard rock &quot;were barely visible&quot;, as bands began recording rock-style albums. The genre was continued in the 1970s by figures such as George Thorogood and Pat Travers, but, particularly on the British scene (except perhaps for the advent of groups such as Status Quo and Foghat who moved towards a form of high energy and repetitive boogie rock), bands became focused on heavy metal innovation, and blues rock began to slip out of the mainstream.

===Garage rock===
Garage rock was a raw form of rock music, particularly prevalent in North America in the mid-1960s and so called because of the perception that it was rehearsed in the suburban family garage. Garage rock songs often revolved around the traumas of high school life, with songs about &quot;lying girls&quot; and unfair social circumstances being particularly common. The lyrics and delivery tended to be more aggressive than was common at the time, often with growled or shouted vocals that dissolved into incoherent screaming. They ranged from crude one-chord music (like the Seeds) to near-studio musician quality (including the Knickerbockers, the Remains, and the Fifth Estate). There were also regional variations in many parts of the country with flourishing scenes particularly in California and Texas. The Pacific Northwest states of Washington and Oregon had perhaps the most defined regional sound.
The style had been evolving from regional scenes as early as 1958. &quot;Tall Cool One&quot; (1959) by the Wailers and &quot;Louie Louie&quot; by the Kingsmen (1963) are mainstream examples of the genre in its formative stages. By 1963, garage band singles were creeping into the national charts in greater numbers, including Paul Revere and the Raiders (Boise), the Trashmen (Minneapolis) and the Rivieras (South Bend, Indiana). Other influential garage bands, such as the Sonics (Tacoma, Washington), never reached the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

The British Invasion greatly influenced garage bands, providing them with a national audience, leading many (often surf or hot rod groups) to adopt a British influence, and encouraging many more groups to form. Thousands of garage bands were extant in the United States and Canada during the era and hundreds produced regional hits. Despite scores of bands being signed to major or large regional labels, most were commercial failures. It is generally agreed that garage rock peaked both commercially and artistically around 1966. By 1968, the style largely disappeared from the national charts and at the local level as amateur musicians faced college, work or the draft. New styles had evolved to replace garage rock.

===Folk rock===
By the 1960s, the scene that had developed out of the American folk music revival had grown to a major movement, using traditional music and new compositions in a traditional style, usually on acoustic instruments. In America the genre was pioneered by figures such as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger and often identified with progressive or labor politics. In the early sixties figures such as Joan Baez and Bob Dylan had come to the fore in this movement as singer-songwriters. Dylan had begun to reach a mainstream audience with hits including &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot; (1963) and &quot;Masters of War&quot; (1963), which brought &quot;protest songs&quot; to a wider public, but, although beginning to influence each other, rock and folk music had remained largely separate genres, often with mutually exclusive audiences.

Early attempts to combine elements of folk and rock included the Animals&#x27; &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot; (1964), which was the first commercially successful folk song to be recorded with rock and roll instrumentation and the Beatles &quot;I&#x27;m a Loser&quot; (1964), arguably the first Beatles song to be influenced directly by Dylan. The folk rock movement is usually thought to have taken off with the Byrds&#x27; recording of Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Tambourine Man&quot; which topped the charts in 1965. With members who had been part of the café-based folk scene in Los Angeles, the Byrds adopted rock instrumentation, including drums and 12-string Rickenbacker guitars, which became a major element in the sound of the genre. Later that year Dylan adopted electric instruments, much to the outrage of many folk purists, with his &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot; becoming a US hit single. According to Ritchie Unterberger, Dylan (even before his adoption of electric instruments) influenced rock musicians like the Beatles, demonstrating &quot;to the rock generation in general that an album could be a major standalone statement without hit singles&quot;, such as on &quot;The Freewheelin&#x27; Bob Dylan&quot; (1963).

Folk rock particularly took off in California, where it led acts like the Mamas &amp; the Papas and Crosby, Stills, and Nash to move to electric instrumentation, and in New York, where it spawned performers including the Lovin&#x27; Spoonful and Simon and Garfunkel, with the latter&#x27;s acoustic &quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot; (1965) being remixed with rock instruments to be the first of many hits. These acts directly influenced British performers like Donovan and Fairport Convention. In 1969 Fairport Convention abandoned their mixture of American covers and Dylan-influenced songs to play traditional English folk music on electric instruments. This British folk-rock was taken up by bands including Pentangle, Steeleye Span and the Albion Band, which in turn prompted Irish groups like Horslips and Scottish acts like the JSD Band, Spencer&#x27;s Feat and later Five Hand Reel, to use their traditional music to create a brand of Celtic rock in the early 1970s.

Folk-rock reached its peak of commercial popularity in the period 1967–68, before many acts moved off in a variety of directions, including Dylan and the Byrds, who began to develop country rock. However, the hybridization of folk and rock has been seen as having a major influence on the development of rock music, bringing in elements of psychedelia, and helping to develop the ideas of the singer-songwriter, the protest song, and concepts of &quot;authenticity&quot;.
===Psychedelic rock===

Psychedelic music&#x27;s LSD-inspired vibe began in the folk scene. The first group to advertise themselves as psychedelic rock were the 13th Floor Elevators from Texas. The Beatles introduced many of the major elements of the psychedelic sound to audiences in this period, such as guitar feedback, the Indian sitar and backmasking sound effects. Psychedelic rock particularly took off in California&#x27;s emerging music scene as groups followed the Byrds&#x27; shift from folk to folk rock from 1965. The psychedelic lifestyle, which revolved around hallucinogenic drugs, had already developed in San Francisco and particularly prominent products of the scene were Big Brother and the Holding Company, the Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane. The Jimi Hendrix Experience&#x27;s lead guitarist, Jimi Hendrix did
extended distorted, feedback-filled jams which became a key feature of psychedelia. Psychedelic rock reached its apogee in the last years of the decade. 1967 saw the Beatles release their definitive psychedelic statement in &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, including the controversial track &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;, the Rolling Stones responded later that year with &quot;Their Satanic Majesties Request&quot;, and Pink Floyd debuted with &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;. Key recordings included Jefferson Airplane&#x27;s &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot; and the Doors&#x27; self-titled debut album. These trends peaked in the 1969 Woodstock festival, which saw performances by most of the major psychedelic acts.

&quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; was later regarded as the greatest album of all time and a starting point for the album era, during which rock music transitioned from the singles format to albums and achieved cultural legitimacy in the mainstream. Led by the Beatles in the mid-1960s, rock musicians advanced the LP as the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption, initiating a rock-informed album era in the music industry for the next several decades.

===Progressive rock===


Progressive rock, a term sometimes used interchangeably with art rock, moved beyond established musical formulas by experimenting with different instruments, song types, and forms. From the mid-1960s, the Left Banke, the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys, had pioneered the inclusion of harpsichords, wind, and string sections on their recordings to produce a form of Baroque rock and can be heard in singles like Procol Harum&#x27;s &quot;A Whiter Shade of Pale&quot; (1967), with its Bach-inspired introduction. The Moody Blues used a full orchestra on their album &quot;Days of Future Passed&quot; (1967) and subsequently created orchestral sounds with synthesizers. Classical orchestration, keyboards, and synthesizers were a frequent addition to the established rock format of guitars, bass, and drums in subsequent progressive rock.

Instrumentals were common, while songs with lyrics were sometimes conceptual, abstract, or based in fantasy and science fiction. The Pretty Things&#x27; &quot;SF Sorrow&quot; (1968), the Kinks&#x27; &quot;Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire)&quot; (1969), and the Who&#x27;s &quot;Tommy&quot; (1969) introduced the format of rock operas and opened the door to concept albums, often telling an epic story or tackling a grand overarching theme. King Crimson&#x27;s 1969 début album, &quot;In the Court of the Crimson King&quot;, which mixed powerful guitar riffs and mellotron, with jazz and symphonic music, is often taken as the key recording in progressive rock, helping the widespread adoption of the genre in the early 1970s among existing blues-rock and psychedelic bands, as well as newly formed acts. The vibrant Canterbury scene saw acts following Soft Machine from psychedelia, through jazz influences, toward more expansive hard rock, including Caravan, Hatfield and the North, Gong, and National Health. The French group Magma around drummer Christian Vander almost single-handedly created the new music genre zeuhl with their first albums in the early 1970s.
Greater commercial success was enjoyed by Pink Floyd, who also moved away from psychedelia after the departure of Syd Barrett in 1968, with &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; (1973), seen as a masterpiece of the genre, becoming one of the best-selling albums of all time. There was an emphasis on instrumental virtuosity, with Yes showcasing the skills of both guitarist Steve Howe and keyboard player Rick Wakeman, while Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer were a supergroup who produced some of the genre&#x27;s most technically demanding work. Jethro Tull and Genesis both pursued very different, but distinctly English, brands of music. Renaissance, formed in 1969 by ex-Yardbirds Jim McCarty and Keith Relf, evolved into a high-concept band featuring the three-octave voice of Annie Haslam. Most British bands depended on a relatively small cult following, but a handful, including Pink Floyd, Genesis, and Jethro Tull, managed to produce top ten singles at home and break the American market. The American brand of progressive rock varied from the eclectic and innovative Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart and Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, to more pop rock orientated bands like Boston, Foreigner, Kansas, Journey, and Styx. These, beside British bands Supertramp and ELO, all demonstrated a prog rock influence and while ranking among the most commercially successful acts of the 1970s, heralding the era of &quot;pomp&quot; or &quot;arena rock&quot;, which would last until the costs of complex shows (often with theatrical staging and special effects), would be replaced by more economical rock festivals as major live venues in the 1990s.

The instrumental strand of the genre resulted in albums like Mike Oldfield&#x27;s &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; (1973), the first record, and worldwide hit, for the Virgin Records label, which became a mainstay of the genre. Instrumental rock was particularly significant in continental Europe, allowing bands like Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Can, Focus (band) and Faust to circumvent the language barrier. Their synthesiser-heavy &quot;krautrock&quot;, along with the work of Brian Eno (for a time the keyboard player with Roxy Music), would be a major influence on subsequent electronic rock. With the advent of punk rock and technological changes in the late 1970s, progressive rock was increasingly dismissed as pretentious and overblown. Many bands broke up, but some, including Genesis, ELP, Yes, and Pink Floyd, regularly scored top ten albums with successful accompanying worldwide tours. Some bands which emerged in the aftermath of punk, such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Ultravox, and Simple Minds, showed the influence of progressive rock, as well as their more usually recognized punk influences.

===Jazz rock===
In the late 1960s, jazz-rock emerged as a distinct subgenre out of the blues-rock, psychedelic, and progressive rock scenes, mixing the power of rock with the musical complexity and improvisational elements of jazz. AllMusic states that the term jazz-rock &quot;may refer to the loudest, wildest, most electrified fusion bands from the jazz camp, but most often it describes performers coming from the rock side of the equation.&quot; Jazz-rock &quot;...generally grew out of the most artistically ambitious rock subgenres of the late &#x27;60s and early &#x27;70s&quot;, including the singer-songwriter movement. Many early US rock and roll musicians had begun in jazz and carried some of these elements into the new music. In Britain, the subgenre of blues rock, and many of its leading figures, like Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce of the Eric Clapton-fronted band Cream, had emerged from the British jazz scene. Often highlighted as the first true jazz-rock recording is the only album by the relatively obscure New York–based the Free Spirits with &quot;Out of Sight and Sound&quot; (1966). The first group of bands to self-consciously use the label were R&amp;B oriented white rock bands that made use of jazzy horn sections, like Electric Flag, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears and Chicago, to become some of the most commercially successful acts of the later 1960s and the early 1970s.

British acts to emerge in the same period from the blues scene, to make use of the tonal and improvisational aspects of jazz, included Nucleus and the Graham Bond and John Mayall spin-off Colosseum. From the psychedelic rock and the Canterbury scenes came Soft Machine, who, it has been suggested, produced one of the artistically successfully fusions of the two genres. Perhaps the most critically acclaimed fusion came from the jazz side of the equation, with Miles Davis, particularly influenced by the work of Hendrix, incorporating rock instrumentation into his sound for the album &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; (1970). It was a major influence on subsequent rock-influenced jazz artists, including Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea and Weather Report. The genre began to fade in the late 1970s, as a mellower form of fusion began to take its audience, but acts like Steely Dan, Frank Zappa and Joni Mitchell recorded significant jazz-influenced albums in this period, and it has continued to be a major influence on rock music.

== 1970s–1980s: Commercialisation ==

Reflecting on developments that occurred in rock music in the early 1970s, Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981):
Rock saw greater commodification during this decade, turning into a multibillion-dollar industry and doubling its market while, as Christgau noted, suffering a significant &quot;loss of cultural prestige&quot;. &quot;Maybe the Bee Gees became more popular than the Beatles, but they were never more popular than Jesus&quot;, he said. &quot;Insofar as the music retained any mythic power, the myth was self-referential – there were lots of songs about the rock and roll life but very few about how rock could change the world, except as a new brand of painkiller ... In the &#x27;70s the powerful took over, as rock industrialists capitalized on the national mood to reduce potent music to an often reactionary species of entertainment—and to transmute rock&#x27;s popular base from the audience to market.&quot;

===Roots rock===
Roots rock is the term now used to describe a move away from what some saw as the excesses of the psychedelic scene, to a more basic form of rock and roll that incorporated its original influences, particularly blues, country and folk music, leading to the creation of country rock and Southern rock. In 1966, Bob Dylan went to Nashville to record the album &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;. This, and subsequent more clearly country-influenced albums, such as &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;, have been seen as creating the genre of country folk, a route pursued by a number of largely acoustic folk musicians. Other acts that followed the back-to-basics trend were the Canadian group the Band and the California-based Creedence Clearwater Revival, both of which mixed basic rock and roll with folk, country and blues, to be among the most successful and influential bands of the late 1960s. The same movement saw the beginning of the recording careers of Californian solo artists like Ry Cooder, Bonnie Raitt and Lowell George, and influenced the work of established performers such as the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Banquet&quot; (1968) and the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot; (1970). Reflecting on this change of trends in rock music over the past few years, Christgau wrote in his June 1970 &quot;Consumer Guide&quot; column that this &quot;new orthodoxy&quot; and &quot;cultural lag&quot; abandoned improvisatory, studio-ornamented productions in favor of an emphasis on &quot;tight, spare instrumentation&quot; and song composition: &quot;Its referents are &#x27;50s rock, country music, and rhythm-and-blues, and its key inspiration is the Band.&quot;
In 1968, Gram Parsons recorded &quot;Safe at Home&quot; with the International Submarine Band, arguably the first true country rock album. Later that year he joined the Byrds for &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; (1968), generally considered one of the most influential recordings in the genre. The Byrds continued in the same vein, but Parsons left to be joined by another ex-Byrds member Chris Hillman in forming the Flying Burrito Brothers who helped establish the respectability and parameters of the genre, before Parsons departed to pursue a solo career. Bands in California that adopted country rock included Hearts and Flowers, Poco, New Riders of the Purple Sage, the Beau Brummels, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Some performers also enjoyed a renaissance by adopting country sounds, including: the Everly Brothers; one-time teen idol Rick Nelson who became the frontman for the Stone Canyon Band; former Monkee Mike Nesmith who formed the First National Band; and Neil Young. The Dillards were, unusually, a country act, who moved towards rock music. The greatest commercial success for country rock came in the 1970s, with artists including the Doobie Brothers, Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt and the Eagles (made up of members of the Burritos, Poco, and Stone Canyon Band), who emerged as one of the most successful rock acts of all time, producing albums that included &quot;Hotel California&quot; (1976).

The founders of Southern rock are usually thought to be the Allman Brothers Band, who developed a distinctive sound, largely derived from blues rock, but incorporating elements of boogie, soul, and country in the early 1970s. The most successful act to follow them were Lynyrd Skynyrd, who helped establish the &quot;Good ol&#x27; boy&quot; image of the subgenre and the general shape of 1970s&#x27; guitar rock. Their successors included the fusion/progressive instrumentalists Dixie Dregs, the more country-influenced Outlaws, funk/R&amp;B-leaning Wet Willie and (incorporating elements of R&amp;B and gospel) the Ozark Mountain Daredevils. After the loss of original members of the Allmans and Lynyrd Skynyrd, the genre began to fade in popularity in the late 1970s, but was sustained the 1980s with acts like .38 Special, Molly Hatchet and the Marshall Tucker Band.

===Glam rock===

Glam rock emerged from the English psychedelic and art rock scenes of the late 1960s; it can be seen as both an extension of (and reaction against) those trends. Musically diverse, varying between the simple rock and roll revivalism of figures like Alvin Stardust to the complex art rock of Roxy Music, and can be seen as much as a fashion as a musical subgenre. Visually, it was a mesh of various styles, ranging from 1930s Hollywood glamor, through 1950s pin-up sex appeal, pre-war Cabaret theatrics, Victorian literary and symbolist styles, science fiction, to ancient and occult mysticism and mythology; manifesting itself in outrageous clothes, makeup, hairstyles, and platform-soled boots. Glam is most noted for its sexual and gender ambiguity and representations of androgyny, beside extensive use of theatrics. It was prefigured by the showmanship and gender-identity manipulation of American acts such as the Cockettes and Alice Cooper.

The origins of glam rock are associated with Marc Bolan, who had renamed his folk duo to T. Rex and taken up electric instruments by the end of the 1960s. Often cited as the moment of inception is his appearance on the BBC music show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in March 1971 wearing glitter and satins, to perform what would be his second UK Top 10 hit (and first UK Number 1 hit), &quot;Hot Love&quot;. From 1971, already a minor star, David Bowie developed his Ziggy Stardust persona, incorporating elements of professional make up, mime and performance into his act. These performers were soon followed in the style by acts including Roxy Music, Sweet, Slade, Mott the Hoople, Mud and Alvin Stardust. While highly successful in the single charts in the United Kingdom, very few of these musicians were able to make a serious impact in the United States; Bowie was the major exception becoming an international superstar and prompting the adoption of glam styles among acts like Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, New York Dolls and Jobriath, often known as &quot;glitter rock&quot; and with a darker lyrical content than their British counterparts. In the UK the term glitter rock was most often used to refer to the extreme version of glam pursued by Gary Glitter and his support musicians the Glitter Band, who between them achieved eighteen top ten singles in the UK between 1972 and 1976. A second wave of glam rock acts, including Suzi Quatro, Roy Wood&#x27;s Wizzard and Sparks, dominated the British single charts from about 1974 to 1976. Existing acts, some not usually considered central to the genre, also adopted glam styles, including Rod Stewart, Elton John, Queen and, for a time, even the Rolling Stones. It was also a direct influence on acts that rose to prominence later, including Kiss and Adam Ant, and less directly on the formation of gothic rock and glam metal as well as on punk rock, which helped end the fashion for glam from about 1976. Glam has since enjoyed sporadic modest revivals through bands such as Chainsaw Kittens, the Darkness and in R&amp;B crossover act Prince.
===Chicano rock===
After the early successes of Latin rock in the 1960s, Chicano musicians like Carlos Santana and Al Hurricane continued to have successful careers throughout the 1970s. Santana opened the decade with success in his 1970 single &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; on the &quot;Abraxas&quot; album. His third album &quot;Santana III&quot; yielded the single &quot;No One to Depend On&quot;, and his fourth album &quot;Caravanserai&quot; experimented with his sound to mixed reception. He later released a series of four albums that all achieved gold status: &quot;Welcome&quot;, &quot;Borboletta&quot;, &quot;Amigos&quot;, and &quot;Festivál&quot;. Al Hurricane continued to mix his rock music with New Mexico music, though he was also experimenting more heavily with Jazz music, which led to several successful singles, especially on his &quot;Vestido Mojado&quot; album, including the eponymous &quot;Vestido Mojado&quot;, as well as &quot;Por Una Mujer Casada&quot; and &quot;Puño de Tierra&quot;; his brothers had successful New Mexico music singles in &quot;La Del Moño Colorado&quot; by Tiny Morrie and &quot;La Cumbia De San Antone&quot; by Baby Gaby. Al Hurricane Jr. also began his successful rock-infused New Mexico music recording career in the 1970s, with his 1976 rendition of &quot;Flor De Las Flores&quot;. Los Lobos gained popularity at this time, with their first album &quot;Los Lobos del Este de Los Angeles&quot; in 1977.

===Soft rock, hard rock, and early heavy metal===

From the late -1960s, it became common to divide mainstream rock music into soft and hard rock. Soft rock was often derived from folk rock, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies. Major artists included Carole King, Cat Stevens and James Taylor. It reached its commercial peak in the mid- to late-1970s with acts like Billy Joel, America and the reformed Fleetwood Mac, whose &quot;Rumours&quot; (1977) was the best-selling album of the decade. In contrast, hard rock was more often derived from blues-rock and was played louder and with more intensity. It often emphasised the electric guitar, both as a rhythm instrument using simple repetitive riffs and as a solo lead instrument, and was more likely to be used with distortion and other effects. Key acts included British Invasion bands like the Kinks, as well as psychedelic era performers like Cream, Jimi Hendrix and the Jeff Beck Group. Hard rock-influenced bands that enjoyed international success in the later 1970s included Queen, Thin Lizzy, Aerosmith, AC/DC, and Van Halen.

Also from the late-1960s, the term &quot;heavy metal&quot; began to be used to describe some hard rock played with even more volume and intensity, first as an adjective and by the early 1970s as a noun. The term was first used in music in Steppenwolf&#x27;s &quot;Born to Be Wild&quot; (1967); the term began to be associated with pioneer bands like San Francisco&#x27;s Blue Cheer, Cleveland&#x27;s James Gang and Michigan&#x27;s Grand Funk Railroad. By 1970, three key British bands had developed the characteristic sounds and styles which would help shape the subgenre. Led Zeppelin added elements of fantasy to their riff laden blues-rock, Deep Purple brought in symphonic and medieval interests from their progressive rock phase and Black Sabbath introduced facets of the gothic and modal harmony, helping to produce a &quot;darker&quot; sound. These elements were taken up by a &quot;second generation&quot; of hard rock and heavy metal bands into the late-1970s, including: Judas Priest, UFO, Motörhead and Rainbow from Britain; Kiss, Ted Nugent, and Blue Öyster Cult from the US; Rush from Canada and Scorpions from Germany, all marking the expansion in popularity of the subgenre. Despite a lack of airplay and very little presence on the singles charts, late-1970s heavy metal built a considerable following, particularly among adolescent working-class males in North America and Europe. 

In the 1980s, bands such as Bon Jovi, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Mötley Crüe and Def Leppard saw mainstream success, with hard rock and a fusion of hard rock and heavy metal with pop. During the 1990s, hard rock saw a slight decline in popularity, save for some major hits like Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;November Rain&quot;. However, in the early-2000s, Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; saw a huge increase in popularity of rock and pop rock and helped introduce the genres to a newer fanbase.

===Christian rock===
Rock music, mostly the heavy metal genre, has sometimes been criticized by some Christian leaders, who have condemned it as immoral, anti-Christian, and even satanic. However, Christian rock began to develop in the late 1960s, particularly out of the Jesus movement beginning in Southern California; however, it emerged as a subgenre in the 1970s with artists like Larry Norman, usually seen as the first major &quot;star&quot; of Christian rock. The genre was mostly a phenomenon in the United States. Many Christian rock performers have ties to the contemporary Christian music scene. Starting in the 1980s, Christian pop performers have had some mainstream success. While these artists were largely acceptable in Christian communities, the adoption of heavy rock and glam metal styles by bands like Stryper, who achieved considerable mainstream success in the 1980s, was more controversial. Starting in the 1990s, there were increasing numbers of acts who attempted to avoid the Christian band label, preferring to be seen as groups who were also Christians, including P.O.D.

===Heartland rock===
American working-class oriented heartland rock, characterized by a straightforward musical style, and a concern with the lives of ordinary, blue-collar American people, developed in the second half of the 1970s. The term heartland rock was first used to describe Midwestern arena rock groups like Kansas, REO Speedwagon and Styx, but which came to be associated with a more socially concerned form of roots rock more directly influenced by folk, country and rock and roll. It has been seen as an American Midwest and Rust Belt counterpart to West Coast country rock and the Southern rock of the American South. Led by figures who had initially been identified with punk and New Wave, it was most strongly influenced by acts such as Bob Dylan, the Byrds, Creedence Clearwater Revival and Van Morrison, and the basic rock of 1960s garage and the Rolling Stones.

Exemplified by the commercial success of singer songwriters Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, and Tom Petty, along with less widely known acts such as Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes and Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers, it was partly a reaction to post-industrial urban decline in the East and Mid-West, often dwelling on issues of social disintegration and isolation, beside a form of good-time rock and roll revivalism. The genre reached its commercial, artistic and influential peak in the mid-1980s, with Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born in the USA&quot; (1984), topping the charts worldwide and spawning a series of top ten singles, together with the arrival of artists including John Mellencamp, Steve Earle and more gentle singer-songwriters such as Bruce Hornsby. It can also be heard as an influence on artists as diverse as Billy Joel, Kid Rock and the Killers.

Heartland rock faded away as a recognized genre by the early 1990s, as rock music in general, and blue-collar and white working class themes in particular, lost influence with younger audiences, and as heartland&#x27;s artists turned to more personal works. Many heartland rock artists continued to record with critical and commercial success, most notably Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, and John Mellencamp, although their output became more personal and experimental, no longer fitting a specific genre.

===Punk rock===

Punk rock was developed between 1974 and 1976 in the United States and the United Kingdom. Rooted in garage rock and other forms of what is now known as protopunk music, punk rock bands eschewed the perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. They created fast, hard-edged music, typically with short songs, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY (do it yourself) ethic, with many bands self-producing their recordings and distributing them through informal channels.

By late 1976, acts such as the Ramones and Patti Smith, in New York City, and the Sex Pistols and the Clash, in London, were recognized as the vanguard of a new musical movement. The following year saw punk rock spreading around the world. Punk quickly became a major cultural phenomenon in the UK. The Sex Pistols&#x27; live TV skirmish with Bill Grundy on 1 December 1976, was the watershed moment in British punk&#x27;s transformation into a major media phenomenon, even as some stores refused to stock the records and radio airplay was hard to come by. In May 1977, the Sex Pistols achieved new heights of controversy (and number two on the singles chart) with a song that referenced Queen Elizabeth II, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, during her Silver Jubilee. For the most part, punk took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. An associated punk subculture emerged, expressing youthful rebellion and characterized by distinctive clothing styles and a variety of anti-authoritarian ideologies.

By the beginning of the 1980s, faster, more aggressive styles such as hardcore and Oi! had become the predominant mode of punk rock. This has resulted in several evolved strains of hardcore punk, such as D-beat (a distortion-heavy subgenre influenced by the UK band Discharge), anarcho-punk (such as Crass), grindcore (such as Napalm Death), and crust punk. Musicians identifying with or inspired by punk also pursued a broad range of other variations, giving rise to New wave, post-punk and the alternative rock movement.

===New wave===

Although punk rock was a significant social and musical phenomenon, it achieved less in the way of record sales (being distributed by small specialty labels such as Stiff Records), or American radio airplay (as the radio scene continued to be dominated by mainstream formats such as disco and album-oriented rock). Punk rock had attracted devotees from the art and collegiate world and soon bands sporting a more literate, arty approach, such as Talking Heads and Devo began to infiltrate the punk scene; in some quarters the description &quot;new wave&quot; began to be used to differentiate these less overtly punk bands. Record executives, who had been mostly mystified by the punk movement, recognized the potential of the more accessible new wave acts and began aggressively signing and marketing any band that could claim a remote connection to punk or new wave. Many of these bands, such as the Cars and the Go-Go&#x27;s can be seen as pop bands marketed as new wave; other existing acts, including the Police, the Pretenders and Elvis Costello, used the new wave movement as the springboard for relatively long and critically successful careers, while &quot;skinny tie&quot; bands exemplified by the Knack, or the photogenic Blondie, began as punk acts and moved into more commercial territory.

Between 1979 and 1985, influenced by Kraftwerk, Yellow Magic Orchestra, David Bowie and Gary Numan, British new wave went in the direction of such New Romantics as Spandau Ballet, Ultravox, Japan, Duran Duran, A Flock of Seagulls, Culture Club, Talk Talk and the Eurythmics, sometimes using the synthesizer to replace all other instruments. This period coincided with the rise of MTV and led to a great deal of exposure for this brand of synth-pop, creating what has been characterised as a second British Invasion. Some more traditional rock bands adapted to the video age and profited from MTV&#x27;s airplay, most obviously Dire Straits, whose &quot;Money for Nothing&quot; gently poked fun at the station, despite the fact that it had helped make them international stars, but in general, guitar-oriented rock was commercially eclipsed.

===Post-punk===

If hardcore most directly pursued the stripped down aesthetic of punk, and new wave came to represent its commercial wing, post-punk emerged in the late-1970s and early-1980s as its more artistic and challenging side. In addition to punk bands, major influences included the Velvet Underground, Frank Zappa, Captain Beefheart, and the New York-based no wave scene, including James Chance and the Contortions, DNA, and Sonic Youth. Early contributors to the genre included U.S. bands Pere Ubu, Devo, the Residents, and Talking Heads.

The first wave of British post-punk included Gang of Four, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Joy Division, who placed less emphasis on art than their US counterparts and more on the dark emotional qualities of their music. Bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees, Bauhaus, the Cure, and the Sisters of Mercy, moved increasingly in this direction to found Gothic rock, which had become the basis of a major sub-culture by the early 1980s. Similar emotional territory was pursued by Australian acts like the Birthday Party and Nick Cave. Members of Bauhaus and Joy Division explored new stylistic territory as Love and Rockets and New Order respectively. Another early post-punk movement was the industrial music developed by British bands Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire, and New York-based Suicide, using a variety of electronic and sampling techniques that emulated the sound of industrial production and which would develop into a variety of forms of post-industrial music in the 1980s.

The second generation of British post-punk bands that broke through in the early 1980s, including the Fall, the Pop Group, the Mekons, Echo and the Bunnymen and the Teardrop Explodes, tended to move away from dark sonic landscapes. Arguably the most successful band to emerge from post-punk was Ireland&#x27;s U2, who incorporated elements of religious imagery together with political commentary into their often anthemic music, and by the late 1980s had become one of the biggest bands in the world. Although many post-punk bands continued to record and perform, it declined as a movement in the mid-1980s as acts disbanded or moved off to explore other musical areas, but it has continued to influence the development of rock music and has been seen as a major element in the creation of the alternative rock movement.

===Emergence of alternative rock===

The term alternative rock was coined in the early 1980s to describe rock artists who did not fit into the mainstream genres of the time. Bands dubbed &quot;alternative&quot; had no unified style, but were all seen as distinct from mainstream music. Alternative bands were linked by their collective debt to punk rock, through hardcore, New Wave or the post-punk movements. Important alternative rock bands of the 1980s in the US included R.E.M., Hüsker Dü, Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Sonic Youth, and the Pixies; in the UK, popular bands the Cure, New Order, the Jesus and Mary Chain, and the Smiths. Artists were largely confined to independent record labels, building an extensive underground music scene based on college radio, fanzines, touring, and word-of-mouth. They rejected the dominant synth-pop of the early 1980s, marking a return to group-based guitar rock.

Few of these early bands achieved mainstream success, although exceptions to this rule include R.E.M., the Smiths, and the Cure. Despite a general lack of spectacular album sales, the original alternative rock bands exerted a considerable influence on the generation of musicians who came of age in the 1980s and ended up breaking through to mainstream success in the 1990s. Styles of alternative rock in the US during the 1980s included jangle pop, associated with the early recordings of R.E.M., which incorporated the ringing guitars of mid-1960s pop and rock, and college rock, used to describe alternative bands that began in the college circuit and college radio, including acts such as 10,000 Maniacs and the Feelies. In the UK, Gothic rock was dominant in the early 1980s; however, by the end of the decade, indie or dream pop like Primal Scream, Bogshed, Half Man Half Biscuit and the Wedding Present, and what were dubbed shoegaze bands like My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Ride and Lush entered. Particularly vibrant was the Madchester scene, producing such bands as Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets and the Stone Roses. The next decade would see the success of grunge in the US and Britpop in the UK, bringing alternative rock into the mainstream.

===Grunge===
Disaffected by commercialized and highly produced pop and rock in the mid-1980s, bands in Washington state (particularly in the Seattle area) formed a new style of rock which sharply contrasted with the mainstream music of the time. The developing genre came to be known as &quot;grunge&quot;, a term descriptive of the dirty sound of the music and the unkempt appearance of most musicians, who actively rebelled against the over-groomed images of other artists. Grunge fused elements of hardcore punk and heavy metal into a single sound, and made heavy use of guitar distortion, fuzz, and feedback. The lyrics were typically apathetic and angst-filled, and often concerned themes such as social alienation and entrapment, although it was also known for its dark humor and parodies of commercial rock.

Bands such as Green River, Soundgarden, Melvins, and Skin Yard pioneered the genre, with Mudhoney becoming the most successful by the end of the decade. Grunge remained largely a local phenomenon until 1991, when Nirvana&#x27;s album &quot;Nevermind&quot; became a huge success, containing the anthemic song &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. &quot;Nevermind&quot; was more melodic than its predecessors, by signing to Geffen Records the band was one of the first to employ traditional corporate promotion and marketing mechanisms such as an MTV video, in store displays and the use of radio &quot;consultants&quot; who promoted airplay at major mainstream rock stations. During 1991 and 1992, other grunge albums such as Pearl Jam&#x27;s &quot;Ten&quot;, Soundgarden&#x27;s &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;, and Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;Dirt&quot;, along with the &quot;Temple of the Dog&quot; album featuring members of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, became among the 100 top-selling albums. Major record labels signed most of the remaining grunge bands in Seattle, while a second influx of acts moved to the city in the hope of success. However, with the death of Kurt Cobain and the subsequent break-up of Nirvana in 1994, touring problems for Pearl Jam and the departure of Alice in Chains&#x27; lead singer Layne Staley in 1998, the genre began to decline, partly to be overshadowed by Britpop and more commercial sounding post-grunge.

===Britpop===
Britpop emerged from the British alternative rock scene of the early 1990s and was characterised by bands particularly influenced by British guitar music of the 1960s and 1970s. The Smiths were a major influence, as were bands of the Madchester scene, which had dissolved in the early 1990s. The movement has been seen partly as a reaction against various US-based, musical and cultural trends in the late 1980s and early 1990s, particularly the grunge phenomenon and as a reassertion of a British rock identity. Britpop was varied in style, but often used catchy tunes and hooks, beside lyrics with particularly British concerns and the adoption of the iconography of the 1960s British Invasion, including the symbols of British identity previously used by the mods. It was launched around 1993 with releases by groups such as Suede and Blur, who were soon joined by others including Oasis, Pulp, Supergrass, and Elastica, who produced a series of successful albums and singles. For a while the contest between Blur and Oasis was built by the popular press into the &quot;Battle of Britpop&quot;, initially won by Blur, but with Oasis achieving greater long-term and international success, directly influencing later Britpop bands, such as Ocean Colour Scene and Kula Shaker. Britpop groups brought British alternative rock into the mainstream and formed the backbone of a larger British cultural movement known as Cool Britannia. Although its more popular bands, particularly Blur and Oasis, were able to spread their commercial success overseas, especially to the United States, the movement had largely fallen apart by the end of the decade.

===Post-grunge===
The term post-grunge was coined for the generation of bands that followed the emergence into the mainstream and subsequent hiatus of the Seattle grunge bands. Post-grunge bands emulated their attitudes and music, but with a more radio-friendly commercially oriented sound. Often they worked through the major labels and came to incorporate diverse influences from jangle pop, pop-punk, alternative metal or hard rock. The term post-grunge originally was meant to be pejorative, suggesting that they were simply musically derivative, or a cynical response to an &quot;authentic&quot; rock movement. Originally, grunge bands that emerged when grunge was mainstream and were suspected of emulating the grunge sound were pejoratively labelled as post-grunge. From 1994, former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl&#x27;s new band, the Foo Fighters, helped popularize the genre and define its parameters.

Some post-grunge bands, like Candlebox, were from Seattle, but the subgenre was marked by a broadening of the geographical base of grunge, with bands like Los Angeles&#x27; Audioslave, and Georgia&#x27;s Collective Soul and beyond the US to Australia&#x27;s Silverchair and Britain&#x27;s Bush, who all cemented post-grunge as one of the most commercially viable subgenres of the late 1990s. Although male bands predominated post-grunge, female solo artist Alanis Morissette&#x27;s 1995 album &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, labelled as post-grunge, also became a multi-platinum hit. Post-grunge morphed during the late 1990s as post-grunge bands like Creed and Nickelback emerged. Bands like Creed and Nickelback took post-grunge into the 21st century with considerable commercial success, abandoning most of the angst and anger of the original movement for more conventional anthems, narratives and romantic songs, and were followed in this vein by newer acts including Shinedown, Seether, 3 Doors Down and Puddle of Mudd.

===Pop-punk===
The origins of 1990s pop-punk can be seen in the more song-oriented bands of the 1970s punk movement like Buzzcocks and the Clash, commercially successful new wave acts such as the Jam and the Undertones, and the more hardcore-influenced elements of alternative rock in the 1980s. Pop-punk tends to use power-pop melodies and chord changes with speedy punk tempos and loud guitars. Punk music provided the inspiration for some California-based bands on independent labels in the early 1990s, including Rancid and Green Day. In 1994, Green Day moved to a major label and produced the album &quot;Dookie&quot;, which found a new, largely teenage, audience and proved a surprise diamond-selling success, leading to a series of hit singles, including two number ones in the US. They were soon followed by the eponymous debut from Weezer, which spawned three top ten singles in the US. This success opened the door for the multi-platinum sales of metallic punk band the Offspring with &quot;Smash&quot; (1994). This first wave of pop punk reached its commercial peak with Green Day&#x27;s &quot;Nimrod&quot; (1997) and the Offspring&#x27;s &quot;Americana&quot; (1998).

A second wave of pop-punk was spearheaded by Blink-182, with their breakthrough album &quot;Enema of the State&quot; (1999), followed by bands such as Good Charlotte, Simple Plan and Sum 41, who made use of humour in their videos and had a more radio-friendly tone to their music, while retaining the speed, some of the attitude and even the look of 1970s punk. Later pop-punk bands, including All Time Low, the All-American Rejects and Fall Out Boy, had a sound that has been described as closer to 1980s hardcore, while still achieving commercial success.

===Indie rock===

In the 1980s the terms indie rock and alternative rock were used interchangeably. By the mid-1990s, as elements of the movement began to attract mainstream interest, particularly grunge and then Britpop, post-grunge and pop-punk, the term alternative began to lose its meaning. Those bands following the less commercial contours of the scene were increasingly referred to by the label indie. They characteristically attempted to retain control of their careers by releasing albums on their own or small independent labels, while relying on touring, word-of-mouth, and airplay on independent or college radio stations for promotion. Linked by an ethos more than a musical approach, the indie rock movement encompassed a wide range of styles, from hard-edged, grunge-influenced bands like the Cranberries and Superchunk, through do-it-yourself experimental bands like Pavement, to punk-folk singers such as Ani DiFranco. It has been noted that indie rock has a relatively high proportion of female artists compared with preceding rock genres, a tendency exemplified by the development of feminist-informed Riot grrrl music. Many countries have developed an extensive local indie scene, flourishing with bands with enough popularity to survive inside the respective country, but virtually unknown outside them.

By the end of the 1990s many recognisable subgenres, most with their origins in the late 1980s alternative movement, were included under the umbrella of indie. Lo-fi eschewed polished recording techniques for a D.I.Y. ethos and was spearheaded by Beck, Sebadoh and Pavement. The work of Talk Talk and Slint helped inspire both post rock, an experimental style influenced by jazz and electronic music, pioneered by Bark Psychosis and taken up by acts such as Tortoise, Stereolab, and Laika, as well as leading to more dense and complex, guitar-based math rock, developed by acts like Polvo and Chavez. Space rock looked back to progressive roots, with drone heavy and minimalist acts like Spacemen 3, the two bands created out of its split, Spectrum and Spiritualized, and later groups including Flying Saucer Attack, Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Quickspace. In contrast, Sadcore emphasised pain and suffering through melodic use of acoustic and electronic instrumentation in the music of bands like American Music Club and Red House Painters, while the revival of baroque pop reacted against lo-fi and experimental music by placing an emphasis on melody and classical instrumentation, with artists like Arcade Fire, Belle and Sebastian and Rufus Wainwright.

===Alternative metal, rap rock and nu metal===
Alternative metal emerged from the hardcore scene of alternative rock in the US in the later 1980s, but gained a wider audience after grunge broke into the mainstream in the early 1990s. Early alternative metal bands mixed a wide variety of genres with hardcore and heavy metal sensibilities, with acts like Jane&#x27;s Addiction and Primus using progressive rock, Soundgarden and Corrosion of Conformity using garage punk, the Jesus Lizard and Helmet mixing noise rock, Ministry and Nine Inch Nails influenced by industrial music, Monster Magnet moving into psychedelia, Pantera, Sepultura and White Zombie creating groove metal, while Biohazard, Limp Bizkit and Faith No More turned to hip hop and rap.
Hip hop had gained attention from rock acts in the early 1980s, including the Clash with &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1980) and Blondie with &quot;Rapture&quot; (1980). Early crossover acts included Run DMC and the Beastie Boys. Detroit rapper Esham became known for his &quot;acid rap&quot; style, which fused rapping with a sound that was often based in rock and heavy metal. Rappers who sampled rock songs included Ice-T, the Fat Boys, LL Cool J, Public Enemy and Whodini. The mixing of thrash metal and rap was pioneered by Anthrax on their 1987 comedy-influenced single &quot;I&#x27;m the Man&quot;.

In 1990, Faith No More broke into the mainstream with their single &quot;Epic&quot;, often seen as the first truly successful combination of heavy metal with rap. This paved the way for the success of existing bands like 24-7 Spyz and Living Colour, and new acts including Rage Against the Machine and Red Hot Chili Peppers, who all fused rock and hip hop among other influences. Among the first wave of performers to gain mainstream success as rap rock were 311, Bloodhound Gang, and Kid Rock. A more metallic sound&quot;nu metal&quot;was pursued by bands including Limp Bizkit, Korn and Slipknot. Later in the decade this style, which contained a mix of grunge, punk, metal, rap and turntable scratching, spawned a wave of successful bands like Linkin Park, P.O.D. and Staind, who were often classified as rap metal or nu metal, the first of which are the best-selling band of the genre.

In 2001, nu metal reached its peak with albums like Staind&#x27;s &quot;Break the Cycle&quot;, P.O.D&#x27;s &quot;Satellite&quot;, Slipknot&#x27;s &quot;Iowa&quot; and Linkin Park&#x27;s &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;. New bands also emerged like Disturbed, Godsmack and Papa Roach, whose major label début &quot;Infest&quot; became a platinum hit. Korn&#x27;s long-awaited fifth album &quot;Untouchables&quot;, and Papa Roach&#x27;s second album &quot;Lovehatetragedy&quot;, did not sell as well as their previous releases, while nu metal bands were played more infrequently on rock radio stations and MTV began focusing on pop punk and emo. Since then, many bands have changed to a more conventional hard rock, heavy metal, or electronic music sound.

===Post-Britpop===
From about 1997, as dissatisfaction grew with the concept of Cool Britannia, and Britpop as a movement began to dissolve, emerging bands began to avoid the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. Many of these bands tended to mix elements of British traditional rock (or British trad rock), particularly the Beatles, Rolling Stones and Small Faces, with American influences, including post-grunge. Drawn from across the United Kingdom (with several important bands emerging from the north of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), the themes of their music tended to be less parochially centered on British, English and London life and more introspective than had been the case with Britpop at its height. This, beside a greater willingness to engage with the American press and fans, may have helped some of them in achieving international success. Several alternative bands that had enjoyed some success during the mid-1990s, but did not find major commercial success until the late 1990s included the Verve and Radiohead. After the decline of Britpop they began to gain more critical and popular attention. The Verve&#x27;s album &quot;Urban Hymns&quot; (1997) was a worldwide hit, and Radiohead achieved near-universal critical acclaim with their experimental third album &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997), as well as its follow-up &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000).

Post-Britpop bands have been seen as presenting the image of the rock star as an ordinary person and their increasingly melodic music was criticised for being bland or derivative. Post-Britpop bands like Travis from &quot;The Man Who&quot; (1999), Stereophonics from &quot;Performance and Cocktails&quot; (1999), Feeder from &quot;Echo Park&quot; (2001), and particularly Coldplay from their debut album &quot;Parachutes&quot; (2000), achieved much wider international success than most of the Britpop groups that had preceded them, and were some of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s, arguably providing a launchpad for the subsequent garage rock revival and post-punk revival, which has also been seen as a reaction to their introspective brand of rock.

===Post-hardcore and emo===
Post-hardcore developed in the US, particularly in the Chicago and Washington, DC areas, in the early to mid-1980s, with bands that were inspired by the do-it-yourself ethics and guitar-heavy music of hardcore punk, but influenced by post-punk, adopting longer song formats, more complex musical structures and sometimes more melodic vocal styles.

Emo also emerged from the hardcore scene in 1980s Washington, D.C., initially as &quot;emocore&quot;, used as a term to describe bands who favored expressive vocals over the more common abrasive, barking style. The early emo scene operated as an underground, with short-lived bands releasing small-run vinyl records on tiny independent labels. Emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the platinum-selling success of Jimmy Eat World&#x27;s &quot;Bleed American&quot; (2001) and Dashboard Confessional&#x27;s &quot;The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most&quot; (2003). The new emo had a much more mainstream sound than in the 1990s and a far greater appeal among adolescents than its earlier incarnations. At the same time, use of the term emo expanded beyond the musical genre, becoming associated with fashion, a hairstyle and any music that expressed emotion. By 2003 post-hardcore bands had also caught the attention of major labels and began to enjoy mainstream success in the album charts. A number of these bands were seen as a more aggressive offshoot of emo and given the often vague label of screamo.

===Garage rock and post-punk revivals===
In the early-2000s, a new group of bands that played a stripped down and back-to-basics version of guitar rock, emerged into the mainstream. They were variously characterised as part of a garage rock, post-punk or New Wave revival. Because the bands came from across the globe, cited diverse influences (from traditional blues, through New Wave to grunge), and adopted differing styles of dress, their unity as a genre has been disputed. There had been attempts to revive garage rock and elements of punk in the 1980s and 1990s; by 2000, scenes had grown up in several countries.

The commercial breakthrough from these scenes was led by four bands: the Strokes, who emerged from the New York club scene with their debut album &quot;Is This It&quot; (2001); the White Stripes, from Detroit, with their third album &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; (2001); the Hives from Sweden after their compilation album &quot;Your New Favourite Band&quot; (2001); and the Vines from Australia with &quot;Highly Evolved&quot; (2002). They were christened by the media as the &quot;The&quot; bands, and dubbed &quot;The saviours of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;, leading to accusations of hype. A second wave of bands that gained international recognition due to the movement included Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the Killers, Interpol and Kings of Leon from the US, the Libertines, Arctic Monkeys, Bloc Party, Editors, Kaiser Chiefs and Franz Ferdinand from the UK, Jet and Wolfmother from Australia, and the Datsuns and the D4 from New Zealand.

===Digital electronic rock===
In the 2000s, as computer technology became more accessible and music software advanced, it became possible to create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer. This resulted in a massive increase in the amount of home-produced electronic music available to the general public via the expanding internet, and new forms of performance such as laptronica and live coding. These techniques also began to be used by existing bands and by developing genres that mixed rock with digital techniques and sounds, including indie electronic, electroclash, dance-punk and new rave.

==2010s–present: Commercial stagnation and revival scenes==

During the 2010s, rock music declined from its position as the major popular music genre, now sharing with electronic dance and hip hop, the latter of which had surpassed it as the most consumed musical genre in the United States by 2017. The rise of streaming and the advent of technology, which changed approaches toward music creation, were cited as major factors. Ken Partridge of Genius suggested that hip-hop became more popular because it is a more transformative genre and does not need to rely on past sounds, and that there is a direct connection to the stagnation of rock music and changing social attitudes during the 2010s. Bill Flanagan, in a 2016 opinion piece for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, compared the state of rock during this period to the state of jazz in the early 1980s, &quot;slowing down and looking back.&quot;

The rock bands which had chart success in the 2010s were mostly associated with the trends that had been popular in the 2000s and earlier decades rather than reflecting new scenes and sounds. Some pop rock and hard rock bands continued to see commercial success during this period, including Ghost, Maroon 5, Twenty One Pilots, Fall Out Boy, Imagine Dragons, Halestorm, Panic! at the Disco, Black Veil Brides, Greta Van Fleet, and The Black Keys. Outside of the charts, the commercialisation of rock festivals was a major theme of the decade, with both global megafestivals such as Coachella, Glastonbury and Roskilde, and smaller-scale local festivals expanding.

In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic brought extreme changes to the rock scene worldwide. Restrictions, such as quarantine rules, caused widespread cancellations and postponements of concerts, tours, festivals, album releases, award ceremonies, and competitions. Some artists resorted to giving online performances to keep their careers active. Another scheme to circumvent the quarantine limitations was used at a concert of Danish rock musician Mads Langer: the audience watched the performance from inside their cars, much like in a drive-in theater. Musically, the pandemic led to a surge in new releases from the slower, less energetic, and more acoustic subgenres of rock music. The industry raised funds to help itself through efforts such as Crew Nation, a relief fund for live music crews organised by Livenation.

=== Psychedelic and progressive revivals ===
Psychedelic and progressive styles in rock would see a major resurgence in popularity during the 2010s and 2020s. Some of the most notable acts in neo-psychedelia originated in Australia; Kevin Parker&#x27;s Tame Impala released the single &quot;Elephant&quot; in 2012, which became a hit on alternative radio in various countries, and would be followed by the release of critically acclaimed albums by Parker such as &quot;Lonerism&quot; (2012) and &quot;Currents&quot; (2015). This new style of Australian psychedelic music not only built on the psychedelic and progressive rock acts of the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s, but also incorporated new and unique musical influences from various subgenres of rock, heavy metal, EDM, and world music. A 2014 article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; described Australia as a place where &quot;independently minded rock bands are free to develop at their own pace&quot;. Other Australian psychedelic and progressive revival acts of the 2010s and 2020s include King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard, Psychedelic Porn Crumpets, Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever, Bananagun, Jay Watson, The Murlocs, Stonefield, and Tropical Fuck Storm.

Psychedelic trends in rock have also seen a revival in Europe, with European and American stoner rock groups such as Uncle Acid &amp; the Deadbeats, Graveyard, Kadavar, All Them Witches, and True Widow performing a heavier, more riff-based version of neo-psychedelia containing stronger blues and metal influences. Europe has been described as &quot;really good&quot; for new psychedelic music, with many American stoner rock bands choosing to tour in Europe as opposed to North America.

===Pop-punk and post-punk revivals===
At the start of the 2020s, recording artists in both pop and rap music released popular pop-punk-influenced recordings, many of them produced or assisted by Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker. Representing a commercial resurgence for the genre, these acts included Machine Gun Kelly, Willow Smith, Trippie Redd, Halsey, Yungblud, and Olivia Rodrigo. The popularity of the social media platform TikTok helped spark nostalgia for the angst-driven musical style among young listeners during the pandemic. Among the most successful of these releases have been Machine Gun Kelly&#x27;s 2020 album &quot;Tickets to My Downfall&quot;, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and Rodrigo&#x27;s number-one hit single &quot;Good 4 U&quot; (2021).

In the mid-to-late 2010s and early-2020s, a new wave of post-punk bands from Britain and Ireland emerged. The groups in this scene have been described with the term &quot;Crank Wave&quot; by &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;The Quietus&quot; in 2019, and as &quot;Post-Brexit New Wave&quot; by NPR writer Matthew Perpetua in 2021. Artists that have been identified as part of the style include Black Midi, Wet Leg, Squid, Black Country, New Road, Dry Cleaning, Shame, Sleaford Mods, Fontaines D.C., The Murder Capital, Idles and Yard Act. Post-punk artists that attained prominence in the 2010s and early-2020s from other countries besides the UK included Parquet Courts, Protomartyr and Geese (United States), Preoccupations (Canada), Iceage (Denmark), and Viagra Boys (Sweden).

===Classic rock revival===
During the mid-to-late 2010s, some mainstream rock bands began to gain notoriety for performing in a back-to-basics style of rock music meant to emulate the sound of legacy acts popular on classic rock radio. The release of albums such as the Struts&#x27; &quot;Everybody Wants&quot; (2014) and Greta Van Fleet&#x27;s &quot;Anthem of the Peaceful Army&quot; (2018) saw a renewed mainstream interest in earlier rock styles of the late 1960s and 1970s, with &quot;Revolver&quot; describing this classic rock revival sound as &quot;hard-hitting, swaggering, riff-driven rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll built around a core vocal-guitar-bass-drum configuration&quot;. Other groups considered to be a part of this trend include Rival Sons, Dirty Honey, Crown Lands, Larkin Poe, and White Reaper.

==Social impact==
Different subgenres of rock were adopted by, and became central to, the identity of a large number of sub-cultures. In the 1950s and 1960s, respectively, British youths adopted the Teddy Boy and Rocker subcultures, which revolved around US rock and roll. The counterculture of the 1960s was closely associated with psychedelic rock. The mid- to late-1970s, punk subculture began in the US, but it was given a distinctive look by British designer Vivienne Westwood, a look which spread worldwide. Out of the punk scene, the Goth and Emo subcultures grew, both of which presented distinctive visual styles.

When an international rock culture developed, it supplanted cinema as the major sources of fashion influence. Paradoxically, followers of rock music have often mistrusted the world of fashion, which has been seen as elevating image above substance. Rock fashions have been seen as combining elements of different cultures and periods, as well as expressing divergent views on sexuality and gender, and rock music in general has been noted and criticised for facilitating greater sexual freedom. Rock has also been associated with various forms of drug use, including the amphetamines taken by mods in the early to mid-1960s, through the LSD, mescaline, hashish and other hallucinogenic drugs linked with psychedelic rock in the mid- to late-1960s and early-1970s; and sometimes to cannabis, cocaine and heroin, all of which have been eulogised in song.

Rock has been credited with changing attitudes to race by opening up African-American culture to white audiences; but at the same time, rock has been accused of appropriating and exploiting that culture. While rock music has absorbed many influences and introduced Western audiences to different musical traditions, the global spread of rock music has been interpreted as a form of cultural imperialism. Rock music inherited the folk tradition of protest song, making political statements on subjects such as war, religion, poverty, civil rights, justice and the environment. Political activism reached a mainstream peak with the &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot; single (1984) and Live Aid concert for Ethiopia in 1985, which, while raising awareness of world poverty and funds for aid, have also been criticised (along with similar events), for providing a stage for self-aggrandisement and increased profits for the rock stars involved.

Since its early development, rock music has been associated with rebellion against social and political norms, most in early rock and roll&#x27;s rejection of an adult-dominated culture, the counterculture&#x27;s rejection of consumerism and conformity and punk&#x27;s rejection of all forms of social convention; however, it can also be seen as providing a means of commercial exploitation of such ideas and of diverting youth away from political action.

===Role of women===

Professional women instrumentalists are uncommon in rock genres such as heavy metal although bands such as Within Temptation have featured women as lead singers with men playing instruments. According to Schaap and Berkers, &quot;playing in a band is a male homosocial activity, that is, learning to play in a band is a peer-based ... experience, shaped by existing sex-segregated friendship networks. They note that rock music &quot;is often defined as a form of male rebellion vis-à-vis female bedroom culture.&quot; (The theory of &quot;bedroom culture&quot; argues that society influences girls to not engage in crime and deviance by virtually trapping them in their bedroom; it was identified by a sociologist named Angela McRobbie.) In popular music, there has been a gendered &quot;distinction between public (male) and private (female) participation&quot; in music. &quot;Several scholars have argued that men exclude women from bands or from the bands&#x27; rehearsals, recordings, performances, and other social activities&quot;. &quot;Women are regarded as passive and private consumers of slick, prefabricatedhence, inferiorpop music ..., excluding them from participating as high status rock musicians&quot;. One of the reasons that there are mixed gender bands is that &quot;bands operate as tight-knit units in which homosocial solidaritysocial bonds between people of the same sex ... plays a crucial role&quot;. In the 1960s rock music scene, &quot;singing was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument ... simply wasn&#x27;t done&quot;.

&quot;The rebellion of rock music was a male rebellion; the womenoften, in the 1950s and &#x27;60s, girls in their teensin rock sang songs as personæ dependent on their macho boyfriends ...&quot;. Philip Auslander says that &quot;Although there were many women in rock by the late 1960s, most performed only as singers, a feminine position in popular music&quot;. Though some women played instruments in American all-female garage rock bands, none of these bands achieved more than regional success. So they &quot;did not provide viable templates for women&#x27;s on-going participation in rock&quot;. In relation to the gender composition of heavy metal bands, it has been said that &quot;[h]eavy metal performers are almost exclusively male&quot; &quot;...at least until the mid-1980s&quot; apart from &quot;...exceptions such as Girlschool&quot;. However, &quot;...now [in the 2010s] maybe more than ever–strong metal women have put up their dukes and got down to it&quot;, &quot;carv[ing] out a considerable place for [them]selves.&quot; When Suzi Quatro emerged in 1973, &quot;no other prominent female musician worked in rock simultaneously as a singer, instrumentalist, songwriter, and bandleader&quot;. According to Auslander, she was &quot;kicking down the male door in rock and roll and proving that a female &quot;musician&quot; ... and this is a point I am extremely concerned about ... could play as well if not better than the boys&quot;.

An all-female band is a musical group in genres such as rock and blues which is composed of female musicians. This is distinct from a girl group, in which the female members are vocalists, though this terminology is not universally followed.

<text>A retronym is a newer name for something that differentiates it from something else that is newer, similar, or seen in everyday life; thus, avoiding confusion between the two.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;retronym&quot;, a neologism composed of the combining forms &quot;&quot; (from Latin , &quot;before&quot;) + &quot;&quot; (from Greek , &quot;name&quot;), was coined by Frank Mankiewicz in 1980 and popularized by William Safire in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;.

In 2000, &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary&quot; (4th edition) became the first major dictionary to include the word &quot;retronym&quot;.

== Examples ==
The global war from 1914 to 1918 was referred to at the time as the &quot;Great War&quot;. However, after the subsequent global war erupted in 1939, the phrase &quot;Great War&quot; was gradually deprecated. The first came to be known as &quot;World War I&quot; and the second as &quot;World War II&quot;.

The first bicycles with two wheels of equal size were called &quot;safety bicycles&quot; because they were easier to handle than the then-dominant style that had one large wheel and one small wheel, which then became known as an &quot;ordinary&quot; bicycle. Since the end of the 19th century, most bicycles have been expected to have two equal-sized wheels, and the other type has been renamed &quot;penny-farthing&quot; or &quot;high-wheeler&quot; bicycle.

The Atari Video Computer System platform was rebranded the &quot;Atari 2600&quot; (after its product code, CX-2600) in 1982 following the launch of its successor, the Atari 5200, and all hardware and software related to the platform were released under this new branding from that point on. Prior to that time, Atari often used the initialism &quot;VCS&quot; in official literature and other media, but colloquially the Video Computer System was often simply called &quot;the Atari.&quot;

The first film in the Star Wars franchise released in 1977 was simply titled &quot;Star Wars&quot;. It was given the subtitle &quot;Episode IV: A New Hope&quot; for its 1981 theatrical re-release, shortly after the release of its sequel &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; in 1980. Initially, this subtitle was limited to the opening text crawl, as all three films in the original Star Wars trilogy (&quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;) were still sold under their original theatrical titles on home media formats (such as VHS and Laserdisc). It was not until their 2004 DVD releases that the titles of the individual three films were changed to follow the same titling pattern as the Star Wars prequel trilogy (e.g. &quot;Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope&quot;).

In the 1990s, when the Internet became widely popular and email accounts&#x27; instant delivery common, mail carried by the postal service came to be called &quot;snail mail&quot; for its slower delivery and email sometimes just &quot;mail.&quot;

Advances in technology and science are often responsible for the coinage of retronyms. For example, the term acoustic guitar was coined with the advent of the electric guitar, analog watch was introduced to distinguish from the digital watch, push bike was created to distinguish from the motorized bicycle, and feature phone was coined to distinguish from the smartphone. Likewise, visible light refers to electromagnetic radiation on the narrow visible spectrum, and water ice was coined to distinguish the solid state of water (including exotic forms) from the solid state of other volatiles such as carbon dioxide and argon.

<text>Rush Hudson Limbaugh III ( ; January 12, 1951 – February 17, 2021) was an American conservative political commentator who was the host of &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot;, which first aired in 1984 and was nationally syndicated on AM and FM radio stations from 1988 until his death in 2021.

Limbaugh became one of the most prominent conservative voices in the United States during the 1990s and hosted a national television show from 1992 to 1996. He was among the most highly paid figures in American radio history; in 2018 &quot;Forbes&quot; listed his earnings at $84.5 million. In December 2019, &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot; estimated that Limbaugh&#x27;s show attracted a cumulative weekly audience of 15.5 million listeners to become the most-listened-to radio show in the United States. Limbaugh also wrote seven books; his first two, &quot;The Way Things Ought to Be&quot; (1992) and &quot;See, I Told You So&quot; (1993), made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

Limbaugh garnered controversy from his statements on race, LGBT matters, feminism, sexual consent, and climate change. In 1993, he was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame and in 1998 the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame. During the 2020 State of the Union Address, President Donald Trump awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Early life==

Limbaugh was born on January 12, 1951, in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to parents Rush Hudson Limbaugh II and Mildred Carolyn () Limbaugh. He and his younger brother David were born into the prominent political Limbaugh family; his father was a lawyer and a United States fighter pilot who served in the China Burma India Theater of World War II. His mother was from Searcy, Arkansas. The name &quot;Rush&quot; was originally chosen for his grandfather to honor the maiden name of a family member, Edna Rush.

Limbaugh was partly of German ancestry. The family includes many lawyers, including his grandfather, father and brother; his uncle, Stephen N. Limbaugh Sr., was a federal judge in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. His cousin, Stephen N. Limbaugh Jr., is a judge in the same court, appointed by George W. Bush. Limbaugh&#x27;s grandfather, Rush Limbaugh Sr., was a Missouri prosecutor, judge, special commissioner, member of the Missouri House of Representatives in the 1930s, and longtime president of the Missouri Historical Society.

In 1969, Limbaugh graduated from Cape Girardeau Central High School, where he played football and was a Boys State delegate. At age 16, he worked his first radio job at KGMO, a local radio station. He used the airname Rusty Sharpe having found &quot;Sharpe&quot; in a telephone book. Limbaugh later cited Chicago DJ Larry Lujack as a major influence on him, saying Lujack was &quot;the only person I ever copied.&quot; In deference to his parents&#x27; desire that he attend college, he enrolled at Southeast Missouri State University but dropped out after two semesters. According to his mother, &quot;he flunked everything [...] he just didn&#x27;t seem interested in anything except radio.&quot; Biographer Zev Chafets asserts that Limbaugh&#x27;s life was in large part dedicated to gaining his father&#x27;s respect.

==Career==

===1971–1988: Early radio career===
In February 1971, after dropping out of college, the 20-year-old Limbaugh accepted an offer to DJ at WIXZ, a Top 40 station in McKeesport, Pennsylvania. He adopted the airname &quot;Bachelor Jeff&quot; Christie and worked afternoons before moving to morning drive. The station&#x27;s general manager compared Limbaugh&#x27;s style at this time to &quot;early Imus&quot;. In 1973, after eighteen months at WIXZ, Limbaugh was fired from the station due to &quot;personality conflict&quot; with the program director. He then started a nighttime position at KQV in Pittsburgh, succeeding Jim Quinn. In late 1974, Limbaugh was dismissed after new management put pressure on the program director to fire him. Limbaugh recalled the general manager telling him that he would never land success as an air personality and suggested a career in radio sales. After rejecting his only offer at the time, a position in Neenah, Wisconsin, Limbaugh returned to living with his parents in Cape Girardeau. During this time, he became a lifelong fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

In 1975, Limbaugh began an afternoon show at the Top 40 station KUDL in Kansas City, Missouri. He soon became the host of a public affairs talk program that aired on weekend mornings which allowed him to develop his style and present more controversial ideas. In 1977, he was let go from the station but remained in Kansas City to start an evening show at KFIX. The stint was short-lived, however, and disagreements with management led to his dismissal weeks later. By this time, Limbaugh had become disillusioned with radio and felt pressure to pursue a different career. He looked back on himself as &quot;a moderate failure [...] as a deejay&quot;. In 1979, he accepted a part-time role in group sales for the Kansas City Royals baseball team which developed into a full-time position as director of group sales and special events. He worked from the Royals Stadium. There he developed a friendship with then-Royals star third baseman and future Hall of Famer George Brett. The two men remained close friends. Limbaugh said that business trips to Europe and Asia during this time developed his conservative views as he considered countries in those geographic areas to have lower standards of living than the United States.

In November 1983, Limbaugh returned to radio at KMBZ (AM) in Kansas City for a year. He decided to drop his on-air moniker and broadcast under his real name. He was fired from the station, but weeks later he landed a spot on KFBK in Sacramento, California, replacing Morton Downey Jr. The show launched on October 14, 1984. Limbaugh began to express his political opinions in 1985 when he mocked the Great Peace March for Global Nuclear Disarmament, which he considered along with the general anti-war movement to be &quot;inherently anti-US, yet was reported as substantive and morally correct by a willing and sympathetic media&quot;. The FCC&#x27;s repeal of the fairness doctrine—which had required that stations provide free air time for responses to any controversial opinions that were broadcast—on August 5, 1987, meant stations could broadcast editorial commentary without having to present opposing views. Daniel Henninger wrote, in a &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; editorial, &quot;Ronald Reagan tore down this wall [the fairness doctrine] in 1987 ... and Rush Limbaugh was the first man to proclaim himself liberated from the East Germany of liberal media domination.&quot;

===1988–1990s: WABC New York City, syndication, and tie brand===
In 1988, former ABC Radio Network executive Ed McLaughlin offered Limbaugh the nationally syndicated 12pm–2pm slot at ABC Radio Network to replace Owen Spann. Since many local radio stations of the time were hesitant to carry nationally syndicated programming during the daytime, he also secured Limbaugh a separate 10am–12pm show at WABC-AM in New York City to satisfy the provision of his contract requiring employment in a Top 5 market to leave KMBZ.

Limbaugh began his new show at WABC-AM on July 4, 1988, with the first episode focusing on the Iran Air Flight 655 shootdown the previous day. His national program debuted on 50 stations the next month on August 1, and by three months later had expanded to 100 stations. He debuted just weeks after the Democratic National Convention, and just weeks before the Republican National Convention. Limbaugh&#x27;s radio home in New York City was the talk-formatted WABC (AM), and this remained his flagship station for many years, even after Limbaugh moved to West Palm Beach, Florida, from where he broadcast his show. Limbaugh&#x27;s show moved on January 1, 2014, to WABC&#x27;s cross-town rival WOR (AM), its final New York outlet.

By 1990, Limbaugh had been on his &quot;Rush to Excellence Tour&quot;, a series of personal appearances in cities nationwide, for two years. For the 45 shows he completed that year alone, he was estimated to make around $360,000.

In December 1990, journalist Lewis Grossberger wrote in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; that Limbaugh had &quot;more listeners than any other talk show host&quot; and described Limbaugh&#x27;s style as &quot;bouncing between earnest lecturer and political vaudevillian&quot;. Limbaugh&#x27;s rising profile coincided with the Gulf War, coupled with a stalwart support for the war effort and relentless ridicule of peace activists. The program was moved to stations with larger audiences, eventually being broadcast on over 650 radio stations nationwide.

By the 1992 United States presidential election, Limbaugh had established himself as an influential political commentator. During the Republican Party presidential primaries, Limbaugh expressed a preference for Pat Buchanan over the incumbent George H. W. Bush, which Buchanan himself attributed to his early success in the primaries. Bush&#x27;s campaign subsequently worked to court Limbaugh, culminating with an invitation to stay overnight at the White House&#x27;s Lincoln Bedroom. Limbaugh was also given a seat at the president&#x27;s box in the Houston Astrodome during the 1992 Republican National Convention, and both President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle appeared on Limbaugh&#x27;s program.

In November 1992, Democrat Bill Clinton was elected President of the United States. Limbaugh satirized the policies of Clinton and First Lady Hillary Clinton, as well as those of the Democratic Party in general. Following the Republican Revolution, in which the party regained control of Congress in the 1994 midterm elections after several decades, the freshman Republican class awarded Limbaugh an honorary membership in their caucus, crediting him with having had a role in their success.

In 1995, Limbaugh started selling a line of neckties under the brand No Boundaries Collection, designed by his then-wife Marta without themes, ties to politics, or ties to issues. Limbaugh complained about coverage of the line, which he said underrated the ties&#x27; radicalness, and said media descriptions were emblematic of their general inaccuracy. Sold in nearly 1,500 retail outlets by 1996, the brand sold more than $5,000,000 worth in the first year. The New York Times described the designs: &quot;Much like their promulgator, Mr. Limbaugh&#x27;s four dozen or so styles seem designed to evoke maximum sensory outrage. Like Rainbow Black, whose interweaving rainbow strands and blue raindrops play around an Ionic column, atop which a cranberry-red pomegranate tree sprouts from an urn. Or Triangle Red, with colliding stacks of black-and-yellow triangles and disjointed horizontal black stripes on a background of speckled salmon.&quot; In 2000, Limbaugh rented the email list collected from the No Boundaries website to Rudy Giuliani&#x27;s senate campaign. The business dissolved along with his marriage to Marta but in 2020 the ties were still being sold by TieGal, Inc. for $29 each.

===2000s===
Limbaugh had publicized personal difficulties in the 2000s. In late 2001, he acknowledged that he had become almost completely deaf, although he continued his show. He was able to regain much of his hearing with the help of a cochlear implant in 2001.

In 2003, Limbaugh had a brief stint as a professional football commentator with ESPN. He resigned a few weeks into the 2003 NFL season after making comments about the press coverage for quarterback Donovan McNabb that caused controversy and accusations of racism on the part of Limbaugh. His comment about McNabb was:

I don&#x27;t think he&#x27;s been that good from the get-go. I think what we&#x27;ve had here is a little social concern in the NFL. I think the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well. They&#x27;re interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well. I think there&#x27;s a little hope invested in McNabb and he got a lot of credit for the performance of his team that he really didn&#x27;t deserve. The defense carried this team.

The sportswriter Peter King construed the comment as &quot;boneheaded&quot;. The sports analyst Allen Barra wrote Limbaugh&#x27;s viewpoint was shared by &quot;many football fans and analysts&quot; and &quot;it is... absurd to say that the sports media haven&#x27;t overrated Donovan McNabb because he&#x27;s black&quot;.
In 2003, Limbaugh stated that he was addicted to pain medication, and sought treatment. In April 2006, Limbaugh turned himself in to authorities, on a warrant issued by the Palm Beach County state attorney&#x27;s office, and was arrested &quot;on a single charge of prescription fraud&quot;. His record was later expunged.

===2010s===
In 2013, news reports indicated that Cumulus Media, some of whose stations carried Limbaugh&#x27;s program in certain major markets, including New York, Chicago, Dallas, Washington D.C., and Detroit, was considering dropping his show when its contract with Limbaugh expired at the end of that year, reportedly because the company believed that its advertising revenues had been hurt by listener reaction to controversial Limbaugh comments. Limbaugh himself said that the reports were overblown and that it was a matter of routine dollars-and-cents negotiations between Cumulus and his network syndication partner, Premiere Networks, a unit of Clear Channel Communications. Ultimately, the parties reached agreement on a new contract, with Limbaugh&#x27;s show moving from its long-time flagship outlet in New York, the Cumulus-owned WABC, to the latter&#x27;s cross-town rival, the Clear Channel-owned WOR, starting January 1, 2014, but remaining on the Cumulus-owned stations it was being carried on in other markets.

===2020s===
In January 2021, Limbaugh called the GameStop short squeeze &quot;the most fascinating thing&quot; to happen in a long time and said that &quot;the elites are bent out of shape that a bunch of average, ordinary users have figured out how to make themselves billionaires&quot;.

===&quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot;===

Limbaugh&#x27;s radio show aired for three hours each weekday beginning at noon Eastern Time on both AM and FM radio. The program was also broadcast worldwide on the Armed Forces Radio Network.

Radio broadcasting shifted from AM to FM in the 1970s because of the opportunity to broadcast music in stereo with better fidelity (AM stations in the United States would not get the opportunity to broadcast in stereo sound until August 2, 1982). Limbaugh&#x27;s show was first nationally syndicated in August 1988, on the AM radio band. Limbaugh&#x27;s popularity paved the way for other conservative talk radio programming to become commonplace on AM radio. The show increased its audience in the 1990s to the extent that even some FM stations picked it up. about half of Limbaugh&#x27;s affiliate stations were on the FM dial.

Limbaugh used props, songs, and photos to introduce his monologues on various topics. On his radio show, news about homeless people was often preceded by the Clarence &quot;Frogman&quot; Henry song &quot;Ain&#x27;t Got No Home&quot;.

In March 2006, WBAL in Baltimore became the first major market radio station in the country to drop Limbaugh&#x27;s nationally syndicated radio program. In 2007, &quot;TALKERS Magazine&quot; again named him No.1 in its &quot;Heavy Hundred&quot; most important talk show hosts.

Limbaugh frequently mentioned the EIB (Excellence In Broadcasting) Network, trademarked in 1990. In the beginning, his show was co-owned and first syndicated by Edward F. McLaughlin, former president of ABC, who founded EFM Media in 1988, with Limbaugh&#x27;s show as his first product. In 1997, McLaughlin sold EFM to Jacor Communications, which was ultimately bought up by Clear Channel Communications. Limbaugh owned a majority of the show, which is syndicated by the Premiere Radio Networks.

According to a 2001 article in &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, Limbaugh had an eight-year contract, at the rate of $31.25 million a year. In 2007, Limbaugh earned $33 million. A November 2008 poll by Zogby International found that Limbaugh was the most trusted news personality in the nation, garnering 12.5 percent of poll responses.

Limbaugh signed a $400-million, eight-year contract in 2008 with what was then Clear Channel Communications, making him the highest-paid broadcaster on terrestrial radio. On August 2, 2016, Limbaugh signed a four-year extension of the 2008 contract. At the announcement of the extension, Premiere Radio Networks and iHeartMedia announced that his show experienced audience growth with 18% growth in adults 25–54, 27% growth with 25–54 women, and ad revenue growth of 20% year over year.

In 2018, Limbaugh was the world&#x27;s second (behind Howard Stern) highest-paid radio host, reportedly earning $84.5 million. On January 5, 2020, Limbaugh renewed his contract again. Though media reports said it was &quot;a long-term&quot; renewal, (with no length specified), according to Donald Trump it was a four-year deal.

Regular guest host Ken Matthews was also selected a &quot;TALKERS Magazine&quot; &quot;Heavy Hundred&quot;.

In May, Premiere Networks announced that on June 21, 2021, The Limbaugh Show radio timeslot will be taken over by Clay Travis and Buck Sexton in hundreds of markets.

===Television show===
Limbaugh had a syndicated half-hour television show from 1992 through 1996, produced by Roger Ailes. The show discussed many of the topics on his radio show, and was taped in front of an audience. In the months after its debut on September 12, 1992, it was the third highest rated late-night television show after &quot;Nightline&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. Limbaugh said he loved doing his radio show, but not a TV show.

===Other media appearances===
Limbaugh&#x27;s first television hosting experience came March 30, 1990, as a guest host on Pat Sajak&#x27;s CBS late-night talk show, &quot;The Pat Sajak Show&quot;. ACT UP activists in the audience heckled Limbaugh repeatedly; ultimately the entire studio audience was cleared. In 2001, Sajak said the incident was &quot;legendary around CBS&quot;.

On December 17, 1993, Limbaugh appeared on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;. Limbaugh also guest-starred (as himself) on a 1994 episode of &quot;Hearts Afire&quot;. He appeared in the 1995 Billy Crystal film &quot;Forget Paris&quot;, and in 1998 on an episode of &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;.

In 2007, Limbaugh made cameo appearances on Fox News Channel&#x27;s short-lived &quot;The 1/2 Hour News Hour&quot; in a series of parodies portraying him as the future President of the United States. In the parodies, his vice president was fellow conservative pundit Ann Coulter. That year, he also made a cameo in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;, a parody of &quot;Star Wars&quot; in which Limbaugh can be heard on the radio claiming that the &quot;liberal galactic media&quot; were lying about climate change on the planet Hoth, and that Lando Calrissian&#x27;s administrative position on Cloud City was a result of affirmative action. His later appearances on &quot;Family Guy&quot; were in the 2010 episode &quot;Excellence in Broadcasting&quot;, and 2011&#x27;s &quot;Episode VI: It&#x27;s a Trap!&quot;, a parody of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

==Views==
In his first &quot;New York Times&quot; best seller, Limbaugh described himself as conservative, and was critical of broadcasters in many media outlets for claiming to be objective. He called for the adoption of core conservative philosophies in order to ensure the survival of the Republican Party. Limbaugh criticized the media and political activist movements such as feminism, environmentalism, and animal rights for allegedly serving as outlets for &quot;anticapitalism, secular humanism, and socialism.&quot; Limbaugh, a proponent of American exceptionalism, often criticized politicians he believed reject this notion seeing them as unpatriotic or anti-American.

===Race===
Limbaugh was known for making controversial race-related statements regarding African Americans. He once opined that all newspaper composite pictures of wanted criminals resembled Jesse Jackson, and another time that &quot;the NFL all too often looks like a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons.&quot; While employed as what he describes as an &quot;insult-radio&quot; DJ, he used a derogatory racial stereotype to characterize a black caller he could not understand, telling the caller to &quot;take that bone out of your nose and call me back&quot;, although he expressed guilt over this when recounting it. Limbaugh asserted in 2008 that African Americans, in contrast with other minority groups, are &quot;left behind&quot; socially because they have been systematically trained from a young age to hate the United States because of the welfare state.

Limbaugh argued that liberal politicians have encouraged immigration from Latin America but have discouraged their assimilation to deliberately create racial inequality to manipulate as a voter base, and that their continued admission will cause a collapse of representative democracy and rule of law in the United States. He criticized the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 for this reason.

He said of the genocide of Native Americans, &quot;Holocaust 90 million Indians? Only 4 million left? They all have casinos, what’s to complain about?&quot;

=== Taxes ===
James Fallows described Limbaugh&#x27;s economic ideology as &quot;a doctrinaire version of supply-side economics&quot; and noted that he frequently cited &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; in his radio shows and books. Limbaugh has called for fewer taxes, including progressive taxes targeted towards the wealthy, and argued the wealthy were being taxed excessively because they continued to pay the majority of taxes in the United States. Limbaugh further claimed that reductions in marginal tax rates would reduce poverty and inequality by removing obstacles towards economic growth, and that reducing marginal tax rates on the wealthy would increase tax revenue by increasing production. Limbaugh credited Reagan&#x27;s tax cuts for ending the early 1980s recession, and blamed the early 1990s recession and rising rates of inequality on the American middle-class being &quot;taxed at a confiscatory rate.&quot;

=== LGBT and AIDS ===
Limbaugh expressed anti-LGBT views and viewed homosexual sexual practices as unhygienic. He made serophobic statements about HIV/AIDS victims in the 1980s and 1990s, and called the virus &quot;Rock Hudson&#x27;s disease&quot; and &quot;the only federally-protected virus&quot;. For a time, Dionne Warwick&#x27;s song &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Love This Way Again&quot; preceded reports about people with HIV/AIDS on his radio show. These later became &quot;condom updates,&quot; preceded by The 5th Dimension&#x27;s song &quot;Up, Up and Away&quot;. Limbaugh defended President Reagan&#x27;s response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic and falsely claimed that AIDS did not &quot;spread to the heterosexual community&quot; in the United States. When Freddie Mercury died of complications from AIDS in 1991, Limbaugh played a snippet of &quot;Another One Bites the Dust&quot;. In the early 1990s, Limbaugh ran a recurring segment, &quot;AIDS Update,&quot; which mocked the deaths of gay individuals from HIV/AIDS, and read aloud the names of the dead. During the segment, he would play songs like &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Love This Way Again&quot; and Johnny Lee&#x27;s &quot;Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places&quot;; the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that Limbaugh said, &quot;Gays deserved their fate&quot;. Limbaugh later called the segment &quot;the single most regretful thing I have ever done.&quot;

In 2013, Limbaugh commented on same-sex marriage by saying, &quot;This issue is lost. I don&#x27;t care what the Supreme Court does. This is inevitable. And it&#x27;s inevitable because we lost the language on this. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, once we started talking about gay marriage, traditional marriage, opposite-sex marriage, same-sex marriage, hetero marriage, we lost. It was over.&quot; In February 2020, Limbaugh predicted that Pete Buttigieg would not be able to win the 2020 presidential election because of his homosexuality.

===Sexual consent===
Limbaugh dismissed the concept of consent in sexual relations. He viewed consent as &quot;the magic key to the left&quot;. In 2014, Limbaugh criticized a policy at Ohio State University encouraging students to obtain verbal consent, saying &quot;How many of you guys ... have learned that &#x27;no&#x27; means &#x27;yes&#x27; if you know how to spot it?&quot; The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee used these statements to advocate a boycott of Limbaugh&#x27;s show and advertisers, asserting that the statements were tantamount to an endorsement of sexual assault. Limbaugh denied this, and his spokesman Brian Glicklick and lawyer Patricia Glaser threatened a defamation lawsuit against the DCCC. According to spokesperson Emily Bittner, the DCCC did not receive any correspondence from Limbaugh or his attorney.

===Drug policy===
Limbaugh had been an outspoken critic of what he saw as leniency towards criminal drug use in the United States. On his television show on October 5, 1995, Limbaugh stated, &quot;too many whites are getting away with drug use&quot; and illegal drug trafficking. Limbaugh proposed that the racial disparity in drug enforcement could be fixed if authorities increased detection efforts, conviction rates and jail time for whites involved in illegal drugs. He defended mandatory-minimum sentencing as an effective tool against the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s. Limbaugh accused advocates of legalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States of hypocrisy due to their advocacy of tobacco control and backlash against electronic cigarettes, and compared the advocates for its legalization in Colorado to Big Tobacco. Limbaugh&#x27;s past comments on drug users were highlighted by numerous media outlets after his own stint in a drug rehabilitation facility in 2003.

===Environmental issues===
Limbaugh was opposed to environmentalism and climate science. He rejected the relationship between CFCs and depletion of the ozone layer, claiming the scientific evidence did not support them. Limbaugh argued against the scientific consensus on climate change claiming it was &quot;just a bunch of scientists organized around a political proposition&quot; and argued that projections of climate change were the product of ideologically motivated computer simulations without the proper support of empirical data, a claim which has been widely debunked. Limbaugh used the term &quot;environmentalist wacko&quot; both when referring to left-leaning environmental advocates, and when referring to more mainstream climate scientists and other environmental scientists and advocates with whom he disagreed. Limbaugh opposed pollution credits, including a carbon cap-and-trade system, as a way to disproportionately benefit major American investment banks, particularly Goldman Sachs, and claimed that it would destroy the American national economy.

Limbaugh wrote that &quot;there are more acres of forestland in America today than when Columbus discovered the continent in 1492&quot;; however forest cover is approximately 75% of what it was in 1630.

Limbaugh strongly opposed the proposed Green New Deal and its sponsor Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

===Feminism===
Limbaugh was critical of feminism, which he viewed as advancing only liberals and not women in general. In a newspaper column he stated that it &quot;was established so that unattractive ugly broads could have easy access to the mainstream of society.&quot; He has criticized Democratic congressmen calling for more women in Congress as hypocritical due to their opposition to female Republican candidates. He has also regularly used the term &quot;feminazi&quot;, described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1994 as one of his &quot;favorite epithets for supporters of women&#x27;s rights&quot;. According to Limbaugh in 1992, for certain feminists, the &quot;most important thing in life is ensuring that as many abortions as possible occur.&quot; He also used the term referring to the half-million-large 2017 Women&#x27;s March as the &quot;Deranged Feminazi March&quot;. He credited his friend Tom Hazlett, a professor of law and economics at George Mason University, with coining the term.

===Abortion===
For two weeks in 1989, on his Sacramento radio show, Limbaugh performed &quot;caller abortions&quot; where he would end a call suddenly to the sounds of a vacuum cleaner and a scream. He would then deny that he had &quot;hung up&quot; on the caller, which he had promised not to do. Limbaugh claims that he used this gag to illustrate &quot;the tragedy of abortion&quot; as well as to highlight the question of whether abortion constitutes murder.

===Middle East===
Limbaugh was supportive of the Iraq War, and first suggested bombing Ba&#x27;athist Iraq in 2002 in revenge for the September 11 attacks. Even after no Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were found, he supported theories that they had existed. On the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal, Limbaugh said, &quot;This is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation ... And we&#x27;re going to ruin people&#x27;s lives over it and we&#x27;re going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time.&quot; Speaking at the 2009 Conservative Political Action Conference, Limbaugh accused Democratic congressional leaders such as Harry Reid of deliberately undermining the war effort.

During the 2019–21 Persian Gulf crisis, Limbaugh praised the 2020 Baghdad International Airport drone strike that resulted in the death of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps&#x27;s commander Major General Qasem Soleimani, and accused opponents of the strike of supporting Iran over the United States. On January 6, 2020, during an interview with President Donald Trump on his show, Limbaugh commended him for the strike.

===Trade===
In 1993, Limbaugh supported the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), joking in response to claims that it would lead to a transfer of unskilled labor to Mexico that this would leave the United States with only better jobs. During a 1993 televised debate against H. Ross Perot over NAFTA, Vice President Al Gore complimented Limbaugh as one of the &quot;distinguished Americans&quot; who pushed NAFTA forward in spite of the intense animosity between Limbaugh and the administration of President Bill Clinton. He later became more critical of NAFTA and trade agreements in general, claiming that they had reduced national sovereignty by &quot;subordinating&quot; America to &quot;world tribunals, like the World Trade Organization and the International Criminal Court and this kind of thing.&quot; He also claimed that promises to stem mass migration by invigorating the Latin American economy had failed. He supported a renegotiation of NAFTA and the eventual United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement.

Limbaugh defended the first Trump tariffs and the China–United States trade war as a legitimate response to predatory Chinese trade practices and its Communist command economy.

===Barack Obama conspiracy theories===

Rush Limbaugh strongly opposed Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential election, and spread false claims that Obama was a non-citizen not born in the United States. Limbaugh predicted that Obama would be unable to win the election. On January 16, 2009, Limbaugh commented on the then-upcoming Obama presidency, &quot;I hope he fails.&quot; Limbaugh later said that he wanted to see Obama&#x27;s policies fail, not the man himself. Limbaugh frequently referred to the Obama administration or presidency as regime or as the &quot;Obama regime&quot;, or even junta. Speaking of Obama, Limbaugh said, &quot;He&#x27;s my president, he&#x27;s a human being, and his ideas and policies are what count for me.&quot; Limbaugh later discouraged efforts to impeach Barack Obama as politically unrealistic.

Limbaugh accused Obama of using his race to prevent criticism of his policies, and said he was successful in his first year in office only because conservative members of the 111th Congress feared accusations of racism. Limbaugh featured a recurring skit in which his colleague James Golden, who described himself as an &quot;African-American-in-good-standing-and-certified-black-enough-to-criticize-Obama guy&quot;, appeared in a cameo as the &quot;Official EIB Obama Criticizer&quot;.

Limbaugh blamed Obama&#x27;s foreign policy, including the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq, for allowing the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Limbaugh also claimed that the 2012 Benghazi attack occurred due to a secret arms trafficking operation to the Syrian opposition authorized by Obama and coordinated by Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, speculating that the 2016 Democratic National Committee email leak would reveal evidence of it. Limbaugh also criticized the Russian reset, viewing Vladimir Putin&#x27;s rule in the Russian Federation as a thinly-veiled continuation of the Soviet Union and Marxism–Leninism. He was also critical of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, including of Obama&#x27;s decision to ratify it as an executive agreement, and claimed that it was used as a pretext for surveillance against Obama&#x27;s political opponents. Limbaugh argued that side agreements of the JCPOA limited transparency and would obligate the United States to militarily defend Iran against an Israeli offensive, including a preemptive strike to prevent nuclear weapons development.

During the West African Ebola virus epidemic, Limbaugh blamed Obama for allowing the spread of the disease to the United States in 2014, claiming that he should have stopped air travel to West Africa. He claimed that both the media and the government, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, deliberately downplayed its symptoms, expressing skepticism over the scientific consensus that the disease could be spread only through contact with bodily fluids and was not aerosol transmissible. When David Quammen criticized the idea of ending air travel to West Africa by pointing out that Liberia was founded due to slavery in the United States on &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot;, Limbaugh suggested in response that the Obama administration was deliberately allowing Ebola to be transmitted to the United States due to its guilt over slavery, stating &quot;People at the highest levels of our government say &#x27;Why, why shouldn&#x27;t we get it? Why should only those three nations in Africa get it? We&#x27;re no better than they are.&#x27; And they have this attitude, &#x27;Well, if they have it in Africa, by God, we deserve to get it, because they&#x27;re in Africa because of us and because of slavery.&#x27;&quot;

Limbaugh claimed that the 2010 eruptions of Eyjafjallajökull were God&#x27;s response to the Affordable Care Act being passed.

===Relationship with Donald Trump===

Limbaugh was consistently supportive of the candidacy and first presidency of Donald Trump, although he endorsed Ted Cruz during the 2016 Republican Party presidential primaries and took issue with Trump&#x27;s treatment of Cruz. Limbaugh later criticized Cruz&#x27;s hesitance to endorse Trump after his nomination at the 2016 Republican National Convention, comparing it to Ted Kennedy&#x27;s lukewarm support of Jimmy Carter at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. After the election he became supportive of deep-state conspiracy theories, claiming that the United States had entered a &quot;Cold Civil War&quot; in which the Democratic Party was attempting to illegitimately overturn the election results and that it was part of a trend of Democrats contesting elections beginning with the 2000 Florida election recount intended to eventually eliminate free elections in the United States.

In December 2018, Limbaugh criticized Trump for preparing to accept a continuing resolution that would fund the government through February 8, 2019, but included no funding for a border wall on the Mexico–United States border, a campaign promise repeatedly emphasized by Trump. Trump would subsequently make a surprise telephone call to Limbaugh announcing his intent to veto the bill, a decision that would lead to the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown. Limbaugh would go on to support the shutdown, stating, &quot;We have a president keeping promises left and right. And isn&#x27;t it interesting to see how trivial Washington thinks that is?&quot; After Trump declared the National Emergency Concerning the Southern Border of the United States and the 116th Congress failed in its attempt to override it, Limbaugh called on him to completely close the border with Mexico.

Limbaugh was dismissive of controversies over myriad&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage_Goldman_5/17/2023&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; suspicious links between Trump associates and Russian officials and spies. He claimed that the FBI investigations of Michael Flynn and Paul Manafort, as well as the subsequent Special Counsel investigation directed by Robert Mueller, were orchestrated by Barack Obama and the Democratic Party to undermine the legitimacy of Trump&#x27;s presidency, constituting an illegal coup d&#x27;état. Limbaugh claimed that George Papadopoulos was entrapped by the FBI, which he claimed Joseph Mifsud was an informant for, through Stefan Halper as part of an &quot;insurance policy&quot; against Trump&#x27;s election by the Five Eyes intelligence alliance. Limbaugh advocated a full presidential pardon for all suspects indicted or convicted by the investigation. After the release of the Mueller report, he disputed its conclusion that WikiLeaks obtained the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s emails from the Russian government and its depiction of Donald Trump Jr.&#x27;s Trump Tower meeting. He claimed that allegations of obstruction of justice were leveled at Trump due to the Report&#x27;s conclusion that Trump did not directly collude with Russian officials, and that Trump&#x27;s intent to fire Mueller and Attorney General Jeff Sessions was legitimate.

Limbaugh supported the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity as well as Trump&#x27;s claims that he lost the popular vote due to voter impersonation by illegal immigrants.

After the House of Representatives commenced a formal impeachment inquiry against President Trump due to the scandal over a 2019 telephone call to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy, pressuring the Ukrainian government to prosecute 2020 Democratic primary candidate Joe Biden shortly after a freeze of military aid, Limbaugh argued that the two events were unrelated since Trump had made a decision to withhold military funds a month in advance. He additionally claimed that Trump&#x27;s desire for the Ukrainian government to prosecute Biden was legally justified by a 1999 mutual legal assistance treaty with Ukraine and &quot;was following the law to the letter when it comes to unearthing the long-standing corruption that has swirled in Ukraine and allegedly involves powerful Democrats like Joe Biden.&quot;

===Alleging false flag attacks===

Limbaugh claimed that the October 2018 United States mail bombing attempts were perpetuated as a false flag operation to draw public attention away from Central American migrant caravans. He reiterated these claims two weeks after the arrest of the primary suspect Cesar Sayoc, a registered Republican.

On his show, Limbaugh said that the Christchurch mosque shootings of March 2019 may have been a false-flag operation. Limbaugh described &quot;an ongoing theory&quot; that the shooter was actually &quot;a leftist&quot; trying to smear the right. Despite providing no source or evidence, Limbaugh continued: &quot;you can&#x27;t immediately discount this. The left is this insane, they are this crazy.&quot;

==Controversies and inaccuracies==
Comedian Al Franken, who later became a Senator, wrote a satirical 1996 book, &quot;Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations&quot;, in which he accused Limbaugh of distorting facts to serve his own political biases.

Of Limbaugh&#x27;s controversial statements and allegations they have investigated, &quot;Politifact&quot; has rated 84% as ranging from &quot;Mostly False&quot; to &quot;Pants On Fire&quot; (signifying false statements that cannot be reasonably assessed as merely errors), with 5% of Limbaugh&#x27;s contested statements rising to the level of &quot;Mostly True&quot; and 0% rated &quot;True&quot;. These debunked allegations by Limbaugh include suggestions that the existence of gorillas disproves the theory of evolution, that Ted Kennedy sent a letter to Soviet General Secretary Yuri Andropov seeking to undercut President Reagan, that a recent lack of hurricanes disproves climate change, and that President Obama wanted to mandate circumcision.

=== Hu Jintao ===
Limbaugh was heavily criticized for mocking Hu Jintao, then the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party and paramount leader of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and the Chinese language during an episode. After proceeding to label Hu as a &quot;Chicom dictator&quot;, Limbaugh mocked the Chinese language, primarily using words like ching chong.

=== Joseph Kony ===
On October 14, 2011, Limbaugh questioned the U.S. Armed Forces initiative against Joseph Kony and his Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army (LRA), based on the assumption that they were Christians. &quot;They are fighting the Muslims in Sudan. And Obama has sent troops, United States troops to remove them from the battlefield, which means kill them.&quot; Upon learning about the accusations leveled against Kony, which included kidnapping whole schools of young children for use as child soldiers, Limbaugh stated that he would research the group.

=== &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; ===
In 2010, after the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Limbaugh speculated on his show that eco-terrorists deliberately destroyed the oil well to justify President Obama&#x27;s deepwater drilling moratorium.

=== Unite the Right ===
After the white supremacist Unite the Right rally, in which a counter-protester was murdered in the Charlottesville car attack, Limbaugh claimed that the violence had been provoked by Black Lives Matter activists, Antifa, and Robert Creamer. He also claimed without evidence that the police response had been deliberately restrained by Terry McAuliffe as a botched attempt to start a presidential bid in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, and that it was part of a campaign by &quot;international financiers&quot; such as George Soros to start a Second American Civil War to remove its status as a global superpower.

===Chelsea Clinton===
During the Clinton administration, while taping his television program, Limbaugh referred to media coverage of Socks, the Clintons&#x27; cat. He then stated, &quot;But did you know there is also a White House dog?&quot; and presented a picture of Chelsea Clinton who was 13 years old at the time.

===Michael J. Fox===
In October 2006, Limbaugh said Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson&#x27;s disease, had exaggerated the effects of his disability in a political TV advertisement advocating for funding of stem cell research. Limbaugh said that Fox in the ad had been &quot;shameless&quot; in &quot;moving all around and shaking&quot;, and that Fox had not taken &quot;his medication or he&#x27;s acting, one of the two&quot;. Fox said &quot;the irony of it is I was too medicated&quot;, adding that there was no way to predict how his symptoms would manifest. Limbaugh said he would apologize to Fox &quot;bigly, hugely... if I am wrong in characterizing his behavior on this commercial as an act.&quot; In 2012, Fox said Limbaugh in 2006 had acted on &quot;bullying instincts&quot; when &quot;he said I faked it. I didn&#x27;t fake it.&quot;, and said Limbaugh&#x27;s goal was to have him marginalized and shut down for his stem cell stance.

===Phony soldiers===
In 2007, Media Matters reported that Limbaugh had categorized Iraq War veterans opposed to the war as &quot;the phony soldiers&quot;. Limbaugh later said that he was speaking of Jesse MacBeth, a soldier who falsely claimed to have been decorated for valor but, in fact, had never seen combat. Limbaugh said Media Matters was trying to smear him with out-of-context and selectively edited comments. After Limbaugh published what he claimed was the entire transcript of phony soldiers discussion, Media Matters said that over a minute and 30 seconds of the transcript was omitted without &quot;notation or ellipsis to indicate that there is, in fact, a break in the transcript.&quot; Limbaugh said during the minute and a half gap Media Matters had pointed out, he was waiting for relevant ABC News copy on the topic, and the transcript and audio edits were &quot;for space and relevance reasons, not to hide anything.&quot; Senator Harry Reid and 41 Democrats, including Hillary Clinton, signed a letter asking the CEO of Clear Channel to denounce Limbaugh. Instead, the executive gave the letter to Limbaugh to auction. It raised $2.1 million, at the time an eBay record for an auction item for charity. Limbaugh said he would match the donation and give it to the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation.

===Bid for ownership of the Rams===
The NFL team moved to St. Louis, Missouri, and Limbaugh wanted to be a partial owner, but in October 2009, the group that planned to buy the Rams, dropped him. Limbaugh blamed Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, among others, for his bid failure.

===Sandra Fluke===

On February 29, 2012, Limbaugh, while talking about contraceptive mandates, included remarks about law student Sandra Fluke as a &quot;slut&quot; and &quot;prostitute&quot;. Limbaugh was commenting on Fluke&#x27;s speech the previous week to House Democrats in support of mandating insurance coverage for contraceptives. Limbaugh made numerous similar statements over the next two days, leading to the loss of 45 to &quot;more than 100&quot; local and national sponsors and Limbaugh&#x27;s apology on his show for some of his comments. Susan MacMillan Emry co-organized a public relations campaign called Rock the Slut Vote as a response to Limbaugh&#x27;s remarks.

===COVID-19 pandemic in the United States===

During the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, Limbaugh asserted that the virus was the common cold. Limbaugh said on his radio show on February 24, 2020, &quot;I&#x27;m dead right on this. The coronavirus is the common cold, folks,&quot; alleging it was being &quot;weaponized&quot; to bring down Trump. Limbaugh&#x27;s statement was called &quot;wildly irresponsible&quot; by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

==Charitable work==
===Leukemia and lymphoma telethon===
From 1990 until his death, Limbaugh held an annual fundraising telethon called the &quot;EIB Cure-a-Thon&quot; for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. In 2006, the EIB Cure-a-Thon conducted its 16th annual telethon, raising $1.7 million, totaling over $15 million since the first cure-a-thon. According to Leukemia and Lymphoma Society annual reports, Limbaugh personally contributed between $100,000 and $499,999 from 2000 to 2005 and in 2007, and Limbaugh said that he contributed around $250,000 in 2003, 2004, and 2005. The Society&#x27;s 2006 annual report placed him in the $500,000 to $999,999 category. Limbaugh donated $320,000 during the 2007 Cure-a-Thon, which the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society reported had raised $3.1 million. On his radio program April 18, 2008, Limbaugh pledged $400,000 to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society after being challenged by two listeners to increase his initial pledge of $300,000.

===Marine Corps–Law Enforcement Foundation===
Limbaugh conducted an annual drive to help the Marine Corps–Law Enforcement Foundation collect contributions to provide scholarships for children of Marines and law enforcement officers and agents who have died in the line of duty. The foundation was the beneficiary of a record $2.1 million eBay auction in October 2007 after Limbaugh listed for sale a letter critical of him signed by 41 Democratic senators; he pledged to match the selling price.
With the founding of his and his wife&#x27;s company Two if by Tea, they pledged to donate at least $100,000 to the MC–LEF beginning in June 2011.

===Tunnel to Towers Foundation===

In July 2019, Nike announced a special Fourth of July edition of their Air Max1 Quick Strike sneaker that featured the thirteen-star Betsy Ross flag. The company withdrew the sneaker after their spokesman Colin Kaepernick raised concerns that the symbol represented an era of black enslavement. In response Limbaugh&#x27;s radio program introduced a t-shirt imprinted &quot;Stand up for Betsy Ross&quot; with sale proceeds to benefit the Tunnel to Towers Foundation. , the sales have earned over US$5 million for the foundation.

==Published works==
In 1992, Limbaugh published his first book, &quot;The Way Things Ought to Be&quot;, followed by &quot;See, I Told You So&quot;, the following year. Both titles were number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for 24 weeks. His first book was dictated by himself, and transcribed and edited by &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; writer John Fund.

In 2013, Limbaugh authored his first children&#x27;s book, entitled &quot;Rush Revere and the Brave Pilgrims: Time-Travel with Exceptional Americans&quot;. He received the Author of the Year Award from the Children&#x27;s Book Council for this work. Limbaugh&#x27;s second children&#x27;s book was released the following year, entitled &quot;Rush Revere and the First Patriots: Time-Travel with Exceptional Americans&quot;. This book was nominated as an author-of-the year finalist for the annual Children&#x27;s and Teen Choice Book Awards. Limbaugh&#x27;s third children&#x27;s book was released later this same year, written with his wife Kathryn and entitled &quot;Rush Revere and the American Revolution&quot;. The Limbaughs dedicated this to the U.S. military and their families.

==Personal life==
Limbaugh was raised and considered himself a Methodist.

He was married four times and divorced three times. He did not have any children. He was first married at the age of 26 to Roxy Maxine McNeely, a sales secretary at radio station WHB in Kansas City, Missouri. The couple married at the Centenary United Methodist Church in Limbaugh&#x27;s hometown of Cape Girardeau on September 24, 1977. McNeely filed for divorce in March 1980, citing &quot;incompatibility&quot;. They were formally divorced on July 10, 1980. 

In 1983, Limbaugh married Michelle Sixta, a college student and usherette at the Kansas City Royals Stadium Club. They divorced in 1990, and she remarried the following year.

On May 27, 1994, Limbaugh married Marta Fitzgerald, a 35-year-old aerobics instructor whom he met on the online service CompuServe in 1990. They married at the house of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, who officiated. The couple separated on June 11, 2004. Limbaugh announced his divorce on the air. It was finalized in December 2004. In September 2004, Limbaugh became romantically involved with then-CNN news anchor Daryn Kagan; the relationship ended in February 2006.

Limbaugh lived in Palm Beach from 1996 until his death in 2021. A friend recalls that Limbaugh &quot;fell in love with Palm Beach... after visiting her over Memorial Day weekend in 1995.&quot; Unlike New York, Florida does not tax income, the stated reason Limbaugh moved his residence and established his &quot;Southern Command&quot;.

He dated Kathryn Rogers, a party planner from Florida, for three years; the couple married on June 5, 2010. At the wedding reception following the ceremony, Elton John entertained the wedding guests for a reported $1 million fee; however, Limbaugh himself denied that the $1 million figure was accurate on his September 7, 2010, radio show.

Through a holding company, KARHL Holdings (KARHL meaning &quot;Kathryn and Rush Hudson Limbaugh&quot;), Limbaugh launched a line of bottled iced tea beverages in 2011. The brand name &quot;Two if by Tea&quot; was a play on the line from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s Ride&quot;, &quot;one if by land, two if by sea&quot;. Production of the tea was put on hold in 2018 with a statement that &quot;Due to rising manufacturing and shipping costs, we did not feel it was right to pass this on to our customers.&quot;.

===Prescription drug addiction===
On October 3, 2003, the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; reported that Limbaugh was being investigated for illegally obtaining the prescription drugs oxycodone and hydrocodone. Other news outlets quickly confirmed the investigation. He admitted to listeners on his radio show on October 10, 2003, that he was addicted to prescription painkillers and stated that he would enter inpatient treatment for 30 days, immediately after the broadcast. Limbaugh stated his addiction to painkillers resulted from several years of severe back pain heightened by a botched surgery intended to correct those problems.

A subsequent investigation into whether Limbaugh had violated Florida&#x27;s doctor shopping laws was launched by the Palm Beach State Attorney, which raised privacy issues when investigators seized Limbaugh&#x27;s private medical records looking for evidence of crimes. Roy Black, one of Limbaugh&#x27;s attorneys, stated that &quot;Rush Limbaugh was singled out for prosecution because of who he is. We believe the state attorney&#x27;s office is applying a double standard.&quot; On November 9, 2005, following two years of investigations, Assistant State Attorney James L. Martz requested that the court set aside Limbaugh&#x27;s doctor–patient confidentiality rights and allow the state to question his physicians. Limbaugh&#x27;s attorney opposed the prosecutor&#x27;s efforts to interview his doctors on the basis of patient privacy rights, and argued that the prosecutor had violated Limbaugh&#x27;s Fourth Amendment rights by illegally seizing his medical records. The American Civil Liberties Union issued a statement in agreement and filed an amicus curiae brief in support of Limbaugh. On December 12, 2005, Judge David F. Crow delivered a ruling prohibiting the State of Florida from questioning Limbaugh&#x27;s physicians about &quot;the medical condition of the patient and any information disclosed to the health care practitioner by the patient in the course of the care and treatment of the patient.&quot;

On April 28, 2006, a warrant was issued for his arrest on the charge of doctor shopping. According to Teri Barbera, spokeswoman for the sheriff, during his arrest, Limbaugh was booked, photographed, and fingerprinted, but not handcuffed. He was then released after about an hour on $3,000 bail. After his surrender, he filed a &quot;not guilty&quot; plea to the charge. Prosecutors explained that the charges were brought after they discovered he received about 2,000 painkillers, prescribed by four doctors in six months, at a pharmacy near his Palm Beach mansion. In 2009, after three years of prolonged discussion regarding a settlement, prosecutors agreed to drop the charge if Limbaugh paid $30,000 to defray the cost of the investigation, completed an 18-month therapy regimen with his physician, submitted to random drug testing, and gave up his right to own a firearm for eighteen months. Limbaugh agreed to the settlement, though he continued to maintain his innocence of doctor shopping and asserted that the state&#x27;s offer resulted from a lack of evidence supporting the charge.

Before his addiction became known, Limbaugh had condemned illegal drug use on his television program, stating that &quot;Drug use, some might say, is destroying this country... And so if people are violating the law by doing drugs, they ought to be accused and they ought to be convicted and they ought to be sent up.&quot;

===Viagra incident===
In June 2006, Limbaugh was detained by drug enforcement agents at Palm Beach International Airport. Customs officials confiscated Viagra from Limbaugh&#x27;s luggage as he was returning from the Dominican Republic. The prescription was not in Limbaugh&#x27;s name. After he was released with no charges filed, Limbaugh joked about the incident on his radio show, claiming that he got the Viagra at the Clinton Library and was told they were blue M&amp;M&#x27;s. He also stated that &quot;I had a great time in the Dominican Republic. Wish I could tell you about it.&quot;

===Health problems and death===
Limbaugh described himself as being &quot;100 percent, totally deaf&quot;. In 2001, he announced that he had lost most of his ability to hear: &quot;I cannot hear television. I cannot hear music. I am, for all practical purposes, deaf and it&#x27;s happened in three months.&quot; He said that the condition was not genetic. On December 19, 2001, doctors at the House Ear Clinic in Los Angeles were able to successfully restore a measure of his hearing through cochlear implant surgery. Limbaugh received a Clarion CII Bionic Ear.

When questioned whether Limbaugh&#x27;s sudden hearing loss was caused by his addiction to opioids, his cochlear implant doctor, otolaryngologist Jennifer Derebery, said that it was possible, but that there is no way to know for sure without performing tests that would destroy Limbaugh&#x27;s hearing completely. &quot;We don&#x27;t know why some people, but apparently not most, who take large doses may lose their hearing.&quot;

In 2005, Limbaugh was forced to undergo &quot;tuning&quot; due to an &quot;eye twitch&quot;, an apparent side-effect of cochlear implants.

On December 30, 2009, while vacationing in Honolulu, Hawaii, Limbaugh was admitted to Queen&#x27;s Medical Center with intense chest pains. His doctors attributed the pain to angina pectoris.

On April 8, 2014, on his radio program, Limbaugh announced his decision to &#x27;go bilateral&#x27;. &quot;I&#x27;m going to get an implant on the right side&quot;, he said. After bilateral tuning, there was a 100% improvement. &quot;Coming from total deafness, it is miraculous! How can you not believe in God?&quot;, Limbaugh said in his national daily broadcast.

Limbaugh, a cigar and former cigarette smoker, was diagnosed with advanced lung cancer on January 20, 2020, after first experiencing shortness of breath on January 12. He had previously downplayed the link between smoking and cancer deaths, arguing that it &quot;takes 50 years to kill people, if it does.&quot; He announced his diagnosis during his radio show on February 3. He advised he would miss airtime to undergo treatment, and that he would try to continue the program &quot;as normally and competently&quot; as he could. On October 20, 2020, Limbaugh announced that treatment had been ineffectual at containing the cancer, that his diagnosis was terminal, and that he had been given a time frame on when he should expect to die. In his final broadcast of 2020, he said &quot;I wasn&#x27;t expected to make it to October, and then to November, and then to December. And yet, here I am, and today, got some problems, but I&#x27;m feeling pretty good today.&quot;

Limbaugh made his last radio broadcast on February 2, 2021. He died on February 17, at the age of 70. According to his wife, Kathryn Rogers Limbaugh, his death was attributed to complications of his lung cancer. Governor Ron DeSantis directed flags in the state of Florida be lowered to half-staff on the date of his interment. Limbaugh was interred at the Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis, Missouri.

== Influence and legacy ==

Limbaugh was widely recognized as one of the leading voices of the conservative movement in the United States, beginning in the 1990s. Former president Ronald Reagan thanked him in a 1992 letter, giving him credit &quot;for all you&#x27;re doing to promote Republican and conservative principles... [and] you have become the Number One voice for conservatism in our Country.&quot; In 1994, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives made Limbaugh an honorary member.

From 1994, Limbaugh served as the inspiration for the character of Birch Barlow, a conservative radio talk show host on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.

In 1995, Limbaugh was profiled on the PBS series &quot;Frontline&quot; in a one-hour documentary called &quot;Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s America&quot;. Limbaugh refused to be interviewed, but his mother, brother, and many Republican supporters took part, as well as critics and opponents.

By the 1990s, Limbaugh had become known for his love of cigars, saying, &quot;I think cigars are just a tremendous addition to the enjoyment of life.&quot; During his syndicated television program from 1992 to 1996, he also became known for wearing distinctive neckties. In response to viewer interest, Limbaugh launched a series of ties designed primarily by his then-wife Marta.

Limbaugh was awarded the Marconi Radio Award for Syndicated Radio Personality of the Year by the National Association of Broadcasters five times: 1992, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2014. He was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1993 and the National Association of Broadcasters Hall of Fame in 1998. By 2001, he inked a  million contract for eight years, which was renewed in 2008 for another eight years at $400 million. By 2017, Limbaugh was the second-highest-paid radio host in the United States, earning an annual salary of $84 million, second only to Howard Stern. In 2002, &quot;Talkers Magazine&quot; ranked him as the greatest-ever radio talk show host; in 2017, he was the most-listened-to radio host in the United States, with 14 million listeners. Limbaugh is given much of the credit for having revived AM radio at a time when most people had switched to FM.

Conservative magazine &quot;Human Events&quot; announced Limbaugh as their 2007 Man of the Year. Later that same year, Barbara Walters featured Limbaugh as one of the most fascinating people of the year in a special that aired on December 4, 2008.

On February 28, 2009, following his self-described &quot;first address to the nation&quot; lasting 90 minutes, carried live on CNN and Fox News and recorded for C-SPAN, Limbaugh received CPAC&#x27;s &quot;Defender of the Constitution Award&quot;, a document signed by Benjamin Franklin, given to someone &quot;who has stood up for the First Amendment ... Rush Limbaugh is for America, exactly what Benjamin Franklin did for the Founding Fathers ... the only way we will be successful is if we listen to Rush Limbaugh&quot;, reads the citation.

In his 2010 book, &quot;Rush Limbaugh: An Army of One&quot;, Ze&#x27;ev Chafets cited Limbaugh as &quot;the brains and the spirit behind&quot; the Republican Party&#x27;s resurgence in the 2010 midterm elections in the wake of the election of President Obama. Chafets pointed, among others, to Sen. Arlen Specter&#x27;s defeat, after being labeled by Limbaugh as a &quot;Republican in Name Only&quot;, and to Sarah Palin, whose &quot;biggest current applause line Republicans are not just the party of no, but the party of hell no came courtesy of Mr. Limbaugh.&quot; The author continued with ...&quot;Limbaugh has argued the &#x27;party-of-no&#x27; conservative course for the Republicans vigorously, notably since six weeks after Obama&#x27;s inauguration, and has been fundamental to, and encouraging to, the more prominently noted Tea Party movement&quot;.

Rush Limbaugh was inducted into the Hall of Famous Missourians on May 14, 2012, in a secret ceremony announced only 20 minutes before it began in order to prevent negative media attention. A bronze bust of Limbaugh is on display at the Missouri State Capitol building in Jefferson City, along with 40 other awardees. Limbaugh&#x27;s bust includes a security camera to prevent vandalism.

On February 4, 2020, the day after he announced that he had advanced lung cancer, Limbaugh was a guest of President Donald Trump at the 2020 State of the Union Address, where he was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Melania Trump.

<doc id="25428" wikidata="Q51552" url="?curid=25428" title="Roman Polanski">
<text>Raymond Roman Thierry Polański (; born 18 August 1933) is a French and Polish film director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. He is the recipient of numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, three British Academy Film Awards, ten César Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, as well as the Golden Bear and a Palme d&#x27;Or.

In 1977, Polanski was arrested for drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl. He pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of unlawful sex with a minor in exchange for a probation-only sentence. The night before his sentencing hearing in 1978, he learned that the judge would likely reject the proffered plea bargain, so he fled the U.S. to Europe, where he continued his career. He remains a fugitive from the U.S. justice system. Further allegations of abuse have been made by other women.

Polanski&#x27;s Polish Jewish parents moved the family from his birthplace in Paris back to Kraków in 1937. Two years later, the invasion of Poland by Nazi Germany started World War II, and the family found themselves trapped in the Kraków Ghetto. After his mother and father were taken in raids, Polanski spent his formative years in foster homes, surviving the Holocaust by adopting a false identity and concealing his Jewish heritage. In 1969, Polanski&#x27;s pregnant wife, actress Sharon Tate, was murdered, along with four friends by members of the Manson Family in an internationally notorious case.

Polanski&#x27;s first feature-length film, &quot;Knife in the Water&quot; (1962), made in Poland, was nominated for the United States Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. After living in France for a few years, he moved to the United Kingdom, where he directed his first three English-language feature-length films: &quot;Repulsion&quot; (1965), &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot; (1966), and &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; (1967). In 1968, he moved to the United States and cemented his status in the film industry by directing the horror film &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968). He made &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1971) in England and &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974) back in Hollywood. His other critically acclaimed films include &quot;The Tenant&quot; (1976), &quot;Tess&quot; (1979), &quot;The Pianist&quot; (2002) which won him the Academy Award for Best Director, &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot; (2010), &quot;Venus in Fur&quot; (2013), and &quot;An Officer and a Spy&quot; (2019). Polanski has made 23 feature films to date.

== Early life ==
Roman Polanski was born on 18 August 1933, in interbellum Paris. He was the son of Bula (aka &quot;Bella&quot;) Katz-Przedborska and Mojżesz (or Maurycy) Liebling (later Polański), a painter and manufacturer of sculptures, who after World War II was known as Ryszard Polański. Polanski&#x27;s father was Jewish and originally from Poland. Polanski&#x27;s mother was born in Russia. Her own father was Jewish and mother was a Gentile, but Bula had been raised in the Catholic faith. She had a daughter, Annette, by her previous husband. Annette survived Auschwitz, where her mother was murdered, and left Poland forever for France. Polanski&#x27;s parents were both agnostics. Polanski later stated that he was an atheist.

=== World War II and the Holocaust ===
The Polański family moved back to Kraków, Poland, in early 1937, and were living there when World War II began with the invasion of Poland. Kraków was soon occupied by the German forces, and the racist and anti-Semitic Nuremberg Laws made the Polańskis targets of persecution, forcing them into the Kraków Ghetto, along with thousands of the city&#x27;s Jews. Around the age of six, Polanski attended primary school for only a few weeks, until &quot;all the Jewish children were abruptly expelled&quot;, writes biographer Christopher Sandford. That initiative was soon followed by the requirement that all Jewish children over the age of twelve wear white armbands, with a blue Star of David imprinted, for visual identification. After he was expelled, Polanski would not be allowed to enter another classroom for six years.

Polanski&#x27;s father was transferred, along with thousands of other Jews, to Mauthausen, a group of 49 German concentration camps in Austria. His mother, who was four months pregnant at the time, was taken to Auschwitz and killed in the gas chamber soon after arriving. The forced exodus took place immediately after the German liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto, a real-life backdrop to Polanski&#x27;s film &quot;The Pianist&quot; (2002). Polanski, who was then hiding from the Germans, saw his father being marched off with a long line of people. Polanski tried getting closer to his father to ask him what was happening and got within a few yards. His father saw him, but afraid his son might be spotted by the German soldiers, whispered (in Polish), &quot;Get lost!&quot;

Polanski escaped the Kraków Ghetto in 1943 and survived with the help of some Polish Roman Catholics, including a woman who had promised Polanski&#x27;s father that she would shelter the boy. Polanski attended church, learned to recite Catholic prayers by heart, and behaved outwardly as a Roman Catholic, although he was never baptized. His efforts to blend into a Catholic household failed miserably at least once, when the parish priest visiting the family posed questions to him one-on-one about the catechism, and ultimately said, &quot;You aren&#x27;t one of us&quot;. The punishment for helping a Jew in German-occupied Poland was death.

As Polanski roamed the countryside trying to survive in a Poland now occupied by German troops, he witnessed many horrors, such as being &quot;forced to take part in a cruel and sadistic game in which German soldiers took shots at him for target practice&quot;. The author Ian Freer concludes that Polanski&#x27;s constant childhood fears and dread of violence have contributed to the &quot;tangible atmospheres he conjures up on film&quot;. By the time the war ended in 1945, a fifth of the Polish population had been killed, the vast majority being civilians. Of those deaths, 3 million were Polish Jews, which accounted for 90% of the country&#x27;s Jewish population. According to Sandford, Polanski would use the memory of his mother, her dress and makeup style, as a physical model for Faye Dunaway&#x27;s character in his film &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974).

In October 2020, Polanski went back to Poland and paid respects to a Polish couple who helped him hide and escape the Nazis. Stefania and Jan Buchala were recognized by Yad Vashem, Israel&#x27;s Holocaust memorial, as &quot;Righteous Among the Nations&quot;. Polanski recalled Stefania Buchala as being an &quot;extremely noble&quot; and courageous person.

=== After the war ===
After the war, Polanski was reunited with his father and moved back to Kraków. His father remarried on 21 December 1946 to Wanda Zajączkowska (whom Polanski had never liked) and died of cancer in 1984. Time repaired the family contacts; Polanski visited them in Kraków, and relatives visited him in Hollywood and Paris. Polanski recalls the villages and families he lived with as relatively primitive by European standards:
Polanski stated that &quot;you must live in a Communist country to really understand how bad it can be. Then you will appreciate capitalism.&quot; He also remembered events at the war&#x27;s end and his reintroduction to mainstream society when he was 12, forming friendships with other children, such as Roma Ligocka, Ryszard Horowitz and his family.

=== Introduction to movies ===
Polanski&#x27;s fascination with cinema began very early when he was around age four or five. He recalls this period in an interview:
After the war, Polanski watched films, either at school or at a local cinema, using whatever pocket money he had. Polanski writes, &quot;Most of this went on the movies, but movie seats were dirt cheap, so a little went a long way. I lapped up every kind of film.&quot; As time went on, movies became more than an escape into entertainment, as he explains:
Polanski was above all influenced by Carol Reed&#x27;s &quot;Odd Man Out&quot; (1947) – &quot;I still consider it as one of the best movies I&#x27;ve ever seen and a film which made me want to pursue this career more than anything else ... I always dreamt of doing things of this sort or that style. To a certain extent I must say that I somehow perpetuate the ideas of that movie in what I do.&quot;

== Early career in Poland ==

Polanski attended the National Film School in Łódź, the third-largest city in Poland. In the 1950s, Polanski took up acting, appearing in Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s &quot;Pokolenie&quot; (&quot;A Generation&quot;, 1954) and in the same year in Silik Sternfeld&#x27;s &quot;Zaczarowany rower&quot; (&quot;Enchanted Bicycle&quot; or &quot;Magical Bicycle&quot;). Polanski&#x27;s directorial debut was also in 1955 with a short film, &quot;Rower&quot; (&quot;Bicycle&quot;). &quot;Rower&quot; is a semi-autobiographical feature film, believed to be lost, which also starred Polanski. It refers to his real-life violent altercation with a notorious Kraków felon, Janusz Dziuba, who arranged to sell Polanski a bicycle, but instead beat him badly and stole his money. In real life, the offender was arrested while fleeing after fracturing Polanski&#x27;s skull, and executed for three murders, out of eight prior such assaults which he had committed. Several other short films made during his study at Łódź gained him considerable recognition, particularly &quot;Two Men and a Wardrobe&quot; (1958) and &quot;When Angels Fall&quot; (1959). He graduated in 1959.

== Film director ==

=== 1962–1976: Breakthrough and stardom ===
 &quot;Knife in the Water&quot; (1962)
Polanski&#x27;s first feature-length film, &quot;Knife in the Water&quot;, was also one of the first significant Polish films after the Second World War that did not have a war theme. Scripted by Jerzy Skolimowski, Jakub Goldberg, and Polanski, &quot;Knife in the Water&quot; is about a wealthy, unhappily married couple who decide to take a mysterious hitchhiker with them on a weekend boating excursion. &quot;Knife in the Water&quot; was a major commercial success in the West and gave Polanski an international reputation. The film also earned its director his first Academy Award nomination (Best Foreign Language Film) in 1963. Leon Niemczyk, who played Andrzej, was the only professional actor in the film. Jolanta Umecka, who played Krystyna, was discovered by Polanski at a swimming pool.

Polanski left then-communist Poland and moved to France, where he had already made two notable short films in 1961: &quot;The Fat and the Lean&quot; and &quot;Mammals&quot;. While in France, Polanski contributed one segment (&quot;La rivière de diamants&quot;) to the French-produced omnibus film, &quot;Les plus belles escroqueries du monde&quot; (English title: &quot;The Beautiful Swindlers&quot;) in 1964. (He has since had the segment removed from all releases of the film.) However, Polanski found that in the early 1960s, the French film industry was xenophobic and generally unwilling to support a rising filmmaker of foreign origin.

 &quot;Repulsion&quot; (1965)
Polanski made three feature films in England, based on original scripts written by himself and Gérard Brach, a frequent collaborator. &quot;Repulsion&quot; (1965) is a psychological horror film focusing on a young Belgian woman named Carol (Catherine Deneuve).

The film&#x27;s themes, situations, visual motifs, and effects clearly reflect the influence of early surrealist cinema as well as horror movies of the 1950s—particularly Luis Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;Un chien Andalou&quot;, Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;The Blood of a Poet&quot;, Henri-Georges Clouzot&#x27;s &quot;Diabolique&quot; and Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot;.

 &quot;Cul-de-sac&quot; (1966)
&quot;Cul-de-sac&quot; (1966) is a bleak nihilist tragicomedy filmed on location in Northumberland. The tone and premise of the film owe a great deal to Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, along with aspects of Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Birthday Party&quot;.

In 1966 Polanski co-produced the short film &quot;G.G. Passion&quot;, directed by David Bailey.

 &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers/Dance of the Vampires&quot; (1967)

&quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; (1967) (known by its original title, &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot; in most countries outside the United States) is a parody of vampire films. The plot concerns a buffoonish professor and his clumsy assistant, Alfred (played by Polanski), who are traveling through Transylvania in search of vampires. &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; was Polanski&#x27;s first feature to be photographed in color with the use of Panavision lenses, and included a striking visual style with snow-covered, fairy-tale landscapes, similar to the work of Soviet fantasy filmmakers. In addition, the richly textured color schemes of the settings evoke the paintings of the Belarusian-Jewish artist Marc Chagall, who provides the namesake for the innkeeper in the film. The film was written for Jack MacGowran, who played the lead role of Professor Abronsius.

Polanski met Sharon Tate while making the film; she played the role of the local innkeeper&#x27;s daughter. They were married in London on 1968. Shortly after they married, Polanski, with Tate at his side during a documentary film, described the demands of young movie viewers who he said always wanted to see something &quot;new&quot; and &quot;different&quot;.

 &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968)
Paramount studio head Robert Evans brought Polanski to America ostensibly to direct the film &quot;Downhill Racer&quot;, but told Polanski that he really wanted him to read the horror novel &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; by Ira Levin to see if a film could be made out of it. Polanski read it non-stop through the night and the following morning decided he wanted to write as well as direct it. He wrote the 272-page screenplay in just over three weeks. The film, &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot; (1968), was a box-office success and became his first Hollywood production, thereby establishing his reputation as a major commercial filmmaker. The film, a horror-thriller set in trendy Manhattan, is about Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow), a young housewife who is impregnated by the devil. Polanski&#x27;s screenplay adaptation earned him a second Academy Award nomination.

On 9 August 1969, while Polanski was working in London, his pregnant wife, Sharon Tate, and four other people were murdered at the Polanskis&#x27; residence in Los Angeles by cult leader Charles Manson&#x27;s followers.

 &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1971)
Polanski adapted &quot;Macbeth&quot; into a screenplay with the Shakespeare expert Kenneth Tynan. Jon Finch and Francesca Annis played the main characters. Hugh Hefner and Playboy Productions funded the 1971 film, which opened in New York and was screened in Playboy Theater. Hefner was credited as executive producer, and the film was listed as a &quot;Playboy Production&quot;. It was controversial because of Lady Macbeth&#x27;s being nude in a scene, and received an X rating because of its graphic violence and nudity. In his autobiography, Polanski wrote that he wanted to be true to the violent nature of the work and that he had been aware that his first project following Tate&#x27;s murder would be subject to scrutiny and probable criticism regardless of the subject matter; if he had made a comedy he would have been perceived as callous.

 &quot;What?&quot; (1972)
Written by Polanski and previous collaborator Gérard Brach, &quot;What?&quot; (1972) is a mordant absurdist comedy loosely based on the themes of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; and Henry James. The film is a rambling shaggy dog story about the sexual indignities that befall a winsome young American hippie woman hitchhiking through Europe.

 &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974)

Polanski returned to Hollywood in 1973 to direct &quot;Chinatown&quot; (1974) for Paramount Pictures. The film is widely considered to be one of the finest American mystery crime movies, inspired by the real-life California Water Wars, a series of disputes over southern California water at the beginning of the 20th century.

It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including those for actors Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway. Robert Towne won for Best Original Screenplay. It also had actor-director John Huston in a supporting role, and was the last film Polanski directed in the United States. In 1991, the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot; and it is frequently listed as among the best in world cinema.

 &quot;The Tenant&quot; (1976)
Polanski returned to Paris for his next film, &quot;The Tenant&quot; (1976), which was based on a 1964 novel by Roland Topor, a French writer of Polish-Jewish origin. In addition to directing the film, Polanski also played a leading role of a timid Polish immigrant living in Paris. Together with &quot;Repulsion&quot; and &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, &quot;The Tenant&quot; can be seen as the third installment in a loose trilogy of films called the &quot;Apartment Trilogy&quot; that explores the themes of social alienation and psychic and emotional breakdown.

In 1978, Polanski became a fugitive from American justice and could no longer work in countries where he might face arrest or extradition.

=== 1979–2004 ===

 &quot;Tess&quot; (1979)
He dedicated his next film, &quot;Tess&quot; (1979), to the memory of his late wife, Sharon Tate. It was Tate who first suggested he read &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;, which she thought would make a good film; he subsequently expected her to star in it. Nearly a decade after Tate&#x27;s death, he met Nastassja Kinski, a model and aspiring young actress who had already been in a number of European films. He offered her the starring role, which she accepted. Her father was Klaus Kinski, a leading German actor, who had introduced her to films.

Because the role required having a local dialect, Polanski sent her to London for five months of study and to spend time in the Dorset countryside to get a flavor of the region. In the film, Kinski starred opposite Peter Firth and Leigh Lawson.
&quot;Tess&quot; was shot in the north of France instead of Hardy&#x27;s England and became the most expensive film made in France up to that time. Ultimately, it proved a financial success and was well received by both critics and the public. Polanski won France&#x27;s César Awards for Best Picture and Best Director and received his fourth Academy Award nomination (and his second nomination for Best Director). The film received three Oscars: best cinematography, best art direction, best costume design, and was nominated for best picture.

At the time, there were rumors that Polanski and Kinski became romantically involved, which he confirmed in a 1994 interview with Diane Sawyer, but Nastassja says the rumors are untrue; they were never lovers or had an affair. She admits that &quot;there was a flirtation. There &quot;could&quot; have been a seduction, but there was not. He had respect for me.&quot; She also recalls his influence on her while filming: &quot;He was really a gentleman, not at all like the things I had heard. He introduced me to beautiful books, plays, movies. He educated me.&quot; On an emotional level, she said years later that &quot;he was one of the people in my life who cared, ... who took me seriously and gave me a lot of strength.&quot; She told David Letterman more about her experience working with Polanski during an interview.

In 1981, Polanski directed and co-starred (as Mozart) in a stage production of Peter Shaffer&#x27;s play &quot;Amadeus&quot;, first in Warsaw, then in Paris. The play was again directed by Polanski, in Milan, in 1999.

 &quot;Pirates&quot; (1986)
Nearly seven years passed before Polanski&#x27;s next film, &quot;Pirates&quot;, a lavish period piece starring Walter Matthau as Captain Red, which the director intended as an homage to the beloved Errol Flynn swashbucklers of his childhood. Captain Red&#x27;s henchman, Jean Baptiste, was played by Cris Campion. The film is about a rebellion the two led on a ship called the &quot;Neptune&quot;, in the seventeenth century. The screenplay was written by Polanski, Gérard Brach, and John Brownjohn. The film was shot on location in Tunisia, using a full-sized pirate vessel constructed for the production. It was a financial and critical failure, recovering a small fraction of its production budget and garnering a single Academy Award nomination.

 &quot;Frantic&quot; (1988)
&quot;Frantic&quot; (1988) was a Hitchcockian suspense-thriller starring Harrison Ford and the actress/model Emmanuelle Seigner, who later became Polanski&#x27;s wife. The film follows an ordinary tourist in Paris whose wife is kidnapped. He attempts, hopelessly, to go through the Byzantine bureaucratic channels to deal with her disappearance, but finally takes matters into his own hands. The film was a commercial failure but received positive reviews from critics.

 &quot;Bitter Moon&quot; (1992)
In 1992 Polanski followed with the dark psycho-sexual film &quot;Bitter Moon&quot;. The film starred Seigner, Hugh Grant, and Kristin Scott Thomas. Film critic Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Whatever else Mr. Polanski may be – nasty, mocking, darkly subversive in his view of the world – he definitely isn&#x27;t dull. &quot;Bitter Moon&quot; is the kind of world-class, defiantly bad film that has a life of its own.&quot;

 &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; (1994)
In 1994 Polanski directed a film of the acclaimed play &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; starring Ben Kingsley and Sigourney Weaver. The film is based on the Ariel Dorfman play of the same name. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised Polanski on his directing writing, &quot;Death and the Maiden is all about acting. In other hands, even given the same director, this might have been a dreary slog.&quot;

 &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; (1997)

In 1997, Polanski directed a stage version of his 1967 film &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot;, which debuted in Vienna followed by successful runs in Stuttgart, Hamburg, Berlin, and Budapest.

On 1998, Polanski was elected a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts.
 &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; (1999)

&quot;The Ninth Gate&quot; is a thriller based on the novel &quot;El Club Dumas&quot; by Arturo Perez-Reverte and starring Johnny Depp. The movie&#x27;s plot is based on the idea that an ancient text called &quot;The Nine Gates of the Kingdom of Shadows&quot;, authored by Aristide Torchia along with Lucifer, is the key to raising Satan.

 &quot;The Pianist&quot; (2002)

In 2001, Polanski filmed &quot;The Pianist&quot;, an adaptation of the World War II autobiography of the same name by Polish-Jewish musician Władysław Szpilman. Szpilman&#x27;s experiences as a persecuted Jew in Poland during World War II were reminiscent of those of Polanski and his family. While Szpilman and Polanski escaped the concentration camps, their families did not, eventually perishing.

When Warsaw, Poland, was chosen for the 2002 premiere of &quot;The Pianist&quot;, &quot;the country exploded with pride&quot;. According to reports, numerous former communists came to the screening and &quot;agreed that it was a fantastic film&quot;. In May 2002, the film won the (Golden Palm) award at the Cannes Film Festival, as well as Césars for Best Film and Best Director.

The film was released in North America to critical acclaim. Roger Ebert praised in particular Polanski, writing, &quot;[His] direction is masterful.&quot; and added &quot;Polanski is reflecting, I believe, his own deepest feelings: that he survived, but need not have, and that his mother died and left a wound that had never healed.&quot; Polanski later won the 2002 Academy Award for Best Director. Because Polanski would have been arrested in the United States, he did not attend the Academy Awards ceremony in Hollywood. After the announcement of the Best Director Award, Polanski received a standing ovation from most of those present in the theater. Actor Harrison Ford accepted the award for Polanski and then presented the Oscar to him at the Deauville Film Festival five months later in a public ceremony. Polanski later received the Crystal Globe award for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in 2004.

=== 2005–present ===
 &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (2005)

&quot;Oliver Twist&quot; is an adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; novel, written by &quot;The Pianist&quot;″s Ronald Harwood and shot in Prague. Polanski said in interviews that he made the film as something he could show his children and that the life of the young scavenger mirrored his own life, fending for himself in World War II Poland.

 &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot; (2010)

&quot;The Ghost Writer&quot;, a thriller focusing on a ghostwriter working on the memoirs of a character based loosely on former British prime minister Tony Blair, swept the European Film Awards in 2010, winning six awards, including best movie, director, actor and screenplay. When it premiered at the 60th Berlinale in February 2010, Polanski won a Silver Bear for Best Director, and in February 2011, it won four César Awards, France&#x27;s version of the Academy Awards.

The film is based on the novel by British writer Robert Harris. Harris and Polanski had previously worked for many months on a film of Harris&#x27;s earlier novel &quot;Pompeii&quot;, a novel that was in turn inspired by Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Chinatown&quot;. They had completed a script for &quot;Pompeii&quot; and were nearing production when the film was cancelled due to a looming actors&#x27; strike in September 2007. After that film fell apart, they moved on to Harris&#x27;s novel, The Ghost, and adapted it for the screen together.

The cast includes Ewan McGregor as the writer and Pierce Brosnan as former British Prime Minister Adam Lang. The film was shot on locations in Germany.

In the United States, film critic Roger Ebert included it in his top 10 picks for 2010 and states that &quot;this movie is the work of a man who knows how to direct a thriller. Smooth, calm, confident, it builds suspense instead of depending on shock and action.&quot; Co-star Ewan McGregor agreed, having said about Polanski that &quot;he&#x27;s a legend ... I&#x27;ve never examined a director and the way that they work so much before. He&#x27;s brilliant, just brilliant, and absolutely warrants his reputation as a great director.&quot;
 &quot;Carnage&quot; (2011)

Polanski shot &quot;Carnage&quot; in February/March 2011. The film is a screen version of Yasmina Reza&#x27;s play &quot;God of Carnage&quot;, a comedy about two couples who meet after their children get in a fight at school, and how their initially civilized conversation devolves into chaos. It stars Kate Winslet, Jodie Foster, Christoph Waltz and John C. Reilly. Though set in New York, it was shot in Paris. The film had its world premiere on 9 September 2011 at the Venice Film Festival and was released in the United States by Sony Pictures Classics on 16 December 2011.

Co-stars Jodie Foster and Kate Winslet commented about Polanski&#x27;s directing style. According to Foster, &quot;He has a very, very definitive style about how he likes it done. He decides everything. He decided every lens. Every prop. Everything. It&#x27;s all him.&quot; Winslet adds that &quot;Roman is one of the most extraordinary men I&#x27;ve ever met. The guy is 77 years old. He has an effervescent quality to him. He&#x27;s very joyful about his work, which is infectious. He likes to have a small crew, to the point that, when I walked on the set, my thought was, &#x27;My God, this is it?&#x27;&quot; Also noting that style of directing, New York Film Festival director Richard Pena, during the American premiere of the film, called Polanski &quot;a poet of small spaces ... in just a couple of rooms he can conjure up an entire world, an entire society.&quot;

Polanski makes an uncredited cameo appearance as a neighbor.

 &quot;Venus in Fur&quot; (2013)
Polanski&#x27;s French-language adaptation of the play &quot;Venus in Fur&quot;, stars his wife Emmanuelle Seigner and Mathieu Amalric. Polanski worked with the play&#x27;s author, David Ives, on the screenplay. The film was shot from December 2012 to February 2013 in French and is Polanski&#x27;s first non-English-language feature film in forty years. The film premiered in competition at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival on 25 May 2013.

 &quot;Based on a True Story&quot; (2017)
Polanski&#x27;s &quot;Based on a True Story&quot; is an adaptation of the French novel by bestselling author Delphine de Vignan. The film follows a writer (Emmanuelle Seigner) struggling to complete a new novel, while followed by an obsessed fan (Eva Green). It started production in November 2016 from a script adapted by Polanski and Olivier Assayas. It premiered out of competition at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival on 27 May 2017 and opened in France on 1 November 2017.

Expulsion from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences

In May 2018, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences stated that the board &quot;has voted to expel actor Bill Cosby and director Roman Polanski from its membership in accordance with the organisation&#x27;s Standards of Conduct.&quot; Polanski is one of only four members to have been expelled from the academy. Following its expulsion of Harvey Weinstein, the academy&#x27;s Standards of Conduct had recently been revised as a result of impacts of the #MeToo and Time&#x27;s Up movements on the film industry. The same year, his wife Emmanuelle Seigner rejected the invitation to join the academy, denouncing the &quot;hypocrisy&quot; of a group that expelled Polanski.

&quot;An Officer and a Spy&quot; (2019)

Polanski&#x27;s 2019 film &quot;An Officer and a Spy&quot;, centers on the notorious 19th century Dreyfus affair. The film stars Jean Dujardin as French officer Georges Picquart and follows his struggle from 1896–1906 to expose the truth about the doctored evidence that led to Alfred Dreyfus, one of the few Jewish members of the French Army&#x27;s general staff, being wrongly convicted of passing military secrets to the German Empire and sent to Devil&#x27;s Island. The film is written by Robert Harris, who was working with Polanski for the third time. It co-stars Louis Garrel as Dreyfus, Mathieu Amalric and Polanski&#x27;s wife Emmanuelle Seigner. It was produced by Alain Goldman&#x27;s Legende Films and distributed by Gaumont. Filming began on 26 November 2018 and was completed on 28 April 2019.

Although set in Paris, the film was first scheduled to shoot in Warsaw in 2014, for economic reasons. However, production was postponed after Polanski moved to Poland for filming and the U.S. Government filed extradition papers. The Polish government eventually rejected them, by which time new French film tax credits had been introduced, allowing the film to shoot on location in Paris. It was budgeted at €60m and was again set to start production in July 2016, however its production was postponed as Polanski waited on the availability of a star, whose name was not announced. In a 2017 interview Polanski discussed the difficulty of the project:
It had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on 30 August 2019. It received a standing ovation and won the Grand Jury Prize. It was released in France on 13 November 2019, by Gaumont. The film has received backlash due to the plot of the film relating to Polanski&#x27;s sexual abuse case and further accusations of harassment and assault.

Polanski caused outrage by comparing his own experience&#x27;s to Dreyfus&#x27;s. In an interview to promote the film, Polanski said: &quot;I am familiar with many of the workings of the apparatus of persecution shown in the film... I can see the same determination to deny the facts and condemn me for things I have not done. Most of the people who harass me do not know me and know nothing about the case.&quot; Aside from Polanski&#x27;s involvement, the film was not controversial and was generally well reviewed.

In February 2020, Polanski won Best Director at France&#x27;s 2020 Cesar Awards. Neither Polanski nor the cast and crew of &quot;An Officer and a Spy&quot; (&quot;J&#x27;accuse&quot;) attended the awards ceremony hosted at the Salle Pleyel in Paris. Polanski said that he will not submit himself to a &quot;public lynching&quot; over rape accusations he denies. Addressing the accusations of sexual assault leveled at him, he said, &quot;Fantasies of unhealthy minds are now treated as proven facts.&quot; This is Polanski&#x27;s fifth Best Director Cesar win, the record for a single director; he previously won for &quot;Tess&quot;, &quot;The Pianist&quot;, &quot;The Ghost Writer&quot;, and &quot;Venus in Fur&quot;. Polanski&#x27;s wife Emmanuelle Seigner accepted the award on his behalf.

Prior to the awards ceremony, Polanski released a statement, saying, &quot;For several days, people have asked me this question: Will I or won&#x27;t I attend the Cesar ceremony? The question I ask in turn is this: How could I?. [...] The way the night will unfold, we already know in advance,&quot; he continued. &quot;Activists have already threatened me with a public lynching, some have announced protests in front of the Salle Pleyel. Others intend to make it a platform to denounce (the) governing body. It promises to look more like a symposium than a celebration of cinema.&quot; Polanski said he was skipping the ceremony in order to protect his team as well as his wife and children, who &quot;have been made to suffer injuries and affronts.&quot; Making reference to the recent media scandal that led to the Cesar board&#x27;s mass resignation, Polanski added: &quot;The press and social media have presented our 12 nominations as if they were gifts offered to us by the academy&#x27;s board of directors, as some authoritarian gesture that had forced their resignations. Doing so undermines the secret vote of the 4,313 professionals who alone decide the nominations and the more than 1.5 million viewers who came to see the film.&quot;

Despite Polanski&#x27;s absence from the awards ceremony, his nomination and win sparked protests due to the rape charges that he still faces. The protestors held up signs with slogans like &quot;Shame on an industry that protects rapists.&quot; Police clashed with protestors, even firing tear gas upon them. Actions were also taken by celebrities, such as Adèle Haenel, Noémie Merlant, and Celine Sciamma who walked out of the awards. Many other celebrities and feminists spoke out against Polanski online, such as NousToutes, a French feminist collective, who called the win &quot;shameful&quot;, and Jessica Chastain tweeted, &quot;I Fucking Stan&quot; in regard to the protests. At the same time some celebrities came to his defense, like actress Fanny Ardant, who said, &quot;When I love someone, I love them passionately. And I love Roman Polanski a lot... a lot... So I&#x27;m very happy for him. Then, I understand that not everyone agrees but long live freedom!&quot; and actress Brigitte Bardot who said, &quot;Thankfully Polanski exists and he is saving cinema from its mediocrity! I judge him on his talent and not on his private life! I regret never having shot with him!&quot; The actor Lambert Wilson called the protest campaign against Polanski &quot;abominable public lynching&quot;, as did Isabelle Huppert, who stated that &quot;lynching is a form of pornography&quot;. Likewise, Polanski&#x27;s alleged victim Samantha Geimer criticized the protesters as &quot;very opportunistic&quot;, and said that &quot;If you want to change the world today, you do it by... demanding people be held accountable today, not by picking someone who is famous and thinking that if you demonise him for things that happened decades ago that somehow that has any value in protecting people and changing society&quot;.

&quot;The Palace&quot; (2023)

&quot;The Palace&quot; began filming in February 2022 in Gstaad, Switzerland. The film stars Mickey Rourke, Fanny Ardant, and Oliver Masucci, and is a black comedy about the guests at a Swiss luxury hotel on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1999. Polanski co-wrote the screenplay with fellow Polish director Jerzy Skolimowski, who also co-wrote Polanski&#x27;s first feature, &quot;Knife in the Water&quot;, in 1962. The film was unable to find financing in France due to souring French public opinion of Polanski following a new round of sexual assault allegations, and ended up being primarily funded by the Italian company, RAI Cinema. Polanski&#x27;s reputation also brought casting challenges, with a number of actors turning down roles for fear of tarnishing their careers. RAI Cinema and Eliseo Entertainment produced the film. The film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on 2 September 2023, before it was released theatrically in Italy by 01 Distribution on 28 September 2023.

2023 Venice Film Festival controversy

The inclusion of films from Polanski, Woody Allen, and Luc Besson at the 2023 Venice Film Festival was controversial and brought significant criticism to its organizers due to the various sex abuse allegations against all three. Festival head Alberto Barbera defended their inclusion, saying of Polanski specifically, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand why one cannot distinguish between the responsibilities of the man and those of the artist. Polanski is 90 years old, he is one of the few working masters, he made an extraordinary film. It may be the last film of his career, although I hope he does like De Oliveira, who made films until he was 105. I stand firmly among those who in the debate distinguish between the responsibility of the man and that of the artist.&quot;

== Personal life ==

In 1959, Polanski married actress Barbara Kwiatkowska-Lass. She starred in his short film &quot;When Angels Fall&quot;. The couple separated in 1961 and divorced the next year.

Throughout the 1960s, Polanski dated a succession of actresses including Carol Lynley, Jacqueline Bisset, Jill St. John and Michelle Phillips.

Polanski met actress Sharon Tate while filming &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot;, and during the production, the two of them began dating. On 1968, Polanski and Tate married in London.

In February 1969, Polanski and Tate began renting the home at 10050 Cielo Drive in the Benedict Canyon region of Los Angeles. In August, while Polanski was in Europe working on a film, Tate remained home, eight-and-a-half months pregnant. The Manson Family cult broke into the home late in the evening of 8 August and proceeded to murder Tate and four others. Tate&#x27;s unborn child was posthumously named Paul Richard Polanski. Charles Manson, along with members of the cult, was arrested in late 1969, eventually tried, and found guilty in 1971 of first-degree murder.

Polanski has said that his absence on the night of the murders is the greatest regret of his life. He wrote in his autobiography: &quot;Sharon&#x27;s death is the only watershed in my life that really matters&quot;, and commented that her murder changed his personality from a &quot;boundless, untroubled sea of expectations and optimism&quot; to one of &quot;ingrained pessimism... eternal dissatisfaction with life&quot;. Polanski was left with a negative impression of the press, which he felt was interested in sensationalizing the lives of the victims, and indirectly himself, to attract readers. He was shocked by the lack of sympathy expressed in various news stories:

In 1989, Polanski married French actress Emmanuelle Seigner. They have two children, daughter Morgane and son Elvis. Polanski and his children speak Polish at home.

== Legal history ==

In 1977, Polanski was arrested and charged with drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl. As a result of a plea bargain, he pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of unlawful sex with a minor. In 1978, after learning that the judge planned to reject his plea deal and impose a prison term instead of probation, he fled to Paris. A number of other women have later accused Polanski of raping them when they were teenagers. An Interpol red notice was issued for his arrest, and he rarely leaves France.

=== Sexual abuse ===
On 11 March 1977, three years after making &quot;Chinatown&quot;, Polanski was arrested at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel for the sexual assault of 13-year-old Samantha Gailey. Gailey had modeled for Polanski during a &quot;Vogue&quot; photoshoot the previous day around the swimming pool at the Bel Air home of Polanski was indicted on six counts of criminal behavior, including rape. At his arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to all charges. Many executives in Hollywood came to his defense. Gailey&#x27;s attorney arranged a plea bargain in which five of the six charges would be dismissed, and Polanski accepted.
As a result of the plea bargain, Polanski pleaded guilty to the charge of &quot;unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor&quot;, and was ordered to undergo 90 days of psychiatric evaluation at California Institution for Men at Chino. Upon release from prison after 42 days, Polanski agreed to the plea bargain, his penalty to be time served along with probation. However, he learned afterward that the judge, Laurence J. Rittenband, had told some friends that he was going to disregard the plea bargain and sentence Polanski to 50 years in prison: &quot;I&#x27;ll see this man never gets out of jail&quot;, he told Polanski&#x27;s friend, screenwriter Howard E. Koch. Gailey&#x27;s attorney confirmed the judge changed his mind after he met the judge in his chambers:
Polanski was told by his attorney that &quot;the judge could no longer be trusted&quot; and that the judge&#x27;s representations were &quot;worthless&quot;. Polanski decided not to appear at his sentencing. He told his friend, producer Dino De Laurentiis, &quot;I&#x27;ve made up my mind. I&#x27;m getting out of here.&quot; the day before sentencing, Polanski left the country on a flight to where he had a home. One day later, he left for As a French citizen, he has been protected from extradition and has lived mostly in France since then.

In 1979, Polanski gave a controversial interview with novelist Martin Amis in which, discussing the case, he said &quot;If I had killed somebody, it wouldn&#x27;t have had so much appeal to the press, you see? But ... fucking, you see, and the young girls. Judges want to fuck young girls. Juries want to fuck young girls. Everyone wants to fuck young girls!&quot;

In 1988, Gailey sued Polanski. Among other things, the suit alleged sexual assault, false imprisonment, seduction of a minor, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In 1993, Polanski agreed to settle with his victim. In August 1996, Polanski still owed her $604,416; court filings confirm that the settlement was completed by 1997 via a confidential financial arrangement. The victim, now married and going by the name Samantha Geimer, stated in a 2003 interview with Larry King that the police and media had been slow at the time of the assault to believe her account, which she attributed to the social climate of the era. In 2008, she stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t wish for him to be held to further punishment or consequences.&quot;

On 26 September 2009, Polanski was arrested while in Switzerland at the request of United States authorities. The arrest brought renewed attention to the case and stirred controversy, particularly in the United States and Europe. Polanski was defended by many prominent individuals, including Hollywood celebrities and European artists and politicians, who called for his release. American public opinion was reported to run against him, and polls in France and Poland showed that strong majorities favored his extradition to the United States.

Polanski was jailed near Zurich for two months, then put under house arrest at his home in Gstaad while awaiting the results of his extradition appeals. On 12 July 2010, the Swiss rejected the United States&#x27; request, declared Polanski a &quot;free man&quot; and released him from custody. A year later, he was invited to the 2011 Zurich Film Festival where he received a lifetime achievement award. An Interpol red notice was issued in 1978 after he fled the United States, limiting his movements to France, Switzerland, and Poland. However, his name is no longer found on Interpol&#x27;s wanted list.

During a television interview on 10 March 2011, Geimer blamed the media, reporters, the court, and the judge for having caused &quot;way more damage to me and my family than anything Roman Polanski has ever done&quot;, and opined that the judge was using her and Polanski for media exposure.

In January 2014, newly uncovered emails from 2008 by a Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge, Larry P. Fidler, indicated that if Polanski returned to the United States for a hearing, the conduct of the judge who had originally presided over the case, Laurence A. Rittenband, might require that Polanski be freed. These emails were related to a 2008 documentary film by Marina Zenovich.

In late October 2014, Polanski was questioned by Polish prosecutors in Kraków. On 30 October 2015, Polish judge Dariusz Mazur denied a request by the United States to extradite Polanski, who has dual French–Polish citizenship, for a full trial, claiming that it would be &quot;obviously unlawful&quot;. The Kraków prosecutor&#x27;s office declined to challenge the court&#x27;s ruling, agreeing that Polanski had served his punishment and did not need to face an American court ever again.

Poland&#x27;s national justice ministry appealed, arguing that sexual abuse of minors should be prosecuted regardless of the suspect&#x27;s accomplishments or the length of time since the suspected crime took place. In a December 2016 decision, the Supreme Court of Poland dismissed the government&#x27;s appeal, holding that the prosecutor general had failed to prove misconduct or flagrant legal error on the part of the lower court.

Preparations for &quot;An Officer and a Spy&quot; had been stalled by the extradition request.

On 3 May 2018, Polanski was removed from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, with the decision referencing the case.

Polanski has blamed Harvey Weinstein for the renewed focus on his sexual abuse case in the 2000s and claimed that Weinstein tried to brand him a &quot;child rapist&quot; to stop him from winning an Oscar in 2003.

In March 2023, Geimer and her husband met with Polanski and his wife Seigner for a French magazine cover interview. Geimer states in the interview: &quot;Let me be very clear: what happened with Polanski was never a big problem for me. I didn&#x27;t even know it was illegal, that someone could be arrested for it. I was fine, I&#x27;m still fine. It was so unfair and so in opposition to justice ... Everyone should know by now that Roman has served his sentence. Which was ... long if you want my opinion. Anyone who thinks that he deserves to be in prison is wrong. It isn&#x27;t the case today and it wasn&#x27;t the case yesterday.&quot;

====Documentary films====
In 2008, the documentary film by Marina Zenovich, &quot;Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired&quot;, was released in Europe and the United States where it won numerous awards. The film focuses on the judge in the case and the possible reasons why he changed his mind. It includes interviews with people involved in the case, including the victim, Geimer, and the prosecutor, Roger Gunson. Geimer said that the judge &quot;didn&#x27;t care what happened&quot; to her or Polanski, but &quot;was orchestrating some little show&quot;, while Gunson added, &quot;I&#x27;m not surprised that Polanski left under those circumstances, ... it was going to be a real circus.&quot;

Former Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney David Wells, whose statements were the most damning evidence in the movie, and who said he advised the judge to imprison Polanski, admitted that he lied about those statements, and said that to the documentary makers to &quot;play up&quot; his own role.

In December 2009, a California appellate court discussed the film&#x27;s allegations as it denied Polanski&#x27;s request to have the case dismissed. While saying it was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; by the allegations, and that the allegations were &quot;in many cases supported by considerable evidence&quot;, it also found that &quot;Even in light of our fundamental concern about the misconduct ... flight was not Polanski&#x27;s only option. It was not even his best option.&quot; It said dismissal of the case, which would erase Polanski&#x27;s guilty plea, would not be an &quot;appropriate result&quot;, and that he still had other legal options.

In September 2011, the documentary film &quot;Roman Polanski: A Film Memoir&quot; had its world premiere in Zurich, Switzerland. During an interview in the film, he offers his apology to Geimer: &quot;She is a double victim: My victim, and a victim of the press.&quot; On this occasion, he collected the lifetime achievement award he was to have received at the time of his arrest two years earlier.

=== &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; libel case ===
In 2004, Polanski sued &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine in London for libel. A 2002 article in the magazine claimed that Polanski promised he would &quot;make another Sharon Tate out of you&quot; in an attempt to seduce a Scandinavian model while he was travelling to Tate&#x27;s funeral. He received supporting testimony from Mia Farrow, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; &quot;was unable to prove that the incident occurred&quot;. Polanski was awarded £50,000 in damages plus some of his legal costs.

=== Matan Uziel libel case ===
In December 2017, Polanski filed a ₪1.5 million suit in Herzliya Magistrates&#x27; Court against Israeli journalist and filmmaker Matan Uziel. Polanski maintained that Uziel, through his website, www.imetpolanski.com, falsely reported that five women had come forward to accuse him of raping them. Polanski was suing for libel and defamation of character. Herzliya Magistrates&#x27; Court rejected Polanski&#x27;s request to be exempt from appearing in court after filing the libel suit. While Polanski gave various reasons for his inability to appear, the presiding judge, Gilad Hess, dismissed them one by one and ordered Polanski to pay Uziel ₪10,000 in costs. In November 2018, it was published that Polanski decided to drop the lawsuit, and was ordered by the court to pay Uziel ₪30,000 (US$8,000) for court costs. The court accepted Uziel&#x27;s request that the suit not be dropped, but rather that it be rejected, making Polanski unable to sue Uziel again over the same issue in the future.

In late December 2019, in Polanski&#x27;s interviews with &quot;Paris Match&quot; and , the latter accused Matan Uziel of carefully orchestrating the attacks on his character and for playing a major role in designing an international campaign to besmirch his name and reputation in order to make his career fall from grace.

In November 2022, Polanski filed a cybersquatting dispute with World Intellectual Property Organization against the domain name imetpolanski.com. Polanski asked World Intellectual Property Organization to rule that the site was cybersquatting. However, the three-person panel ruled that Polanski did not show the domain was registered and used in bad faith, nor did he show that the registrant, Matan Uziel, lacked rights or legitimate interests in the domain name.

=== Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences case ===
In April 2019, following his expulsion from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Polanski filed a lawsuit against the academy alleging that the decision to expel him was not appropriately supported and demanding his reinstatement. In August 2020 his expulsion was upheld by the court with the judge finding that the academy&#x27;s board had given Polanski a fair hearing and that they had cause to expel him.

=== Charlotte Lewis ===
In 2010, lawyer Gloria Allred appeared in a press conference with British actress Charlotte Lewis, where she stated that Polanski had forced himself on her while she was auditioning for &quot;Pirates&quot; in Paris in 1983, which she was later cast in. &quot;He sexually abused me in the worst possible way when I was just 16 years old, four years after he fled the United States to avoid sentencing for his crime.&quot; In 1999, Lewis had an interview with the UK&#x27;s &quot;News of the World&quot; where she asserted that she had a six-month tryst with Polanski when she was 17. Lewis also talked about how Polanski treated her in the relationship: &quot;Roman would say, ‘You’re gaining weight’. It was ridiculous —I was a thin teenage girl, but I took it seriously and stopped eating. Then I&#x27;d overeat, and for years I suffered from bulimia. I know that was the start.&quot; During an interview with Paris Match in 2019, Roman Polanski was asked about Charlotte Lewis&#x27; accusations, to which he responded &quot;It&#x27;s an odious lie!&quot; He also pulled out a press clipping of her 1999 interview, quoting her talk about having sex with many men by the age of 14. In the interview Lewis discloses that she was drugged and prostituted at 14, which led to her sexual promiscuity and her relationship with numerous film stars, including Polanski.

Lewis alleged Polanski led a smear campaign against her, primarily founded on the Paris Match interview, and in September 2022 Polanski was ordered to stand trial in France for Lewis&#x27; defamation case. Polanski was acquitted of this defamation on 14 May 2024. He was not present in court for the verdict.

===2024 civil complaint===
In March 2024, Polanski was sued in the Los Angeles Superior Court by a woman who alleged that he raped her at his home in 1973 after supplying her with tequila shots. The woman was said to be under the age of 18 at the time. Polanski, who is facing a civil trial for this allegation, had his trial date set for August 2025.

=== Other allegations ===
In October 2017, German actress Renate Langer told Swiss police that Polanski raped her in Gstaad when she was 15, in 1972. The same month, American artist Marianne Barnard accused Polanski of having sexually assaulted her in 1975, when she was 10 years old.

In November 2019, French actress Valentine Monnier said Polanski raped her at a ski chalet in Gstaad in 1975.

<text>Russian is an East Slavic language belonging to the Balto-Slavic branch of the Indo-European language family. It is one of the four extant East Slavic languages, and is the native language of the Russians. It was the &quot;de facto&quot; and &quot;de jure&quot; official language of the former Soviet Union. Russian has remained an official language of the Russian Federation, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan, and is still commonly used as a lingua franca in Ukraine, Moldova, the Caucasus, Central Asia, and to a lesser extent in the Baltic states and Israel.

Russian has over 258 million total speakers worldwide. It is the most spoken native language in Europe, the most spoken Slavic language, as well as the most geographically widespread language of Eurasia. It is the world&#x27;s seventh-most spoken language by number of native speakers, and the world&#x27;s ninth-most spoken language by total number of speakers. Russian is one of two official languages aboard the International Space Station, one of the six official languages of the United Nations, as well as the fourth most widely used language on the Internet.

Russian is written using the Russian alphabet of the Cyrillic script; it distinguishes between consonant phonemes with palatal secondary articulation and those without—the so-called &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;hard&quot; sounds. Almost every consonant has a hard or soft counterpart, and the distinction is a prominent feature of the language, which is usually shown in writing not by a change of the consonant but rather by changing the following vowel. Another important aspect is the reduction of unstressed vowels. Stress, which is often unpredictable, is not normally indicated orthographically, though an optional acute accent may be used to mark stress – such as to distinguish between homographic words (e.g. [, &#x27;lock&#x27;] and [, &#x27;castle&#x27;]), or to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words or names.

== Classification ==
Russian is an East Slavic language of the wider Indo-European family. It is a descendant of Old East Slavic, a language used in Kievan Rus&#x27;, which was a loose conglomerate of East Slavic tribes from the late 9th to the mid-13th centuries. From the point of view of spoken language, its closest relatives are Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Rusyn, the other three languages in the East Slavic branch. In many places in eastern and southern Ukraine and throughout Belarus, these languages are spoken interchangeably, and in certain areas traditional bilingualism resulted in language mixtures such as Surzhyk in eastern Ukraine and Trasianka in Belarus. An East Slavic Old Novgorod dialect, although it vanished during the 15th or 16th century, is sometimes considered to have played a significant role in the formation of modern Russian. Also, Russian has notable lexical similarities with Bulgarian due to a common Church Slavonic influence on both languages, but because of later interaction in the 19th and 20th centuries, Bulgarian grammar differs markedly from Russian.

Over the course of centuries, the vocabulary and literary style of Russian have also been influenced by Western and Central European languages such as Greek, Latin, Polish, Dutch, German, French, Italian, and English, and to a lesser extent the languages to the south and the east: Uralic, Turkic, Persian, Arabic, and Hebrew.

According to the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, Russian is classified as a level III language in terms of learning difficulty for native English speakers, requiring approximately 1,100 hours of immersion instruction to achieve intermediate fluency.

== Standard Russian ==
Feudal divisions and conflicts created obstacles between the Russian principalities before and especially during Mongol rule. This strengthened dialectal differences, and for a while, prevented the emergence of a standardized national language. The formation of the unified and centralized Russian state in the 15th and 16th centuries, and the gradual re-emergence of a common political, economic, and cultural space created the need for a common standard language. The initial impulse for standardization came from the government bureaucracy for the lack of a reliable tool of communication in administrative, legal, and judicial affairs became an obvious practical problem. The earliest attempts at standardizing Russian were made based on the so-called Moscow official or chancery language, during the 15th to 17th centuries. Since then, the trend of language policy in Russia has been standardization in both the restricted sense of reducing dialectical barriers between ethnic Russians, and the broader sense of expanding the use of Russian alongside or in favour of other languages.

The current standard form of Russian is generally regarded as the &quot;modern Russian literary language&quot; ( – &quot;sovremenny russky literaturny yazyk&quot;). It arose at the beginning of the 18th century with the modernization reforms of the Russian state under the rule of Peter the Great and developed from the Moscow (Middle or Central Russian) dialect substratum under the influence of some of the previous century&#x27;s Russian chancery language.

Prior to the Bolshevik Revolution, the spoken form of the Russian language was that of the nobility and the urban bourgeoisie. Russian peasants, the great majority of the population, continued to speak in their own dialects. However, the peasants&#x27; speech was never systematically studied, as it was generally regarded by philologists as simply a source of folklore and an object of curiosity. This was acknowledged by the noted Russian dialectologist Nikolai Karinsky, who toward the end of his life wrote: &quot;Scholars of Russian dialects mostly studied phonetics and morphology. Some scholars and collectors compiled local dictionaries. We have almost no studies of lexical material or the syntax of Russian dialects.&quot;

After 1917, Marxist linguists had no interest in the multiplicity of peasant dialects and regarded their language as a relic of the rapidly disappearing past that was not worthy of scholarly attention. Nakhimovsky quotes the Soviet academicians A.M Ivanov and L.P Yakubinsky, writing in 1930:

The language of peasants has a motley diversity inherited from feudalism. On its way to becoming proletariat peasantry brings to the factory and the industrial plant their local peasant dialects with their phonetics, grammar, and vocabulary, and the very process of recruiting workers from peasants and the mobility of the worker population generate another process: the liquidation of peasant inheritance by way of leveling the particulars of local dialects. On the ruins of peasant multilingual, in the context of developing heavy industry, a qualitatively new entity can be said to emerge—the general language of the working class... capitalism has the tendency of creating the general urban language of a given society.

== Geographic distribution ==

In 2010, there were 259.8 million speakers of Russian in the world: in Russia – 137.5 million, in the CIS and Baltic countries – 93.7 million, in Eastern Europe – 12.9 million, Western Europe – 7.3 million, Asia – 2.7 million, in the Middle East and North Africa – 1.3 million, Sub-Saharan Africa – 0.1 million, Latin America – 0.2 million, U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand – 4.1 million speakers. Therefore, the Russian language is the seventh-largest in the world by the number of speakers, after English, Mandarin, Hindi-Urdu, Spanish, French, Arabic, and Portuguese.

Russian is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. Education in Russian is still a popular choice for both Russian as a second language (RSL) and native speakers in Russia, and in many former Soviet republics. Russian is still seen as an important language for children to learn in most of the former Soviet republics.

=== Europe ===


In Belarus, Russian is a second state language alongside Belarusian per the Constitution of Belarus. 77% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 67% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work. According to the 2019 Belarusian census, out of 9,413,446 inhabitants of the country, 5,094,928 (54.1% of the total population) named Belarusian as their native language, with 61.2% of ethnic Belarusians and 54.5% of ethnic Poles declaring Belarusian as their native language. In everyday life in the Belarusian society the Russian language prevails, so according to the 2019 census 6,718,557 people (71.4% of the total population) stated that they speak Russian at home, for ethnic Belarusians this share is 61.4%, for Russians — 97.2%, for Ukrainians — 89.0%, for Poles — 52.4%, and for Jews — 96.6%; 2,447,764 people (26.0% of the total population) stated that the language they usually speak at home is Belarusian, among ethnic Belarusians this share is 28.5%; the highest share of those who speak Belarusian at home is among ethnic Poles — 46.0%.

In Estonia, Russian is spoken by 29.6% of the population, according to a 2011 estimate from the World Factbook, and is officially considered a foreign language. School education in the Russian language is a very contentious point in Estonian politics, and in 2022, the parliament approved a bill to close up all Russian language schools and kindergartens by the school year. The transition to only Estonian language schools and kindergartens will start in the 2024–2025 school year.

In Latvia, Russian is officially considered a foreign language. 55% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 26% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work. On 18 February 2012, Latvia held a constitutional referendum on whether to adopt Russian as a second official language. According to the Central Election Commission, 74.8% voted against, 24.9% voted for and the voter turnout was 71.1%. Starting in 2019, instruction in Russian will be gradually discontinued in private colleges and universities in Latvia, and in general instruction in Latvian public high schools. On 29 September 2022, Saeima passed in the final reading amendments that state that all schools and kindergartens in the country are to transition to education in Latvian. From 2025, all children will be taught in Latvian only. On 28 September 2023, Latvian deputies approved The National Security Concept, according to which from 1 January 2026, all content created by Latvian public media (including LSM) should be only in Latvian or a language that &quot;belongs to the European cultural space&quot;. The financing of Russian-language content by the state will cease, which the concept says create a &quot;unified information space&quot;. However, one inevitable consequence would be the closure of public media broadcasts in Russian on LTV and Latvian Radio, as well as the closure of LSM&#x27;s Russian-language service.

In Lithuania, Russian has no official or legal status, but the use of the language has some presence in certain areas. A large part of the population, especially the older generations, can speak Russian as a foreign language. However, English has replaced Russian as &quot;lingua franca&quot; in Lithuania and around 80% of young people speak English as their first foreign language. In contrast to the other two Baltic states, Lithuania has a relatively small Russian-speaking minority (5.0% as of 2008). According to the 2011 Lithuanian census, Russian was the native language for 7.2% of the population.

In Moldova, Russian was considered to be the language of interethnic communication under a Soviet-era law. On 21 January 2021, the Constitutional Court of Moldova declared the law unconstitutional and deprived Russian of the status of the language of interethnic communication. 50% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 19% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work. According to the 2014 Moldovan census, Russians accounted for 4.1% of Moldova&#x27;s population, 9.4% of the population declared Russian as their native language, and 14.5% said they usually spoke Russian.

According to the 2010 census in Russia, Russian language skills were indicated by 138 million people (99.4% of the respondents), while according to the 2002 census – 142.6 million people (99.2% of the respondents).

In Ukraine, Russian is a significant minority language. According to estimates from Demoskop Weekly, in 2004 there were 14,400,000 native speakers of Russian in the country, and 29 million active speakers. 65% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 38% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work. On 5 September 2017, Ukraine&#x27;s Parliament passed a new education law which requires all schools to teach at least partially in Ukrainian, with provisions while allow indigenous languages and languages of national minorities to be used alongside the national language. The law faced criticism from officials in Russia and Hungary. The 2019 Law of Ukraine &quot;On protecting the functioning of the Ukrainian language as the state language&quot; gives priority to the Ukrainian language in more than 30 spheres of public life: in particular in public administration, media, education, science, culture, advertising, services. The law does not regulate private communication. A poll conducted in March 2022 by RATING in the territory controlled by Ukraine found that 83% of the respondents believe that Ukrainian should be the only state language of Ukraine. This opinion dominates in all macro-regions, age and language groups. On the other hand, before the war, almost a quarter of Ukrainians were in favour of granting Russian the status of the state language, while after the beginning of Russia&#x27;s invasion the support for the idea dropped to just 7%. In peacetime, the idea of raising the status of Russian was traditionally supported by residents of the south and east. But even in these regions, only a third of the respondents were in favour, and after Russia&#x27;s full-scale invasion, their number dropped by almost half. According to the survey carried out by RATING in August 2023 in the territory controlled by Ukraine and among the refugees, almost 60% of the polled usually speak Ukrainian at home, about 30% – Ukrainian and Russian, only 9% – Russian. Since March 2022, the use of Russian in everyday life has been noticeably decreasing. For 82% of respondents, Ukrainian is their mother tongue, and for 16%, Russian is their mother tongue. IDPs and refugees living abroad are more likely to use both languages for communication or speak Russian. Nevertheless, more than 70% of IDPs and refugees consider Ukrainian to be their native language.

In the 20th century, Russian was a mandatory language taught in the schools of the members of the old Warsaw Pact and in other countries that used to be satellites of the USSR. According to the Eurobarometer 2005 survey, fluency in Russian remains fairly high (20–40%) in some countries, in particular former Warsaw Pact countries.

=== Caucasus ===
In Armenia, Russian has no official status, but it is recognized as a minority language under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. 30% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 2% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work.

In Azerbaijan, Russian has no official status, but is a &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the country. 26% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 5% used it as the main language with family, friends, or at work.

In Georgia, Russian has no official status, but it is recognized as a minority language under the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. Russian is the language of 9% of the population according to the World Factbook. Ethnologue cites Russian as the country&#x27;s de facto working language.

=== Asia ===
In China, Russian has no official status, but it is spoken by the small Russian communities in the northeastern Heilongjiang and the northwestern Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Russian was also the main foreign language taught in school in China between 1949 and 1964.

In Kazakhstan, Russian is not a state language, but according to article 7 of the Constitution of Kazakhstan its usage enjoys equal status to that of the Kazakh language in state and local administration. The 2009 census reported that 10,309,500 people, or 84.8% of the population aged 15 and above, could read and write well in Russian, and understand the spoken language. In October 2023, Kazakhstan drafted a media law aimed at increasing the use of the Kazakh language over Russian, the law stipulates that the share of the state language on television and radio should increase from 50% to 70%, at a rate of 5% per year, starting in 2025.

In Kyrgyzstan, Russian is a co-official language per article 5 of the Constitution of Kyrgyzstan. The 2009 census states that 482,200 people speak Russian as a native language, or 8.99% of the population. Additionally, 1,854,700 residents of Kyrgyzstan aged 15 and above fluently speak Russian as a second language, or 49.6% of the population in the age group.

In Tajikistan, Russian is the language of inter-ethnic communication under the Constitution of Tajikistan and is permitted in official documentation. 28% of the population was fluent in Russian in 2006, and 7% used it as the main language with family, friends or at work. The World Factbook notes that Russian is widely used in government and business.

In Turkmenistan, Russian lost its status as the official &quot;lingua franca&quot; in 1996. Among 12% of the population who grew up in the Soviet era can speak Russian, other generations of citizens that do not have any knowledge of Russian. Primary and secondary education by Russian is almost non-existent.

In Uzbekistan, Russian is the language of inter-ethnic communication. It has some official roles, being permitted in official documentation and is the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the country and the language of the elite. Russian is spoken by 14.2% of the population according to an undated estimate from the World Factbook.

In 2005, Russian was the most widely taught foreign language in Mongolia, and was compulsory in Year 7 onward as a second foreign language in 2006.

Around 1.5million Israelis spoke Russian as of 2017. The Israeli press and websites regularly publish material in Russian and there are Russian newspapers, television stations, schools, and social media outlets based in the country. There is an Israeli TV channel mainly broadcasting in Russian with Israel Plus. See also Russian language in Israel.

Russian is also spoken as a second language by a small number of people in Afghanistan.

In Vietnam, Russian has been added in the elementary curriculum along with Chinese and Japanese and were named as &quot;first foreign languages&quot; for Vietnamese students to learn, on equal footing with English.

=== North America ===

The Russian language was first introduced in North America when Russian explorers voyaged into Alaska and claimed it for Russia during the 18th century. Although most Russian colonists left after the United States bought the land in 1867, a handful stayed and preserved the Russian language in this region to this day, although only a few elderly speakers of this unique dialect are left. In Nikolaevsk, Alaska, Russian is more spoken than English. Sizable Russian-speaking communities also exist in North America, especially in large urban centers of the US and Canada, such as New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Los Angeles, Nashville, San Francisco, Seattle, Spokane, Toronto, Calgary, Baltimore, Miami, Portland, Chicago, Denver, and Cleveland. In a number of locations they issue their own newspapers, and live in ethnic enclaves (especially the generation of immigrants who started arriving in the early 1960s). Only about 25% of them are ethnic Russians, however. Before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the overwhelming majority of Russophones in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn in New York City were Russian-speaking Jews. Afterward, the influx from the countries of the former Soviet Union changed the statistics somewhat, with ethnic Russians and Ukrainians immigrating along with some more Russian Jews and Central Asians. According to the United States Census, in 2007 Russian was the primary language spoken in the homes of over 850,000 individuals living in the United States.

== As an international language ==

The Russian language is also one of two official languages aboard the International Space Station – NASA astronauts who serve alongside Russian cosmonauts usually take Russian language courses. This practice goes back to the Apollo–Soyuz mission, which first flew in 1975.

In March 2013, Russian was found to be the second-most used language on websites after English. Russian was the language of 5.9% of all websites, slightly ahead of German and far behind English (54.7%). Russian was used not only on 89.8% of .ru sites, but also on 88.7% of sites with the former Soviet Union domain .su. Websites in former Soviet Union member states also used high levels of Russian: 79.0% in Ukraine, 86.9% in Belarus, 84.0% in Kazakhstan, 79.6% in Uzbekistan, 75.9% in Kyrgyzstan and 81.8% in Tajikistan. However, Russian was the sixth-most used language on the top 1,000 sites, behind English, Chinese, French, German, and Japanese.

On 13 October 2023, the CIS Council of Heads of State signed the Treaty on the Establishment of the International Organisation for the Russian Language and adopted the Statement on Support and Promotion of the Russian Language as a Language of Interethnic Communication.

== Dialects ==

Despite leveling after 1900, especially in matters of vocabulary and phonetics, a number of dialects still exist in Russia. Some linguists divide the dialects of Russian into two primary regional groupings, &quot;Northern&quot; and &quot;Southern&quot;, with Moscow lying on the zone of transition between the two. Others divide the language into three groupings, Northern, Central (or Middle), and Southern, with Moscow lying in the Central region.

The Northern Russian dialects and those spoken along the Volga River typically pronounce unstressed clearly, a phenomenon called okanye (). Besides the absence of vowel reduction, some dialects have high or diphthongal in place of and in stressed closed syllables (as in Ukrainian) instead of Standard Russian and , respectively. Another Northern dialectal morphological feature is a post-posed definite article &quot;-to&quot;, &quot;-ta&quot;, &quot;-te&quot; similar to that existing in Bulgarian and Macedonian.

In the Southern Russian dialects, instances of unstressed and following palatalized consonants and preceding a stressed syllable are not reduced to (as occurs in the Moscow dialect), being instead pronounced in such positions (e.g. is pronounced , not ) – this is called yakanye (). Consonants include a fricative, a semivowel and , whereas the Standard and Northern dialects have the consonants , , and final and , respectively. The morphology features a palatalized final in 3rd person forms of verbs (this is unpalatalized in the Standard and Northern dialects).

== Comparison with other Slavic languages ==
During the Proto-Slavic (Common Slavic) times all Slavs spoke one mutually intelligible language or group of dialects. There is a high degree of mutual intelligibility between Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian, and a moderate degree of it in all modern Slavic languages, at least at the conversational level.

== Derived languages ==
* Balachka, a Ukrainian dialect spoken in Krasnodar region, Don, Kuban, and Terek, brought by relocated Cossacks in 1793 and is based on the so-called &quot;southwest Russian&quot; dialect (Ukrainian dialect). During the Russification of the aforementioned regions in the 1920s to 1950s, it was replaced by the Russian language.

== Alphabet ==


Russian is written using a Cyrillic alphabet. The Russian alphabet consists of 33 letters. The following table gives their forms, along with values for each letter&#x27;s typical sound:

Older letters of the Russian alphabet include , which merged to ( or ); and , which both merged to (); , which merged to (); , which merged to (); , which merged to ( or ); and and , which later were graphically reshaped into and merged phonetically to or . While these older letters have been abandoned at one time or another, they may be used in this and related articles. The yers and originally indicated the pronunciation of &quot;ultra-short&quot; or &quot;reduced&quot; , .

=== Transliteration ===
Because of many technical restrictions in computing and also because of the unavailability of Cyrillic keyboards abroad, Russian is often transliterated using the Latin alphabet. For example, (&#x27;frost&#x27;) is transliterated &quot;moroz&quot;, and (&#x27;mouse&#x27;), &quot;mysh&quot; or &quot;myš&quot;&#x27;. Once commonly used by the majority of those living outside Russia, transliteration is being used less frequently by Russian-speaking typists in favor of the extension of Unicode character encoding, which fully incorporates the Russian alphabet. Free programs are available offering this Unicode extension, which allow users to type Russian characters, even on Western &#x27;QWERTY&#x27; keyboards.

=== Computing ===

The Russian language was first introduced to computing after the M-1, and MESM models were produced in 1951.

=== Orthography ===
According to the Institute of Russian Language of the Russian Academy of Sciences, an optional acute accent () may, and sometimes should, be used to mark stress. For example, it is used to distinguish between otherwise identical words, especially when context does not make it obvious: (&quot;zamók&quot; – &quot;lock&quot;) – (&quot;zámok&quot; – &quot;castle&quot;), (&quot;stóyashchy&quot; – &quot;worthwhile&quot;) – (&quot;stoyáshchy&quot; – &quot;standing&quot;), (&quot;chudnó&quot; – &quot;this is odd&quot;) – (&quot;chúdno&quot; – &quot;this is marvellous&quot;), (&quot;molodéts&quot; – &quot;well done!&quot;) – (&quot;mólodets&quot; – &quot;fine young man&quot;), (&quot;uznáyu&quot; – &quot;I shall learn it&quot;) – (&quot;uznayú&quot; – &quot;I recognize it&quot;), (&quot;otrezát&quot; – &quot;to be cutting&quot;) – (&quot;otrézat&quot; – &quot;to have cut&quot;); to indicate the proper pronunciation of uncommon words, especially personal and family names, like (&quot;aféra&quot;, &quot;scandal, affair&quot;), (&quot;gúru&quot;, &quot;guru&quot;), (&quot;García&quot;), (&quot;Olésha&quot;), (&quot;Fermi&quot;), and to show which is the stressed word in a sentence, for example (&quot;Tý syel pechenye?&quot; – &quot;Was it &quot;you&quot; who ate the cookie?&quot;) – (&quot;Ty syél pechenye?&quot; – &quot;Did you &quot;eat&quot; the cookie?) – (&quot;Ty syel pechénye?&quot; &quot;Was it the &quot;cookie&quot; you ate?&quot;). Stress marks are mandatory in lexical dictionaries and books for children or Russian learners.

== Phonology ==
The Russian syllable structure can be quite complex, with both initial and final consonant clusters of up to four consecutive sounds. Using a formula with V standing for the nucleus (vowel) and C for each consonant, the maximal structure can be described as follows:

(C)(C)(C)(C)V(C)(C)(C)(C)

=== Consonants ===
Russian is notable for its distinction based on palatalization of most of its consonants. The phoneme // is generally considered to be always hard; however, loan words such as Цюрих and some other neologisms contain // through the word-building processes (e.g., фрицёнок [&quot;фриц&quot; plus diminutive &quot;ёнок&quot;], шпицята [&quot;шпиц&quot; plus diminutive &quot;ята&quot;]). Palatalization means that the center of the tongue is raised during and after the articulation of the consonant. In the case of and , the tongue is raised enough to produce slight frication (affricate sounds; cf. Belarusian ць, дзь, or Polish ć, dź). The sounds are dental, that is, pronounced with the tip of the tongue against the teeth rather than against the alveolar ridge. According to some linguists, the &quot;plain&quot; consonants are velarized as in Irish, something which is most noticeable when it involves a labial before a hard vowel, such as мы, , &quot;we&quot; , or бэ, , &quot;the letter Б&quot;.

=== Vowels ===


Russian has five or six vowels in stressed syllables, , and in some analyses , but in most cases these vowels have merged to only two to four vowels when unstressed: (or ) after hard consonants and after soft ones. These vowels have several allophones, which are displayed on the diagram to the right.

== Grammar ==


Russian has preserved an Indo-European synthetic-inflectional structure, although considerable leveling has occurred.
Russian grammar encompasses:

* a highly fusional morphology
* a syntax that, for the literary language, is the conscious fusion of three elements:
** a polished vernacular foundation;
** a Church Slavonic inheritance;
** a Western European style.

The spoken language has been influenced by the literary one but continues to preserve characteristic forms. The dialects show various non-standard grammatical features.

In terms of actual grammar, there are three tenses in Russian past, present, and future and each verb has two aspects (perfective and imperfective). Russian nouns each have a gender either feminine, masculine, or neuter, chiefly indicated by spelling at the end of the word. Words change depending on both their gender and function in the sentence. Russian has six cases: Nominative (for the grammatical subject), Accusative (for direct objects), Dative (for indirect objects), Genitive (to indicate possession or relation), Instrumental (to indicate &#x27;with&#x27; or &#x27;by means of&#x27;), and Prepositional (used after the locative prepositions в &quot;in&quot;, на &quot;on&quot;, о &quot;about&quot;, при &quot;in the presence of&quot;). Verbs of motion in Russian such as &#x27;go&#x27;, &#x27;walk&#x27;, &#x27;run&#x27;, &#x27;swim&#x27;, and &#x27;fly&#x27; use the imperfective or perfective form to indicate a single or return trip, and also use a multitude of prefixes to add shades of meaning to the verb. Such verbs also take on different forms to distinguish between concrete and abstract motion.

== Vocabulary ==
The number of listed words or entries in some of the major dictionaries published during the past two centuries, are as follows:

== History and literary language ==

No single periodization is universally accepted, but the history of the Russian language is sometimes divided into the following periods:
* Old Russian or Old East Slavic (until the 14th or 15th century)
* Middle Russian (14th or 15th century until the 17th or 18th century)
* Modern Russian (17th century or 18th century to the present)

The history of the Russian language is also divided into &quot;Old Russian&quot; from the 11th to 17th centuries, followed by &quot;Modern Russian&quot;.

The political reforms of Peter the Great (Пётр Вели́кий, &quot;Pyótr Velíky&quot;) were accompanied by a reform of the alphabet, and achieved their goal of secularization and Westernization. Blocks of specialized vocabulary were adopted from the languages of Western Europe. By 1800, a significant portion of the gentry spoke French daily, and German sometimes. Many Russian novels of the 19thcentury, e.g. Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s (Лев Толсто́й) &quot;War and Peace&quot;, contain entire paragraphs and even pages in French with no translation given, with an assumption that educated readers would not need one.

The modern literary language is usually considered to date from the time of Alexander Pushkin () in the first third of the 19thcentury. Pushkin revolutionized Russian literature by rejecting archaic grammar and vocabulary (so-called — &quot;high style&quot;) in favor of grammar and vocabulary found in the spoken language of the time. Even modern readers of younger age may only experience slight difficulties understanding some words in Pushkin&#x27;s texts, since relatively few words used by Pushkin have become archaic or changed meaning. In fact, many expressions used by Russian writers of the early 19thcentury, in particular Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov (), Nikolai Gogol (), Aleksander Griboyedov (), became proverbs or sayings which can be frequently found even in modern Russian colloquial speech.

During the Soviet period, the policy toward the languages of the various other ethnic groups fluctuated in practice. Though each of the constituent republics had its own official language, the unifying role and superior status was reserved for Russian, although it was declared the official language only in 1990. Following the break-up of the USSR in 1991, several of the newly independent states have encouraged their native languages, which has partly reversed the privileged status of Russian, though its role as the language of post-Soviet national discourse throughout the region has continued.

The Russian language in the world declined after 1991 due to the collapse of the Soviet Union and decrease in the number of Russians in the world and diminution of the total population in Russia (where Russian is an official language), however has since been reversed.

According to figures published in 2006 in the journal &quot;Demoskop Weekly&quot; research deputy director of Research Center for Sociological Research of the Ministry of Education and Science (Russia) Arefyev A. L., the Russian language is gradually losing its position in the world in general, and in Russia in particular. In 2012, A. L. Arefyev published a new study &quot;Russian language at the turn of the 20th–21st centuries&quot;, in which he confirmed his conclusion about the trend of weakening of the Russian language after the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse in various regions of the world (findings published in 2013 in the journal &quot;Demoskop Weekly&quot;). In the countries of the former Soviet Union the Russian language was being replaced or used in conjunction with local languages. Currently, the number of speakers of Russian in the world depends on the number of Russians in the world and total population in Russia.

== Sample text ==
Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in Russian:Все люди рождаются свободными и равными в своем достоинстве и правах. Они наделены разумом и совестью и должны поступать в отношении друг друга в духе братства.The romanization of the text into Latin alphabet:&quot;Vse lyudi rozhdayutsya svobodnymi i ravnymi v svoyem dostoinstve i pravakh. Oni nadeleny razumom i sovest&#x27;yu i dolzhny postupat&#x27; v otnoshenii drug druga v dukhe bratstva.&quot;Article 1 of the &quot;Universal Declaration of Human Rights&quot; in English:All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
