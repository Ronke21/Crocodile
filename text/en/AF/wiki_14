<text>Peter Sellers (born Richard Henry Sellers; 8 September 1925 – 24 July 1980) was an English actor and comedian. He first came to prominence performing in the BBC Radio comedy series &quot;The Goon Show&quot;. Sellers featured on a number of hit comic songs, and became known to a worldwide audience through his many film roles, among them Chief Inspector Clouseau in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; series.

Born in Southsea, Sellers made his stage debut at the Kings Theatre, Southsea, when he was two weeks old. He began accompanying his parents in a variety act that toured the provincial theatres. He first worked as a drummer and toured around England as a member of the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). He developed his mimicry and improvisational skills during a spell in Ralph Reader&#x27;s wartime Gang Show entertainment troupe, which toured Britain and the Far East. After the war, Sellers made his radio debut in &quot;ShowTime&quot;, and eventually became a regular performer on various BBC Radio shows. During the early 1950s, Sellers, along with Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Michael Bentine, took part in the successful radio series &quot;The Goon Show&quot;, which ended in 1960.

Sellers began his film career during the 1950s. Although the bulk of his work was comedic, often parodying characters of authority such as military officers or policemen, he also performed in other film genres and roles. Films demonstrating his artistic range include &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot; (1959), Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Lolita&quot; (1962) and &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964), &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot; (1965), &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967), &quot;The Party&quot; (1968), &quot;Being There&quot; (1979) and five films of the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; series (1963–1978). Sellers&#x27; versatility enabled him to portray a wide range of comic characters using different accents and guises, and he would often assume multiple roles within the same film, frequently with contrasting temperaments and styles. Satire and black humour were major features of many of his films, as they had been in his radio and record performances, and they had a strong influence on a number of later comedians. 

Sellers was nominated three times for an Academy Award, twice for the Academy Award for Best Actor, for his performances in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; and &quot;Being There&quot;, and once for the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film for &quot;The Running Jumping &amp; Standing Still Film&quot; (1959). He won the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for his role in &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot; and was nominated an additional three times for the previous two films and the satire &quot;Only Two Can Play&quot;. In 1980 he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role in &quot;Being There&quot;, having previously been nominated three times in the same category. Turner Classic Movies calls Sellers &quot;one of the most accomplished comic actors of the late 20th century&quot;.

In his personal life, Sellers struggled with depression and insecurities. An enigmatic figure, he often claimed to have no identity outside the roles that he played. His behaviour was often erratic and compulsive, and he frequently clashed with his directors and co-stars, especially in the mid-1970s, when his physical and mental health, together with his alcohol and drug problems, were at their worst. Sellers was married four times and had three children from his first two marriages. He died from a heart attack, aged 54, in 1980. English filmmakers the Boulting brothers described Sellers as &quot;the greatest comic genius this country has produced since Charles Chaplin&quot;.

== Biography ==

===1925–1939: Early life and career beginnings===
Sellers was born on 8 September 1925 in Southsea, a suburb of Portsmouth. His parents were Yorkshire-born William &quot;Bill&quot; Sellers and Agnes Doreen &quot;Peg&quot; (née Marks). Both were variety entertainers; Peg was in the Ray Sisters troupe. Although he was christened Richard Henry, his parents called him Peter, after his elder brother, who was stillborn. Sellers had no other siblings. Peg Sellers was related to the pugilist Daniel Mendoza (1764–1836), whom Sellers greatly revered and whose engraving later hung in his office. At one time Sellers planned to use Mendoza&#x27;s image for his production company&#x27;s logo.

Sellers was two weeks old when he was carried on stage by Dick Henderson, the headline act at the Kings Theatre in Southsea: the crowd sang &quot;For He&#x27;s a Jolly Good Fellow&quot;, which caused the infant to cry. The family constantly toured, causing much upheaval and unhappiness in the young Sellers&#x27; life.

Sellers maintained a very close relationship with his mother, which his friend Spike Milligan later considered unhealthy for a grown man. Sellers&#x27; agent, Dennis Selinger, recalled his first meeting with Peg and Peter Sellers, noting that &quot;Sellers was an immensely shy young man, inclined to be dominated by his mother, but without resentment or objection&quot;. As an only child, he spent much time alone.

In 1935 the Sellers family moved to North London and settled in Muswell Hill. Although Bill Sellers was Protestant and Peg was Jewish, Sellers attended the nearby Roman Catholic school St Aloysius&#x27; College in Highgate, run by the Brothers of Our Lady of Mercy. The family was not rich, but Peg insisted on an expensive private schooling for her son. According to biographer Peter Evans, Sellers was fascinated, puzzled, and worried by religion from a young age, particularly Catholicism; Roger Lewis believed that soon after entering Catholic school, Sellers &quot;discovered he was a Jew—he was someone on the outside of the mysteries of faith&quot;. Later in his life, Sellers observed that while his father&#x27;s faith was according to the Church of England, his mother was Jewish, &quot;and Jews take the faith of their mother.&quot; 

According to Milligan, Sellers felt a sense of guilt about being Jewish and recalls that Sellers was once reduced to tears when he presented him with a candlestick from a synagogue for Christmas, believing the gesture to be an anti-Jewish slur. Sellers became a top student at the school, excelling in drawing in particular. He was prone to laziness, but his natural talents shielded him from criticism by his teachers. Sellers recalled that a teacher scolded the other boys for not studying, saying: &quot;The Jewish boy knows his catechism better than the rest of you!&quot;

Accompanying his family on the variety show circuit, Sellers learned stagecraft, but received conflicting encouragement from his parents and developed mixed feelings about show business. His father doubted Sellers&#x27; abilities in the entertainment field, even suggesting that his son&#x27;s talents were only enough to become a road sweeper, while Sellers&#x27; mother encouraged him continuously. While at St Aloysius College, Sellers began to develop his improvisational skills. He and his closest friend at the time, Bryan Connon, both enjoyed listening to early radio comedy shows. Connon remembers that &quot;Peter got endless pleasure imitating the people in &quot;Monday Night at Eight&quot;. He had a gift for improvising dialogue. Sketches, too. I&#x27;d be the &#x27;straight man&#x27;, the &#x27;feed&#x27;, ... I&#x27;d cue Peter and he&#x27;d do all the radio personalities and chuck in a few voices of his own invention as well.&quot;

===1939–1945: War years===
With the outbreak of the Second World War, St Aloysius College was evacuated to Cambridgeshire. Because his mother did not allow Sellers to go, his formal education ended at fourteen. Early in 1940, the family moved to the north Devon town of Ilfracombe, where Sellers&#x27; maternal uncle managed the Victoria Palace Theatre; Sellers got his first job at the theatre, aged fifteen, starting as a caretaker. He was steadily promoted, becoming a box office clerk, usher, assistant stage manager and lighting operator. He was also offered some small acting parts. Working backstage gave him a chance to study actors such as Paul Scofield. He became close friends with Derek Altman, and together they launched Sellers&#x27; first stage act under the name &quot;Altman and Sellers&quot;, consisting of playing ukuleles, singing, and telling jokes.

During his backstage theatre job, Sellers began practising on a set of drums that belonged to the band Joe Daniels and his Hot Shots. Daniels noticed his efforts and gave him practical instructions. The instrument greatly suited Sellers&#x27; temperament and artistic skills. Spike Milligan later noted that Sellers was very proficient on the drums and might have remained a jazz drummer, had he lacked his skills in mimicry and improvisation. As the war progressed, Sellers continued to develop his drumming skills, and played with a series of touring bands, including those of Oscar Rabin, Henry Hall and Waldini, as well as his father&#x27;s quartet, before he left and joined a band from Blackpool. Sellers became a member of the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA), which provided entertainment for British forces and factory workers during the war. Sellers also performed comedy routines at these concerts, including impersonations of George Formby, with Sellers accompanying his own singing on ukulele.

In September 1943, he joined the Royal Air Force, although it is unclear whether he volunteered or was conscripted; his mother unsuccessfully tried to have him deferred on medical grounds. Sellers wanted to become a pilot, but his poor eyesight restricted him to ground staff duties. He found these duties dull, so auditioned for Squadron Leader Ralph Reader&#x27;s RAF &quot;Gang Show&quot; entertainment troupe: Reader accepted him and Sellers toured the UK before the troupe was transferred to India. His tour also included Ceylon and Burma, although the duration of his stay in Asia is unknown, and Sellers may have exaggerated its length. He also served in Germany and France after the war.
According to David Lodge, who became friends with Sellers, he was &quot;one of the best performers ever&quot; on the drums and developed a fine ability to impersonate military officers during this period.

===1946–1955: Early post-war work and &quot;The Goon Show&quot;===
In 1946, Sellers made his final show with ENSA starring in the pantomime &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot; at the Théâtre Marigny in Paris. He was posted back to England shortly afterwards to work at the Air Ministry, and demobilised later that year. On resuming his theatrical career, Sellers could get only sporadic work. He was dismissed after one performance of a comedy routine in Peterborough; the headline act, Welsh vocalist Dorothy Squires, however, persuaded the management to reinstate him. Sellers also continued his drumming and was billed on his appearance at The Hippodrome in Aldershot as &quot;Britain&#x27;s answer to Gene Krupa&quot;. In March 1948 Sellers gained a six-week run at the Windmill Theatre in London, which predominantly staged revue acts: he provided the comedy turns in between the nude shows on offer.

Sellers wrote to the BBC in 1948, and was subsequently auditioned. As a result, he made his television debut on 18 March 1948 in &quot;New To You&quot;. His act, largely based on impressions, was well received, and he returned the following week. Frustrated with the slow pace of his career, Sellers telephoned BBC radio producer Roy Speer, pretending to be Kenneth Horne, star of the radio show &quot;Much-Binding-in-the-Marsh&quot;. Speer called Sellers a &quot;cheeky young sod&quot; for his efforts, but gave him an audition. This led to his brief appearance on 1 July 1948 on &quot;ShowTime&quot; and subsequently to work on &quot;Ray&#x27;s a Laugh&quot; with comedian Ted Ray. In October 1948, Sellers was a regular radio performer, appearing in &quot;Starlight Hour&quot;, &quot;The Gang Show&quot;, &quot;Henry Hall&#x27;s Guest Night&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Fine To Be Young&quot;.

By the end of 1948, the BBC Third Programme began to broadcast the comedy series &quot;Third Division&quot;, which starred, among others, Harry Secombe, Michael Bentine and Sellers. One evening, Sellers and Bentine visited the Hackney Empire, where Secombe was performing, and Bentine introduced Sellers to Spike Milligan. The four would meet up at Grafton&#x27;s public house near Victoria, owned by Jimmy Grafton, who was also a BBC script writer. The four comedians dubbed him &quot;KOGVOS&quot; (Keeper of Goons and Voice of Sanity) Grafton later edited some of the first &quot;Goon Shows&quot;.

In 1949, Sellers started to date Anne Howe, an Australian actress who lived in London. He proposed to her in April 1950 and the couple were married in London on 15 September 1951; their son, Michael, was born on 2 April 1954, and their daughter, Sarah, followed in 1958. Sellers&#x27; introduction to film work came in 1950, where he dubbed the voice of Alfonso Bedoya in &quot;The Black Rose&quot;. He continued to work with Bentine, Milligan, and Secombe. On 3 February 1951, they made a trial tape entitled &quot;The Goons&quot;, and sent it to the BBC producer Pat Dixon, who eventually accepted it. The first &quot;Goon Show&quot; was broadcast on 28 May 1951. Against their wishes, they appeared under the name &quot;Crazy People&quot;. 

Sellers appeared until the last programme of the ten-series run, broadcast on 28 January 1960. Sellers played four main characters—Major Bloodnok, Hercules Grytpype-Thynne, Bluebottle and Henry Crun—and seventeen minor ones. Starting with 370,000 listeners, the show eventually reached up to seven million people in Britain, and was described by one newspaper as &quot;probably the most influential comedy show of all time&quot;. For Sellers, the BBC considers it had the effect of launching his career &quot;on the road to stardom&quot;.

In 1951 the Goons made their feature film debut in &quot;Penny Points to Paradise&quot;. Sellers and Milligan then penned the script to &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Crazy&quot;, the earliest film to showcase Sellers&#x27; ability to portray a series of different characters within the same film, and he made another appearance opposite his Goons co-stars in the 1952 flop, &quot;Down Among the Z Men&quot;. In 1954, Sellers was cast opposite Sid James, Tony Hancock, Raymond Huntley, Donald Pleasence and Eric Sykes in the British Lion Film Corporation comedy production, &quot;Orders Are Orders&quot;. John Grierson believes that this was Sellers&#x27; breakthrough role on screen and credits this film with launching the film careers of both Sellers and Hancock.

===1956–1959: &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot; and early films===

Sellers pursued a film career and took a number of small roles such as a police officer in &quot;John and Julie&quot; (1955). He accepted a larger part in the 1955 Alexander Mackendrick-directed Ealing comedy &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; in which he starred opposite his idol Alec Guinness, in addition to Herbert Lom and Cecil Parker. Sellers portrayed Harry Robinson, the Teddy Boy; biographer Peter Evans considers this Sellers&#x27; first good role. &quot;The Ladykillers&quot; was a success in both the UK and the US, and the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The following year Sellers appeared in a further three television series based on &quot;The Goons&quot;: &quot;The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d&quot;; &quot;A Show Called Fred&quot;; and &quot;Son of Fred&quot;. The shows aired on Britain&#x27;s new ITV channel. 

In 1957 film producer Michael Relph, impressed with Sellers&#x27; portrayal of an elderly character in &quot;Idiot Weekly&quot;, cast the 32-year-old actor as a 68-year-old projectionist in Basil Dearden&#x27;s &quot;The Smallest Show on Earth&quot;, supporting Bill Travers, Virginia McKenna and Margaret Rutherford. The film was a commercial success and is now thought of as a minor classic of post-war British screen comedy. Following this, Sellers provided the growling voice of Winston Churchill to the BAFTA award-winning film &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot;. Later in 1957 Sellers portrayed a television star with a talent for disguises in Mario Zampi&#x27;s offbeat black comedy &quot;The Naked Truth&quot;, opposite Terry-Thomas, Peggy Mount, Shirley Eaton and Dennis Price.

Sellers&#x27; difficulties in getting his film career to take off and increasing problems in his personal life prompted him to seek periodic consultations with astrologer Maurice Woodruff, who held considerable sway over his later career. After a chance meeting with a North American Indian spirit guide in the 1950s Sellers became convinced that the music hall comedian Dan Leno, who had died in 1904, haunted him and guided his career and life-decisions. Sellers was a member of the Grand Order of Water Rats, the exclusive theatrical fraternity founded by Leno in 1890. In 1958 Sellers starred with David Tomlinson, Wilfrid Hyde-White, David Lodge and Lionel Jeffries as a chief petty officer in Val Guest&#x27;s &quot;Up the Creek&quot;. 

Guest later claimed that he had written and directed the film as a vehicle for Sellers and thus had started Sellers&#x27; film career. To practise his voice, Sellers purchased a reel-to-reel tape recorder. The film received critical acclaim in the United States and Roger Lewis viewed it as an important practice ground for Sellers. Next, Sellers featured with Terry-Thomas as one of a pair of comic villains in George Pal&#x27;s &quot;Tom Thumb&quot; (1958), a musical fantasy film, opposite Russ Tamblyn, Jessie Matthews and Peter Butterworth. Terry-Thomas later said that &quot;my part was perfect, but Peter&#x27;s was bloody awful. He wasn&#x27;t difficult about it, but he knew it&quot;. The performance was a landmark in Sellers&#x27; career and became his first contact with the Hollywood film industry.

Sellers released his first studio album in 1958 called &quot;The Best of Sellers&quot;; a collection of comic songs and sketches, among them Balham - Gateway to the South, where Sellers plays a variety of comic characters. Produced by George Martin and released on Parlophone, the album reached number three in the UK Albums Chart; The same year, Sellers made his first film with John and Roy Boulting in &quot;Carlton-Browne of the F.O.&quot;, a comedy in which he played a supporting role for the film&#x27;s lead, Terry-Thomas. Before the release of that film, the Boultings, along with Sellers and Thomas in the cast, started filming &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot;, which became the highest-grossing film at the British box office in 1960. In preparation for his role as Fred Kite, Sellers watched footage of union officials. The role earned him a BAFTA, and the critic for &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; believed it was Sellers&#x27; best screen performance to date. In between &quot;Carlton-Browne of the F.O.&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot;, Sellers starred in &quot;The Mouse That Roared&quot;, a film in which Jean Seberg also appeared, and was directed by Jack Arnold. He played three distinct leading roles: the elderly Grand Duchess, the ambitious Prime Minister and the innocent and clumsy farm boy selected to lead an invasion of the United States. The film received high praise from critics.

After completing &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot;, Sellers returned to record a new series of &quot;The Goon Show&quot;. Over the course of two weekends, he took his 16mm cine-camera to Totteridge Lane in London and filmed himself, Spike Milligan, Mario Fabrizi, Leo McKern and Richard Lester. Originally intended as a private film, the eleven-minute short film &quot;The Running Jumping &amp; Standing Still Film&quot; was screened at the 1959 Edinburgh and San Francisco film festivals. It won the award for best fiction short in the latter festival, and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Short Subject (Live Action). In 1959 Sellers released his second album, &quot;Songs for Swingin&#x27; Sellers&quot;, which—like his first record—reached number three in the UK Albums Chart. Sellers&#x27; last film of the fifties was &quot;The Battle of the Sexes&quot;, a comedy directed by Charles Crichton.

===1960–1963: &quot;The Millionairess&quot;, &quot;Lolita&quot;, &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; and divorce===
In 1960, Sellers portrayed an Indian doctor, Dr Ahmed el Kabir, in Anthony Asquith&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;The Millionairess&quot;, a film based on a George Bernard Shaw play of the same name. Sellers was not interested in the role until he learned that Sophia Loren would be his co-star. When asked about Loren, he explained to reporters, &quot;I don&#x27;t normally act with romantic, glamorous women ... She&#x27;s a lot different from Harry Secombe.&quot; Sellers and Loren developed a close relationship during filming, culminating in Sellers declaring his love for her in front of his wife. Sellers also woke his son at night to ask, &quot;Do you think I should divorce your mummy?&quot; There is uncertainty if the relationship was anything more than platonic: a number of people, including Spike Milligan, consider it an affair, while others, including Graham Stark, think it remained only a strong friendship. Sellers&#x27; wife at the time, Anne, afterwards commented, &quot;I don&#x27;t know to this day whether he had an affair with her. Nobody does.&quot; 

Roger Lewis observed that Sellers immersed himself completely in the characters he enacted during productions, that &quot;He&#x27;d play a role as an Indian doctor, and for the next six months, he&#x27;d be an Indian in his real [daily] life.&quot; The film inspired the George Martin-produced novelty hit single &quot;Goodness Gracious Me&quot;, with Sellers and Loren, which reached number four in the UK Singles Chart in November 1960. A follow-up single by the duo, &quot;Bangers and Mash&quot;, reached number 22 in the UK chart. The songs were included on an album released by the couple, &quot;Peter &amp; Sophia&quot;, which reached number five in the UK Albums Chart. That year he also appeared in &quot;Never Let Go&quot; (1960) playing a straight villain part.

In 1961, Sellers made his directorial debut with &quot;Mr. Topaze&quot;, in which he also starred. The film was based on the Marcel Pagnol play &quot;Topaze&quot;. Sellers portrayed an ex-schoolmaster in a small French town who turns to a life of crime to obtain wealth. The film and Sellers&#x27; directorial abilities received unenthusiastic responses from the public and critics, and Sellers rarely referred to it again. The same year, he starred in the Sidney Gilliat-directed &quot;Only Two Can Play&quot;, a film based on the novel &quot;That Uncertain Feeling&quot; by Kingsley Amis. He was nominated for the Best British Actor award at the 16th British Academy Film Awards for his role as John Lewis, a frustrated Welsh librarian whose affections swing between the glamorous Liz (Mai Zetterling) and his long-suffering wife Jean (Virginia Maskell).

In 1962, Sellers played a retired British army general in John Guillermin&#x27;s &quot;Waltz of the Toreadors&quot;, based on the play of the same name. The film was widely criticised for its slapstick cinematic adaption, and director Guillermin himself considered the film &quot;amateurish&quot;. However, Sellers won the San Sebastián International Film Festival Award for Best Actor and a BAFTA award nomination for his performance, and it was well received by the critics. Stanley Kubrick asked Sellers to play the role of Clare Quilty in the 1962 film &quot;Lolita&quot;, opposite James Mason and Shelley Winters. Kubrick had seen Sellers in &quot;The Battle of the Sexes&quot; and listened to the album &quot;The Best of Sellers&quot;, and was impressed by the range of characters he could portray. 

Sellers was apprehensive about accepting the role, doubting his ability to successfully portray the part of a flamboyant American television playwright who was, according to Sellers, &quot;a fantastic nightmare, part homosexual, part drug addict, part sadist&quot;. Kubrick encouraged Sellers to improvise and stated that he often reached a &quot;state of comic ecstasy&quot;. Kubrick had American jazz producer Norman Granz record portions of the script for Sellers to listen to, so he could study the voice and develop confidence, granting Sellers a free artistic licence. Sellers later claimed that his relationship with Kubrick became one of the most rewarding of his career. Writing in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, Dilys Powell commented that Sellers gave &quot;a firework performance, funny, malicious, only once for a few seconds overreaching itself, and in the murder scene which is both prologue and epilogue achieving the macabre in comedy.&quot; 

Towards the end of 1962, Sellers appeared in &quot;The Dock Brief&quot;, a legal satire directed by James Hill and co-starring Richard Attenborough.

Sellers&#x27; behaviour towards his family worsened in 1962; according to his son Michael, Sellers asked him and his sister Sarah &quot;who we love more, our mother or him. Sarah, to keep the peace, said, &#x27;I love you both equally&#x27;. I said, &#x27;No, I love my mum.&#x27;&quot; This prompted Sellers to throw both children out, saying that he never wanted to see them again. At the end of 1962, his marriage to Anne broke down. In 1963, Sellers starred as gang leader &quot;Pearly Gates&quot; in Cliff Owen&#x27;s &quot;The Wrong Arm of the Law&quot;, followed by his portrayal of a vicar in &quot;Heavens Above!&quot;

After his father&#x27;s death in October 1962, Sellers decided to leave England and was approached by director Blake Edwards who offered him the role of Inspector Clouseau in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, after Peter Ustinov had backed out of the film. Edwards later recalled his feelings as &quot;desperately unhappy and ready to kill, but as fate would have it, I got Mr. Sellers instead of Mr. Ustinov—thank God!&quot; Sellers accepted a fee of £90,000 (£ in pounds) for five weeks&#x27; work on location in Rome and Cortina. The film starred David Niven in the principal role, with two other actors—Capucine and Claudia Cardinale—having more prominent roles than Sellers. However, Sellers&#x27; performance is regarded as being on par with that of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, according to biographer Peter Evans. Although the Clouseau character was in the script, Sellers created the personality, devising the costume, accent, make-up, moustache and trench coat.

&quot;The Pink Panther&quot; was released in the UK in January 1964 and received a mixed reception from the critics, although Penelope Gilliatt, writing in &quot;The Observer&quot;, remarked that Sellers had a &quot;flawless sense of mistiming&quot; in a performance that was &quot;one of the most delicate studies in accident-proneness since the silents&quot;. Despite the views of the critics, the film was one of the top ten grossing films of the year. The role earned Sellers a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the 22nd Golden Globe Awards, and for a Best British Actor award at the 18th British Academy Film Awards.

===1964–1969: &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, health problems, second marriage and &quot;Casino Royale&quot;===

In 1963, Stanley Kubrick cast Sellers to appear in &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot; alongside George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn and Slim Pickens. Sellers and Kubrick got along famously during the film&#x27;s production and had the greatest of respect for each other, also sharing a love of photography. The director asked Sellers to play four roles: US President Merkin Muffley, Dr. Strangelove, US Air Force Major T. J. &quot;King&quot; Kong, and Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF. Sellers was initially hesitant about taking on these divergent characters, but Kubrick prevailed. According to some accounts, Sellers was also invited to play the part of General Buck Turgidson, but turned it down because it was too physically demanding. Kubrick later commented that the idea of having Sellers in so many of the film&#x27;s key roles was that &quot;everywhere you turn there is some version of Peter Sellers holding the fate of the world in his hands&quot;. Sellers was especially anxious about believably portraying Kong; he was unsure of his ability to speak in a Texan accent. Kubrick requested screenwriter Terry Southern to record in his natural accent a tape of Kong&#x27;s lines. After practising with Southern&#x27;s recording, Sellers got sufficient control of the accent, and started shooting the scenes in the aeroplane.

After the first day&#x27;s shooting, Sellers sprained his ankle while leaving a restaurant and could no longer work in the cramped cockpit set. Kubrick then re-cast Slim Pickens as Kong. The three roles Sellers undertook were distinct, &quot;variegated, complex and refined&quot;, and critic Alexander Walker considered that these roles &quot;showed his genius at full stretch&quot;. Sellers played Muffley as a bland, placid intellectual in the mould of Adlai Stevenson; he played Mandrake as an unflappable Englishman; and Dr. Strangelove, a character influenced by pre-war German cinema, as a wheelchair-using fanatic. The critic for &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that the film includes, &quot;three remarkable performances from Mr. Peter Sellers, masterly as the President, diverting as a revue-sketch ex-Nazi US Scientist ... and acceptable as an RAF officer,&quot; although the critic from &quot;The Guardian&quot; thought his portrayal of the RAF officer alone was, &quot;worth the price of an admission ticket&quot;. For his performance in all three roles, Sellers was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor at the 37th Academy Awards, and the Best British Actor award at the 18th British Academy Film Awards.

Between November 1963 and February 1964, Sellers began filming &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot;, an adaptation of a French play, &quot;L&#x27;Idiote&quot; by Marcel Achard. Sellers found the part and the director, Anatole Litvak, uninspiring; the producers brought in Blake Edwards to replace Litvak. Together with writer William Peter Blatty, they turned the script into a Clouseau comedy, also adding Herbert Lom as Commissioner Dreyfus and Burt Kwouk as Cato. During filming, Sellers&#x27; relationship with Edwards became strained; the two would often stop speaking to each other during filming, communicating only by the passing of notes. Sellers&#x27; personality was described by others as difficult and demanding, and he often clashed with fellow actors and directors. Upon its release in late June 1964, Bosley Crowther noted the &quot;joyously free and facile way&quot; in which Sellers had developed his comedy technique.

Towards the end of filming, in early February 1964, Sellers met Britt Ekland, a Swedish actress who had arrived in London to film &quot;Guns at Batasi&quot;. On 19 February 1964, just ten days after their first meeting, the couple married. Sellers soon showed signs of insecurity and paranoia; he would become highly anxious and jealous, for example, when Ekland starred opposite attractive men. Shortly after the wedding, Sellers started filming on location in Twentynine Palms, California, for Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Kiss Me, Stupid&quot;, opposite Dean Martin and Kim Novak. The relationship between Wilder and Sellers became strained; both had different approaches to work and often clashed as a result. On the night of 5 April 1964, prior to having sex with Ekland, Sellers inhaled amyl nitrite (poppers) as a sexual stimulant in his search for &quot;the ultimate orgasm&quot;, and suffered a series of eight heart attacks over the course of three hours as a result. His illness forced him to withdraw from the filming of &quot;Kiss Me, Stupid&quot; and he was replaced by Ray Walston. Wilder was unsympathetic about the heart attacks, saying that &quot;you have to have a heart before you can have an attack&quot;.

After some time recovering, Sellers returned to filming in October 1964, playing King of the Individualists alongside Ekland in &quot;A Carol for Another Christmas&quot;, a feature-length United Nations special broadcast in the United States on the ABC channel on 28 December 1964. Sellers had been concerned that his heart attacks might have caused brain damage and that he would be unable to remember his lines, but he was reassured that his memory and abilities were unimpaired after the experience of filming. Sellers followed this with the role of the perverted Austrian psychoanalyst Doctor Fritz Fassbender in Clive Donner&#x27;s &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot;, appearing alongside Peter O&#x27;Toole, Romy Schneider, Capucine, Paula Prentiss and Ursula Andress. The film was the first screenwriting and acting credit for Woody Allen, and featured Sellers in a love triangle. Because of Sellers&#x27; poor health, producer Charles K. Feldman insured him at a cost of $360,000 ($ in dollars).
On 20 January 1965, Sellers and Ekland announced the birth of a daughter, Victoria. They moved to Rome in May to film &quot;After the Fox&quot;, an Anglo-Italian production in which they were both to appear. The film was directed by Vittorio De Sica, whose English Sellers struggled to understand. Sellers attempted to have De Sica fired, causing tensions on the set. Sellers also became unhappy with his wife&#x27;s performance, straining their relationship and triggering open arguments during one of which Sellers threw a chair at Ekland. Despite these conflicts, the script was praised for its wit.

Following the commercial success of &quot;What&#x27;s New Pussycat?&quot;, Charles Feldman again brought together Sellers and Woody Allen for his next project, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, which also starred Orson Welles; Sellers signed a $1 million contract for the film ($ in dollars). Seven screenwriters worked on the project, and filming was chaotic. To make matters worse, according to Ekland, Sellers was &quot;so insecure, he won&#x27;t trust anyone&quot;. A poor working relationship quickly developed between Sellers and Welles: Sellers eventually demanded that the two should not share the same set. Sellers left the film before his part was complete. A further agent&#x27;s part was then written for Terence Cooper, to cover Sellers&#x27; departure.

Shortly after leaving &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, Sellers was appointed a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in honour of his career achievements. The day before the investiture at Buckingham Palace, Sellers and Ekland argued, with Ekland scratching his face in the process; Sellers had a make-up artist cover the marks. During his next film, &quot;The Bobo&quot;, which again co-starred Ekland, the couple&#x27;s marital problems worsened. Three weeks into production in Italy, Sellers told director Robert Parrish to fire his wife, saying &quot;I&#x27;m not coming back after lunch if that bitch is on the set&quot;. Ekland later stated that the marriage was &quot;an atrocious sham&quot; at this stage. In the midst of filming &quot;The Bobo&quot;, Sellers&#x27; mother had a heart attack; Parrish asked Sellers if he wanted to visit her in hospital, but Sellers remained on set. She died within days, without Sellers having seen her. He was deeply affected by her death and remorseful at not having returned to London to see her. Ekland served him with divorce papers shortly afterwards. The divorce was finalised on 18 December 1968, and Sellers&#x27; friend Spike Milligan sent Ekland a congratulatory telegram. Upon its release in September 1967, &quot;The Bobo&quot; was poorly received.

Sellers&#x27; first film appearance of 1968 was a reunion with Blake Edwards for the comedy &quot;The Party&quot;, in which he starred alongside Claudine Longet and Denny Miller. He appears as Hrundi V. Bakshi, a bungling Indian actor who accidentally receives an invitation to a lavish Hollywood dinner party. His character, according to Sellers&#x27; biographer Peter Evans, was &quot;clearly an amalgam of Clouseau and the doctor in &quot;The Millionairess&quot;&quot;. Roger Lewis notes that like a number of Sellers&#x27; characters, he is played in a sympathetic and dignified manner. He followed it later that year with Hy Averback&#x27;s &quot;I Love You, Alice B. Toklas&quot;, playing an attorney who abandons his lifestyle to become a hippie. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars, remarking that Sellers was &quot;back doing what he does best&quot;, although he also said that in Sellers&#x27; previous films he had &quot;been at his worst recently&quot;.

In 1969, Sellers starred opposite Ringo Starr in the Joseph McGrath-directed film &quot;The Magic Christian&quot;. Sellers portrayed Sir Guy Grand, an eccentric billionaire who plays elaborate practical jokes on people. The critic Irv Slifkin remarked that the film was a reflection of the cynicism of Peter Sellers, describing the film as a &quot;proto-Pythonesque adaption of Terry Southern&#x27;s semi-free-form short novel&quot;, and &quot;one of the strangest films to be shown at a gala premiere for Britain&#x27;s royal family&quot;. The film, a satire on human nature, was in general viewed negatively by critics. Roger Greenspun of &quot;The New York Times&quot; believed that the film was of variable quality and summarised it as a &quot;brutal satire&quot;.

===1970–1978: &quot;Period of indifference&quot;: two marriages, three &quot;Pink Panther&quot; films===
After a cameo appearance in &quot;A Day at the Beach&quot; (1970), and a serious role later in 1970 as an ageing businessman who seduces Sinéad Cusack in &quot;Hoffman&quot;, Sellers starred in Roy Boulting&#x27;s &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in My Soup&quot; opposite Goldie Hawn. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, the film was a major commercial success and became the seventh most popular film at the British box office in 1970. Andrew Spicer, writing for the British Film Institute&#x27;s Screenonline, considers that although Sellers favoured playing romantic roles, he &quot;was always more successful in parts that sent up his own vanities and pretensions, as with the TV presenter and narcissistic lothario&quot; he played in &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in My Soup&quot;. The film was seen as a small revival of his career.

Sellers&#x27; next films, including Rodney Amateau&#x27;s &quot;Where Does It Hurt?&quot; (1972) and Peter Medak&#x27;s &quot;Ghost in the Noonday Sun&quot; (1974), were again poorly received, and his acting was viewed as frenetic rather than funny. Despite these setbacks, Sellers won the Best Actor award at the 1973 Tehran Film Festival for his tragi-comedic role as a street performer in Anthony Simmons&#x27;s &quot;The Optimists of Nine Elms&quot;. Fellow comedian and friend Spike Milligan believed that the early 1970s were for Sellers &quot;a period of indifference, and it would appear at one time that his career might have come to a conclusion&quot;. This was echoed by Sellers&#x27; biographer, Peter Evans, who notes that out of nine films in the period, three were never released and five had flopped, while only &quot;There&#x27;s a Girl in My Soup&quot; had been a success. In his private life, he had been seeing the 23-year-old model Miranda Quarry. The couple married on 24 August 1970, despite Sellers&#x27; private doubts—expressed to his agent, Dennis Selinger—about his decision to remarry.

In April 1972, Sellers reunited with Milligan and Harry Secombe to record &quot;The Last Goon Show of All&quot;, which was broadcast on 5 October. In May 1973, with his third marriage failing, Sellers went to the theatre to watch Liza Minnelli perform. He became entranced with Minnelli and the couple became engaged three days later, despite Minnelli&#x27;s then-current betrothal to Desi Arnaz Jr., and Sellers still being married. Their relationship lasted a month before breaking up. By 1974, Sellers&#x27; friends were concerned that he was having a nervous breakdown. Directors John and Roy Boulting considered that Sellers was &quot;a deeply troubled man, distrustful, self-absorbed, ultimately self-destructive. He was the complete contradiction.&quot; Sellers was shy and insecure when out of character. When he was invited to appear on Michael Parkinson&#x27;s eponymous chat show in 1974, he withdrew the day before, explaining to Parkinson that &quot;I just can&#x27;t walk on as myself&quot;. When he was told he could come on as someone else, he appeared dressed as a member of the Gestapo. After a few lines in keeping with his assumed character, he stepped out of the role and settled down and, according to Parkinson himself, &quot;was brilliant, giving the audience an astonishing display of his virtuosity&quot;. In 1974, Sellers again claimed to have communicated with the long-dead music hall comic Dan Leno, who advised him to return to the role of Clouseau.

In 1974, Sellers portrayed a &quot;sexually voracious&quot; Queen Victoria in Joseph McGrath&#x27;s comedic biographical film of the Scottish poet William McGonagall, &quot;The Great McGonagall&quot;, starring opposite Milligan and Julia Foster. However, the film was a critical failure, and Sellers&#x27; career and life reached an all-time low. As a result, by 1974 he agreed to accept salaries of £100,000 and 10 per cent of the gross to appear in TV productions and advertisements, well below the £1 million he had once commanded per film. In 1973, he appeared in a Benson &amp; Hedges cinema commercial; in 1975, he appeared in a series of advertisements for Trans World Airlines, in which he played several eccentric characters, including Thrifty McTravel, Jeremy &quot;Piggy&quot; Peak Thyme and an Italian singer, Vito. Biographer Michael Starr asserts that Sellers showed enthusiasm towards these roles, although the airline campaign failed commercially.

The turning point in Sellers&#x27; flailing career came in 1974, when he re-teamed with Blake Edwards to star in &quot;The Return of the Pink Panther&quot;, alongside Christopher Plummer, Herbert Lom and Catherine Schell. The film was shot on a budget of $3.7 million and earned $33 million at the box office upon release in May 1975, restoring Sellers&#x27; career as an A-list film star along with his millionaire status. The film earned Sellers a nomination for the Best Actor – Musical or Comedy award at the 33rd Golden Globe Awards. In 1976, Sellers and Edwards followed it with &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot;. During the filming from February to June 1976, the already fraught relationship between Sellers and Blake Edwards had deteriorated even further. Edwards says of the actor&#x27;s mental state at the time of &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot;, &quot;If you went to an asylum and you described the first inmate you saw, that&#x27;s what Peter had become. He was certifiable.&quot; With declining physical health, Sellers could at times be unbearable on set. His behaviour was regarded as unprofessional and childish, and he frequently threw tantrums, often threatening to abandon projects. His difficult behaviour during productions was widely reported and made it more difficult for Sellers to get employment in the industry at a time when he most needed the work. Despite Sellers&#x27; deep personal problems, &quot;The Pink Panther Strikes Again&quot; was well received critically. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of Sellers in the film, &quot;There is, too, something most winningly seedy about Mr. Sellers&#x27; Clouseau, a fellow who, when he attempts to tear off his clothes in the heat of passion, gets tangled up in his necktie, and who, when he masquerades—for reasons never gone into—as Quasimodo, overinflates his hump with helium.&quot; Sellers&#x27; performance earned him a further nomination at the 34th Golden Globe Awards.

In March 1976, Sellers began dating actress Lynne Frederick, whom he married on 18 February 1977. Biographer Roger Lewis documents that of Sellers&#x27; four wives, Frederick was the most poorly treated; Julian Upton likened it to a boxing match between a heavyweight and a featherweight, a relationship that &quot;oscillated from ardour to hatred, reconciliation and remorse&quot;. On 20 March 1977, Sellers suffered a second major heart attack during a flight from Paris to London; he was subsequently fitted with a pacemaker. Sellers returned from his illness to undertake &quot;Revenge of the Pink Panther&quot;; although it was a commercial success, the critics were tiring of Inspector Clouseau. Julian Upton expressed the view that the strain behind the scenes began to manifest itself in the sluggish pace of the film, describing it as a &quot;laboured, stunt-heavy hotchpotch of half-baked ideas and rehashed gags&quot;. Sellers too had become tired of the role, saying after production, &quot;I&#x27;ve honestly had enough of Clouseau—I&#x27;ve got nothing more to give&quot;. Steven Bach, the senior vice-president and head of worldwide productions for United Artists, who worked with Sellers on &quot;Revenge of the Pink Panther&quot;, considered that Sellers was &quot;deeply unbalanced, if not committable: that was the source of his genius and his truly quite terrifying aspects as manipulator and hysteric.&quot; He refused to seek professional help for his mental issues. Sellers would claim that he had no personality and was almost unnoticeable, which meant that he &quot;needed a strongly defined character to play&quot;. He would make similar references throughout his life: when he appeared on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in 1978, a guest appearance that earned him an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Continuing or Single Performance by a Supporting Actor in Variety or Music, he chose not to appear as himself, instead appearing as a variety of characters in several costumes and speaking in different accents. When Kermit the Frog told Sellers he could relax and just be himself, Sellers replied:
===1979–1980: &quot;Being There&quot;, &quot;Fu Manchu&quot;, and continued domestic problems===
In 1979, Sellers starred alongside Lynne Frederick, Lionel Jeffries and Elke Sommer in Richard Quine&#x27;s &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;. He portrayed three roles, including King Rudolf IV and King Rudolf V—rulers of the fictional small nation of Ruritania—and Syd Frewin, Rudolf V&#x27;s half-brother. Upon its release in May 1979, the film was well received; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed how Sellers divided &quot;his energies between a serious character and a funny one, but that it was his serious performance which was more impressive&quot;. However, Philip French, for &quot;The Observer&quot;, was unimpressed by the film, describing it as &quot;a mess of porridge&quot; and stating that &quot;Sellers reveals that he cannot draw the line between the sincere and the sentimental&quot;.

Later in 1979, Sellers starred opposite Shirley MacLaine, Melvyn Douglas and Jack Warden in the black comedy &quot;Being There&quot; as Chance, a simple-minded gardener addicted to watching TV who is regarded as a sage by the rich and powerful. In a BBC interview in 1971, Sellers had said that more than anything else, he wanted to play the role, and successfully persuaded the author of the book, Jerzy Kosinski, to allow him and director Hal Ashby to make the film, provided Kosinski could write the script. During filming, to remain in character, Sellers refused most interview requests and kept his distance from the other actors. Sellers considered Chance&#x27;s walking and voice the character&#x27;s most important attributes, and in preparing for the role worked alone with a tape recorder or with his wife, and then with Ashby, to perfect the clear enunciation and flat delivery needed to reveal &quot;the childlike mind behind the words&quot;. Sellers described his experience of working on the film as &quot;so humbling, so powerful&quot;, and co-star Shirley MacLaine found Sellers &quot;a dream&quot; to work with. Sellers&#x27; performance was universally lauded by critics and is considered by critic Danny Smith to be the &quot;crowning triumph of Peter Sellers&#x27; remarkable career&quot;. Critic Frank Rich wrote that the acting skill required for this sort of role, with a &quot;schismatic personality that Peter had to convey with strenuous vocal and gestural technique ... A lesser actor would have made the character&#x27;s mental dysfunction flamboyant and drastic ... [His] intelligence was always deeper, his onscreen confidence greater, his technique much more finely honed&quot;: in achieving this, Sellers &quot;makes the film&#x27;s fantastic premise credible&quot;. The film earned Sellers a Best Actor award at the 51st National Board of Review Awards; the London Critics Circle Film Awards Special Achievement Award, the Best Actor award at the 45th New York Film Critics Circle Awards; and the Best Actor – Musical or Comedy award at the 37th Golden Globe Awards. Additionally, Sellers was nominated for the Best Actor award at the 52nd Academy Awards and the Best Actor in a Leading Role award at the 34th British Academy Film Awards.

In March 1980, Sellers asked his 15-year-old daughter Victoria what she thought about &quot;Being There&quot;: she reported later that &quot;I said yes, I thought it was great. But then I said, &#x27;You looked like a little fat old man&#x27;. ... he went mad. He threw his drink over me and told me to get the next plane home.&quot; His other daughter Sarah told Sellers her thoughts about the incident and he sent her a telegram that read &quot;After what happened this morning with Victoria, I shall be happy if I never hear from you again. I won&#x27;t tell you what I think of you. It must be obvious. Goodbye, Your Father.&quot;

Sellers&#x27; last film was &quot;The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu&quot;, a comedic re-imagining of the eponymous adventure novels by Sax Rohmer; Sellers played both police inspector Nayland Smith and Fu Manchu, alongside Helen Mirren and David Tomlinson. The production of the film was troublesome before filming started, with two directors—Richard Quine and John Avildsen—fired before the script had been completed. Sellers also expressed dissatisfaction with his own portrayal of Manchu with his ill-health often causing delays. Arguments between Sellers and director Piers Haggard led to Haggard&#x27;s firing at Sellers&#x27; instigation and Sellers took over direction, using his long-time friend David Lodge to direct some sequences. Tom Shales of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the film as &quot;an indefensibly inept comedy&quot;, adding that &quot;it is hard to name another good actor who ever made so many bad movies as Sellers, a comedian of great gifts but ferociously faulty judgment. &quot;Manchu&quot; will take its rightful place alongside such colossally ill-advised washouts as &quot;Tell Me Where It Hurts&quot;, &quot;The Bobo&quot; and &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;&quot;.

Sellers&#x27; final performances were a series of advertisements for Barclays Bank. Filmed in April 1980 in Ireland, he played Monty Casino, a Jewish con-man. Four advertisements were scheduled, but only three were filmed as Sellers collapsed in Dublin, again with heart problems. After two days in care—and against the advice of his doctors—he travelled to the Cannes Film Festival, where &quot;Being There&quot; was in competition. Sellers was again ill in Cannes, returning to his residence in Gstaad to work on the script for his next project, &quot;Romance of the Pink Panther&quot;. At the urging of his friends, he made an appointment to undergo an angiogram at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on 30 July 1980, to see if he was able to undergo open-heart surgery. Spike Milligan later considered that Sellers&#x27; heart condition had lasted for over 15 years and had &quot;made life difficult for him and had a debilitating effect on his personality.&quot; Sellers&#x27; fourth marriage to Frederick collapsed soon after. Sellers had recently started to rebuild his relationship with his son Michael after the failure of the latter&#x27;s marriage. In lighter moments, Sellers had joked that his epitaph should read &quot;Star of stage, screen and alimony.&quot;

===Death and subsequent family issues===
On 21 July 1980, Sellers arrived in London from Geneva. He checked into the Dorchester hotel, before visiting Golders Green Crematorium for the first time to see the location of his parents&#x27; ashes. He had plans to attend a reunion dinner with his &quot;Goon Show&quot; partners Milligan and Secombe, scheduled for the evening of 22 July. On the day of the dinner, Sellers took lunch in his hotel suite and shortly afterwards collapsed from a heart attack. He was taken to the Middlesex Hospital, London, and died just after midnight on 24 July 1980, aged 54.

Following Sellers&#x27; death, fellow actor Richard Attenborough said that Sellers &quot;had the genius comparable to Chaplin&quot;, while the Boulting brothers considered Sellers as &quot;a man of enormous gifts; and these gifts he gave to the world. For them, he is assured of a place in the history of art as entertainment.&quot; Burt Kwouk, who appeared as Cato in the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; films, stated that &quot;Peter was a well-loved actor in Britain ... the day he died, it seemed that the whole country came to a stop. Everywhere you went, the fact that Peter had died seemed like an umbrella over everything&quot;. Director Blake Edwards thought that &quot;Peter was brilliant. He had an enormous facility for finding really unusual, unique facets of the character he was playing&quot;. Sellers&#x27; friend and &quot;Goon Show&quot; colleague Spike Milligan was too upset to speak to the press at the time of Sellers&#x27; death, while fellow Goon Harry Secombe said &quot;I&#x27;m shattered. Peter was such a tremendous artist. He had so much talent, it just oozed out of him&quot;; in dark humour, referring to the missed dinner the Goons had planned, he added, &quot;Anything to avoid paying for dinner&quot;. Secombe later declared to journalists &quot;Bluebottle is deaded now&quot;. Milligan later said that &quot;it&#x27;s hard to say this, but he died at the right time.&quot;

A private funeral service was held at Golders Green Crematorium on 26 July, conducted by Sellers&#x27; old friend, Canon John Hester. Sellers&#x27; final joke was the playing of &quot;In the Mood&quot; by Glenn Miller, a tune which all the Goons hated; he knew they would have to sit there in silence and listen to it. A memorial service was held at St Martin-in-the-Fields on 8 September 1980—what would have been Sellers&#x27; 55th birthday. Close friend Lord Snowdon read the twenty-third Psalm, Harry Secombe sang &quot;Bread of Heaven&quot; and the eulogy was read by David Niven.

Although Sellers was reportedly in the process of excluding Frederick from his will a week before he died, she inherited almost his entire estate worth an estimated £4.5 million (£ million in pounds) while his children received £800 each (£ in pounds). Spike Milligan appealed to her on behalf of Sellers&#x27; three children, but she refused to increase the amount. Sellers&#x27; only son, Michael, died of a heart attack at 52 during surgery on 24 July 2006, twenty-six years to the day after his father&#x27;s death.

After his death, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer tried to continue with &quot;Romance of the Pink Panther&quot; and offered the role of Clouseau to Dudley Moore, who turned it down. The studio subsequently returned to Blake Edwards, who was adamant not to recast the character, feeling certain that no one could adequately replace Sellers. In 1982 Edwards released &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot;, which was composed entirely of deleted scenes from his past three &quot;Panther&quot; films. Frederick sued, claiming the use of the clips was a breach of contract; the court awarded her $1million ($ million in ), plus 3.15 per cent of the film&#x27;s profits and 1.36 per cent of its gross revenue.

== Technique ==
Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of the Pink Panther films &quot;I&#x27;m not sure why Mr. Sellers and Mr. Lom are such a hilarious team, though it may be because each is a fine comic actor with a special talent for portraying the sort of all-consuming, epic self-absorption that makes slapstick farce initially acceptable—instead of alarming—and finally so funny.&quot; The film critic Elvis Mitchell said that Sellers was one of the few comic geniuses who was able to truly hide behind his characters, giving the audience no sense of what he was really like in real life. A feature of the characterisations undertaken by Sellers is that, regardless of how clumsy or idiotic they are, he ensured that they always retain their dignity. On his playing of Clouseau, Sellers said: &quot;I set out to play Clouseau with great dignity because I feel that he thinks he is probably one of the greatest detectives in the world. The original script makes him out to be a complete idiot. I thought a forgivable vanity would humanise him and make him kind of touching.&quot;

Sellers&#x27; biographer, Ed Sikov, notes that because of this retained dignity, Sellers is &quot;the master of playing men who have no idea how ridiculous they are.&quot; Social historian Sam Wasson notes the complexity in Sellers&#x27; performances in the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; films, which has the effect of alienating Clouseau from his environment. Wesson considers that &quot;As &#x27;low&#x27; and &#x27;high&#x27; comedy rolled into one, it&#x27;s the performative counterpoint to Edwardian sophisticated naturalism&quot;. This combination of &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot;, exemplified by Clouseau&#x27;s attempting to retain dignity after a fall, means that within the film Clouseau was &quot;the sole representative of humanity&quot;. Film critic Dilys Powell also saw the inherent dignity in the parts and wrote that Sellers had a &quot;balance between character and absurdity&quot;. Richard Attenborough also thought that because of his sympathy, Sellers could &quot;inject into his characterisations the frailty and substance of a human being&quot;.

Author Aaron Sultanik observed that in Sellers&#x27; early films, such as &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot;, he displays &quot;deft, technical interpretations [that] pinpoint the mechanical nature of his comic characterization&quot;, which &quot;reduces each of his characters to a series of gross, awkward tics&quot;. Academic Cynthia Baron observed that Sellers&#x27; external characterisations led to doubt with reviewers as to whether Sellers&#x27; work was &quot;true&quot; acting. Critic Tom Milne saw a change over Sellers&#x27; career and thought that his &quot;comic genius as a character actor was ... stifled by his elevation to leading man&quot; and his later films suffered as a result. Sultanik agreed, commenting that Sellers&#x27; &quot;exceptional vocal and physical technique&quot; was under-used during his career in the US.

Academics Maria Pramaggiore and Tom Wallis remarked that Sellers fits the mould of a technical actor because he displays a mastery of physical characterisation, such as accent or physical trait. Writer and playwright John Mortimer saw the process for himself when Sellers was about to undertake filming on Mortimer&#x27;s &quot;The Dock Brief&quot; and could not decide how to play the character of the barrister. By chance he ordered cockles for lunch and the smell brought back a memory of the seaside town of Morecambe: this gave him &quot;the idea of a faded North Country accent and the suggestion of a scrappy moustache&quot;. So important was the voice as the starting point for character development, that Sellers would walk around London with a reel-to-reel tape recorder, recording voices to study at home.

== Legacy ==

&quot;New York&quot; magazine stated that all of the films starring Sellers as Clouseau showcased his &quot;comedic brilliance&quot;. Sellers&#x27; friend and &quot;Goon Show&quot; colleague Spike Milligan said that Sellers &quot;had one of the most glittering comic talents of his age&quot;, while English filmmakers John and Roy Boulting stated that he was &quot;the greatest comic genius this country has produced since Charles Chaplin&quot;. Irv Slifkin said that the most prominent albeit ever-changing face in comedies of the 1960s was Sellers who &quot;changed like a chameleon throughout the era, dazzling audiences&quot;. In a 2005 poll to find &quot;The Comedian&#x27;s Comedian&quot;, Sellers was voted 14 in the list of the top 20 greatest comedians by fellow comics and comedy insiders.

Sellers and &quot;The Goon Show&quot; were a strong influence on the Monty Python performers, with John Cleese calling him &quot;the greatest voice man of all time&quot;, adding, &quot;If he could listen to you for five minutes, he could do a perfect impersonation of you.&quot; The Goons were imported to the United States by the NBC program &quot;Monitor&quot;, which played recorded Goon show episodes starting in 1955. The American comedy troupe the Firesign Theatre also cited the Goons as a big influence on their radio comedy style.

Sellers and the Goons were also an influence on Peter Cook, who described Sellers as &quot;the best comic actor in the world&quot;. British actor Stephen Mangan stated that Sellers was a large influence, as did the comedians Mike Myers, Alan Carr and Rob Brydon. Sellers&#x27; characters Hrundi Bakshi (&quot;The Party&quot;) and Inspector Clouseau (&quot;The Pink Panther&quot;) later influenced comedian Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s characters Mr. Bean and Johnny English. The comic performer Sacha Baron Cohen referred to Sellers as &quot;the most seminal force in shaping [his] early ideas on comedy&quot;. Cohen was considered for the role of Sellers in the biographical film &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot;. Will Ferrell considers Sellers to be an important influence on him, citing his &quot;unique combination of being extremely subtle and over-the-top all at the same time.&quot; The three members of Spinal Tap—Michael McKean, Christopher Guest and Harry Shearer—have also cited Sellers as being an influence on them, as has the US talk-show host Conan O&#x27;Brien. David Schwimmer is another whose approach was influenced by Sellers: &quot;he could do anything, from Dr Strangelove to Inspector Clouseau. He was just amazing.&quot;

As a child, Eddie Murphy developed his dual acting skills in imitation of Sellers, whom he called his acting hero, with Chris Rock hailing Murphy&#x27;s performances (such as the multiple roles in &quot;The Nutty Professor&quot;) as &quot;Peter Sellers-esque&quot;. During an interview in 2002, Robin Williams told Michael Parkinson that Sellers was an important influence, especially his multi-character roles in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, stating, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t get better than that.&quot; Williams was considered to play Sellers in the HBO biopic but turned it down over scheduling conflicts, though Williams considered it an honour to be able to portray him. Eddie Izzard notes that the Goons &quot;influenced a new generation of comedians who came to be known as &#x27;alternative&#x27;&quot;—including herself, while the media historian Graham McCann states &quot;the anarchic spirit of the Goon Show ... would inspire, directly or indirectly and to varying extents, ... &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, &quot;The Young Ones&quot;, &quot;Vic Reeves Big Night Out&quot;, &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; [and] &quot;Brass Eye&quot;.&quot;

The stage play &quot;Being Sellers&quot; premiered in Australia in 1998, three years after the release of the biography by Roger Lewis, &quot;The Life and Death of Peter Sellers&quot;. In 2004, the book was turned into an HBO film with the same title, starring Geoffrey Rush. The play later transferred to New York in December 2010. &quot;The Belfast Telegraph&quot; notes how the film captured Sellers&#x27; &quot;life of drugs, drink, fast cars and lots and lots of beautiful women&quot;.

<text>Project Runeberg () is a digital cultural archive initiative that publishes free electronic versions of books significant to the culture and history of the Nordic countries. Patterned after Project Gutenberg, it was founded by Lars Aronsson and colleagues at Linköping University and began archiving Nordic-language literature in December 1992. As of 2015 it had accomplished digitization to provide graphical facsimiles of old works such as the &quot;Nordisk familjebok&quot;, and had accomplished, in whole or in part, the text extractions and copyediting of these as well as esteemed Latin works and English translations from Nordic authors, and sheet music and other texts of cultural interest.

== Nature and history ==
Project Runeberg is a digital cultural archive initiative patterned after the English-language cultural initiative, Project Gutenberg; it was founded by Lars Aronsson and colleagues at Linköping University, especially within the university group Lysator (see below), with the aim of publishing free electronic versions of books significant to the culture and history of the Nordic countries. The Project began archiving its first Nordic-language literature pieces (parts of the &quot;Fänrik Ståls Sägner&quot;, of Nordic dictionaries and of a Bible from 1917) in December 1992.

== Name ==
In its naming, a moniker similar to &quot;Gutenberg&quot; was desired. The Project was thereby given the name of Finland&#x27;s national poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg, and so contained a further allusion based on the meanings of its component parts — &quot;Rune&quot; (letter in Runic script) and &quot;&quot; (mountain) — so that in most Nordic languages it can be translated loosely as &quot;mountain of letters&quot;.

== Achievements ==

The Project began archiving Nordic-language literature in December 1992. As of 2015 it had accomplished digitization to provide graphical facsimiles of old works such as the &quot;Nordisk familjebok&quot;, and had accomplished, in whole or in part, the text extractions and copyediting of these as well as esteemed Latin works and English translations from Nordic authors – e.g., Carl August Hagberg&#x27;s interpretations of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays – and sheet music and other texts of cultural interest.

== Technology ==
By 2001, technology – image scanning and optical character recognition techniques – had improved enough to allow full digitization and text extraction of important target texts, e.g., of both print editions of the &quot;Nordisk familjebok&quot; (45,000 pages). Project Runeberg is hosted by an academic computer group, Lysator, at Linköping University, in Linköping in southern Sweden.

<doc id="24521" wikidata="Q2335664" url="?curid=24521" title="Pico (text editor)">
<text>Pico (Pine composer) is a text editor for Unix and Unix-like computer systems. It is integrated with Pine and Alpine, email clients initially designed by the Office of Computing and Communications at the University of Washington.

From the Pine FAQ: &quot;Pine&#x27;s message composition editor is also available as a separate stand-alone program, called PICO. PICO is a very simple and easy-to-use text editor offering paragraph justification, cut/paste, and a spelling checker...&quot;.

== Features ==

Pico does not support working with several files simultaneously and cannot perform a find and replace across multiple files. It also cannot copy partial text from one file to another (though it is possible to read text into the editor from a whole file in its working directory). Pico does support search and replace operations.

By comparison, some popular Unix text editors such as vi and Emacs provide a wider range of features than Pico; including regular expression search and replace, and working with multiple files at the same time. By comparison, Pico&#x27;s simplicity makes it suitable for beginners. 

== Basic commands and navigation ==

Pico features a number of commands for editing. Arrow keys move the cursor a character at the time in the direction of the movement. Inserting a character is done by pressing the corresponding character key in the keyboard, while giving commands (such as save, spell check, justify, search, etc.) is done using a control key.

The command is used to spell check. The speller is defined from the command line using the -s option. When a person writes files in different languages, the speller can be set to be a script that interacts with the user to select the language to be checked.

The command is used to left justify text. Text is flowed in each line of a paragraph up to a limit set with the -r option in the command line. If no limit is given in the command line, then a default value of 72 characters per line is used. This limit is used to wrap lines during composition, as well as to justify text. The command justifies the text in the paragraph that the cursor is placed on. The command is used to justify the full file. In case that justification is not done correctly, or by mistake, it can be undone by pressing the command immediately after justification has been done.

The command is used to search for text. Search is done case insensitively, The search and replace command is not available by default, but must be enabled through the -b option in the command line.

Moving inside the editor can be done using the keyboard by using the arrow keys. Keys such as , or , scroll the text up or down (towards the beginning or end of the file, respectively). The commands , and move the cursor to the beginning or end of the file respectively, while the commands and move the cursor to the beginning and the end of the line that the cursor is located on.

== Derivatives ==

A clone of Pico called nano, which is part of the GNU Project, was developed because Pico&#x27;s earlier license had unclear redistribution terms. Newer versions of Pico as part of Alpine are released under the Apache License version 2.0.

<text>In statistics, a power law is a functional relationship between two quantities, where a relative change in one quantity results in a relative change in the other quantity proportional to the change raised to a constant exponent: one quantity varies as a power of another. The change is independent of the initial size of those quantities.

For instance, the area of a square has a power law relationship with the length of its side, since if the length is doubled, the area is multiplied by 2, while if the length is tripled, the area is multiplied by 3, and so on.

==Empirical examples==
The distributions of a wide variety of physical, biological, and human-made phenomena approximately follow a power law over a wide range of magnitudes: these include the sizes of craters on the moon and of solar flares, cloud sizes, the foraging pattern of various species, the sizes of activity patterns of neuronal populations, the frequencies of words in most languages, frequencies of family names, the species richness in clades of organisms, the sizes of power outages, volcanic eruptions, human judgments of stimulus intensity and many other quantities. Empirical distributions can only fit a power law for a limited range of values, because a pure power law would allow for arbitrarily large or small values.
Acoustic attenuation follows frequency power-laws within wide frequency bands for many complex media. Allometric scaling laws for relationships between biological variables are among the best known power-law functions in nature.
==Properties==

===Statistical incompleteness===
The power-law model does not obey the treasured paradigm of statistical completeness. Especially probability bounds, the suspected cause of typical bending and/or flattening phenomena in the high- and low-frequency graphical segments, are parametrically absent in the standard model.

===Scale invariance===
One attribute of power laws is their scale invariance. Given a relation formula_1, scaling the argument formula_2 by a constant factor formula_3 causes only a proportionate scaling of the function itself. That is,

:formula_4

where formula_5 denotes direct proportionality. That is, scaling by a constant formula_3 simply multiplies the original power-law relation by the constant formula_7. Thus, it follows that all power laws with a particular scaling exponent are equivalent up to constant factors, since each is simply a scaled version of the others. This behavior is what produces the linear relationship when logarithms are taken of both formula_8 and formula_2, and the straight-line on the log–log plot is often called the &quot;signature&quot; of a power law. With real data, such straightness is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for the data following a power-law relation. In fact, there are many ways to generate finite amounts of data that mimic this signature behavior, but, in their asymptotic limit, are not true power laws. Thus, accurately fitting and validating power-law models is an active area of research in statistics; see below.

===Lack of well-defined average value===
A power-law formula_10 has a well-defined mean over formula_11 only if formula_12, and it has a finite variance only if formula_13; most identified power laws in nature have exponents such that the mean is well-defined but the variance is not, implying they are capable of black swan behavior. This can be seen in the following thought experiment: imagine a room with your friends and estimate the average monthly income in the room. Now imagine the world&#x27;s richest person entering the room, with a monthly income of about 1 billion US$. What happens to the average income in the room? Income is distributed according to a power-law known as the Pareto distribution (for example, the net worth of Americans is distributed according to a power law with an exponent of 2).

On the one hand, this makes it incorrect to apply traditional statistics that are based on variance and standard deviation (such as regression analysis). On the other hand, this also allows for cost-efficient interventions. For example, given that car exhaust is distributed according to a power-law among cars (very few cars contribute to most contamination) it would be sufficient to eliminate those very few cars from the road to reduce total exhaust substantially.

The median does exist, however: for a power law &quot;x&quot; –&quot;k&quot;, with exponent , it takes the value 21/(&quot;k&quot; – 1)&quot;x&quot;min, where &quot;x&quot;min is the minimum value for which the power law holds.

===Universality===
The equivalence of power laws with a particular scaling exponent can have a deeper origin in the dynamical processes that generate the power-law relation. In physics, for example, phase transitions in thermodynamic systems are associated with the emergence of power-law distributions of certain quantities, whose exponents are referred to as the critical exponents of the system. Diverse systems with the same critical exponents—that is, which display identical scaling behaviour as they approach criticality—can be shown, via renormalization group theory, to share the same fundamental dynamics. For instance, the behavior of water and CO2 at their boiling points fall in the same universality class because they have identical critical exponents. In fact, almost all material phase transitions are described by a small set of universality classes. Similar observations have been made, though not as comprehensively, for various self-organized critical systems, where the critical point of the system is an attractor. Formally, this sharing of dynamics is referred to as universality, and systems with precisely the same critical exponents are said to belong to the same universality class.

==Power-law functions==
Scientific interest in power-law relations stems partly from the ease with which certain general classes of mechanisms generate them. The demonstration of a power-law relation in some data can point to specific kinds of mechanisms that might underlie the natural phenomenon in question, and can indicate a deep connection with other, seemingly unrelated systems; see also universality above. The ubiquity of power-law relations in physics is partly due to dimensional constraints, while in complex systems, power laws are often thought to be signatures of hierarchy or of specific stochastic processes. A few notable examples of power laws are Pareto&#x27;s law of income distribution, structural self-similarity of fractals, scaling laws in biological systems, and scaling laws in cities. Research on the origins of power-law relations, and efforts to observe and validate them in the real world, is an active topic of research in many fields of science, including physics, computer science, linguistics, geophysics, neuroscience, systematics, sociology, economics and more.

However, much of the recent interest in power laws comes from the study of probability distributions: The distributions of a wide variety of quantities seem to follow the power-law form, at least in their upper tail (large events). The behavior of these large events connects these quantities to the study of theory of large deviations (also called extreme value theory), which considers the frequency of extremely rare events like stock market crashes and large natural disasters. It is primarily in the study of statistical distributions that the name &quot;power law&quot; is used.

In empirical contexts, an approximation to a power-law formula_14 often includes a deviation term formula_15, which can represent uncertainty in the observed values (perhaps measurement or sampling errors) or provide a simple way for observations to deviate from the power-law function (perhaps for stochastic reasons):

:formula_16

Mathematically, a strict power law cannot be a probability distribution, but a distribution that is a truncated power function is possible: formula_17 for formula_18 where the exponent formula_19 (Greek letter alpha, not to be confused with scaling factor formula_20 used above) is greater than 1 (otherwise the tail has infinite area), the minimum value formula_21 is needed otherwise the distribution has infinite area as &quot;x&quot; approaches 0, and the constant &quot;C&quot; is a scaling factor to ensure that the total area is 1, as required by a probability distribution. More often one uses an asymptotic power law – one that is only true in the limit; see power-law probability distributions below for details. Typically the exponent falls in the range formula_22, though not always.

===Variants===

====Broken power law====

A broken power law is a piecewise function, consisting of two or more power laws, combined with a threshold. For example, with two power laws:

:formula_23 for formula_24
:formula_25.

==== Smoothly broken power law ====
The pieces of a broken power law can be smoothly spliced together to construct a smoothly broken power law. 

There are different possible ways to splice together power laws. One example is the following:formula_26where formula_27.
When the function is plotted as a log-log plot with horizontal axis being formula_28 and vertical axis being formula_29, the plot is composed of formula_30 linear segments with slopes formula_31, separated at formula_32, smoothly spliced together. The size of formula_33 determines the sharpness of splicing between segments formula_34.

====Power law with exponential cutoff====
A power law with an exponential cutoff is simply a power law multiplied by an exponential function:

:formula_35

====Curved power law====
:formula_36

==Power-law probability distributions==
In a looser sense, a power-law probability distribution is a distribution whose density function (or mass function in the discrete case) has the form, for large values of formula_2,

:formula_38

where formula_39, and formula_40 is a slowly varying function, which is any function that satisfies formula_41 for any positive factor formula_42. This property of formula_40 follows directly from the requirement that formula_44 be asymptotically scale invariant; thus, the form of formula_40 only controls the shape and finite extent of the lower tail. For instance, if formula_40 is the constant function, then we have a power law that holds for all values of formula_2. In many cases, it is convenient to assume a lower bound formula_48 from which the law holds. Combining these two cases, and where formula_2 is a continuous variable, the power law has the form of the Pareto distribution

:formula_50

where the pre-factor to formula_51 is the normalizing constant. We can now consider several properties of this distribution. For instance, its moments are given by

:formula_52

which is only well defined for formula_53. That is, all moments formula_54 diverge: when formula_55, the average and all higher-order moments are infinite; when formula_56, the mean exists, but the variance and higher-order moments are infinite, etc. For finite-size samples drawn from such distribution, this behavior implies that the central moment estimators (like the mean and the variance) for diverging moments will never converge – as more data is accumulated, they continue to grow. These power-law probability distributions are also called Pareto-type distributions, distributions with Pareto tails, or distributions with regularly varying tails.

A modification, which does not satisfy the general form above, with an exponential cutoff, is

:formula_57

In this distribution, the exponential decay term formula_58 eventually overwhelms the power-law behavior at very large values of formula_2. This distribution does not scale and is thus not asymptotically as a power law; however, it does approximately scale over a finite region before the cutoff. The pure form above is a subset of this family, with formula_60. This distribution is a common alternative to the asymptotic power-law distribution because it naturally captures finite-size effects.

The Tweedie distributions are a family of statistical models characterized by closure under additive and reproductive convolution as well as under scale transformation. Consequently, these models all express a power-law relationship between the variance and the mean. These models have a fundamental role as foci of mathematical convergence similar to the role that the normal distribution has as a focus in the central limit theorem. This convergence effect explains why the variance-to-mean power law manifests so widely in natural processes, as with Taylor&#x27;s law in ecology and with fluctuation scaling in physics. It can also be shown that this variance-to-mean power law, when demonstrated by the method of expanding bins, implies the presence of 1/&quot;f&quot; noise and that 1/&quot;f&quot; noise can arise as a consequence of this Tweedie convergence effect.

===Graphical methods for identification===

Although more sophisticated and robust methods have been proposed, the most frequently used graphical methods of identifying power-law probability distributions using random samples are Pareto quantile-quantile plots (or Pareto Q–Q plots), mean residual life plots and log–log plots. Another, more robust graphical method uses bundles of residual quantile functions. (Please keep in mind that power-law distributions are also called Pareto-type distributions.) It is assumed here that a random sample is obtained from a probability distribution, and that we want to know if the tail of the distribution follows a power law (in other words, we want to know if the distribution has a &quot;Pareto tail&quot;). Here, the random sample is called &quot;the data&quot;.

==== Pareto Q–Q plots ====
Pareto Q–Q plots compare the quantiles of the log-transformed data to the corresponding quantiles of an exponential distribution with mean 1 (or to the quantiles of a standard Pareto distribution) by plotting the former versus the latter. If the resultant scatterplot suggests that the plotted points &quot;asymptotically converge&quot; to a straight line, then a power-law distribution should be suspected. A limitation of Pareto Q–Q plots is that they behave poorly when the tail index formula_19 (also called Pareto index) is close to 0, because Pareto Q–Q plots are not designed to identify distributions with slowly varying tails.

==== Mean residual life plots ====
On the other hand, in its version for identifying power-law probability distributions, the mean residual life plot consists of first log-transforming the data, and then plotting the average of those log-transformed data that are higher than the &quot;i&quot;-th order statistic versus the &quot;i&quot;-th order statistic, for &quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;n&quot;, where n is the size of the random sample. If the resultant scatterplot suggests that the plotted points tend to stabilize about a horizontal straight line, then a power-law distribution should be suspected. Since the mean residual life plot is very sensitive to outliers (it is not robust), it usually produces plots that are difficult to interpret; for this reason, such plots are usually called Hill horror plots.

==== Log-log plots ====
Log–log plots are an alternative way of graphically examining the tail of a distribution using a random sample. Taking the logarithm of a power law of the form formula_62 results in:

:formula_63

which forms a straight line with slope formula_64 on a log-log scale. Caution has to be exercised however as a log–log plot is necessary but insufficient evidence for a power law relationship, as many non power-law distributions will appear as straight lines on a log–log plot. This method consists of plotting the logarithm of an estimator of the probability that a particular number of the distribution occurs versus the logarithm of that particular number. Usually, this estimator is the proportion of times that the number occurs in the data set. If the points in the plot tend to converge to a straight line for large numbers in the x axis, then the researcher concludes that the distribution has a power-law tail. Examples of the application of these types of plot have been published. A disadvantage of these plots is that, in order for them to provide reliable results, they require huge amounts of data. In addition, they are appropriate only for discrete (or grouped) data.

==== Bundle plots ====
Another graphical method for the identification of power-law probability distributions using random samples has been proposed. This methodology consists of plotting a &quot;bundle for the log-transformed sample&quot;. Originally proposed as a tool to explore the existence of moments and the moment generation function using random samples, the bundle methodology is based on residual quantile functions (RQFs), also called residual percentile functions, which provide a full characterization of the tail behavior of many well-known probability distributions, including power-law distributions, distributions with other types of heavy tails, and even non-heavy-tailed distributions. Bundle plots do not have the disadvantages of Pareto Q–Q plots, mean residual life plots and log–log plots mentioned above (they are robust to outliers, allow visually identifying power laws with small values of formula_19, and do not demand the collection of much data). In addition, other types of tail behavior can be identified using bundle plots.

===Plotting power-law distributions===
In general, power-law distributions are plotted on doubly logarithmic axes, which emphasizes the upper tail region. The most convenient way to do this is via the (complementary) cumulative distribution (ccdf) that is, the survival function, formula_66,

:formula_67

The cdf is also a power-law function, but with a smaller scaling exponent. For data, an equivalent form of the cdf is the rank-frequency approach, in which we first sort the formula_68 observed values in ascending order, and plot them against the vector formula_69.

Although it can be convenient to log-bin the data, or otherwise smooth the probability density (mass) function directly, these methods introduce an implicit bias in the representation of the data, and thus should be avoided. The survival function, on the other hand, is more robust to (but not without) such biases in the data and preserves the linear signature on doubly logarithmic axes. Though a survival function representation is favored over that of the pdf while fitting a power law to the data with the linear least square method, it is not devoid of mathematical inaccuracy. Thus, while estimating exponents of a power law distribution, maximum likelihood estimator is recommended.

===Estimating the exponent from empirical data===
There are many ways of estimating the value of the scaling exponent for a power-law tail, however not all of them yield unbiased and consistent answers. Some of the most reliable techniques are often based on the method of maximum likelihood. Alternative methods are often based on making a linear regression on either the log–log probability, the log–log cumulative distribution function, or on log-binned data, but these approaches should be avoided as they can all lead to highly biased estimates of the scaling exponent.

====Maximum likelihood====

For real-valued, independent and identically distributed data, we fit a power-law distribution of the form

: formula_70

to the data formula_71, where the coefficient formula_51 is included to ensure that the distribution is normalized. Given a choice for formula_73, the log likelihood function becomes:

:formula_74 
The maximum of this likelihood is found by differentiating with respect to parameter formula_19, setting the result equal to zero. Upon rearrangement, this yields the estimator equation:

:formula_76

where formula_77 are the formula_68 data points formula_79. This estimator exhibits a small finite sample-size bias of order formula_80, which is small when &quot;n&quot; &gt; 100. Further, the standard error of the estimate is formula_81. This estimator is equivalent to the popular Hill estimator from quantitative finance and extreme value theory.

For a set of &quot;n&quot; integer-valued data points formula_77, again where each formula_83, the maximum likelihood exponent is the solution to the transcendental equation

: formula_84

where formula_85 is the incomplete zeta function. The uncertainty in this estimate follows the same formula as for the continuous equation. However, the two equations for formula_86 are not equivalent, and the continuous version should not be applied to discrete data, nor vice versa.

Further, both of these estimators require the choice of formula_73. For functions with a non-trivial formula_40 function, choosing formula_73 too small produces a significant bias in formula_90, while choosing it too large increases the uncertainty in formula_86, and reduces the statistical power of our model. In general, the best choice of formula_73 depends strongly on the particular form of the lower tail, represented by formula_40 above.

More about these methods, and the conditions under which they can be used, can be found in . Further, this comprehensive review article provides usable code (Matlab, Python, R and C++) for estimation and testing routines for power-law distributions.

====Kolmogorov–Smirnov estimation====

Another method for the estimation of the power-law exponent, which does not assume independent and identically distributed (iid) data, uses the minimization of the Kolmogorov–Smirnov statistic, formula_94, between the cumulative distribution functions of the data and the power law:

: formula_95

with

: formula_96

where formula_97 and formula_98 denote the cdfs of the data and the power law with exponent formula_19, respectively. As this method does not assume iid data, it provides an alternative way to determine the power-law exponent for data sets in which the temporal correlation can not be ignored.

====Two-point fitting method====
This criterion can be applied for the estimation of power-law exponent in the case of scale-free distributions and provides a more convergent estimate than the maximum likelihood method. It has been applied to study probability distributions of fracture apertures. In some contexts the probability distribution is described, not by the cumulative distribution function, by the cumulative frequency of a property &quot;X&quot;, defined as the number of elements per meter (or area unit, second etc.) for which &quot;X&quot; &gt; &quot;x&quot; applies, where &quot;x&quot; is a variable real number. As an example, the cumulative distribution of the fracture aperture, &quot;X&quot;, for a sample of &quot;N&quot; elements is defined as &#x27;the number of fractures per meter having aperture greater than &quot;x&quot; . Use of cumulative frequency has some advantages, e.g. it allows one to put on the same diagram data gathered from sample lines of different lengths at different scales (e.g. from outcrop and from microscope).

==Validating power laws==
Although power-law relations are attractive for many theoretical reasons, demonstrating that data does indeed follow a power-law relation requires more than simply fitting a particular model to the data. This is important for understanding the mechanism that gives rise to the distribution: superficially similar distributions may arise for significantly different reasons, and different models yield different predictions, such as extrapolation.

For example, log-normal distributions are often mistaken for power-law distributions: a data set drawn from a lognormal distribution will be approximately linear for large values (corresponding to the upper tail of the lognormal being close to a power law), but for small values the lognormal will drop off significantly (bowing down), corresponding to the lower tail of the lognormal being small (there are very few small values, rather than many small values in a power law).

For example, Gibrat&#x27;s law about proportional growth processes produce distributions that are lognormal, although their log–log plots look linear over a limited range. An explanation of this is that although the logarithm of the lognormal density function is quadratic in , yielding a &quot;bowed&quot; shape in a log–log plot, if the quadratic term is small relative to the linear term then the result can appear almost linear, and the lognormal behavior is only visible when the quadratic term dominates, which may require significantly more data. Therefore, a log–log plot that is slightly &quot;bowed&quot; downwards can reflect a log-normal distribution – not a power law.

In general, many alternative functional forms can appear to follow a power-law form for some extent. proposed plotting the empirical cumulative distribution function in the log-log domain and claimed that a candidate power-law should cover at least two orders of magnitude. Also, researchers usually have to face the problem of deciding whether or not a real-world probability distribution follows a power law. As a solution to this problem, Diaz proposed a graphical methodology based on random samples that allow visually discerning between different types of tail behavior. This methodology uses bundles of residual quantile functions, also called percentile residual life functions, which characterize many different types of distribution tails, including both heavy and non-heavy tails. However, claimed the need for both a statistical and a theoretical background in order to support a power-law in the underlying mechanism driving the data generating process.

One method to validate a power-law relation tests many orthogonal predictions of a particular generative mechanism against data. Simply fitting a power-law relation to a particular kind of data is not considered a rational approach. As such, the validation of power-law claims remains a very active field of research in many areas of modern science.

<text>In chemistry, pH ( ), also referred to as &quot;acidity&quot; or &quot;basicity&quot;, historically denotes &quot;potential of hydrogen&quot; (or &quot;power of hydrogen&quot;). It is a logarithmic scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of aqueous solutions. Acidic solutions (solutions with higher concentrations of hydrogen () ions) are measured to have lower pH values than basic or alkaline solutions.

The pH scale is logarithmic and inversely indicates the activity of hydrogen ions in the solution
: formula_1
where [H+] is the equilibrium molar concentration of H+ (in M = mol/L) in the solution. At 25 °C (77 °F), solutions of which the pH is less than 7 are acidic, and solutions of which the pH is greater than 7 are basic. Solutions with a pH of 7 at 25 °C are neutral (i.e. have the same concentration of H+ ions as OH− ions, i.e. the same as pure water). The neutral value of the pH depends on the temperature and is lower than 7 if the temperature increases above 25 °C. The pH range is commonly given as zero to 14, but a pH value can be less than 0 for very concentrated strong acids or greater than 14 for very concentrated strong bases.

The pH scale is traceable to a set of standard solutions whose pH is established by international agreement. Primary pH standard values are determined using a concentration cell with transference by measuring the potential difference between a hydrogen electrode and a standard electrode such as the silver chloride electrode. The pH of aqueous solutions can be measured with a glass electrode and a pH meter or a color-changing indicator. Measurements of pH are important in chemistry, agronomy, medicine, water treatment, and many other applications.

== History ==
In 1909, the Danish chemist Søren Peter Lauritz Sørensen introduced the concept of pH at the Carlsberg Laboratory, originally using the notation &quot;pH•&quot;, with H• as a subscript to the lowercase p. The concept was later revised in 1924 to the modern pH to accommodate definitions and measurements in terms of electrochemical cells.For the sign &quot;p&quot;, I propose the name &#x27;hydrogen ion exponent&#x27; and the symbol pH•. Then, for the hydrogen ion exponent (pH•) of a solution, the negative value of the Briggsian logarithm of the related hydrogen ion normality factor is to be understood.Sørensen did not explain why he used the letter p, and the exact meaning of the letter is still disputed. Sørensen described a way of measuring pH using &quot;potential&quot; differences, and it represents the negative &quot;power&quot; of 10 in the concentration of hydrogen ions. The letter &quot;p&quot; could stand for the French &quot;puissance,&quot; German &quot;Potenz,&quot; or Danish &quot;potens&quot;, all meaning &quot;power&quot;, or it could mean &quot;potential&quot;. All of these words start with the letter &quot;p&quot; in French, German, and Danish, which were the languages in which Sørensen published: Carlsberg Laboratory was French-speaking; German was the dominant language of scientific publishing; Sørensen was Danish. He also used the letter &quot;q&quot; in much the same way elsewhere in the paper, and he might have arbitrarily labelled the test solution &quot;p&quot; and the reference solution &quot;q&quot;; these letters are often paired with e4 then e5. Some literature sources suggest that &quot;pH&quot; stands for the Latin term &quot;pondus hydrogenii&quot; (quantity of hydrogen) or &quot;potentia hydrogenii&quot; (power of hydrogen), although this is not supported by Sørensen&#x27;s writings.

In modern chemistry, the p stands for &quot;the negative decimal logarithm of&quot;, and is used in the term p&quot;K&quot;a for acid dissociation constants, so pH is &quot;the negative decimal logarithm of H+ ion concentration&quot;, while pOH is &quot;the negative decimal logarithm of OH− ion concentration&quot;. 

Bacteriologist Alice Catherine Evans, who influenced dairying and food safety, credited William Mansfield Clark and colleagues, including herself, with developing pH measuring methods in the 1910s, which had a wide influence on laboratory and industrial use thereafter. In her memoir, she does not mention how much, or how little, Clark and colleagues knew about Sørensen&#x27;s work a few years prior. She said:In these studies [of bacterial metabolism] Dr. Clark&#x27;s attention was directed to the effect of acid on the growth of bacteria. He found that it is the intensity of the acid in terms of hydrogen-ion concentration that affects their growth. But existing methods of measuring acidity determined the quantity, not the intensity, of the acid. Next, with his collaborators, Dr. Clark developed accurate methods for measuring hydrogen-ion concentration. These methods replaced the inaccurate titration method of determining the acid content in use in biologic laboratories throughout the world. Also they were found to be applicable in many industrial and other processes in which they came into wide usage.The first electronic method for measuring pH was invented by Arnold Orville Beckman, a professor at the California Institute of Technology in 1934. It was in response to a request from the local citrus grower Sunkist, which wanted a better method for quickly testing the pH of lemons they were picking from their nearby orchards.

== Definition ==
=== pH ===
The pH of a solution is defined as the decimal logarithm of the reciprocal of the hydrogen ion activity, &quot;a&quot;H+. Mathematically, pH is expressed as:
: formula_2

For example, for a solution with a hydrogen ion activity of (i.e., the concentration of hydrogen ions), the pH of the solution can be calculated as follows:
: formula_3

The concept of pH was developed because ion-selective electrodes, which are used to measure pH, respond to activity. The electrode potential, &quot;E&quot;, follows the Nernst equation for the hydrogen ion, which can be expressed as:
: formula_4
where &quot;E&quot; is a measured potential, &quot;E&quot;0 is the standard electrode potential, &quot;R&quot; is the molar gas constant, &quot;T&quot; is the thermodynamic temperature, &quot;F&quot; is the Faraday constant. For , the number of electrons transferred is one. The electrode potential is proportional to pH when pH is defined in terms of activity.

The precise measurement of pH is presented in International Standard ISO 31-8 as follows: A galvanic cell is set up to measure the electromotive force (e.m.f.) between a reference electrode and an electrode sensitive to the hydrogen ion activity when they are both immersed in the same aqueous solution. The reference electrode may be a silver chloride electrode or a calomel electrode, and the hydrogen-ion selective electrode is a standard hydrogen electrode.

Firstly, the cell is filled with a solution of known hydrogen ion activity and the electromotive force, &quot;E&quot;S, is measured. Then the electromotive force, &quot;E&quot;X, of the same cell containing the solution of unknown pH is measured.
: formula_5

The difference between the two measured electromotive force values is proportional to pH. This method of calibration avoids the need to know the standard electrode potential. The proportionality constant, 1/&quot;z&quot;, is ideally equal to formula_6, the &quot;Nernstian slope&quot;.

In practice, a glass electrode is used instead of the cumbersome hydrogen electrode. A combined glass electrode has an in-built reference electrode. It is calibrated against Buffer solutions of known hydrogen ion () activity proposed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Two or more buffer solutions are used in order to accommodate the fact that the &quot;slope&quot; may differ slightly from ideal. To calibrate the electrode, it is first immersed in a standard solution, and the reading on a pH meter is adjusted to be equal to the standard buffer&#x27;s value. The reading from a second standard buffer solution is then adjusted using the &quot;slope&quot; control to be equal to the pH for that solution. Further details, are given in the IUPAC recommendations. When more than two buffer solutions are used the electrode is calibrated by fitting observed pH values to a straight line with respect to standard buffer values. Commercial standard buffer solutions usually come with information on the value at 25 °C and a correction factor to be applied for other temperatures.

The pH scale is logarithmic and therefore pH is a dimensionless quantity.

=== p[H] ===
This was the original definition of Sørensen in 1909, which was superseded in favor of pH in 1924. [H] is the concentration of hydrogen ions, denoted [] in modern chemistry. More correctly, the thermodynamic activity of in dilute solution should be replaced by []/&quot;c&quot;0, where the standard state concentration &quot;c&quot;0 = 1 mol/L. This ratio is a pure number whose logarithm can be defined.

It is possible to measure the concentration of hydrogen ions directly using an electrode calibrated in terms of hydrogen ion concentrations. One common method is to titrate a solution of known concentration of a strong acid with a solution of known concentration of strong base in the presence of a relatively high concentration of background electrolyte. By knowing the concentrations of the acid and base, the concentration of hydrogen ions can be calculated and the measured potential can be correlated with concentrations. The calibration is usually carried out using a Gran plot. This procedure makes the activity of hydrogen ions equal to the numerical value of concentration.

The glass electrode (and other Ion selective electrodes) should be calibrated in a medium similar to the one being investigated. For instance, if one wishes to measure the pH of a seawater sample, the electrode should be calibrated in a solution resembling seawater in its chemical composition.

The difference between p[H] and pH is quite small, and it has been stated that pH = p[H] + 0.04. However, it is common practice to use the term &quot;pH&quot; for both types of measurement.

=== pOH ===

pOH is sometimes used as a measure of the concentration of hydroxide ions, . By definition, pOH is the negative logarithm (to the base 10) of the hydroxide ion concentration (mol/L). pOH values can be derived from pH measurements and vice-versa. The concentration of hydroxide ions in water is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions by
: formula_7
where &quot;K&quot;W is the self-ionization constant of water. Taking Logarithms,
: formula_8

So, at room temperature, pOH ≈ 14 − pH. However this relationship is not strictly valid in other circumstances, such as in measurements of soil alkalinity.

== Measurement ==

=== pH Indicators ===
pH can be measured using indicators, which change color depending on the pH of the solution they are in. By comparing the color of a test solution to a standard color chart, the pH can be estimated to the nearest whole number. For more precise measurements, the color can be measured using a colorimeter or spectrophotometer. A Universal indicator is a mixture of several indicators that can provide a continuous color change over a range of pH values, typically from about pH 2 to pH 10. Universal indicator paper is made from absorbent paper that has been impregnated with a universal indicator. An alternative method of measuring pH is using an electronic pH meter, which directly measures the voltage difference between a pH-sensitive electrode and a reference electrode.

=== Non-aqueous solutions ===
pH values can be measured in non-aqueous solutions, but they are based on a different scale from aqueous pH values because the standard states used for calculating hydrogen ion concentrations (activities) are different. The hydrogen ion activity, &quot;a&quot;H+, is defined as:
: formula_9
where &quot;μ&quot;H+ is the chemical potential of the hydrogen ion, formula_10 is its chemical potential in the chosen standard state, &quot;R&quot; is the molar gas constant and &quot;T&quot; is the thermodynamic temperature. Therefore, pH values on the different scales cannot be compared directly because of differences in the solvated proton ions, such as lyonium ions, which require an insolvent scale that involves the transfer activity coefficient of hydronium/lyonium ion.

pH is an example of an acidity function, but others can be defined. For example, the Hammett acidity function, &quot;H&quot;0, has been developed in connection with Superacids.

=== Unified absolute pH scale ===
In 2010, a new approach to measuring pH was proposed, called the &quot;unified absolute pH scale&quot;. This approach allows for a common reference standard to be used across different solutions, regardless of their pH range. The unified absolute pH scale is based on the absolute chemical potential of the proton, as defined by the Lewis acid–base theory. This scale applies to liquids, gases, and even solids. The advantages of the unified absolute pH scale include consistency, accuracy, and applicability to a wide range of sample types. It is precise and versatile because it serves as a common reference standard for pH measurements. However, implementation efforts, compatibility with existing data, complexity, and potential costs are some challenges.

=== Extremes of pH measurements ===

The measurement of pH can become difficult at extremely acidic or alkaline conditions, such as below pH 2.5 (ca. 0.003 mol/dm3 acid) or above pH 10.5 (above ca. 0.0003 mol/dm3 alkaline). This is due to the breakdown of the Nernst equation in such conditions when using a glass electrode. Several factors contribute to this problem. First, liquid junction potentials may not be independent of pH. Second, the high ionic strength of concentrated solutions can affect the electrode potentials. At high pH the glass electrode may be affected by &quot;alkaline error&quot;, because the electrode becomes sensitive to the concentration of cations such as and in the solution. To overcome these problems, specially constructed electrodes are available.

Runoff from mines or mine tailings can produce some extremely low pH values, down to −3.6.

== Applications ==
Pure water has a pH of 7 at 25 °C, meaning it is neutral. When an acid is dissolved in water, the pH will be less than 7, while a base, or alkali, will have a pH greater than 7. A strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, at concentration 1 mol dm−3 has a pH of 0, while a strong alkali like sodium hydroxide, at the same concentration, has a pH of 14. Since pH is a logarithmic scale, a difference of one in pH is equivalent to a tenfold difference in hydrogen ion concentration.

Neutrality is not exactly 7 at 25 °C, but 7 serves as a good approximation in most cases. Neutrality occurs when the concentration of hydrogen ions ([]) equals the concentration of hydroxide ions ([]), or when their activities are equal. Since self-ionization of water holds the product of these concentration [] × [] = &quot;K&quot;w, it can be seen that at neutrality [] = [] = , or pH = p&quot;K&quot;w/2. p&quot;K&quot;w is approximately 14 but depends on ionic strength and temperature, and so the pH of neutrality does also. Pure water and a solution of NaCl in pure water are both neutral, since dissociation of water produces equal numbers of both ions. However the pH of the neutral NaCl solution will be slightly different from that of neutral pure water because the hydrogen and hydroxide ions&#x27; activity is dependent on ionic strength, so &quot;K&quot;w varies with ionic strength.

When pure water is exposed to air, it becomes mildly acidic. This is because water absorbs carbon dioxide from the air, which is then slowly converted into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions (essentially creating carbonic acid).
: &lt;chem&gt;CO2 + H2O &lt;=&gt; HCO3- + H+ &lt;/chem&gt;

=== pH in soil ===

The United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service, formerly Soil Conservation Service classifies soil pH ranges as follows:

Topsoil pH is influenced by soil parent material, erosional effects, climate and vegetation. A recent map of topsoil pH in Europe shows the alkaline soils in Mediterranean, Hungary, East Romania, North France. Scandinavian countries, Portugal, Poland and North Germany have more acid soils.

=== pH in plants ===

Plants contain pH-dependent pigments that can be used as pH indicators, such as those found in hibiscus, red cabbage (anthocyanin), and grapes (red wine). Citrus fruits have acidic juice primarily due to the presence of citric acid, while other carboxylic acids can be found in various living systems. The protonation state of phosphate derivatives, including ATP, is pH-dependent. Hemoglobin, an oxygen-transport enzyme, is also affected by pH in a phenomenon known as the Root effect.

=== pH in the ocean ===
The pH of seawater plays an important role in the ocean&#x27;s carbon cycle. There is evidence of ongoing ocean acidification (meaning a drop in pH value): Between 1950 and 2020, the average pH of the ocean surface fell from approximately 8.15 to 8.05. Carbon dioxide emissions from human activities are the primary cause of ocean acidification, with atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels exceeding 410 ppm (in 2020). CO2 from the atmosphere is absorbed by the oceans. This produces carbonic acid (H2CO3) which dissociates into a bicarbonate ion () and a hydrogen ion (H+). The presence of free hydrogen ions (H+) lowers the pH of the ocean. 

==== Three pH scales in oceanography ====
The measurement of pH in seawater is complicated by the chemical properties of seawater, and three distinct pH scales exist in chemical oceanography. In practical terms, the three seawater pH scales differ in their pH values up to 0.10, differences that are much larger than the accuracy of pH measurements typically required, in particular, in relation to the ocean&#x27;s carbonate system. Since it omits consideration of sulfate and fluoride ions, the &quot;free scale&quot; is significantly different from both the total and seawater scales. Because of the relative unimportance of the fluoride ion, the total and seawater scales differ only very slightly.

As part of its operational definition of the pH scale, the IUPAC defines a series of Buffer solutions across a range of pH values (often denoted with National Bureau of Standards (NBS) or National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) designation). These solutions have a relatively low ionic strength (≈ 0.1) compared to that of seawater (≈ 0.7), and, as a consequence, are not recommended for use in characterizing the pH of seawater, since the ionic strength differences cause changes in electrode potential. To resolve this problem, an alternative series of buffers based on artificial seawater was developed. This new series resolves the problem of ionic strength differences between samples and the buffers, and the new pH scale is referred to as the &quot;total scale&quot;, often denoted as pHT. The total scale was defined using a medium containing sulfate ions. These ions experience protonation, + , such that the total scale includes the effect of both protons (free hydrogen ions) and hydrogen sulfate ions:
: []T = []F + []

An alternative scale, the &quot;free scale&quot;, often denoted pHF, omits this consideration and focuses solely on []F, in principle making it a simpler representation of hydrogen ion concentration. Only []T can be determined, therefore []F must be estimated using the [] and the stability constant of , :
: []F = []T − [] = []T ( 1 + [] / &quot;K&quot; )−1

However, it is difficult to estimate &quot;K&quot; in seawater, limiting the utility of the otherwise more straightforward free scale.

Another scale, known as the &quot;seawater scale&quot;, often denoted pHSWS, takes account of a further protonation relationship between hydrogen ions and fluoride ions, + ⇌ HF. Resulting in the following expression for []SWS:
: []SWS = []F + [] + [HF]

However, the advantage of considering this additional complexity is dependent upon the abundance of fluoride in the medium. In seawater, for instance, sulfate ions occur at much greater concentrations (&gt; 400 times) than those of fluoride. As a consequence, for most practical purposes, the difference between the total and seawater scales is very small.

The following three equations summarize the three scales of pH:
: pHF = −log10[]F
: pHT = −log10([]F + []) = −log10[]T
: pHSWS = −log10(]F + [] + [HF]) = −log10[v]SWS

=== pH in food ===
The pH level of food influences its flavor, texture, and shelf life. Acidic foods, such as citrus fruits, tomatoes, and vinegar, typically have a pH below 4.6 with sharp and tangy taste, while basic foods taste bitter or soapy. Maintaining the appropriate pH in foods is essential for preventing the growth of harmful microorganisms. The alkalinity of vegetables such as spinach and kale can also influence their texture and color during cooking. The pH also influences the Maillard reaction, which is responsible for the browning of food during cooking, impacting both flavor and appearance.

=== pH of various body fluids ===

In living organisms, the pH of various Body fluids, cellular compartments, and organs is tightly regulated to maintain a state of acid-base balance known as acid–base homeostasis. Acidosis, defined by blood pH below 7.35, is the most common disorder of acid–base homeostasis and occurs when there is an excess of acid in the body. In contrast, alkalosis is characterized by excessively high blood pH.

Blood pH is usually slightly alkaline, with a pH of 7.365, referred to as physiological pH in biology and medicine. Plaque formation in teeth can create a local acidic environment that results in tooth decay through demineralization. Enzymes and other Proteins have an optimal pH range for function and can become inactivated or denatured outside this range.

== pH calculations ==
When calculating the pH of a solution containing acids and/or bases, a chemical speciation calculation is used to determine the concentration of all chemical species present in the solution. The complexity of the procedure depends on the nature of the solution. Strong acids and bases are compounds that are almost completely dissociated in water, which simplifies the calculation. However, for weak acids, a quadratic equation must be solved, and for weak bases, a cubic equation is required. In general, a set of non-linear simultaneous equations must be solved.

Water itself is a weak acid and a weak base, so its dissociation must be taken into account at high pH and low solute concentration (see &quot;Amphoterism&quot;). It dissociates according to the equilibrium
with a dissociation constant, defined as
: formula_11
where [H+] stands for the concentration of the aqueous hydronium ion and [OH−] represents the concentration of the hydroxide ion. This equilibrium needs to be taken into account at high pH and when the solute concentration is extremely low.

=== Strong acids and bases ===
Strong acids and bases are compounds that are essentially fully dissociated in water. This means that in an acidic solution, the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) can be considered equal to the concentration of the acid. Similarly, in a basic solution, the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH-) can be considered equal to the concentration of the base. The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of H+, and the pOH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of OH−. For example, the pH of a 0.01 in moles per litreM solution of hydrochloric acid (HCl) is equal to 2 (pH = −log10(0.01)), while the pOH of a 0.01 M solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is equal to 2 (pOH = −log10(0.01)), which corresponds to a pH of about 12.

However, self-ionization of water must also be considered when concentrations of a strong acid or base is very low or high. For instance, a solution of HCl would be expected to have a pH of 7.3 based on the above procedure, which is incorrect as it is acidic and should have a pH of less than 7. In such cases, the system can be treated as a mixture of the acid or base and water, which is an amphoteric substance. By accounting for the self-ionization of water, the true pH of the solution can be calculated. For example, a solution of HCl would have a pH of 6.89 when treated as a mixture of HCl and water. The self-ionization equilibrium of solutions of sodium hydroxide at higher concentrations must also be considered.

=== Weak acids and bases ===
A weak acid or the conjugate acid of a weak base can be treated using the same formalism.
* Acid HA: 
* Base A: 
First, an acid dissociation constant is defined as follows. Electrical charges are omitted from subsequent equations for the sake of generality
: formula_12
and its value is assumed to have been determined by experiment. This being so, there are three unknown concentrations, [HA], [H+] and [A−] to determine by calculation. Two additional equations are needed. One way to provide them is to apply the law of mass conservation in terms of the two &quot;reagents&quot; H and A.
: formula_13
: formula_14

&quot;C&quot; stands for analytical concentration. In some texts, one mass balance equation is replaced by an equation of charge balance. This is satisfactory for simple cases like this one, but is more difficult to apply to more complicated cases as those below. Together with the equation defining &quot;K&quot;a, there are now three equations in three unknowns. When an acid is dissolved in water &quot;C&quot;A = &quot;C&quot;H = &quot;C&quot;a, the concentration of the acid, so [A] = [H]. After some further algebraic manipulation an equation in the hydrogen ion concentration may be obtained.
: formula_15

Solution of this quadratic equation gives the hydrogen ion concentration and hence p[H] or, more loosely, pH. This procedure is illustrated in an ICE table which can also be used to calculate the pH when some additional (strong) acid or alkaline has been added to the system, that is, when &quot;C&quot;A ≠ &quot;C&quot;H.

For example, what is the pH of a 0.01 M solution of benzoic acid, p&quot;K&quot;a = 4.19?
* Step 1: formula_16
* Step 2: Set up the quadratic equation. formula_17
* Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation. formula_18

For alkaline solutions, an additional term is added to the mass-balance equation for hydrogen. Since the addition of hydroxide reduces the hydrogen ion concentration, and the hydroxide ion concentration is constrained by the self-ionization equilibrium to be equal to formula_19, the resulting equation is:
: formula_20

=== General method ===
Some systems, such as with polyprotic acids, are amenable to spreadsheet calculations. With three or more reagents or when many complexes are formed with general formulae such as ApBqHr, the following general method can be used to calculate the pH of a solution. For example, with three reagents, each equilibrium is characterized by an equilibrium constant, &quot;β&quot;.
: formula_21

Next, write down the mass-balance equations for each reagent:
: formula_22

There are no approximations involved in these equations, except that each stability constant is defined as a quotient of concentrations, not activities. Much more complicated expressions are required if activities are to be used.

There are three simultaneous equations in the three unknowns, [A], [B] and [H]. Because the equations are non-linear and their concentrations may range over many powers of 10, the solution of these equations is not straightforward. However, many computer programs are available which can be used to perform these calculations. There may be more than three reagents. The calculation of hydrogen ion concentrations, using this approach, is a key element in the determination of equilibrium constants by potentiometric titration.

<text>A pastel () is an art medium that consist of powdered pigment and a binder. It can exist in a variety of forms, including a stick, a square, a pebble, and a pan of color, among other forms. The pigments used in pastels are similar to those used to produce some other colored visual arts media, such as oil paints; the binder is of a neutral hue and low saturation. The color effect of pastels is closer to the natural dry pigments than that of any other process.

Pastels have been used by artists since the Renaissance, and gained considerable popularity in the 18th century, when a number of notable artists made pastel their primary medium.

An artwork made using pastels is called a pastel (or a pastel drawing or pastel painting). &quot;Pastel&quot; used as a verb means to produce an artwork with pastels; as an adjective it means pale in color.

==Pastel media==
Pastel sticks or crayons consist of powdered pigment combined with a binder. The exact composition and characteristics of an individual pastel stick depend on the type of pastel and the type and amount of binder used. It also varies by individual manufacturer.

Dry pastels have historically used binders such as gum arabic and gum tragacanth. Methyl cellulose was introduced as a binder in the 20th century. Often a chalk or gypsum component is present. They are available in varying degrees of hardness, the softer varieties being wrapped in paper. Some pastel brands use pumice in the binder to abrade the paper and create more tooth.

Dry pastel media can be subdivided as follows:
* &quot;Soft pastels&quot;: This is the most widely used form of pastel. The sticks have a higher portion of pigment and less binder. The drawing can be readily smudged and blended, but it results in a higher proportion of dust. Finished drawings made with soft pastels require protecting, either framing under glass or spraying with a fixative to prevent smudging, although fixatives may affect the color or texture of the drawing. While possible, it is not recommended to use hair spray as fixative, as it might not be pH neutral and it might contain non-archival ingredients. White chalk may be used as a filler in producing pale and bright hues with greater luminosity.
* &quot;Pan pastels&quot;: These are formulated with a minimum of binder in flat compacts (similar to some makeup) and applied with special soft micropore sponge tools. No liquid is involved. A 21st century invention, pan pastels can be used for the entire painting or in combination with soft and hard sticks.
* &quot;Hard pastels&quot;: These have a higher portion of binder and less pigment, producing a sharp drawing material that is useful for fine details. These can be used with other pastels for drawing outlines and adding accents. Hard pastels are traditionally used to create the preliminary sketching out of a composition. However, the colors are less brilliant and are available in a restricted range in contrast to soft pastels.
* &quot;Pastel pencils&quot;: These are pencils with a pastel lead. They are useful for adding fine details.

In addition, pastels using a different approach to manufacture have been developed:
* &quot;Oil pastels&quot;: These have a soft, buttery consistency and intense colors. They are dense and fill the grain of paper and are slightly more difficult to blend than soft pastels, but do not require a fixative. They may be spread across the work surface by thinning with turpentine.
* &quot;Water-soluble pastels&quot;: These are similar to soft pastels, but contain a water-soluble component, such as polyethylene glycol. This allows the colors to be thinned out to an even, semi-transparent consistency using a water wash. Water-soluble pastels are made in a restricted range of hues in strong colors. They have the advantages of enabling easy blending and mixing of the hues, given their fluidity, as well as allowing a range of color tint effects depending upon the amount of water applied with a brush to the working surface.

There has been some debate within art societies as to what exactly qualifies as a pastel. The Pastel Society within the UK (the oldest pastel society) states the following are acceptable media for its exhibitions: &quot;Pastels, including Oil pastel, Charcoal, Pencil, Conté, Sanguine, or any dry media&quot;. The emphasis appears to be on &quot;dry media&quot; but the debate continues.

==Manufacture==
In order to create hard and soft pastels, pigments are ground into a paste with water and a gum binder and then rolled, pressed or extruded into sticks. The name &quot;pastel&quot; is derived from Medieval Latin &quot;woad paste,&quot; from Late Latin &quot;paste.&quot; The French word &quot;pastel&quot; first appeared in 1662.

Most brands produce gradations of a color, the original pigment of which tends to be dark, from pure pigment to near-white by mixing in differing quantities of chalk. This mixing of pigments with chalks is the origin of the word &quot;pastel&quot; in reference to pale color as it is commonly used in cosmetic and fashion contexts.

A pastel is made by letting the sticks move over an abrasive ground, leaving color on the grain of the painting surface. When fully covered with pastel, the work is called a pastel &quot;painting&quot;; when not, a pastel &quot;sketch&quot; or &quot;drawing&quot;. Pastel paintings, being made with a medium that has the highest pigment concentration of all, reflect light without darkening refraction, allowing for very saturated colors.

==Pastel supports==
Pastel supports need to provide a &quot;tooth&quot; for the pastel to adhere and hold the pigment in place. Supports include:

* laid paper (e.g. Ingres, Canson Mi Teintes)
* abrasive supports (e.g. with a surface of finely ground pumice, marble dust, or rottenstone)
* velour paper (e.g. Hannemühle Pastellpapier Velour) suitable for use with soft pastels is a composite of synthetic fibers attached to acid-free backing

==Protection of pastel paintings==

Pastels can be used to produce a permanent painting if the artist meets appropriate archival considerations. This means:

* Only pastels with lightfast pigments are used. As it is not protected by a binder the pigment in pastels is especially vulnerable to light. Pastel paintings made with pigments that change color or tone when exposed to light suffer comparable problems to gouache paintings using the same pigments.
* Works are done on an acid-free archival quality support. Historically some works have been executed on supports which are now extremely fragile and the support rather than the pigment needs to be protected under glass and away from light.
* Works are properly mounted and framed under glass so that the glass does not touch the artwork. This prevents the deterioration which is associated with environmental hazards such as air quality, humidity, mildew problems associated with condensation and smudging. Plexiglas is not used as it will create static electricity and dislodge the particles of pastel pigment.
* Some artists protect their finished pieces by spraying them with a fixative. A pastel fixative is an aerosol varnish which can be used to help stabilize the small charcoal or pastel particles on a painting or drawing. It cannot prevent smearing entirely without dulling and darkening the bright and fresh colors of pastels. The use of hairspray as a fixative is generally not recommended as it is not acid-free and therefore can degrade the artwork in the long term. Traditional fixatives will discolor eventually.

For these reasons, some pastelists avoid the use of a fixative except in cases where the pastel has been overworked so much that the surface will no longer hold any more pastel. The fixative will restore the &quot;tooth&quot; and more pastel can be applied on top. It is the tooth of the painting surface that holds the pastels, not a fixative. Abrasive supports avoid or minimize the need to apply further fixative in this way. SpectraFix, a modern casein fixative available premixed in a pump misting bottle or as concentrate to be mixed with alcohol, is not toxic and does not darken or dull pastel colors. However, SpectraFix takes some practice to use because it&#x27;s applied with a pump misting bottle instead of an aerosol spray can. It is easy to use too much SpectraFix and leave puddles of liquid that may dissolve passages of color; also it takes a little longer to dry than conventional spray fixatives between light layers.

Glassine (paper) is used by artists to protect artwork which is being stored or transported. Some good quality books of pastel papers also include glassine to separate pages.

==Techniques==

Pastel techniques can be challenging since the medium is mixed and blended directly on the working surface, and unlike paint, colors cannot be tested on a palette before applying to the surface. Pastel errors cannot be covered the way a paint error can be painted out. Experimentation with the pastel medium on a small scale in order to learn various techniques gives the user a better command over a larger composition.

Pastels have some techniques in common with painting, such as blending, masking, building up layers of color, adding accents and highlighting, and shading. Some techniques are characteristic of both pastels and sketching mediums such as charcoal and lead, for example, hatching and crosshatching, and gradation. Other techniques are particular to the pastel medium.

* Colored grounds: the use of a colored working surface to produce an effect such as a softening of the pastel hues, or a contrast
* Dry wash: coverage of a large area using the broad side of the pastel stick. A cotton ball, paper towel, or brush may be used to spread the pigment more thinly and evenly.
* Erasure: lifting of pigment from an area using a kneaded eraser or other tool
* Feathering
* Frottage
* Impasto: pastel applied thickly enough to produce a discernible texture or relief
* Pouncing
* Resist techniques
* Scraping out
* Scumbling
* Sfumato
* Sgraffito
* Stippling
* Textured grounds: the use of coarse or smooth paper texture to create an effect, a technique also often used in watercolor painting
* Wet brushing

==Health and safety hazards==
Pastels are a dry medium and produce a great deal of dust, which can cause respiratory irritation. More seriously, pastels might use the same pigments as artists&#x27; paints, many of which are toxic. For example, exposure to cadmium pigments, which are common and popular bright yellows, oranges, and reds, can lead to cadmium poisoning. Pastel artists, who use the pigments without a strong painting binder, are especially susceptible to such poisoning. For this reason, many modern pastels are made using substitutions for cadmium, chromium, and other toxic pigments, while retaining the traditional pigment names. All brands that have the AP Label by ASTM International are not considered toxic, and they might use extremely insoluble varieties of cadmium or cobalt pigments that will not be readily absorbed by the human body. Although less toxic when swallowed, they should still be treated with care.

==Pastel art in art history==
The manufacture of pastels originated in the 15th century. The pastel medium was mentioned by Leonardo da Vinci, who learned of it from the French artist Jean Perréal after that artist&#x27;s arrival in Milan in 1499. Pastel was sometimes used as a medium for preparatory studies by 16th-century artists, notably Federico Barocci. The first French artist to specialize in pastel portraits was Joseph Vivien.

During the 18th century the medium became fashionable for portrait painting, sometimes in a mixed technique with gouache. Pastel was an important medium for artists such as Jean-Baptiste Perronneau, Maurice Quentin de La Tour (who never painted in oils), and Rosalba Carriera. The pastel still life paintings and portraits of Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin are much admired, as are the works of the Swiss-French artist Jean-Étienne Liotard. In 18th-century England the outstanding practitioner was John Russell. In Colonial America, John Singleton Copley used pastel occasionally for portraits.

In France, pastel briefly became unpopular during and after the Revolution, as the medium was identified with the frivolity of the Ancien Régime. By the mid-19th century, French artists such as Eugène Delacroix and especially Jean-François Millet were again making significant use of pastel. Their countryman Édouard Manet painted a number of portraits in pastel on canvas, an unconventional ground for the medium. Edgar Degas was an innovator in pastel technique, and used it with an almost expressionist vigor after about 1885, when it became his primary medium. Odilon Redon produced a large body of works in pastel.

James Abbott McNeill Whistler produced a quantity of pastels around 1880, including a body of work relating to Venice, and this probably contributed to a growing enthusiasm for the medium in the United States. In particular, he demonstrated how few strokes were required to evoke a place or an atmosphere. Mary Cassatt, an American artist active in France, introduced the Impressionists and pastel to her friends in Philadelphia and Washington.

According to the Metropolitan Museum of Art&#x27;s &quot;Time Line of Art History: Nineteenth Century American Drawings&quot;: 

On the East Coast of the United States, the Society of Painters in Pastel was founded in 1883 by William Merritt Chase, Robert Blum, and others. The Pastellists, led by Leon Dabo, was organized in New York in late 1910 and included among its ranks Everett Shinn and Arthur Bowen Davies. On the American West Coast the influential artist and teacher Pedro Joseph de Lemos, who served as Chief Administrator of the San Francisco Art Institute and Director of the Stanford University Museum and Art Gallery, popularized pastels in regional exhibitions. Beginning in 1919 de Lemos published a series of articles on &quot;painting&quot; with pastels, which included such notable innovations as allowing the intensity of light on the subject to determine the distinct color of laid paper and the use of special optics for making &quot;night sketches&quot; in both urban and rural settings. His night scenes, which were often called &quot;dreamscapes&quot; in the press, were influenced by French Symbolism, and especially Odilon Redon.

Pastels have been favored by many modern and contemporary artists because of the medium&#x27;s broad range of bright colors. Recent notable artists who have worked extensively in pastels include Fernando Botero, Francesco Clemente, Daniel Greene, Wolf Kahn, Paula Rego and R. B. Kitaj.

<text>Pen pals (or penpals, pen-pals, penfriends or pen friends) are people who regularly write to each other, particularly via postal mail. Pen pals are usually strangers whose relationship is based primarily, or even solely, on their exchange of letters. Occasionally, pen pals may already have a relationship that is not regularly conducted in person.

==Purposes==
A pen pal relationship is often used to practice reading and writing in a foreign language, to improve literacy, to learn more about other countries and lifestyles, and to make friendships. While the expansion of the Internet has reduced the number of traditional pen pals, pen pal clubs can nowadays be found on the Internet, in magazine columns, newspapers, and sometimes through clubs or special interest groups. Sometimes pen pals are used in schools.

==Organizations==
Many pen pals meet each other through organizations that bring people together for this purpose.

Organizations can be split into three main categories: free, partial subscription, and subscription-based clubs. Free clubs are usually funded by advertising and profiles are not reviewed, whereas subscription-based clubs will usually not contain any advertising and will have an administrator approving profiles to the database.

While the traditional snail mail pen pal relationship has fallen into a decline due to modern technology closing the world&#x27;s communication gap, prison pen pal services have combined technology with traditional letter writing. These sites allow prisoners to place pen pal ads online; however, inmates in the United States and most of the world are not permitted to access the Internet. Therefore, the pen pal relationships with inmates are still conducted via postal mail. Other pen pal organizations have survived by embracing the technology of the Internet.

==In popular culture==
The Australian author Geraldine Brooks wrote a memoir entitled &quot;Foreign Correspondence&quot; (1997), about her childhood which was enriched by her exchanges of letters with other children in Australia and overseas, and her travels as an adult in search of the people they had become.

In the 1970s, the syndicated children&#x27;s television program &quot;Big Blue Marble&quot; often invited viewers to write to them for their own pen pal.

On another children&#x27;s TV show, &quot;Pee-wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, Pee-wee Herman would often receive pen pal letters.

In the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip from the 1960s and 1970s, Charlie Brown tries to write to a pen pal using a fountain pen, but after several literally &quot;botched&quot; attempts, Charlie switches to using a pencil and referring to his penpal as his &quot;pencil-pal&quot;; his first letter to his &quot;pencil-pal&quot; explains the reason for the name change. In the animated feature film adaptation, &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot;, this hobby enables the story to have a happy ending with Charlie Brown to have an active friendship with his dream girl, the Little Red-Haired Girl, in a way that he feels comfortable without significantly affecting the franchise&#x27;s story world.

The Bollywood film &quot;Romance&quot; (1983) is about two people, Amar (from India) and Sonia (from the UK) who fall in love after becoming pen pals. The Bollywood film &quot;Sirf Tum&quot; (1999) has a similar storyline.

The film &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot; (1998) is a romantic comedy about two people in a pen pal email courtship who are unaware that they are also business rivals.

The action-drama film &quot;Out of Reach&quot; (2004) is about a pen pal relationship between a Vietnam War veteran and a 13-year-old orphaned girl from Poland. When the letters suddenly stop coming, the veteran heads to Poland to find out the reason.

The film &quot;A Cinderella Story&quot; (2004) is a teen romantic comedy about two people in a pen pal email courtship who plan to meet in person at their high school&#x27;s Halloween dance.

The claymation film &quot;Mary and Max&quot; (2009) is about the pen pal relationship between an American man and an Australian girl.

In the 2012 film &quot;Moonrise Kingdom&quot; the characters Suzy and Sam become pen pals.

Musicians Jetty Rae and Heath McNease have collaborated under the moniker &quot;Pen Pals&quot;.

<text>Philip Glass (born January 31, 1937) is an American composer and pianist. He is widely regarded as one of the most influential composers of the late 20th century. Glass&#x27;s work has been associated with minimalism, being built up from repetitive phrases and shifting layers. Glass describes himself as a composer of &quot;music with repetitive structures&quot;, which he has helped to evolve stylistically.

He founded the Philip Glass Ensemble, which is still in existence, but Glass no longer performs with the ensemble. He has written 15 operas, numerous chamber operas and musical theatre works, 14 symphonies, 12 concertos, nine string quartets, various other chamber music pieces, and many film scores. He has received nominations for four Grammy Awards for including two for Best Contemporary Classical Composition for &quot;Satyagraha&quot; (1987) and &quot;String Quartet No. 2&quot; (1988). He has received three Academy Award for Best Original Score nominations for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Kundun&quot; (1997), Stephen Daldry&#x27;s &quot;The Hours&quot; (2002), and Richard Eyre&#x27;s &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot; (2006). He also composed the scores for &quot;&quot; (1985), &quot;Hamburger Hill&quot; (1987), &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; (1988), &quot;Candyman&quot; (1992), &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998), and &quot;The Illusionist&quot; (2006).

Glass is known for composing several operas such as &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; (1976), &quot;Satyagraha&quot; (1980), &quot;Akhnaten&quot; (1983), &quot;The Voyage&quot; (1992), and &quot;The Perfect American&quot; (2013). He also wrote the scores for Broadway productions such as the revivals of &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (2002), &quot;The Crucible&quot; (2016), and &quot;King Lear&quot; (2019). For the latter he won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music in a Play.

Over his career Glass has received several awards including a BAFTA Award, a Drama Desk Award, and a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for three Academy Awards, four Grammy Awards, and a Primetime Emmy Award. He has also received the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1995, the National Medal of Arts in 2010, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2018, and the Grammy Trustees Award in 2020.

==Early life and education==
Glass was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on January 31, 1937, the son of Ida (née Gouline) and Benjamin Charles Glass. His family were Latvian-Jewish and Russian-Jewish emigrants. His father owned a record store and his mother was a librarian. In his memoir, Glass recalls that at the end of World War II his mother aided Jewish Holocaust survivors, inviting recent arrivals to America to stay at their home until they could find a job and a place to live. She developed a plan to help them learn English and develop skills so they could find work. His sister, Sheppie, would later do similar work as an active member of the International Rescue Committee.

Glass developed his appreciation of music from his father, discovering later that his father&#x27;s side of the family had many musicians. His cousin Cevia was a classical pianist, while others had been in vaudeville. He learned his family was also related to Al Jolson. Glass&#x27;s father often received promotional copies of new recordings at his music store. Glass spent many hours listening to them, developing his knowledge of and taste in music. This openness to modern sounds affected Glass at an early age:

The elder Glass promoted both new recordings and a wide selection of composers to his customers, sometimes convincing them to try something new by allowing them to return records they did not like. His store soon developed a reputation as Baltimore&#x27;s leading source of modern music. Glass built a sizable record collection from the unsold records in his father&#x27;s store, including modern classical music such as Hindemith, Bartók, Schoenberg, Shostakovich and Western classical music including Beethoven&#x27;s string quartets and Schubert&#x27;s B Piano Trio. Glass cites Schubert&#x27;s work as a &quot;big influence&quot; growing up. In a 2011 interview, Glass stated that Franz Schubert—with whom he shares a birthday—is his favorite composer.

He studied the flute as a child at the Peabody Preparatory of the Peabody Institute of Music. At the age of 15, he entered an accelerated college program at the University of Chicago where he studied mathematics and philosophy. In Chicago, he discovered the serialism of Anton Webern and composed a twelve-tone string trio. In 1954, Glass traveled to Paris, where he encountered the films of Jean Cocteau, which made a lasting impression on him. He visited artists&#x27; studios and saw their work; Glass recalls, &quot;the bohemian life you see in [Cocteau&#x27;s] &quot;Orphée&quot; was the life I ... was attracted to, and those were the people I hung out with.&quot;

Glass studied at the Juilliard School of Music where the keyboard was his main instrument. His composition teachers included Vincent Persichetti and William Bergsma. Fellow students included Steve Reich and Peter Schickele. In 1959, he was a winner in the BMI Foundation&#x27;s BMI Student Composer Awards, an international prize for young composers. In the summer of 1960, he studied with Darius Milhaud at the summer school of the Aspen Music Festival and composed a violin concerto for a fellow student, Dorothy Pixley-Rothschild. After leaving Juilliard in 1962, Glass moved to Pittsburgh and worked as a school-based composer-in-residence in the public school system, composing various choral, chamber, and orchestral music.

==Career==
===1964–1966: Paris===

In 1964, Glass received a Fulbright Scholarship; his studies in Paris with the eminent composition teacher Nadia Boulanger, from autumn of 1964 to summer of 1966, influenced his work throughout his life, as the composer admitted in 1979: &quot;The composers I studied with Boulanger are the people I still think about most—Bach and Mozart.&quot;

Glass later wrote in his autobiography &quot;Music by Philip Glass&quot; in 1987 that the new music performed at Pierre Boulez&#x27;s &quot;Domaine Musical&quot; concerts in Paris lacked any excitement for him (with the notable exceptions of music by John Cage and Morton Feldman), but he was deeply impressed by new films and theatre performances. His move away from modernist composers such as Boulez and Stockhausen was nuanced, rather than outright rejection: &quot;That generation wanted disciples and as we didn&#x27;t join up it was taken to mean that we hated the music, which wasn&#x27;t true. We&#x27;d studied them at Juilliard and knew their music. How on earth can you reject Berio? Those early works of Stockhausen are still beautiful. But there was just no point in attempting to do their music better than they did and so we started somewhere else.&quot;

During this time, he encountered revolutionary films of the French New Wave, such as those of Jean-Luc Godard and François Truffaut, which upended the rules set by an older generation of artists, and Glass made friends with American visual artists (the sculptor Richard Serra and his wife Nancy Graves), actors and directors (JoAnne Akalaitis, Ruth Maleczech, David Warrilow, and Lee Breuer, with whom Glass later founded the experimental theatre group Mabou Mines). Together with Akalaitis (they married in 1965), Glass in turn attended performances by theatre groups including Jean-Louis Barrault&#x27;s Odéon theatre, The Living Theatre and the Berliner Ensemble in 1964 to 1965. These significant encounters resulted in a collaboration with Breuer for which Glass contributed music for a 1965 staging of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Comédie&quot; (&quot;Play&quot;, 1963). The resulting piece (written for two soprano saxophones) was directly influenced by the play&#x27;s open-ended, repetitive and almost musical structure and was the first one of a series of four early pieces in a minimalist, yet still dissonant, idiom. After &quot;Play&quot;, Glass also acted in 1966 as music director of a Breuer production of Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot;, featuring the theatre score by Paul Dessau.

In parallel with his early excursions in experimental theatre, Glass worked in winter 1965 and spring 1966 as a music director and composer on a film score (&quot;Chappaqua&quot;, Conrad Rooks, 1966) with Ravi Shankar and Alla Rakha, which added another important influence on Glass&#x27;s musical thinking. His distinctive style arose from his work with Shankar and Rakha and their perception of rhythm in Indian music as being entirely additive. He renounced all his compositions in a moderately modern style resembling Milhaud&#x27;s, Aaron Copland&#x27;s, and Samuel Barber&#x27;s, and began writing pieces based on repetitive structures of Indian music and a sense of time influenced by Samuel Beckett: a piece for two actresses and chamber ensemble, a work for chamber ensemble and his first numbered string quartet (No. 1, 1966).

Glass then left Paris for northern India in 1966, where he came in contact with Tibetan refugees and began to gravitate towards Buddhism. He met Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, in 1972, and has been a strong supporter of the Tibetan independence ever since.

===1967–1974: Minimalism: From &quot;Strung Out&quot; to &quot;Music in 12 Parts&quot;===


Shortly after arriving in New York City in March 1967, Glass attended a performance of works by Steve Reich (including the ground-breaking minimalist piece &quot;Piano Phase&quot;), which left a deep impression on him; he simplified his style and turned to a radical &quot;consonant vocabulary&quot;. Finding little sympathy from traditional performers and performance spaces, Glass eventually formed an ensemble with fellow ex-student Jon Gibson, and others, and began performing mainly in art galleries and studio lofts of SoHo. The visual artist Richard Serra provided Glass with Gallery contacts, while both collaborated on various sculptures, films and installations; from 1971 to 1974, he was Serra&#x27;s regular studio assistant.

Between summer of 1967 and the end of 1968, Glass composed nine works, including &quot;Strung Out&quot; (for amplified solo violin, composed in summer of 1967), &quot;Gradus&quot; (for solo saxophone, 1968), &quot;Music in the Shape of a Square&quot; (for two flutes, composed in May 1968, an homage to Erik Satie), &quot;How Now&quot; (for solo piano, 1968) and &quot;1+1&quot; (for amplified tabletop, November 1968) which were &quot;clearly designed to experiment more fully with his new-found minimalist approach&quot;. The first concert of Glass&#x27;s new music was at Jonas Mekas&#x27;s Film-Makers Cinemathèque (Anthology Film Archives) in September 1968. This concert included the first work of this series with &quot;Strung Out&quot; (performed by the violinist Pixley-Rothschild) and &quot;Music in the Shape of a Square&quot; (performed by Glass and Gibson). The musical scores were tacked on the wall, and the performers had to move while playing. Glass&#x27;s new works met with a very enthusiastic response by the audience which consisted mainly of visual and performance artists who were highly sympathetic to Glass&#x27;s reductive approach.

Apart from his music career, Glass had a moving company with his cousin, the sculptor Jene Highstein, and also worked as a plumber and cab driver (during 1973 to 1978). He recounts installing a dishwasher and looking up from his work to see an astonished Robert Hughes, &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s art critic, staring at him. During this time, he made friends with other New York-based artists such as Sol LeWitt, Nancy Graves, Michael Snow, Bruce Nauman, Laurie Anderson, and Chuck Close (who created a now-famous portrait of Glass). (Glass returned the compliment in 2005 with &quot;A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close&quot; for piano.)

With &quot;1+1&quot; and &quot;Two Pages&quot; (composed in February 1969), Glass turned to a more &quot;rigorous approach&quot; to his &quot;most basic minimalist technique, additive process&quot;, pieces which were followed in the same year by &quot;Music in Contrary Motion&quot; and &quot;Music in Fifths&quot; (a kind of homage to his composition teacher Nadia Boulanger, who pointed out &quot;hidden fifths&quot; in his works but regarded them as cardinal sins). Eventually Glass&#x27;s music grew less austere, becoming more complex and dramatic, with pieces such as &quot;Music in Similar Motion&quot; (1969), and &quot;Music with Changing Parts&quot; (1970). These pieces were performed by the Philip Glass Ensemble in the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1969 and in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1970, often encountering hostile reaction from critics, but Glass&#x27;s music was also met with enthusiasm from younger artists such as Brian Eno and David Bowie (at the Royal College of Art ca. 1970). Eno described this encounter with Glass&#x27;s music as one of the &quot;most extraordinary musical experiences of [his] life&quot;, as a &quot;viscous bath of pure, thick energy&quot;, concluding &quot;this was actually the most detailed music I&#x27;d ever heard. It was all intricacy, exotic harmonics&quot;. In 1970, Glass returned to the theatre, composing music for the theatre group Mabou Mines, resulting in his first minimalist pieces employing voices: &quot;Red Horse Animation&quot; and &quot;Music for Voices&quot; (both 1970, and premiered at the Paula Cooper Gallery).

After differences of opinion with Steve Reich in 1971, Glass formed the Philip Glass Ensemble (while Reich formed Steve Reich and Musicians), an amplified ensemble including keyboards, wind instruments (saxophones, flutes), and soprano voices.

Glass&#x27;s music for his ensemble culminated in the four-hour-long &quot;Music in Twelve Parts&quot; (1971–1974), which began as a single piece with twelve instrumental parts but developed into a cycle that summed up Glass&#x27;s musical achievement since 1967, and even transcended it—the last part features a twelve-tone theme, sung by the soprano voice of the ensemble. &quot;I had broken the rules of modernism and so I thought it was time to break some of my own rules&quot;, according to Glass. Though he finds the term minimalist inaccurate to describe his later work, Glass does accept this term for pieces up to and including &quot;Music in 12 Parts&quot;, excepting this last part which &quot;was the end of minimalism&quot; for Glass. As he pointed out: &quot;I had worked for eight or nine years inventing a system, and now I&#x27;d written through it and come out the other end.&quot; He now prefers to describe himself as a composer of &quot;music with repetitive structures&quot;.

===1975–1979: Another Look at Harmony: The Portrait Trilogy===
Glass continued his work with a series of instrumental works, called &quot;Another Look at Harmony&quot; (1975–1977). For Glass, this series demonstrated a new start, hence the title: &quot;What I was looking for was a way of combining harmonic progression with the rhythmic structure I had been developing, to produce a new overall structure. ... I&#x27;d taken everything out with my early works and it was now time to decide just what I wanted to put in—a process that would occupy me for several years to come.&quot;

Parts 1 and 2 of &quot;Another Look at Harmony&quot; were included in a collaboration with Robert Wilson, a piece of musical theater later designated by Glass as the first opera of his portrait opera trilogy: &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;. Composed in spring to fall of 1975 in close collaboration with Wilson, Glass&#x27;s first opera was first premiered in summer 1976 at the Festival d&#x27;Avignon, and in November of the same year to a mixed and partly enthusiastic reaction from the audience at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. Scored for the Philip Glass Ensemble, solo violin, chorus, and featuring actors (reciting texts by Christopher Knowles, Lucinda Childs and Samuel M. Johnson), Glass&#x27;s and Wilson&#x27;s essentially plotless opera was conceived as a &quot;metaphorical look at Albert Einstein: scientist, humanist, amateur musician—and the man whose theories ... led to the splitting of the atom&quot;, evoking nuclear holocaust in the climactic scene, as critic Tim Page pointed out. As with &quot;Another Look at Harmony&quot;, &quot;&quot;Einstein&quot; added a new functional harmony that set it apart from the early conceptual works&quot;. Composer Tom Johnson came to the same conclusion, comparing the solo violin music to Johann Sebastian Bach, and the &quot;organ figures ... to those Alberti basses Mozart loved so much&quot;. The piece was praised by &quot;The Washington Post&quot; as &quot;one of the seminal artworks of the century&quot;.

&quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; was followed by further music for projects by the theatre group Mabou Mines such as &quot;Dressed like an Egg&quot; (1975), and again music for plays and adaptations from prose by Samuel Beckett, such as &quot;The Lost Ones&quot; (1975), &quot;Cascando&quot; (1975), &quot;Mercier and Camier&quot; (1979). Glass also turned to other media; two multi-movement instrumental works for the Philip Glass Ensemble originated as music for film and TV: &quot;North Star&quot; (1977 score for the documentary &quot;North Star: Mark di Suvero&quot; by François de Menil and Barbara Rose) and four short cues for the children&#x27;s TV series &quot;Sesame Street&quot; named &quot;Geometry of Circles&quot; (1979).

Another series, &quot;Fourth Series&quot; (1977–79), included music for chorus and organ (&quot;Part One&quot;, 1977), organ and piano (&quot;Part Two&quot; and &quot;Part Four&quot;, 1979), and music for a radio adaption of Constance DeJong&#x27;s novel &quot;Modern Love&quot; (&quot;Part Three&quot;, 1978). &quot;Part Two&quot; and &quot;Part Four&quot; were used (and hence renamed) in two dance productions by choreographer Lucinda Childs (who had already contributed to and performed in &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;). &quot;Part Two&quot; was included in &quot;Dance&quot; (a collaboration with visual artist Sol LeWitt, 1979), and &quot;Part Four&quot; was renamed as &quot;Mad Rush&quot;, and performed by Glass on several occasions such as the first public appearance of the 14th Dalai Lama in New York City in fall 1981. The piece demonstrates Glass&#x27;s turn to more traditional models: the composer added a conclusion to an open-structured piece which &quot;can be interpreted as a sign that he [had] abandoned the radical non-narrative, undramatic approaches of his early period&quot;, as the pianist Steffen Schleiermacher points out.

In spring 1978, Glass received a commission from the Netherlands Opera (as well as a Rockefeller Foundation grant) which &quot;marked the end of his need to earn money from non-musical employment&quot;. With the commission Glass continued his work in music theater, composing his opera &quot;Satyagraha&quot; (composed in 1978–1979, premiered in 1980 at Rotterdam), based on the early life of Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa, Leo Tolstoy, Rabindranath Tagore, and Martin Luther King Jr. For &quot;Satyagraha&quot;, Glass worked in close collaboration with two &quot;SoHo friends&quot;: the writer Constance deJong, who provided the libretto, and the set designer Robert Israel. This piece was in other ways a turning point for Glass, as it was his first work since 1963 scored for symphony orchestra, even if the most prominent parts were still reserved for solo voices and chorus. Shortly after completing the score in August 1979, Glass met the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, whom he helped prepare for performances in Germany (using a piano-four-hands version of the score); together they started to plan another opera, to be premiered at the Stuttgart State Opera.

===1980–1986: Completing the Portrait Trilogy: &quot;Akhnaten&quot; and beyond===

While planning a third part of his &quot;Portrait Trilogy&quot;, Glass turned to smaller music theatre projects such as the non-narrative &quot;Madrigal Opera&quot; (for six voices and violin and viola, 1980), and &quot;The Photographer&quot;, a biographic study on the photographer Eadweard Muybridge (1982). Glass also continued to write for the orchestra with the score of &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot; (Godfrey Reggio, 1981–1982). Some pieces which were not used in the film (such as &quot;Façades&quot;) eventually appeared on the album &quot;Glassworks&quot; (1982, CBS Records), which brought Glass&#x27;s music to a wider public.

The &quot;Portrait Trilogy&quot; was completed with &quot;Akhnaten&quot; (1982–1983, premiered in 1984), a vocal and orchestral composition sung in Akkadian, Biblical Hebrew, and Ancient Egyptian. In addition, this opera featured an actor reciting ancient Egyptian texts in the language of the audience. &quot;Akhnaten&quot; was commissioned by the Stuttgart Opera in a production designed by Achim Freyer. It premiered simultaneously at the Houston Opera in a production directed by David Freeman and designed by Peter Sellars. At the time of the commission, the Stuttgart Opera House was undergoing renovation, necessitating the use of a nearby playhouse with a smaller orchestra pit. Upon learning this, Glass and conductor Dennis Russell Davies visited the playhouse, placing music stands around the pit to determine how many players the pit could accommodate. The two found they could not fit a full orchestra in the pit. Glass decided to eliminate the violins, which had the effect of &quot;giving the orchestra a low, dark sound that came to characterize the piece and suited the subject very well&quot;. As Glass remarked in 1992, &quot;Akhnaten&quot; is significant in his work since it represents a &quot;first extension out of a triadic harmonic language&quot;, an experiment with the polytonality of his teachers Persichetti and Milhaud, a musical technique which Glass compares to &quot;an optical illusion, such as in the paintings of Josef Albers&quot;.

Glass again collaborated with Robert Wilson on another opera, &quot;the CIVIL warS&quot; (1983, premiered in 1984), which also functioned as the final part (the Rome section) of Wilson&#x27;s epic work by the same name, originally planned for an &quot;international arts festival that would accompany the Olympic Games in Los Angeles&quot;. (Glass also composed a prestigious work for chorus and orchestra for the opening of the Games, &quot;The Olympian: Lighting of the Torch and Closing &quot;). The premiere of &quot;The CIVIL warS&quot; in Los Angeles never materialized and the opera was in the end premiered at the Opera of Rome. Glass&#x27;s and Wilson&#x27;s opera includes musical settings of Latin texts by the 1st-century-Roman playwright Seneca and allusions to the music of Giuseppe Verdi and from the American Civil War, featuring the 19th century figures Giuseppe Garibaldi and Robert E. Lee as characters.

In the mid-1980s, Glass produced &quot;works in different media at an extraordinarily rapid pace&quot;. Projects from that period include music for dance (Glass Pieces choreographed for New York City Ballet by Jerome Robbins in 1983 to a score drawn from existing Glass compositions created for other media including an excerpt from &quot;Akhnaten&quot;; and &quot;In the Upper Room&quot;, Twyla Tharp, 1986), music for theatre productions &quot;Endgame&quot; (1984) and &quot;Company&quot; (1983). Beckett vehemently disapproved of the production of &quot;Endgame&quot; at the American Repertory Theater (Cambridge, Massachusetts), which featured JoAnne Akalaitis&#x27;s direction and Glass&#x27;s &quot;Prelude&quot; for timpani and double bass, but in the end, he authorized the music for &quot;Company&quot;, four short, intimate pieces for string quartet that were played in the intervals of the dramatization. This composition was initially regarded by the composer as a piece of Gebrauchsmusik (&#x27;music for use&#x27;)—&quot;like salt and pepper ... just something for the table&quot;, as he noted. Eventually &quot;Company&quot; was published as Glass&#x27;s String Quartet No. 2 and in a version for string orchestra, being performed by ensembles ranging from student orchestras to renowned formations such as the Kronos Quartet and the Kremerata Baltica.

This interest in writing for the string quartet and the string orchestra led to a chamber and orchestral film score for &quot;&quot; (Paul Schrader, 1984–85), which Glass recently described as his &quot;musical turning point&quot; that developed his &quot;technique of film scoring in a very special way&quot;.

Glass also dedicated himself to vocal works with two sets of songs, &quot;Three Songs for chorus&quot; (1984, settings of poems by Leonard Cohen, Octavio Paz and Raymond Lévesque), and a song cycle initiated by CBS Masterworks Records: &quot;Songs from Liquid Days&quot; (1985), with texts by songwriters such as David Byrne, Paul Simon, in which the Kronos Quartet is featured (as it is in &quot;Mishima&quot;) in a prominent role. Glass also continued his series of operas with adaptations from literary texts such as &quot;The Juniper Tree&quot; (an opera collaboration with composer Robert Moran, 1984), Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; (1987), and also worked with novelist Doris Lessing on the opera &quot;The Making of the Representative for Planet 8&quot; (1985–86, and performed by the Houston Grand Opera and English National Opera in 1988).

===1987–1991: Operas and the turn to symphonic music===
Compositions such as &quot;Company&quot;, &quot;Facades&quot; and String Quartet No. 3 (the last two extracted from the scores to &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot; and &quot;Mishima&quot;) gave way to a series of works more accessible to ensembles such as the string quartet and symphony orchestra, in this returning to the structural roots of his student days. In taking this direction his chamber and orchestral works were also written in a more and more traditional and lyrical style. In these works, Glass often employs old musical forms such as the chaconne and the passacaglia—for instance in &quot;Satyagraha&quot;, the Violin Concerto No. 1 (1987), Symphony No. 3 (1995), &quot;Echorus&quot; (1995) and also recent works such as Symphony No. 8 (2005), and &quot;Songs and Poems for Solo Cello&quot; (2006).

A series of orchestral works originally composed for the concert hall commenced with the three-movement Violin Concerto No. 1 (1987). This work was commissioned by the American Composers Orchestra and written for and in close collaboration with the violinist Paul Zukofsky and the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, who since then has encouraged the composer to write numerous orchestral pieces. The Concerto is dedicated to the memory of Glass&#x27;s father: &quot;His favorite form was the violin concerto, and so I grew up listening to the Mendelssohn, the Paganini, the Brahms concertos. ... So when I decided to write a violin concerto, I wanted to write one that my father would have liked.&quot; Among its multiple recordings, in 1992, the Concerto was performed and recorded by Gidon Kremer and the Vienna Philharmonic. This turn to orchestral music was continued with a symphonic trilogy of &quot;portraits of nature&quot;, commissioned by the Cleveland Orchestra, the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra: &quot;The Light&quot; (1987), &quot;The Canyon&quot; (1988), and &quot;Itaipu&quot; (1989).

While composing for symphonic ensembles, Glass also composed music for piano, with the cycle of five movements titled &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; (adapted from music for a theatrical adaptation of Franz Kafka&#x27;s &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot;), and for the Errol Morris film &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;, 1988. In the same year Glass met the poet Allen Ginsberg by chance in a book store in the East Village of New York City, and they immediately &quot;decided on the spot to do something together, reached for one of Allen&#x27;s books and chose &quot;Wichita Vortex Sutra&quot;&quot;, a piece for reciter and piano which in turn developed into a music theatre piece for singers and ensemble, &quot;Hydrogen Jukebox&quot; (1990).

Glass also returned to chamber music; he composed two String Quartets (No. 4 &quot;Buczak&quot; in 1989 and No. 5 in 1991), and chamber works which originated as incidental music for plays, such as &quot;Music from &quot;The Screens&quot;&quot; (1989/1990). This work originated in one of many theater music collaborations with the director JoAnne Akalaitis, who originally asked the Gambian musician Foday Musa Suso &quot;to do the score [for Jean Genet&#x27;s &quot;The Screens&quot;] in collaboration with a western composer&quot;. Glass had already collaborated with Suso in the film score to &quot;Powaqqatsi&quot; (Godfrey Reggio, 1988). &quot;Music from &quot;The Screens&quot;&quot; is on occasion a touring piece for Glass and Suso (one set of tours also included percussionist Yousif Sheronick ), and individual pieces found their way into the repertoire of Glass and the cellist Wendy Sutter. Another collaboration was a collaborative recording project with Ravi Shankar, initiated by Peter Baumann (a member of the band Tangerine Dream), which resulted in the album &quot;Passages&quot; (1990).

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Glass&#x27;s projects also included two highly prestigious opera commissions based on the life of explorers: &quot;The Voyage&quot; (1992), with a libretto by David Henry Hwang, was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera for the 500th anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher Columbus; and &quot;White Raven&quot; (1991), about Vasco da Gama, a collaboration with Robert Wilson and composed for the closure of the 1998 World Fair in Lisbon. Especially in &quot;The Voyage&quot;, the composer &quot;explore[d] new territory&quot;, with its &quot;newly arching lyricism&quot;, &quot;Sibelian starkness and sweep&quot;, and &quot;dark, brooding tone ... a reflection of its increasingly chromatic (and dissonant) palette&quot;, as one commentator put it.

Glass remixed the S&#x27;Express song &quot;Hey Music Lover&quot;, for the b-side of its 1989 release as a single.

===1991–1996: Cocteau trilogy and symphonies===

After these operas, Glass began working on a symphonic cycle, commissioned by the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, who told Glass at the time: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to let you ... be one of those opera composers who never write a symphony&quot;. Glass responded with a pair of three-movement symphonies (&quot;&quot;Low&quot;&quot; [1992], and Symphony No. 2 [1994]); his first in an ongoing series of symphonies is a combination of the composer&#x27;s own musical material with themes featured in prominent tracks of the David Bowie/Brian Eno album &quot;Low&quot; (1977), whereas Symphony No. 2 is described by Glass as a study in polytonality. He referred to the music of Honegger, Milhaud, and Villa-Lobos as possible models for his symphony. With the Concerto Grosso (1992), Symphony No. 3 (1995), a Concerto for Saxophone Quartet and Orchestra (1995), written for the Rascher Quartet (all commissioned by conductor Dennis Russell Davies), and &quot;Echorus&quot; (1994/95), a more transparent, refined, and intimate chamber-orchestral style paralleled the excursions of his large-scale symphonic pieces. In the four movements of his Third Symphony, Glass treats a 19-piece string orchestra as an extended chamber ensemble. In the third movement, Glass re-uses the chaconne as a formal device; one commentator characterized Glass&#x27;s symphony as one of the composer&#x27;s &quot;most tautly unified works&quot;. The third Symphony was closely followed by a fourth, subtitled &quot;Heroes&quot; (1996), commissioned the American Composers Orchestra. Its six movements are symphonic reworkings of themes by Glass, David Bowie, and Brian Eno (from their album &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot;, 1977); as in other works by the composer, it is also a hybrid work and exists in two versions: one for the concert hall, and another, shorter one for dance, choreographed by Twyla Tharp.

Another commission by Dennis Russell Davies was a second series for piano, the &quot;Etudes&quot; for Piano (dedicated to Davies as well as the production designer Achim Freyer); the complete first set of ten Etudes has been recorded and performed by Glass himself. Bruce Brubaker and Dennis Russell Davies have each recorded the original set of six. Most of the Etudes are composed in the post-minimalist and increasingly lyrical style of the times: &quot;Within the framework of a concise form, Glass explores possible sonorities ranging from typically Baroque passagework to Romantically tinged moods&quot;. Some of the pieces also appeared in different versions such as in the theatre music to Robert Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Persephone&quot; (1994, commissioned by the Relache Ensemble) or &quot;Echorus&quot; (a version of Etude No. 2 for two violins and string orchestra, written for Edna Mitchell and Yehudi Menuhin 1995).

Glass&#x27;s prolific output in the 1990s continued to include operas with an opera triptych (1991–1996), which the composer described as an &quot;homage&quot; to writer and film director Jean Cocteau, based on his prose and cinematic work: &quot;Orphée&quot; (1950), &quot;La Belle et la Bête&quot; (1946), and the novel &quot;Les Enfants terribles&quot; (1929, later made into a film by Cocteau and Jean-Pierre Melville, 1950). In the same way the triptych is also a musical homage to the work of the group of French composers associated with Cocteau, Les Six (and especially to Glass&#x27;s teacher Darius Milhaud), as well as to various 18th-century composers such as Gluck and Bach whose music featured as an essential part of the films by Cocteau.

The inspiration of the first part of the trilogy, &quot;Orphée&quot; (composed in 1991, and premiered in 1993 at the American Repertory Theatre) can be conceptually and musically traced to Gluck&#x27;s opera &quot;Orfeo ed Euridice&quot; (&quot;Orphée et Euridyce&quot;, 1762/1774), which had a prominent part in Cocteau&#x27;s 1949 film &quot;Orphee&quot;. One theme of the opera, the death of Eurydice, has some similarity to the composer&#x27;s personal life: the opera was composed after the unexpected death in 1991 of Glass&#x27;s wife, artist Candy Jernigan: &quot;... One can only suspect that Orpheus&#x27; grief must have resembled the composer&#x27;s own&quot;, K. Robert Schwartz suggests. The opera&#x27;s &quot;transparency of texture, a subtlety of instrumental color, ... a newly expressive and unfettered vocal writing&quot; was praised, and &quot;The Guardian&#x27;s&quot; critic remarked &quot;Glass has a real affinity for the French text and sets the words eloquently, underpinning them with delicately patterned instrumental textures&quot;.

For the second opera, &quot;La Belle et la Bête&quot; (1994, scored for either the Philip Glass Ensemble or a more conventional chamber orchestra), Glass replaced the soundtrack (including Georges Auric&#x27;s film music) of Cocteau&#x27;s film, wrote &quot;a new fully operatic score and synchronize[d] it with the film&quot;. This reimagining of a score took what had been common in turning opera into film and turned it on its head, turning film into opera. This brought the music that would otherwise be subordinate to the film to the forefront so that the two were equal with each other; taking a new spin on an old tradition. The final part of the triptych returned again to a more traditional setting with the &quot;Dance Opera&quot; &quot;Les Enfants terribles&quot; (1996), scored for voices, three pianos and dancers, with choreography by Susan Marshall. The characters are depicted by both singers and dancers. The scoring of the opera evokes Bach&#x27;s Concerto for Four Harpsichords, but in another way also &quot;the snow, which falls relentlessly throughout the opera ... bearing witness to the unfolding events. Here time stands still. There is only music, and the movement of children through space&quot; (Glass).

===1997–2004: Symphonies, opera, and concertos===
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Glass&#x27;s lyrical and romantic styles peaked with a variety of projects: operas, theatre and film scores (Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Kundun&quot;, 1997, Godfrey Reggio&#x27;s &quot;Naqoyqatsi&quot;, 2002, and Stephen Daldry&#x27;s &quot;The Hours&quot;, 2002), a series of five concerts, and three symphonies centered on orchestra-singer and orchestra-chorus interplay. Two symphonies, Symphony No. 5 &quot;Choral&quot; (1999) and Symphony No. 7 &quot;Toltec&quot; (2004), and the song cycle &quot;Songs of Milarepa&quot; (1997) have a meditative theme. The operatic Symphony No. 6 &quot;Plutonian Ode&quot; (2002) for soprano and orchestra was commissioned by the Brucknerhaus, Linz, and Carnegie Hall in celebration of Glass&#x27;s sixty-fifth birthday, and developed from Glass&#x27;s collaboration with Allen Ginsberg (poet, piano—Ginsberg, Glass), based on his poem of the same name.

Besides writing for the concert hall, Glass continued his ongoing operatic series with adaptions from literary texts: &quot;The Marriages of Zones 3, 4 and 5&quot; ([1997] story-libretto by Doris Lessing), &quot;In the Penal Colony&quot; (2000, after the story by Franz Kafka), and the chamber opera &quot;The Sound of a Voice&quot; (2003, with David Henry Hwang), which features the Pipa, performed by Wu Man at its premiere. Glass also collaborated again with the co-author of &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot;, Robert Wilson, on &quot;Monsters of Grace&quot; (1998), and created a biographic opera on the life of astronomer Galileo Galilei (2001).

In the early 2000s, Glass started a series of five concerti with the &quot;Tirol Concerto for Piano and Orchestra&quot; (2000, premiered by Dennis Russell Davies as conductor and soloist), and the &quot;Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra&quot; (2000, for the timpanist Jonathan Haas). The Concerto for Cello and Orchestra (2001) had its premiere performance in Beijing, featuring cellist Julian Lloyd Webber; it was composed in celebration of his fiftieth birthday. These concertos were followed by the concise and rigorously neo-Baroque Concerto for Harpsichord and Orchestra (2002), demonstrating in its transparent, chamber orchestral textures Glass&#x27;s classical technique, evocative in the &quot;improvisatory chords&quot; of its beginning a toccata of Froberger or Frescobaldi, and 18th century music. Two years later, the concerti series continued with &quot;Piano Concerto No. 2: After Lewis and Clark&quot; (2004), composed for the pianist Paul Barnes. The concerto celebrates the pioneers&#x27; trek across North America, and the second movement features a duet for piano and Native American flute. With the chamber opera &quot;The Sound of a Voice&quot;, Glass&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 2 might be regarded as bridging his traditional compositions and his more popular excursions to World Music, also found in &quot;Orion&quot; (also composed in 2004).

===2005–2007: &quot;Songs and Poems&quot;===

&quot;Waiting for the Barbarians&quot;, an opera from J. M. Coetzee&#x27;s novel (with the libretto by Christopher Hampton), had its premiere performance in September 2005. Glass defined the work as a &quot;social/political opera&quot;, as a critique on the Bush administration&#x27;s war in Iraq, a &quot;dialogue about political crisis&quot;, and an illustration of the &quot;power of art to turn our attention toward the human dimension of history&quot;. While the opera&#x27;s themes are Imperialism, apartheid, and torture, the composer chose an understated approach by using &quot;very simple means, and the orchestration is very clear and very traditional; it&#x27;s almost classical in sound&quot;, as the conductor Dennis Russell Davies notes.

Two months after the premiere of this opera, in November 2005, Glass&#x27;s Symphony No. 8, commissioned by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz, was premiered at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City. After three symphonies for voices and orchestra, this piece was a return to purely orchestral and abstract composition; like previous works written for the conductor Dennis Russell Davies (the 1992 Concerto Grosso and the 1995 Symphony No. 3), it features extended solo writing. Critic Allan Kozinn described the symphony&#x27;s chromaticism as more extreme, more fluid, and its themes and textures as continually changing, morphing without repetition, and praised the symphony&#x27;s &quot;unpredictable orchestration&quot;, pointing out the &quot;beautiful flute and harp variation in the melancholy second movement&quot;. Alex Ross, remarked that &quot;against all odds, this work succeeds in adding something certifiably new to the overstuffed annals of the classical symphony. ... The musical material is cut from familiar fabric, but it&#x27;s striking that the composer forgoes the expected bustling conclusion and instead delves into a mood of deepening twilight and unending night.&quot;

&quot;The Passion of Ramakrishna&quot; (2006), was composed for the Pacific Symphony orchestra, the Pacific Chorale and the conductor Carl St. Clair. The 45 minutes choral work is based on the writings of Indian spiritual leader Ramakrishna, which seem &quot;to have genuinely inspired and revived the composer out of his old formulas to write something fresh&quot;, as one critic remarked, whereas another noted &quot;The musical style breaks little new ground for Glass, except for the glorious Handelian ending ... the composer&#x27;s style ideally fits the devotional text&quot;.

A cello suite, composed for the cellist Wendy Sutter, &quot;Songs and Poems for Solo Cello&quot; (2005–2007), was equally lauded by critics. It was described by Lisa Hirsch as &quot;a major work, ... a major addition to the cello repertory&quot; and &quot;deeply Romantic in spirit, and at the same time deeply Baroque&quot;. Another critic, Anne Midgette of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, noted the suite &quot;maintains an unusual degree of directness and warmth&quot;; she also noted a kinship to a major work by Johann Sebastian Bach: &quot;Digging into the lower registers of the instrument, it takes flight in handfuls of notes, now gentle, now impassioned, variously evoking the minor-mode keening of klezmer music and the interior meditations of Bach&#x27;s cello suites&quot;. Glass himself pointed out &quot;in many ways it owes more to Schubert than to Bach&quot;.

In 2007, Glass also worked alongside Leonard Cohen on an adaptation of Cohen&#x27;s poetry collection &quot;Book of Longing&quot;. The work, which premiered in June 2007 in Toronto, is a piece for seven instruments and a vocal quartet, and contains recorded spoken word performances by Cohen and imagery from his collection.

&quot;Appomattox&quot;, an opera surrounding the events at the end of the American Civil War, was commissioned by the San Francisco Opera and premiered on October 5, 2007. As in &quot;Waiting for the Barbarians&quot;, Glass collaborated with the writer Christopher Hampton, and as with the preceding opera and Symphony No. 8, the piece was conducted by Glass&#x27;s long-time collaborator Dennis Russell Davies, who noted &quot;in his recent operas the bass line has taken on an increasing prominence... (an) increasing use of melodic elements in the deep register, in the contrabass, the contrabassoon—he&#x27;s increasingly using these sounds and these textures can be derived from using these instruments in different combinations. ... He&#x27;s definitely developed more skill as an orchestrator, in his ability to conceive melodies and harmonic structures for specific instrumental groups. ... what he gives them to play is very organic and idiomatic.&quot;

Apart from this large-scale opera, Glass added a work to his catalogue of theater music in 2007, and continuing—after a gap of twenty years—to write music for the dramatic work of Samuel Beckett. He provided a &quot;hypnotic&quot; original score for a compilation of Beckett&#x27;s short plays &quot;Act Without Words I&quot;, &quot;Act Without Words II&quot;, &quot;Rough for Theatre I&quot; and &quot;Eh Joe&quot;, directed by JoAnne Akalaitis and premiered in December 2007. Glass&#x27;s work for this production was described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;icy, repetitive music that comes closest to piercing the heart&quot;.

===2008–present: Chamber music, concertos, and symphonies===

Between 2008 and 2010, Glass continued to work on a series of chamber music pieces which started with &quot;Songs and Poems&quot;: the &quot;Four Movements for Two Pianos&quot; (2008, premiered by Dennis Russell Davies and Maki Namekawa in July 2008), a &quot;Sonata for Violin and Piano&quot; composed in &quot;the Brahms tradition&quot; (completed in 2008, premiered by violinist Maria Bachman and pianist Jon Klibonoff in February 2009); a &quot;String sextet&quot; (an adaption of the Symphony No. 3 of 1995 made by Glass&#x27;s musical director Michael Riesman) followed in 2009. &quot;Pendulum&quot; (2010, a one-movement piece for violin and piano), a second Suite of cello pieces for Wendy Sutter (2011), and &quot;Partita for solo violin&quot; for violinist Tim Fain (2010, first performance of the complete work 2011), are recent entries in the series.

Other works for the theater were a score for Euripides&#x27; &quot;The Bacchae&quot; (2009, directed by JoAnne Akalaitis), and &quot;Kepler&quot; (2009), yet another operatic biography of a scientist or explorer. The opera is based on the life of 17th century astronomer Johannes Kepler, against the background of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, with a libretto compiled from Kepler&#x27;s texts and poems by his contemporary Andreas Gryphius. It is Glass&#x27;s first opera in German, and was premiered by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz and Dennis Russell Davies in September 2009. LA Times critic Mark Swed and others described the work as &quot;oratorio-like&quot;; Swed pointed out the work is Glass&#x27;s &quot;most chromatic, complex, psychological score&quot; and &quot;the orchestra dominates ... I was struck by the muted, glowing colors, the character of many orchestral solos and the poignant emphasis on bass instruments&quot;.

In 2009 and 2010, Glass returned to the concerto genre. Violin Concerto No. 2 in four movements was commissioned by violinist Robert McDuffie, and subtitled &quot;The American Four Seasons&quot; (2009), as an homage to Vivaldi&#x27;s set of concertos &quot;The Four Seasons&quot;. It premiered in December 2009 by the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and was subsequently performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra in April 2010. The Double Concerto for Violin and Cello and Orchestra (2010) was composed for soloists Maria Bachmann and Wendy Sutter and also as a ballet score for the Nederlands Dans Theater. Other orchestral projects of 2010 are short orchestral scores for films; to a multimedia presentation based on the novel &quot;Icarus at the Edge of Time&quot; by theoretical physicist Brian Greene, which premiered on June 6, 2010, and the score for the Brazilian film &quot;Nosso Lar&quot; (released in Brazil on September 3, 2010). Glass also donated a short work, &quot;Brazil&quot;, to the video game &quot;Chime&quot;, which was released on February 3, 2010.

In August 2011, Glass presented a series of music, dance, and theater performances as part of the Days and Nights Festival. Along with the Philip Glass Ensemble, scheduled performers include Molissa Fenley and Dancers, John Moran with Saori Tsukada, as well as a screening of &quot;Dracula&quot; with Glass&#x27;s score.

Other works completed since 2010 include Symphony No. 9 (2010–2011), Symphony No. 10 (2012), Cello Concerto No. 2 (2012, based on the film score to &quot;Naqoyqatsi&quot;) as well as String Quartet No. 6 and No. 7. Glass&#x27;s Ninth Symphony was co-commissioned by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz, the American Composers Orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. The symphony&#x27;s first performance took place on January 1, 2012, at the Brucknerhaus in Linz, Austria (Dennis Russell Davies conducting the Bruckner Orchestra Linz); the American premiere was on January 31, 2012, (Glass&#x27;s 75th birthday), at Carnegie Hall (Dennis Russell Davies conducting the American Composers Orchestra), and the West Coast premiere with the Los Angeles Philharmonic under the baton of John Adams on April 5. Glass&#x27;s Tenth Symphony, written in five movements, was commissioned by the Orchestre français des jeunes for its 30th anniversary. The symphony&#x27;s first performance took place on August 9, 2012, at the Grand Théâtre de Provence in Aix-en-Provence under Dennis Russell Davies.
The opera &quot;The Perfect American&quot; was composed in 2011 to a commission from Teatro Real Madrid. The libretto is based on a book of the same name by Peter Stephan Jungk and covers the final months of the life of Walt Disney. The world premiere was at the Teatro Real, Madrid, on January 22, 2013, with British baritone Christopher Purves taking the role of Disney. The UK premiere took place on June 1, 2013, in a production by the English National Opera at the London Coliseum. The US premiere took place on March 12, 2017, in a production by Long Beach Opera.

His opera &quot;&quot;, based on a play by Austrian playwright and novelist Peter Handke, &quot;Die Spuren der Verirrten&quot; (2007), premiered at the Musiktheater Linz in April 2013, conducted by Dennis Russell Davies and directed by David Pountney.

On June 28, 2013, Glass&#x27;s piano piece &quot;Two Movements for Four Pianos&quot; was premiered at the Museum Kunstpalast, performed by Katia and Marielle Labèque, Maki Namekawa, and Dennis Russell Davies.

On January 17, 2014, Glass&#x27;s collaboration with Angélique Kidjo &quot;Ifé: Three Yorùbá Songs for Orchestra&quot; premiered at the Philharmonie Luxembourg.

In May 2015, Glass&#x27;s Double Concerto for Two Pianos was premiered by Katia and Marielle Labèque, Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic.

Glass published his memoir, &quot;Words Without Music&quot;, in 2015. His 11th symphony, commissioned by the Bruckner Orchestra Linz, the Istanbul International Music Festival, and the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, premiered on January 31, 2017, Glass&#x27;s 80th birthday, at Carnegie Hall, Dennis Russell Davies conducting the Bruckner Orchestra. On September 22, 2017, his Piano Concerto No. 3 was premiered by pianist Simone Dinnerstein with the strings of the chamber orchestra A Far Cry at Jordan Hall at the New England Conservatory of Music, Boston, Massachusetts. Glass&#x27; String Quartet No. 8 was premiered by the JACK Quartet at Centennial Concert Hall in Winnipeg, Canada on February 1, 2018. The work was commissioned by the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra New Music Festival, the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra, and Carnegie Hall.

Glass&#x27;s 12th symphony was premiered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic under John Adams at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles on January 10, 2019. Commissioned by the orchestra, the work is based on David Bowie&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Lodger&quot;, it completes Glass&#x27;s trilogy of symphonies based on Bowie&#x27;s Berlin Trilogy of albums.

In collaboration with stage auteur, performer and co-director (with Kirsty Housley) Phelim McDermott, Glass composed the score for the new work &quot;Tao of Glass&quot;, which premiered at the 2019 Manchester International Festival before touring to the 2020 Perth Festival.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Glass continued composing, with three major works for opera and symphony premiering in 2021 and 2022. Glass&#x27; opera &quot;Circus Days and Nights&quot; was commissioned by Cirkus Cirkor. The libretto by David Henry Hwang and Tilde Björfors is based on a book of poems by Robert Lax. The world premiere was at the Malmö Opera on May 29, 2021. Glass&#x27;s Symphony No. 14 was premiered by the LGT Young Soloists at the Royal College of Music in London on September 17, 2021. The work was commissioned by the orchestra. Glass&#x27;s Symphony No. 13 was premiered by the National Arts Centre Orchestra under Alexander Shelley at the Roy Thomson Hall in Toronto on March 30, 2022. Commissioned by the orchestra, the work was written as a tribute to Canadian journalist Peter Jennings.

On November 7, 2023, Glass and Artisan Books released &quot;Philip Glass Piano Etudes: The Complete Folios 1–20 &amp; Essays from Fellow Artists&quot; a nine-pound deluxe boxed set of Glass&#x27; piano etudes and &quot;Studies in Time: Essays on the Music of Philip Glass.&quot; 

==Influences and collaborations==
Glass describes himself as a &quot;classicist&quot;, pointing out he is trained in harmony and counterpoint and studied such composers as Franz Schubert, Johann Sebastian Bach, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart with Nadia Boulanger. Aside from composing in the Western classical tradition, his music has ties to rock, ambient music, electronic music, and world music. Early admirers of his minimalism include musicians Brian Eno and David Bowie. In the 1990s, Glass composed the aforementioned symphonies &quot;Low&quot; (1992) and &quot;Heroes&quot; (1996), thematically derived from the Bowie-Eno collaboration albums &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot; composed in late 1970s Berlin.

Glass has collaborated with recording artists such as Paul Simon, Suzanne Vega, Mick Jagger, Leonard Cohen, David Byrne, Uakti, Natalie Merchant, S&#x27;Express (Glass remixed their track &quot;Hey Music Lover&quot; in 1989) and Aphex Twin (yielding an orchestration of &quot;Icct Hedral&quot; in 1995 on the &quot;Donkey Rhubarb&quot; EP). Glass&#x27;s compositional influence extends to musicians such as Mike Oldfield (who included parts from Glass&#x27;s &quot;North Star&quot; in &quot;Platinum&quot;), and bands such as Tangerine Dream and Talking Heads. Glass and his sound designer Kurt Munkacsi produced the American post-punk/new wave band Polyrock (1978 to the mid-1980s), as well as the recording of John Moran&#x27;s &quot;The Manson Family (An Opera)&quot; in 1991, which featured punk legend Iggy Pop, and a second (unreleased) recording of Moran&#x27;s work featuring poet Allen Ginsberg.

Glass counts many artists among his friends and collaborators, including visual artists (Richard Serra, Chuck Close, Fredericka Foster), writers (Doris Lessing, David Henry Hwang, Allen Ginsberg), film and theatre directors (including Errol Morris, Robert Wilson, JoAnne Akalaitis, Godfrey Reggio, Paul Schrader, Martin Scorsese, Christopher Hampton, Bernard Rose, and many others), choreographers (Lucinda Childs, Jerome Robbins, Twyla Tharp), and musicians and composers (Ravi Shankar, David Byrne, the conductor Dennis Russell Davies, Foday Musa Suso, Laurie Anderson, Linda Ronstadt, Paul Simon, Pierce Turner, Joan La Barbara, Arthur Russell, David Bowie, Brian Eno, Roberto Carnevale, Patti Smith, Aphex Twin, Lisa Bielawa, Andrew Shapiro, John Moran, Bryce Dessner and Nico Muhly). Among recent collaborators are Glass&#x27;s fellow New Yorker Woody Allen and Stephen Colbert.

Glass had begun using the Farfisa portable organ out of convenience, and he has used it in concert. It is featured on several recordings including &quot;North Star&quot; and &quot;Dance Nos. 1–5&quot;.

==Music for film==
Glass has composed many film scores, starting with the orchestral score for &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot; (1982), and continuing with two biopics, &quot;&quot; (1985, resulting in the String Quartet No. 3) and &quot;Kundun&quot; (1997) about the Dalai Lama, for which he received his first Academy Award nomination. In 1968 he composed and conducted the score for director Harrison Engle&#x27;s minimalist comedy short, &quot;Railroaded,&quot; played by the Philip Glass Ensemble. This was one of his earliest film efforts.

The year after scoring &quot;Hamburger Hill&quot; (1987), Glass began a long collaboration with the filmmaker Errol Morris with his music for Morris&#x27;s celebrated documentaries, including &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot; (1988) and &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; (1991). He continued composing for the Qatsi trilogy with the scores for &quot;Powaqqatsi&quot; (1988) and &quot;Naqoyqatsi&quot; (2002). In 1995, he composed the theme for Reggio&#x27;s short independent film &quot;Evidence&quot;. He made a cameo appearance—briefly visible performing at the piano—in Peter Weir&#x27;s &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (1998), which uses music from &quot;Powaqqatsi&quot;, &quot;Anima Mundi&quot; and &quot;Mishima&quot;, as well as three original tracks by Glass. In the 1990s, he also composed scores for &quot;Bent&quot; (1997) and the supernatural horror film &quot;Candyman&quot; (1992) and its sequel, &quot;&quot; (1995), plus a film adaptation of Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Agent&quot; (1996).

In 1999, he finished a new soundtrack for the 1931 film &quot;Dracula&quot;. &quot;The Hours&quot; (2002) earned him a second Academy Award nomination. The circular, recurring nature of Glass&#x27; music has been praised for providing stability and contrast to frequent jumps across time and geography in the film&#x27;s narrative. In this way, the soundtrack has a distinctive personality, so much so that director Stephen Daldry believes Glass&#x27;s music serves as &quot;another stream of consciousness, another character&quot; in the film. &quot;The Hours&quot; was followed by another Morris documentary, &quot;The Fog of War&quot; (2003). In the mid-2000s Glass provided the scores to films such as &quot;Secret Window&quot; (2004), &quot;Neverwas&quot; (2005), &quot;The Illusionist&quot; and &quot;Notes on a Scandal&quot;, garnering his third Academy Award nomination for the latter. Glass&#x27;s most recent film scores include &quot;No Reservations&quot; (Glass makes a brief cameo in the film sitting at an outdoor café), &quot;Cassandra&#x27;s Dream&quot; (2007), &quot;Les Regrets&quot; (2009), &quot;Mr Nice&quot; (2010), the Brazilian film &quot;Nosso Lar&quot; (2010) and &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; (2015, in collaboration with Marco Beltrami). In 2009, Glass composed original theme music for &quot;Transcendent Man&quot;, about the life and ideas of Ray Kurzweil by filmmaker Barry Ptolemy.

In the 2000s, Glass&#x27;s work from the 1980s again became known to wider public through various media. In 2005, his Concerto for Violin and Orchestra (1987) was featured in the French film &quot;The Moustache&quot;, providing a tone intentionally incongruous to the banality of the movie&#x27;s plot. &quot;Metamorphosis: Metamorphosis One&quot; from &quot;Solo Piano&quot; (1989) was featured in the reimagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; in the episode &quot;Valley of Darkness&quot; and also in the final episode (&quot;return 0&quot;) of &quot;Person of Interest&quot;. In 2008, Rockstar Games released &quot;Grand Theft Auto IV&quot; featuring Glass&#x27;s &quot;Pruit Igoe&quot; (from &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;). &quot;Pruit Igoe&quot; and &quot;Prophecies&quot; (also from &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;) were used both in a trailer for &quot;Watchmen&quot; and in the film itself. &quot;Watchmen&quot; also included two other Glass pieces in the score: &quot;Something She Has To Do&quot; from &quot;The Hours&quot; and &quot;Protest&quot; from &quot;Satyagraha&quot;, act 2, scene 3. In 2013, Glass contributed a piano piece &quot;Duet&quot; to the Park Chan-wook film &quot;Stoker&quot; which is performed diegetically in the film. Glass contributed compositions to the feature documentary &quot;The General &amp; Me&quot; by filmmaker Tiana Alexandra-Silliphant, which was showcased at Glass&#x27;s &quot;Days and Nights Festival&quot; in 2017. In 2017, Glass scored the National Geographic Films documentary &quot;Jane&quot; (a documentary on the life of renowned British primatologist Jane Goodall).

Glass&#x27;s music was featured in two award-winning films by Russian director Andrey Zvyagintsev, &quot;Elena&quot; (2011) and &quot;Leviathan&quot; (2014).

For television, Glass composed the theme for &quot;Night Stalker&quot; (2005) and the soundtrack for &quot;Tales from the Loop&quot; (2020). Glass&#x27;s &quot;Confrontation and Rescue&quot; (from &quot;Satyagraha&quot;) was used in the ending of Season 3 Chapter 6 of &quot;Stranger Things&quot; (2019), whilst &quot;Window of Appearances&quot;, &quot;Akhnaten and Nefertiti&quot; (from &quot;Akhnaten&quot;) and &quot;Prophecies&quot; (from &quot;Koyaanisqatsi&quot;) were used in the finale of Season 4 Volume 1 (2022).

==Other business ventures==
===Record labels===

In 1970, Glass and Klaus Kertess (owner of the Bykert Gallery) formed a record label named &quot;Chatham Square Productions&quot; after the location of the studio of a Philip Glass Ensemble member Dick Landry. In 1993, Glass formed another record label, Point Music; in 1997, Point Music released &quot;Music for Airports&quot;, a live, instrumental version of Eno&#x27;s composition of the same name, by Bang on a Can All-Stars. In 2002, Glass and his producer Kurt Munkacsi and artist Don Christensen founded the Orange Mountain Music company, dedicated to &quot;establishing the recording legacy of Philip Glass&quot; and, to date, have released sixty albums of Glass&#x27;s music.

===Looking Glass Studios===
In 1992, Glass built his own recording studio in New York City and named it Looking Glass Studios. In addition to Glass&#x27; own recording projects, the studio hosted recording projects of notable artists including Beck, Bjork, Sheryl Crow, The Cure, Grace Jones, Lou Reed, and Roger Waters before its closure in February 2009.

==Personal life==

Glass lives in New York City and in Cape Breton in Nova Scotia. He has described himself as &quot;a Jewish-Taoist-Hindu-Toltec-Buddhist&quot; and is a supporter of the Tibetan independence movement. In 1987, he co-founded the Tibet House US with Columbia University professor Robert Thurman and the actor Richard Gere at the request of the 14th Dalai Lama. He&#x27;s also chair of the magazine &quot;&quot;. Glass is a vegetarian.

Glass has been married four times; he has four children and one granddaughter.

* His first marriage was to theater director JoAnne Akalaitis (m. 1965, div. 1980), with whom he has two children: Juliet (b. 1968) and Zachary (b. 1971).
* His second marriage was to Luba Burtyk (m. 1980), a physician.
* His third wife, the artist Candy Jernigan, died of liver cancer in 1991, aged 39. 
* Glass&#x27;s fourth marriage was to restaurant manager, Holly Critchlow (m. in 2001), whom he later divorced. They had two sons, Cameron (b. 2002) and Marlowe (b. 2003).

He was romantically involved with cellist Wendy Sutter for approximately five years. , his partner was Japanese-born dancer Saori Tsukada.

Glass is the first cousin once removed of Ira Glass, host of the radio show &quot;This American Life&quot;. Ira interviewed Glass onstage at Chicago&#x27;s Field Museum; this interview was broadcast on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Fresh Air&quot;. Ira interviewed Glass a second time at a fundraiser for St. Ann&#x27;s Warehouse; this interview was given away to public-radio listeners as a pledge-drive thank-you gift in 2010. Ira and Glass recorded a version of the composition Glass wrote to accompany his friend Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s poem &quot;Wichita Vortex Sutra&quot;. In 2014, &quot;This American Life&quot; broadcast a live performance at the Brooklyn Academy of Music that included the world premier of the opera &quot;Help&quot;, a short monodrama that Philip Glass wrote for the occasion.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Musical Opinion&quot; said, &quot;Philip Glass must be one of the most influential living composers.&quot; The National Endowment for the Arts, while noting that many of his operas have been produced by the world&#x27;s leading opera houses said, &quot;He is the first composer to win a wide, multigenerational audience in the opera house, the concert hall, the dance world, in film, and in popular music.&quot; &quot;Classical Music Review&quot; called his opera &quot;Akhnaten&quot; &quot;a musically sophisticated and imposing work&quot;. The New York &quot;Metropolitan Opera&quot;&#x27;s production of &quot;Akhnaten&quot; won the &quot;Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording&quot; in 2022.

Justin Davidson of &quot;New York&quot; magazine has criticized Glass, saying, &quot;Glass never had a good idea he didn&#x27;t flog to death: He repeats the haunting scale 30 mind-numbing times, until it&#x27;s long past time to go home.&quot; Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; criticized Glass&#x27;s score for &quot;The Hours&quot;, saying, &quot;This ultimately proves insufficient to lend meaning to their lives or profundity to a grim and uninvolving film, for which Philip Glass unwittingly provides the perfect score—tuneless, oppressive, droning, painfully self-important.&quot;

Michael White of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; described Glass&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 2 as being

<text>In genetics, the phenotype () is the set of observable characteristics or traits of an organism. The term covers the organism&#x27;s morphology (physical form and structure), its developmental processes, its biochemical and physiological properties, its behavior, and the products of behavior. An organism&#x27;s phenotype results from two basic factors: the expression of an organism&#x27;s genetic code (its genotype) and the influence of environmental factors. Both factors may interact, further affecting the phenotype. When two or more clearly different phenotypes exist in the same population of a species, the species is called polymorphic. A well-documented example of polymorphism is Labrador Retriever coloring; while the coat color depends on many genes, it is clearly seen in the environment as yellow, black, and brown. Richard Dawkins in 1978 and then again in his 1982 book &quot;The Extended Phenotype&quot; suggested that one can regard bird nests and other built structures such as caddisfly larva cases and beaver dams as &quot;extended phenotypes&quot;.

Wilhelm Johannsen proposed the genotype–phenotype distinction in 1911 to make clear the difference between an organism&#x27;s hereditary material and what that hereditary material produces. The distinction resembles that proposed by August Weismann (1834–1914), who distinguished between germ plasm (heredity) and somatic cells (the body). More recently, in &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot; (1976), Dawkins distinguished these concepts as replicators and vehicles.

==Definition==

Despite its seemingly straightforward definition, the concept of the phenotype has hidden subtleties. It may seem that anything dependent on the genotype is a phenotype, including molecules such as RNA and proteins. Most molecules and structures coded by the genetic material are not visible in the appearance of an organism, yet they are observable (for example by Western blotting) and are thus part of the phenotype; human blood groups are an example. It may seem that this goes beyond the original intentions of the concept with its focus on the (living) organism in itself. Either way, the term phenotype includes inherent traits or characteristics that are observable or traits that can be made visible by some technical procedure.

The term &quot;phenotype&quot; has sometimes been incorrectly used as a shorthand for the phenotypic difference between a mutant and its wild type, which would lead to the false statement that a
&quot;mutation has no phenotype&quot;.

Behaviors and their consequences are also phenotypes, since behaviors are observable characteristics. Behavioral phenotypes include cognitive, personality, and behavioral patterns. Some behavioral phenotypes may characterize psychiatric disorders or syndromes.

A phenome is the set of all traits expressed by a cell, tissue, organ, organism, or species. The term was first used by Davis in 1949, &quot;We here propose the name &quot;phenome&quot; for the sum total of extragenic, non-autoreproductive portions of the cell, whether cytoplasmic or nuclear. The phenome would be the material basis of the phenotype, just as the genome is the material basis of the genotype.&quot;

Although phenome has been in use for many years, the distinction between the use of phenome and phenotype is problematic. A proposed definition for both terms as the &quot;physical totality of all traits of an organism or of one of its subsystems&quot; was put forth by Mahner and Kary in 1997, who argue that although scientists tend to intuitively use these and related terms in a manner that does not impede research, the terms are not well defined and usage of the terms is not consistent.

Some usages of the term suggest that the phenome of a given organism is best understood as a kind of matrix of data representing physical manifestation of phenotype. For example, discussions led by A. Varki among those who had used the term up to 2003 suggested the following definition: &quot;The body of information describing an organism&#x27;s phenotypes, under the influences of genetic and environmental factors&quot;. Another team of researchers characterize &quot;the human phenome [as] a multidimensional search space with several neurobiological levels, spanning the proteome, cellular systems (e.g., signaling pathways), neural systems and cognitive and behavioural phenotypes.&quot;

Plant biologists have started to explore the phenome in the study of plant physiology.

In 2009, a research team demonstrated the feasibility of identifying genotype–phenotype associations using electronic health records (EHRs) linked to DNA biobanks. They called this method phenome-wide association study (PheWAS).

Inspired by the evolution from genotype to genome to pan-genome, a concept of exploring the relationship ultimately among pan-phenome, pan-genome, and pan-envirome was proposed in 2023.


==Phenotypic variation==

Phenotypic variation (due to underlying heritable genetic variation) is a fundamental prerequisite for evolution by natural selection. It is the living organism as a whole that contributes (or not) to the next generation, so natural selection affects the genetic structure of a population indirectly via the contribution of phenotypes. Without phenotypic variation, there would be no evolution by natural selection.

The interaction between genotype and phenotype has often been conceptualized by the following relationship:

:genotype (G) + environment (E) → phenotype (P)

A more nuanced version of the relationship is:

:genotype (G) + environment (E) + genotype &amp; environment interactions (GE) → phenotype (P)

Genotypes often have much flexibility in the modification and expression of phenotypes; in many organisms these phenotypes are very different under varying environmental conditions. The plant &quot;Hieracium umbellatum&quot; is found growing in two different habitats in Sweden. One habitat is rocky, sea-side cliffs, where the plants are bushy with broad leaves and expanded inflorescences; the other is among sand dunes where the plants grow prostrate with narrow leaves and compact inflorescences. These habitats alternate along the coast of Sweden and the habitat that the seeds of &quot;Hieracium umbellatum&quot; land in, determine the phenotype that grows.

An example of random variation in &quot;Drosophila&quot; flies is the number of ommatidia, which may vary (randomly) between left and right eyes in a single individual as much as they do between different genotypes overall, or between clones raised in different environments.

The concept of phenotype can be extended to variations below the level of the gene that affect an organism&#x27;s fitness. For example, silent mutations that do not change the corresponding amino acid sequence of a gene may change the frequency of guanine-cytosine base pairs (GC content). These base pairs have a higher thermal stability (&quot;melting point&quot;) than adenine-thymine, a property that might convey, among organisms living in high-temperature environments, a selective advantage on variants enriched in GC content.

===The extended phenotype===
Richard Dawkins described a phenotype that included all effects that a gene has on its surroundings, including other organisms, as an extended phenotype, arguing that &quot;An animal&#x27;s behavior tends to maximize the survival of the genes &#x27;for&#x27; that behavior, whether or not those genes happen to be in the body of the particular animal performing it.&quot; For instance, an organism such as a beaver modifies its environment by building a beaver dam; this can be considered an expression of its genes, just as its incisor teeth are—which it uses to modify its environment. Similarly, when a bird feeds a brood parasite such as a cuckoo, it is unwittingly extending its phenotype; and when genes in an orchid affect orchid bee behavior to increase pollination, or when genes in a peacock affect the copulatory decisions of peahens, again, the phenotype is being extended. Genes are, in Dawkins&#x27;s view, selected by their phenotypic effects.

Other biologists broadly agree that the extended phenotype concept is relevant, but consider that its role is largely explanatory, rather than assisting in the design of experimental tests.

== Genes and phenotypes ==

Phenotypes are determined by an interaction of genes and the environment, but the mechanism for each gene and phenotype is different. For instance, an albino phenotype may be caused by a mutation in the gene encoding tyrosinase which is a key enzyme in melanin formation. However, exposure to UV radiation can increase melanin production, hence the environment plays a role in this phenotype as well. For most complex phenotypes the precise genetic mechanism remains unknown. For instance, it is largely unclear how genes determine the shape of bones or the human ear.

Gene expression plays a crucial role in determining the phenotypes of organisms. The level of gene expression can affect the phenotype of an organism. For example, if a gene that codes for a particular enzyme is expressed at high levels, the organism may produce more of that enzyme and exhibit a particular trait as a result. On the other hand, if the gene is expressed at low levels, the organism may produce less of the enzyme and exhibit a different trait.

Gene expression is regulated at various levels and thus each level can affect certain phenotypes, including transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.

Changes in the levels of gene expression can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as environmental conditions, genetic variations, and epigenetic modifications. These modifications can be influenced by environmental factors such as diet, stress, and exposure to toxins, and can have a significant impact on an individual&#x27;s phenotype. Some phenotypes may be the result of changes in gene expression due to these factors, rather than changes in genotype. An experiment involving machine learning methods utilizing gene expressions measured from RNA sequencing found that they can contain enough signal to separate individuals in the context of phenotype prediction.

== Phenome and phenomics ==

Although a phenotype is the ensemble of observable characteristics displayed by an organism, the word &quot;phenome&quot; is sometimes used to refer to a collection of traits, while the simultaneous study of such a collection is referred to as &quot;phenomics&quot;. Phenomics is an important field of study because it can be used to figure out which genomic variants affect phenotypes which then can be used to explain things like health, disease, and evolutionary fitness. Phenomics forms a large part of the Human Genome Project.

Phenomics has applications in agriculture. For instance, genomic variations such as drought and heat resistance can be identified through phenomics to create more durable GMOs.

Phenomics may be a stepping stone towards personalized medicine, particularly drug therapy. Once the phenomic database has acquired enough data, a person&#x27;s phenomic information can be used to select specific drugs tailored to the individual.

==Large-scale phenotyping and genetic screens==
Large-scale genetic screens can identify the genes or mutations that affect the phenotype of an organism. Analyzing the phenotypes of mutant genes can also aid in determining gene function. Most genetic screens have used microorganisms, in which genes can be easily deleted. For instance, nearly all genes have been deleted in &quot;E. coli&quot; and many other bacteria, but also in several eukaryotic model organisms such as baker&#x27;s yeast and fission yeast. Among other discoveries, such studies have revealed lists of essential genes .

More recently, large-scale phenotypic screens have also been used in animals, e.g. to study lesser understood phenotypes such as behavior. In one screen, the role of mutations in mice were studied in areas such as learning and memory, circadian rhythmicity, vision, responses to stress and response to psychostimulants.

This experiment involved the progeny of mice treated with ENU, or N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, which is a potent mutagen that causes point mutations. The mice were phenotypically screened for alterations in the different behavioral domains in order to find the number of putative mutants (see table for details). Putative mutants are then tested for heritability in order to help determine the inheritance pattern as well as map out the mutations. Once they have been mapped out, cloned, and identified, it can be determined whether a mutation represents a new gene or not.

These experiments showed that mutations in the rhodopsin gene affected vision and can even cause retinal degeneration in mice. The same amino acid change causes human familial blindness, showing how phenotyping in animals can inform medical diagnostics and possibly therapy.

==Evolutionary origin of phenotype==
The RNA world is the hypothesized pre-cellular stage in the evolutionary history of life on earth, in which self-replicating RNA molecules proliferated prior to the evolution of DNA and proteins. The folded three-dimensional physical structure of the first RNA molecule that possessed ribozyme activity promoting replication while avoiding destruction would have been the first phenotype, and the nucleotide sequence of the first self-replicating RNA molecule would have been the original genotype.

<text>Photosynthesis ( ) is a system of biological processes by which photosynthetic organisms, such as most plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, convert light energy, typically from sunlight, into the chemical energy necessary to fuel their metabolism. 
&quot;Photosynthesis&quot; usually refers to oxygenic photosynthesis, a process that produces oxygen. Photosynthetic organisms store the chemical energy so produced within intracellular organic compounds (compounds containing carbon) like sugars, glycogen, cellulose and starches. To use this stored chemical energy, an organism&#x27;s cells metabolize the organic compounds through cellular respiration. Photosynthesis plays a critical role in producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and it supplies most of the biological energy necessary for complex life on Earth.

Some bacteria also perform anoxygenic photosynthesis, which uses bacteriochlorophyll to split hydrogen sulfide as a reductant instead of water, producing sulfur instead of oxygen. Archaea such as &quot;Halobacterium&quot; also perform a type of non-carbon-fixing anoxygenic photosynthesis, where the simpler photopigment retinal and its microbial rhodopsin derivatives are used to absorb green light and power proton pumps to directly synthesize adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the &quot;energy currency&quot; of cells. Such archaeal photosynthesis might have been the earliest form of photosynthesis that evolved on Earth, as far back as the Paleoarchean, preceding that of cyanobacteria (see Purple Earth hypothesis).

While the details may differ between species, the process always begins when light energy is absorbed by the reaction centers, proteins that contain photosynthetic pigments or chromophores. In plants, these pigments are chlorophylls (a porphyrin derivative that absorbs the red and blue spectrums of light, thus reflecting green) held inside chloroplasts, abundant in leaf cells. In bacteria, they are embedded in the plasma membrane. In these light-dependent reactions, some energy is used to strip electrons from suitable substances, such as water, producing oxygen gas. The hydrogen freed by the splitting of water is used in the creation of two important molecules that participate in energetic processes: reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and ATP.

In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, sugars are synthesized by a subsequent sequence of reactions called the Calvin cycle. In this process, atmospheric carbon dioxide is incorporated into already existing organic compounds, such as ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). Using the ATP and NADPH produced by the light-dependent reactions, the resulting compounds are then reduced and removed to form further carbohydrates, such as glucose. In other bacteria, different mechanisms like the reverse Krebs cycle are used to achieve the same end.

The first photosynthetic organisms probably evolved early in the evolutionary history of life using reducing agents such as hydrogen or hydrogen sulfide, rather than water, as sources of electrons. Cyanobacteria appeared later; the excess oxygen they produced contributed directly to the oxygenation of the Earth, which rendered the evolution of complex life possible. The average rate of energy captured by global photosynthesis is approximately 130 terawatts, which is about eight times the total power consumption of human civilization. Photosynthetic organisms also convert around 100–115 billion tons (91–104 Pg petagrams, or billions of metric tons), of carbon into biomass per year. Photosynthesis was discovered in 1779 by Jan Ingenhousz who showed that plants need light, not just soil and water.

==Overview==
Most photosynthetic organisms are photoautotrophs, which means that they are able to synthesize food directly from carbon dioxide and water using energy from light. However, not all organisms use carbon dioxide as a source of carbon atoms to carry out photosynthesis; photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon.

In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen. This oxygenic photosynthesis is by far the most common type of photosynthesis used by living organisms. Some shade-loving plants (sciophytes) produce such low levels of oxygen during photosynthesis that they use all of it themselves instead of releasing it to the atmosphere.

Although there are some differences between oxygenic photosynthesis in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, the overall process is quite similar in these organisms. There are also many varieties of anoxygenic photosynthesis, used mostly by bacteria, which consume carbon dioxide but do not release oxygen or which produce elemental sulfur instead of molecular oxygen.

Carbon dioxide is converted into sugars in a process called carbon fixation; photosynthesis captures energy from sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into carbohydrates. Carbon fixation is an endothermic redox reaction. In general outline, photosynthesis is the opposite of cellular respiration: while photosynthesis is a process of reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates, cellular respiration is the oxidation of carbohydrates or other nutrients to carbon dioxide. Nutrients used in cellular respiration include carbohydrates, amino acids and fatty acids. These nutrients are oxidized to produce carbon dioxide and water, and to release chemical energy to drive the organism&#x27;s metabolism.

Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are distinct processes, as they take place through different sequences of chemical reactions and in different cellular compartments (cellular respiration in mitochondria).

The general equation for photosynthesis as first proposed by Cornelis van Niel is:

Since water is used as the electron donor in oxygenic photosynthesis, the equation for this process is:

This equation emphasizes that water is both a reactant in the light-dependent reaction and a product of the light-independent reaction, but canceling &quot;n&quot; water molecules from each side gives the net equation:

Other processes substitute other compounds (such as arsenite) for water in the electron-supply role; for example some microbes use sunlight to oxidize arsenite to arsenate: The equation for this reaction is:
: + + → + (used to build other compounds in subsequent reactions)

Photosynthesis occurs in two stages. In the first stage, &quot;light-dependent reactions&quot; or &quot;light reactions&quot; capture the energy of light and use it to make the hydrogen carrier NADPH and the energy-storage molecule ATP. During the second stage, the &quot;light-independent reactions&quot; use these products to capture and reduce carbon dioxide.

Most organisms that use oxygenic photosynthesis use visible light for the light-dependent reactions, although at least three use shortwave infrared or, more specifically, far-red radiation.

Some organisms employ even more radical variants of photosynthesis. Some archaea use a simpler method that employs a pigment similar to those used for vision in animals. The bacteriorhodopsin changes its configuration in response to sunlight, acting as a proton pump. This produces a proton gradient more directly, which is then converted to chemical energy. The process does not involve carbon dioxide fixation and does not release oxygen, and seems to have evolved separately from the more common types of photosynthesis.

==Photosynthetic membranes and organelles==
In photosynthetic bacteria, the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis are embedded in cell membranes. In its simplest form, this involves the membrane surrounding the cell itself. However, the membrane may be tightly folded into cylindrical sheets called thylakoids, or bunched up into round vesicles called &quot;intracytoplasmic membranes&quot;. These structures can fill most of the interior of a cell, giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb.

In plants and algae, photosynthesis takes place in organelles called chloroplasts. A typical plant cell contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts. The chloroplast is enclosed by a membrane. This membrane is composed of a phospholipid inner membrane, a phospholipid outer membrane, and an intermembrane space. Enclosed by the membrane is an aqueous fluid called the stroma. Embedded within the stroma are stacks of thylakoids (grana), which are the site of photosynthesis. The thylakoids appear as flattened disks. The thylakoid itself is enclosed by the thylakoid membrane, and within the enclosed volume is a lumen or thylakoid space. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are integral and peripheral membrane protein complexes of the photosynthetic system.

Plants absorb light primarily using the pigment chlorophyll. The green part of the light spectrum is not absorbed but is reflected, which is the reason that most plants have a green color. Besides chlorophyll, plants also use pigments such as carotenes and xanthophylls. Algae also use chlorophyll, but various other pigments are present, such as phycocyanin, carotenes, and xanthophylls in green algae, phycoerythrin in red algae (rhodophytes) and fucoxanthin in brown algae and diatoms resulting in a wide variety of colors.

These pigments are embedded in plants and algae in complexes called antenna proteins. In such proteins, the pigments are arranged to work together. Such a combination of proteins is also called a light-harvesting complex.

Although all cells in the green parts of a plant have chloroplasts, the majority of those are found in specially adapted structures called leaves. Certain species adapted to conditions of strong sunlight and aridity, such as many &quot;Euphorbia&quot; and cactus species, have their main photosynthetic organs in their stems. The cells in the interior tissues of a leaf, called the mesophyll, can contain between 450,000 and 800,000 chloroplasts for every square millimeter of leaf. The surface of the leaf is coated with a water-resistant waxy cuticle that protects the leaf from excessive evaporation of water and decreases the absorption of ultraviolet or blue light to minimize heating. The transparent epidermis layer allows light to pass through to the palisade mesophyll cells where most of the photosynthesis takes place.

==Light-dependent reactions==
In the light-dependent reactions, one molecule of the pigment chlorophyll absorbs one photon and loses one electron. This electron is taken up by a modified form of chlorophyll called pheophytin, which passes the electron to a quinone molecule, starting the flow of electrons down an electron transport chain that leads to the ultimate reduction of NADP to NADPH. In addition, this creates a proton gradient (energy gradient) across the chloroplast membrane, which is used by ATP synthase in the synthesis of ATP. The chlorophyll molecule ultimately regains the electron it lost when a water molecule is split in a process called photolysis, which releases oxygen.

The overall equation for the light-dependent reactions under the conditions of non-cyclic electron flow in green plants is:

Not all wavelengths of light can support photosynthesis. The photosynthetic action spectrum depends on the type of accessory pigments present. For example, in green plants, the action spectrum resembles the absorption spectrum for chlorophylls and carotenoids with absorption peaks in violet-blue and red light. In red algae, the action spectrum is blue-green light, which allows these algae to use the blue end of the spectrum to grow in the deeper waters that filter out the longer wavelengths (red light) used by above-ground green plants. The non-absorbed part of the light spectrum is what gives photosynthetic organisms their color (e.g., green plants, red algae, purple bacteria) and is the least effective for photosynthesis in the respective organisms.

===Z scheme===

In plants, light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts where they drive the synthesis of ATP and NADPH. The light-dependent reactions are of two forms: cyclic and non-cyclic.

In the non-cyclic reaction, the photons are captured in the light-harvesting antenna complexes of photosystem II by chlorophyll and other accessory pigments (see diagram &quot;Z-scheme&quot;). The absorption of a photon by the antenna complex loosens an electron by a process called photoinduced charge separation. The antenna system is at the core of the chlorophyll molecule of the photosystem II reaction center. That loosened electron is taken up by the primary electron-acceptor molecule, pheophytin. As the electrons are shuttled through an electron transport chain (the so-called &quot;Z-scheme&quot; shown in the diagram), a chemiosmotic potential is generated by pumping proton cations (H+) across the membrane and into the thylakoid space. An ATP synthase enzyme uses that chemiosmotic potential to make ATP during photophosphorylation, whereas NADPH is a product of the terminal redox reaction in the &quot;Z-scheme&quot;. The electron enters a chlorophyll molecule in Photosystem I. There it is further excited by the light absorbed by that photosystem. The electron is then passed along a chain of electron acceptors to which it transfers some of its energy. The energy delivered to the electron acceptors is used to move hydrogen ions across the thylakoid membrane into the lumen. The electron is eventually used to reduce the coenzyme NADP with an H+ to NADPH (which has functions in the light-independent reaction); at that point, the path of that electron ends.

The cyclic reaction is similar to that of the non-cyclic but differs in that it generates only ATP, and no reduced NADP (NADPH) is created. The cyclic reaction takes place only at photosystem I. Once the electron is displaced from the photosystem, the electron is passed down the electron acceptor molecules and returns to photosystem I, from where it was emitted, hence the name &quot;cyclic reaction&quot;.

===Water photolysis===

Linear electron transport through a photosystem will leave the reaction center of that photosystem oxidized. Elevating another electron will first require re-reduction of the reaction center. The excited electrons lost from the reaction center (P700) of photosystem I are replaced by transfer from plastocyanin, whose electrons come from electron transport through photosystem II. Photosystem II, as the first step of the &quot;Z-scheme&quot;, requires an external source of electrons to reduce its oxidized chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; reaction center. The source of electrons for photosynthesis in green plants and cyanobacteria is water. Two water molecules are oxidized by the energy of four successive charge-separation reactions of photosystem II to yield a molecule of diatomic oxygen and four hydrogen ions. The electrons yielded are transferred to a redox-active tyrosine residue that is oxidized by the energy of P680. This resets the ability of P680 to absorb another photon and release another photo-dissociated electron. The oxidation of water is catalyzed in photosystem II by a redox-active structure that contains four manganese ions and a calcium ion; this oxygen-evolving complex binds two water molecules and contains the four oxidizing equivalents that are used to drive the water-oxidizing reaction (Kok&#x27;s S-state diagrams). The hydrogen ions are released in the thylakoid lumen and therefore contribute to the transmembrane chemiosmotic potential that leads to ATP synthesis. Oxygen is a waste product of light-dependent reactions, but the majority of organisms on Earth use oxygen and its energy for cellular respiration, including photosynthetic organisms.

==Light-independent reactions==

===Calvin cycle===

In the light-independent (or &quot;dark&quot;) reactions, the enzyme RuBisCO captures CO2 from the atmosphere and, in a process called the Calvin cycle, uses the newly formed NADPH and releases three-carbon sugars, which are later combined to form sucrose and starch. The overall equation for the light-independent reactions in green plants is


Carbon fixation produces the three-carbon sugar intermediate, which is then converted into the final carbohydrate products. The simple carbon sugars photosynthesis produces are then used to form other organic compounds, such as the building material cellulose, the precursors for lipid and amino acid biosynthesis, or as a fuel in cellular respiration. The latter occurs not only in plants but also in animals when the carbon and energy from plants is passed through a food chain.

The fixation or reduction of carbon dioxide is a process in which carbon dioxide combines with a five-carbon sugar, ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, to yield two molecules of a three-carbon compound, glycerate 3-phosphate, also known as 3-phosphoglycerate. Glycerate 3-phosphate, in the presence of ATP and NADPH produced during the light-dependent stages, is reduced to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. This product is also referred to as 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde (PGAL) or, more generically, as triose phosphate. Most (five out of six molecules) of the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate produced are used to regenerate ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate so the process can continue. The triose phosphates not thus &quot;recycled&quot; often condense to form hexose phosphates, which ultimately yield sucrose, starch, and cellulose, as well as glucose and fructose. The sugars produced during carbon metabolism yield carbon skeletons that can be used for other metabolic reactions like the production of amino acids and lipids.

===Carbon concentrating mechanisms===

====On land====
In hot and dry conditions, plants close their stomata to prevent water loss. Under these conditions, will decrease and oxygen gas, produced by the light reactions of photosynthesis, will increase, causing an increase of photorespiration by the oxygenase activity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and decrease in carbon fixation. Some plants have evolved mechanisms to increase the concentration in the leaves under these conditions.

Plants that use the C4 carbon fixation process chemically fix carbon dioxide in the cells of the mesophyll by adding it to the three-carbon molecule phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a reaction catalyzed by an enzyme called PEP carboxylase, creating the four-carbon organic acid oxaloacetic acid. Oxaloacetic acid or malate synthesized by this process is then translocated to specialized bundle sheath cells where the enzyme RuBisCO and other Calvin cycle enzymes are located, and where released by decarboxylation of the four-carbon acids is then fixed by RuBisCO activity to the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids. The physical separation of RuBisCO from the oxygen-generating light reactions reduces photorespiration and increases fixation and, thus, the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf. plants can produce more sugar than plants in conditions of high light and temperature. Many important crop plants are plants, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, and millet. Plants that do not use PEP-carboxylase in carbon fixation are called C3 plants because the primary carboxylation reaction, catalyzed by RuBisCO, produces the three-carbon 3-phosphoglyceric acids directly in the Calvin-Benson cycle. Over 90% of plants use carbon fixation, compared to 3% that use carbon fixation; however, the evolution of in over sixty plant lineages makes it a striking example of convergent evolution. C2 photosynthesis, which involves carbon-concentration by selective breakdown of photorespiratory glycine, is both an evolutionary precursor to and a useful carbon-concentrating mechanism in its own right.

Xerophytes, such as cacti and most succulents, also use PEP carboxylase to capture carbon dioxide in a process called Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). In contrast to metabolism, which &quot;spatially&quot; separates the fixation to PEP from the Calvin cycle, CAM &quot;temporally&quot; separates these two processes. CAM plants have a different leaf anatomy from plants, and fix the at night, when their stomata are open. CAM plants store the mostly in the form of malic acid via carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate, which is then reduced to malate. Decarboxylation of malate during the day releases inside the leaves, thus allowing carbon fixation to 3-phosphoglycerate by RuBisCO. CAM is used by 16,000 species of plants.

Calcium-oxalate-accumulating plants, such as &quot;Amaranthus hybridus&quot; and &quot;Colobanthus quitensis,&quot; show a variation of photosynthesis where calcium oxalate crystals function as dynamic carbon pools, supplying carbon dioxide (CO2) to photosynthetic cells when stomata are partially or totally closed. This process was named alarm photosynthesis. Under stress conditions (e.g., water deficit), oxalate released from calcium oxalate crystals is converted to CO2 by an oxalate oxidase enzyme, and the produced CO2 can support the Calvin cycle reactions. Reactive hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the byproduct of oxalate oxidase reaction, can be neutralized by catalase. Alarm photosynthesis represents a photosynthetic variant to be added to the well-known C4 and CAM pathways. However, alarm photosynthesis, in contrast to these pathways, operates as a biochemical pump that collects carbon from the organ interior (or from the soil) and not from the atmosphere.

====In water====
Cyanobacteria possess carboxysomes, which increase the concentration of around RuBisCO to increase the rate of photosynthesis. An enzyme, carbonic anhydrase, located within the carboxysome, releases CO2 from dissolved hydrocarbonate ions (HCO). Before the CO2 can diffuse out, RuBisCO concentrated within the carboxysome quickly sponges it up. HCO ions are made from CO2 outside the cell by another carbonic anhydrase and are actively pumped into the cell by a membrane protein. They cannot cross the membrane as they are charged, and within the cytosol they turn back into CO2 very slowly without the help of carbonic anhydrase. This causes the HCO ions to accumulate within the cell from where they diffuse into the carboxysomes. Pyrenoids in algae and hornworts also act to concentrate around RuBisCO.

==Order and kinetics==
The overall process of photosynthesis takes place in four stages:
==Efficiency==

Plants usually convert light into chemical energy with a photosynthetic efficiency of 3–6%. 
Absorbed light that is unconverted is dissipated primarily as heat, with a small fraction (1–2%) reemitted as chlorophyll fluorescence at longer (redder) wavelengths. This fact allows measurement of the light reaction of photosynthesis by using chlorophyll fluorometers.

Actual plants&#x27; photosynthetic efficiency varies with the frequency of the light being converted, light intensity, temperature, and proportion of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and can vary from 0.1% to 8%. By comparison, solar panels convert light into electric energy at an efficiency of approximately 6–20% for mass-produced panels, and above 40% in laboratory devices.
Scientists are studying photosynthesis in hopes of developing plants with increased yield.

The efficiency of both light and dark reactions can be measured, but the relationship between the two can be complex. For example, the light reaction creates ATP and NADPH energy molecules, which C3 plants can use for carbon fixation or photorespiration. Electrons may also flow to other electron sinks. For this reason, it is not uncommon for authors to differentiate between work done under non-photorespiratory conditions and under photorespiratory conditions.

Chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II can measure the light reaction, and infrared gas analyzers can measure the dark reaction. An integrated chlorophyll fluorometer and gas exchange system can investigate both light and dark reactions when researchers use the two separate systems together. Infrared gas analyzers and some moisture sensors are sensitive enough to measure the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2 and of ΔH2O using reliable methods. CO2 is commonly measured in /(m2/s), parts per million, or volume per million; and H2O is commonly measured in /(m2/s) or in . By measuring CO2 assimilation, ΔH2O, leaf temperature, barometric pressure, leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), it becomes possible to estimate, &quot;A&quot; or carbon assimilation, &quot;E&quot; or transpiration, &quot;gs&quot; or stomatal conductance, and &quot;Ci&quot; or intracellular CO2. However, it is more common to use chlorophyll fluorescence for plant stress measurement, where appropriate, because the most commonly used parameters FV/FM and Y(II) or F/FM&#x27; can be measured in a few seconds, allowing the investigation of larger plant populations.

Gas exchange systems that offer control of CO2 levels, above and below ambient, allow the common practice of measurement of A/Ci curves, at different CO2 levels, to characterize a plant&#x27;s photosynthetic response.

Integrated chlorophyll fluorometer – gas exchange systems allow a more precise measure of photosynthetic response and mechanisms. While standard gas exchange photosynthesis systems can measure Ci, or substomatal CO2 levels, the addition of integrated chlorophyll fluorescence measurements allows a more precise measurement of CC, the estimation of CO2 concentration at the site of carboxylation in the chloroplast, to replace Ci. CO2 concentration in the chloroplast becomes possible to estimate with the measurement of mesophyll conductance or gm using an integrated system.

Photosynthesis measurement systems are not designed to directly measure the amount of light the leaf absorbs, but analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence, P700- and P515-absorbance, and gas exchange measurements reveal detailed information about, e.g., the photosystems, quantum efficiency and the CO2 assimilation rates. With some instruments, even wavelength dependency of the photosynthetic efficiency can be analyzed.

A phenomenon known as quantum walk increases the efficiency of the energy transport of light significantly. In the photosynthetic cell of an alga, bacterium, or plant, there are light-sensitive molecules called chromophores arranged in an antenna-shaped structure called a photocomplex. When a photon is absorbed by a chromophore, it is converted into a quasiparticle referred to as an exciton, which jumps from chromophore to chromophore towards the reaction center of the photocomplex, a collection of molecules that traps its energy in a chemical form accessible to the cell&#x27;s metabolism. The exciton&#x27;s wave properties enable it to cover a wider area and try out several possible paths simultaneously, allowing it to instantaneously &quot;choose&quot; the most efficient route, where it will have the highest probability of arriving at its destination in the minimum possible time.

Because that quantum walking takes place at temperatures far higher than quantum phenomena usually occur, it is only possible over very short distances. Obstacles in the form of destructive interference cause the particle to lose its wave properties for an instant before it regains them once again after it is freed from its locked position through a classic &quot;hop&quot;. The movement of the electron towards the photo center is therefore covered in a series of conventional hops and quantum walks.

==Evolution==
Fossils of what are thought to be filamentous photosynthetic organisms have been dated at 3.4 billion years old. More recent studies also suggest that photosynthesis may have begun about 3.4 billion years ago, though the first direct evidence of photosynthesis comes from thylakoid membranes preserved in 1.75-billion-year-old cherts.

Oxygenic photosynthesis is the main source of oxygen in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and its earliest appearance is sometimes referred to as the oxygen catastrophe. Geological evidence suggests that oxygenic photosynthesis, such as that in cyanobacteria, became important during the Paleoproterozoic era around two billion years ago. Modern photosynthesis in plants and most photosynthetic prokaryotes is oxygenic, using water as an electron donor, which is oxidized to molecular oxygen in the photosynthetic reaction center.

===Symbiosis and the origin of chloroplasts===
Several groups of animals have formed symbiotic relationships with photosynthetic algae. These are most common in corals, sponges, and sea anemones. Scientists presume that this is due to the particularly simple body plans and large surface areas of these animals compared to their volumes. In addition, a few marine mollusks, such as &quot;Elysia viridis&quot; and &quot;Elysia chlorotica,&quot; also maintain a symbiotic relationship with chloroplasts they capture from the algae in their diet and then store in their bodies (see Kleptoplasty). This allows the mollusks to survive solely by photosynthesis for several months at a time. Some of the genes from the plant cell nucleus have even been transferred to the slugs, so that the chloroplasts can be supplied with proteins they need to survive.

An even closer form of symbiosis may explain the origin of chloroplasts. Chloroplasts have many similarities with photosynthetic bacteria, including a circular chromosome, prokaryotic-type ribosome, and similar proteins in the photosynthetic reaction center. The endosymbiotic theory suggests that photosynthetic bacteria were acquired (by endocytosis) by early eukaryotic cells to form the first plant cells. Therefore, chloroplasts may be photosynthetic bacteria that adapted to life inside plant cells. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts possess their own DNA, separate from the nuclear DNA of their plant host cells and the genes in this chloroplast DNA resemble those found in cyanobacteria. DNA in chloroplasts codes for redox proteins such as those found in the photosynthetic reaction centers. The CoRR Hypothesis proposes that this co-location of genes with their gene products is required for redox regulation of gene expression, and accounts for the persistence of DNA in bioenergetic organelles.

===Photosynthetic eukaryotic lineages===
Symbiotic and kleptoplastic organisms excluded:

*The glaucophytes and the red and green algae—clade Archaeplastida (uni- and multicellular)
*The cryptophytes—clade Cryptista (unicellular)
*The haptophytes—clade Haptista (unicellular)
*The dinoflagellates and chromerids in the superphylum Myzozoa, and Pseudoblepharisma in the phylum Ciliophora—clade Alveolata (unicellular)
*The ochrophytes—clade Stramenopila (uni- and multicellular)
*The chlorarachniophytes and three species of Paulinella in the phylum Cercozoa—clade Rhizaria (unicellular)
*The euglenids—clade Excavata (unicellular)

Except for the euglenids, which are found within the Excavata, all of these belong to the Diaphoretickes. Archaeplastida and the photosynthetic Paulinella got their plastids, which are surrounded by two membranes, through primary endosymbiosis in two separate events, by engulfing a cyanobacterium. The plastids in all the other groups have either a red or green algal origin, and are referred to as the &quot;red lineages&quot; and the &quot;green lineages&quot;. The only known exception is the ciliate Pseudoblepharisma tenue, which in addition to its plastids that originated from green algae also has a purple sulfur bacterium as symbiont. In dinoflagellates and euglenids the plastids are surrounded by three membranes, and in the remaining lines by four. A nucleomorph, remnants of the original algal nucleus located between the inner and outer membranes of the plastid, is present in the cryptophytes (from a red alga) and chlorarachniophytes (from a green alga).
Some dinoflagellates that lost their photosynthetic ability later regained it again through new endosymbiotic events with different algae.
While able to perform photosynthesis, many of these eukaryotic groups are mixotrophs and practice heterotrophy to various degrees.

===Photosynthetic prokaryotic lineages===
Early photosynthetic systems, such as those in green and purple sulfur and green and purple nonsulfur bacteria, are thought to have been anoxygenic, and used various other molecules than water as electron donors. Green and purple sulfur bacteria are thought to have used hydrogen and sulfur as electron donors. Green nonsulfur bacteria used various amino and other organic acids as electron donors. Purple nonsulfur bacteria used a variety of nonspecific organic molecules. The use of these molecules is consistent with the geological evidence that Earth&#x27;s early atmosphere was highly reducing at that time.

With a possible exception of Heimdallarchaeota, photosynthesis is not found in archaea. Haloarchaea are photoheterotrophic; they can absorb energy from the sun, but do not harvest carbon from the atmosphere and are therefore not photosynthetic. Instead of chlorophyll they use rhodopsins, which convert light-energy to ion gradients but cannot mediate electron transfer reactions.

In bacteria eight photosynthetic lineages are currently known:

*Cyanobacteria, the only prokaryotes performing oxygenic photosynthesis and the only prokaryotes that contain two types of photosystems (type I (RCI), also known as Fe-S type, and type II (RCII), also known as quinone type). The seven remaining prokaryotes have anoxygenic photosynthesis and use versions of either type I or type II.
*Chlorobi (green sulfur bacteria) Type I
*Heliobacteria Type I
*Chloracidobacterium Type I
*Proteobacteria (purple sulfur bacteria and purple non-sulfur bacteria) Type II (see: Purple bacteria)
*Chloroflexota (green non-sulfur bacteria) Type II
*Gemmatimonadota Type II
*Eremiobacterota Type II

===Cyanobacteria and the evolution of photosynthesis===
The biochemical capacity to use water as the source for electrons in photosynthesis evolved once, in a common ancestor of extant cyanobacteria (formerly called blue-green algae). The geological record indicates that this transforming event took place early in Earth&#x27;s history, at least 2450–2320 million years ago (Ma), and, it is speculated, much earlier. Because the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere contained almost no oxygen during the estimated development of photosynthesis, it is believed that the first photosynthetic cyanobacteria did not generate oxygen. Available evidence from geobiological studies of Archean (&gt;2500 Ma) sedimentary rocks indicates that life existed 3500 Ma, but the question of when oxygenic photosynthesis evolved is still unanswered. A clear paleontological window on cyanobacterial evolution opened about 2000 Ma, revealing an already-diverse biota of cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria remained the principal primary producers of oxygen throughout the Proterozoic Eon (2500–543 Ma), in part because the redox structure of the oceans favored photoautotrophs capable of nitrogen fixation. Green algae joined cyanobacteria as the major primary producers of oxygen on continental shelves near the end of the Proterozoic, but only with the Mesozoic (251–66 Ma) radiations of dinoflagellates, coccolithophorids, and diatoms did the primary production of oxygen in marine shelf waters take modern form. Cyanobacteria remain critical to marine ecosystems as primary producers of oxygen in oceanic gyres, as agents of biological nitrogen fixation, and, in modified form, as the plastids of marine algae.

==Experimental history==
===Discovery===
Although some of the steps in photosynthesis are still not completely understood, the overall photosynthetic equation has been known since the 19th century.

Jan van Helmont began the research of the process in the mid-17th century when he carefully measured the mass of the soil a plant was using and the mass of the plant as it grew. After noticing that the soil mass changed very little, he hypothesized that the mass of the growing plant must come from the water, the only substance he added to the potted plant. His hypothesis was partially accurate – much of the gained mass comes from carbon dioxide as well as water. However, this was a signaling point to the idea that the bulk of a plant&#x27;s biomass comes from the inputs of photosynthesis, not the soil itself.

Joseph Priestley, a chemist and minister, discovered that when he isolated a volume of air under an inverted jar and burned a candle in it (which gave off CO2), the candle would burn out very quickly, much before it ran out of wax. He further discovered that a mouse could similarly &quot;injure&quot; air. He then showed that a plant could restore the air the candle and the mouse had &quot;injured.&quot;

In 1779, Jan Ingenhousz repeated Priestley&#x27;s experiments. He discovered that it was the influence of sunlight on the plant that could cause it to revive a mouse in a matter of hours.

In 1796, Jean Senebier, a Swiss pastor, botanist, and naturalist, demonstrated that green plants consume carbon dioxide and release oxygen under the influence of light. Soon afterward, Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure showed that the increase in mass of the plant as it grows could not be due only to uptake of CO2 but also to the incorporation of water. Thus, the basic reaction by which organisms use photosynthesis to produce food (such as glucose) was outlined.

===Refinements===
Cornelis Van Niel made key discoveries explaining the chemistry of photosynthesis. By studying purple sulfur bacteria and green bacteria, he was the first to demonstrate that photosynthesis is a light-dependent redox reaction in which hydrogen reduces (donates its atoms as electrons and protons to) carbon dioxide.

Robert Emerson discovered two light reactions by testing plant productivity using different wavelengths of light. With the red alone, the light reactions were suppressed. When blue and red were combined, the output was much more substantial. Thus, there were two photosystems, one absorbing up to 600 nm wavelengths, the other up to 700 nm. The former is known as PSII, the latter is PSI. PSI contains only chlorophyll &quot;a&quot;, PSII contains primarily chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; with most of the available chlorophyll &quot;b&quot;, among other pigments. These include phycobilins, which are the red and blue pigments of red and blue algae, respectively, and fucoxanthol for brown algae and diatoms. The process is most productive when the absorption of quanta is equal in both PSII and PSI, assuring that input energy from the antenna complex is divided between the PSI and PSII systems, which in turn powers the photochemistry.

Robert Hill thought that a complex of reactions consisted of an intermediate to cytochrome b6 (now a plastoquinone), and that another was from cytochrome f to a step in the carbohydrate-generating mechanisms. These are linked by plastoquinone, which does require energy to reduce cytochrome f. Further experiments to prove that the oxygen developed during the photosynthesis of green plants came from water were performed by Hill in 1937 and 1939. He showed that isolated chloroplasts give off oxygen in the presence of unnatural reducing agents like iron oxalate, ferricyanide or benzoquinone after exposure to light. In the Hill reaction:

:2 H2O + 2 A + (light, chloroplasts) → 2 AH2 + O2

A is the electron acceptor. Therefore, in light, the electron acceptor is reduced and oxygen is evolved. Samuel Ruben and Martin Kamen used radioactive isotopes to determine that the oxygen liberated in photosynthesis came from the water.

Melvin Calvin and Andrew Benson, along with James Bassham, elucidated the path of carbon assimilation (the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle) in plants. The carbon reduction cycle is known as the Calvin cycle, but many scientists refer to it as the Calvin-Benson, Benson-Calvin, or even Calvin-Benson-Bassham (or CBB) Cycle.

Nobel Prize–winning scientist Rudolph A. Marcus was later able to discover the function and significance of the electron transport chain.

Otto Heinrich Warburg and Dean Burk discovered the I-quantum photosynthesis reaction that splits CO2, activated by the respiration.

In 1950, first experimental evidence for the existence of photophosphorylation &quot;in vivo&quot; was presented by Otto Kandler using intact &quot;Chlorella&quot; cells and interpreting his findings as light-dependent ATP formation.
In 1954, Daniel I. Arnon et al. discovered photophosphorylation &quot;in vitro&quot; in isolated chloroplasts with the help of P32.

Louis N. M. Duysens and Jan Amesz discovered that chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; will absorb one light, oxidize cytochrome f, while chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; (and other pigments) will absorb another light but will reduce this same oxidized cytochrome, stating the two light reactions are in series.

===Development of the concept===
In 1893, the American botanist Charles Reid Barnes proposed two terms, &quot;photosyntax&quot; and &quot;photosynthesis&quot;, for the biological process of &quot;synthesis of complex carbon compounds out of carbonic acid, in the presence of chlorophyll, under the influence of light&quot;. The term &quot;photosynthesis&quot; is derived from the Greek &quot;phōs&quot; (, gleam) and &quot;sýnthesis&quot; (, arranging together), while another word that he designated was &quot;photosyntax&quot;, from &quot;sýntaxis&quot; (, configuration). Over time, the term &quot;photosynthesis&quot; came into common usage. Later discovery of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria and photophosphorylation necessitated redefinition of the term.

===C3 : C4 photosynthesis research===
In the late 1940s at the University of California, Berkeley, the details of photosynthetic carbon metabolism were sorted out by the chemists Melvin Calvin, Andrew Benson, James Bassham and a score of students and researchers utilizing the carbon-14 isotope and paper chromatography techniques. The pathway of CO2 fixation by the algae &quot;Chlorella&quot; in a fraction of a second in light resulted in a three carbon molecule called phosphoglyceric acid (PGA). For that original and ground-breaking work, a Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Melvin Calvin in 1961. In parallel, plant physiologists studied leaf gas exchanges using the new method of infrared gas analysis and a leaf chamber where the net photosynthetic rates ranged from 10 to 13 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1, with the conclusion that all terrestrial plants have the same photosynthetic capacities, that are light saturated at less than 50% of sunlight.

Later in 1958–1963 at Cornell University, field grown maize was reported to have much greater leaf photosynthetic rates of 40 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1 and not be saturated at near full sunlight. This higher rate in maize was almost double of those observed in other species such as wheat and soybean, indicating that large differences in photosynthesis exist among higher plants. At the University of Arizona, detailed gas exchange research on more than 15 species of monocots and dicots uncovered for the first time that differences in leaf anatomy are crucial factors in differentiating photosynthetic capacities among species. In tropical grasses, including maize, sorghum, sugarcane, Bermuda grass and in the dicot amaranthus, leaf photosynthetic rates were around 38−40 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1, and the leaves have two types of green cells, i.e. outer layer of mesophyll cells surrounding a tightly packed cholorophyllous vascular bundle sheath cells. This type of anatomy was termed Kranz anatomy in the 19th century by the botanist Gottlieb Haberlandt while studying leaf anatomy of sugarcane. Plant species with the greatest photosynthetic rates and Kranz anatomy showed no apparent photorespiration, very low CO2 compensation point, high optimum temperature, high stomatal resistances and lower mesophyll resistances for gas diffusion and rates never saturated at full sun light. The research at Arizona was designated a Citation Classic in 1986. These species were later termed C4 plants as the first stable compound of CO2 fixation in light has four carbons as malate and aspartate. Other species that lack Kranz anatomy were termed C3 type such as cotton and sunflower, as the first stable carbon compound is the three-carbon PGA. At 1000 ppm CO2 in measuring air, both the C3 and C4 plants had similar leaf photosynthetic rates around 60 μmol CO2·m−2·s−1 indicating the suppression of photorespiration in C3 plants.

==Factors==
There are four main factors influencing photosynthesis and several corollary factors. The four main are:
* Light irradiance and wavelength
* Water absorption
* Carbon dioxide concentration
* Temperature.

Total photosynthesis is limited by a range of environmental factors. These include the amount of light available, the amount of leaf area a plant has to capture light (shading by other plants is a major limitation of photosynthesis), the rate at which carbon dioxide can be supplied to the chloroplasts to support photosynthesis, the availability of water, and the availability of suitable temperatures for carrying out photosynthesis.

===Light intensity (irradiance), wavelength and temperature===
The process of photosynthesis provides the main input of free energy into the biosphere, and is one of four main ways in which radiation is important for plant life.

The radiation climate within plant communities is extremely variable, in both time and space.

In the early 20th century, Frederick Blackman and Gabrielle Matthaei investigated the effects of light intensity (irradiance) and temperature on the rate of carbon assimilation.
* At constant temperature, the rate of carbon assimilation varies with irradiance, increasing as the irradiance increases, but reaching a plateau at higher irradiance.
* At low irradiance, increasing the temperature has little influence on the rate of carbon assimilation. At constant high irradiance, the rate of carbon assimilation increases as the temperature is increased.
These two experiments illustrate several important points: First, it is known that, in general, photochemical reactions are not affected by temperature. However, these experiments clearly show that temperature affects the rate of carbon assimilation, so there must be two sets of reactions in the full process of carbon assimilation. These are the light-dependent &#x27;photochemical&#x27; temperature-independent stage, and the light-independent, temperature-dependent stage. Second, Blackman&#x27;s experiments illustrate the concept of limiting factors. Another limiting factor is the wavelength of light. Cyanobacteria, which reside several meters underwater, cannot receive the correct wavelengths required to cause photoinduced charge separation in conventional photosynthetic pigments. To combat this problem, Cyanobacteria have a light-harvesting complex called Phycobilisome. This complex is made up of a series of proteins with different pigments which surround the reaction center.

===Carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration===

As carbon dioxide concentrations rise, the rate at which sugars are made by the light-independent reactions increases until limited by other factors. RuBisCO, the enzyme that captures carbon dioxide in the light-independent reactions, has a binding affinity for both carbon dioxide and oxygen. When the concentration of carbon dioxide is high, RuBisCO will fix carbon dioxide. However, if the carbon dioxide concentration is low, RuBisCO will bind oxygen instead of carbon dioxide. This process, called photorespiration, uses energy, but does not produce sugars.

RuBisCO oxygenase activity is disadvantageous to plants for several reasons:
# One product of oxygenase activity is phosphoglycolate (2 carbon) instead of 3-phosphoglycerate (3 carbon). Phosphoglycolate cannot be metabolized by the Calvin-Benson cycle and represents carbon lost from the cycle. A high oxygenase activity, therefore, drains the sugars that are required to recycle ribulose 5-bisphosphate and for the continuation of the Calvin-Benson cycle.
# Phosphoglycolate is quickly metabolized to glycolate that is toxic to a plant at a high concentration; it inhibits photosynthesis.
# Salvaging glycolate is an energetically expensive process that uses the glycolate pathway, and only 75% of the carbon is returned to the Calvin-Benson cycle as 3-phosphoglycerate. The reactions also produce ammonia (NH3), which is able to diffuse out of the plant, leading to a loss of nitrogen.

::A highly simplified summary is:

:::2 glycolate + ATP → 3-phosphoglycerate + carbon dioxide + ADP + NH3

The salvaging pathway for the products of RuBisCO oxygenase activity is more commonly known as photorespiration, since it is characterized by light-dependent oxygen consumption and the release of carbon dioxide.

<text>The Pasporta Servo () is a hospitality exchange service available both online and in print that lists people in Esperanto culture who are willing to offer free homestays to speakers of Esperanto. It is maintained by the World Esperanto Youth Organization (TEJO). The platform is a gift economy; hosts are not allowed to charge for lodging. Guests using the service are encouraged to speak only Esperanto with their hosts.

==History==
In 1966, psychologist Rubén Feldman González started the &quot;Programo Pasporto&quot;, a lodging service for Esperanto speakers, in Argentina.

In 1974, the Pasporta Servo directory was first published, listing 40 hosts.

In August 2008, the directory was first published online.

=== Censorship ===
, the online website has been blocked by the Iranian government.

<text>Pierre-Auguste Renoir (; ; 25 February 1841 – 3 December 1919) was a French artist who was a leading painter in the development of the Impressionist style. As a celebrator of beauty and especially feminine sensuality, it has been said that &quot;Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau.&quot;

He was the father of actor Pierre Renoir (1885–1952), filmmaker Jean Renoir (1894–1979) and ceramic artist Claude Renoir (1901–1969). He was the grandfather of the filmmaker Claude Renoir (1913–1993), son of Pierre.

==Life==
===Youth===

Pierre-Auguste Renoir was born in Limoges, Haute-Vienne, France, in 1841. His father, Léonard Renoir, was a tailor of modest means, so, in 1844, Renoir&#x27;s family moved to Paris in search of more favorable prospects. The location of their home, in rue d&#x27;Argenteuil in central Paris, placed Renoir in proximity to the Louvre. Although the young Renoir had a natural proclivity for drawing, he exhibited a greater talent for singing. His talent was encouraged by his teacher, Charles Gounod, who was the choirmaster at the Church of St Roch at the time. However, due to the family&#x27;s financial circumstances, Renoir had to discontinue his music lessons and leave school at the age of thirteen to pursue an apprenticeship at a porcelain factory.

Although Renoir displayed a talent for his work, he frequently tired of the subject matter and sought refuge in the galleries of the Louvre. The owner of the factory recognized his apprentice&#x27;s talent and communicated this to Renoir&#x27;s family. Following this, Renoir started taking lessons to prepare for entry into Ecole des Beaux Arts. When the porcelain factory adopted mechanical reproduction processes in 1858, Renoir was forced to find other means to support his learning. Before he enrolled in art school, he also painted hangings for overseas missionaries and decorations on fans.

In 1862, he began studying art under Charles Gleyre in Paris. There he met Alfred Sisley, Frédéric Bazille, and Claude Monet. At times, during the 1860s, he did not have enough money to buy paint. Renoir had his first success at the Salon of 1868 with his painting &quot;Lise with a Parasol&quot; (1867), which depicted Lise Tréhot, his lover at the time. Although Renoir first started exhibiting paintings at the Paris Salon in 1864, recognition was slow in coming, partly as a result of the turmoil of the Franco-Prussian War.

During the Paris Commune in 1871, while Renoir painted on the banks of the Seine River, some Communards thought he was a spy and were about to throw him into the river, when a leader of the &quot;Commune&quot;, Raoul Rigault, recognized Renoir as the man who had protected him on an earlier occasion. In 1874, a ten-year friendship with Jules Le Cœur and his family ended, and Renoir lost not only the valuable support gained by the association but also a generous welcome to stay on their property near Fontainebleau and its scenic forest. This loss of a favorite painting location resulted in a distinct change of subjects.

===Adulthood===
Renoir was inspired by the style and subject matter of previous modern painters Camille Pissarro and Édouard Manet. After a series of rejections by the Salon juries, he joined forces with Monet, Sisley, Pissarro, and several other artists to mount the First Impressionist Exhibition in April 1874, in which Renoir displayed six paintings. Although the critical response to the exhibition was largely unfavorable, Renoir&#x27;s work was comparatively well received. That same year, two of his works were shown with Durand-Ruel in London.
Hoping to secure a livelihood by attracting portrait commissions, Renoir displayed mostly portraits at the second Impressionist exhibition in 1876. He contributed a more diverse range of paintings the next year when the group presented its third exhibition; they included &quot;Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette&quot; and &quot;The Swing&quot;. Renoir did not exhibit in the fourth or fifth Impressionist exhibitions, and instead resumed submitting his works to the Salon. By the end of the 1870s, particularly after the success of his painting &quot;Mme Charpentier and her Children&quot; (1878) at the Salon of 1879, Renoir was a successful and fashionable painter.

It was also in 1879 that he met the man who was soon to become his main patron, Paul Bérard, who regularly invited him to paint and enjoy the Normandy seaside at the Château de Wargemont.

In 1881, he traveled to Algeria, a country he associated with Eugène Delacroix, then to Madrid, to see the work of Diego Velázquez. Following that, he traveled to Italy to see Titian&#x27;s masterpieces in Florence and the paintings of Raphael in Rome. On 15 January 1882, Renoir met the composer Richard Wagner at his home in Palermo, Sicily. Renoir painted Wagner&#x27;s portrait in just thirty-five minutes. In the same year, after contracting pneumonia which permanently damaged his respiratory system, Renoir convalesced for six weeks in Algeria.

In 1883, Renoir spent the summer in Guernsey, one of the islands in the English Channel with a varied landscape of beaches, cliffs, and bays, where he created fifteen paintings in little over a month. Most of these feature &quot;Moulin Huet&quot;, a bay in Saint Martin&#x27;s, Guernsey. These paintings were the subject of a set of commemorative postage stamps issued by the Bailiwick of Guernsey in 1983.

While living and working in Montmartre, Renoir employed Suzanne Valadon as a model, who posed for him (&quot;The Large Bathers&quot;, 1884–1887; &quot;Dance at Bougival&quot;, 1883) and many of his fellow painters; during that time, she studied their techniques and eventually became one of the leading painters of the day.

In 1887, the year when Queen Victoria celebrated her Golden Jubilee, and upon the request of the queen&#x27;s associate, Phillip Richbourg, Renoir donated several paintings to the &quot;French Impressionist Paintings&quot; catalog as a token of his loyalty.
In 1890, he married Aline Victorine Charigot, a dressmaker twenty years his junior, who, along with a number of the artist&#x27;s friends, had already served as a model for &quot;Le Déjeuner des canotiers&quot; (&quot;Luncheon of the Boating Party&quot;; she is the woman on the left playing with the dog) in 1881, and with whom he had already had a child, Pierre, in 1885. After marrying, Renoir painted many scenes of his wife and daily family life including their children and their nurse, Aline&#x27;s cousin Gabrielle Renard. The Renoirs had three sons: Pierre Renoir (1885–1952), who became a stage and film actor; Jean Renoir (1894–1979), who became a filmmaker of note; and Claude Renoir (1901–1969), who became a ceramic artist.

===Later years===

Around 1892, Renoir developed rheumatoid arthritis. In 1907, he moved to the warmer climate of &quot;Les Collettes&quot;, a farm at the village of Cagnes-sur-Mer, Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur, close to the Mediterranean coast. Renoir painted during the last twenty years of his life even after his arthritis severely limited his mobility. He developed progressive deformities in his hands and ankylosis of his right shoulder, requiring him to change his painting technique. It has often been reported that in the advanced stages of his arthritis, he painted by having a brush strapped to his paralyzed fingers, but this is erroneous; Renoir remained able to grasp a brush, although he required an assistant to place it in his hand. The wrapping of his hands with bandages, apparent in late photographs of the artist, served to prevent skin irritation.

In 1919, Renoir visited the Louvre to see his paintings hanging with those of the old masters. During this period, he created sculptures by cooperating with a young artist, Richard Guino, who worked the clay. Due to his limited joint mobility, Renoir also used a moving canvas, or picture roll, to facilitate painting large works.

Renoir&#x27;s portrait of Austrian actress Tilla Durieux (1914) contains playful flecks of vibrant color on her shawl that offset the classical pose of the actress and highlight Renoir&#x27;s skill just five years before his death.

Renoir died in Cagnes-sur-Mer on 3 December 1919 at the age of 78.

=== Family legacy ===
Pierre-Auguste Renoir&#x27;s great-grandson, Alexandre Renoir, has also become a professional artist. In 2018, the Monthaven Arts and Cultural Center in Hendersonville, Tennessee, hosted &quot;Beauty Remains&quot;, an exhibition of his works. The exhibition title comes from a famous quote by Pierre-Auguste who, when asked why he continued to paint with his painful arthritis in his advanced years, once said &quot;The pain passes, but the beauty remains.&quot;

==Artworks==

Renoir&#x27;s paintings are notable for their vibrant light and saturated color, most often focusing on people in intimate and candid compositions. The female nude was one of his primary subjects. However, in 1876, a reviewer in Le Figaro wrote &quot;Try to explain to Monsieur Renoir that a woman&#x27;s torso is not a mass of decomposing flesh with those purplish green stains that denote a state of complete putrefaction in a corpse.&quot; Yet in characteristic Impressionist style, Renoir suggested the details of a scene through freely brushed touches of colour, so that his figures softly fuse with one another and their surroundings.

His initial paintings show the influence of the colorism of Eugène Delacroix and the luminosity of Camille Corot. He also admired the realism of Gustave Courbet and Édouard Manet, and his early work resembles theirs in his use of black as a color. Renoir admired Edgar Degas&#x27; sense of movement. Other painters Renoir greatly admired were the 18th-century masters François Boucher and Jean-Honoré Fragonard.

A fine example of Renoir&#x27;s early work and evidence of the influence of Courbet&#x27;s realism, is &quot;Diana&quot;, 1867. Ostensibly a mythological subject, the painting is a naturalistic studio work; the figure carefully observed, solidly modeled and superimposed upon a contrived landscape. If the work is a &quot;student&quot; piece, Renoir&#x27;s heightened personal response to female sensuality is present. The model was Lise Tréhot, the artist&#x27;s mistress at that time, and inspiration for a number of paintings.

In the late 1860s, through the practice of painting light and water &quot;en plein air&quot; (outdoors), he and his friend Claude Monet discovered that the color of shadows is not brown or black, but the reflected color of the objects surrounding them, an effect known today as diffuse reflection. Several pairs of paintings exist in which Renoir and Monet worked side-by-side, depicting the same scenes (&quot;La Grenouillère&quot;, 1869).

One of the best-known Impressionist works is Renoir&#x27;s 1876 &quot;Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette (Bal du moulin de la Galette)&quot;. The painting depicts an open-air scene, crowded with people at a popular dance garden on the &quot;Butte Montmartre&quot; close to where he lived. The works of his early maturity were typically Impressionist snapshots of real life, full of sparkling color and light.
By the mid-1880s, however, he had broken with the movement to apply a more disciplined formal technique to portraits and figure paintings, particularly of women. It was a trip to Italy in 1881 when he saw works by Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci, Titian, and other Renaissance masters, that convinced him that he was on the wrong path. At that point he declared, &quot;I had gone as far as I could with Impressionism and I realized I could neither paint nor draw&quot;.

For the next several years he painted in a more severe style in an attempt to return to classicism. Concentrating on his drawing and emphasizing the outlines of figures, he painted works such as &quot;Blonde Bather&quot; (1881 and 1882) and &quot;The Large Bathers&quot; (1884–1887; Philadelphia Museum of Art) during what is sometimes referred to as his &quot;Ingres period&quot;.
After 1890 he changed direction again. To dissolve outlines, as in his earlier work, he returned to thinly brushed color.

From this period onward he concentrated on monumental nudes and domestic scenes, fine examples of which are &quot;Girls at the Piano&quot;, 1892, and &quot;Grandes Baigneuses&quot;, 1887. The latter painting is the most typical and successful of Renoir&#x27;s late, abundantly fleshed nudes.

A prolific artist, he created several thousand paintings. The warm sensuality of Renoir&#x27;s style made his paintings some of the most well-known and frequently reproduced works in the history of art. The single largest collection of his works—181 paintings in all—is at the Barnes Foundation, in Philadelphia.

===Catalogue raisonné===
A five-volume &quot;catalogue raisonné&quot; of Renoir&#x27;s works (with one supplement) was published by Bernheim-Jeune between 1983 and 2014. Bernheim-Jeune is the only surviving major art dealer that was used by Renoir. The Wildenstein Institute is preparing, but has not yet published, a critical catalogue of Renoir&#x27;s work. A disagreement between these two organizations concerning an unsigned work in Picton Castle was at the centre of the second episode of the fourth season of the television series &quot;Fake or Fortune&quot;.

===Posthumous prints===
In 1919, Ambroise Vollard, a renowned art dealer, published a book on the life and work of Renoir, &quot;La Vie et l&#x27;Œuvre de Pierre-Auguste Renoir&quot;, in an edition of 1000 copies. In 1986, Vollard&#x27;s heirs started reprinting the copper plates, generally, etchings with hand applied watercolor. These prints are signed by Renoir in the plate and are embossed &quot;Vollard&quot; in the lower margin. They are not numbered, dated or signed in pencil.

===Posthumous sales===
A small version of &quot;Bal du moulin de la Galette&quot; sold for $78.1 million 17 May 1990 at Sotheby&#x27;s New York.

In 2012, Renoir&#x27;s &quot;Paysage Bords de Seine&quot; was offered for sale at auction but the painting was discovered to have been stolen from the Baltimore Museum of Art in 1951. The sale was cancelled.

<text>A poll tax, also known as head tax or capitation, is a tax levied as a fixed sum on every liable individual (typically every adult), without reference to income or resources. &quot;Poll&quot; is an archaic term for &quot;head&quot; or &quot;top of the head&quot;. The sense of &quot;counting heads&quot; is found in phrases like polling place and opinion poll.

Head taxes were important sources of revenue for many governments from ancient times until the 19th century. In the United Kingdom, poll taxes were levied by the governments of John of Gaunt in the 14th century, Charles II in the 17th and Margaret Thatcher in the 20th century. In the United States, voting poll taxes (whose payment was a precondition to voting in an election) have been used to disenfranchise impoverished and minority voters (especially after Reconstruction).

Poll taxes are regressive, meaning the higher someone&#x27;s income is, the lower the tax is as a proportion of income: for example, a $100 tax on an income of $10,000 is a 1% tax rate, while $100 tax on a $500 income is 20%. Its acceptance or &quot;neutrality&quot; depends on the balance between the tax demanded and the resources of the population. Low amounts generally go unnoticed, while high amounts may generate tax revolts such as the 1381 Peasants&#x27; Revolt in England and the 1906 Bambatha Rebellion against colonial rule in South Africa. However, both of those cases were additional taxation, and not a substitute for other taxes being lowered.

==Religious law==

===Mosaic law===
As prescribed in Exodus, Jewish law imposed a poll tax of a half-shekel, payable by every man above the age of twenty.

The money was designated for the Tabernacle in the Exodus narrative and later for the upkeep of the Temple of Jerusalem. Priests, women, slaves and minors were exempted, but could offer it voluntarily. Payment by Samaritans or Gentiles was rejected. It was collected yearly in the month of Adar at the Temple or provincial collection offices.

===Islamic law===
 is an obligatory charity that must be given by every Muslim (or their guardian) near the end of every Ramadan, except for those in dire poverty. The amount is of wheat or barley, or its cash equivalent, to be given to the poor.

 is a land or poll tax decreed by the Quran, paid annually by non-believers in Islam living under Islamic law (residents with status). began during the reign of Muhammad (from 9 A.H.) in places like Yemen, Bahrain, and Jerash. As a poll tax, the tax usually only applied to free, abled-bodied adult men. The amount could also vary with the income of the individual. However, according to Shibli Nomani, the word is an Arabicised version of the Persian , the war tax levied by the Persian empire, which served as a model for the conquering Arabs. The Sasanian Persian emperor Nawsherwan imposed a poll tax, termed by Arab historians, varying between 12 and 2 dirhams, exempting officials, soldiers, and nobles. During the Islamic rule of Muhammad, the magi of Iran and landowners of Bahrain paid of 1 dinar or its equivalent in clothing, while the landless paid 4 dirham and a striped woolen cloak. Elsewhere, the was graded according to three classes, e.g. 48 dirhams for the rich, 24 for the middle class, and 12 for the poor.

Although the tax is interpreted by many as a financial humiliation on non-Muslims, others consider it a sign of due allegiance to the political authority of Islam: part of a social contract by which non-Muslims, especially the Jews of Medina, were granted equal social and political rights, and protection of their life, property, and religion. According to some scholars, the paid by non-Muslims is parallel to the charity obligation on Muslims. However, Umar, the second Caliph, ordered a brand on the shoulder of payers, as well as requiring a tonsure and sumptuary laws to distinguish them from Muslims. Uman distinguished between and , where the former means the poll tax on non-Muslim individuals, and the latter means the land tax and sometimes the total sum of taxes paid by leaders of the non-Muslim community. Umar stressed that conversion to Islam provided exemption from , though not from .

Amr ibn al-As, after conquering Egypt, made a census for the according to wealth classes, so that the rich paid more. Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan reformed taxes in Mesopotamia based on a calculation of the income and expenses of a typical man, determining that each adult could pay of 4 dinars, a 400% increase over the previous tax; however, this burden seemingly did not increase conversions to Islam.

The Cairo Geniza records demonstrate the poll tax collection becoming very strict and burdensome for the Jewish community in Egypt during the 12th century. Evidence suggests that the guardian of a minor was responsible to pay the full poll tax on his behalf until the age of ten. Even the very sick and poor widows were subject to the tax. Shelomo Dov Goitein concluded that the intolerable burden of the might have caused the mass conversion of Jews in Egypt to Islam, while more prominent Jews embraced Islam for the possibility of government positions.

The treaty of 1535, known as the Franco-Ottoman alliance, revolutionized relations between the Christian and Islamic states, with the poll tax playing a significant role. Previously, a non-Muslim living in Muslim territory for more than a year became liable to the poll tax. Under the treaty, French Christians in the Ottoman Empire were exempted from all . In 1855, the Ottoman Empire abolished the tax as part of reforms to equalize the status of Muslims and non-Muslims. It was replaced by a military-exemption tax on non-Muslims, the . It was once believed that the Islamic poll tax derived from a previous Byzantine poll tax, but evidence for this tax has been re-dated to Islamic times.

 reemerged in 2014 after the Islamic State conquered some parts of Iraq and Syria. Its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared that Christians would face the choice of conversion, , or death. This ultimatum was read out in mosques. Many Christians fled Mosul, home to the ancient Christian communities of Iraq, leading Louis Raphaël I Sako to say: &quot;For the first time in the history of Iraq, Mosul is now empty of Christians.&quot; ISIS issued the same ultimatum in its capital of Raqqa, Syria, demanding of pure gold from Christians in exchange for their safety.

==Canada==

The Chinese head tax was a fixed fee charged to each Chinese person entering Canada. The head tax was first levied after the Canadian parliament passed the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 and was meant to discourage Chinese people from entering Canada after the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway. The tax was abolished by the Chinese Immigration Act of 1923, which stopped all Chinese immigration except for business people, clergy, educators, students, and other categories. The 1923 act was repealed in 1947.

==Ceylon==
In Ceylon, a poll tax was levied by the British colonial government of Ceylon in 1920. The tax charged 2 rupees per year per male adult. Those who did not pay had to work on the roads for one day in lieu of the tax. The Young Lanka League protested the tax, led by A. Ekanayake Gunasinha, and it was repealed by the Legislative Council of Ceylon in 1925 following a motion submitted by C. H. Z. Fernando.

==Great Britain==
The poll tax was essentially a lay subsidy, a tax on the movable property of most of the population, to help fund war. It had first been levied in 1275 and continued under different names until the 17th century. People were taxed a percentage of the assessed value of their movable goods. That percentage varied from year to year and place to place, and which goods could be taxed differed between urban and rural locations. Churchmen were exempt, as were the poor, workers in the Royal Mint, inhabitants of the Cinque Ports, tin workers in Cornwall and Devon, and those who lived in the Palatinate counties of Cheshire and Durham.

===14th century===

The Hilary Parliament, held between January and March 1377, levied a poll tax in 1377 to finance the war against France at the request of John of Gaunt who, since King Edward III was mortally sick, was the de facto head of government at the time. This tax covered almost 60% of the population, far more than lay subsidies had earlier. It was levied two more times, in 1379 and 1381. Each time the taxation basis was slightly different. In 1377, every lay person over the age of 14 years who was not a beggar had to pay a groat (4d) to the Crown. By 1379 that had been graded by social class, with the lower age limit changed to 16, and to 15 two years later. The levy of 1381 operated under a combination of both flat rate and graduated assessments. The minimum amount payable was set at 4d, however tax collectors had to account for a 12d a head mean assessment. Payments were therefore variable; the poorest would theoretically pay the lowest rate, with the deficit being met by a higher payment from those able to afford it. The 1381 tax has been credited as one of the main reasons behind the Peasants&#x27; Revolt in that year, due in part to attempts to restore feudal conditions in rural areas.

===17th century===
The poll tax was resurrected during the 17th century, usually related to a military emergency. It was imposed by Charles I in 1641 to finance the raising of the army against the Scottish and Irish uprisings. With the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the Convention Parliament of 1660 instituted a poll tax to finance the disbanding of the New Model Army (pay arrears, etc.) (12 Cha. 2. c. 9). The poll tax was assessed according to &quot;rank&quot;, e.g. dukes paid £100, earls £60, knights £20, esquires £10. Eldest sons paid two-thirds of their father&#x27;s rank, widows paid a third of their late husband&#x27;s rank. The members of the livery companies paid according to company&#x27;s rank (e.g. masters of first-tier guilds like the Mercers paid £10, whereas masters of fifth-tier guilds, like the Clerks, paid 5 shillings). Professionals also paid differing rates, e.g. physicians (£10), judges (£20), advocates (£5), attorneys (£3), and so on. Anyone with property (land, etc.) paid 40 shillings per £100 earned, anyone over the age of 16 and unmarried paid twelvepence and everyone else over 16 paid sixpence.
To finance the Nine Years&#x27; War, a poll tax was imposed again by William III and Mary II in 1689 (1 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 13), reassessed in 1690 adjusting rank for fortune (2 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 2), and then again in 1691 back to rank irrespective of fortune (3 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 6). The poll tax was imposed again in 1692 (5 &amp; 6 Will. &amp; Mar. c. 14), and one final time in 1698 (9 Will. 3. c. 38), the last poll tax in England until the 20th century.

A poll tax (&quot;polemoney&quot;) was simultaneously imposed in Scotland by the Edinburgh parliament in 1693, again in 1695, and two in 1698.

As the greater weight of the 17th century poll taxes fell primarily upon the wealthy and powerful, it was not too unpopular. There were grumblings within the taxed ranks about lack of differentiation by income within ranks. Ultimately, it was the inefficiency of their collection (what they brought in routinely fell far short of expected revenues) that prompted the government to abandon the poll tax after 1698.

Far more controversial was the hearth tax introduced by the Fire-Hearth and Stoves Taxation Act 1662 (14 Cha. 2. c. 10), which imposed a hefty two shillings on every hearth in a family dwelling, which was easier to count than persons. Heavier, more permanent and more regressive than the poll tax proper, the intrusive entry of tax inspectors into private homes to count hearths was a very sore point, and it was promptly repealed with the Glorious Revolution in 1689. It was replaced with a &quot;window tax&quot; in 1695 since inspectors could count windows from outside homes.

===20th century===

The Community Charge, popularly dubbed the &quot;poll tax&quot;, was a tax to fund local government, instituted in 1989 by the government of Margaret Thatcher. It replaced the rates that were based on the notional rental value of a house. The abolition of rates was in the Conservative Party manifesto for the 1979 general election; the replacement was proposed in the Green Paper of 1986, &quot;Paying for Local Government&quot; based on ideas developed by Dr. Madsen Pirie and Douglas Mason of the Adam Smith Institute. It was a fixed tax per adult resident, but there was a reduction for those with lower household income. Each person was to pay for the services provided in their community. This proposal was contained in the Conservative Party manifesto for the 1987 general election. The new tax replaced the rates in Scotland from the start of the 1988/89 financial year and in England and Wales from the start of the 1990/91 financial year.

The system was very unpopular since many thought it shifted the tax burden from the rich to the poor, as it was based on the number of occupants living in a house, rather than on the estimated market value of the house. Many tax rates set by local councils proved to be much higher than earlier predictions since the councils realized that not they, but the central government would be blamed for the tax, which led to resentment, even among some who had supported the introduction of it. The tax in different boroughs differed because local taxes paid by businesses varied and grants by central government to local authorities sometimes varied capriciously.

Mass protests were called by the All Britain Anti-Poll Tax Federation with which the vast majority of local Anti-Poll Tax Unions (APTUs) were affiliated. In Scotland, the APTUs called for mass nonpayment, which rapidly gathered widespread support and spread as far as England and Wales even though non-payment meant that people could be prosecuted. In some areas, 30% of former ratepayers defaulted. While owner-occupiers were easy to tax, nonpayers who regularly changed accommodation were almost impossible to trace. The cost of collecting the tax rose steeply, and its returns fell. Unrest grew and resulted in a number of poll tax riots. The most serious was in a protest at Trafalgar Square, London, on 31 March 1990, of more than 200,000 protesters. Terry Fields, Labour MP for Liverpool Broadgreen, was jailed for 60 days for his refusal to pay the poll tax.

This unrest was a factor in the fall of Thatcher. Her successor, John Major, replaced the Community Charge with the Council Tax, similar to the rating system that preceded the Community Charge. The main differences were that it was levied on capital value rather than notional rental value of a property, and that it had a 25% discount for single-occupancy dwellings.

In 2015, Lord Waldegrave reflected in his memoirs that the Community Charge was all his own work and that it was a serious mistake. Although he felt the policy looked like it would work, it was implemented differently from his predictions &quot;They went gung-ho and introduced it overnight in one go, which was never my plan and I thought they must know what they were doing – but they didn&#x27;t.&quot;

==France==
In France, a poll tax, the capitation of 1695, was first imposed by King Louis XIV in 1695 as a temporary measure to finance the War of the League of Augsburg, and thus repealed in 1699. It was resumed during the War of Spanish Succession and in 1704 set on a permanent basis, remaining until the end of the &quot;Ancien regime&quot;.

Like the English poll tax, the French capitation tax was assessed on rank – for taxation persons, French society was divided in twenty-two &quot;classes&quot;, with the Dauphin (a class by himself) paying 2,000 livres, princes of the blood paying 1500 livres, and so on down to the lowest class, composed of day laborers and servants, who paid 1 livre each. The bulk of the common population was covered by four classes, paying 40, 30, 10 and 3 livres respectively. Unlike most other direct French taxes, nobles and clergy were not exempted from capitation taxes. It did, however, exempt the mendicant orders and the poor who contributed less than 40 sous.

The French clergy managed to temporarily escape capitation assessment by promising to pay a total sum of 4 million livres per annum in 1695, and then obtained permanent exemption in 1709 with a lump sum payment of 24 million livres. The &quot;Pays d&#x27;états&quot; (Brittany, Burgundy, etc.) and many towns also escaped assessment by promising annual fixed payments. The nobles did not escape assessment, but they obtained the right to appoint their own capitation tax assessors, which allowed them to escape most of the burden (in one calculation, they escaped of it).

Compounding the burden, the assessment on the capitation did not remain stable. The &quot;pays de taille personelle&quot; (basically, &quot;pays d&#x27;élection&quot;, the bulk of France and Aquitaine) secured the ability to assess the capitation tax proportionally to the taille – which effectively meant adjusting the burden heavily against the lower classes. According to the estimates of Jacques Necker in 1788, the capitation tax was so riddled in practice, that the privileged classes (nobles and clergy and towns) were largely exempt, while the lower classes were heavily crushed: the lowest peasant class, originally assessed to pay 3 livres, were now paying 24, the second lowest, assessed at 10 livres, were now paying 60 and the third-lowest assessed at 30 were paying 180. The total collection from the capitation, according to Necker in 1788, was 41 million livres, well short of the 54 million estimate, and it was projected that the revenues could have doubled if the exemptions were revoked and the original 1695 assessment properly restored.

The old capitation tax was repealed with the French Revolution and replaced, on 13 January 1791, with a new poll tax as part of the &quot;contribution personnelle mobilière&quot;, which lasted well into the late 19th century. It was fixed for every individual at &quot;three days&#x27;s labor&quot; (assessed locally, but by statute, no less than 1 franc 50 centimes and no more than 4 francs 50 centimes, depending on the area). A dwelling tax (&quot;impôt sur les portes et fenêtres&quot;, similar to the English window-tax) was imposed in 1798.

==New Zealand==

New Zealand imposed a poll tax on Chinese immigrants during the 19th and early 20th centuries as part of their broader efforts to reduce the number of Chinese immigrants. The poll tax was effectively lifted in the 1930s following the invasion of China by Japan, and was finally repealed in 1944. Prime Minister Helen Clark offered New Zealand&#x27;s Chinese community an official apology for the poll tax on 12 February 2002.

==Poland–Lithuania==

The Jewish poll tax was a poll tax imposed on the Jews in Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was later absorbed into the &quot;hiberna&quot; tax.

==Roman Empire==

The ancient Romans imposed a &quot;tributum capitis&quot; (poll tax) as one of the principal direct taxes on the peoples of the Roman provinces (&quot;Digest&quot; 50, tit.15). In the Republican period, poll taxes were principally collected by private tax farmers (&quot;publicani&quot;), but from the time of Emperor Augustus, the collections were gradually transferred to magistrates and the senates of provincial cities. The Roman census was conducted periodically in the provinces to draw up and update the poll tax register.

The Roman poll tax fell principally on Roman subjects in the provinces, but not on Roman citizens. Towns in the provinces who possessed the &quot;Jus Italicum&quot; (enjoying the &quot;privileges of Italy&quot;) were exempted from the poll tax. The 212 edict of Emperor Caracalla (which formally conferred Roman citizenship on all residents of Roman provinces) did not, however, exempt them from the poll tax.

The Roman poll tax was deeply resented—Tertullian bewailed the poll tax as a &quot;badge of slavery&quot;—and it provoked numerous revolts in the provinces.
Perhaps most famous is the Zealot revolt in Judaea of 66 AD. After the destruction of the temple in 70 AD, the Emperor Vespasian imposed an extra poll tax on Jews throughout the empire, the &quot;fiscus judaicus&quot;, of two denarii each.

==Russia==
The Russian Empire imposed a poll tax in 1718. Nikolay Bunge, Finance Minister from 1881 to 1886 under Emperor Alexander III, abolished it in 1886. Poll taxes in Imperial Russia were determined by revision list enumerations.

==United States==

===Poll tax===

Prior to the mid 20th century, a poll tax was implemented in some U.S. state and local jurisdictions and paying it was a requirement before one could exercise one&#x27;s right to vote. After this right was extended to all races by the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution, many Southern states enacted poll taxes as a means of excluding African-American voters, most of whom were poor and unable to pay a tax. So as not to disenfranchise many whites, such laws sometimes included a clause exempting any people who had voted prior to enactment of the laws. The poll tax, along with literacy tests and extra-legal intimidation, such as by the Ku Klux Klan, achieved the desired effect of disenfranchising African Americans.

Generally, In the United States, the term &quot;poll tax&quot; is used to mean a tax that must be paid in order to vote, rather than a capitation tax simply. For example, a bill that passed the Florida House of Representatives in April 2019 has been compared to a poll tax because it requires former felons to pay all &quot;financial obligations&quot; related to their sentence, including court fines, fees, and judgments, before their voting rights will be restored as required by a referendum that passed with 64% of the vote in 2018.

The Twenty-fourth Amendment, ratified in 1964, prohibits both Congress and the states from conditioning the right to vote in federal elections on payment of a poll tax or any other type of tax. Poll taxes for State and local elections were declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in &quot;Harper v. Virginia State Board of Elections&quot;.

===Capitation and federal taxation===
The ninth section of Article One of the Constitution places several limits on Congress&#x27; powers. Among them: &quot;No capitation, or other direct, tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken&quot;. Capitation here means a tax of a uniform, fixed amount per taxpayer. Direct tax means a tax levied directly by the United States federal government on taxpayers, as opposed to a tax on events or transactions. The United States government levied direct taxes from time to time during the 18th and early 19th centuries. It levied direct taxes on the owners of houses, land, slaves and estates in the late 1790s but cancelled the taxes in 1802.

An income tax is neither a poll tax nor a capitation, as the amount of tax will vary from person to person, depending on each person&#x27;s income. Until a United States Supreme Court decision in 1895, all income taxes were deemed to be excises (i.e., indirect taxes). The Revenue Act of 1861 established the first income tax in the United States, to pay for the cost of the American Civil War. This income tax was abolished after the war, in 1872. Another income tax statute in 1894 was overturned in &quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.&quot; in 1895, where the Supreme Court held that income taxes on income from property, such as rent income, interest income, and dividend income (however excepting income taxes on income from &quot;occupations and labor&quot; if only for the reason of not having been challenged in the case, &quot;We have considered the act only in respect of the tax on income derived from real estate, and from invested personal property&quot;) were to be treated as direct taxes. Because the statute in question had not apportioned income taxes on income from property by population, the statute was ruled unconstitutional. Finally, ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913 made possible modern income taxes, by limiting the Sixteenth Amendment income tax to the class of indirect excises (i.e. excises, duties, and imposts) – thus requiring no apportionment,
 a practice that would remain unchanged into the 21st century.

===Employment-based head taxes===
Various cities, including Chicago and Denver, have levied head taxes with a set rate per employee targeted at large employers. After Cupertino postponed head tax proposals to 2020, Mountain View became the only city in Silicon Valley to continue to pursue such type of taxes.

In 2018, the Seattle city council proposed a &quot;head tax&quot; of $500 per year per employee. The proposed tax was lowered to $275 per year per employee, was passed, and became &quot;the biggest head tax in U.S. history,&quot; though it was repealed less than a month later.

<doc id="24552" wikidata="Q6241" url="?curid=24552" title="Patriotism">
<text>Patriotism is the feeling of love, devotion, and a sense of attachment to a country or state. This attachment can be a combination of different feelings for things such as the language of one&#x27;s homeland, and its ethnic, cultural, political, or historical aspects. It may encompass a set of concepts closely related to nationalism, mostly civic nationalism and sometimes cultural nationalism.

== Terminology and usage ==
An excess of patriotism is called &quot;chauvinism&quot;; another related term is &quot;jingoism&quot;.

The English word &quot;patriot&quot; derived from &quot;compatriot&quot;, in the 1590s, from Middle French in the 15th century. The French word&#x27;s and originated directly from Late Latin &quot;fellow-countryman&quot; in the 6th century. From Greek &quot;fellow countryman&quot;, from &quot;of one&#x27;s fathers&quot;, &quot;fatherland&quot;. The term &quot;patriot&quot; was &quot;applied to barbarians who were perceived to be either uncivilized or primitive and who had only a common Patris or fatherland.&quot; The original European meaning of &quot;patriots&quot; applied to anyone who was a fellow countryman regardless of the socio-economic status.

The use of patriotism and nationalism originally shared a similar meaning in the 19th century, but their use and connotation gradually grown apart. The Merriam-Webster defines patriotism as &quot;love for or devotion to one’s country&quot;, whereas nationalism is defined as &quot;loyalty and devotion to a nation&quot;. Today, nationalism has gained a more negative connotation. In contrast, patriotism is used to refer to genuine pride in one&#x27;s nation, recognizing both its merits and flaws. A similar distinction between the terms was also upheld by George Orwell, whose essay &quot;Notes on Nationalism&quot;, distinguished patriotism from the related concept of nationalism:

By &#x27;patriotism&#x27; I mean devotion to a particular place and a particular way of life, which one believes to be the best in the world but has no wish to force upon other people. Patriotism is of its nature defensive, both militarily and culturally. Nationalism, on the other hand, is inseparable from the desire for power. The abiding purpose of every nationalist is to secure more power and more prestige, &quot;not&quot; for himself but for the nation or other unit in which he has chosen to sink his own individuality.

==History==
The notions of civic virtue and group dedication can be found in cultures globally throughout history. For Enlightenment thinkers of 18th-century Europe, loyalty to the state was chiefly considered in contrast to loyalty to the Church. It was argued that clerics should not be allowed to teach in public schools since their was heaven, so they could not inspire a love of the homeland in their students. One of the most influential proponents of this notion of patriotism was Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

Enlightenment thinkers also criticized what they saw as the excess of patriotism. In 1774, Samuel Johnson published &quot;The Patriot&quot;, a critique of what he viewed as false patriotism. On the evening of 7 April 1775, he made the famous statement, &quot;Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel&quot;. James Boswell, who reported this comment in his &quot;Life of Johnson&quot;, does not provide context for the quote, and it has therefore been argued that Johnson was in fact attacking a false use of &quot;patriotism&quot; by contemporaries such as John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute (the patriot-minister) and his supporters; Johnson spoke elsewhere in favor of what he considered &quot;true&quot; patriotism. However, there is no direct evidence to contradict the widely held belief that Johnson&#x27;s famous remark was a criticism of patriotism itself.

==Cultural aspects==
Many patriotic people take pride in sharing a distinct, common culture, believing it to be central to their national identity and unity. Many are devoted to the preservation of their traditional culture and encourage cultural assimilation by people from other cultures. However, some of the more civic forms of patriotism tend to de-emphasize ethnic culture in favor of a shared political culture.

==Philosophical issues==
Patriotism may be strengthened by adherence to a national religion (a civil religion or even a theocracy). This is the opposite of the separation of church and state demanded by the Enlightenment thinkers who saw patriotism and faith as similar and opposed forces. Michael Billig and Jean Bethke Elshtain both argued that the difference between patriotism and faith is difficult to discern and relies largely on the attitude of the one doing the labeling.

Christopher Heath Wellman, professor of philosophy at Washington University in St. Louis, says a popular view of the &quot;patriotist&quot; position is robust obligations to compatriots and only minimal samaritan responsibilities to foreigners. Wellman calls this position &quot;patriotist&quot; rather than &quot;nationalist&quot; to single out the members of territorial, political units rather than cultural groups.

=== Opposition ===

Voltaire stated that &quot;It is lamentable, that to be a good patriot one must become the enemy of the rest of mankind.&quot; Arthur Schopenhauer wrote that &quot;The cheapest sort of pride is national pride; for if a man is proud of his own nation, it argues that he has no qualities of his own of which a person can be proud.&quot;

Kōtoku Shūsui, a famous Japanese anarchist of the late 19th/early 20th century, devoted a large section of his widely read &quot;Imperialism, Monster of the Twentieth Century&quot; to a condemnation of patriotism. One of the many arguments is based on the Confucian value of empathy: &quot;I am as convinced as Mencius that any man would rush without hesitation to rescue a child who was about to fall into a well... A human being moved by such selfless love and charity does not pause to think whether the child is a family member or a close relative. When he rescues the child from danger, he does not even ask himself whether the child is his own or belongs to another.&quot; Patriotism is used to dehumanize others whom we would naturally have empathy for. He argues, &quot;[P]atriotism is a discriminating and arbitrary sentiment confined to those who belong to a single nation-state or live together within common national borders&quot;, a sentiment cultivated and used by militarists in their drive for war. 

Marxists have taken various stances regarding patriotism. On one hand, Karl Marx famously stated that &quot;The working men have no country&quot; and that &quot;the supremacy of the proletariat will cause [national differences] to vanish still faster.&quot; The same view is promoted by present-day Trotskyists such as Alan Woods, who is &quot;in favor of tearing down all frontiers and creating a socialist world commonwealth.&quot; On the other hand, Marxist-Leninists and Maoists are usually in favor of socialist patriotism based on the theory of socialism in one country.

Against primordial arguments in favour of national patriotism, Eric Hobsbawm wrote that such a concept was - for most of human history - &quot;so remote from the real experience of most human beings&quot;.

Anarchists oppose patriotism. This was exemplified by Emma Goldman, who stated: Indeed, conceit, arrogance, and egotism are the essentials of patriotism. Let me illustrate. Patriotism assumes that our globe is divided into little spots, each one surrounded by an iron gate. Those who have had the fortune of being born on some particular spot, consider themselves better, nobler, grander, and more intelligent than the living beings inhabiting any other spot. It is, therefore, the duty of everyone living in that chosen spot to fight, kill, and die in an attempt to impose his superiority upon all the others.

===Region-specific issues===
In the European Union, thinkers such as Jürgen Habermas have advocated a &quot;Euro-patriotism&quot;, but patriotism in Europe is usually directed at the nation-state and more often than not coincides with &quot;Euroscepticism&quot;.

==Surveys==
Several surveys have tried to measure patriotism, such as the Correlates of War project which found some correlation between war propensity and patriotism. The results from different studies are time-dependent. For example, according to the project, patriotism in Germany before World War I ranked at or near the top . According to a study by the Identity Foundation, 60% of Germans were proud of their country in 2009. According to Statista, the figure was as high as 83%. In a 2020 Pew Research Center survey, 53% of participants surveyed in Germany said they were proud of their country, the highest figure among the nations surveyed (France (45 %), United Kingdom (41 %), United States (39 %)).

, the World Values Survey polls for national values and beliefs. The survey includes the question &quot;Are you proud to be [insert nationality]?&quot;; the answers to which range from 1 (not proud) to 4 (very proud). They then use the average answer given to create comparisons between not only nations but also high and low income citizens.

In 2022, U.S. adults who said they were &quot;extremely proud&quot; to be an American hit an all-time low, according to a Gallup poll.

<doc id="24553" wikidata="Q211935" url="?curid=24553" title="Protein biosynthesis">
<text>Protein biosynthesis (or protein synthesis) is a core biological process, occurring inside cells, balancing the loss of cellular proteins (via degradation or export) through the production of new proteins. Proteins perform a number of critical functions as enzymes, structural proteins or hormones. Protein synthesis is a very similar process for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes but there are some distinct differences.

Protein synthesis can be divided broadly into two phases: transcription and translation. During transcription, a section of DNA encoding a protein, known as a gene, is converted into a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA). This conversion is carried out by enzymes, known as RNA polymerases, in the nucleus of the cell. In eukaryotes, this mRNA is initially produced in a premature form (pre-mRNA) which undergoes post-transcriptional modifications to produce mature mRNA. The mature mRNA is exported from the cell nucleus via nuclear pores to the cytoplasm of the cell for translation to occur. During translation, the mRNA is read by ribosomes which use the nucleotide sequence of the mRNA to determine the sequence of amino acids. The ribosomes catalyze the formation of covalent peptide bonds between the encoded amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.

Following translation the polypeptide chain must fold to form a functional protein; for example, to function as an enzyme the polypeptide chain must fold correctly to produce a functional active site. To adopt a functional three-dimensional shape, the polypeptide chain must first form a series of smaller underlying structures called secondary structures. The polypeptide chain in these secondary structures then folds to produce the overall 3D tertiary structure. Once correctly folded, the protein can undergo further maturation through different post-translational modifications, which can alter the protein&#x27;s ability to function, its location within the cell (e.g. cytoplasm or nucleus) and its ability to interact with other proteins.

Protein biosynthesis has a key role in disease as changes and errors in this process, through underlying DNA mutations or protein misfolding, are often the underlying causes of a disease. DNA mutations change the subsequent mRNA sequence, which then alters the mRNA encoded amino acid sequence. Mutations can cause the polypeptide chain to be shorter by generating a stop sequence which causes early termination of translation. Alternatively, a mutation in the mRNA sequence changes the specific amino acid encoded at that position in the polypeptide chain. This amino acid change can impact the protein&#x27;s ability to function or to fold correctly. Misfolded proteins have a tendency to form dense protein clumps, which are often implicated in diseases, particularly neurological disorders including Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

==Transcription==
Transcription occurs in the nucleus using DNA as a template to produce mRNA. In eukaryotes, this mRNA molecule is known as pre-mRNA as it undergoes post-transcriptional modifications in the nucleus to produce a mature mRNA molecule. However, in prokaryotes post-transcriptional modifications are not required so the mature mRNA molecule is immediately produced by transcription.
Initially, an enzyme known as a helicase acts on the molecule of DNA. DNA has an antiparallel, double helix structure composed of two, complementary polynucleotide strands, held together by hydrogen bonds between the base pairs. The helicase disrupts the hydrogen bonds causing a region of DNAcorresponding to a geneto unwind, separating the two DNA strands and exposing a series of bases. Despite DNA being a double-stranded molecule, only one of the strands acts as a template for pre-mRNA synthesis; this strand is known as the template strand. The other DNA strand (which is complementary to the template strand) is known as the coding strand.

Both DNA and RNA have intrinsic directionality, meaning there are two distinct ends of the molecule. This property of directionality is due to the asymmetrical underlying nucleotide subunits, with a phosphate group on one side of the pentose sugar and a base on the other. The five carbons in the pentose sugar are numbered from 1&#x27; (where &#x27; means prime) to 5&#x27;. Therefore, the phosphodiester bonds connecting the nucleotides are formed by joining the hydroxyl group on the 3&#x27; carbon of one nucleotide to the phosphate group on the 5&#x27; carbon of another nucleotide. Hence, the coding strand of DNA runs in a 5&#x27; to 3&#x27; direction and the complementary, template DNA strand runs in the opposite direction from 3&#x27; to 5&#x27;.
The enzyme RNA polymerase binds to the exposed template strand and reads from the gene in the 3&#x27; to 5&#x27; direction. Simultaneously, the RNA polymerase synthesizes a single strand of pre-mRNA in the 5&#x27;-to-3&#x27; direction by catalysing the formation of phosphodiester bonds between activated nucleotides (free in the nucleus) that are capable of complementary base pairing with the template strand. Behind the moving RNA polymerase the two strands of DNA rejoin, so only 12 base pairs of DNA are exposed at one time. RNA polymerase builds the pre-mRNA molecule at a rate of 20 nucleotides per second enabling the production of thousands of pre-mRNA molecules from the same gene in an hour. Despite the fast rate of synthesis, the RNA polymerase enzyme contains its own proofreading mechanism. The proofreading mechanisms allows the RNA polymerase to remove incorrect nucleotides (which are not complementary to the template strand of DNA) from the growing pre-mRNA molecule through an excision reaction. When RNA polymerases reaches a specific DNA sequence which terminates transcription, RNA polymerase detaches and pre-mRNA synthesis is complete.

The pre-mRNA molecule synthesized is complementary to the template DNA strand and shares the same nucleotide sequence as the coding DNA strand. However, there is one crucial difference in the nucleotide composition of DNA and mRNA molecules. DNA is composed of the bases: guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine (G, C, A and T). RNA is also composed of four bases: guanine, cytosine, adenine and uracil. In RNA molecules, the DNA base thymine is replaced by uracil which is able to base pair with adenine. Therefore, in the pre-mRNA molecule, all complementary bases which would be thymine in the coding DNA strand are replaced by uracil.

===Post-transcriptional modifications===
Once transcription is complete, the pre-mRNA molecule undergoes post-transcriptional modifications to produce a mature mRNA molecule.

There are 3 key steps within post-transcriptional modifications:
# Addition of a 5&#x27; cap to the 5&#x27; end of the pre-mRNA molecule
# Addition of a 3&#x27; poly(A) tail is added to the 3&#x27; end pre-mRNA molecule
# Removal of introns via RNA splicing
The 5&#x27; cap is added to the 5&#x27; end of the pre-mRNA molecule and is composed of a guanine nucleotide modified through methylation. The purpose of the 5&#x27; cap is to prevent break down of mature mRNA molecules before translation, the cap also aids binding of the ribosome to the mRNA to start translation and enables mRNA to be differentiated from other RNAs in the cell. In contrast, the 3&#x27; Poly(A) tail is added to the 3&#x27; end of the mRNA molecule and is composed of 100-200 adenine bases. These distinct mRNA modifications enable the cell to detect that the full mRNA message is intact if both the 5&#x27; cap and 3&#x27; tail are present.

This modified pre-mRNA molecule then undergoes the process of RNA splicing. Genes are composed of a series of introns and exons, introns are nucleotide sequences which do not encode a protein while, exons are nucleotide sequences that directly encode a protein. Introns and exons are present in both the underlying DNA sequence and the pre-mRNA molecule, therefore, to produce a mature mRNA molecule encoding a protein, splicing must occur. During splicing, the intervening introns are removed from the pre-mRNA molecule by a multi-protein complex known as a spliceosome (composed of over 150 proteins and RNA). This mature mRNA molecule is then exported into the cytoplasm through nuclear pores in the envelope of the nucleus.

==Translation==

During translation, ribosomes synthesize polypeptide chains from mRNA template molecules. In eukaryotes, translation occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell, where the ribosomes are located either free floating or attached to the endoplasmic reticulum. In prokaryotes, which lack a nucleus, the processes of both transcription and translation occur in the cytoplasm.

Ribosomes are complex molecular machines, made of a mixture of protein and ribosomal RNA, arranged into two subunits (a large and a small subunit), which surround the mRNA molecule. The ribosome reads the mRNA molecule in a 5&#x27;-3&#x27; direction and uses it as a template to determine the order of amino acids in the polypeptide chain. To translate the mRNA molecule, the ribosome uses small molecules, known as transfer RNAs (tRNA), to deliver the correct amino acids to the ribosome. Each tRNA is composed of 70-80 nucleotides and adopts a characteristic cloverleaf structure due to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the nucleotides within the molecule. There are around 60 different types of tRNAs, each tRNA binds to a specific sequence of three nucleotides (known as a codon) within the mRNA molecule and delivers a specific amino acid.

The ribosome initially attaches to the mRNA at the start codon (AUG) and begins to translate the molecule. The mRNA nucleotide sequence is read in triplets; three adjacent nucleotides in the mRNA molecule correspond to a single codon. Each tRNA has an exposed sequence of three nucleotides, known as the anticodon, which are complementary in sequence to a specific codon that may be present in mRNA. For example, the first codon encountered is the start codon composed of the nucleotides AUG. The correct tRNA with the anticodon (complementary 3 nucleotide sequence UAC) binds to the mRNA using the ribosome. This tRNA delivers the correct amino acid corresponding to the mRNA codon, in the case of the start codon, this is the amino acid methionine. The next codon (adjacent to the start codon) is then bound by the correct tRNA with complementary anticodon, delivering the next amino acid to ribosome. The ribosome then uses its peptidyl transferase enzymatic activity to catalyze the formation of the covalent peptide bond between the two adjacent amino acids.

The ribosome then moves along the mRNA molecule to the third codon. The ribosome then releases the first tRNA molecule, as only two tRNA molecules can be brought together by a single ribosome at one time. The next complementary tRNA with the correct anticodon complementary to the third codon is selected, delivering the next amino acid to the ribosome which is covalently joined to the growing polypeptide chain. This process continues with the ribosome moving along the mRNA molecule adding up to 15 amino acids per second to the polypeptide chain. Behind the first ribosome, up to 50 additional ribosomes can bind to the mRNA molecule forming a polysome, this enables simultaneous synthesis of multiple identical polypeptide chains. Termination of the growing polypeptide chain occurs when the ribosome encounters a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the mRNA molecule. When this occurs, no tRNA can recognise it and a release factor induces the release of the complete polypeptide chain from the ribosome. Dr. Har Gobind Khorana, a scientist originating from India, decoded the RNA sequences for about 20 amino acids. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968, along with two other scientists, for his work.

==Protein folding==
Once synthesis of the polypeptide chain is complete, the polypeptide chain folds to adopt a specific structure which enables the protein to carry out its functions. The basic form of protein structure is known as the primary structure, which is simply the polypeptide chain i.e. a sequence of covalently bonded amino acids. The primary structure of a protein is encoded by a gene. Therefore, any changes to the sequence of the gene can alter the primary structure of the protein and all subsequent levels of protein structure, ultimately changing the overall structure and function.

The primary structure of a protein (the polypeptide chain) can then fold or coil to form the secondary structure of the protein. The most common types of secondary structure are known as an alpha helix or beta sheet, these are small structures produced by hydrogen bonds forming within the polypeptide chain. This secondary structure then folds to produce the tertiary structure of the protein. The tertiary structure is the proteins overall 3D structure which is made of different secondary structures folding together. In the tertiary structure, key protein features e.g. the active site, are folded and formed enabling the protein to function. Finally, some proteins may adopt a complex quaternary structure. Most proteins are made of a single polypeptide chain, however, some proteins are composed of multiple polypeptide chains (known as subunits) which fold and interact to form the quaternary structure. Hence, the overall protein is a multi-subunit complex composed of multiple folded, polypeptide chain subunits e.g. haemoglobin.

== Post-translation events ==
There are events that follow protein biosynthesis such as proteolysis and protein-folding. Proteolysis refers to the cleavage of proteins by proteases and the breakdown of proteins into amino acids by the action of enzymes.

==Post-translational modifications==
When protein folding into the mature, functional 3D state is complete, it is not necessarily the end of the protein maturation pathway. A folded protein can still undergo further processing through post-translational modifications. There are over 200 known types of post-translational modification, these modifications can alter protein activity, the ability of the protein to interact with other proteins and where the protein is found within the cell e.g. in the cell nucleus or cytoplasm. Through post-translational modifications, the diversity of proteins encoded by the genome is expanded by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude.

There are four key classes of post-translational modification:
# Cleavage
# Addition of chemical groups
# Addition of complex molecules
# Formation of intramolecular bonds

===Cleavage===

Cleavage of proteins is an irreversible post-translational modification carried out by enzymes known as proteases. These proteases are often highly specific and cause hydrolysis of a limited number of peptide bonds within the target protein. The resulting shortened protein has an altered polypeptide chain with different amino acids at the start and end of the chain. This post-translational modification often alters the proteins function, the protein can be inactivated or activated by the cleavage and can display new biological activities.

===Addition of chemical groups===

Following translation, small chemical groups can be added onto amino acids within the mature protein structure. Examples of processes which add chemical groups to the target protein include methylation, acetylation and phosphorylation.

Methylation is the reversible addition of a methyl group onto an amino acid catalyzed by methyltransferase enzymes. Methylation occurs on at least 9 of the 20 common amino acids, however, it mainly occurs on the amino acids lysine and arginine. One example of a protein which is commonly methylated is a histone. Histones are proteins found in the nucleus of the cell. DNA is tightly wrapped round histones and held in place by other proteins and interactions between negative charges in the DNA and positive charges on the histone. A highly specific pattern of amino acid methylation on the histone proteins is used to determine which regions of DNA are tightly wound and unable to be transcribed and which regions are loosely wound and able to be transcribed.

Histone-based regulation of DNA transcription is also modified by acetylation. Acetylation is the reversible covalent addition of an acetyl group onto a lysine amino acid by the enzyme acetyltransferase. The acetyl group is removed from a donor molecule known as acetyl coenzyme A and transferred onto the target protein. Histones undergo acetylation on their lysine residues by enzymes known as histone acetyltransferase. The effect of acetylation is to weaken the charge interactions between the histone and DNA, thereby making more genes in the DNA accessible for transcription.

The final, prevalent post-translational chemical group modification is phosphorylation. Phosphorylation is the reversible, covalent addition of a phosphate group to specific amino acids (serine, threonine and tyrosine) within the protein. The phosphate group is removed from the donor molecule ATP by a protein kinase and transferred onto the hydroxyl group of the target amino acid, this produces adenosine diphosphate as a byproduct. This process can be reversed and the phosphate group removed by the enzyme protein phosphatase. Phosphorylation can create a binding site on the phosphorylated protein which enables it to interact with other proteins and generate large, multi-protein complexes. Alternatively, phosphorylation can change the level of protein activity by altering the ability of the protein to bind its substrate.

===Addition of complex molecules===

Post-translational modifications can incorporate more complex, large molecules into the folded protein structure. One common example of this is glycosylation, the addition of a polysaccharide molecule, which is widely considered to be most common post-translational modification.

In glycosylation, a polysaccharide molecule (known as a glycan) is covalently added to the target protein by glycosyltransferases enzymes and modified by glycosidases in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Glycosylation can have a critical role in determining the final, folded 3D structure of the target protein. In some cases glycosylation is necessary for correct folding. N-linked glycosylation promotes protein folding by increasing solubility and mediates the protein binding to protein chaperones. Chaperones are proteins responsible for folding and maintaining the structure of other proteins.

There are broadly two types of glycosylation, N-linked glycosylation and O-linked glycosylation. N-linked glycosylation starts in the endoplasmic reticulum with the addition of a precursor glycan. The precursor glycan is modified in the Golgi apparatus to produce complex glycan bound covalently to the nitrogen in an asparagine amino acid. In contrast, O-linked glycosylation is the sequential covalent addition of individual sugars onto the oxygen in the amino acids serine and threonine within the mature protein structure.

===Formation of covalent bonds===

Many proteins produced within the cell are secreted outside the cell to function as extracellular proteins. Extracellular proteins are exposed to a wide variety of conditions. To stabilize the 3D protein structure, covalent bonds are formed either within the protein or between the different polypeptide chains in the quaternary structure. The most prevalent type is a disulfide bond (also known as a disulfide bridge). A disulfide bond is formed between two cysteine amino acids using their side chain chemical groups containing a Sulphur atom, these chemical groups are known as thiol functional groups. Disulfide bonds act to stabilize the pre-existing structure of the protein. Disulfide bonds are formed in an oxidation reaction between two thiol groups and therefore, need an oxidizing environment to react. As a result, disulfide bonds are typically formed in the oxidizing environment of the endoplasmic reticulum catalyzed by enzymes called protein disulfide isomerases. Disulfide bonds are rarely formed in the cytoplasm as it is a reducing environment.

==Role of protein synthesis in disease==
Many diseases are caused by mutations in genes, due to the direct connection between the DNA nucleotide sequence and the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein. Changes to the primary structure of the protein can result in the protein mis-folding or malfunctioning. Mutations within a single gene have been identified as a cause of multiple diseases, including sickle cell disease, known as single gene disorders.

===Sickle cell disease===
Sickle cell disease is a group of diseases caused by a mutation in a subunit of hemoglobin, a protein found in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen. The most dangerous of the sickle cell diseases is known as sickle cell anemia. Sickle cell anemia is the most common homozygous recessive single gene disorder, meaning the affected individual must carry a mutation in both copies of the affected gene (one inherited from each parent) to experience the disease. Hemoglobin has a complex quaternary structure and is composed of four polypeptide subunitstwo A subunits and two B subunits. Patients with sickle cell anemia have a missense or substitution mutation in the gene encoding the hemoglobin B subunit polypeptide chain. A missense mutation means the nucleotide mutation alters the overall codon triplet such that a different amino acid is paired with the new codon. In the case of sickle cell anemia, the most common missense mutation is a single nucleotide mutation from thymine to adenine in the hemoglobin B subunit gene. This changes codon 6 from encoding the amino acid glutamic acid to encoding valine.

This change in the primary structure of the hemoglobin B subunit polypeptide chain alters the functionality of the hemoglobin multi-subunit complex in low oxygen conditions. When red blood cells unload oxygen into the tissues of the body, the mutated haemoglobin protein starts to stick together to form a semi-solid structure within the red blood cell. This distorts the shape of the red blood cell, resulting in the characteristic &quot;sickle&quot; shape, and reduces cell flexibility. This rigid, distorted red blood cell can accumulate in blood vessels creating a blockage. The blockage prevents blood flow to tissues and can lead to tissue death which causes great pain to the individual.

=== Cancer ===

Cancers form as a result of gene mutations as well as improper protein translation. In addition to cancer cells proliferating abnormally, they suppress the expression of anti-apoptotic or pro-apoptotic genes or proteins. Most cancer cells see a mutation in the signaling protein Ras, which functions as an on/off signal transductor in cells. In cancer cells, the RAS protein becomes persistently active, thus promoting the proliferation of the cell due to the absence of any regulation. Additionally, most cancer cells carry two mutant copies of the regulator gene p53, which acts as a gatekeeper for damaged genes and initiates apoptosis in malignant cells. In its absence, the cell cannot initiate apoptosis or signal for other cells to destroy it.

As the tumor cells proliferate, they either remain confined to one area and are called benign, or become malignant cells that migrate to other areas of the body. Oftentimes, these malignant cells secrete proteases that break apart the extracellular matrix of tissues. This then allows the cancer to enter its terminal stage called Metastasis, in which the cells enter the bloodstream or the lymphatic system to travel to a new part of the body.

<text>A photosynthetic pigment (accessory pigment; chloroplast pigment; antenna pigment) is a pigment that is present in chloroplasts or photosynthetic bacteria and captures the light energy necessary for photosynthesis.

List of photosynthetic pigments (in order of increasing polarity):
*Carotene: an orange pigment
*Xanthophyll: a yellow pigment
*Phaeophytin &quot;a&quot;: a gray-brown pigment
*Phaeophytin &quot;b&quot;: a yellow-brown pigment
*Chlorophyll &quot;a&quot;: a blue-green pigment
*Chlorophyll &quot;b&quot;: a yellow-green pigment

Chlorophyll &quot;a&quot; is the most common of the six, present in every plant that performs photosynthesis. Each pigment absorbs light more efficiently in a different part of the electromagnetic spectrum. well in the ranges of 400–450 nm and at 650–700 nm; chlorophyll &quot;b&quot; at 450–500 nm and at 600–650 nm. Xanthophyll absorbs well at 400–530 nm. However, none of the pigments absorb well in the green-yellow region; the diffuse reflection of the unabsorbed green light is responsible for the abundant green seen in nature. 

==Bacteria==
Like plants, the cyanobacteria use water as an electron donor for photosynthesis and therefore liberate oxygen; they also use chlorophyll as a pigment. In addition, most cyanobacteria use phycobiliproteins, water-soluble pigments which occur in the cytoplasm of the chloroplast, to capture light energy and pass it on to the chlorophylls. (Some cyanobacteria, the prochlorophytes, use chlorophyll b instead of phycobilin.) It is thought that the chloroplasts in plants and algae all evolved from cyanobacteria.

Several other groups of bacteria use the bacteriochlorophyll pigments (similar to the chlorophylls) for photosynthesis. Unlike the cyanobacteria, these bacteria do not produce oxygen; they typically use hydrogen sulfide rather than water as the electron donor.

Recently, a very different pigment has been found in some marine Gammaproteobacteria: proteorhodopsin. It is similar to and probably originated from bacteriorhodopsin (see below: under #Archaea).

==Archaea==

Halobacteria use the pigment bacteriorhodopsin which acts directly as a proton pump when exposed to light.

<text>Peter James Carroll (born 1953) is an English occultist and writer. He is one of the originators of chaos magic theory, a cofounder of the Illuminates of Thanateros, and the founder and chancellor of Arcanorium College.

==Career==
In the late 1970s, Peter Carroll and Ray Sherwin, two young British occultists interested in ritual magic, began to publish a magazine called &quot;The New Equinox&quot;. Both men were connected with a burgeoning occult scene developing around The Phoenix, a metaphysical bookshop in London&#x27;s East End. Having grown dissatisfied with the state of the magical arts and the deficiencies they saw in the available occult groups, they published a small announcement in a 1978 issue of their magazine, announcing the creation of the Illuminates of Thanateros (IOT), which has been described as &quot;an unprecedented attempt of institutionalising one of the most individualising currents in the history of &#x27;Western learned magic&#x27;&quot;.

Carroll first issued &quot;Liber Null&quot; in 1978 and &quot;Psychonaut&quot; in 1982. They were published together in the 1987 book &quot;Liber Null &amp; Psychonaut&quot;, which is considered one of the defining works of the chaos magic movement. He has also written columns for the &quot;Chaos International&quot; magazine under the names Pete Carroll and &quot;Stokastikos&quot;.

Carroll elaborated a system heavily influenced by Austin Osman Spare in his early writings, particularly &quot;Liber Null&quot; (1978). However, somewhat confusingly, Carroll uses the term &#x27;Kia&#x27; to refer to the consciousness of the individual: &quot;the elusive &#x27;I&#x27; which confers self-awareness&quot;. The more general universal force, of which Kia is an aspect, Carroll termed &#x27;Chaos&#x27;: &quot;The unity which appears to the mind to exert the twin functions of will and perception is called &quot;Kia&quot; by magicians. Sometimes it is called the spirit, or soul, or life force, instead... Kia is capable of occult power because it is a fragment of the great life force of the universe... The &quot;thing&quot; responsible for the origin and continued action of events is called &quot;Chaos&quot; by magicians... Chaos... is the force which has caused life to evolve itself out of dust, and is currently most concentratedly manifest in the human life force, or Kia, where it is the source of consciousness... To the extent that the Kia can become one with Chaos it can extend its will and perception into the universe to accomplish magic.&quot;

In 1995, Carroll announced his desire to step down from the &quot;roles of magus and pontiff of chaos&quot;. This statement was originally delivered at the same IOT international meeting which Carroll discussed in an article titled &quot;The Ice War&quot; in &quot;Chaos International&quot;.

In 2005, he appeared as a chaos magic instructor at Maybe Logic Academy at the request of Robert Anton Wilson.

==Holy Guardian Angel==
Carroll split the concept of the Holy Guardian Angel in two and speaks of two Holy Guardian Angels. According to his work &quot;Liber Null and Psychonaut&quot;, one is the Augoeides, a projected image of whatever the magician strives for; the other is quantum uncertainty, which ultimately determines the acts of the magician and is a spark of the only true creative force, the chaos of chaos magic.

<doc id="24560" wikidata="Q4165237" url="?curid=24560" title="Intact dilation and extraction">
<text>Intact dilation and extraction (D&amp;X, IDX, or intact D&amp;E) is a surgical procedure that terminates and removes an intact fetus from the uterus. The procedure is used both after miscarriages and for abortions in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. When used to perform an abortion, an intact D&amp;E can occur after feticide or on a live fetus.

In the United States, where federal law describes an intact D&amp;E on a live fetus as a partial-birth abortion, the procedure is uncommon. For example, in 2000, only 0.17% of all abortions in the United States (2,232 of 1,313,000) were performed using an intact D&amp;E. Around that time, its usage became a focal point of the U.S. abortion debate. The 2003 federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which was upheld by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot;, outlaws an intact D&amp;E of a fetus with a heartbeat under most, though not all, circumstances.

== Indications ==
As with non-intact D&amp;E or labor induction in the second trimester, the purpose of D&amp;E is to end a pregnancy by removing the fetus and placenta. Patients who have a fetus diagnosed with severe congenital anomalies may prefer an intact procedure to allow for viewing of the remains, grieving, and achieving closure. In cases where an autopsy has been requested, an intact procedure allows for a more complete examination of the body.

An intact D&amp;E is also used in abortions to minimize the passage of instruments into the uterus, reducing the risk of trauma. It also reduces the risk of cervical lacerations that may be caused by the removal of bony parts from the uterus and the risk of retention of fetal parts in the uterus such as brain matter and tissue.

==Procedure==
As with non-intact D&amp;E, intact D&amp;E may be performed in freestanding clinics, ambulatory surgical centers, and in hospitals. Intra-operative pain control is usually dependent on the setting and patient characteristics but commonly involves local analgesia with either IV sedation or general anesthesia. Preoperative antibiotics are administered to reduce the risk of infection. In cases where the woman is Rh-negative, Rho(D) immunoglobulin (RhoGam) is administered to prevent the risk of developing erythroblastosis fetalis (hemolytic disease of the newborn) in subsequent pregnancies. Intact D&amp;E is more feasible among women with higher parity, at higher gestational ages, and when cervical dilation is greater. There are no absolute contraindications.

=== Cervical preparation ===
The surgery is preceded by cervical preparation, which may take several days. Osmotic dilators, natural or synthetic rods that absorb moisture from the cervix, are placed in the cervix and mechanically dilate the cervix over the course of hours to days. Misoprostol can be used to soften the cervix further. Intact D&amp;E can only be performed with 2–5 centimeters of cervical dilation.

=== Fetal termination ===
Fetal injection of digoxin or potassium chloride may be administered at the beginning of the procedure to allow for softening of the fetal bones or to comply with relevant laws in the physician&#x27;s jurisdiction and the U.S. federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Umbilical cord transection can also be used to induce fetal demise prior to removal.

=== Removal of fetus and placenta ===
During the surgery, the fetus is removed from the uterus in the breech position. If the fetal presentation is not breech, forceps or manual manipulation can be used to turn it to a breech presentation while in the uterus (internal version). The fetal skull is usually the largest part of the fetal body and its removal may require mechanical collapse if it is too large to fit through the cervical canal. Decompression of the skull can be accomplished by incision and suction of the brain or by using forceps to collapse the skull.

== Recovery ==
Recovery from an intact D&amp;E is similar to recovery from a non-intact D&amp;E. Postoperative pain is usually minimal and managed with NSAIDs. In cases of uterine atony and corresponding blood loss, methergine or misoprostol can be given to encourage uterine contraction and achieve hemostasis. Patients who have recently undergone an intact D&amp;E are monitored for signs of coagulopathy, uterine perforation, uterine atony, retained tissue, or hemorrhage.

== Complications ==
The risks of intact D&amp;E are similar to the risks of non-intact D&amp;E and include postoperative infection, hemorrhage, or uterine injury. Overall, the complication rate is low, with rates of serious complications (those requiring blood transfusion, surgery, or hospital treatment) ranging from 0 per 1,000 cases to 2.94 per 1,000 cases. The rate of minor complications is approximately 50 in 1,000 (5%), the same as the minor complication rate for non-intact D&amp;E; the rate of serious complications is higher in non-intact D&amp;E.

Data directly comparing the safety of non-intact to intact D&amp;E are limited. There is no difference in postoperative blood loss or major complications when compared to non-intact D&amp;E. There is no difference in risk of subsequent preterm delivery. The risk of retained tissue is lower since the fetus is removed intact.

In some cases, the physician may not be able to remove the fetus intact due to anatomical limitations. This may present a psychological problem for the patient who wishes to view the remains, or make a comprehensive autopsy impossible, precluding an accurate postmortem diagnosis of fetal anomalies.

==Society and culture==
=== United States politics ===
The term &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; is primarily used in political discourse—chiefly regarding the legality of abortion in the United States. The term is not recognized as a medical term by the American Medical Association nor the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. This term was first suggested in 1995 by Congressman Charles T. Canady, while developing the original proposed Partial-Birth Abortion Ban. According to Keri Folmar, the lawyer responsible for the bill&#x27;s language, the term was developed in early 1995 in a meeting among herself, Charles T. Canady, and National Right to Life Committee lobbyist Douglas Johnson. Canady could not find this particular abortion practice named in any medical textbook, and therefore he and his aides named it. &quot;Partial-birth abortion&quot; was first used in the media on June 4, 1995, in a &quot;Washington Times&quot; article covering the bill.

In the U.S., a federal statute defines &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; as any abortion in which the life of the fetus is terminated after having been extracted from the mother&#x27;s body to a point &quot;past the navel [of the fetus]&quot; or &quot;in the case of head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother&quot; at the time the life is terminated. The U.S. Supreme Court has held that the terms &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; and &quot;intact dilation and extraction&quot; are basically synonymous. However, there are cases where these overlapping terms do not coincide. For example, the intact D&amp;E procedure may be used to remove a deceased fetus (e.g., due to a miscarriage or feticide) that is developed enough to require dilation of the cervix for its extraction. Removing a dead fetus does not meet the federal legal definition of &quot;partial-birth abortion,&quot; which specifies that partial live delivery must precede &quot;the overt act, other than completion of delivery, that kills the partially delivered, living fetus.&quot;

In addition to the federal ban, there have also been a number of state partial-birth abortion bans. There, courts have found that state legislation (rather than federal legislation) intended to ban &quot;partial-birth abortions&quot; could be interpreted to apply to some non-intact dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) procedures. Non-intact D&amp;E, though performed at similar gestational ages, is a fundamentally different procedure.

===Controversy===
Some people believe the D&amp;E procedure illustrates that abortion, and especially late-term abortion, is the taking of a human life and therefore ought to be illegal. People who believe this consider the procedure to be infanticide, a position that many in the anti-abortion movement extend to cover all abortions. Some advocates, both for and against abortion rights, see the intact D&amp;E issue as a central battleground in the wider abortion debate, attempting to set a legal precedent so as to either gradually reduce or gradually increase access to all abortion methods.

Dr. Martin Haskell has called the intact D&amp;E procedure &quot;a quick, surgical outpatient method&quot; for late second-trimester and early third-trimester abortions. The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 describes it as &quot;a gruesome and inhumane procedure that is never medically necessary.&quot;

According to a BBC report about the U.S. Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot;, &quot;government lawyers and others who favour the ban, have said there are alternative and more widely used procedures that are still legal - which involves dismembering the fetus in the uterus.&quot; An article in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; magazine stated that, &quot;Defending the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban... requires arguing to judges that pulling a fetus from a woman&#x27;s body in dismembered pieces is legal, medically acceptable, and safe; but that pulling a fetus out intact, so that if the woman wishes the fetus can be wrapped in a blanket and handed to her, is appropriately punishable by a fine, or up to two years&#x27; imprisonment, or both.&quot; Alternately, opponents of abortion rights frame the issue as one in which a partially-born infant&#x27;s life is disposable, whereas pulling the infant only a few more inches down the birth canal automatically transforms it into &quot;a living person, possessing rights and deserving of protection.&quot; The U.S. Supreme Court has stated that intact D&amp;E remains legal as long as there is first a feticidal injection while the fetus is still completely inside of the mother&#x27;s body.

There is also controversy about why this procedure is used. Although prominent defenders of the method asserted during 1995 and 1996 that it was used only or mostly in acute medical circumstances, lobbyist Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers (a trade association of abortion providers), told &quot;The New York Times&quot; (February 26, 1997): &quot;In the vast majority of cases, the procedure is performed on a healthy mother with a healthy fetus that is 20 weeks or more along.&quot;
Some prominent opponents of abortion rights quickly defended the accuracy of Fitzsimmons&#x27;s statements, whilst others condemned Fitzsimmons as self-serving.

In support of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, a nurse who witnessed three intact D&amp;E procedures found them deeply disturbing, and described one performed on a 26½-week fetus with Down Syndrome in testimony before a Judiciary subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives.

A journalist observed three intact and two non-intact D&amp;E procedures involving fetuses ranging from 19 to 23 weeks. She &quot;watched for any signs of fetal distress, but ... [she] could see no response, no reflexive spasm, nothing. Whether this was a result of the anesthesia or an undeveloped fetal system for pain sensitivity, one thing was clear: There was no discernible response by the fetus.&quot;

Abortion provider Warren Hern asserted in 2003, &quot;No peer-reviewed articles or case reports have ever been published describing anything such as &#x27;partial-birth&#x27; abortion, &#x27;Intact D&amp;E&#x27; (for &#x27;dilation and extraction&#x27;), or any of its synonyms.&quot; Therefore, Hern expressed uncertainty about what all of these terms mean. The U.S. Supreme Court held in &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot; that these terms of the federal statute are not vague because the statute specifically detailed the procedure being banned: it specified anatomical landmarks past which the fetus must not be delivered, and criminalized such a procedure only if an &quot;overt&quot; fatal act is performed on the fetus after &quot;partial delivery.&quot;

===Legality in the United States===
==== Federal law ====
Since 1995, led by Republicans in Congress, the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate have moved several times to pass measures banning the procedure. Congress passed two such measures by wide margins during Bill Clinton&#x27;s presidency, but Clinton vetoed those bills in April 1996 and October 1997 on the grounds that they did not include health exceptions. Subsequent congressional attempts at overriding the veto were unsuccessful.

A major part of the legal battle over banning the procedure relates to health exceptions, which would permit the procedure in special circumstances. The 1973 Supreme Court decision &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, which declared many state-level abortion restrictions unconstitutional, allowed states to ban abortions of post-viable fetuses unless an abortion was &quot;necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.&quot; The companion ruling, &quot;Doe v. Bolton&quot;, upheld against a vagueness challenge a state law that defined health to include mental as well as physical health. The Court has never explicitly held, as a matter of constitutional law, that states have to allow abortions of post-viable fetuses if doing so is necessary for the woman&#x27;s mental health, but many read &quot;Doe&quot; as implying as much. The concern that the health exception can be read so liberally partly explains why supporters of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act did not want to include one.

In 2003, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (H.R. 760, S. 3) was signed into law; the House passed it on October 2 with a vote of 281–142, the Senate passed it on October 21 with a vote of 64–34, and President George W. Bush signed it into law on November 5.

Beginning in early 2004, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the National Abortion Federation, and abortion doctors in Nebraska challenged the ban in federal district courts in the Northern District of California, Southern District of New York, and District of Nebraska. All three district courts ruled the ban unconstitutional that same year. Their respective federal courts of appeals—the Ninth Circuit, Second Circuit, and Eighth Circuit, respectively—affirmed these rulings on appeal.

The three cases were all appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, and were consolidated into the case &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot;. On April 18, 2007, the Supreme Court voted to uphold the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act by a decision of 5–4. Justice Kennedy wrote for the majority and was joined by Justices Thomas, Scalia, Alito, and Chief Justice Roberts. A dissenting opinion was written by Justice Ginsburg and joined by Justices Stevens, Souter and Breyer.

====State law====
Many states have bans on late-term abortions which apply to intact D&amp;E if it is performed after fetal viability.

Many states have also passed bans specifically on intact D&amp;E. The first was Ohio, which in 1995 enacted a law that referred to the procedure as &quot;dilation and extraction&quot;. In 1997, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit found the law unconstitutional on the grounds that it placed a substantial and unconstitutional obstacle in the path of women seeking pre-viability abortions in the second trimester.

Between 1995 and 2000, 28 more states passed Partial-Birth Abortion bans, all similar to the proposed federal bans and all lacking an exemption for the health of the woman. Many of these state laws faced legal challenges, with Nebraska&#x27;s the first to reach decision in &quot;Stenberg v. Carhart&quot;. The Federal District Court held Nebraska&#x27;s statute unconstitutional on two counts. One being the bill&#x27;s language was too broad, potentially rendering a range of abortion procedures illegal, and thus, creating an undue burden on a woman&#x27;s ability to choose. The other count was the bill failed to provide a necessary exception for the health of the woman. The decision was appealed to and affirmed by both the Eighth Circuit and the Supreme Court in June 2000, thus resolving the legal challenges to similar state bans nationwide.

Since the &quot;Stenberg v. Carhart&quot; decision, Virginia, Michigan, and Utah have adopted legislation very similar to the Nebraska law overturned as unconstitutional. The Michigan law was similarly struck down for broadness and failure to provide a health exemption. Utah&#x27;s law remains on the books, pending trial, but is unenforceable under a court-ordered preliminary injunction. Virginia&#x27;s Law was initially ruled invalid, but was reversed and remanded to the District Court in the wake of the &quot;Gonzales v. Carhart&quot; decision, where it was upheld as constitutional. This is despite the fact the Virginia law criminalizes abortions for accidental or intentional intact D&amp;E.

In 2000, Ohio introduced another &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; ban. The law differed from previous attempts at the ban in that it specifically excluded D&amp;E procedures, while also providing a narrow health exception. This law was upheld on appeal to the Sixth Circuit in 2003 on the grounds that &quot;it permitted the partial birth procedure when necessary to prevent significant health risks.&quot;

In 2003, the Michigan Senate introduced Senate Bill No. 395, which would have changed the definition of birth and therefore effectively ban intact D&amp;E. The definition of birth as defined in the bill was that once any part of the body had passed beyond the introitus, it is considered a birth. The bill included an exemption for the mother&#x27;s health. The bill was passed by both the Senate and House of Representatives but was vetoed by governor Jennifer Granholm.

====Clinical response to legal bans on the procedure====
Since the passage of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in the United States and similar state laws, providers of later abortions typically induce and document fetal death before beginning any later abortion procedure. Since the bans only apply to abortions of living fetuses, this protects the abortion providers from prosecution. The most common method of inducing fetal demise is to inject digoxin intrafetally or potassium chloride intrathoracically.
===In other countries===
Questioned about the policy of the UK government on the issue in Parliament, Baroness Andrews stated that:

We are not aware of the procedure referred to as &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot; being used in Great Britain. It is the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists&#x27; (RCOG) belief that this method of abortion is never used as a primary or pro-active technique and is only ever likely to be performed in unforeseen circumstances in order to reduce maternal mortality or severe morbidity.

<text>A plutocracy () or plutarchy is a society that is ruled or controlled by people of great wealth or income. The first known use of the term in English dates from 1631. Unlike most political systems, plutocracy is not rooted in any established political philosophy.

==Usage==
The term &quot;plutocracy&quot; is generally used as a pejorative to describe or warn against an undesirable condition. Throughout history, political thinkers and philosophers have condemned plutocrats for ignoring their social responsibilities, using their power to serve their own purposes and thereby increasing poverty and nurturing class conflict and corrupting societies with greed and hedonism.

&quot;&quot;, an anglicised adaptation of the word &quot;plutocracy&quot;, may refer to &quot;a specifically American version of plutocracy&quot;.

==Examples==
Historic examples of plutocracies include the Roman Empire; some city-states in Ancient Greece; the civilization of Carthage; the Italian merchant city-states of Venice, Florence and Genoa; the Dutch Republic; and the pre-World War II Empire of Japan (the &quot;zaibatsu&quot;). According to Noam Chomsky and Jimmy Carter, the modern United States resembles a plutocracy though with democratic forms. In 2018, Paul Volcker, a former chair of the Federal Reserve, stated he also believed the U.S. to be developing into a plutocracy.

One modern, formal example of a plutocracy, according to some critics, is the City of London. The City (also called the Square Mile of ancient London, corresponding to the modern financial district, an area of about 2.5 km2) has a unique electoral system for its local administration, separate from the rest of London. More than two-thirds of voters are not residents, but rather representatives of businesses and other bodies that occupy premises in the City, with votes distributed according to their numbers of employees. The principal justification for this arrangement is that most of the services provided by the City of London Corporation are used by the businesses in the City. Around 450,000 non-residents constitute the City&#x27;s day-time population, far outnumbering the City&#x27;s 7,000 residents.

In the political jargon and propaganda of Fascist Italy, Nazi Germany and the Communist International, Western democratic states were referred to as plutocracies, with the implication being that a small number of extremely wealthy individuals were controlling the countries and holding them to ransom. Plutocracy replaced democracy and capitalism as the principal fascist term for the U.S. and Great Britain during World War II. In Nazi Germany, it was often used as a dog whistle term for Jewish people in their antisemitic propaganda. Joseph Goebbels, the Reich Minister of Propaganda, found the term to be particularly favorable, describing it as &quot;the main concept at which the ideological struggle will be aimed&quot;.

===United States===

Some modern historians, politicians, and economists argue that the U.S. was effectively plutocratic for at least part of the Gilded Age and Progressive Era periods between the end of the Civil War until the beginning of the Great Depression. President Theodore Roosevelt became known as the &quot;trust-buster&quot; for his aggressive use of antitrust law, through which he managed to break up such major combinations as the largest railroad and Standard Oil, the largest oil company. According to historian David Burton, &quot;When it came to domestic political concerns, TR&#x27;s was the plutocracy.&quot; In his autobiographical account of taking on monopolistic corporations as president, Roosevelt recounted:

The Sherman Antitrust Act had been enacted in 1890, when large industries reaching monopolistic or near-monopolistic levels of market concentration and financial capital increasingly integrating corporations and a handful of very wealthy heads of large corporations began to exert increasing influence over industry, public opinion and politics after the Civil War. Money, according to contemporary progressive and journalist Walter Weyl, was &quot;the mortar of this edifice&quot;, with ideological differences among politicians fading and the political realm becoming &quot;&quot;a mere branch&quot; in a still larger, integrated business. The state, which through the party formally sold favors to the large corporations, became one of their departments.&quot;

In &quot;The Politics of Plutocracy&quot; section of his book, &quot;The Conscience of a Liberal&quot;, economist Paul Krugman says plutocracy took hold because of three factors: at that time, the poorest quarter of American residents (African-Americans and non-naturalized immigrants) were ineligible to vote, the wealthy funded the campaigns of politicians they preferred, and vote buying was &quot;feasible, easy and widespread&quot;, as were other forms of electoral fraud such as ballot-box stuffing and intimidation of the other party&#x27;s voters.

The U.S. instituted progressive taxation in 1913, but according to Shamus Khan, in the 1970s, elites used their increasing political power to lower their taxes, and today successfully employ what political scientist Jeffrey Winters calls &quot;the income defense industry&quot; to greatly reduce their taxes.

In 1998, Bob Herbert of &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to modern American plutocrats as &quot;The Donor Class&quot; (list of top (political party) donors) and defined the class, for the first time, as &quot;a tiny group – just one-quarter of 1 percent of the population – and it is not representative of the rest of the nation. But its money buys plenty of access.&quot;

==== Post-World War II ====
In modern times, the term is sometimes used pejoratively to refer to societies rooted in state-corporate capitalism or which prioritize the accumulation of wealth over other interests. According to Kevin Phillips, author and political strategist to Richard Nixon, the United States is a plutocracy in which there is a &quot;fusion of money and government.&quot;

Chrystia Freeland, author of &quot;Plutocrats&quot;, says that the present trend towards plutocracy occurs because the rich feel that their interests are shared by society:

When the Nobel Prize–winning economist Joseph Stiglitz wrote the 2011 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine article entitled &quot;Of the 1%, by the 1%, for the 1%&quot;, the title and content supported Stiglitz&#x27;s claim that the U.S. is increasingly ruled by the wealthiest 1%. Some researchers have said the U.S. may be drifting towards a form of oligarchy, as individual citizens have less impact than economic elites and organized interest groups upon public policy. In the U.S. Congress itself, more than half of all members are millionaires.

A study conducted by political scientists Martin Gilens of Princeton University and Benjamin Page of Northwestern University, which was released in April 2014, stated that their &quot;analyses suggest that majorities of the American public actually have little influence over the policies our government adopts&quot;. Gilens and Page do not characterize the U.S. as an &quot;oligarchy&quot; or &quot;plutocracy&quot; per se; however, they do apply the concept of &quot;civil oligarchy&quot; as used by Jeffrey A. Winters with respect to the U.S.

The investor, billionaire, and philanthropist Warren Buffett, one of the wealthiest people in the world, voiced in 2005 and once more in 2006 his view that his class, the &quot;rich class&quot;, is waging class warfare on the rest of society. In 2005 Buffet said to CNN: &quot;It&#x27;s class warfare, my class is winning, but they shouldn&#x27;t be.&quot; In a November 2006 interview in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Buffett stated that &quot;[t]here&#x27;s class warfare all right, but it&#x27;s my class, the rich class, that&#x27;s making war, and we&#x27;re winning.&quot;

==Causation==
Reasons why a plutocracy develops are complex. In a nation that is experiencing rapid economic growth, income inequality will tend to increase as the rate of return on innovation increases. In other scenarios, plutocracy may develop when a country is collapsing due to resource depletion as the elites attempt to hoard the diminishing wealth or expand debts to maintain stability, which will tend to enrich creditors and financiers. Economists have also suggested that free market economies tend to drift into monopolies and oligopolies because of the greater efficiency of larger businesses (see economies of scale).

Other nations may become plutocratic through kleptocracy or rent-seeking.

<text>The Pareto principle (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few and the principle of factor sparsity) states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the &quot;vital few&quot;).

In 1941, management consultant Joseph M. Juran developed the concept in the context of quality control and improvement after reading the works of Italian sociologist and economist Vilfredo Pareto, who wrote in 1906 about the 80/20 connection while teaching at the University of Lausanne. In his first work, &quot;Cours d&#x27;économie politique&quot;, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in the Kingdom of Italy was owned by 20% of the population. The Pareto principle is only tangentially related to the Pareto efficiency.

Mathematically, the 80/20 rule is roughly described by a power law distribution (also known as a Pareto distribution) for a particular set of parameters. Many natural phenomena are distributed according to power law statistics. It is an adage of business management that &quot;80% of sales come from 20% of clients.&quot;

== History ==

In 1941, Joseph M. Juran, a Romanian-born American engineer, came across the work of Italian polymath Vilfredo Pareto. Pareto noted that approximately 80% of Italy&#x27;s land was owned by 20% of the population. Juran applied the observation that 80% of an issue is caused by 20% of the causes to quality issues. Later during his career, Juran preferred to describe this as &quot;the vital few and the useful many&quot; to highlight that the contribution of the remaining 80% should not be discarded entirely.

== Mathematical explanation ==
The demonstration of the Pareto principle is explained by a large proportion of process variation being associated with a small proportion of process variables. This is a special case of the wider phenomenon of Pareto distributions. If the Pareto index α, which is one of the parameters characterizing a Pareto distribution, is chosen as α = log45 ≈ 1.16, then one has 80% of effects coming from 20% of causes.

The term 80/20 is only a shorthand for the general principle at work. In individual cases, the distribution could be nearer to 90/5 or 70/40. Note that there is no need for the two numbers to add up to the number 100, as they are measures of different things. The Pareto principle is an illustration of a &quot;power law&quot; relationship, which also occurs in phenomena such as bush fires and earthquakes. Because it is self-similar over a wide range of magnitudes, it produces outcomes completely different from Normal or Gaussian distribution phenomena. This fact explains the frequent breakdowns of sophisticated financial instruments, which are modeled on the assumption that a Gaussian relationship is appropriate to something like stock price movements.

=== Gini coefficient and Hoover index ===

Using the &quot;&quot;A&quot;:&quot;B&quot;&quot; notation (for example, 0.8:0.2) and with &quot;A&quot; + &quot;B&quot; = 1, inequality measures like the Gini index (G) &quot;and&quot; the Hoover index (H) can be computed. In this case both are the same:

: formula_1

: formula_2

== Analysis ==
Pareto analysis is a formal technique useful where many possible courses of action are competing for attention. In essence, the problem-solver estimates the benefit delivered by each action, then selects a number of the most effective actions that deliver a total benefit reasonably close to the maximal possible one.

Pareto analysis is a creative way of looking at causes of problems because it helps stimulate thinking and organize thoughts. However, it can be limited by its exclusion of possibly important problems which may be small initially, but will grow with time. It should be combined with other analytical tools such as failure mode and effects analysis and fault tree analysis for example.

This technique helps to identify the top portion of causes that need to be addressed to resolve the majority of problems. Once the predominant causes are identified, then tools like the Ishikawa diagram or Fish-bone Analysis can be used to identify the root causes of the problems. While it is common to refer to pareto as &quot;80/20&quot; rule, under the assumption that, in all situations, 20% of causes determine 80% of problems, this ratio is merely a convenient rule of thumb and is not, nor should it be considered, an immutable law of nature.

The application of the Pareto analysis in risk management allows management to focus on those risks that have the most impact on the project.

Steps to identify the important causes using 80/20 rule:

# Form a frequency of occurrences as a percentage
# Arrange the rows in decreasing order of importance of the causes (i.e., the most important cause first)
# Add a cumulative percentage column to the table, then plot the information
# Plot (#1) a curve with causes on &quot;x&quot;- and cumulative percentage on &quot;y&quot;-axis
# Plot (#2) a bar graph with causes on &quot;x&quot;- and percent frequency on &quot;y&quot;-axis
# Draw a horizontal dotted line at 80% from the &quot;y&quot;-axis to intersect the curve. Then draw a vertical dotted line from the point of intersection to the &quot;x&quot;-axis. The vertical dotted line separates the important causes (on the left) and trivial causes (on the right)
# Explicitly review the chart to ensure that causes for at least 80% of the problems are captured

== Applications ==

=== Economics ===

Pareto&#x27;s observation was in connection with population and wealth. Pareto noticed that approximately 80% of Italy&#x27;s land was owned by 20% of the population. He then carried out surveys on a variety of other countries and found to his surprise that a similar distribution applied.

A chart that demonstrated the effect appeared in the 1992 United Nations Development Program Report, which showed that the richest 20% of the world&#x27;s population receives 82.7% of the world&#x27;s income. However, among nations, the Gini index shows that wealth distributions vary substantially around this norm.

The principle also holds within the tails of the distribution. The physicist Victor Yakovenko of the University of Maryland, College Park and AC Silva analyzed income data from the US Internal Revenue Service from 1983 to 2001 and found that the income distribution of the richest 1–3% of the population also follows Pareto&#x27;s principle.

In &quot;Talent: How to Identify Entrepreneurs&quot;, economist Tyler Cowen and entrepreneur Daniel Gross suggest that the Pareto Principle can be applied to the role of the 20% most talented individuals in generating the majority of economic growth. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 1988, many video rental shops reported that 80% of revenue came from 20% of videotapes (although rarely rented classics such as &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; must be stocked to appear to have a good selection).

=== Computing ===

In computer science the Pareto principle can be applied to optimization efforts. For example, Microsoft noted that by fixing the top 20% of the most-reported bugs, 80% of the related errors and crashes in a given system would be eliminated. Lowell Arthur expressed that &quot;20% of the code has 80% of the errors. Find them, fix them!&quot;

=== Occupational health and safety ===

Occupational health and safety professionals use the Pareto principle to underline the importance of hazard prioritization. Assuming 20% of the hazards account for 80% of the injuries, and by categorizing hazards, safety professionals can target those 20% of the hazards that cause 80% of the injuries or accidents. Alternatively, if hazards are addressed in random order, a safety professional is more likely to fix one of the 80% of hazards that account only for some fraction of the remaining 20% of injuries.

Aside from ensuring efficient accident prevention practices, the Pareto principle also ensures hazards are addressed in an economical order, because the technique ensures the utilized resources are best used to prevent the most accidents.

=== Engineering and quality control ===

The Pareto principle is the basis for the Pareto chart, one of the key tools used in total quality control and Six Sigma techniques. The Pareto principle serves as a baseline for ABC-analysis and XYZ-analysis, widely used in logistics and procurement for the purpose of optimizing stock of goods, as well as costs of keeping and replenishing that stock. In engineering control theory, such as for electromechanical energy converters, the 80/20 principle applies to optimization efforts.

The remarkable success of statistically based searches for root causes is based upon a combination of an empirical principle and mathematical logic. The empirical principle is usually known as the Pareto principle. With regard to variation causality, this principle states that there is a non-random distribution of the slopes of the numerous (theoretically infinite) terms in the general equation.

All of the terms are independent of each other by definition. Interdependent factors appear as multiplication terms. The Pareto principle states that the effect of the dominant term is very much greater than the second-largest effect term, which in turn is very much greater than the third, and so on. There is no explanation for this phenomenon; that is why we refer to it as an empirical principle.

The mathematical logic is known as the square-root-of-the-sum-of-the-squares axiom. This states that the variation caused by the steepest slope must be squared, and then the result added to the square of the variation caused by the second-steepest slope, and so on. The total observed variation is then the square root of the total sum of the variation caused by individual slopes squared. This derives from the probability density function for multiple variables or the multivariate distribution (we are treating each term as an independent variable).

The combination of the Pareto principle and the square-root-of-the-sum-of-the-squares axiom means that the strongest term in the general equation totally dominates the observed variation of effect. Thus, the strongest term will dominate the data collected for hypothesis testing.

In the systems science discipline, Joshua M. Epstein and Robert Axtell created an agent-based simulation model called Sugarscape, from a decentralized modeling approach, based on individual behavior rules defined for each agent in the economy. Wealth distribution and Pareto&#x27;s 80/20 principle emerged in their results, which suggests the principle is a collective consequence of these individual rules.

=== Health and social outcomes ===

In 2009, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality said 20% of patients incurred 80% of healthcare expenses due to chronic conditions. A 2021 analysis showed unequal distribution of healthcare costs, with older patients and those with poorer health incurring more costs.
The 80/20 rule has been proposed as a rule of thumb for the infection distribution in superspreading events. However, the degree of infectiousness has been found to be distributed continuously in the population. In epidemics with super-spreading, the majority of individuals infect relatively few secondary contacts.

<doc id="24564" wikidata="Q134830" url="?curid=24564" title="Prefix">
<text>A prefix is an affix which is placed before the stem of a word. Particularly in the study of languages, a prefix is also called a preformative, because it alters the form of the word to which it is affixed.

Prefixes, like other affixes, can be either inflectional, creating a new form of a word with the same basic meaning and same lexical category, or derivational, creating a new word with a new semantic meaning and sometimes also a different lexical category. Prefixes, like all affixes, are usually bound morphemes.

English has no inflectional prefixes, using only suffixes for that purpose. Adding a prefix to the beginning of an English word changes it to a different word. For example, when the prefix &quot;un-&quot; is added to the word &quot;happy&quot;, it creates the word &quot;unhappy&quot;. 

The word &quot;prefix&quot; is itself made up of the stem &quot;fix&quot; (meaning &quot;attach&quot;, in this case), and the prefix &quot;pre-&quot; (meaning &quot;before&quot;), both of which are derived from Latin roots.

This is a fairly comprehensive, although not exhaustive, list of derivational prefixes in English. Depending on precisely how one defines a derivational prefix, some of the neoclassical combining forms may or may not qualify for inclusion in such a list. This list takes the broad view that &quot;acro-&quot; and &quot;auto-&quot; count as English derivational prefixes because they function the same way like that of prefixes such as &quot;over-&quot; and &quot;self-&quot; do.

As for numeral prefixes, only the most common members of that class are included here. There is a large separate table covering them all at Numeral prefix &gt; Table of number prefixes in English.

===Hyphenation===
The choice between hyphenation or solid styling for prefixes in English is covered at Hyphen &gt; Prefixes and suffixes.

==Japanese language==
Commonly used prefixes in Japanese include and . They are used as part of the honorific system of speech, and are used as markers for politeness, showing respect for the person or thing they are affixed to, notably also being used euphemistically.

==Bantu languages==
In the Bantu languages of Africa, which are agglutinating, the noun class is conveyed through prefixes, which is declined and agrees with all of its arguments accordingly.

===Example from Luganda===


==Navajo==
Verbs in the Navajo language are formed from a word stem and multiple affixes. For example, each verb requires one of four non-syllabic prefixes (∅, ł, d, l) to create a verb theme.

==Sunwar==
In the Sunwar language of Eastern Nepal, the prefix ma- म is used to create negative verbs. It is the only verbal prefix in the language.

==Russian==
As a part of the formation of nouns, prefixes are less common in Russian than suffixes, but alter the meaning of a word.

==German==
In German, derivatives formed with prefixes may be classified in two categories: those used with substantives and adjectives, and those used with verbs. For derivative substantives and adjectives, only two productive prefixes are generally addable to any substantive or adjective as of 1970: &quot;un-&quot;, which expresses negation (as in &quot;ungesund&quot;, from &quot;gesund&quot;), and &quot;ur-&quot;, which means &quot;original, primitive&quot; in substantives, and has an emphatic function in adjectives. &quot;ge-&quot;, on the other hand, expresses union or togetherness, but only in a closed group of words—it cannot simply be added to any noun or adjective.

Verbal prefixes commonly in use are &quot;be-&quot;, &quot;ent-&quot;, &quot;er-&quot;, &quot;ge-&quot;, &quot;miss-&quot;, &quot;ver-&quot;, and &quot;zer-&quot; (see also Separable verb). &quot;be-&quot; expresses strengthening or generalization. &quot;ent-&quot; expresses negation. &quot;ge-&quot; indicates the completion of an action, which is why its most common use has become the forming of the past participle of verbs; &quot;ver-&quot; has an emphatic function, or it is used to turn a substantive or an adjective into a verb. In some cases, the prefix particle &quot;ent-&quot; (negation) can be considered the opposite of particle &quot;be-&quot;, while &quot;er-&quot; can be considered the opposite of &quot;ver-&quot;.

The prefix &quot;er-&quot; usually indicates the successful completion of an action, and sometimes the conclusion means death. With fewer verbs, it indicates the beginning of an action. The prefix &quot;er-&quot; is also used to form verbs from adjectives (e.g. &quot;erkalten&quot; is equivalent to &quot;kalt werden&quot; which means &quot;to get cold&quot;).

<text>Pope Anterus (, , was the bishop of Rome from 21 November 235 until his death on 3 January 236.

==Life==
Anterus was the son of Romulus, born in Petilia Policastro, Calabria, Italy. He is thought to have been of Greek origin, and his name may indicate that he was a freed slave. He succeeded Pope Pontian, who had been deported from Rome to Sardinia, along with the antipope Hippolytus. He created one bishop, for the city of Fondi.

Some scholars believe Anterus was martyred, because he ordered greater strictness in searching into the acts of the martyrs, exactly collected by the notaries appointed by Pope Clement I. Other scholars doubt this and believe it is more likely that he died in undramatic circumstances during the persecutions of Emperor Maximinus the Thracian.

He was buried in the papal crypt of the Catacomb of Callixtus, on the Appian Way in Rome. The site of his sepulchre was discovered by Giovanni Battista de Rossi in 1854, with some broken remnants of the Greek epitaph engraved on the narrow oblong slab that closed his tomb; only the Greek term for bishop was legible. His ashes had been removed to the Church of Saint Sylvester in the Campus Martius and were discovered on 17 November 1595, when Pope Clement VIII rebuilt that church.

Pope Anterus is remembered in the Catholic Church on 3 January and in the Russian Orthodox Church on 18 August.

<doc id="24566" wikidata="Q179957" url="?curid=24566" title="Palaeography">
<text>Palaeography (UK) or paleography (US) (ultimately from , , &#x27;old&#x27;, and , , &#x27;to write&#x27;) is the study and academic discipline of historical writing systems. It encompasses the historicity of manuscripts and texts, subsuming deciphering and dating of historical manuscripts, as well as the analysis of historic penmanship, handwriting script, signification and printed media. It is primarily concerned with the forms, processes and relationships of writing and printing systems as evident in a text, document or manuscript; and analysis of the substantive textual content of documents is a secondary function. Included in the discipline is the practice of deciphering, reading, and dating manuscripts, and the cultural context of writing, including the methods with which texts such as manuscripts, books, codices, tracts, and monographs were produced, and the history of scriptoria. This discipline is important for understanding, authenticating, and dating historical texts. However, in the absence of additional evidence, it cannot be used to pinpoint exact dates.

The discipline is one of the auxiliary sciences of history, and is considered to have been founded by Jean Mabillon with his 1681 work &quot;&quot;, the first textbook to address the subject. The term &quot;palaeography&quot; was coined by Bernard de Montfaucon with the publication of his work on Greek palaeography, the &quot;Palaeographia Graeca,&quot; in 1708.

== Application ==
Palaeography is an essential skill for many historians, semioticians and philologists, as it addresses a suite of interrelated lines of inquiry. First, since the style of an alphabet, grapheme or sign system set within a register in each given dialect and language has evolved constantly, it is necessary to know how to decipher its individual substantive, occurrence make-up and constituency. For example, assessing its characters and typology as they existed in various places, times and locations. In addition, for hand-written texts, scribes often use many abbreviations, and annotations so as to functionally aid speed, efficiency and ease of writing and in some registers to importantly save invaluable space of the medium. Hence, the specialist-palaeographer, philologist and semiotician must know how to, in the broadest sense, interpret, comprehend and understand them. Knowledge of individual letterforms, typographic ligatures, signs, typology, fonts, graphemes, hieroglyphics, and signification forms in general, subsuming punctuation, syntagm and proxemics, abbreviations and annotations; enables the palaeographer to read, comprehend and then to understand the text and/or the relationship and hierarchy between texts in suite. The palaeographer, philologist and semiotician must first determine language, then dialect and then the register, function and purpose of the text. That is, one must by necessity become expert in the formation, historicity and evolution of these languages and signification communities, and material communication events. Secondly, the historical usages of various styles of handwriting, common writing customs, and scribal or notarial abbreviations, annotations conventions, annexures, addenda and specifics of printed typology, syntagm and proxemics must be assessed as a collective undertaking. Philological knowledge of the register, language, vocabulary, and grammar generally used at a given time, place and circumstance may assist palaeographers to identify a hierarchy of texts in a suite through discourse analysis, determining the provenance of texts, identifying forgeries, interpolations and recensions with precision; eliciting a professional authenticity in documentation, textual and manuscript evaluation with view to producing a critical edition if required and a critical assessment of a given discourse event as rendered and set in a materiality or medium.

Knowledge of writing materials and discourse material production systems is foundational to the study of handwriting and printing events and to the identification of the periods in which a document or manuscript may have been produced. An important goal may be to assign the text a date and a place of origin, or determining which translations of a text are produced from which specific document or manuscript. This is why the palaeographer and attendant semiologists and philologists must take into account the style, substance and formation of the text, document and manuscript and the handwriting style and printed typology, grapheme typos and lexical and signification system(s) employed.

=== Document dating ===
Palaeography may be employed to provide information about the date at which a document was written. However, &quot;paleography is a last resort for dating&quot; and, &quot;for book hands, a period of 50 years is the least acceptable spread of time&quot; with it being suggested that &quot;the &#x27;rule of thumb&#x27; should probably be to avoid dating a hand more precisely than a range of at least seventy or eighty years&quot;. In a 2005 e-mail addendum to his 1996 &quot;The Paleographical Dating of P-46&quot; paper Bruce W. Griffin stated &quot;Until more rigorous methodologies are developed, it is difficult to construct a 95% confidence interval for [New Testament] manuscripts without allowing a century for an assigned date.&quot; William Schniedewind went even further in the abstract to his 2005 paper &quot;Problems of Paleographic Dating of Inscriptions&quot; and stated: &quot;The so-called science of paleography often relies on circular reasoning because there is insufficient data to draw precise conclusion about dating. Scholars also tend to oversimplify diachronic development, assuming models of simplicity rather than complexity&quot;.

== Ancient Near East ==


== Aramaic palaeography ==

The Aramaic language was the international trade language of the Ancient Middle East, originating in what is modern-day Syria, between 1000 and 600 BC. It spread from the Mediterranean coast to the borders of India, becoming extremely popular and being adopted by many people, both with or without any previous writing system. The Aramaic script was written in a consonantal form with a direction from right to left. The Aramaic alphabet, a modified form of Phoenician, was the ancestor of the modern Arabic and Hebrew scripts, as well as the Brahmi script, the parent writing system of most modern abugidas in India, Southeast Asia, Tibet, and Mongolia. Initially, the Aramaic script did not differ from the Phoenician, but then the Aramaeans simplified some of the letters, thickened and rounded their lines: a specific feature of its letters is the distinction between and . One innovation in Aramaic is the system to indicate certain vowels. Early Phoenician-derived scripts did not have letters for vowels, and so most texts recorded just consonants. Most likely as a consequence of phonetic changes in North Semitic languages, the Aramaeans reused certain letters in the alphabet to represent long vowels. The letter &quot;aleph&quot; was employed to write /ā/, &quot;he&quot; for /ō/, &quot;yod&quot; for /ī/, and &quot;vav&quot; for /ū/.

Aramaic writing and language supplanted Babylonian cuneiform and Akkadian language, even in their homeland in Mesopotamia. The wide diffusion of Aramaic letters led to its writing being used not only in monumental inscriptions, but also on papyrus and potsherds. Aramaic papyri have been found in large numbers in Egypt, especially at Elephantine—among them are official and private documents of the Jewish military settlement in 5 BC. In the Aramaic papyri and potsherds, words are separated usually by a small gap, as in modern writing. At the turn of the 3rd to 2nd centuries BC, the heretofore uniform Aramaic letters developed new forms, as a result of dialectal and political fragmentation in several subgroups. The most important of these is the so-called square Hebrew block script, followed by Palmyrene, Nabataean, and the much later Syriac script.

Aramaic is usually divided into three main parts:
# Old Aramaic (in turn subdivided into Ancient, Imperial, Old Eastern and Old Western Aramaic)
# Middle Aramaic, and
# Modern Aramaic of the present day.

The term Middle Aramaic refers to the form of Aramaic which appears in pointed texts and is reached in the 3rd century AD with the loss of short unstressed vowels in open syllables, and continues until the triumph of Arabic.

Old Aramaic appeared in the 11th century BC as the official language of the first Aramaean states. The oldest witnesses to it are inscriptions from northern Syria of the 10th to 8th centuries BC, especially extensive state treaties () and royal inscriptions. The early Old Ancient should be classified as &quot;Ancient Aramaic&quot; and consists of two clearly distinguished and standardised written languages, the Early Ancient Aramaic and the Late Ancient Aramaic. Aramaic was influenced at first principally by Akkadian, then from the 5th century BC by Persian and from the 3rd century BC onwards by Greek, as well as by Hebrew, especially in Palestine. As Aramaic evolved into the imperial language of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the script used to write it underwent a change into something more cursive. The best examples of this script come from documents written on papyrus from Egypt. About 500 BC, Darius I (522–486) made the Aramaic used by the imperial administration into the official language of the western half of the Achaemenid Empire. This so-called &quot;Imperial Aramaic&quot; (the oldest dated example, from Egypt, belonging to 495 BC) is based on an otherwise unknown written form of Ancient Aramaic from Babylonia. In orthography, Imperial Aramaic preserves historical forms—alphabet, orthography, morphology, pronunciation, vocabulary, syntax and style are highly standardised. Only the formularies of the private documents and the Proverbs of Ahiqar have maintained an older tradition of sentence structure and style. Imperial Aramaic immediately replaced Ancient Aramaic as a written language and, with slight modifications, it remained the official, commercial and literary language of the Near East until gradually, beginning with the fall of the Achaemenids in 331 BC and ending in the 4th century AD, it was replaced by Greek, Persian, the eastern and western dialects of Aramaic and Arabic, though not without leaving its traces in the written form of most of these. In its original Achaemenid form, Imperial Aramaic is found in texts of the 5th to 3rd centuries BC. These come mostly from Egypt and especially from the Jewish military colony of Elephantine, which existed at least from 530 to 399 BC.

== Greek palaeography ==

A history of Greek handwriting must be incomplete owing to the fragmentary nature of evidence. If one rules out the inscriptions on stone or metal, which belong to the science of epigraphy, there is practically a dependence on papyri from Egypt for the period preceding the 4th or 5th century AD, the earliest of which take back our knowledge only to the end of the 4th century BC. This limitation is less serious than might appear, since the few manuscripts not of Egyptian origin which have survived from this period, like the parchments from Avroman or Dura-Europos, the Herculaneum papyri, and a few documents found in Egypt but written elsewhere, reveal a uniformity of style in the various portions of the Greek world; however, differences can be discerned, with it being probable that distinct local styles could be traced were there more material to analyze.

Further, during any given period several types of hand may exist together. There was a marked difference between the hand used for literary works (generally called &quot;uncials&quot; but, in the papyrus period, better styled &quot;book-hand&quot;) and that of documents (&quot;cursive&quot;) and within each of these classes several distinct styles were employed side by side; and the various types are not equally well represented in the surviving papyri.

The development of any hand is largely influenced by the materials used. To this general rule the Greek script is no exception. Whatever may have been the period at which the use of papyrus or leather as a writing material began in Greece (and papyrus was employed in the 5th century BC), it is highly probable that for some time after the introduction of the alphabet the characters were incised with a sharp tool on stones or metal far oftener than they were written with a pen. In cutting a hard surface, it is easier to form angles than curves; in writing the reverse is the case; hence the development of writing was from angular letters (&quot;capitals&quot;) inherited from epigraphic style to rounded ones (&quot;uncials&quot;). But only certain letters were affected by this development, in particular (uncial ), (), (), and to a lesser extent ().

=== Ptolemaic period ===
The earliest Greek papyrus yet discovered is probably that containing the &quot;Persae&quot; of Timotheus, which dates from the second half of the 4th century BC and its script has a curiously archaic appearance. , , and have the capital form, and apart from these test letters the general effect is one of stiffness and angularity. More striking is the hand of the earliest dated papyrus, a contract of 311 BC. Written with more ease and elegance, it shows little trace of any development towards a truly cursive style; the letters are not linked, and though the uncial is used throughout, and have the capital forms. A similar impression is made by the few other papyri, chiefly literary, dating from about 300 BC; may be slightly rounded, approach the uncial form, and the angular occurs as a letter only in the Timotheus papyrus, though it survived longer as a numeral (= 200), but the hands hardly suggest that for at least a century and a half the art of writing on papyrus had been well established. Yet before the middle of the 3rd century BC, one finds both a practised book-hand and a developed and often remarkably handsome cursive.

These facts may be due to accident, the few early papyri happening to represent an archaic style which had survived along with a more advanced one; but it is likely that there was a rapid development at this period, due partly to the opening of Egypt, with its supplies of papyri, and still more to the establishment of the great Alexandrian Library, which systematically copied literary and scientific works, and to the multifarious activities of Hellenistic bureaucracy. From here onward, the two types of script were sufficiently distinct (though each influenced the other) to require separate treatment. Some literary papyri, like the roll containing Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Constitution of Athens&quot;, were written in cursive hands, and, conversely, the book-hand was occasionally used for documents. Since the scribe did not date literary rolls, such papyri are useful in tracing the development of the book-hand.

The documents of the mid-3rd century BC show a great variety of cursive hands. There are none from chancelleries of the Hellenistic monarchs, but some letters, notably those of Apollonius, the finance minister of Ptolemy II, to this agent, Zeno, and those of the Palestinian sheikh, Toubias, are in a type of script which cannot be very unlike the Chancery hand of the time, and show the Ptolemaic cursive at its best. These hands have a noble spaciousness and strength, and though the individual letters are by no means uniform in size there is a real unity of style, the general impression being one of breadth and uprightness. , with the cross-stroke high, , , with the middle stroke reduced to a very shallow curve, sometimes approaching a horizontal line, , and , with its cross-bar extending much further to the left than to the right of the up-stroke, and , whose last stroke is prolonged upwards above the line, often curving backwards, are all broad; , , and , which sometimes takes the form of two almost perpendicular strokes joined only at the top, are usually small; is rather flat, its second loop reduced to a practically straight line. Partly by the broad flat tops of the larger letters, partly by the insertion of a stroke connecting those (like H, Υ) which are not naturally adapted to linking, the scribes produced the effect of a horizontal line along the top of the writing, from which the letters seem to hang. This feature is indeed a general characteristic of the more formal Ptolemaic script, but it is specially marked in the 3rd century BC.

Besides these hand of Chancery type, there are numerous less elaborate examples of cursive, varying according to the writer&#x27;s skill and degree of education, and many of them strikingly easy and handsome. In some cursiveness is carried very far, the linking of letters reaching the point of illegibility, and the characters sloping to the right. is reduced to a mere acute angle (), has the cross-stroke only on the left, becomes an almost straight line, acquires a shape somewhat like h, and the last stroke of is extended far upwards and at times flattened out until it is little more than a diagonal stroke to the right. The attempt to secure a horizontal line along the top is here abandoned. This style was not due to inexpertness, but to the desire for speed, being used especially in accounts and drafts, and was generally the work of practised writers. How well established the cursive hand had now become is shown in some wax tablets of this period, the writing on which, despite the difference of material, closely resemble the hands of papyri.

Documents of the late 3rd and early 2nd centuries BC show there is nothing analogous to the Apollonius letters, perhaps partly by the accident of survival. In the more formal types the letters stand rather stiffly upright, often without the linking strokes, and are more uniform in size; in the more cursive they are apt to be packed closely together. These features are more marked in the hands of the 2nd century. The less cursive often show am approximation to the book-hand, the letters growing rounder and less angular than in the 3rd century; in the more cursive linking was carried further, both by the insertion of coupling strokes and by the writing of several letters continuously without raising the pen, so that before the end of the century an almost current hand was evolved. A characteristic letter, which survived into the early Roman period, is , with its cross-stroke made in two portions (variants:). In the 1st century, the hand tended, so far as can be inferred from surviving examples, to disintegrate; one can recognise the signs which portend a change of style, irregularity, want of direction, and the loss of the feeling for style. A fortunate accident has preserved two Greek parchments written in Parthia, one dated 88 BC, in a practically unligatured hand, the other, 22/21 BC, in a very cursive script of Ptolemaic type; and though each has non-Egyptian features the general character indicates a uniformity of style in the Hellenistic world.

The development of the Ptolemaic book-hand is difficult to trace, as there are few examples, mostly not datable on external grounds. Only for the 3rd century BC have we a secure basis. The hands of that period have an angular appearance; there is little uniformity in the size of individual letters, and though sometimes, notably in the Petrie papyrus containing the &quot;Phaedo&quot; of Plato, a style of considerable delicacy is attained, the book-hand in general shows less mastery than the contemporary cursive. In the 2nd century, the letters grew rounder and more uniform in size, but in the 1st century there is a certain disintegration perceptible, as in the cursive hand. Probably at no time did the Ptolemaic book-hand acquire such unity of stylistic effect as the cursive.

=== Roman period ===
Papyri of the Roman period are far more numerous and show greater variety. The cursive of the 1st century has a rather broken appearance, part of one character being often made separately from the rest and linked to the next letter. A form characteristic of the 1st and 2nd century and surviving after that only as a fraction sign () is in the shape . By the end of the 1st century, there had been developed several excellent types of cursive, which, though differing considerably both in the forms of individual letters and in general appearance, bear a family likeness to one another. Qualities which are specially noticeable are roundness in the shape of letters, continuity of formation, the pen being carried on from character to character, and regularity, the letters not differing strikingly in size and projecting strokes above or below the line being avoided. Sometimes, especially in tax-receipts and in stereotyped formulae, cursiveness is carried to an extreme. In a letter of the prefect, dated in 209, we have a fine example of the Chancery hand, with tall and laterally compressed letters, very narrow and and often written high in the line. This style, from at least the latter part of the 2nd century, exercised considerable influence on the local hands, many of which show the same characteristics less pronounced; and its effects may be traced into the early part of the 4th century. Hands of the 3rd century uninfluenced by it show a falling off from the perfection of the 2nd century; stylistic uncertainty and a growing coarseness of execution mark a period of decline and transition.

Several different types of book-hand were used in the Roman period. Particularly handsome is a round, upright hand seen, for example, in a British Museum papyrus containing &quot;Odyssey&quot; III. The cross-stroke of is high, deeply curved and has the form . Uniformity of size is well attained, and a few strokes project, and these but slightly, above or below the line. Another type, well called by palaeographer Schubart the &quot;severe&quot; style, has a more angular appearance and not infrequently slopes to the right; though handsome, it has not the sumptuous appearance of the former. There are various classes of a less pretentious style, in which convenience rather than beauty was the first consideration and no pains were taken to avoid irregularities in the shape and alignment of the letters. Lastly may be mentioned a hand which is of great interest as being the ancestor of the type called (from its later occurrence in vellum codices of the Bible) the biblical hand. This, which can be traced back at least the late 2nd century, has a square, rather heavy appearance; the letters, of uniform size, stand upright, and thick and thin strokes are well distinguished. In the 3rd century the book-hand, like the cursive, appears to have deteriorated in regularity and stylistic accomplishment.

In the charred rolls found at Herculaneum are specimens of Greek literary hands from outside Egypt dating to . A comparison with the Egyptian papyri reveals great similarity in style and shows that conclusions drawn from the henads of Egypt may, with caution, be applied to the development of writing in the Greek world generally.

=== Byzantine period ===
The cursive hand of the 4th century shows some uncertainty of character. Side by side with the style founded on the Chancery hand, regular in formation and with tall and narrow letters, which characterised the period of Diocletian, and lasted well into the century, we find many other types mostly marked by a certain looseness and irregularity. A general progress towards a florid and sprawling hand is easily recognisable, but a consistent and deliberate style was hardly evolved before the 5th century, from which unfortunately few dated documents have survived. Byzantine cursive tends to an exuberant hand, in which the long strokes are excessively extended and individual letters often much enlarged. But not a few hands of the 5th and 6th centuries are truly handsome and show considerable technical accomplishment. Both an upright and a sloping type occur and there are many less ornamental hands, but there gradually emerged towards the 7th century two general types, one (especially used in letters and contracts) a current hand, sloping to the right, with long strokes in such characters at , , , (which has the h shape), , and , and with much linking of letters, and another (frequent in accounts), which shows, at least in essence, most of the forms of the later minuscule. (cf. below.) This is often upright, though a slope to the right is quite common, and sometimes, especially in one or two documents of the early Arabic period, it has an almost calligraphic effect.

In the Byzantine period, the book-hand, which in earlier times had more than once approximated to the contemporary cursive, diverged widely from it.

=== Vellum and paper manuscripts ===
The change from papyrus to vellum involved no such modification in the forms of letters as followed that from metal to papyrus. The justification for considering the two materials separately is that after the general adoption of vellum, the Egyptian evidence is first supplemented and later superseded by that of manuscripts from elsewhere, and that during this period the hand most used was one not previously employed for literary purposes.

==== Uncial hand ====

The prevailing type of book-hand during what in papyrology is called the Byzantine period, that is, roughly from AD 300 to 650, is known as the biblical hand. It went back to at least the end of the 2nd century and had had originally no special connection with Christian literature. In both vellum and paper manuscripts from 4th-century Egypt are other forms of script, particularly a sloping, rather inelegant hand derived from the literary hand of the 3rd century, which persisted until at least the 5th century. The three great early codices of the Bible are all written in uncials of the biblical type. In the &quot;Vaticanus&quot;, placed during the 4th century, the characteristics of the hand are least strongly marked; the letters have the forms characteristic of the type but without the heavy appearance of later manuscripts, and the general impression is one of greater roundness. In the &quot;Sinaiticus&quot;, which is not much later, the letters are larger and more heavily made; in the 5th-century &quot;Alexandrinus&quot;, a later development is seen with emphatic distinction of thick and thin strokes. By the 6th century, alike in vellum and in papyrus manuscripts, the heaviness had become very marked, though the hand still retained, in its best examples, a handsome appearance; but after this it steadily deteriorated, becoming ever more mechanical and artificial. The thick strokes grew heavier; the cross strokes of and and the base of were furnished with drooping spurs. The hand, which is often singularly ugly, passed through various modifications, now sloping, now upright, though it is not certain that these variations were really successive rather than concurrent. A different type of uncials, derived from the Chancery hand and seen in two papyrus examples of the Festal letters despatched annually by the Patriarch of Alexandria, was occasionally used, the best known example being the &quot;Codex Marchalianus&quot; (6th or 7th century). A combination of this hand with the other type is also known.

==== Minuscule hand ====
The uncial hand lingered on, mainly for liturgical manuscripts, where a large and easily legible script was serviceable, as late as the 12th century, but in ordinary use it had long been superseded by a new type of hand, the minuscule, which originated in the 8th century, as an adaptation to literary purposes of the second of the types of Byzantine cursive mentioned above. A first attempt at a calligraphic use of this hand, seen in one or two manuscripts of the 8th or early 9th century, in which it slopes to the right and has a narrow, angular appearance, did not find favour, but by the end of the 9th century a more ornamental type, from which modern Greek script descended, was already established. It has been suggested that it was evolved in the Monastery of Stoudios at Constantinople. In its earliest examples it is upright and exact but lacks flexibility; accents are small, breathings square in formation, and in general only such ligatures are used as involve no change in the shape of letters. The single forms have a general resemblance (with considerable differences in detail) both to the minuscule cursive of late papyri, and to those used in modern Greek type; uncial forms were avoided.

In the course of the 10th century the hand, without losing its beauty and exactness, gained in freedom. Its finest period was from the 9th to the 12th century, after which it rapidly declined. The development was marked by a tendency
# to the intrusion, in growing quantity, of uncial forms which good scribes could fit into the line without disturbing the unity of style but which, in less expert hands, had a disintegrating effect;
# to the disproportionate enlargement of single letters, especially at the beginnings and ends of lines;
# to ligatures, often very fantastic, which quite changed the forms of letters;
# to the enlargement of accents, breathings at the same time acquiring the modern rounded form.
But from the first there were several styles, varying from the formal, regular hands characteristic of service books to the informal style, marked by numerous abbreviations, used in manuscripts intended only for a scholar&#x27;s private use. The more formal hands were exceedingly conservative, and there are few classes of script more difficult to date than the Greek minuscule of this class. In the 10th, 11th and 12th centuries a sloping hand, less dignified than the upright, formal type, but often very handsome, was especially used for manuscripts of the classics.

Hands of the 11th century are marked in general (though there are exceptions) by a certain grace and delicacy, exact but easy; those of the 12th by a broad, bold sweep and an increasing freedom, which readily admits uncial forms, ligatures and enlarged letters but has not lost the sense of style and decorative effect. In the 13th and still more in the 14th centuries there was a steady decline; the less formal hands lost their beauty and exactness, becoming ever more disorderly and chaotic in their effect, while formal style imitated the precision of an earlier period without attaining its freedom and naturalness, and often appears singularly lifeless. In the 15th century, especially in the West, where Greek scribes were in request to produce manuscripts of the classical authors, there was a revival, and several manuscripts of this period, though markedly inferior to those of the 11th and 12th centuries, are by no means without beauty.

=== Accents, punctuation, and division of words ===
In the book-hand of early papyri, neither accents nor breathings were employed. Their use was established by the beginning of the Roman period, but was sporadic in papyri, where they were used as an aid to understanding, and therefore more frequently in poetry than prose, and in lyrical oftener than in other verse. In the cursive of papyri they are practically unknown, as are marks of punctuation. Punctuation was effected in early papyri, literary and documentary, by spaces, reinforced in the book-hand by the paragraphos, a horizontal stroke under the beginning of the line. The coronis, a more elaborate form of this, marked the beginning of lyrics or the principal sections of a longer work. Punctuation marks, the comma, the high, low and middle points, were established in the book-hand by the Roman period; in early Ptolemaic papyri, a double point () is found.

In vellum and paper manuscripts, punctuation marks and accents were regularly used from at least the 8th century, though with some differences from modern practice. At no period down to the invention of printing did Greek scribes consistently separate words. The book-hand of papyri aimed at an unbroken succession of letters, except for distinction of sections; in cursive hands, especially where abbreviations were numerous, some tendency to separate words may be recognised, but in reality it was phrases or groups of letters rather than words which were divided. In the later minuscule word-division is much commoner but never became systematic, accents and breathings serving of themselves to indicate the proper division.

== India ==

The view that the art of writing in India developed gradually, as in other areas of the world, by going through the stages of pictographic, ideographic and transitional phases of the phonetic script, which in turn developed into syllabic and alphabetic scripts was challenged by Falk and others in the early 1990s. In the new paradigm, Indian alphabetic writing, called Brahmi, was discontinuous with earlier, undeciphered, glyphs, and was invented specifically by King Ashoka for application in his royal edicts . In the subcontinent, Kharosthi (clearly derived from the Aramaic alphabet) was used at the same time in the northwest, next to Brahmi (at least influenced by Aramaic) elsewhere. In addition, the Greek alphabet were also added to the Indian context after its penetration in the early centuries AD, with the Arabic alphabet following in the 13th century. After a lapse of a few centuries the Kharoṣṭhi script became obsolete; the Greek script in India went through a similar fate and disappeared. But the Brahmi and Arabic scripts endured for a much longer period. Moreover, there was a change and development in the Brahmi script which may be traced in time and space through the Maurya, Kuṣaṇa, Gupta and early medieval periods. The present-day Nāgarī script is derived from Brahmi. The Brahmi is also the ancestral script of most other Indian scripts, in northern and southern South Asia. Legends and inscriptions in Brahmi are engraved upon leather, wood, terracotta, ivory, stone, copper, bronze, silver and gold. Arabic got an important place, particularly in the royalty, during the medieval period and it provides rich material for history writing. The decipherment and subsequent development of Indus glyphs is also a matter for continuing research and discussion.

Most of the available inscriptions and manuscripts written in the above scripts—in languages like Prakrit, Pali, Sanskrit, Apabhraṃśa, Tamil and Persian—have been read and exploited for history writing, but numerous inscriptions preserved in different museums still remain undeciphered for lack of competent palaeographic Indologists, as there is a gradual decline in the subcontinent of such disciplines as palaeography, epigraphy and numismatics. The discipline of ancient Indian scripts and the languages they are written needs new scholars who, by adopting traditional palaeographic methods and modern technology, may decipher, study and transcribe the various types of epigraphs and legends still extant today.

The language of the earliest written records, that is, the Edicts of Ashoka, is Prakrit. Besides Prakrit, the Ashokan edicts are also written in Greek and Aramaic. Moreover, all the edicts of Ashoka engraved in the Kharoshthi and Brahmi scripts are in the Prakrit language: thus, originally the language employed in the inscriptions was Prakrit, with Sanskrit adopted at a later stage. Past the period of the Maurya Empire, the use of Prakrit continued in inscriptions for a few more centuries. In north India, Prakrit was replaced by Sanskrit by the end of the 3rd century, while this change took place about a century later in south India. Some of the inscriptions though written in Prakrit, were influenced by Sanskrit and vice versa. The epigraphs of the Kushana kings are found in a mixture of Prakrit and Sanskrit, while the Mathura inscriptions of the time of Sodasa, belonging to the first quarter of the 1st century, contain verses in classical Sanskrit. From the 4th century onwards, the Gupta Empire came to power and supported the Sanskrit language and literature.

In western India and also in some regions of Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, Prakrit was used till the 4th century, mostly in the Buddhist writings though in a few contemporary records of the Ikshvakus of Nagarjunakonda, Sanskrit was applied. The inscription of Yajna Sri Satakarni (2nd century) from Amaravati is considered to be the earliest so far. The earlier writings (4th century) of Salankayanas of the Telugu region are in Prakrit, while their later records (belonging to the 5th century) are written in Sanskrit. In the Kannada speaking area, inscriptions belonging to later Satavahanas and Chutus were written in Prakrit. From the 4th century onwards, with the rise of the Guptas, Sanskrit became the predominant language of India and continued to be employed in texts and inscriptions of all parts of India along with the regional languages in the subsequent centuries. The copper-plate charters of the Pallavas, the Cholas and the Pandyas documents are written in both Sanskrit and Tamil. Kannada is used in texts dating from about the 5th century and the Halmidi inscription is considered to be the earliest epigraph written in the Kannada language. Inscriptions in Telugu began to appear from the 6th or 7th century. Malayalam made its beginning in writings from the 15th century onwards.

=== North India ===
In north India, the Brahmi script was used over a vast area; however, Ashokan inscriptions are also found using Kharoshthi, Aramaic and Greek scripts. With the advent of the Saka-Kshatrapas and the Kushanas as political powers in north India, the writing system underwent a definite change due to the use of new writing tools and techniques. Further development of the Brahmi script and perceivable changes in its evolutionary trend can be discerned during the Gupta period: in fact, the Gupta script is considered to be the successor of the Kushana script in north India.

From the 6th to about the 10th century, the inscriptions in north India were written in a script variously named, e.g., Siddhamatrika and Kutila (&quot;Rañjanā script&quot;). From the 8th century, Siddhamatrika developed into the Śāradā script in Kashmir and Punjab, into Proto-Bengali or Gaudi in Bengal and Orissa, and into Nagari in other parts of north India. Nagari script was used widely in northern India from the 10th century onwards. The use of Nandinagari, a variant of Nagari script, is mostly confined to the Karnataka region.

In central India, mostly in Madhya Pradesh, the inscriptions of the Vakatakas, and the kings of Sarabhapura and Kosala were written in what are known as &quot;box-headed&quot; and &quot;nail-headed&quot; characters. It may be noted that the early Kadambas of Karnataka also employed &quot;nail-headed&quot; characters in some of their inscriptions. During the 3rd–4th century, the script used in the inscriptions of Ikshvakus of Nagarjunakonda developed a unique style of letter-forms with elongated verticals and artistic flourishes, which did not continue after their rule.

=== South India ===
The earliest attested form of writing in South India is represented by inscriptions found in caves, associated with the Chalukya and Chera dynasties. These are written in variants of what is known as the Cave character, and their script differs from the Northern version in being more angular. Most of the modern scripts of South India have evolved from this script, with the exception of Vatteluttu, the exact origins of which are unknown, and Nandinagari, which is a variant of Devanagari that developed due to later Northern influence. In south India from the 7th century of the common era onwards, a number of inscriptions belonging to the dynasties of Pallava, Chola and Pandya are found. These records are written in three different scripts known as Tamil, Vattezhuttu and Grantha scripts, the last variety being used to write Sanskrit inscriptions. In the Kerala region, the Vattezhuttu script developed into a still more cursive script called Kolezhuthu during the 14th and 15th centuries. At the same time, the modern Malayalam script developed out of the Grantha script. The early form of the Telugu-Kannada script is found in the inscriptions of the early Kadambas of Banavasi and the early Chalukyas of Badami in the west, and Salankayana and the early Eastern Chalukyas in the east who ruled the Kannada and Telugu speaking areas respectively, during the 4th to 7th centuries.

== Latin ==

Attention should be drawn at the outset to certain fundamental definitions and principles of the science. The original characters of an alphabet are modified by the material and the implements used. When stone and chisel are discarded for papyrus and reed-pen, the hand encounters less resistance and moves more rapidly. This leads to changes in the size and position of the letters, and then to the joining of letters, and, consequently, to altered shapes. We are thus confronted at an early date with quite distinct types. The majuscule style of writing, based on two parallel lines, ADPL, is opposed to the minuscule, based on a system of four lines, with letters of unequal height, adpl. Another classification, according to the care taken in forming the letters, distinguishes between the set book-hand and the cursive script. The difference in this case is determined by the subject matter of the text; the writing used for books (&#x27;) is in all periods quite distinct from that used for letters and documents (&#x27;, &quot;&quot;). While the set book-hand, in majuscule or minuscule, shows a tendency to stabilise the forms of the letters, the cursive, often carelessly written, is continually changing in the course of years and according to the preferences of the writers.

This being granted, a summary survey of the morphological history of the Latin alphabet shows the zenith of its modifications at once, for its history is divided into two very unequal periods, the first dominated by majuscule and the second by minuscule writing.

=== Overview ===
Jean Mabillon, a French Benedictine monk, scholar and antiquary, whose work &quot;&quot; was published in 1681, is widely regarded as the founder of the twin disciplines of palaeography and diplomatics. However, the actual term &quot;palaeography&quot; was coined (in Latin) by Bernard de Montfaucon, a Benedictine monk, in the title of his &quot;Palaeographia Graeca&quot; (1708), which remained a standard work in the specific field of Greek palaeography for more than a century. With their establishment of palaeography, Mabillon and his fellow Benedictines were responding to the Jesuit Daniel Papebroch, who doubted the authenticity of some of the documents which the Benedictines offered as credentials for the authorisation of their monasteries. In the 19th century such scholars as Wilhelm Wattenbach, Leopold Delisle and Ludwig Traube contributed greatly to making palaeography independent from diplomatic. In the 20th century, the &quot;New French School&quot; of palaeographers, especially Jean Mallon, gave a new direction to the study of scripts by stressing the importance of ductus (the shape and order of the strokes used to compose letters) in studying the historical development of scripts.

=== Majuscule writing ===
==== Capital writing ====
The Latin alphabet first appears in the epigraphic type of majuscule writing, known as capitals. These characters form the main stem from which developed all the branches of Latin writing. On the oldest monuments (the &quot;inscriptiones bello Hannibalico antiquiores&quot; of the &quot;Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum = CIL&quot;), it is far from showing the orderly regularity of the later period. Side by side with upright and square characters are angular and sloping forms, sometimes very distorted, which seem to indicate the existence of an early cursive writing from which they would have been borrowed. Certain literary texts clearly allude to such a hand. Later, the characters of the cursive type were progressively eliminated from formal inscriptions, and capital writing reached its perfection in the Augustan Age.

Epigraphists divide the numerous inscriptions of this period into two quite distinct classes: &quot;tituli&quot;, or formal inscriptions engraved on stone in elegant and regular capitals, and &quot;acta&quot;, or legal texts, documents, etc., generally engraved on bronze in cramped and careless capitals. Palaeography inherits both these types. Reproduced by scribes on papyrus or parchment, the elegant characters of the inscriptions become the square capitals of the manuscripts, and the &quot;actuaria&quot;, as the writing of the &quot;acta&quot; is called, becomes the rustic capital.

Of the many books written in square capitals, the &quot;éditions de luxe&quot; of ancient times, only a few fragments have survived, the most famous being pages from manuscripts of Virgil. The finest examples of rustic capitals, the use of which is attested by papyri of the 1st century, are to be found in manuscripts of Virgil and Terence. Neither of these forms of capital writing offers any difficulty in reading, except that no space is left between the words. Their dates are still uncertain, in spite of attempts to determine them by minute observation.

The rustic capitals, more practical than the square forms, soon came into general use. This was the standard form of writing, so far as books are concerned, until the 5th century, when it was replaced by a new type, the uncial, which is discussed below.

==== Early cursive writing ====
While the set book-hand, in square or rustic capitals, was used for the copying of books, the writing of everyday life, letters and documents of all kinds, was in a cursive form, the oldest examples of which are provided by the graffiti on walls at Pompeii (&quot;CIL&quot;, iv), a series of waxen tablets, also discovered at Pompeii (&quot;CIL&quot;, iv, supplement), a similar series found at Verespatak in Transylvania (&quot;CIL&quot;, iii) and a number of papyri. From a study of a number of documents which exhibit transitional forms, it appears that this cursive was originally simplified capital writing. The evolution was so rapid, however, that at quite an early date the &quot;scriptura epistolaris&quot; of the Roman world can no longer be described as capitals. By the 1st century, this kind of writing began to develop the principal characteristics of two new types: the uncial and the minuscule cursive. With the coming into use of writing surfaces which were smooth, or offered little resistance, the unhampered haste of the writer altered the shape, size and position of the letters. In the earliest specimens of writing on wax, plaster or papyrus, there appears a tendency to represent several straight strokes by a single curve. The cursive writing thus foreshadows the specifically uncial forms. The same specimens show great inequality in the height of the letters; the main strokes are prolonged upwards (= ; = ) or downwards (= ; = ). In this direction, the cursive tends to become a minuscule hand.

==== Uncial writing ====
Although the characteristic forms of the uncial type appear to have their origin in the early cursive, the two hands are nevertheless quite distinct. The uncial is a &quot;libraria&quot;, closely related to the capital writing, from which it differs only in the rounding off of the angles of certain letters, principally . It represents a compromise between the beauty and legibility of the capitals and the rapidity of the cursive, and is clearly an artificial product. It was certainly in existence by the latter part of the 4th century, for a number of manuscripts of that date are written in perfect uncial hands (&quot;Exempla&quot;, pl. XX). It presently supplanted the capitals and appears in numerous manuscripts which have survived from the 5th, 6th and 7th centuries, when it was at its height. By this time it had become an imitative hand, in which there was generally no room for spontaneous development. It remained noticeably uniform over a long period. It is difficult therefore to date the manuscripts by palaeographical criteria alone. The most that can be done is to classify them by centuries, on the strength of tenuous data. The earliest uncial writing is easily distinguished by its simple and monumental character from the later hands, which become progressively stiff and affected.

=== Minuscule cursive writing ===
==== Early minuscule cursive ====
In the ancient cursive writing, from the 1st century onward, there are symptoms of transformation in the form of certain letters, the shape and proportions of which correspond more closely to the definition of minuscule writing than to that of majuscule. Rare and irregular at first, they gradually become more numerous and more constant and by degrees supplant the majuscule forms, so that in the history of the Roman cursive there is no precise boundary between the majuscule and minuscule periods.

The oldest example of minuscule cursive writing that has been discovered is a letter on papyrus, found in Egypt, dating from the 4th century. This marks a highly important date in the history of Latin writing, for with only one known exception, not yet adequately explained—two fragments of imperial rescripts of the 5th century—the minuscule cursive was consequently the only &quot;scriptura epistolaris&quot; of the Roman world. The ensuing succession of documents show a continuous improvement in this form of writing, characterised by the boldness of the strokes and by the elimination of the last lingering majuscule forms. The Ravenna deeds of the 5th and 6th centuries exhibit this hand at its perfection.

At this period, the minuscule cursive made its appearance as a &quot;book hand&quot;, first as marginal notes, and later for the complete books themselves. The only difference between the book-hand and that used for documents is that the principal strokes are shorter and the characters thicker. This form of the hand is usually called &quot;semi-cursive&quot;.

==== National hands ====
The fall of the Empire and the establishment of the barbarians within its former boundaries did not interrupt the use of the Roman minuscule cursive hand, which was adopted by the newcomers. But for gaps of over a century in the chronological series of documents which have been preserved, it would be possible to follow the evolution of the Roman cursive into the so-called &quot;national hands&quot;, forms of minuscule writing which flourished after the barbarian invasions in Italy, France, Spain, England and Ireland, and which are still known as Lombardic, Merovingian, Visigothic, Anglo-Saxon and Irish. These names came into use at a time when the various national hands were believed to have been invented by the peoples who used them, but their connotation is merely geographical. Nevertheless, in spite of a close resemblance which betrays their common origin, these hands are specifically different, perhaps because the Roman cursive was developed by each nation in accordance with its artistic tradition.

;&quot;Lombardic writing&quot;

In Italy, after the close of the Roman and Byzantine periods, the writing is known as Lombardic, a generic term which comprises several local varieties. These may be classified under four principal types: two for the &quot;scriptura epistolaris&quot;, the old Italian cursive and the papal chancery hand, or &quot;littera romana&quot;, and two for the &quot;libraria&quot;, the old Italian book-hand and Lombardic in the narrow sense, sometimes known as &quot;Beneventana&quot; because it flourished in the principality of Benevento.

The oldest preserved documents written in the old Italian cursive show all the essential characteristics of the Roman cursive of the 6th century. In northern Italy, this hand began in the 9th century to be influenced by a minuscule book-hand which developed, as will be seen later, in the time of Charlemagne; under this influence it gradually disappeared, and ceased to exist in the course of the 12th century. In southern Italy, it persisted far on into the later Middle Ages. The papal chancery hand, a variety of Lombardic peculiar to the vicinity of Rome and principally used in papal documents, is distinguished by the formation of the letters &quot;a, e, q, t&quot;. It is formal in appearance at first, but is gradually simplified, under the influence of the Carolingian minuscule, which finally prevailed in the bulls of Honorius II (1124–1130). The notaries public in Rome continued to use the papal chancery hand until the beginning of the 13th century. The old Italian book-hand is simply a semi-cursive of the type already described as in use in the 6th century. The principal examples are derived from &quot;scriptoria&quot; in northern Italy, where it was displaced by the Carolingian minuscule during the 9th century. In southern Italy, this hand persisted, developing into a calligraphic form of writing, and in the 10th century took on a very artistic angular appearance. The &quot;Exultet&quot; rolls provide the finest examples. In the 9th century, it was introduced in Dalmatia by the Benedictine monks and developed there, as in Apulia, on the basis of the archetype, culminating in a rounded &quot;Beneventana&quot; known as the &quot;Bari type&quot;.

;&quot;Merovingian&quot;

The offshoot of the Roman cursive which developed in Gaul under the first dynasty of kings is called Merovingian writing. It is represented by thirty-eight royal diplomas, a number of private charters and the authenticating documents of relics.

Though less than a century intervenes between the Ravenna cursive and the oldest extant Merovingian document (AD 625), there is a great difference in appearance between the two writings. The facile flow of the former is replaced by a cramped style, in which the natural slope to the right gives way to an upright hand, and the letters, instead of being fully outlined, are compressed to such an extent that they modify the shape of other letters. Copyists of books used a cursive similar to that found in documents, except that the strokes are thicker, the forms more regular, and the heads and tails shorter. The Merovingian cursive as used in books underwent simplification in some localities, undoubtedly through the influence of the minuscule book-hand of the period. The two principal centres of this reform were Luxeuil and Corbie.

;&quot;Visigothic&quot;

In Spain, after the Visigothic conquest, the Roman cursive gradually developed special characteristics. Some documents attributed to the 7th century display a transitional hand with straggling and rather uncouth forms. The distinctive features of Visigothic writing, the most noticeable of which is certainly the q-shaped , did not appear until later, in the book-hand. The book-hand became set at an early date. In the 8th century it appears as a sort of semi-cursive; the earliest example of certain date is ms lxxxix in the Capitular Library in Verona. From the 9th century the calligraphic forms become broader and more rounded until the 11th century, when they become slender and angular. The Visigothic minuscule appears in a cursive form in documents about the middle of the 9th century, and in the course of time grows more intricate and consequently less legible. It soon came into competition with the Carolingian minuscule, which supplanted it as a result of the presence in Spain of French elements such as Cluniac monks and warriors engaged in the campaign against the Moors.

The Irish and Anglo-Saxon hands, which were not directly derived from the Roman minuscule cursive, will be discussed in a separate sub-section below.

=== Set minuscule writing ===
One by one, the national minuscule cursive hands were replaced by a set minuscule hand which has already been mentioned and its origins may now be traced from the beginning.

==== Half-uncial writing ====
The early cursive was the medium in which the minuscule forms were gradually evolved from the corresponding majuscule forms. Minuscule writing was therefore cursive in its inception. As the minuscule letters made their appearance in the cursive writing of documents, they were adopted and given calligraphic form by the copyists of literary texts, so that the set minuscule alphabet was constituted gradually, letter by letter, following the development of the minuscule cursive. Just as some documents written in the early cursive show a mixture of majuscule and minuscule forms, so certain literary papyri of the 3rd century, and inscriptions on stone of the 4th century yield examples of a mixed set hand, with minuscule forms side by side with capital and uncial letters. The number of minuscule forms increases steadily in texts written in the mixed hand, and especially in marginal notes, until by the end of the 5th century the majuscule forms have almost entirely disappeared in some manuscripts. This quasi-minuscule writing, known as the &quot;half-uncial&quot; thus derives from a long line of mixed hands which, in a synoptic chart of Latin scripts, would appear close to the oldest &quot;librariae&quot;, and between them and the &quot;epistolaris&quot; (cursive), from which its characteristic forms were successively derived. It had a considerable influence on the continental &quot;scriptura libraria&quot; of the 7th and 8th centuries.

==== Irish and Anglo-Saxon writing ====
The half-uncial hand was introduced in Ireland along with Latin culture in the 5th century by priests and laymen from Gaul, fleeing before the barbarian invasions. It was adopted there to the exclusion of the cursive, and soon took on a distinct character. There are two well established classes of Irish writing as early as the 7th century: a large round half-uncial hand, in which certain majuscule forms frequently appear, and a pointed hand, which becomes more cursive and more genuinely minuscule. The latter developed out of the former. One of the distinguishing marks of manuscripts of Irish origin is to be found in the initial letters, which are ornamented by interlacing, animal forms, or a frame of red dots. The most certain evidence, however, is provided by the system of abbreviations and by the combined square and cuneiform appearance of the minuscule at the height of its development. The two types of Irish writing were introduced in the north of Great Britain by the monks, and were soon adopted by the Anglo-Saxons, being so exactly copied that it is sometimes difficult to determine the origin of an example. Gradually, however, the Anglo-Saxon writing developed a distinct style, and even local types, which were superseded after the Norman conquest by the Carolingian minuscule. Through St Columbanus and his followers, Irish writing spread to the continent, and manuscripts were written in the Irish hand in the monasteries of Bobbio Abbey and St Gall during the 7th and 8th centuries.

==== Pre-Caroline ====
James J. John points out that the disappearance of imperial authority around the end of the 5th century in most of the Latin-speaking half of the Roman Empire does not entail the disappearance of the Latin scripts, but rather introduced conditions that would allow the various provinces of the West gradually to drift apart in their writing habits, a process that began around the 7th century.

Pope Gregory I (Gregory the Great, d. 604) was influential in the spread of Christianity to Britain and also sent Queens Theodelinde and Brunhilda, as well as Spanish bishops, copies of manuscripts. Furthermore, he sent the Roman monk Augustine of Canterbury to Britain on a missionary journey, on which Augustine may have brought manuscripts. Although Italy&#x27;s dominance as a centre of manuscript production began to decline, especially after the Gothic War (535–554) and the invasions by the Lombards, its manuscripts—and more important, the scripts in which they were written—were distributed across Europe.

From the 6th through the 8th centuries, a number of so-called &#x27;national hands&#x27; were developed throughout the Latin-speaking areas of the former Roman Empire. By the late 6th century Irish scribes had begun transforming Roman scripts into Insular minuscule and majuscule scripts. A series of transformations, for book purposes, of the cursive documentary script that had grown out of the later Roman cursive would get under way in France by the mid-7th century. In Spain half-uncial and cursive would both be transformed into a new script, the Visigothic minuscule, no later than the early 8th century.

==== Carolingian minuscule ====

Beginning in the 8th century, as Charlemagne began to consolidate power over a large area of western Europe, scribes developed a minuscule script (Caroline minuscule) that effectively became the standard script for manuscripts from the 9th to the 11th centuries. The origin of this hand is much disputed. This is due to the confusion which prevailed before the Carolingian period in the &quot;libraria&quot; in France, Italy and Germany as a result of the competition between the cursive and the set hands. In addition to the calligraphic uncial and half-uncial writings, which were imitative forms, little used and consequently without much vitality, and the minuscule cursive, which was the most natural hand, there were innumerable varieties of mixed writing derived from the influence of these hands on each other. In some, the uncial or half-uncial forms were preserved with little or no modification, but the influence of the cursive is shown by the freedom of the strokes; these are known as rustic, semi-cursive or cursive uncial or half-uncial hands. Conversely, the cursive was sometimes affected, in varying degrees, by the set &quot;librariae&quot;; the cursive of the &quot;epistolaris&quot; became a semi-cursive when adopted as a &quot;libraria&quot;. Nor is this all. Apart from these reciprocal influences affecting the movement of the hand across the page, there were morphological influences at work, letters being borrowed from one alphabet for another. This led to compromises of all sorts and of infinite variety between the uncial and half-uncial and the cursive. It will readily be understood that the origin of the Carolingian minuscule, which must be sought in this tangle of pre-Carolingian hands, involves disagreement. The new writing is admittedly much more closely related to the &quot;epistolaris&quot; than the primitive minuscule; this is shown by certain forms, such as the open &quot;&quot; (), which recall the cursive, by the joining of certain letters, and by the clubbing of the tall letters b d h l, which resulted from a cursive &quot;ductus&quot;. Most palaeographers agree in assigning the new hand the place shown in the following table:
Controversy turns on the question whether the Carolingian minuscule is the primitive minuscule as modified by the influence of the cursive or a cursive based on the primitive minuscule. Its place of origin is also uncertain: Rome, the Palatine school, Tours, Reims, Metz, Saint-Denis and Corbie have been suggested, but no agreement has been reached. In any case, the appearance of the new hand is a turning point in the history of culture. So far as Latin writing is concerned, it marks the dawn of modern times.

==== Gothic minuscule ====
In the 12th century, Carolingian minuscule underwent a change in its appearance and adopted bold and broken Gothic letter-forms. This style remained predominant, with some regional variants, until the 15th century, when the Renaissance humanistic scripts revived a version of Carolingian minuscule. It then spread from the Italian Renaissance all over Europe.

== Rise of modern writing ==
These humanistic scripts are the base for the antiqua and the handwriting forms in western and southern Europe. In Germany and Austria, the &quot;Kurrentschrift&quot; was rooted in the cursive handwriting of the later Middle Ages. With the name of the calligrapher Ludwig Sütterlin, this handwriting counterpart to the blackletter typefaces was abolished by Hitler in 1941. After World War II, it was taught as an alternative script in some areas until the 1970s; it is no longer taught. Secretary hand is an informal business hand of the Renaissance.

=== Developments ===
There are undeniable points of contact between architecture and palaeography, and in both it is possible to distinguish a Romanesque and a Gothic period . The creative effort which began in the post-Carolingian period culminated at the beginning of the 12th century in a calligraphy and an architecture which, though still somewhat awkward, showed unmistakable signs of power and experience, and at the end of that century and in the first half of the 13th both arts reached their climax and made their boldest flights.

The topography of later medieval writing is still being studied; national varieties can, of course, be identified but the problem of distinguishing features becomes complicated as a result of the development of international relations, and the migration of clerks from one end of Europe to the other. During the later centuries of the Middle Ages the Gothic minuscule continued to improve within the restricted circle of &quot;de luxe&quot; editions and ceremonial documents. In common use, it degenerated into a cursive which became more and more intricate, full of superfluous strokes and complicated by abbreviations.

In the first quarter of the 15th century an innovation took place which exercised a decisive influence on the evolution of writing in Europe. The Italian humanists were struck by the eminent legibility of the manuscripts, written in the improved Carolingian minuscule of the 10th and 11th centuries, in which they discovered the works of ancient authors, and carefully imitated the old writing. In Petrarch&#x27;s compact book hand, the wider leading and reduced compression and round curves are early manifestations of the reaction against the crabbed Gothic secretarial minuscule we know today as &quot;blackletter&quot;.

Petrarch was one of the few medieval authors to have written at any length on the handwriting of his time; in his essay on the subject, &quot;La scrittura&quot; he criticized the current scholastic hand, with its laboured strokes (&quot;artificiosis litterarum tractibus&quot;) and exuberant (&quot;luxurians&quot;) letter-forms amusing the eye from a distance, but fatiguing on closer exposure, as if written for other purpose than to be read. For Petrarch the gothic hand violated three principles: writing, he said, should be simple (&quot;castigata&quot;), clear (&quot;clara&quot;) and orthographically correct. Boccaccio was a great admirer of Petrarch; from Boccaccio&#x27;s immediate circle this post-Petrarchan &quot;semi-gothic&quot; revised hand spread to &quot;literati&quot; in Florence, Lombardy and the Veneto.

A more thorough reform of handwriting than the Petrarchan compromise was in the offing. The generator of the new style (&quot;illustration&quot;) was Poggio Bracciolini, a tireless pursuer of ancient manuscripts, who developed the new humanist script in the first decade of the 15th century. The Florentine bookseller Vespasiano da Bisticci recalled later in the century that Poggio had been a very fine calligrapher of &quot;lettera antica&quot; and had transcribed texts to support himself—presumably, as Martin Davies points out— before he went to Rome in 1403 to begin his career in the papal curia. Berthold Ullman identifies the watershed moment in the development of the new humanistic hand as the youthful Poggio&#x27;s transcription of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Epistles to Atticus&quot;.

By the time the Medici library was catalogued in 1418, almost half the manuscripts were noted as in the &quot;lettera antica&quot;. The new script was embraced and developed by the Florentine humanists and educators Niccolò de&#x27; Niccoli and Coluccio Salutati. The papal chancery adopted the new fashion for some purposes, and thus contributed to its diffusion throughout Christendom. The printers played a still more significant part in establishing this form of writing by using it, from the year 1465, as the basis for their types.

The humanistic minuscule soon gave rise to a sloping cursive hand, known as the Italian, which was also taken up by printers in search of novelty and thus became the italic type. In consequence, the Italian hand became widely used, and in the 16th century began to compete with the Gothic cursive. In the 17th century, writing masters were divided between the two schools, and there was in addition a whole series of compromises. The Gothic characters gradually disappeared, except a few that survived in Germany. The Italian became universally used, brought to perfection in more recent times by English calligraphers.

<text>A pollutant or novel entity is a substance or energy introduced into the environment that has undesired effect, or adversely affects the usefulness of a resource. These can be both naturally forming (i.e. minerals or extracted compounds like oil) or anthropogenic in origin (i.e. manufactured materials or byproducts). Pollutants result in environmental pollution or become of public health concern when they reach a concentration high enough to have significant negative impacts. 

A pollutant may cause long- or short-term damage by changing the growth rate of plant or animal species, or by interfering with resources used by humans, human health or wellbeing, or property values. Some pollutants are biodegradable and therefore will not persist in the environment in a long term. However, the degradation products of some pollutants are themselves pollutants such as DDE and DDD produced from the degradation of DDT.

Pollution has widespread negative impact on the environment. When analyzed from a planetary boundaries perspective, human society has released novel entities that well exceed safe levels.

== Different types of pollutants in the environment ==
Pollutants can be categorized in a variety of different ways. For example, it is sometimes useful to distinguish between &quot;stock pollutants&quot; and &quot;fund pollutants&quot;. Another way is to group them together according to more specific properties, such as organic, particulate, pharmaceutical, et cetera. The environment has some capacity to absorb many discharges without measurable harm, and this is called “assimilative capacity (or absorptive capacity); a pollutant actually causes pollution when the assimilative capacity is exceeded.

===Stock pollutants===
Pollutants, towards which the environment has low absorptive capacity are called &quot;stock pollutants&quot;. Examples include persistent organic pollutants like PCBs, non-biodegradable plastics and heavy metals. Stock pollutants accumulate in the environment over time. The damage they cause increases as more pollutant is emitted, and persists as the pollutant accumulates. Stock pollutants can create a burden for the future generations, bypassing on the damage that persists well after the benefits received from incurring that damage, have been forgotten. Scientists have officially deemed that the planetary boundaries safe chemical pollutant levels (novel entities) have been surpassed.

===Fund pollutants===
In contrast to stock pollutants, for which the environment has low absorptive capacity, fund pollutants are those for which the environment has a moderate absorptive capacity. Fund pollutants do not cause damage to the environment unless the emission rate exceeds the receiving environment&#x27;s absorptive capacity (e.g. carbon dioxide, which is absorbed by plants and oceans). Fund pollutants are not destroyed, but rather converted into less harmful substances, or diluted/dispersed to non-harmful concentrations.

=== Specific groups of pollutants ===
Many pollutants are within the following notable groups:

* Environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants (EPPP)
* Greenhouse gases (GHGs)
* Particulate matter (PM)
* Persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
* Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
* Volatile organic compounds (VOCs)

=== Light pollutant ===
Light pollution is the impact that anthropogenic light has on the visibility of the night sky. It also encompasses ecological light pollution which describes the effect of artificial light on individual organisms and on the structure of ecosystems as a whole. 

==Zones of influence==
Pollutants can also be defined by their zones of influence, both horizontally and vertically.

===Horizontal zone===
The horizontal zone refers to the area that is damaged by a pollutant. Local pollutants cause damage near the emission source. Regional pollutants cause damage further from the emission source.

===Vertical zone===
The vertical zone refers to whether the damage is ground-level or atmospheric. Surface pollutants cause damage by accumulating near the Earth&#x27;s surface. Global pollutants cause damage by concentrating on the [atmosphere].

== Measuring concentration ==
==Regulation==
===International===
Pollutants can cross international borders and therefore international regulations are needed for their control. The Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, which entered into force in 2004, is an international legally binding agreement for the control of persistent organic pollutants. Pollutant Release and Transfer Registers (PRTR) are systems to collect and disseminate information on environmental releases and transfers of toxic chemicals from industrial and other facilities.

===European Union===
The European Pollutant Emission Register is a type of PRTR providing access to information on the annual emissions of industrial facilities in the Member States of the European Union, as well as Norway.

===United States===
Clean Air Act standards. Under the Clean Air Act, the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) are developed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for six common air pollutants, also called &quot;criteria pollutants&quot;: particulates; smog and ground-level ozone; carbon monoxide; sulfur oxides; nitrogen oxides; and lead. The National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants are additional emission standards that are set by EPA for toxic air pollutants.

Clean Water Act standards. Under the Clean Water Act, EPA promulgated national standards for municipal sewage treatment plants, also called &quot;publicly owned treatment works,&quot; in the &quot;Secondary Treatment Regulation.&quot; National standards for industrial dischargers are called &quot;Effluent guidelines&quot; (for existing sources) and New Source Performance Standards, and currently cover over 50 industrial categories. In addition, the Act requires states to publish water quality standards for individual water bodies to provide additional protection where the national standards are insufficient.

RCRA standards. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) regulates the management, transport and disposal of municipal solid waste, hazardous waste and underground storage tanks.

<text>Pepsi is a carbonated soft drink with a cola flavor, manufactured by PepsiCo. In 2023, Pepsi was the second most valuable soft drink brand worldwide behind Coca-Cola; the two share a long-standing rivalry in what has been called the &quot;cola wars&quot;.

Pepsi, originally created in 1893 by Caleb Bradham and named &quot;Brad&#x27;s Drink,&quot; was first sold in his drugstore in New Bern, North Carolina. Renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898 due to its supposed digestive benefits, it was shortened to Pepsi in 1961. The beverage&#x27;s formula initially included sugar and vanilla but not pepsin, despite speculation on the origin of its name. Early on, Pepsi struggled with financial stability, going bankrupt in 1923 but was subsequently purchased and revived by Charles Guth, who reformulated the syrup. Pepsi gained popularity with the introduction of a 12-ounce bottle during the Great Depression and clever marketing strategies like the &quot;Nickel, Nickel&quot; jingle, doubling sales by emphasizing its value.

The mid-20th century saw Pepsi targeting the African American market, a then-untapped demographic, with positive portrayals and endorsements from prominent figures, boosting its market share. Despite occasional controversies, such as an aborted Madonna advertisement and the &quot;Pepsi Number Fever&quot; fiasco in the Philippines, Pepsi has remained a prominent global brand, partly thanks to innovative marketing campaigns and sponsorships in sports and entertainment.

Pepsi&#x27;s rivalry with Coca-Cola, highlighted by the &quot;cola wars&quot;, led to significant cultural and market competition, including the &quot;Pepsi Challenge&quot; taste tests and the introduction of New Coke in response. Pepsi&#x27;s expansion into international markets has seen varied success, with notable ventures into the Soviet Union via a landmark barter deal and enduring popularity in certain regions over Coca-Cola. As of the early 21st century, Pepsi continues to innovate, both in product variations and marketing strategies, while maintaining a significant presence in the global soft drink industry.

==History==
Pepsi was first invented in 1893 as &quot;Brad&#x27;s Drink&quot; by Caleb Bradham, who sold the drink at his drugstore in New Bern, North Carolina.

It was renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898, &quot;Pepsi&quot; because it was advertised to relieve dyspepsia (indigestion) and &quot;Cola&quot; referring to the cola flavor. Some have also suggested that &quot;Pepsi&quot; may have been a reference to the drink aiding digestion like the digestive enzyme pepsin, but pepsin itself was never used as an ingredient to Pepsi-Cola.

The original recipe also included sugar and vanilla. Bradham sought to create a fountain drink that was appealing and would aid in digestion and boost energy.

In 1903, Bradham moved the bottling of Pepsi from his drugstore to a rented warehouse. That year, Bradham sold 7,968 gallons of syrup. The next year, Pepsi was sold in six-ounce bottles, and sales increased to 19,848 gallons. In 1909, automobile race pioneer Barney Oldfield was the first celebrity to endorse Pepsi, describing it as &quot;A bully drink...refreshing, invigorating, a fine bracer before a race.&quot; The advertising theme &quot;Delicious and Healthful&quot; was then used over the next two decades.
In 1923, the Pepsi-Cola Company entered bankruptcy—in large part due to financial losses incurred by speculating on the wildly fluctuating sugar prices as a result of World War I. Assets were sold and Roy C. Megargel bought the Pepsi trademark. Megargel was unsuccessful in efforts to find funding to revive the brand and soon Pepsi-Cola&#x27;s assets were purchased by Charles Guth, the president of Loft, Inc. Loft was a candy manufacturer with retail stores that contained soda fountains. He sought to replace Coca-Cola at his stores&#x27; fountains after The Coca-Cola Company refused to give him additional discounts on syrup. Guth then had Loft&#x27;s chemists reformulate the Pepsi-Cola syrup formula.
On three occasions between 1922 and 1933, the Coca-Cola Company was offered the opportunity to purchase the Pepsi-Cola Company, which it declined on each occasion.

===Growth in popularity===
During the Great Depression, Pepsi gained popularity following the introduction in 1934 of a 12-ounce (355 mL) bottle. Prior to that, Pepsi and Coca-Cola sold their drinks in 6.5-ounce (192 mL) servings for about $0.05 a bottle. With a radio advertising campaign featuring the popular jingle &quot;Nickel, Nickel&quot; – first recorded by the Tune Twisters in 1940 – Pepsi encouraged price-conscious consumers to double the volume their nickels could purchase. The jingle is arranged in a way that loops, creating a never-ending tune:&quot;Pepsi-Cola hits the spot / Twelve full ounces, that&#x27;s a lot / Twice as much for a nickel, too / Pepsi-Cola is the drink for you.&quot;Coming at a time of economic crisis, the campaign succeeded in boosting Pepsi&#x27;s status. From 1936 to 1938, Pepsi-Cola&#x27;s profits doubled.
Pepsi&#x27;s success under Charles Guth came while the Loft Candy business was faltering. Since he had initially used Loft&#x27;s finances and facilities to establish the new Pepsi success, the near-bankrupt Loft Company sued Guth for possession of the Pepsi-Cola company. A long legal battle, &quot;Guth v. Loft&quot;, then ensued, with the case reaching the Delaware Supreme Court and ultimately ending in a loss for Guth.

===Marketing===


From the 1930s through the late 1950s, &quot;Pepsi-Cola Hits The Spot&quot; was the most commonly used slogan in the days of old-time radio, classic motion pictures and early days of television. Its jingle (conceived in the days when Pepsi cost only five cents) was used in many different forms with different lyrics. With the rise of radio, Pepsi-Cola utilized the services of a young, up-and-coming actress named Polly Bergen to promote products, oftentimes, lending her singing talents to the classic &quot;...Hits The Spot&quot; jingle.

Film actress Joan Crawford, after marrying Pepsi-Cola president Alfred N. Steele became a spokesperson for Pepsi, appearing in commercials, television specials, and televised beauty pageants on behalf of the company. Crawford also had images of the soft drink placed prominently in several of her later films. When Steele died in 1959, Crawford was appointed to the Board of Directors of Pepsi-Cola, a position she held until 1973, although she was not a board member of the larger PepsiCo, created in 1965.

Pepsi has been featured in several films, including &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; (1989), &quot;Home Alone&quot; (1990), &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; (1992), &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999), &quot;World War Z&quot; (2013), and in films directed by Spike Lee.

Pepsi marketing has also been marred in controversy. In 1989, Pepsi commissioned a $5 million marketing campaign to coincide with the release of Madonna&#x27;s song &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, but was cancelled following strong backlash regarding the religious themes in the song&#x27;s music video. In 1992, the Pepsi Number Fever marketing campaign in the Philippines accidentally distributed 800,000 winning bottle caps for a 1 million peso grand prize, leading to riots and the deaths of five people.

In 1996, PepsiCo launched the highly successful Pepsi Stuff marketing strategy. &quot;Project Blue&quot; was launched in several international markets outside the United States in April. The launch included extravagant publicity stunts, such as a Concorde airplane painted in blue colors (which was owned by Air France) and a banner on the Mir space station. The Project Blue design was first tested in the United States in June 1997, and was released that December in preparation for Pepsi&#x27;s 100th anniversary. It was at this point, the logo began to be referred to as the Pepsi Globe.

In October 2008, Pepsi announced that it would redesign its logo and re-brand many of its products by early 2009. In 2009, Pepsi, Diet Pepsi, and Pepsi Max began using all lower-case fonts for name brands. The brand&#x27;s blue and red globe trademark became a series of &quot;smiles,&quot; with the central white band initially arcing at different angles depending on the product. In March 2023, Pepsi unveiled a new logo expected to launch in North America in late-2023, and internationally in 2024 (including 2025 in Colombia). The logo is a modernization of the &quot;vintage&quot; Pepsi logo; accompanying branding elements will also shift from blue to black as their primary color. 

====Niche marketing====

Walter Mack was named the new president of Pepsi-Cola and guided the company through the 1940s. Mack, who supported progressive causes, noticed that the company&#x27;s strategy of using advertising for a general audience either ignored African Americans or used ethnic stereotypes in portraying Blacks. Up until the 1940s, the full revenue potential of what was called &quot;the Negro market&quot; was largely ignored by white-owned manufacturers in the U.S. 

Mack realized that Black people were an untapped niche market and that Pepsi stood to gain market share by targeting its advertising directly towards them. To this end, he hired Hennan Smith, an advertising executive &quot;from the Negro newspaper field&quot; to lead an all-black sales team, which had to be cut due to the onset of World War II.
In 1947, Walter Mack resumed his efforts, hiring Edward F. Boyd to lead a twelve-man team. They came up with advertising portraying black Americans in a positive light, such as one with a smiling mother holding a six pack of Pepsi while her son (a young Ron Brown, who grew up to be Secretary of Commerce) reaches up for one. Another ad campaign, titled &quot;Leaders in Their Fields&quot;, profiled twenty prominent African Americans such as Nobel Peace Prize winner Ralph Bunche and photographer Gordon Parks.

Boyd also led a sales team composed entirely of blacks around the country to promote Pepsi. Racial segregation and Jim Crow laws were still in place throughout much of the U.S.; Boyd&#x27;s team faced a great deal of discrimination as a result, from insults by Pepsi co-workers to threats by the Ku Klux Klan. On the other hand, it was able to use its anti-racism stance as a selling point, attacking Coke&#x27;s reluctance to hire blacks and support by the chairman of The Coca-Cola Company for segregationist governor of Georgia Herman Talmadge. As a result, Pepsi&#x27;s market share as compared to Coca-Cola&#x27;s shot up dramatically in the 1950s with African American soft-drink consumers three times more likely to purchase Pepsi over Coke. After the sales team visited Chicago, Pepsi&#x27;s share in the city overtook that of Coke for the first time.

Journalist Stephanie Capparell interviewed six men who were on the team in the late 1940s. The team members had a grueling schedule, working seven days a week, morning and night, for weeks on end. They visited bottlers, churches, ladies groups, schools, college campuses, YMCAs, community centers, insurance conventions, teacher and doctor conferences, and various civic organizations. They got famous jazzmen such as Duke Ellington and Lionel Hampton to promote Pepsi from the stage. No group was too small or too large to target for a promotion.

Pepsi advertisements avoided the stereotypical images common in the major media that depicted Aunt Jemimas and Uncle Bens, whose role was to draw a smile from white customers. Instead, it portrayed black customers as self-confident middle-class citizens who showed very good taste in their soft drinks. They were economical too, as Pepsi bottles were twice the size.

This focus on the market for black people caused some consternation within the company and among its affiliates. It did not want to seem focused on black customers for fear white customers would be pushed away. In a national meeting, Mack tried to assuage the 500 bottlers in attendance by pandering to them, saying &quot;We don&#x27;t want it to become known as a nigger drink.&quot; After Mack left the company in 1950, support for the black sales team faded and it was cut.

Boyd was replaced in 1952 by Harvey C. Russell Jr., who was notable for his marketing campaigns towards black youth in New Orleans. These campaigns, held at locales attended largely by black children, would encourage children to collect Pepsi bottle caps, which they could then exchange for rewards. One example is Pepsi&#x27;s 1954 &quot;Pepsi Day at the Beach&quot; event, where New Orleans children could ride rides at an amusement park in exchange for Pepsi bottle caps. By the end of the event, 125,000 bottle caps been collected. According to &quot;The Pepsi Cola World&quot;, the New Orleans campaign was a success; once people&#x27;s supply of bottle caps ran out, the only way they could get more was to buy more Pepsi.

====Rivalry with Coca-Cola====

According to Consumer Reports, in the 1970s, the rivalry continued to heat up the market. Pepsi conducted blind taste tests in stores, in what was called the &quot;Pepsi Challenge&quot;. These tests suggested that more consumers preferred the taste of Pepsi to Coca-Cola. The sales of Pepsi started to climb, and Pepsi kicked off the &quot;Challenge&quot; across the nation. This became known as the &quot;cola wars&quot;.

In 1985, The Coca-Cola Company, amid much publicity, changed its formula. The theory has been advanced that New Coke, as the reformulated drink came to be known, was invented specifically in response to the Pepsi Challenge. However, a consumer backlash led to Coca-Cola quickly reintroducing the original formula as &quot;Coca-Cola Classic&quot;.

In 1989, Billy Joel mentioned the rivalry between the two companies in the song &quot;We Didn&#x27;t Start the Fire&quot;. The line &quot;Rock &amp; Roller Cola Wars&quot; refers to Pepsi and Coke&#x27;s usage of various musicians in advertising campaigns. Coke used Paula Abdul, while Pepsi used Michael Jackson. Both companies then competed to get other musicians to advertise its beverages.

According to &quot;Beverage Digest&quot;″s 2008 report on carbonated soft drinks, PepsiCo&#x27;s U.S. market share is 30.8 percent, while The Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s is 42.7 percent. Coca-Cola outsells Pepsi in most parts of the U.S., notable exceptions being central Appalachia, Montana, North Dakota, and Utah. In the city of Buffalo, New York, Pepsi outsells Coca-Cola by a two-to-one margin. As of 2024, Pepsi had fallen behind Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper as the third most popular soft drink in the United States, losing its second place spot to the aforementioned Dr Pepper, a position it had held since 1985.

Overall, Coca-Cola continues to outsell Pepsi in almost all areas of the world. However, exceptions include: Oman, India, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, the Canadian provinces of Quebec, Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

Pepsi had long been the drink of French-Canadians, and it continues to hold its dominance by relying on local Québécois celebrities (especially Claude Meunier, of &quot;La Petite Vie&quot; fame) to sell its product. PepsiCo introduced the Quebec slogan &quot;here, it&#x27;s Pepsi&quot; () in response to Coca-Cola ads proclaiming &quot;Around the world, it&#x27;s Coke&quot; ().

In India, by most accounts, Coca-Cola was India&#x27;s leading soft drink until 1977, when it left India because of the new foreign exchange laws which mandated majority shareholding in companies to be held by Indian shareholders; Coca-Cola was unwilling to dilute its stake in its Indian unit as required by the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, which would have forced them to share their formula with an entity in which it did not have majority shareholding. In 1988, PepsiCo entered the Indian market by creating a joint venture with the government of Punjab-owned Punjab Agro Industrial Corporation and Voltas India Limited. This joint venture marketed and sold Lehar Pepsi until 1991, when the use of foreign brands was allowed; PepsiCo promptly bought out its partners and ended the joint venture in 1994. In 1993, Coca-Cola returned to the Indian market in pursuance of India&#x27;s liberalization policy. As of 2012, Pepsi is the third most popular carbonated drink in India, with a 15% market share, behind Sprite and Thums Up. In comparison, Coca-Cola is the fourth most popular carbonated drink, occupying a mere 8.8% of the Indian market share.

In Russia, Pepsi initially had a larger market share than Coke, but it was undercut once the Cold War ended. In 1972, PepsiCo struck a barter agreement with the government of the Soviet Union, in which PepsiCo was granted exportation and Western marketing rights to Stolichnaya vodka in exchange for importation and Soviet marketing of Pepsi. This exchange led to Pepsi being the first foreign product sanctioned for sale in the Soviet Union. Reminiscent of the way that Coca-Cola became a cultural icon and its global spread spawned words like &quot;cocacolonization&quot;, Pepsi and its relation to the Soviet system turned it into an icon. In the early 1990s, the term &quot;Pepsi-stroika&quot; began appearing as a pun on &quot;perestroika&quot;, the reform policy of the Soviet Union under Mikhail Gorbachev. Critics viewed the policy as an attempt to usher in Western products in deals there with the old elites; Pepsi, as one of the first American products in the Soviet Union, became a symbol of that relationship and the Soviet policy, reflected in Russian author Victor Pelevin&#x27;s book &quot;Generation P&quot;. In 1992, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Coca-Cola was introduced to the Russian market and rapidly captured a significant market share due to public perceptions of Coca-Cola as representative of the new post-Soviet system (as opposed to Pepsi being exemplary of the old Soviet era), a market growth that might otherwise have required years to achieve. By July 2005, Coca-Cola enjoyed a market share of 19.4 percent, followed by Pepsi with 13 percent.

Pepsi was introduced in Romania in 1966, during the early liberalization policies of Nicolae Ceaușescu, opening a factory at Constanța in 1967. This was done as a barter agreement similar to the one in the USSR, with Romanian wine serving as their bartered drink sold in the West. Pepsi quickly became popular in Romania, especially among young people, but due to the austerity measures imposed in the 1980s, it became scarce and difficult to find. After the fall of Soviet communism in 1991, PepsiCo entered the new Romanian market economy, and still maintains a bigger popularity than Coca-Cola, which was introduced in Romania in 1992, despite heavy competition during the 1990s (sometime between 2000 and 2005, Pepsi overtook Coca-Cola in sales in Romania).

Pepsi did not sell soft drinks in Israel until 1991. Many Israelis and some American Jewish organizations attributed Pepsi&#x27;s previous reluctance to expand operations in Israel to fears of an Arab boycott. Pepsi, which has a large and lucrative business in the Arab world, denied the claims, stating that economic, rather than political, reasons kept it out of Israel.

====Pepsiman====
Pepsiman is an official Pepsi mascot from Pepsi&#x27;s Japanese corporate branch, created sometime around the mid-1990s. Pepsiman took on three different outfits, each one representing the current style of the Pepsi can in distribution. Twelve commercials were created featuring the character. His role in the advertisements is to appear with Pepsi to thirsty people or people craving soda. 

Pepsiman happens to appear at just the right time with the product. After delivering the beverage, sometimes Pepsiman would encounter a difficult and action-oriented situation which would result in injury. Pepsiman is mostly silent, and he has no face except for a hole that opens up whenever he delivers a Pepsi. Another more minor mascot, Pepsiwoman, also featured in a few of her own commercials for Pepsi Twist; her appearance is basically a female Pepsiman wearing a lemon-shaped balaclava.

In 1994, Sega-AM2 released the Sega Saturn version of its arcade fighting game &quot;Fighting Vipers&quot;. In this game, Pepsiman was included as a special character, with his specialty listed as being the ability to &quot;quench one&#x27;s thirst.&quot; He does not appear in any other version or sequel. 

In 1999, KID developed a video game for the PlayStation entitled &quot;Pepsiman&quot;. As the titular character, the player runs &quot;on rails&quot; (forced motion on a scrolling linear path), skateboards, rolls, and stumbles through various areas, avoiding dangers and collecting cans of Pepsi, all while trying to reach a thirsty person as in the commercials. Despite largely being considered a financial failure, Pepsiman has developed a cult following due to its over the top and nonsensical premise.

==Sports sponsorships==
Pepsi has official sponsorship deals with the National Football League, National Hockey League, and National Basketball Association. In 2007, and from 2013 to 2022, Pepsi sponsored the NFL&#x27;s Super Bowl halftime shows. It was the sponsor of Major League Soccer until December 2015 and Major League Baseball until April 2017, both leagues signing deals with Coca-Cola. From 1999 to 2020, Pepsi also had the naming rights to the Pepsi Center, an indoor sports and entertainment facility in Denver, Colorado, until the venue&#x27;s new naming rights were announced on October 22, 2020. 

In 1997, after his sponsorship with Coca-Cola ended, retired NASCAR Cup Series driver Jeff Gordon signed a long-term contract with Pepsi, and he drove with the Pepsi logos on his car with various paint schemes for about 2 races each year, usually a darker paint scheme during nighttime races. Pepsi has remained as one of his sponsors ever since. Pepsi has also sponsored the NFL Rookie of the Year award since 2002.

Pepsi has the first global sponsorship deals with the UEFA Champions League and the UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League starting in the 2015–16 season along with the sister brand, Pepsi Max and became the global sponsor of the competition.

Pepsi also has sponsorship deals in international cricket teams. The Pakistani national cricket team is one of the teams that the brand sponsors. The team wears the Pepsi logo on the front of their test and ODI test match clothing.

The Buffalo Bisons, an American Hockey League team, was sponsored by Pepsi-Cola in its later years; the team adopted the beverage&#x27;s red, white, and blue color scheme along with a modification of the Pepsi logo (with the word &quot;Buffalo&quot; in place of the Pepsi-Cola wordmark). The Bisons ceased operations in 1970, making way for the Buffalo Sabres of the NHL.

Pepsi also has been a sponsor of the Carolina Hurricanes of the National Hockey League since the team moved to North Carolina in 1997.

In 2017, Pepsi was the jersey sponsor of the Papua New Guinea national basketball team.

In the United States, Pepsi is made with carbonated water, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color, sugar, phosphoric acid, caffeine, citric acid, and natural flavors. A can of Pepsi (12 fl ounces) has 41 grams of carbohydrates (all from sugars), 30 mg of sodium, 0 grams of fat, 0 grams of protein, 38 mg of caffeine, and 150 calories. 

Pepsi has 10 more calories and two more grams of sugar and carbohydrates than Coca-Cola. Caffeine-Free Pepsi contains the same ingredients but without the caffeine.

Some regions, such as Sweden and the Netherlands have recently undergone a reduction of sugar in the standard variety, replacing it with the artificial sweeteners Acesulfame K and Sucralose. This change was done by PepsiCo Europe to slash the amount of sugar in all their drinks by 25% near the end of 2025. This formula change was expanded to the United Kingdom version (distributed by Britvic) in March 2023 (except where served in restaurants and bars). Currently, there are no plans for this formula to be introduced in North America.

==Variants==
===Fictional drinks===
Pepsi Perfect: A vitamin-enriched Pepsi variation in special bottle shown in the movie &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; in scenes set in the year 2015. This was later released as a limited-edition drink. Only 6,500 bottles were available for $20.15, they have since been sold for hundreds of dollars on eBay.

<text>Paul Johann Anselm [[Ritter]] von Feuerbach (14 November 177529 May 1833) was a German legal scholar. His major achievement was a reform of the Bavarian penal code which led to the abolition of torture and became a model for several other countries. He is also well known for his research on Kaspar Hauser, who died the same year as Feuerbach.

==Biography==
He was born in Hainichen, near Jena. He received his early education at Frankfurt on Main, where his family had moved soon after his birth. At the age of sixteen, however, he ran away from home, and, going to Jena, was helped by relations there to study at the university. In spite of poor health and the most desperate poverty, he made rapid progress. He attended the lectures of Karl Leonhard Reinhold and Gottlieb Hufeland, and soon published some literary essays of more than ordinary merit.

In 1795, he took the degree of doctor of philosophy, and in the same year, though possessing little money, he married. It was this step which led him to success and fame, by forcing him to turn from his favourite studies of philosophy and history to that of law, which was repugnant to him, but which offered a prospect of more rapid advancement.

At 23, he came into prominence by a vigorous criticism of Thomas Hobbes&#x27; theory on civil power. Soon afterwards, in lectures on criminal jurisprudence he set forth his famous theory, that in administering justice judges should be strictly limited in their decisions by the penal code. This new doctrine gave rise to a party called Rigorists, who supported his theory.
Von Feuerbach was the originator of the famous maxim &quot;nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali&quot;: &quot;There is no crime and hence there shall not be punishment if at the time no penal law existed&quot;.

In 1801, Feuerbach was appointed extraordinary professor of law without salary, at the University of Jena, and in the following year accepted a chair at Kiel, where he remained two years.

His chief work was the framing of a penal code for Bavaria. In 1804, he had moved from the University of Kiel to the University of Landshut, but, on being commanded by King Maximilian Joseph to draft a penal code for Bavaria (&quot;Strafgesetzbuch für das Königreich Bayern&quot;), in 1805 he moved to Munich where he was given a high appointment in the Ministry of Justice and was ennobled in 1808. The practical reform of penal legislation in Bavaria was begun under his influence in 1806 by the abolition of torture.

Out of his practical experience in the Ministry of Justice, with evaluating death penalties by Bavarian courts for royal pardon, he published the most notable cases 1808/11 in &quot;Merkwürdige Criminalfälle&quot; and 1828/29 a much enlarged collection &quot;Aktenmäßige Darstellung merkwürdiger Verbrechen&quot; (Notable crimes presented according to the court records). With this legal handbook of criminal cases in the tradition of the famous &quot;Causes Célèbres&quot; of the French lawyer Gayot de Pitaval (1673–1743), Feuerbach intended to establish a modern criminal psychology (&quot;Seelenkunde&quot;) for crime investigation, criminal judges, etc.

In the course of time, his work has been misinterpreted merely as a literary collection of fictional sensational crimes, and many of his court cases have been edited and published as trivial popular crime stories. However, Gerold Schmidt has found that Feuerbach recorded true historical events at true localities and persons with their real names and that, therefore, his work is a rich historical source for Bavarian local and social history, mentality, biography, etc.

In his &quot;Betrachtungen über das Geschworenengericht&quot; of 1811, Feuerbach declared against trial by jury, maintaining that the verdict of a jury was not adequate legal proof of a crime. Much controversy was aroused on the subject, and the author&#x27;s view was subsequently to some extent modified.

The result of his labours on the Bavarian penal code was promulgated in 1813. The influence of this code, the embodiment of Feuerbach&#x27;s enlightened views, was immense. It was at once made the basis for new codes in Württemberg and Saxe-Weimar; it was adopted in its entirety in the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg; and it was translated into Swedish by order of the king. Several of the Swiss cantons reformed their codes in conformity with it.

Feuerbach had also undertaken to prepare a civil code for Bavaria, to be founded on the Code Napoléon. This was afterwards set aside, and the Codex Maximilianus adopted as a basis. The project did not become law.

During the war of liberation (1813–1814), Feuerbach showed himself an ardent patriot, and published several political brochures. In 1814, Feuerbach was appointed second president of the court of appeal at Bamberg, and three years later he became first president of the court of appeal at Ansbach. In 1821 he was deputed by the government to visit France, Belgium, and the Rhine provinces for the purpose of investigating their juridical institutions. As the fruit of this visit, he published his treatises &quot;Betrachtungen über Öffentlichkeit und Mündigkeit der Gerechtigkeitspflege&quot; (1821) and &quot;Über die Gerichtsverfassung und das gerichtliche Verfahren Frankreichs&quot; (1825). In these he pleaded unconditionally for publicity in all legal proceedings.

In his later years, he took a deep interest in the fate of the strange foundling Kaspar Hauser, who had excited much attention in Europe. He was the first to publish a critical summary of the ascertained facts, under the title &quot;Kaspar Hauser, ein Beispiel eines Verbrechens am Seelenleben&quot; (1832).

Feuerbach died on 29 May 1833 in Frankfurt. There is some controversy over the cause and circumstances of his death, which remain largely unclear; his family, as well as he himself, shortly before his death, believed that he had been poisoned due to his protection of and research work on Kaspar Hauser, who himself died later the same year under suspicious circumstances.

==Family==
Feuerbach had five sons and three daughters: Joseph Anselm Feuerbach (1798–1851), Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach (1800–1834), Eduard August Feuerbach (1803-1843), Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach (1804–1872), Heinrich Friedrich Feuerbach (1806–1880), Rebecca Magdalena (1808–1891), Leonore Feuerbach (1809-1885), and Elise Feuerbach (1813–1883).
