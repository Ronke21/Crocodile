<text>Rhineland-Palatinate ( , ; ; ; ) is a western state of Germany. It covers and has about 4.05 million residents. It is the ninth largest and sixth most populous of the sixteen states. Mainz is the capital and largest city. Other cities are Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Koblenz, Trier, Kaiserslautern, Worms, and Neuwied. It is bordered by North Rhine-Westphalia, Saarland, Baden-Württemberg and Hesse and by France, Luxembourg and Belgium.

Rhineland-Palatinate was established in 1946 after World War II, from parts of the former states of Prussia (part of its Rhineland and Nassau provinces), Hesse (Rhenish Hesse) and Bavaria (its former outlying Palatinate kreis or district), by the French military administration in Allied-occupied Germany. Rhineland-Palatinate became part of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949 and shared the country&#x27;s only border with the Saar Protectorate until the latter was returned to German control in 1957. Rhineland-Palatinate&#x27;s natural and cultural heritage includes the extensive Palatinate winegrowing region, picturesque landscapes, and many castles and palaces.

Rhineland-Palatinate is currently the only federal state in Germany where nuclear weapons are stored extraterritorially under the responsibility and supervision of US forces.

Several German-American ethnicities originated from this state, such as the Pennsylvania Dutch, Maryland Palatines, Ohio Rhinelanders, and Missouri Rhinelanders.

==History==
The state of Rhineland-Palatinate was founded shortly after the Second World War, on 30 August 1946. It was formed mainly from the southern part of the Prussian Rhine Province (the of Koblenz and Trier), from Rhenish Hesse, from the western part of Nassau and the Bavarian Rhenish Palatinate minus the county of Saarpfalz. The Joint German-Luxembourg Sovereign Region () is the only unincorporated area of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. This condominium is formed by the rivers Moselle, Sauer, and Our, where they run along the border between Luxembourg and Rhineland-Palatinate or the Saarland. The region has a vast history, from the control of the Franks, to the control of the Holy Roman Empire, and saw fighting during the First and Second World Wars.

=== Emergence ===
The present state of Rhineland-Palatinate formed part of the French Zone of Occupation (1945–1949) after the Second World War. It comprised the former Bavarian Palatinate, the (&quot;government districts&quot;) of Koblenz and Trier (which formed the southern part of the Prussian Rhine Province), the parts of the Province of Rhenish Hesse () west of the River Rhine and belonged to the People&#x27;s State of Hesse (), parts of the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau (Montabaur), and the former Oldenburg region around Birkenfeld (Principality of Birkenfeld).

On 10 July 1945, the occupation authority on the soil of the present-day Rhineland-Palatinate transferred from the Americans to the French. To begin with, the French divided the region provisionally into two &quot;upper presidiums&quot; (), Rhineland-Hesse-Nassau (for the hitherto Prussian government districts and regions of Koblenz, Trier, and Montabaur) and Hesse-Palatinate (for the hitherto Bavarian Palatinate and old Hessian-Darmstadt province of Rhenish Hesse). The formation of the state was ordained on 30 August 1946, the last state in the Western Zone of Occupation to be established, by Regulation No. 57 of the French military government under General Marie-Pierre Kœnig. It was initially called Rhenish-Palatinate ( or ); the name Rhineland-Palatinate () was first confirmed in the constitution of 18 May 1947.

The provisional French government at that time wanted originally to leave the option open of annexing further areas west of the Rhine after the Saarland was turned into a protectorate. When the Americans and British, however had led the way with the establishment of German states, the French came under increasing pressure and eventually followed their example by setting up the states of Baden, Württemberg-Hohenzollern, and Rhineland-Palatinate. However the French military government forbade the Saarland from joining Rhineland-Palatinate. Mainz was named as the state capital in the regulation; the &quot;Mixed Commission&quot; (), named as the highest organ of state charged with the administration of the new state and with the preparation of an advisory state assembly, started its work in Mainz. However war damage and destruction meant that Mainz did not have enough administrative buildings, so the headquarters of the state government and parliament was provisionally established in Koblenz. On 22 November 1946, the constituent meeting of the Advisory State Assembly () took place there, and a draft constitution was drawn up. Previously, local elections had been held. Wilhelm Boden was (after a short term of office as the of Rhineland-Hesse-Nassau) nominated on 2 December as the minister president of the new state by the French military government.

=== Early years ===
Adolf Süsterhenn submitted to the Advisory State Assembly a draft constitution, which was passed after several rounds of negotiation on 25 April 1947 in a final vote, with the absolute majority of the CDU voting for and the SPD and KPD voting against. A point of contention involved the draft constitution providing for separate schools based on Christian denomination. On 18 May 1947, 53% of the electorate adopted the Constitution for Rhineland-Palatinate in a referendum. While the Catholic north and west of the new state adopted the constitution by a majority, the majority in Rhenish Hesse and the Palatinate voted against it. On the same date the first elections took place for the state parliament, the Landtag of Rhineland-Palatinate. The inaugural assembly of parliament took place on 4 June 1947 in the large city hall at Koblenz. Wilhelm Boden was elected the first minister-president of Rhineland-Palatinate. Just one month later, Peter Altmeier succeeded him.

The constitutional bodies – the Government (), the Parliament () and the Constitutional Court () – established their provisional seat in Koblenz. In the following period, Koblenz and Mainz each emphasized their suitability as the state capital in a public debate. From the beginning, Minister-President Altmeier pressed for Mainz as the capital because he knew that the south of the country, especially the Palatinate, would not accept Koblenz, which was far to the north and formerly Prussian. On 16 May 1950, the decided to relocate itself and the from Koblenz to Mainz.
After the government and parliament moved to Mainz, many state authorities and courts remained in Koblenz, including the Constitutional Court and the State Archives. In addition, the German Federal Archives and Federal Office of Hydrology were established in Koblenz in 1952.

=== Consolidation ===
A sense of community developed only very gradually in the &quot;land of the retort&quot;, which had been established largely without regard to the historical affiliations of its inhabitants. It was given little chance of survival, especially as it had very few large industrial centres. However, the establishment of numerous military bases, both Allied and , helped to some extent to boost the economy. In 1956, under Article 29 of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, petitions were made in the regions of Koblenz, Trier, Montabaur, Rhenish Hesse, and Palatinate for their separation from the state and incorporation into the respective states of North Rhine-Westphalia, Hesse, Bavaria, and Baden-Württemberg. All petitions for a referendum except those in the administrative district of Palatinate won the necessary majority; however, almost 20 years passed before the referendums finally took place. On 19 January 1975, none of the regions concerned returned a majority for being transferred to another state. This put an end to decades of discussion. Only the AKK conflict, a dispute over the districts of Mainz-Amöneburg, Mainz-Kastel, and Mainz-Kostheim, has continued to exercise politicians up to the present day.

==Geography==

Rhineland-Palatinate shares international borders with France (Grand Est), Luxembourg (Clervaux, Diekirch, Echternach, Grevenmacher, Remich, and Vianden), and Belgium (Wallonia). Within Germany, its neighbours are Baden-Württemberg, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, and the Saarland. It is the ninth-largest state by area. Rhineland-Palatinate is part of the SaarLorLux euregion.

With 42% of its area covered by forests, it is the most forested state along with Hesse. The state&#x27;s major rivers are the Rhine, including the UNESCO World Heritage Site Middle Rhine, and the Moselle. Several crater lakes of volcanic origin are in the Eifel, the largest of which is the Laacher See.

Climatically, Rhineland-Palatinate can be divided into two areas:
The Rhenish Massif with a typically humid continental climate (Dfb). Summers here are usually warm with much precipitation and winters tend to be dry and cold. Snowfall is a common occasion.

The deep Valleys of Rhine and Moselle with an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Cfb&quot;). Summers are hot and moist, while winters are cool. Freezing temperatures are rare and snow usually melts within hours. The mild climate allows palm trees, fig trees, stone pines, oleander shrubs, olive trees, almond trees and other exotic plants to be grown in this area.

The forests in this region are home to common pests such as &quot;Melolontha Hippocastrani&quot;, that cause damage to the foliage and soil.

The Rhenish Massif forms roughly the northern half of the state, including the regions Eifel, Moselle Valley, Hunsrück, Westerwald, and parts of the Taunus. The Palatinate forms the biggest part of the southern half along with Rhenish Hesse. The Nahe Valley separates both parts.

==Politics==
==Administration==
Rhineland-Palatinate is divided into 24 districts (&quot;Landkreise&quot;), 12 independent cities (&quot;Kreisfreie Städte&quot;).

The gross domestic product (GDP) of the state was 147.0 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 4.4% of German economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 33,100 euros or 110% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 102% of the EU average.

===Industry===
Rhineland-Palatinate leads all German states with an export rate around 50%. Important sectors are the winegrowing, chemical, pharmaceutical, and auto parts industries. &quot;Distinctive regional industries&quot; includes gemstones, ceramics and glass, and leather. Small and medium enterprises are considered the &quot;backbone&quot; of the economy in Rhineland-Palatinate. The principal employer is the chemical and plastics processing industry, which is represented by BASF in Ludwigshafen. Boehringer, BioNTech, Joh. A. Benckiser, SGE Deutsche Holding, and Schott Glassworks conclude the top five companies in the state.

===Agriculture and viticulture===
Rhineland-Palatinate is Germany&#x27;s leading producer of wine in terms of grape cultivation and wine export. Its capital, Mainz, may be called the capital of the German wine industry, being the home of the German Wine Institute, the German Wine Fund in the {{lang|de|Haus des Deutschen Weines}} (House of German Wine), and the {{lang|de|Verband Deutscher Prädikatsweingüter}} (VDP) Wine Bourse, which brings together the top winemakers of Germany and the wine merchants of the world.

Of 13 wine regions producing quality wine in Germany, six ({{lang|de|Rheinhessen, Pfalz, Mosel, Nahe, Mittelrhein}}, and {{lang|de|Ahr}}) are located in Rhineland-Palatinate, with 65 to 70% of the production of wine grapes in Germany having their origin within the state. About 13,000 wine producers generate 80 to 90% of the German wine export. The total estimated production from the six Rhineland-Palatinate regions was nearly 7 million hectoliters in 2018.

Traditional grape varieties and a wide range of varieties developed during the last 125 years are characteristic for the region.

Classical white varieties are cultivated at {{convert|63683|ha|acre}}. These comprise the famous Rieslings {{convert|14446|ha|acre}}, {{lang|de|Müller-Thurgau}} ({{convert|8663|ha|acre}}), {{lang|de|Silvaner}} ({{convert|3701|ha|acre}}), and {{lang|de|Kerner}} ({{convert|3399|ha|acre}}).

The share of red varieties grew constantly during the last decades and amounts to {{convert|20000|ha|acre}}. {{lang|de|Dornfelder}}, a recent cultivar, is the leading red grape cultivated on {{convert|7626|ha|acre}}, which is more than a third. {{lang|de|Blauer Portugieser}} ({{convert|4446|ha|acre}}) and {{lang|de|Spätburgunder}} ({{convert|3867|ha|acre}}) show also appreciable cultivated shares.

In addition, {{lang|fr|Pinot blanc}}, {{lang|fr|Pinot gris}}, Chardonnay as white varieties and Regent and St. Laurent as red varieties have been increasing their share, as the growing conditions improve in Rhineland-Palatinate.

The state supports the wine industry by providing a comprehensive consultancy and education program in the service supply centers ({{langx|de|DLR|links=no}}) of the land. The Geilweilerhof Institute for Grape Breeding is fully financed by the state. Many well-known new varieties such as {{lang|de|Morio-Muskat}}, Bacchus, Optima, and Regent have been created in these institutes.

The worldwide leader in sparkling wine production, producing 224,4 million bottles in 2017/18, is the renowned {{lang|de|Schloss Wachenheim}} Group. This company is headquartered in Trier, with operations in several locations in Rhineland-Palatinate and three sites in France (Compagnie Française des Grands Vins (CFGV)).

Other renowned sparkling wine producers such as {{lang|de|Kupferberg}}, {{lang|de|Deinhard}}, and {{lang|de|Henkell}} also had their roots in the region, but now belong to companies outside the state as a result of business consolidation.

=== Unemployment ===
The unemployment rate stood at 4.1% in October 2018 and was lower than the German average.

<doc id="26240" wikidata="Q112707" url="?curid=26240" title="House of Romanov">
<text>The House of Romanov (also transliterated as Romanoff; , ) was the reigning imperial house of Russia from 1613 to 1917. They achieved prominence after Anastasia Romanovna married Ivan the Terrible, the first crowned tsar of all Russia. Nicholas II, the last Emperor of Russia, and his immediate family were executed in 1918, but there are still living descendants of other members of the imperial house.

The house consisted of boyars in Russia (the highest rank in the Russian nobility at the time) under the reigning Rurik dynasty, which became extinct upon the death of Feodor I in 1598. The Time of Troubles, caused by the resulting succession crisis, saw several pretenders and imposters lay claim to the Russian throne during the Polish-Lithuanian occupation. On 21 February 1613, the Zemsky Sobor elected Michael Romanov as tsar, establishing the Romanovs as Russia&#x27;s second reigning dynasty.

Michael&#x27;s grandson, Peter I, who took the title of emperor and proclaimed the Russian Empire in 1721, transformed the country into a great power through a series of wars and reforms. The direct male line of the Romanovs ended when Elizabeth died childless in 1762. As a result, her nephew Peter III, an agnatic member of the House of Holstein-Gottorp (a cadet branch of the German House of Oldenburg that reigned in Denmark), ascended to the throne and adopted his Romanov mother&#x27;s house name. Officially known as members of the House of Romanov, descendants after Elizabeth are sometimes referred to as &quot;Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov&quot;.

Paul I became the first heir to the throne, having the title &quot;tsesarevich&quot;, which was subsequently used for all main heirs.

The abdication of Nicholas II on as a result of the February Revolution ended 304 years of Romanov rule and led to the establishment of the Russian Republic under the Russian Provisional Government in the lead-up to the Russian Civil War of 1917–1922. In 1918, the Bolsheviks executed Nicholas II and his family. Of the House of Romanov&#x27;s 65 members, 47 survivors went into exile abroad. In 1924, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, the senior surviving male-line descendant of Alexander II of Russia by primogeniture, claimed the headship of the defunct Imperial House of Russia.

==Surname usage==
Legally, it remains unclear whether any &quot;ukase&quot; ever abolished the surname of Michael Romanov (or of his subsequent male-line descendants) after his accession to the Russian throne in 1613, although by tradition members of reigning dynasties seldom use surnames, being known instead by dynastic titles (&quot;Tsarevich Ivan Alexeevich&quot;, &quot;Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich&quot;, etc.). From , the monarchs of the Russian Empire claimed the throne as relatives of Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia (1708–1728), who had married Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. Thus they were no longer Romanovs by patrilineage, belonging instead to the Holstein-Gottorp cadet branch of the German House of Oldenburg that reigned in Denmark. The 1944 edition of the &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot; records the name of Russia&#x27;s ruling dynasty from the time of Peter III (reigned 1761–1762) as &quot;Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov&quot;. However, the terms &quot;Romanov&quot; and &quot;House of Romanov&quot; often occurred in official references to the Russian imperial family. The coat-of-arms of the Romanov boyars was included in legislation on the imperial dynasty,
and in a 1913 jubilee, Russia officially celebrated the &quot;300th Anniversary of the Romanovs&#x27; rule&quot;.

After the February Revolution of 1917, a special decree of the Provisional Government of Russia granted all members of the imperial family the surname &quot;Romanov&quot;. The only exceptions, the morganatic descendants of the Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich (1891–1942), took (in exile) the surname Ilyinsky.

==History==
===Origins===
The Romanovs share their origin with two dozen other Russian noble families. Their earliest common ancestor is one Andrei Kobyla, attested around 1347 as a boyar in the service of Simeon, the prince of Moscow and grand prince of Vladimir. Later generations assigned to Kobyla an illustrious pedigree. An 18th-century genealogy claimed that he was the son of the Old Prussian prince Glanda Kambila, who came to Russia in the second half of the 13th century, fleeing the invading Germans. Indeed, one of the leaders of the Old Prussian rebellion of 1260–1274 against the Teutonic order was named Glande. This legendary version of the Romanov&#x27;s origin is contested by another version of descent from a boyar family from Novgorod.

His actual origin may have been less spectacular. Not only is &quot;Kobyla&quot; Russian for &quot;mare&quot;, some of his relatives also had as nicknames the terms for horses and other domestic animals, thus suggesting descent from one of the royal equerries. One of Kobyla&#x27;s sons, Feodor, a member of the boyar duma of Dmitry Donskoy, was nicknamed Koshka (&quot;cat&quot;). His descendants took the surname Koshkin, then changed it to Zakharin (descendants of Zakhary), which later split into two branches: Zakharin-Yakovlev (descendants of Yakov Zakharyevich) and Zakharin-Yuriev (descendants of Yuri Zakharyevich). During the reign of Ivan the Terrible, the former became known as Yakovlev (Alexander Herzen among them), whereas the grandchildren of Roman Yurievich Zakharyin-Yuriev changed their name to &quot;Romanov&quot;.

Feodor Nikitich Romanov was descended from the Rurik dynasty through the female line. His mother, Evdokiya Gorbataya-Shuyskaya, was a Rurikid princess from the Shuysky branch, daughter of Alexander Gorbatyi-Shuisky. A ninth generation ancestor of Michael I Romanov is Dimitri Konstantinovich.

===Rise to power===
The family fortunes soared when Roman&#x27;s daughter, Anastasia Zakharyina, married Ivan IV (&quot;the Terrible&quot;) on 3 (13) February 1547. Since her husband had assumed the title of Tsar of all Russia, which derives from the title &quot;Caesar&quot;, on 16 January 1547, she was crowned as the first tsaritsa of Russia. Her mysterious death in 1560 changed Ivan&#x27;s character for the worse. Suspecting the boyars of having poisoned his beloved, Ivan launched a reign of terror against them. Among his children by Anastasia, the eldest, Ivan, was murdered by the tsar in a quarrel; the younger Feodor, a pious but lethargic prince, inherited the throne upon his father&#x27;s death in 1584.

Throughout Feodor&#x27;s reign (1584–1598), the tsar&#x27;s brother-in-law, Boris Godunov, and his Romanov cousins contested the &quot;de facto&quot; rule of Russia. Upon the childless death of Feodor, the 700-year-old line of the Rurik dynasty came to an end, ushering in the Time of Troubles. After a long struggle, the party of Boris Godunov prevailed over the Romanovs, and the &quot;Zemsky Sobor&quot; elected Godunov as tsar in 1598. Godunov&#x27;s revenge on the Romanovs led to all the family and its relations being deported to remote corners of the Russian North and Urals, where most of them died of hunger or in chains. The family&#x27;s leader, Feodor Nikitich Romanov, was exiled to the Antoniev Siysky Monastery and forced to take monastic vows with the name Filaret.

The Romanovs&#x27; fortunes again changed dramatically with the fall of the Godunov dynasty in June 1605. As a former leader of the anti-Godunov party and cousin of the last legitimate tsar, Filaret Romanov&#x27;s recognition was sought by several impostors who attempted to claim the Rurikid legacy and throne during the Time of Troubles. False Dmitriy I made him a metropolitan, and False Dmitriy II raised him to the dignity of patriarch. Upon the expulsion of the Polish army from Moscow in 1612, the &quot;Zemsky Sobor&quot; offered the Russian crown to several Rurikid and Gediminian princes, but all declined the honour.

On being offered the Russian crown, Filaret&#x27;s 16-year-old son Mikhail Romanov, then living at the Ipatiev Monastery of Kostroma, burst into tears of fear and despair. He was finally persuaded to accept the throne by his mother Kseniya Ivanovna Shestova, who blessed him with the holy image of Our Lady of St. Theodore. Feeling how insecure his throne was, Mikhail attempted to emphasize his ties with the last Rurikid tsars and sought advice from the &quot;Zemsky Sobor&quot; on every important issue. This strategy proved successful. The early Romanovs were generally accepted by the population as in-laws of Ivan the Terrible and viewed as innocent martyrs of Godunov&#x27;s wrath.

== Dynastic crisis ==
Mikhail was succeeded by his only son Alexei, who steered the country quietly through numerous troubles. Upon Alexei&#x27;s death, there was a period of dynastic struggle between his children by his first wife Maria Ilyinichna Miloslavskaya (Feodor III, Sofia Alexeyevna, Ivan V) and his son by his second wife Nataliya Kyrillovna Naryshkina, the future Peter the Great. Peter ruled from 1682 until his death in 1725. In numerous successful wars he expanded the tsardom into a huge empire that became a major European power. He led a cultural revolution that replaced some of the traditionalist and medieval social and political system with a modern, scientific, Europe-oriented, and rationalist system.

New dynastic struggles followed the death of Peter. His only son to survive into adulthood, Tsarevich Alexei, did not support Peter&#x27;s modernization of Russia. He had previously been arrested and died in prison shortly thereafter. Near the end of his life, Peter managed to alter the succession tradition of male heirs, allowing him to choose his heir. Power then passed into the hands of his second wife, Empress Catherine, who ruled until her death in 1727. Peter II, the son of Tsarevich Alexei, took the throne but died in 1730, ending the Romanov male line. He was succeeded by Anna I, daughter of Peter the Great&#x27;s half-brother and co-ruler, Ivan V. Before she died in 1740 the empress declared that her grandnephew, Ivan VI, should succeed her. This was an attempt to secure the line of her father, while excluding descendants of Peter the Great from inheriting the throne. Ivan VI was only a one-year-old infant at the time of his succession to the throne, and his parents, Grand Duchess Anna Leopoldovna and Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick, the ruling regent, were detested for their German counselors and relations. As a consequence, shortly after Empress Anna&#x27;s death, Elizabeth Petrovna, a legitimized daughter of Peter I, managed to gain the favor of the populace and dethroned Ivan VI in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, supported by the Preobrazhensky Regiment and the ambassadors of France and Sweden. Ivan VI was murdered in 1764 while imprisoned, and his parents died from illness during their captivity.

===Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov===

The Holstein-Gottorps of Russia retained the Romanov surname, emphasizing their matrilineal descent from Peter the Great, through Anna Petrovna (Peter I&#x27;s elder daughter by his second wife). In 1742, Empress Elizabeth of Russia brought Anna&#x27;s son, her nephew Peter of Holstein-Gottorp, to St. Petersburg and proclaimed him her heir. In time, she married him off to a German princess, Sophia of Anhalt-Zerbst. In 1762, shortly after the death of Empress Elizabeth, Sophia, who had taken the Russian name Catherine upon her marriage, overthrew her unpopular husband, with the aid of her lover, Grigory Orlov. She reigned as Catherine the Great. Catherine&#x27;s son, Paul I, who succeeded his mother in 1796, was particularly proud to be a great-grandson of Peter the Great, although his mother&#x27;s memoirs arguably insinuate that Paul&#x27;s natural father was, in fact, her lover Sergei Saltykov, rather than her husband, Peter. Painfully aware of the hazards resulting from battles of succession, Paul decreed house laws for the Romanovs – the so-called Pauline Laws, among the strictest in Europe – which established semi-Salic primogeniture as the rule of succession to the throne, requiring Orthodox faith for the monarch and dynasts, and for the consorts of the monarchs and their near heirs. Later, Alexander I, responding to the 1820 morganatic marriage of his brother and heir, added the requirement that consorts of all Russian dynasts in the male line had to be of equal birth (i.e., born to a royal or sovereign dynasty).

===Age of Autocracy===
Paul I was murdered in his palace in Saint Petersburg in 1801. Alexander I, succeeded him on the throne and later died without leaving a son. His brother, crowned Nicholas I, succeeded him on the throne in 1825. The succession was far from smooth, however, as hundreds of troops took the oath of allegiance to Nicholas&#x27;s elder brother, Constantine Pavlovich who, unbeknownst to them, had renounced his claim to the throne in 1822, following his marriage. The confusion, combined with opposition to Nicholas&#x27; accession, led to the Decembrist revolt. Nicholas I fathered four sons, educating them for the prospect of ruling Russia and for military careers, from whom the last branches of the dynasty descended.

Alexander II, son of Nicholas I, became the next Russian emperor in 1855, in the midst of the Crimean War. While Alexander considered it his charge to maintain peace in Europe and Russia, he believed only a strong Russian military could keep the peace. By developing the Imperial Russian Army, giving increased autonomy to Finland, and freeing the serfs in 1861 he gained much popular support for his reign.

Despite his popularity, however, his family life began to unravel by the mid-1860s. In 1864, his eldest son, and heir, Tsarevich Nicholas, died suddenly. His wife, Empress Maria Alexandrovna, who suffered from tuberculosis, spent much of her time abroad. Alexander eventually turned to a mistress, Princess Catherine Dolgorukova. Immediately following the death of his wife in 1880 he contracted a morganatic marriage with Dolgorukova. His legitimization of their children, and rumors that he was contemplating crowning his new wife as empress, caused tension within the dynasty. In particular, the grand duchesses were scandalized at the prospect of deferring to a woman who had borne Alexander several children during his wife&#x27;s lifetime. Before Princess Catherine could be elevated in rank, however, on 13 March 1881 Alexander was assassinated by a hand-made bomb hurled by Ignacy Hryniewiecki. Slavic patriotism, cultural revival, and Panslavist ideas grew in importance in the latter half of this century, evoking expectations of a more Russian than cosmopolitan dynasty. Several marriages were contracted with members of other reigning Slavic or Orthodox dynasties (Greece, Montenegro, Serbia). In the early 20th century two Romanov princesses were allowed to marry Russian high noblemen – whereas, until the 1850s, practically all marriages had been with German princelings.

His son Alexander III succeeded Alexander II. This tsar, the second-to-last Romanov emperor, was responsible for conservative reforms in Russia. Not expected to inherit the throne, he was educated in matters of state only after the death of his older brother, Nicholas. Lack of diplomatic training may have influenced his politics as well as those of his son, Nicholas II. Alexander III was physically impressive, being not only tall (1.93 m or 6&#x27;4&quot;, according to some sources), but of large physique and considerable strength. His beard hearkened back to the likeness of tsars of old, contributing to an aura of brusque authority, awe-inspiring to some, alienating to others. Alexander, fearful of the fate which had befallen his father, strengthened autocratic rule in Russia. Some of the reforms the more liberal Alexander II had pushed through were reversed.

Alexander had inherited not only his dead brother&#x27;s position as &quot;Tsesarevich&quot;, but also his brother&#x27;s Danish fiancée, Princess Dagmar. Taking the name Maria Feodorovna upon her conversion to Orthodoxy, she was the daughter of King Christian IX of Denmark and the sister of the future kings Frederik VIII and George I of Greece, as well as of Britain&#x27;s Queen Alexandra, consort of Edward VII. Despite contrasting natures and backgrounds, the marriage was considered harmonious, producing six children and acquiring for Alexander the reputation of being the first tsar not known to take mistresses.

His eldest son, Nicholas, became emperor upon Alexander III&#x27;s death due to kidney disease at age 49 in November 1894. Nicholas reputedly said, &quot;I am not ready to be tsar...&quot; Just a week after the funeral, Nicholas married his fiancée, Alix of Hesse-Darmstadt, a favorite grandchild of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Though a kind-hearted man, he tended to leave intact his father&#x27;s harsh policies. For her part the shy Alix, who took the name Alexandra Feodorovna, became a devout convert to Orthodoxy as well as a devoted wife to Nicholas and mother to their five children, yet avoided many of the social duties traditional for Russia&#x27;s tsarinas. Seen as distant and severe, unfavorable comparisons were drawn between her and her popular mother-in-law, Maria Fyodorovna. When, in September 1915, Nicholas took command of the army at the front lines during World War I, Alexandra sought to influence him toward an authoritarian approach in government affairs even more than she had done during peacetime. His well-known devotion to her injured both his and the dynasty&#x27;s reputation during World War I, due to both her German origin and her unique relationship with Rasputin, whose role in the life of her only son was not widely known. Alexandra was a carrier of the gene for haemophilia, inherited from her maternal grandmother, Queen Victoria. Her son, Alexei, the long-awaited heir to the throne, inherited the disease and suffered agonizing bouts of protracted bleeding, the pain of which was sometimes partially alleviated by Rasputin&#x27;s ministrations. Nicholas and Alexandra also had four daughters: the Grand Duchesses Olga, Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia.

The six crowned representatives of the Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov line were: Paul (1796–1801), Alexander I (1801–1825), Nicholas I (1825–1855), Alexander II (1855–1881), Alexander III (1881–1894), and Nicholas II (1894–1917).

Constantine Pavlovich and Michael Alexandrovich, both morganatically married, are occasionally counted among Russia&#x27;s emperors by historians who observe that the Russian monarchy did not legally permit interregnums. Yet neither was crowned; Constantine renounced the throne before his brother&#x27;s death, and Michael deferred his acceptance of the throne, effectively ending the monarchy.

===Downfall===
The February Revolution of 1917 resulted in the abdication of Nicholas II in favor of his brother Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich. The latter declined to accept imperial authority save to delegate it to the Provisional Government pending a future democratic referendum, effectively terminating the Romanov dynasty&#x27;s rule over Russia.

After the February Revolution, Nicholas II and his family were placed under house arrest in the Alexander Palace. While several members of the imperial family managed to stay on good terms with the Provisional Government and were eventually able to leave Russia, Nicholas II and his family were sent into exile in the Siberian town of Tobolsk by Alexander Kerensky in August 1917. In the October Revolution of 1917 the Bolsheviks ousted the Provisional Government. In April 1918, the Romanovs were moved to the Russian town of Yekaterinburg, in the Urals, where they were placed in the Ipatiev House. Here, on the night of 16–17 July 1918, the entire Russian Imperial Romanov family, along with several of their retainers, were executed by Bolshevik revolutionaries, most likely on the orders of Vladimir Lenin.

===Executions===

Late on the night of 16 July, Nicholas, Alexandra, their five children and four servants were ordered to dress quickly and go down to the cellar of the house in which they were being held. There, the family and servants were arranged in two rows for a photograph they were told was being taken to quell rumors that they had escaped. Suddenly, a dozen armed men burst into the room and gunned down the imperial family in a hail of gunfire. Those who survived the shooting were stabbed to death.

The remains of Nicholas, Alexandra and three of their children were excavated in a forest near Yekaterinburg in 1991 and positively identified two years later using DNA analysis. The Crown Prince Alexei and one Romanov daughter were not accounted for, fueling the persistent legend that Anastasia, the youngest Romanov daughter, had survived the execution of her family. Of the several &quot;Anastasias&quot; that surfaced in Europe in the decade after the Russian Revolution, Anna Anderson, who died in the United States in 1984, was the most convincing. In 1994, however, scientists used DNA testing to prove that Anna Anderson was not the tsar&#x27;s daughter but a Polish woman named Franziska Schanzkowska.

Initially, gunmen shot at Nicholas who immediately fell dead as a result of multiple bullet wounds. Then the dark room where the family was held filled with smoke and dust from the spray of bullets. With limited visibility, the gunmen shot blindly, often hitting the ceiling and walls, creating more dust and debris. As a result of this many of the gunmen themselves were injured. Alexandra was soon shot in the head by military commissar Peter Ermakov and was killed. It was not until after the room had been cleared of smoke that the shooters re-entered to find the remaining imperial family still alive and uninjured. Maria attempted to escape through the doors at the rear of the room, leading to a storage area, but the doors were nailed shut. The noise produced as she rattled the doors attracted the attention of Ermakov. Some of the family were shot in the head, but several of the others, including the young and frail tsarevich, would not die either from multiple close-range bullet wounds or bayonet stabs. The gunmen then proceeded to shoot each family member once again. Even so, two of the daughters were still alive 10 minutes later, and were then bludgeoned to death with the butt of a rifle. Later it was discovered that the bullets and bayonet stabs had been partially blocked by diamonds sewn into the children&#x27;s clothing.

Following the murder of the Romanov family, the Bolsheviks made several attempts to dispose of the bodies. Initially the bodies were to be thrown down a mineshaft; however, the location of the disposal site was revealed to locals, causing them to change the location. Instead of a burial, the Bolsheviks decided to burn two of the corpses of the former royal family. Burning the corpses proved to be difficult as it took significant time, so the group resorted to disfiguring the pair with acid. In a rush, the Bolsheviks threw nine additional bodies into a grave and covered them with acid as well.

The bodies of the Romanovs were then hidden and moved several times before being interred in an unmarked pit where they remained until the summer of 1979 when amateur enthusiasts disinterred and re-buried some of them, and then decided to conceal the find until the fall of the USSR. In 1991 the grave site was excavated and the bodies were given a state funeral under the nascent democracy of post-Soviet Russia, and several years later DNA and other forensic evidence was used by Russian and international scientists to make accurate identifications.

The Ipatiev House has the same name as the Ipatiev Monastery in Kostroma, where Mikhail Romanov had been offered the Russian Crown in 1613. The large memorial church &quot;on the blood&quot; has been built on the spot where the Ipatiev House once stood.

Nicholas II and his family were proclaimed passion-bearers by the Russian Orthodox Church in 2000. In Orthodoxy, a passion-bearer is a saint who was not killed &quot;because&quot; of his faith, like a martyr; but who died &quot;in&quot; faith at the hand of murderers.

====Remains====

In the mid-1970s, Dr. Alexander Avdonin discovered the mass grave containing the remains of Nicholas II, Alexandra Feodorovna, and three of five Romanov children. The remains were found near Old Koptyaki road in Yekaterinburg, Russia. The grave contained 44 heavily degraded bone and tooth fragments. Avdonin released his discovery following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 prompting investigation by the Russian government.

The area where the remains were found was near the old Koptyaki Road, under what appeared to be double bonfire sites about 70 meters (230 ft) from the mass grave in Pigs Meadow near Yekaterinburg. The archaeologists stated that the bones were from a boy who approximately between the ages of 10 and 13 years at the time of his death and of a young woman who was between the ages of 18 and 23 years old. At the time, Anastasia was 17 years old while Maria was 19 years. Their brother Alexei was just a few weeks away from turning 14. Alexei&#x27;s elder sisters Olga and Tatiana were 22 and 21 years old at the time of the murder respectively. The bones were found using metal detectors and metal rods as probes. Also, striped material was found that appeared to have been from a blue-and-white striped cloth; Alexei commonly wore a blue-and-white striped undershirt.

In mid-2007, a Russian archaeologist announced a discovery by one of his workers. The excavation uncovered the following items in the two pits which formed a &quot;T&quot;:
* remains of 44 human bone fragments;
* bullet jackets from short barrel guns/pistols;
* wooden boxes which had deteriorated into fragments;
* pieces of ceramic which appear to be amphoras which were used as containers for acid;
* iron nails;
* iron angles;
* seven fragments of teeth;
* fragment of fabric of a garment.
Geneticists used a combination of autosomal STR and mtDNA sequencing to detect relationships between the family members&#x27; remains. Using a DNA sample from Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, a grand nephew of Alexandra, scientists matched his DNA to her and her children&#x27;s remains found in the mass grave. The investigation concluded that Alexei and one Romanov daughter were missing. Experts continue to debate which daughter was missing from the grave; those from the United States believe the missing child to be Anastasia, while those from Russia believe it to be Maria. However, &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; persisted throughout the 20th century, with some authors still contending that &quot;somehow the real Anastasia, Maria, or perhaps Aleksei, might have survived the Russian Revolution&quot; even after the discovery of the bodies and the confirmation of their identities was made public. Additionally, despite their discovery in 2007, the remains of the two bodies found in the separate grave did not &quot;receive a proper burial due to the Russian Orthodox Church&#x27;s unsubstantiated doubts about their authenticity.&quot;

As for Nicholas II, scientists used mtDNA heteroplasmy using samples from Princess Xenia Cheremeteff Sfiri and the Duke of Fife. In the early 1990s, considerable controversy surrounded the accuracy of mtDNA heteroplasmy for DNA testing particularly for distant relatives. In an attempt to refine the results of the investigation, Russian authorities exhumed the remains of Nicholas II&#x27;s brother, George Alexandrovich. George&#x27;s remains matched the heteroplasmy of the remains found in the grave, indicating that they did in fact belong to Tsar Nicholas II.

After the bodies were exhumed in June 1991, they remained in laboratories until 1998, while there was a debate as to whether they should be reburied in Yekaterinburg or St. Petersburg. A commission eventually chose St. Petersburg. The remains were transferred with full military honor guard and accompanied by members of the Romanov family from Yekaterinburg to St. Petersburg. In St. Petersburg remains of the imperial family were moved by a formal military honor guard cortege from the airport to St Petersburg&#x27;s Saints Peter and Paul Cathedral where they (along with several loyal servants who were killed with them) were interred in a special chapel near the tombs of their ancestors. At the cathedral, the remaining Romanov family hosted a formal funeral for Tsar Nicholas II attended by many relatives and representatives from nations worldwide.

====Other executions====
On 18 July 1918, the day after the killing at Yekaterinburg of the tsar and his family, members of the extended Russian imperial family were killed near Alapayevsk by Bolsheviks. They included: Grand Duke Sergei Mikhailovich of Russia, Prince Ioann Konstantinovich of Russia, Prince Konstantin Konstantinovich of Russia, Prince Igor Konstantinovich of Russia and Prince Vladimir Pavlovich Paley, Grand Duke Sergei&#x27;s secretary Varvara Yakovleva, and Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna, a granddaughter of Queen Victoria and elder sister of Tsarina Alexandra. Following the 1905 assassination of her husband, Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, Elisabeth Feodorovna had ceased living as a member of the Imperial family and took up life as a serving nun, but was nonetheless arrested and slated for death with other Romanovs. They were thrown down a mine shaft into which explosives were then dropped, all being left to die there slowly.
The bodies were recovered from the mine by the White Army in 1918, who arrived too late to rescue them. Their remains were placed in coffins and moved around Russia during struggles between the White and the opposing Red Army. By 1920, the coffins were interred in a former Russian mission in Beijing, now beneath a parking area. In 1981 Grand Duchess Elisabeth was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia, and in 1992 by the Moscow Patriarchate. In 2006, representatives of the Romanov family were making plans to re-inter the remains elsewhere. The town became a place of pilgrimage to the memory of Elisabeth Fyodorovna, whose remains were eventually re-interred in Jerusalem.

On 13 June 1918, Bolshevik revolutionary authorities killed Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia and Nicholas Johnson (Michael&#x27;s secretary) in Perm. Their bodies have never been found.

The exiled Grand Duke Nicholas Konstantinovich of Russia died on 26 January 1918, with some rumors claiming he was killed by the Bolsheviks. His morganatic son Prince Artemy Nikolayevich Romanovsky-Iskander was killed the following year in the Russian Civil War.

In January 1919, revolutionary authorities killed Grand Dukes Dmitry Konstantinovich, Nikolai Mikhailovich, Paul Alexandrovich and George Mikhailovich, who had been held in the prison of the Saint Peter and Paul Fortress in Petrograd. The four Grand Dukes were buried in a mass grave in the fortress, though Dmitry Konstantinovich&#x27;s body was collected by his former adjutant, rolled up in a rug and taken away for a private burial in the garden of a house in Petrograd, where he remains to this day.

===Exiles===

====Dowager Empress Maria Fyodorovna====
In 1919, Maria Feodorovna, widow of Alexander III, and mother of Nicholas II, managed to escape Russia aboard , which her nephew, King George V of the United Kingdom, had sent to rescue her, at the urging of his own mother, Queen Alexandra, who was Maria&#x27;s elder sister. After a stay in England with Queen Alexandra, she returned to her native Denmark, first living at Amalienborg Palace, with her nephew, King Christian X, and later, at Villa Hvidøre. Upon her death in 1928, her coffin was placed in the crypt of Roskilde Cathedral, the burial site of members of the Danish royal family.

In 2005, the coffin with her remains was moved to the Peter and Paul Fortress to be buried beside that of her husband. The transfer of her remains was accompanied by an elaborate ceremony at Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral officiated by Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow. Descendants and relatives of the Dowager Empress attended, including her great-grandson Prince Michael Andreevich, :Princess Catherine Ivanovna of Russia, the last living member of the Imperial Family born before the fall of the dynasty, and Prince Dmitri and Prince Nicholas Romanov.

====Other exiles====
Among the other exiles who managed to leave Russia were Maria Feodorovna&#x27;s two daughters, the Grand Duchesses Xenia Alexandrovna and Olga Alexandrovna, with their husbands, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and Nikolai Kulikovsky, respectively, and their children, as well as the spouses of Xenia&#x27;s elder two children and her granddaughter. Xenia remained in England, following her mother&#x27;s return to Denmark, although after their mother&#x27;s death Olga moved to Canada with her husband, both sisters dying in 1960. Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, widow of Nicholas II&#x27;s uncle, Grand Duke Vladimir, and her children the Grand Dukes Kiril, Boris and Andrei, and Kiril&#x27;s wife Victoria Melita and children, also managed to flee Russia. Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich, a cousin of Nicholas II, had been exiled to the Caucasus in 1916 for his part in the murder of Grigori Rasputin, and managed to escape Russia. Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaievich, who was supreme commander of Russian troops during World War I prior to Nicholas II taking command, along with his brother, Grand Duke Peter, and their wives, Grand Duchesses Anastasia and Militza, who were sisters, and Peter&#x27;s children, son-in-law, and granddaughter also fled the country.

Elizaveta Mavrikievna, widow of Konstantin Konstantinovich, escaped with her daughter Vera Konstantinovna and her son Georgii Konstantinovich, as well as her grandson Prince Vsevolod Ivanovich and her granddaughter Princess Catherine Ivanovna to Sweden. Her other daughter, Tatiana Konstantinovna, also escaped with her children Natasha and Teymuraz, as well as her uncle&#x27;s aide-de-camp Alexander Korochenzov. They fled to Romania and then Switzerland. Gavriil Konstantinovich was imprisoned before fleeing to Paris.

Ioann Konstantinovich&#x27;s wife, Elena Petrovna, was imprisoned in Alapayevsk and Perm, before escaping to Sweden and Nice, France.

Olga Constantinovna of Russia, Dowager Queen of Greece, who had returned to Russia in her widowhood, was able to escape to Switzerland with the help of the Danish embassy. Her daughter Maria Georgievna, wife of George Mikhailovich, had been vacationing in England with her daughters Nina and Xenia when the war broke out and chose not to return to Russia.

== Contemporary Romanovs ==
There have been numerous post-Revolution reports of Romanov survivors and unsubstantiated claims by individuals to be members of the deposed Tsar Nicholas II&#x27;s family, the best known of whom was Anna Anderson. Proven research has, however, confirmed that all of the Romanovs held prisoners inside the Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg were killed.

Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, a male-line grandson of Tsar Alexander II, claimed the headship of the deposed Imperial House of Russia, and assumed, as pretender, the title &quot;Emperor and Autocrat of all the Russias&quot; in 1924 when the evidence appeared conclusive that all Romanovs higher in the line of succession had been killed. Kirill was followed by his only son Vladimir Kirillovich, married to Princess Leonida Bagration of Mukhrani. Vladimir&#x27;s only child is Maria Vladimirovna (born 1953), who had one child in her marriage with Prince Franz Wilhelm of Prussia, George Mikhailovich. Since 1991, the succession to the former Russian throne has been in dispute, largely due to disagreements over the validity of dynasts&#x27; marriages. When Vladimir Kirillovich died on 21 April 1992, his daughter Maria claimed to succeed him as head of the Russian Imperial Family on the grounds that she was the only child of the last male dynast of the Imperial house according to the Romanovs&#x27; Pauline laws, which granted succession rights only to the offspring born out of equal unions with other reigning or mediatised houses. Since then, her son George Mikhailovich has contracted a morganatic marriage with the Italian citizen Rebecca Bettarini, leaving him and his mother as the last remaining members the Imperial House (according to their claims).

Others have argued in support of the rights of the late Prince Nicholas Romanov, whose brother Prince Dimitri Romanov was the next male heir of his branch after whom it was passed to Prince Andrew Romanov and then to his son Alexis Romanoff. All of them were born out of unequal marriages and are or were members of the Romanov Family Association formed in 1979, a private organization of most living male-line descendants of Emperor Paul I of Russia (other than Maria Vladimirovna and her son), publicly acknowledges that dynastic claims of family members should not be advanced, and is officially committed to support whichever form of government chosen by the Russian people.

Alternatively, Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen (a great-nephew of Vladimir Kirillovich through his sister, Maria) has been a claimant to the defunct Russian throne since 2013. He and his supporters argue that the marriage of Maria Vladimirovna&#x27;s parents was in contravention of the Pauline Laws. They maintain that the House of Bagration-Mukhrani did not possess sovereign status and was not recognized as equal by Nicholas II for the purpose of dynastic marriages at the time of the union of Princess Tatiana Constantinovna of Russia and Prince Constantine Bagration-Mukhransky in 1911, thirty seven years prior to that of Princess Leonida and Grand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich. Therefore, as the next of kin to Vladimir (in the exclusion of his daughter), the Russian Monarchist Party recognises Karl Emich as the heir to the Russian throne, since he and his wife converted on 1 June 2013, from Lutheranism to Eastern Orthodox Christianity, enabling his accession.

== Branches ==
Main article: Branches of the Russian Imperial Family

The Russian Imperial Family was split into four main branches named after the sons of Emperor Nicholas I:
* The Alexandrovichi (descendants of Emperor Alexander II of Russia) (with further subdivisions named The Vladimirovichi and The Pavlovichi after two of Alexander II&#x27;s younger sons)
* The Konstantinovichi (descendants of Grand Duke Constantine Nicholaevich of Russia)
* The Nikolaevichi (descendants of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia)
* The Mikhailovichi (descendants of Grand Duke Michael Nicolaevich of Russia)

== Romanov family jewelry ==

Most of the treasures are in the diamond fund of Russia and are the most expensive exhibits in museums. The collection of jewels and jewelry collected by the Romanov family during their reign are commonly referred to as the &quot;Russian Crown Jewels&quot; and they include official state regalia as well as personal pieces of jewelry worn by Romanov rulers and their family. After the Tsar was deposed and his family murdered, their jewels and jewelry became the property of the new Soviet government. A select number of pieces from the collection were sold at auction by Christie&#x27;s in London in March 1927. The remaining collection is on view today in the Kremlin Armoury in Moscow.

On 28 August 2009, a Swedish public news outlet reported that a collection of over 60 jewel-covered cigarette cases and cufflinks owned by Grand Duchess Vladimir had been found in the archives of the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and was returned to the descendants of Grand Duchess Vladimir. The jewelry was allegedly turned over to the Swedish embassy in St. Petersburg in November 1918 by Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin to keep it safe. The value of the jewelry has been estimated at 20 million Swedish krona (about 2.6 million US dollars).

<text>Robert Albert Bloch (; April 5, 1917September 23, 1994) was an American fiction writer, primarily of crime, psychological horror and fantasy, much of which has been dramatized for radio, cinema and television. He also wrote a relatively small amount of science fiction. His writing career lasted 60 years, including more than 30 years in television and film. He began his professional writing career immediately after graduation from high school, aged 17. Best known as the writer of &quot;Psycho&quot; (1959), the basis for the film of the same name by Alfred Hitchcock, Bloch wrote hundreds of short stories and over 30 novels. He was a protégé of H. P. Lovecraft, who was the first to seriously encourage his talent. However, while he started emulating Lovecraft and his brand of &quot;cosmic horror&quot;, he later specialized in crime and horror stories working with a more psychological approach.

Bloch was a contributor to pulp magazines such as &quot;Weird Tales&quot; in his early career, and was also a prolific screenwriter and a major contributor to science fiction fanzines and fandom in general.

He won the Hugo Award (for his story &quot;That Hell-Bound Train&quot;), the Bram Stoker Award, and the World Fantasy Award. He served a term as president of the Mystery Writers of America (1970) and was a member of that organization and of Science Fiction Writers of America, the Writers Guild of America, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Count Dracula Society. In 2008, The Library of America selected Bloch&#x27;s essay &quot;The Shambles of Ed Gein&quot; (1962) for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American true crime.

His favorites among his own novels were &quot;The Kidnapper&quot;, &quot;The Star Stalker&quot;, &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;Night-World,&quot; and &quot;Strange Eons&quot;. His work has been extensively adapted into films, television productions, comics, and audiobooks.

==Early life and education==
Bloch was born in Chicago, the son of Raphael &quot;Ray&quot; Bloch (1884–1952), a bank cashier, and his wife Stella Loeb (1880–1944), a social worker, both of German Jewish descent. Bloch&#x27;s family moved to Maywood, a Chicago suburb, when he was five; he lived there until he was ten. He attended the Methodist Church there, despite his parents&#x27; Jewish heritage, and studied at Emerson Grammar School. In 1925, at eight years of age, living in Maywood, he attended (alone at night) a screening of Lon Chaney, Sr.&#x27;s film &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1925). The scene of Chaney removing his mask terrified the young Bloch (&quot;it scared the living hell out of me and I ran all the way home to enjoy the first of about two years of recurrent nightmares&quot;). It also sparked his interest in horror. Bloch was a precocious child and found himself in fourth grade when he was eight. He also obtained a pass into the adult section of the public library, where he read omnivorously. Bloch considered himself a budding artist and worked in pencil sketching and watercolours, but myopia in adolescence seemed to effectively bar art as a career. He had passions for German-made lead toy soldiers and for silent cinema.

In 1929, Bloch&#x27;s father Ray Bloch lost his bank job, and the family moved to Milwaukee, where Stella worked at the Milwaukee Jewish Settlement settlement house. Robert attended Washington, then Lincoln High School, where he met lifelong friend Harold Gauer. Gauer was editor of &quot;The Quill&quot;, Lincoln&#x27;s literary magazine, and accepted Bloch&#x27;s first published short story, a horror story titled &quot;The Thing&quot; (the &quot;thing&quot; of the title was Death). Both Bloch and Gauer graduated from Lincoln in 1934 during the height of the Great Depression. Bloch was involved in the drama department at Lincoln and wrote and performed in school vaudeville skits.

==Career==
===&quot;Weird Tales&quot; magazine and the influence of H. P. Lovecraft===
During the 1930s, Bloch was an avid reader of the pulp magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, which he had discovered at the age of ten in 1927. In the Chicago Northwestern Railroad depot with his parents and aunt Lil, his aunt offered to buy him any magazine he wanted and he picked &quot;Weird Tales&quot; (Aug 1927 issue) off the newsstand over her shocked protest. He began his readings of the magazine with the first instalment of Otis Adelbert Kline&#x27;s &quot;The Bride of Osiris&quot; which dealt with a secret Egyptian city called Karneter located beneath Bloch&#x27;s birth city of Chicago. The Depression came in the early 1930s. He later recalled, in accepting the Lifetime Achievement Award at the First World Fantasy Convention (1975), how &quot;times were very hard. &quot;Weird Tales&quot; cost twenty-five cents in a day when most pulp magazines cost a dime. I remember that meant a lot to me.&quot; He went on to relate how he would get up very early on the last day of the month, with twenty-five cents saved from his monthly allowance of one dollar, and would run all the way to a combination tobacco/magazine store and buy the new &quot;Weird Tales&quot; issue, sometimes smuggling it home under his coat if the cover was particularly risqué. His parents were not impressed with Hugh Doak Rankin&#x27;s sexy covers for the magazine, and when the Bloch family moved to Milwaukee in 1928 young Bloch gradually abandoned his interest. But by the time he had entered high school, he returned to reading &quot;Weird Tales&quot; during convalescence from flu.

H. P. Lovecraft, a frequent contributor to &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, became one of his favorite writers. The first of Lovecraft&#x27;s stories he had read was &quot;Pickman&#x27;s Model&quot;, in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; for October 1927. Bloch wrote: &quot;In school I was forced to squirm my way through the works of Oliver Wendell Holmes, James Lowell and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In &#x27;Pickman&#x27;s Model&#x27;, the ghouls ate all three. Now that, I decided, was poetic justice.&quot; As a teenager, Bloch wrote a fan letter to Lovecraft (1933), asking where he could find copies of earlier stories of Lovecraft&#x27;s that Bloch had missed. Lovecraft lent them to him. Lovecraft also gave Bloch advice on his early fiction-writing efforts, asking whether Bloch had written any weird work and, if so, whether he might see samples of it. Bloch took up Lovecraft&#x27;s offer in late April 1933, sending him two short items, &quot;The Gallows&quot; and another work whose title is unknown.

Lovecraft also suggested Bloch write to other members of the Lovecraft Circle, including August Derleth, R. H. Barlow, Clark Ashton Smith, Donald Wandrei, Frank Belknap Long, Henry S. Whitehead, E. Hoffmann Price, Bernard Austin Dwyer and J. Vernon Shea. Bloch&#x27;s first completed tales were &quot;Lilies&quot;, &quot;The Laughter of a Young Ghoul&quot; and &quot;The Black Lotus&quot;. Bloch submitted these to &quot;Weird Tales&quot;; editor Farnsworth Wright summarily rejected them all. However Bloch successfully placed &quot;Lilies&quot; in the semi-professional magazine &quot;Marvel Tales&quot; (Winter 1934) and &quot;Black Lotus&quot; in &quot;Unusual Stories&quot; (1935). Bloch later commented, &quot;I figured I&#x27;d better do something different or I&#x27;d end up as a florist.&quot;

Bloch graduated from high school in June 1934. He then wrote a story which promptly (six weeks later) sold to &quot;Weird Tales.&quot; Bloch&#x27;s first publication in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; was a letter criticising the Conan stories of Robert E. Howard. His first professional sales, at the age of 17 (July 1934), to &quot;Weird Tales,&quot; were the short stories &quot;The Feast in the Abbey&quot; and &quot;The Secret in the Tomb&quot;. &quot;Feast ...&quot; appeared first, in the January 1935 issue, which actually went on sale November 1, 1934; &quot;The Secret in the Tomb&quot; appeared in the May 1935 &quot;Weird Tales&quot;.

Bloch&#x27;s correspondence with Derleth led to a visit to Derleth&#x27;s home in Sauk City, Wisconsin (the headquarters of Arkham House). Bloch was impressed by Derleth who &quot;fulfilled my expectations as a writer by wearing this purple velvet smoking jacket. That impressed me even more because Derleth didn&#x27;t even smoke.&quot; Following this, and continued correspondence with Lovecraft, Bloch went to Chicago and met Farnsworth Wright, the then editor of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;. He also met the first &quot;Weird Tales&quot; writer outside of Derleth he had encountered - Otto Binder.

Bloch&#x27;s early stories were strongly influenced by Lovecraft. Indeed, a number of his stories were set in, and extended, the world of Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos. These include &quot;The Dark Demon&quot;, in which the character Gordon is a figuration of Lovecraft, and which features Nyarlathotep; &quot;The Faceless God&quot; (features Nyarlathotep); &quot;The Grinning Ghoul&quot; (written after the manner of Lovecraft) and &quot;The Unspeakable Betrothal&quot; (vaguely attached to the Cthulhu Mythos). It was Bloch who invented, for example, the oft-cited Mythos texts &quot;De Vermis Mysteriis&quot; and &quot;Cultes des Goules&quot;. Many other stories influenced by Lovecraft were later collected in Bloch&#x27;s volume &quot;Mysteries of the Worm&quot; (now in its third, expanded edition). In 1935, Bloch wrote the tale &quot;Satan&#x27;s Servants&quot;, on which Lovecraft lent much advice, but none of the prose was by Lovecraft; this tale did not appear in print until 1949, in &quot;Something About Cats and Other Pieces&quot;.

The young Bloch appears, thinly disguised, as the character Robert Blake in Lovecraft&#x27;s story &quot;The Haunter of the Dark&quot; (1936), which is dedicated to Bloch. Bloch was the only individual to whom Lovecraft ever dedicated a story. In this story, Lovecraft kills off Robert Blake, the Bloch-based character, repaying a &quot;courtesy&quot; Bloch earlier paid Lovecraft with his 1935 tale &quot;The Shambler from the Stars&quot;, in which the Lovecraft-inspired figure dies; the story goes so far as to use Bloch&#x27;s then-current address (620 East Knapp Street) in Milwaukee. (Bloch even had a signed certificate from Lovecraft [and some of his creations] giving Bloch permission to kill Lovecraft off in a story.) Bloch later recalled &quot;believe me, beyond all doubt, I don&#x27;t know anyone else I&#x27;d rather be killed by.&quot; Bloch later wrote a third tale, &quot;The Shadow From the Steeple&quot;, picking up where &quot;The Haunter of the Dark&quot; finished (&quot;Weird Tales&quot; Sept 1950).

Lovecraft&#x27;s death in 1937 deeply affected Bloch, who was then aged only 20. He recalled &quot;Part of me died with him, I guess, not only because he was not a god, he was mortal, that is true, but because he had so little recognition in his own lifetime. There were no novels or collections published, no great realization, even here in Providence, of what was lost.&quot; Elsewhere he wrote, &quot;the news of his fate came to me as a shattering blow; all the more so because the world at large ignored his passing. Only my parents and a few correspondents seemed to sense my shock, and my feeling that a part of me had died with him.&quot;

After Lovecraft&#x27;s death in 1937, Bloch continued writing for &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, where he became one of its most popular authors. He also began contributing to other pulps, such as the science fiction magazine &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. Bloch broadened the scope of his fiction. His horror themes included voodoo (&quot;Mother of Serpents&quot;), the conte cruel (&quot;The Mandarin&#x27;s Canaries&quot;), demonic possession (&quot;Fiddler&#x27;s Fee&quot;), and black magic (&quot;Return to the Sabbat&quot;). Bloch visited Henry Kuttner in California in 1937. Bloch&#x27;s first science fiction story, &quot;Secret of the Observatory&quot;, was published in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; (August 1938).

===Milwaukee Fictioneers and the Depression===
In 1935 Bloch joined a writers&#x27; group, The Milwaukee Fictioneers, members of which included Stanley Weinbaum, Ralph Milne Farley and Raymond A. Palmer. Another member of the group was Gustav Marx, who offered Bloch a job writing copy in his advertising firm, also allowing Bloch to write stories in his spare time in the office. Bloch was close friends with C. L. Moore and her husband Henry Kuttner, who visited him in Milwaukee.

During the years of the Depression, Bloch appeared regularly in dramatic productions, writing and performing in his own sketches. Around 1936 he sold some gags to radio comedians Stoopnagle and Budd, and to Roy Atwell. Also in 1936, his tale &quot;The Grinning Ghoul&quot; was published in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; (June); &quot;The Opener of the Way&quot; appeared in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; (Oct); &quot;Mother of Serpents&quot; appeared in the December issue. The December issue also contained Lovecraft&#x27;s tale &quot;The Haunter of the Dark&quot; in which he killed off young author &quot;Robert Blake&quot;.

In 1937, following Lovecraft&#x27;s death, &quot;The Mannikin&quot; appeared in &quot;Weird Tales&quot; for April. &quot;Weird Tales&quot; published &quot;Return to the Sabbath&quot; in July 1938. Bloch&#x27;s first science fiction story, &quot;The Secret of the Observatory&quot; appeared in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; (Aug 1938). In a profile accompanying this tale, Bloch described himself as &quot;tall, dark, unhandsome&quot; with &quot;all the charm and personality of a swamp adder&quot;. He noted that &quot;I hate everything&quot;, but reserved particular dislike for &quot;bean soup, red nail polish, house-cleaning, and optimists&quot;.

=== Campaign manager for Carl Zeidler ===
In 1939, Bloch was contacted by James Doolittle, who was managing the campaign for Mayor of Milwaukee of a little-known assistant city attorney named Carl Zeidler. He was asked to work on Zeidler&#x27;s speechwriting, advertising, and photo ops, in collaboration with his long-time friend Harold Gauer. They created elaborate campaign shows; in Bloch&#x27;s 1993 autobiography, &quot;Once Around the Bloch&quot;, he gives an inside account of the campaign, and the innovations he and Gauer came up with – for instance, the original releasing-balloons-from-the-ceiling schtick. He comments bitterly on how, after Zeidler&#x27;s victory, they were ignored and not even paid their promised salaries. He ends the story with a wryly philosophical point:

Also in 1939, two of Bloch&#x27;s tales were published: &quot;The Strange Flight of Richard Clayton&quot; (&quot;Amazing Stories,&quot; August) and &quot;The Cloak&quot; (&quot;Unknown,&quot; March). Many of the stories Bloch published in &quot;Strange Stories&quot; in 1939 as by &#x27;Tarleton Fiske&#x27; were fantasy/horror hybrids of the &quot;contes cruels&quot; type.

===1940s and 1950s===



In October 1941, the tale &quot;A Good Knight&#x27;s Work&quot; in &quot;Unknown Worlds&quot; first appeared. Shortly thereafter, Bloch created the Damon Runyon-esque humorous series character Lefty Feep in the story &quot;Time Wounds All Heels&quot; &quot;Fantastic Adventures&quot; (April 1942). This magazine, along with &quot;Weird Tales,&quot; published most of the over 100 stories Bloch wrote in the first decade of his career. Around the same time, he began work as an advertising copywriter at the Gustav Marx Advertising Agency, a position he held until 1953. Marx allowed Bloch to write stories in the office in quiet times. Bloch published a total of 23 Lefty Feep stories in &quot;Fantastic Adventures&quot;, the last one published in 1950, but the bulk appeared during World War II. Feep&#x27;s character name had actually been coined by Bloch&#x27;s friend/collaborator Harold Gauer for their unpublished novel &quot;In the Land of Sky-Blue Ointments&quot;, Bloch also worked for a time in local vaudeville and tried to break into writing for nationally-known performers.

Bloch gradually evolved away from Lovecraftian imitations towards a unique style of his own. One of the first distinctly &quot;Blochian&quot; stories was &quot;Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper&quot; (&quot;Weird Tales&quot;, July 1943). The story was Bloch&#x27;s take on the Jack the Ripper legend, and was filled out with more genuine factual details of the case than many other fictional treatments. It cast the Ripper as an eternal being who must make human sacrifices to extend his immortality. It was adapted for both radio (in &quot;Stay Tuned for Terror&quot;) and television (as an episode of &quot;Thriller&quot; in 1961 adapted by Barré Lyndon). Bloch followed up this story with a number of others in a similar vein dealing with half-historic, half-legendary figures such as the Man in the Iron Mask (&quot;Iron Mask&quot;, 1944), the Marquis de Sade (&quot;The Skull of the Marquis de Sade&quot;, 1945) and Lizzie Borden (&quot;Lizzie Borden Took an Axe ...&quot;, 1946).

In 1944, Laird Cregar performed Bloch&#x27;s tale &quot;Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper&quot; over a coast-to-coast radio network.

Towards the end of World War Two, in 1945, Bloch was asked to write 39 15-minute episodes of his own radio horror show called &quot;Stay Tuned for Terror&quot;. Many of the programs were adaptations of his own pulp stories. (All episodes were broadcast, but recordings were thought to be lost. However, in 2020, two episodes, &quot;The Bogeyman Will Get You&quot; and &quot;Lizzie Borden Took an Axe&quot; were re-discovered amongst the archives of an old-time radio enthusiast. These episodes have now been posted on YouTube and Internet Archive).. The same year he published &quot;The Skull of the Marquis de Sade&quot; (&quot;Weird Tales,&quot; September issue). August Derleth&#x27;s Arkham House, Lovecraft&#x27;s publisher, published Bloch&#x27;s first collection of short stories, &quot;The Opener of the Way&quot;, in an edition of 2,000 copies, with jacket art by Ronald Clyne. At the same time, his best-known early tale, &quot;Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper&quot;, received considerable attention through dramatization on radio and reprinting in anthologies. This story, as noted below, involving a Ripper who has found literal immortality through his crimes, has been widely imitated (or plagiarized); Bloch himself would return to the theme (see below). Stories published in 1946 include &quot;Enoch&quot; (September issue of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;) and &quot;Lizzie Borden Took an Axe&quot; (&quot;Weird Tales&quot;, November).

Bloch&#x27;s first novel was published in hardcover – the thriller &quot;The Scarf&quot; (The Dial Press 1947; the Fawcett Gold medal paperback of 1966 features a revised text). It tells the story of a writer, Daniel Morley, who uses real women as models for his characters. But as soon as he is done writing the story, he is compelled to murder them, and always the same way: with the maroon scarf he has had since childhood. The story begins in Minneapolis and follows him and his trail of dead bodies to Chicago, New York City, and finally Hollywood, where his hit novel is going to be turned into a movie, and where his self-control may have reached its limit.

In 1948, Bloch was the Guest of Honor at Torcon I, World Science Fiction Convention, Toronto, Canada. In 1952 he published &quot;Lucy Comes to Stay&quot; (&quot;Weird Tales&quot;, January issue). Bloch popularised the &quot;Auction Bloch&quot; at science fiction conventions during the 1950s, a practice in which fans bid on professionals, buying an hour of their time. Bloch would auction off an hour of some well-known writer&#x27;s time at a convention to raise money for a worthy cause. (The time gave the winner an hour of personal interaction with the writer at the convention.) 

Bloch published three novels in 1954 – &quot;Spiderweb&quot;, &quot;The Kidnapper&quot; and &quot;The Will to Kill&quot; as he endeavored to support his family. That same year he was a weekly guest panelist on the TV quiz show &quot;It&#x27;s a Draw&quot;. &quot;Shooting Star&quot; (1958), a mainstream novel, was published in a double volume with a collection of Bloch&#x27;s stories titled &quot;Terror in the Night&quot;. &quot;This Crowded Earth&quot; (1958) was science fiction.

With the demise of &quot;Weird Tales&quot;, Bloch continued to have his fiction published in &quot;Amazing&quot;, &quot;Fantastic&quot;, &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, and &quot;Fantastic Universe&quot;; he was a particularly frequent contributor to &quot;Imagination&quot; and &quot;Imaginative Tales&quot;. His output of thrillers increased and he began to appear regularly in &quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;Ellery Queen&quot; and similar mystery magazines, and to such suspense and horror-fiction magazine projects as &quot;Shock&quot;.

===Jack the Ripper===
Bloch continued to revisit the Jack the Ripper theme. His contribution to Harlan Ellison&#x27;s 1967 science fiction anthology &quot;Dangerous Visions&quot; was a story, &quot;A Toy for Juliette&quot;, which evoked both Jack the Ripper and the Marquis de Sade in a time-travel story. The same anthology had Ellison&#x27;s sequel to it titled &quot;The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World&quot;. His earlier idea of the Ripper as an immortal being resurfaced in Bloch&#x27;s contribution to the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series episode &quot;Wolf in the Fold&quot;. His 1984 novel &quot;Night of the Ripper&quot; is set during the reign of Queen Victoria and follows the investigation of Inspector Frederick Abberline in attempting to apprehend the Ripper, and includes some famous Victorians such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle within the storyline.

===&quot;Psycho&quot;===
Bloch won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story for &quot;That Hellbound Train&quot; in 1959, the same year that his sixth novel, &quot;Psycho,&quot; was published. Bloch had written an earlier short story involving dissociative identity disorder, &quot;The Real Bad Friend&quot;, which appeared in the February 1957 &quot;Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine&quot;, that foreshadowed the 1959 novel &quot;Psycho&quot;. However, &quot;Psycho&quot; also has thematic links to the story &quot;Lucy Comes to Stay&quot;. Also in 1959, Bloch delivered a lecture titled &quot;Imagination and Modern Social Criticism&quot; at the University of Chicago; this was reprinted in the critical volume &quot;The Science Fiction Novel&quot; (Advent Publishers). His story &quot;The Hungry Eye&quot; appeared in &quot;Fantastic&quot; (May). This was also the year in which, despite having graduated from painting watercolours to oils, he gave up painting completely.

Norman Bates, the main character in &quot;Psycho&quot;, was very loosely based on two people. First was the real-life serial killer Ed Gein, about whom Bloch later wrote a fictionalized account, &quot;The Shambles of Ed Gein&quot;. (The story can be found in &quot;Crimes and Punishments: The Lost Bloch, Volume 3&quot;). Second, it has been indicated by several people, including Noel Carter (wife of Lin Carter) and Chris Steinbrunner, as well as allegedly by Bloch himself, that Norman Bates was partly based on Calvin Beck, publisher of &quot;Castle of Frankenstein&quot;. Bloch&#x27;s basing of the character of Norman Bates on Ed Gein is discussed in the documentary &quot;Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield&quot;, which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; (2003). However, Bloch also commented that it was the situation itself – a mass murderer living undetected and unsuspected in a typical small town in middle America – rather than Gein himself who sparked Bloch&#x27;s storyline. He writes: &quot;Thus the real-life murderer was not the role model for my character Norman Bates. Ed Gein didn&#x27;t own or operate a motel. Ed Gein didn&#x27;t kill anyone in the shower. Ed Gein wasn&#x27;t into taxidermy. Ed Gein didn&#x27;t stuff his mother, keep her body in the house, dress in a drag outfit, or adopt an alternative personality. These were the functions and characteristics of Norman Bates, and Norman Bates didn&#x27;t exist until I made him up. Out of my own imagination, I add, which is probably the reason so few offer to take showers with me.&quot;

Though Bloch had little involvement with the film version of his novel, which was directed by Alfred Hitchcock from an adapted screenplay by Joseph Stefano, he was to become most famous as its author. Bloch was awarded a special Mystery Writers of America scroll for the novel in 1961.

The novel is one of the first examples at full length of Bloch&#x27;s use of modern urban horror relying on the horrors of interior psychology rather than the supernatural. &quot;By the mid-1940s, I had pretty well mined the vein of ordinary supernatural themes until it had become varicose,&quot; Bloch explained to Douglas E. Winter in an interview. &quot;I realized, as a result of what went on during World War II and of reading the more widely disseminated work in psychology, that the real horror is not in the shadows, but in that twisted little world inside our own skulls.&quot; While Bloch was not the first horror writer to utilise a psychological approach (it originates in the work of Edgar Allan Poe), Bloch&#x27;s psychological approach in modern times was comparatively unique.

Bloch&#x27;s agent, Harry Altshuler, received a &quot;blind bid&quot; for the novel – the buyer&#x27;s name was not mentioned – of $7,500 for screen rights to the book. The bid eventually went to $9,500, which Bloch accepted. Bloch had never sold a book to Hollywood before. His contract with Simon &amp; Schuster included no bonus for a film sale. The publisher took 15 percent according to contract, while the agent took his 10%; Bloch wound up with about $6,750 before taxes. Despite the enormous profits generated by Hitchcock&#x27;s film, Bloch received no further direct compensation.

Only Hitchcock&#x27;s film was based on Bloch&#x27;s novel. The later films in the &quot;Psycho&quot; series bear no relation to either of Bloch&#x27;s sequel novels. Indeed, Bloch&#x27;s proposed script for the film &quot;Psycho II&quot; was rejected by the studio (as were many other submissions), and it was this that he subsequently adapted for his own sequel novel.

The film &quot;Hitchcock&quot; (2012) tells the story of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s making of the film version of &quot;Psycho&quot;. Although it mentions Bloch and his novel, Bloch himself is not a character in the movie.

===The early 1960s: Screenwriting and fiction===
Following his move to Hollywood, around 1960, Bloch had multiple assignments from various television companies. However, he was not allowed to write for five months when the Writers Guild had a strike. After the strike was over, he became a frequent scriptwriter for television and film projects in the mystery, suspense, and horror genre. His first assignments were for the Macdonald Carey vehicle, &quot;Lock-Up&quot;, (penning five episodes) as well as one for &quot;Whispering Smith&quot;. Further TV work included an episode of &quot;Bus Stop&quot; (&quot;I Kiss Your Shadow&quot;), 10 episodes of &quot;Thriller&quot; (1960–62, several based on his own stories), and 10 episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (1960–62). His short story collection &quot;Pleasant Dreams - Nightmares&quot; was published by Arkham House in 1960.

Bloch wrote the screenplay for &quot;The Cabinet of Caligari&quot; (1962), which is only very loosely related to the 1920 German silent film, and proved to be an unhappy experience. The same year, Bloch penned the story and teleplay &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; for &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. The episode was shelved when the NBC Television Network and sponsor Revlon called its ending &quot;too gruesome&quot; (by 1960s standards) for airing. Bloch was pleased later when the episode was included in the program&#x27;s syndication package to affiliate stations, where not one complaint was registered. Today, due to public domain status, the episode is readily available in home media formats from numerous distributors and is even available on free video on demand.

His TV work did not slow Bloch&#x27;s fictional output. In the early 1960s he published several novels, including &quot;The Dead Beat&quot; (1960), and &quot;Firebug&quot; (1961), for which Harlan Ellison, then an editor at Regency Books, contributed the first 1,200 words. In 1962 numerous works appeared in book form. Bloch&#x27;s novel &quot;The Couch&quot; (1962) (the basis for the screenplay of his first movie, filmed the same year) was published. That year several Bloch short story collections – &quot;Atoms and Evil&quot;, &quot;More Nightmares&quot; and &quot;Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper&quot; – were published, as well as another novel, &quot;Terror&quot; (whose working titles included &quot;Amok&quot; and &quot;Kill for Kali&quot;). Editor Earl Kemp assembled a selection of Bloch&#x27;s prolific output for fan magazines as &quot;The Eight Stage of Fandom: Selections from 25 years of Fan Writing&quot; (Advent Publishers). In this era, Stephen King later wrote, &quot;What Bloch did with such novels as &quot;The Deadbeat&quot;, &quot;The Scarf&quot;, &quot;Firebug&quot;, &quot;Psycho&quot;, and &quot;The Couch&quot; was to re-discover the suspense novel and reinvent the antihero as first discovered by James Cain.&quot;

During 1963, Bloch saw into print two further collections of short stories, &quot;Bogey men&quot; and &quot;Horror-7&quot;. In 1964 Bloch married Eleanor Alexander and wrote original screenplays for two films produced and directed by William Castle, &quot;Strait-Jacket&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Night Walker&quot; (also 1964), along with &quot;The Skull&quot; (1965). The latter film was based on his short story &quot;The Skull of the Marquis de Sade&quot;.

===The 1960s and 1970s: Film &amp; TV writing===
Bloch&#x27;s further TV writing in this period included &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; (7 episodes, 1962–1965), &quot;I Spy&quot; (1 episode, 1966), &quot;Run for Your Life&quot; (1 episode, 1966), and &quot;The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.&quot; (1 episode, 1967). He penned three scripts for the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series which were screened in 1966 and 1967: &quot;What Are Little Girls Made Of?&quot;, &quot;Wolf in the Fold&quot; (another Jack the Ripper&quot;.

In 1968, Bloch returned to London to do two episodes for the English Hammer Films series &quot;Journey to the Unknown&quot; for Twentieth Century Fox. One of the episodes, &quot;The Indian Spirit Guide&quot;, was included in the American TV movie &quot;Journey to Midnight&quot; (1968). The other episode was &quot;Girl of My Dreams&quot;, co-scripted with Michael J. Bird and based on the eponymous story by Richard Matheson.

Following the movie &quot;The Skull&quot; (1965), which was based on a Bloch story but scripted by Milton Subotsky, he wrote the screenplays for five feature films produced by Amicus Productions – &quot;The Psychopath&quot; (1966), &quot;The Deadly Bees&quot; (co-written with Anthony Marriott, 1967), &quot;Torture Garden&quot; (also 1967), &quot;The House That Dripped Blood&quot; (1971) and &quot;Asylum&quot; (1972). The last two films featured stories written by Bloch that were printed first in anthologies he wrote in the 1940s and early 1950s.

During the 1970s, Bloch wrote two TV movies for director Curtis Harrington – &quot;The Cat Creature&quot; (1973) (an &quot;ABC Movie of the Week&quot;) and &quot;The Dead Don&#x27;t Die&quot;. &quot;The Cat Creature&quot; was an unhappy production experience for Bloch. Producer Doug Cramer wanted to do an update of &quot;Cat People&quot; (1942), the Val Lewton-produced film. Bloch commented: &quot;Instead, I suggested a blending of the elements of several well-remembered films, and came up with a story line which dealt with the Egyptian cat-goddess (Bast), reincarnation and the first bypass operation ever performed on an artichoke heart.&quot; A detailed account of the troubled production of the film is described in Bloch&#x27;s autobiography.

Bloch meanwhile (interspersed between his screenplays for Amicus Productions and other projects), penned single episodes for &quot;Night Gallery&quot; (1971), &quot;Ghost Story&quot; (1972), &quot;The Manhunter&quot; (1974), and &quot;Gemini Man&quot; (1976).

===The later 1960s and 1970s: Fiction===
In 1965, two further collections of short stories appeared - &quot;The Skull of the Marquis de Sade&quot; and &quot;Tales in a Jugular Vein&quot;. 1966 saw Bloch win the Ann Radcliffe Award for Television and publisher yet another collection of shorts - &quot;Chamber of Horrors&quot;. Bloch returned to the site of his childhood home at 620 East Knapp St, Milwaukee (the address used by Lovecraft for the character Robert Blake in &quot;The Haunter of the Dark&quot;) only to find the neighborhood razed and the entire neighborhood leveled and replaced by expressway approaches.

In 1967, another Bloch collection, &quot;The Living Demons&quot; was issued. He also published another classic story of Jack the Ripper, &quot;A Toy for Juliette&quot; in Harlan Ellison&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous Visions&quot; anthology. In 1968 he published a duo of long sf novellas as &quot;Ladies&#x27; Day&quot; and &quot;This Crowded Earth&quot;. His novel &quot;The Star Stalker&quot; was published, and &quot;Dragons and Nightmares&quot; (the first collection of Lefty Feep stories) appeared in hardcover (Mirage Press).

The collection &quot;Bloch and Bradbury&quot; (a collaboration with Ray Bradbury) and the hardcover novel &quot;The Todd Dossier&quot;, originally as by Collier Young, were published in 1969.
Bloch won a second Ann Radcliffe Award, this time for Literature, in 1969. That same year, Bloch was invited to the Second International Film Festival in Rio de Janeiro, March 23–31, along with other science fiction writers from the United States, Britain and Europe.

In 1971, Bloch served as president of the Mystery Writers of America, meanwhile publishing the novel &quot;Sneak Preview&quot;, the collection &quot;Fear Today, Gone Tomorrow,&quot; and the short novel &quot;It&#x27;s All in Your Mind&quot;. In 1972 he published another novel, &quot;Night-World&quot;. In 1973 Bloch was the Guest of Honor at Torcon II, World Science Fiction Convention, Toronto. 1974 saw the publication of his novel &quot;American Gothic&quot;, inspired by the true life story of serial killer H.H. Holmes.

In 1975, Bloch won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the First World Fantasy Convention held in Providence, Rhode Island. The award was a bust of H. P. Lovecraft. The occasion of this convention was the first time Bloch actually visited the city of Providence. An audio recording was made of Robert Bloch during that 1975 convention, accessible online.

In 1976, two records of Bloch recordings of his stories were released by Alternate World recordings – &quot;&quot;&quot;Gravely, Robert Bloch!&quot; and &quot;Blood! The Life and Times of Jack the Ripper! (with Harlan Ellison). In 1977, Lester del Rey edited &quot;The Best of Robert Bloch&quot; for Del Rey books. Two further short story collections appeared – &quot;Cold Chills&quot; and &quot;The King of Terrors.&quot;

Bloch continued to published short story collections throughout this period. His &quot;Selected Stories&quot; (reprinted in paperback with the incorrect title &quot;The Complete Stories&quot;) appeared in three volumes just prior to his death, although many previously uncollected tales have appeared in volumes published since 1997 (see below). Bloch also contributed the story &quot;Heir Apparent&quot;, set in Andre Norton&#x27;s Witch World, to &quot;Tales of the Witch World&quot; (Vol. 1), NY: Tor, 1987.

1979 saw the publication of Bloch&#x27;s novel &quot;There is a Serpent in Eden&quot; (also reissued as &quot;The Cunning&quot;), and two more short story collections, &quot;Out of the Mouths of graves&quot; and &quot;Such Stuff as Screams Are Made Of.&quot;

His numerous novels of the 1970s demonstrate Bloch&#x27;s thematic range, from science fiction – &quot;Sneak Preview&quot; (1971) – through horror novels such as the loving Lovecraftian tribute &quot;Strange Eons&quot; (Whispers Press, 1978) and the non-supernatural mystery &quot;There is a Serpent in Eden&quot; (1979).

===The 1980s===
Bloch&#x27;s screenplay-writing career continued active through the 1980s, with teleplays for &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot; (one episode, 1980), &quot;Darkroom&quot; (two episodes,1981), &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (1 episode, 1986), &quot;Tales from the Darkside&quot; (three episodes, 1984–87: &quot;Beetles&quot;, &quot;A Case of the Stubborns&quot; and &quot;Everybody Needs a Little Love&quot;) and &quot;Monsters&quot; (three episodes, 1988–1989: &quot;The Legacy&quot;, &quot;Mannikins of Horror&quot;, and &quot;Reaper&quot;). No further screen work appeared in the last five years before his death, although an adaptation of his &quot;collaboration&quot; with Edgar Allan Poe, &quot;The Lighthouse&quot;, was filmed as an episode of &quot;The Hunger&quot; in 1998.

&quot;The First World Fantasy Convention: Three Authors Remember&quot; (Necronomicon Press, 1980) features reminiscences of that important event by Bloch, T.E.D. Klein and Fritz Leiber. In 1981, Zebra Books issued the first edition of the Cthulhu Mythos-themed collection &quot;Mysteries of the Worm&quot;. This item was reprinted some years later in an expanded edition by Chaosium.

Bloch&#x27;s sequel to the original &quot;Psycho&quot;, &quot;Psycho II&quot;, was published in 1982 and in 1983 he novelized &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot;. His novel &quot;Night of the Ripper&quot; (1984), was another return to one of Bloch&#x27;s favourite themes, the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888.

In 1986, Scream Press published the hardcover omnibus &quot;Unholy Trinity&quot;, collecting three by now scarce Bloch novels, &quot;The Scarf&quot;, &quot;The Dead Beat&quot;, and &quot;The Couch.&quot; A second retrospective selection of Bloch&#x27;s nonfiction was published by NESFA Press as &quot;Out of My Head.&quot;

In 1987, Bloch celebrated his 70th birthday. Underwood-Miller issued the three-volume hardcover set &quot;The Selected Stories of Robert Bloch&quot; (individual volumes titled &quot;Final Reckonings&quot;, &quot;Bitter Ends&quot; and &quot;Last Rites&quot;). When Citadel Press reissued this in paperback they incorrectly named it &quot;The Collected Stories of Robert Bloch.&quot; The same year a collection, &quot;Midnight Pleasures&quot; appeared from Doubleday, and &quot;Lost in Time and Space with Lefty Feep&quot; (Creatures at Large Press) collected a number of the stories on the Lefty Feep series. The latter was the first of a projected series of three volumes, but the further volumes were never published. In 1988, Tor Books reissued Bloch&#x27;s scarce second novel, &quot;The Kidnapper.&quot;

In 1989, several works were published: the collection &quot;Fear and Trembling&quot;, the thriller novel &quot;Lori&quot; (later adapted as a standalone graphic novel) and another omnibus of long out-of-print early novels, &quot;Screams&quot; (containing &quot;The Will to Kill&quot;, &quot;Firebug&quot;, and &quot;The Star Stalker&quot;). Randall D. Larson issued &quot;The Robert Bloch Companion: Collected Interviews 1969-1986&quot; (Starmont House), together with &quot;Robert Bloch&quot; (Starmont Reader&#x27;s Guide No 37), an exhaustive study of Bloch&#x27;s work, and &quot;The Complete Robert Bloch: An Illustrated, Comprehensive Bibliography&quot; (Fandom Unlimited Enterprises). Larson&#x27;s three books were bound in hardcover and distributed by Borgo Press.

===The 1990s: Last works===
Bloch&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Jekyll Legacy&quot; (1990), was a collaboration with Andre Norton and a sequel to Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;. The same year he returned to the Norman Bates &quot;mythos&quot; with &quot;Psycho House&quot; (Tor), the third Psycho novel. As with the second novel in the sequence, it bears no relation to the film titled &quot;Psycho III&quot;. It would prove to be his last published novel.

In February 1991, he was given the Honor of Master of Ceremonies at the first World Horror Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Weird Tales issued a special Robert Bloch issue in Spring, including his screenplay for the televised version of his tale &quot;Beetles&quot;&quot;. A standalone chapbook of the story &quot;Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper&quot; was issued in both hardcover and paperback by Pulphouse, and Bloch co-edited with Martin H. Greenberg the original anthology &quot;Psycho-Paths&quot; (Tor). In 1991 Bloch contributed an Introduction to &quot;In Search of Lovecraft&quot; by J. Vernon Shea.

In 1992, Bloch celebrated his 75th birthday with a bash at a Los Angeles mystery/horror bookstore which was attended by many sf/horror notables. In 1993, he published his &quot;unauthorized autobiography&quot;, &quot;Once Around the Bloch&quot; (Tor) and edited the original anthology &quot;Monsters in Our Midst&quot;.

In early 1994, Fedogan and Bremer published a collection of 39 of his stories, &quot;The Early Fears&quot;. Bloch began editing a new original anthology, &quot;Robert Bloch&#x27;s Psychos&quot; but was unable to complete work on it prior to his death; Martin H. Greenberg finished the work posthumously and the book appeared several years later (1997).

==Personal life==
On October 2, 1940, Bloch married Marion Ruth Holcombe; it was reportedly a marriage of convenience designed to keep Bloch out of the army. During their marriage, she suffered (initially undiagnosed) from tuberculosis of the bone, which affected her ability to walk.

After working for 11 years for the Gustav Marx Advertising Agency in Milwaukee, Bloch left in 1953 and moved to Weyauwega, Marion&#x27;s home town, so she could be close to friends and family. Although she was eventually cured of tuberculosis, she and Bloch divorced in 1963. Bloch&#x27;s daughter Sally (born 1943) elected to stay with him.

On January 18, 1964, Bloch met recently widowed Eleanor (&quot;Elly&quot;) Alexander (née Zalisko), who had lost her first husband, writer/producer John Alexander, to a heart attack three months earlier, and married her in a civil ceremony on the following October 16. Elly was a fashion model and cosmetician. They honeymooned in Tahiti, and in 1965 visited London, then British Columbia. They remained happily married until Bloch&#x27;s death. Elly remained in the Los Angeles area for several years after selling their Laurel Canyon Home to fans of Bloch, eventually choosing to go home to Canada to be closer to her own family. She died March 7, 2007, at the Betel Home in Selkirk, Manitoba, Canada. Her ashes have been placed next to Bloch&#x27;s in a similar book-shaped urn at Pierce Brothers in Westwood, California.

Bloch died on September 23, 1994 from cancer aged 77. He survived by seven months the death of another member of the original &quot;Lovecraft Circle&quot;, Frank Belknap Long, who had died in January 1994.

Bloch was cremated and his ashes interred in the Room of Prayer columbarium at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. His wife Elly is also interred there.

The Robert Bloch Award is presented at the annual NecronomiCon convention. Its recipient in 2013 was editor and scholar S.T. Joshi. The award is in the shape of the Shining Trapezohedron as described in H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s tale dedicated to Bloch, &quot;The Haunter of the Dark&quot;.

It contains brief tributes to Bloch from Harlan Ellison, Ray Bradbury, Richard Matheson, Julius Schwartz and Peter Straub incorporated within a piece called &quot;Robert Bloch: A Retrospective&quot; compiled by Clifford Lawrence. The first part of the text of Bloch&#x27;s story &quot;The Past Master&quot; is also reprinted in this issue.

Bloch also contributed a script as part of the DC one-shot benefit comic &quot;Heroes Against Hunger&quot;.

The character Inspector Bloch in the Italian comic Dylan Dog is partly inspired by Robert Bloch.

==Films==

The following is a list of films based on Bloch&#x27;s work. For some of these he wrote the original screenplay; for others, he supplied the story or a novel (as in the case of &quot;Psycho&quot;) on which the screenplay was based.

==Unproduced screenplays==
Bloch wrote a number of screenplays that remain unproduced. These include &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot; for MGM (loosely based on Ray Bradbury&#x27;s story &quot;Black Ferris&quot;); &quot;Night-World&quot; (from Bloch&#x27;s novel, for MGM; this was aborted when its producer lost confidence, and his job when MGM went under new management); &quot;The Twenty-First Witch&quot;; &quot;Day of the Comet&quot; (from the H. G. Wells story) and &quot;Berg!&quot; (both for George Pal); and a television adaptation of &quot;Out of the Aeons&quot;. See also &quot;The Todd Dossier&quot;. Other unproduced scripts include a science fiction movie commissioned by AIP for 1972 release, &quot;Barracuda 2000 A.D.&quot; (about a cycle gang surviving atomic holocaust in 2000); James Whiton (co-writer of &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot;) also worked on Bloch&#x27;s script but AIP abandoned the film when the bottom fell out of the cycle-picture vogue. There was also &quot;Linda&quot;, based on a John D. MacDonald novella; Bloch&#x27;s script was not used but the movie was eventually done in another form on TV as a 1973 ABC &quot;Saturday Suspense Movie&quot; starring Stella Stevens, with Ed Nelson playing Paul and John McIntire.

Some scenes from Bloch&#x27;s incomplete screenplay for the unproduced movie &quot;Earthman&#x27;s Burden&quot;, to have been based on the Hoka stories of Gordon R. Dickson and Poul Anderson, appear in Richard Matheson and Ricia Mainhardt, eds., &quot;Robert Bloch: Appreciations of the Master&quot;. New York: Tor Books, 1995, pp. 157–63.

==Documentaries==
Bloch appeared in the documentary &quot;The Fantasy Film Worlds of George Pal&quot; (1985) produced and directed by Arnold Leibovit.

<doc id="26244" wikidata="Q187851" url="?curid=26244" title="Recorder (musical instrument)">
<text>The recorder is a family of woodwind musical instruments in the group known as &quot;internal duct flutes&quot;: flutes with a whistle mouthpiece, also known as fipple flutes, although this is an archaic term. A recorder can be distinguished from other duct flutes by the presence of a thumb-hole for the upper hand and seven finger-holes: three for the upper hand and four for the lower. It is the most prominent duct flute in the western classical tradition.

Recorders are made in various sizes with names and compasses roughly corresponding to various vocal ranges. The sizes most commonly in use today are the soprano (also known as descant, lowest note C5), alto (also known as treble, lowest note F4), tenor (lowest note C4), and bass (lowest note F3). Recorders were traditionally constructed from wood or ivory. Modern professional instruments are almost invariably of wood, often boxwood; student and scholastic recorders are commonly of moulded plastic. The recorders&#x27; internal and external proportions vary, but the bore is generally reverse conical (i.e. tapering towards the foot) to cylindrical, and all recorder fingering systems make extensive use of forked fingerings.

The recorder is first documented in Europe in the Middle Ages, and continued to enjoy wide popularity in the Renaissance and Baroque periods, but was little used in the Classical and Romantic periods. It was revived in the twentieth century as part of the historically informed performance movement, and became a popular amateur and educational instrument. Composers who have written for the recorder include Monteverdi, Lully, Purcell, Handel, Vivaldi, Telemann, Bach, Hindemith, and Berio. There are many professional recorder players who demonstrate the full solo range of the instrument, and a large community of amateurs.

The sound of the recorder is often described as clear and sweet, and has historically been associated with birds and shepherds. It is notable for its quick response and its corresponding ability to produce a wide variety of articulations. This ability, coupled with its open finger holes, allow it to produce a wide variety of tone colours and special effects. Acoustically, its tone is relatively pure and, when the edge is positioned in the center of the airjet, odd harmonics predominate in its sound (when the edge is decidedly off-center, an even distribution of harmonics occurs).

==Name==
The instrument has been known by its modern English name at least since the fourteenth century. David Lasocki reports the earliest use of &quot;recorder&quot; in the household accounts of the Earl of Derby (later King Henry IV) in 1388, which register (one pipe called &#x27;Recordour&#x27;).

By the fifteenth century, the name had appeared in English literature. The earliest references are in John Lydgate&#x27;s Temple of Glas ( 1430): &quot;.&quot; (&#x27;These little shepherds fluting all day long ... on these small recorders, on flutes.&#x27;) and in Lydgate&#x27;s Fall of Princes ( 1431–1438): &quot;, / .&quot; (&#x27;Pan, god of Nature, with his pipes seven, / of recorders found first the melodies.&#x27;)

=== Etymology ===
The instrument name &quot;recorder&quot; derives from the Latin (to call to mind, remember, recollect), by way of Middle-French verb (before 1349; to remember, to learn by heart, repeat, relate, recite, play music) and its derivative (; one who retells, a minstrel). The association between the various, seemingly-disparate, meanings of &quot;recorder&quot; can be attributed to the role of the medieval &quot;jongleur&quot; in learning poems by heart and later reciting them, sometimes with musical accompaniment.

Appending the name &quot;recorder&quot; to the instrument itself is uniquely English: In Middle-French there is no equivalent noun sense of referring to a musical instrument. The English verb &quot;record&quot; (from Middle-French , early thirteenth century) meant &quot;to learn by heart, to commit to memory, to go over in one&#x27;s mind, to recite&quot;; but the term did not refer to &quot;playing music&quot; until the sixteenth century. It was long after the English recorder was so-named that it gained two additional meanings: &quot;silently practicing a tune&quot;, or &quot;sing or render in song&quot;—both referring almost-exclusively to songbirds.

Partridge indicates that the use of the instrument by led to its association with the verb: the minstrel&#x27;s action, a &quot;recorder&quot; the minstrel&#x27;s tool. The reason is uncertain why this flute instrument—rather than some other instrument played by the )—is known as the recorder.

=== &quot;Flute&quot; and &quot;recorder&quot; ===
The introduction of the Baroque recorder to England by a group of French professionals in 1673 popularised the French name for the instrument, , or simply , a name previously (and subsequently) reserved for the transverse instrument. Until about 1695, the names &quot;recorder&quot; and &quot;flute&quot; overlapped, but from 1673 to the late 1720s in England, the word &quot;flute&quot; always meant recorder. In the 1720s, as the transverse flute overtook the recorder in popularity, English adopted the convention already present in other European languages of qualifying the word &quot;flute&quot;, calling the recorder variously the &quot;common flute&quot;, &quot;common English-flute&quot;, or simply &quot;English flute&quot; while the transverse instrument was distinguished as the &quot;German flute&quot; or simply &quot;flute&quot;. Until at least 1765, some writers still used &quot;flute&quot; to mean recorder.

=== Other languages ===
Until the mid-eighteenth century, musical scores written in Italian refer to the instrument as , whereas the transverse instrument was called . This distinction, like the English switch from &quot;recorder&quot; to &quot;flute&quot;, has caused confusion among modern editors, writers and performers.

Indeed, in most European languages, the first term for the recorder was the word for flute alone. In the present day, cognates of the word &quot;flute&quot;, when used without qualifiers, remain ambiguous and may refer to either the recorder, the modern concert flute, or other non-western flutes. Starting in the 1530s, these languages began to add qualifiers to specify this particular flute.

== Nomenclature ==
Since the fifteenth century, a variety of sizes of recorder have been documented, but a consistent terminology and notation for the different sizes was not formulated until the twentieth century.

=== Modern recorders ===
Today, recorder sizes are named after the different vocal ranges. This is not, however, a reflection of sounding pitch, and serves primarily to denote the pitch relationships between the different instruments. Groups of recorders played together are referred to as &quot;consorts&quot;. Recorders are also often referred to by their lowest sounding note: &quot;recorder in F&quot; refers to a recorder with lowest note F, in any octave.

The table in this section shows the standard names of modern recorders in F and C and their respective ranges. Music composed after the modern revival of the recorder most frequently uses soprano, alto, tenor, and bass recorders, although sopranino and great bass are also fairly common. Consorts of recorders are often referred to using the terminology of organ registers: 8′ (8 foot) pitch referring to a consort sounding as written, 4′ pitch a consort sounding an octave above written, and 16′ a consort sounding an octave below written. The combination of these consorts is also possible.

As a rule of thumb, the tessitura of a baroque recorder lies approximately one octave above the tessitura of the human voice type after which it is named. For example, the tessitura of a soprano voice is roughly C4–C6, while the tessitura of a soprano recorder is C5–C7.

Modern variations include standard British terminology, due to Arnold Dolmetsch, which refers to the recorder in C5 (soprano) as the descant and the recorder in F4 (alto) as the treble. As conventions and instruments vary, especially for larger and more uncommon instruments, it is often practical to state the recorder&#x27;s lowest note along with its name to avoid confusion.

==== Notation ====
Modern recorder parts are notated in the key they sound in. Parts for alto, tenor and contrabass recorders are notated at pitch, while parts for sopranino, soprano, bass, and great bass are typically notated an octave below their sounding pitch. As a result, soprano and tenor recorders are notated identically; alto and sopranino are notated identically; and bass and contrabass recorders are notated identically. Octave clefs may be used to indicate the sounding pitch, but usage is inconsistent.

Rare sizes and notations include the garklein flutlein, which may be notated two octaves below its sounding pitch, and the sub-contrabass, which may be notated an octave above its sounding pitch.

=== Historical recorders ===
The earliest known document mentioning &quot;a pipe called Recordour&quot; dates from 1388.
Historically, recorders were used to play vocal music and parts written for other instruments, or for a general instrument. As a result, it was frequently the performers&#x27; responsibility to read parts not specifically intended for the instrument and to choose appropriate instruments. When such consorts consisted only of recorders, the pitch relationships between the parts were typically preserved, but when recorders were combined with other instruments, octave discrepancies were often ignored.

Recorder consorts in the sixteenth century were tuned in fifths and only occasionally employed tuning by octaves as seen in the modern C, F recorder consort. This means that consorts could be composed of instruments nominally in B, F, C, G, D, A and even E, although typically only three or four distinct sizes were used simultaneously. To use modern terminology, these recorders were treated as transposing instruments: consorts would be read identically to a consort made up of F3, C4, and G4 instruments. This is made possible by the fact that adjacent sizes are separated by fifths, with few exceptions. These parts would be written using &quot;chiavi naturali&quot;, allowing the parts to roughly fit in the range of a single staff, and also in the range of the recorders of the period. (see Renaissance structure)

Transpositions (&quot;registers&quot;), such as C3–G3–D4, G3–D4–A4, or B2–F3–C4, all read as F3–C4–G4 instruments, were possible as described by Praetorius in his &quot;Syntagma Musicum&quot;. Three sizes of instruments could be used to play four-part music by doubling the middle size, e.g. F3–C4–C4–G4, or play six-part music by doubling the upper size and tripling the middle size, e.g. F3–C4–C4–C4–G4–G4. Modern nomenclature for such recorders refers to the instruments&#x27; relationship to the other members of consort, rather than their absolute pitch, which may vary. The instruments from lowest to highest are called &quot;great bass&quot;, &quot;bass&quot;, &quot;basset&quot;, &quot;tenor&quot;, &quot;alto&quot;, and &quot;soprano&quot;. Potential sizes include: great bass in F2; bass in B2 or C3; basset in F3 or G3; tenor in B3, C4 or D4; alto in F4, G4 or A4; and soprano in C5 or D5.

The alto in F4 is the standard recorder of the Baroque, although there is a small repertoire written for other sizes. In seventeenth-century England, smaller recorders were named for their relationship to the alto and notated as transposing instruments with respect to it: third flute (A4), fifth flute (soprano; C5), sixth flute (D5), and octave flute (sopranino; F5). The term &quot;flute du quart&quot;, or fourth flute (B4), was used by Charles Dieupart, although curiously he treated it as a transposing instrument in relation to the soprano rather than the alto. In Germanic countries, the equivalent of the same term, &quot;Quartflöte&quot;, was applied both to the tenor in C4, the interval being measured down from the alto in F4, and to a recorder in C5 (soprano), the interval of a fourth apparently being measured up from an alto in G4. Recorder parts in the Baroque were typically notated using the treble clef, although they may also be notated in French violin clef (G clef on the bottom line of the staff).

In modern usage, recorders not in C or F are alternatively referred to using the name of the closest instrument in C or F, followed by the lowest note. For example, a recorder with lowest note G4 may be known as a G-alto or alto in G, a recorder with lowest note D5 (also &quot;sixth flute&quot;) as a D-soprano or soprano in D, and a recorder in G3 as a G-bass or G-basset. This usage is not totally consistent. Notably, the baroque recorder in D4 is not commonly referred to as a D-tenor nor a D-alto; it is most commonly referred to using the historical name &quot;voice flute&quot;.

==Structure==
===Materials===

Recorders have historically been constructed from hardwoods and ivory, sometimes with metal tone keys. Since the modern revival of the recorder, plastics have been used in the mass manufacture of recorders, as well as by a few individual makers.

Today, a wide variety of hardwoods are used to make recorder bodies. Relatively fewer varieties of wood are used to make recorder blocks, which are often made of red cedar, chosen because of its rot resistance, ability to absorb water, and low expansion when wet. A recent innovation is the use of synthetic ceramics in the manufacture of recorder blocks.

=== Larger recorders ===
Some recorders have tone holes too far apart for a player&#x27;s hands to reach, or too large to cover with the pads of the fingers. In either case, more ergonomically placed keys can be used to cover the tone holes. Keys also allow the design of longer instruments with larger tone holes. Keys are most common in recorders larger than the alto. Instruments larger than the tenor need at least one key so the player can cover all eight holes. Keys are sometimes also used on smaller recorders to allow for comfortable hand stretch, and acoustically improved hole placement and size.

When playing a larger recorder, a player may not be able to simultaneously reach the keys or tone holes with the fingers and reach the windway with the mouth. In this case, a bocal may be used to allow the player to blow into the recorder while maintaining a comfortable hand position. Alternatively, some recorders have a bent bore that positions the windway closer to the keys or finger holes so the player can comfortably reach both. Instruments with a single bend are known as &quot;knick&quot; or bent-neck recorders.

=== Modern developments ===
Some newer designs of recorder are now being produced. Recorders with a square cross-section may be produced more cheaply and in larger sizes than comparable recorders manufactured by turning. Another area is the development of instruments with a greater dynamic range and more powerful bottom notes. These modern designs make it easier to be heard in concertos. Finally, recorders with a downward extension of a semitone are becoming available; such instruments can play a full three octaves in tune.

===German fingering===
In the early twentieth century, Peter Harlan developed a recorder with apparently simpler fingering, called German fingering. A recorder designed for German fingering has a hole five that is smaller than hole four, whereas baroque and neo-baroque recorders have a hole four that is smaller than hole five. The immediate difference in fingering is for F (soprano) or B (alto), which on a neo-baroque instrument must be fingered 0 123 4–67. With German fingering, this becomes a simpler 0 123 4 – – –. Unfortunately, however, this makes many other chromatic notes too out of tune to be usable. German fingering became popular in Europe, especially Germany, in the 1930s, but rapidly became obsolete in the 1950s as people began to treat the recorder more seriously, and the limitations of German fingering became more widely appreciated. Recorders with German fingering are today manufactured exclusively for educational purposes.

=== Pitch ===
Modern recorders are most commonly pitched at A=440 Hz, but among serious amateurs and professionals, other pitch standards are often found. For the performance of baroque music, A=415 Hz is the &quot;de facto&quot; standard, while pre-Baroque music is often performed at A=440 Hz or A=466 Hz. These pitch standards are intended to reflect the broad variation in pitch standards throughout the history of the recorder. In various regions, contexts, and time periods, pitch standards have varied from A=~392 Hz to A=~520 Hz. The pitches A=415 Hz and A=466 Hz, a semitone lower and a semitone higher than A=440 Hz respectively, were chosen because they may be used with harpsichords or chamber organs that transpose up or down a semitone from A=440. These pitch standards allow recorder players to collaborate with other instrumentalists at a pitch other than A=440 Hz.

Some recorder makers produce instruments at pitches other than the three standard pitches above, and recorders with interchangeable bodies at different pitches.

== Acoustics ==
=== Basic sound production ===
The recorder produces sound in the manner of a whistle or an organ flue pipe. In normal play, the player blows into the &quot;windway&quot; (B), a narrow channel in the &quot;head joint&quot;, which directs a stream of air across a gap called the &quot;window&quot;, at a sharp edge called the &quot;labium&quot; (C). The air stream alternately travels above and below the labium, exciting standing waves in the bore of the recorder, and producing sound waves that emanate away from the window. Feedback from the resonance of the tube regulates the pitch of the sound.

In recorders, as in all woodwind instruments, the air column inside the instrument behaves like a vibrating string, to use a musical analogy, and has multiple modes of vibration. These waves produced inside the instrument are not travelling waves, like those the ear perceives as sound, but rather stationary standing waves consisting of areas of high pressure and low pressure inside the tube, called nodes. The perceived pitch is the lowest, and typically loudest, mode of vibration in the air column. The other pitches are &quot;harmonics&quot;, or &quot;overtones&quot;. Players typically describe recorder pitches by the number of nodes in the air column. Notes with a single node are in the &quot;first register,&quot; notes with two nodes in the &quot;second register,&quot; etc. As the number of nodes in the tube increases, the number of notes a player can produce in a given register decreases because of the physical constraint of the spacing of the nodes in the bore. On a Baroque recorder, the first, second, and third registers span about a major ninth, a major sixth, and a minor third respectively.

=== Harmonic profile ===
The recorder sound, for the most part, lacks high harmonics and odd harmonics predominate in its sound with the even harmonics being almost entirely absent, although the harmonic profile of the recorder sound varies from recorder to recorder, and from fingering to fingering. As a result of the lack of high harmonics, writers since Praetorius have remarked that it is difficult for the human ear to perceive correctly the sounding octave of the recorder.

==== Air ====
As in organ flue pipes, the sounding pitch of duct type whistles is affected by the velocity of the air stream as it impinges upon the labium. The pitch generally increases with velocity of the airstream, up to a point.

Air speed can also be used to influence the number of pressure nodes in a process called over blowing. At higher airstream velocities, lower modes of vibration of the air column become unstable, resulting in a change of register.

The air stream is affected by the shaping of the surfaces in the head of the recorder (the &quot;voicing&quot;), and the way the player blows air into the windway. Recorder voicing is determined by physical parameters such as the proportions and curvature of the windway along both the longitudinal and latitudinal axes, the bevelled edges (&quot;chamfers&quot;) of the windway facing towards the labium, the length of the window, the sharpness of the labium (i.e. the steepness of the ramp) among other parameters. The player is able to control the speed and turbulence of the airstream using the diaphragm and vocal tract.

==== Fingers ====
The finger holes, used in combination or partially covered, affect the sounding pitch of the instrument.

At the most basic level, the sequential uncovering of finger holes increases the sounding pitch of the instrument by decreasing the effective sounding length of the instrument, and vice versa for the sequential covering of holes. In the fingering 01234567, only the bell of the instrument is open, resulting in a low pressure node at the bell end of the instrument. The fingering 0123456 sounds at a higher pitch because the seventh hole and the bell both release air, creating a low pressure node at the seventh hole.

Besides sequential uncovering, recorders can use forked fingering to produce tones other than those produced by simple sequential lifting of fingers. In the fingering 0123, air leaks from the open holes 4,5,6, and 7. The pressure inside the bore is higher at the fourth hole than at the fifth, and decreases further at the 6th and 7th holes. Consequently, the most air leaks from the fourth hole and the least air leaks from the seventh hole. As a result, covering the fourth hole affects the pitch more than covering any of the holes below it. Thus, at the same air pressure, the fingering 01235 produces a pitch between 0123 and 01234. Forked fingerings allow recorder players to obtain fine gradations in pitch and timbre.

A recorder&#x27;s pitch is also affected by the partial covering of holes. This technique is an important tool for intonation, and is related to the fixed process of tuning a recorder, which involves the adjustment of the size and shape of the finger holes through carving and the application of wax.

One essential use of partial covering is in &quot;leaking,&quot; or partially covering, the thumb hole to destabilise low harmonics. This allows higher harmonics to sound at lower air pressures than by over-blowing alone, as on simple whistles. The player may also leak other holes to destabilise lower harmonics in place of the thumb hole (hole 0). This technique is demonstrated in the fingering tables of Ganassi&#x27;s &quot;Fontegara&quot; (1535), which illustrate the simultaneous leaking of holes 0, 2, and 5 to produce some high notes. For example, Ganassi&#x27;s table produces the 15th (third octave tonic) as the fourth harmonic of the tonic, leaking holes 0, 2 and 5 and produces the 16th as the third harmonic of the fifth, leaking holes 0 and 2. On some Baroque recorders, the 17th can be produced as the third harmonic of the sixth, leaking hole 0 as well as hole 1, 2 or both.

==Technique==
Although the design of the recorder has changed over its 700-year history, notably in fingering and bore profile (see History), the technique of playing recorders of different sizes and periods is much the same. Indeed, much of what is known about the technique of playing the recorder is derived from historical treatises and manuals dating from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries. The following describes the commonalities of recorder technique across all time periods.

=== Playing position ===
In normal playing position, the recorder is held with both hands, covering the fingerholes or depressing the keys with the pads of the fingers: four fingers on the lower hand, and the index, middle and ring fingers and thumb on the upper hand. In standard modern practice, the right hand is the lower hand, while the left hand is the upper hand, although this was not standardised before the modern revival of the recorder.

The recorder is supported by the lips, which loosely seal around the beak of the instrument, the thumb of the lower hand, and, depending on the note fingered, by the other fingers and the upper thumb. A practice documented in many historical fingering charts is the use of finger seven or eight to support the recorder when playing notes for which the coverage of this hole negligibly affects the sounding pitch (e.g. notes with many holes uncovered). Larger recorders may have a thumb rest, or a neck strap for extra support, and may use a bocal to direct air from the player&#x27;s mouth to the windway.

Recorders are typically held at an angle between vertical and horizontal, the attitude depending on the size and weight of the recorder, and personal preference.

=== Fingers ===

Pitches are produced on the recorder by covering the holes while blowing into the instrument. Modern terminology refers to the holes on the front of the instrument using the numbers 1 through 7, starting with the hole closest to the beak, with the thumbhole numbered hole 0. At the most basic level, the fingering technique of the recorder involves the sequential uncovering of the holes from lowest to highest (i.e., uncovering 7, then uncovering 7 and 6, then uncovering 7, 6 and 5, etc.) producing even higher pitches. In practice, however, the uncovering of the holes is not strictly sequential, and the half covering or uncovering of holes is an essential part of recorder technique.

==== Forked fingerings ====
A forked fingering is a fingering in which an open hole has covered holes below it: fingerings for which the uncovering of the holes is not sequential. For example, the fingering 0123 (G5) is not a forked fingering, while 0123 56 (F5) is a forked fingering because the open hole 4 has holes covered below it holes 5 and 6. Forked fingerings allow for smaller adjustments in pitch than the sequential uncovering of holes alone would allow. For example, at the same air speed the fingering 0123 5 sounds higher than 01234 but lower than 0123. Many standard recorder fingerings are forked fingerings. Forked fingerings may also be used to produce microtonal variations in pitch.

Forked fingerings have a different harmonic profile from non-forked fingerings, and are generally regarded as having a weaker sound. Forked fingerings that have a different tone color or are slightly sharp or flat can provide so-called &quot;alternate fingerings&quot;. For example, the fingering 0123 has a slightly sharper forked variant 012 4567.

==== Partial covering of holes ====
Partial covering of the holes is an essential part of the playing technique of all recorders. This is variously known as &quot;leaking&quot;, &quot;shading&quot;, &quot;half-holing&quot;, and in the context of the thumb hole, &quot;pinching&quot;.

The primary function of the thumbhole is to serve as an octaving vent. When it is leaked, the first mode of vibration of the air column becomes unstable: i.e., the register changes. In most recorders, this is required for the playing of every note higher than a ninth above the lowest note. The player must adjust the position of the thumb for these notes to sound stable and in tune.

The partial opening of the thumbhole may be achieved by sliding or rolling the thumb off the hole, or by bending the thumb at the first knuckle. To partially uncover a covered hole, the player may slide the finger off the hole, bend or roll the finger away from the hole, gently lift the finger from the hole, or a combination of these. To partially cover an open hole, the reverse is possible.

Generally speaking, the partial opening of covered fingerholes raises the pitch of the sounding note while the partial closure of open fingerholes lowers the pitch.

==== Holes 6 and 7 ====
On most &quot;baroque&quot; modelled modern recorders, the lower two fingers of the lower hand actually cover two holes each (called &quot;double holes&quot;). Whereas on the vast majority of baroque recorders and all earlier recorders these two fingers covered a single hole (&quot;single holes&quot;), double holes have become standard for baroque modelled modern recorders. By covering one or both of these two, smaller holes, a recorder player can play the notes a semitone above the lowest note and a minor third above the lowest note, notes that are possible on single holed recorders only through the partial covering of those holes, or the covering of the bell.

==== Covering the bell ====
The open end of the bore facing away from the player (the &quot;bell&quot;) may be covered to produce extra notes or effects. Because both hands are typically engaged in holding the recorder or covering the finger holes, the covering of the bell is normally achieved by bringing the end of the recorder in contact with the leg or knee, typically achieved through a combination of bending of the torso and/or raising of the knee. Alternatively, in rare cases instruments may be equipped with a key designed to cover the bell (&quot;bell key&quot;), operated by one of the fingers, typically the pinky finger of the upper hand, which is not normally used to cover a hole. Fingerings with a covered bell extend the recorder&#x27;s chromatic playable range above and below the nominal fingered range.

=== Air ===
The pitch and volume of the recorder sound are influenced by the speed of the air travelling through the windway, which may be controlled by varying the breath pressure and the shape of the vocal tract. The sound is also affected by the turbulence of the air entering the recorder. Generally speaking, faster air in the windway produces a higher pitch. Thus blowing harder causes a note to sound sharp whereas blowing the note gently causes it to sound flat. Knowledge of this fact and the recorder&#x27;s individual tonal differences over its full range will help recorders play in tune with other instruments by knowing which notes will need slightly more or less air to stay in tune. As mentioned above at &quot;Harmonic profile&quot;, blowing much harder can result in overblowing.

==== Breath ====
The technique of inhalation and exhalation for the recorder differs from that of many other wind instruments in that the recorder requires very little air pressure to produce a sound, unlike reed or brasswind instruments. Thus, it is often necessary for a recorder player to produce long, controlled streams of air at a very low pressure. Recorder breathing technique focuses on the controlled release of air rather than on maintaining diaphragmatic pressure.

==== Tongue, mouth and throat ====
The use of the tongue to stop and start the air is called &quot;articulation&quot;. In this capacity, the tongue has two basic functions: to control the start of the note (the attack) and the end, or the length of the note (legato, staccato). Articulations are roughly analogous to consonants. Practically any consonant that may be produced with the tongue, mouth, and throat may be used to articulate on the recorder. Transliterations of common articulation patterns include &quot;du du du du&quot; (using the tip of the tongue, &quot;single tonguing&quot;), &quot;du gu du gu&quot; (alternating between the tip and the back of the tongue, &quot;double tonguing&quot;), and &quot;du g&#x27;ll du g&#x27;ll&quot; (articulation with the tip and the sides of the tongue, &quot;triple tonguing&quot;). The attack of the note is governed by such factors as the pressure buildup behind the tongue and shape of the articulant, while the length of the note governed by the stoppage of the air by the tongue. Each articulation pattern has a different natural pattern of attack and length, and recorder technique seeks to produce a wide variety of lengths and attacks using these articulation patterns. Patterns such as these have been used since at least the time of Ganassi (1535).

Mouth and throat shapes are roughly analogous to vowels. The shape of the vocal tract affects the velocity and turbulence of the air entering the recorder. The shape of the mouth and vocal tract is closely related to the consonant used to articulate.

=== Coordination ===
The player must coordinate fingers and tongue to align articulations with finger movements. In normal play, articulated attacks should align with the proper fingering, even in legato passages or in difficult finger transitions and the fingers move in the brief silence between the notes (silence d&#x27;articulation) created by the stoppage of the air by the tongue.

Both fingers and the breath can be used to control the pitch of the recorder. Coordinating the two is essential to playing the recorder in tune and with a variety of dynamics and timbres. On an elementary level, breath pressure and fingerings must accord with each other to provide an in-tune pitch. As an example of a more advanced form of coordination, a gradual increase in breath pressure combined with the shading of holes, when properly coordinated, results in an increase in volume and change in tone color without a change in pitch. The reverse is possible, decreasing breath pressure and gradually lifting fingers.

===Basic fingering===

● means to cover the hole. ○ means to uncover the hole. ◐ means half-cover.
The range of a modern &quot;baroque&quot; model recorder is usually considered two octaves and a tone. See the table above for &quot;English&quot; fingerings for the standard range. The numbers at the top correspond to the fingers and the holes on the recorder. The vast majority of recorders manufactured today are designed to play using these fingerings, with slight variations. Nonetheless, recorder fingerings vary widely between models and are mutable even for a single recorder: recorder players may use three or more fingerings for the same note along with partial covering of the holes to achieve proper intonation, in coordination with the breath or in faster passages where some fingerings are unavailable. This chart is a general guide, but by no means a definitive or complete fingering chart for the recorder, an impossible task. Rather, it is the basis for a much more complex fingering system, which is still being added to today.

Some fonts show miniature glyphs of complete recorder fingering charts in TrueType format. Because there are no Unicode values for complete recorder fingering charts, these fonts are custom encoded.

== History ==

=== General ===
Duct flutes and recorders are found in almost every musical tradition around the world. The earliest extant duct flutes date to the neolithic period. While classifying early instruments has proved controversial, recorders are typically distinguished from other duct flutes by the thumb hole—used as an octaving vent—and seven finger holes. The playing of the recorder in its earliest history is not well documented owing to the lack of surviving records from the time.

=== Middle Ages ===

==== Structure ====
Our present knowledge of the shape and structure of recorders in the Middle Ages is based on the few instruments now preserved, and on artworks, including iconography, from the period.

===== Surviving instruments =====
Recorders surviving from the Middle Ages are heterogeneous. The first instrument discovered is the &quot;Dordrecht recorder&quot;. Made of fruitwood, it was excavated in 1940 from a well (not a moat) in the ruin of the &quot;Huis te Merwede&quot; (&quot;House on the Merwede&quot;), near the town of Dordrecht in the Netherlands. As the house was inhabited only from 1335 to 1418, and the site was not disturbed until the modern excavation, so the recorder has been dated to the period of occupation. 

The instrument itself presents a cylindrical bore of diameter about ; and it is about long with a vibrating air column of about . The block has survived but the labium is damaged, making the instrument unplayable. There are &quot;tenons&quot; on both ends of the instrument, suggesting the presence of &quot;ferrules&quot; (or &quot;turnings&quot;), now lost. Uncertainty about details of these fittings has hindered reconstruction of the instrument&#x27;s original state.

A structurally different instrument (the &quot;Göttingen recorder&quot;) was discovered in 1987 in an archaeological excavation of the latrine of a medieval house dated to between 1246 and 1322 in Göttingen, Germany. It is fruitwood of one piece with turnings measuring about long. It presents a cylindrical bore growing to at the second highest measurable point, then progressively narrowing to the seventh finger hole, before &quot;flaring&quot; again to at the bottom of the instrument, which has a bulbous foot. Unusually, the finger holes taper conically outwards, the opposite of the undercutting found in later Baroque recorders. 

The top of the instrument is damaged; only a cut side of the windway survives and the block has been lost. A reconstruction model by Hans Reiners produces a strident, penetrating sound rich in overtones, and has a range of two octaves. With the thumb hole and the first three finger holes covered, the reconstruction produces a pitch of ca. 450 Hz.

More instruments and fragments dated to the medieval period have come to light in the 21st century. These include: a 14th century headjoint fragment excavated in Esslingen, Germany (the &quot;Esslingen fragment&quot;); a birch instrument dated to the second half of the 14th century, unearthed in Tartu, Estonia (the &quot;Tartu recorder&quot;); and the &quot;Elbląg recorder&quot;, a fruitwood instrument dated to the 15th century, as found in Elbląg, Poland.

Common features of surviving instruments include: a narrow cylindrical bore (except the Göttingen recorder); a doubled seventh hole for the little finger of the lower hand, (except the Tartu recorder), which feature allows for both right- or left-handed playing; a flat or truncated head instead of the narrow beak found on later instruments; and a seventh hole that produces a semitone instead of a tone. Additionally, the Esslingen fragment has turnings similar to the Göttingen recorder. No complete instrument longer than has been uncovered, although the Esslingen fragment may represent a larger recorder.

The widely-spaced doubled seventh hole was problematic, and persisted into later instruments and later periods—the hole not used was plugged with wax, according to Virdung (1511). It was during the Baroque period that instruments with adjustable footjoints were developed, rendering the doubled holes obsolete.

Classifying dart flute instruments is further complicated by recorders with seventh holes that produce a semitone instead of a tone. Chromatic fingerings then are difficult, requiring extensive &quot;half-holing&quot;. Such instruments share similarities with the six-holed flageolet, which used three fingers on each hand, but with &quot;no thumb hole&quot;. Anthony Rowland-Jones suggested the recorder&#x27;s thumb hole was (intended as) an improvement over the flageolet, providing stronger fingering for the note one octave above the tonic, while the seventh finger hole provided a leading tone to the tonic. As a result, he suggests describing these flutes instead as &quot;improved flageolets&quot;, and proposes that &quot;true recorders&quot; should produce a full tone (rather than a semitone) when the seventh finger is lifted. 

Controversies aside, these instruments very likely are, at least, precursors to later instruments that indisputably are duct flute recorders. Consensus is unlikely as there is sparse documentary evidence from the earliest history of the instrument. Historically, there was no need for an all-inclusive definition that encompassed every form of the instrument past and present.

===== Iconography =====
Recorders with a cylindrical profile are depicted in many medieval paintings; however, their representions appear stylised, and do not easily correspond to surviving instruments. The earliest depiction of the recorder is probably in &quot;The Mocking of Christ&quot;, a painting from the monastery church of St George in Staro Nagoričano near Kumanovo, Macedonia, in which a man is playing a cylindrical recorder. (The painting of the church began in 1315.) And there is the center pan el of the &quot;Virgin and Child&quot;, attributed to Pedro (Pere) Serra (c. 1390), as painted for the church of Santa Clara, Tortosa, Spain and now in the Museu Nacional d&#x27;Art de Catalunya, Barcelona—a group of angels gathered around the Virgin Mary, playing musical instruments, one of them playing a cylindrical recorder.

Starting in the Middle Ages, angels have frequently been depicted as playing one or more recorders, often grouped around the Virgin; and, in several notable paintings, &quot;trios&quot; of angels play recorders. Such is perhaps a sign of the trinity, although perhaps of the music itself, which also was typically in three parts.

==== Repertoire ====
No music marked for the recorder survives from prior to 1500. Groups, particularly trios, of flutists playing recorders and of &quot;angels&quot; playing recorders, are depicted in paintings from the 15th century, indicating the recorder was used in these configurations and with other instruments. Some of the earliest music must have been vocal repertory. 

Modern recorder players have taken up playing instrumental music, some anachronistically, from the period—such as the monophonic &quot;estampies&quot; (prints) from the Chansonnier du Roi (13th century), the British Library&#x27;s Add MS 29987 (14th or 15th century), or the Codex Faenza (15th century). And they have arranged keyboard music of the period for recorder ensembles, including the estampies from the Robertsbridge codex (14th century), or the vocal works of composers Guillaume de Machaut, Johannes Ciconia, and others.

===Renaissance===
In the sixteenth century, the structure, repertoire, and performing practice of the recorder is better documented than in prior epochs. The recorder was one of the most important wind instruments of the Renaissance, and many instruments dating to the sixteenth century survive, including some matched consorts. This period also produced the first extant books describing the recorder, including the treatises of Virdung (1511), Agricola (1529), Ganassi (1535), Cardano (c.1546), Jambe de Fer (1556), and Praetorius (1619). Nonetheless, understanding of the instrument and its practice in this period is still developing.

==== Structure ====
In the sixteenth century, the recorder saw important developments in its structure. As in the recorders of the Middle Ages, the etiology of these changes remains uncertain, development was regional and multiple types of recorder existed simultaneously. Our knowledge is based on documentary sources and surviving instruments.

===== Surviving instruments =====
Far more recorders survive from the Renaissance than from the Middle Ages. Most of the surviving instruments from the period have a wide, cylindrical bore from the blockline to the uppermost fingerhole, an inverted conical portion down to around the lowest finger hole (the &quot;choke&quot;), then a slight flare to the bell. Externally, they have a curved shape similar to the bore, with a profile like a stretched hourglass. Their sound is warm, rich in harmonics, and somewhat introverted. Surviving consorts of this type, identified by their makers marks, include those marked &quot;HIER S•&quot; or &quot;HIE•S&quot; found in Vienna, Sibiu and Verona; and those marked with variations on a rabbit&#x27;s footprint, designated &quot;!!&quot; by Adrian Brown, which are dispersed among various museums. The pitch of these recorders is often generally grouped around A = 466 Hz, however little pitch standardisation existed in the period. This type of recorder is described by Praetorius in &quot;De Organographia&quot; (1619). A surviving consort by &quot;!!&quot; follows the exact size configuration suggested by Praetorius: stacked fifths up from the basset in F3, and down a fifth then a fourth to bass in B2 and great bass in F2. Instruments marked &quot;HIER S•&quot; or &quot;HIE•S&quot; are in stacked fifths from great bass in F2 to soprano in E5. Many of these instruments are pitched around A = 440 Hz or A = 466 Hz, although pitch varied regionally and between consorts.

The range of this type is normally an octave plus a minor 7th, but as remarked by Praetorius (1619) and demonstrated in the fingering tables of Ganassi&#x27;s &quot;Fontegara&quot; (1535), experienced players on particular instruments were capable of playing up to a fourth or even a seventh higher (see #Documentary evidence: treatises). Their range is more suitable for the performance of vocal music, rather than purely instrumental music. This type is the recorder typically referred to as the &quot;normal&quot; Renaissance recorder, however this modern appellation does not fully capture the heterogeneity of instruments of the sixteenth century.

Another surviving Renaissance type has a narrow cylindrical bore and cylindrical profile like the medieval exemplars but a choke at the last hole. The earliest surviving recorders of this type were made by the Rafi family, instrument makers active in Lyons in Southern France in the early sixteenth century. Two recorders marked &quot;C.RAFI&quot; were acquired by the Accademia Filarmonica, Bologna in 1546, where they remain today. A consort of recorders or similar make, marked &quot;P.GRE/C/E,&quot; was donated to the Accademia in 1675, expanding the pair marked &quot;C.RAFI&quot;. Other recorders by the Rafi family survive in Northern Europe, notably a pair in Brussels. It is possible that Grece worked in the Rafi workshop, or was a member of the Rafi family. The pitch of the Rafi/Grece instruments is around A = 440 Hz. They have a relatively quiet sound with good pitch stability favouring dynamic expression.

In 1556, French author Philibert Jambe de Fer gave a set of fingerings for hybrid instruments such as the Rafi and Grece instruments that give a range of two octaves. Here, the 15th was now produced, as on most later recorders, as a variant of the 14th instead of as the fourth harmonic of the tonic, as in Ganassi&#x27;s tables.

===== Documentary evidence: treatises =====

The first two treatises of the sixteenth century show recorders that differ from the surviving instruments dating to the century: these are Sebastian Virdung&#x27;s (b. 1465?) (1511), and Martin Agricola&#x27;s (1486–1556) similar (1529), published in Basel and Saxony respectively.

, the earliest printed treatise on western musical instruments, is an extract of an earlier, now lost, manuscript treatise by Virdung, a chaplain, singer, and itinerant musician. The printed version was written in a vernacular form of Early New High German, and was aimed at wealthy urban amateur musicians: the title translates, briefly, as &quot;Music, translated into German ... Everything there is to know about [music] – made simple.&quot; When a topic become too complex for Virdung to discuss briefly, he refers the reader to his lost larger work, an unhelpful practice for modern readers. While the illustrations have been called &quot;maddeningly inaccurate&quot; and his perspectives quirky, Virdung&#x27;s treatise gives us an important source on the structure and performing practice of the recorder in northern Europe in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries.

The recorders described by Virdung have cylindrical profiles with flat heads, narrow windows and long ramps, ring-like turnings on the feet, and a slight external flare at the bell (above, far left and middle left). Virdung depicts four recorders together: a or (basset) in F3 with an anchor shaped key and a perforated fontanelle, two tenors in C4 and a (alto) in G4. According to Virdung, the configurations F–C–C–G or F–C–G–G should be used for four-part music, depending on the range of the bass part. As previously mentioned, the accuracy of these woodcuts cannot be verified as no recorders fitting this description survive. Virdung also provides the first ever fingering chart for a recorder with a range of an octave and a seventh, though he says that the bass had a range of only an octave and sixth. In his fingering chart, he numbers which fingers to lift rather than those to put down and, unlike in later charts, numbers them from bottom (1) to top (8). His only other technical instruction is that the player must blow into the instrument and &quot;learn how to coordinate the articulations ... with the fingers&quot;.

Martin Agricola&#x27;s (&quot;A German instrumental music, in which is contained how to learn to play ... all kinds of ... instruments&quot;), written in rhyming German verse (ostensibly to improve the understanding and retention of its contents), provides a similar account and copies most of its woodcuts directly from . Agricola also calls the tenor &quot;altus,&quot; mistakenly depicting it as a little smaller than the tenor in the woodcut (above, middle right). Like Virdung, Agricola takes it for granted that recorders should be played in four-part consorts. Unlike , which provides a single condensed fingering chart, Agricola provides separate, slightly differing, fingering charts for each instrument, leading some to suppose that Agricola experimented on three different instruments, rather than copying the fingerings from one size to the other two. Agricola adds that graces (), which make the melody , must be learned from a professional (), and that the manner of ornamentation () of the organist is best of all. A substantial 1545 revision of approvingly mentions the use of vibrato () for woodwind instruments, and includes an account of articulation, recommending the syllables &#x27; for semiminims and larger, &#x27; for semiminims and smaller, and the articulation &quot;&quot;, which he calls the &quot;flutter-tongue&quot; () for the smallest of note values, found in &quot;passagi (Colorirn)&quot;.

The next treatise comes from Venice: Silvestro Ganassi dal Fontego&#x27;s (1492–mid-1500s) &quot;Opera Intitulata Fontegara&quot; (1535), which is the first work to focus specifically on the technique of playing the recorder, and perhaps the only historical treatise ever published that approaches a description of a professional or virtuoso playing technique. Ganassi was a musician employed by the Doge and at the Basilica di San Marco at the time of the work&#x27;s publication, an indication of his high level of accomplishment, and later wrote two works on the playing the viol and the violone, although he does not mention being employed by the Doge after &quot;Fontegara&quot;.

&quot;Fontegara&quot; can be broadly divided into two parts: the first concerns the technique of playing the recorder, the second demonstrated divisions (regole, passagi, ornaments), some of great complexity, which the player may use to ornament a melody or, literally, &quot;divide&quot; it into smaller notes. In all aspects, Ganassi emphasises the importance of imitating the human voice, declaring that &quot;the aim of the recorder player is to imitate as closely as possible all the capabilities of the human voice&quot;, maintaining that the recorder is indeed able to do this. For Ganassi, imitation of the voice has three aspects: &quot;a certain artistic proficiency,&quot; which seems to be the ability to perceive the nature of the music, (dexterity or fluency), achieved &quot;by varying the pressure of the breath and shading the tone by means of suitable fingering,&quot; and (elegance or grace), achieved by articulation, and by the use of ornaments, the &quot;simplest ingredient&quot; of them being the trill, which varies according to the expression.

Ganassi gives fingering tables for a range of an octave and a seventh, the standard range also remarked by Praetorius, then tells the reader that he has discovered, through long experimentation, more notes not known to other players due to their lack of perseverance, extending the range to two octaves and a sixth. Ganassi gives fingerings for three recorders with different makers&#x27; marks, and advises the reader to experiment with different fingerings, as recorders vary in their bore. The maker&#x27;s mark of one of the recorders, in the form of a stylised letter &quot;A&quot;, has been associated with the Schnitzer family of instrument makers in Germany, leading Hermann Moeck to suppose that Ganassi&#x27;s recorder might have been Northern European in origin. (see also Note on &quot;Ganassi&quot; recorders)

Ganassi uses three basic kinds of syllables &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27; and also varies the vowel used with the syllable, suggesting the effect of mouth shape on the sound of the recorder. He gives many combinations of these syllables and vowels, and suggests the choice of the syllables according to their smoothness, &#x27; being least smooth and &quot;&quot; being most so. He does not, however, demonstrate how the syllables should be used to music.

Most of the treatise consists of tables of diminutions of intervals, small melodies and cadences, categorised by their meter. These several hundred divisions use quintuplets, septuplets, note values from whole notes to 32nd notes in modern notation, and demonstrate immense variety and complexity.

The frontispiece to &quot;Fontegara&quot; shows three recorder players play together with two singers. Like Agricola and Virdung, Ganassi takes for granted that recorders should be played in groups of four, and come in three sizes: F3, C4 and G4. He makes a distinction between solo playing and ensemble playing, noting that what he has said is for solo players, and that when playing with others, it is most important to match them. Unfortunately, Ganassi gives only a few ornamented examples with little context for their use. Nonetheless, Ganassi offers a tantalising glimpse at a highly developed professional culture and technique of woodwind playing that modern players can scarcely be said to have improved upon.

Gerolamo Cardano&#x27;s &quot;De Musica&quot; was written around 1546, but not published until 1663 when it was published along with other works by Cardan, who was an eminent philosopher, mathematician and physician as well as a keen amateur recorder player who learned from a professional teacher, Leo Oglonus, as a child in Milan.

His account corroborates that of Ganassi, using the same three basic syllables and emphasising the importance of breath control and ornamentation in recorder playing, but also documents several aspects of recorder technique otherwise undocumented until the twentieth century. These include multiple techniques using the partial closing of the bell: to produce a tone or semitone below the tonic, and to change semitones into dieses (half semitones), which he says can also be produced by &quot;repercussively bending back the tongue&quot;. He also adds that the position of the tongue, either extended or turned up towards the palate, can be used to improve, vary, and color notes. He is the first to differentiate between the amount of the breath (full, shallow, or moderate) and the force (relaxed or slow, intense, and the median between them) as well as the different amount of air required for each instrument, and describes a trill or vibrato called a in which &quot;a tremulous quality in the breath&quot; is combined with a trilling of the fingers to vary the interval from anything between a major third and a diesis. He is also the first writer to mention the recorder in D (&quot;discantus&quot;), which he leaves unnamed.

Composer and singer Philibert Jambe de Fer ( 1515 1566) was the only French author of the sixteenth century to write about the recorder, in his &quot;Epitome musical&quot;. He complains of the French name for the instrument, (&#x27;flute with nine holes&#x27;) as, in practice, one of the lowermost holes must be plugged, leaving only eight open holes. He prefers or the Italian . His fingering chart is notable for two reasons, first for describing fingerings with the 15th produced as a variant on the 14th, and for using the third finger of the lower hand as a buttress finger, although only for three notes in the lower octave. (See also Renaissance structure.)

Aurelio Virgiliano&#x27;s &quot;&quot; ( 1600) presents ricercars intended for or playable on the recorder, a description of other musical instruments, and a fingering chart for a recorder in G4 similar to Jambe de Fer&#x27;s.

The &quot;Syntagma musicum&quot; (1614–20) of Michael Praetorius (1571–1621) in three volumes (a fourth was intended but never finished) is an encyclopaedic survey of music and musical instruments. Volume II, &quot;De Organographia&quot; (1619) is of particular interest for its description of no fewer than eight sizes of recorder ( or &quot;exilent&quot; in G5, &quot;discant&quot; in C5 or D5, &quot;alt&quot; in G4, &quot;tenor&quot; in C4, &quot;basset&quot; in F3, &quot;bass&quot; in B2, and in F2) as well as the four-holed .

Praetorius was the first author to explain that recorders can confuse the ear into believing that they sound an octave lower than pitch, which phenomenon has more recently been explained in relation to the recorder&#x27;s lack of high harmonics. He also shows the different &quot;registers&quot; of consort possible, 2′ (discant, alt, and tenor), 4′ (alt, tenor, and basset), and 8′ (tenor, basset, and bass) (see also Nomenclature). Additionally, he proposed cutting the recorder between the beak and the first finger hole to allow for a kind of tuning slide to raise or lower its pitch, similar to the Baroque practice of adjusting a recorder&#x27;s pitch by &quot;pulling out&quot; the top joint of the recorder.

The recorders described in Praetorius are of the &quot;stretched hourglass&quot; profile (see above, far right). He gives fingerings like those of Ganassi, and remarks that they normally have a range of an octave and a sixth, although exceptional players could extend that range by a fourth.

===== &quot;Double recorder&quot; =====

Some paintings from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries depict musicians playing what appear to be two end-blown flutes simultaneously. In some cases, the two flutes are evidently disjoint, separate flutes of similar make, played angled away from each other, one pipe in each hand. In others, flutes of the same length have differing hand positions. In a final case, the pipes are parallel, in contact with each other, and differ in length. While the iconographic criteria for a recorder are typically a clearly recognisable labium and a double handed vertical playing technique, such criteria are not prescriptive, and it is uncertain whether any of these depictions should be considered a single instrument, or constitute a kind of recorder. The identification of the instrument depicted is further complicated by the symbolism of the aulos, a double piped instrument associated with the satyr Marsyas of Greek mythology.

An instrument consisting of two attached, parallel, end-blown flutes of differing length, dating to the fifteenth or sixteenth century, was found in poor condition near All Souls College in Oxford. The instrument has four holes finger-holes and a thumb hole for each hand. The pipes have an inverted conical &quot;choke&quot; bore (see Renaissance structure). Bob Marvin has estimated that the pipes played a fifth apart, at approximately C5 and G5. The instrument is sui generis. Although the instrument&#x27;s pipes have thumb holes, the lack of organological precedent makes classification of the instrument difficult. Marvin has used the terms &quot;double recorder&quot; and the categorisation-agnostic (double flute) to describe the Oxford instrument.

Marvin has designed a based on the Oxford instrument, scaled to play at F4 and C5. Italian recorder maker Francesco Livirghi has designed a double recorder or with connected, angled pipes of the same length but played with different hand positions, based on iconographic sources. Its pipes play at F4 and B4. Both instruments use fingerings of the makers&#x27; design.

===== Note on &quot;Ganassi&quot; recorders =====
In the 1970s, when recorder makers began to make the first models of recorders from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, such models were not always representative of the playing characteristics of the original instruments. Especially notable is Fred Morgan&#x27;s much copied &quot;Ganassi&quot; model, based loosely on an instrument in the Vienna Kunsthistorisches museum (inventory number SAM 135), which was designed to use the fingerings for the highest notes in Ganassi&#x27;s tables in Fontegara. As Morgan knew, these notes were not in standard use; indeed Ganassi uses them in only a few of the hundreds of diminutions contained in Fontegara. Historically, such recorders did not exist as a distinct type, and the fingerings given by Ganassi were those of a skilled player particularly familiar with his instruments. When modern music is written for &#x27;Ganassi recorders&#x27; it means this type of recorder.

==== Repertoire ====
Recorders were probably first used to play vocal music, later adding purely instrumental forms such as dance music to their repertoire. Much of the vocal music of the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries can be played on recorder consorts, and as illustrated in treatises from Virdung to Praetorius, the choice appropriate instruments and transpositions to play vocal music was common practice in the Renaissance. Additionally, some collections such as those of Pierre Attaingnant and Anthony Holborne, indicate that their instrumental music was suitable for recorder consorts. This section first discusses repertoire marked for the recorder, then briefly, other repertoire played on recorder.

In 1505 Giovanni Alvise, a Venetian wind player, offered Francesco Gonzaga of Mantua a motet for eight recorders, however the work has not survived.

Pierre Attaingnant&#x27;s ( 1528–1549) (1533) collects 28 (not 27, as in the title) four-part instrumental motets, nine of which he says were suitable for performance on flutes (, German flutes), two on recorders (&quot;,&quot; nine-holed flutes, &quot;recorders&quot;), and twelve suitable for both. Of the twelve marked for both, seven use &quot;chiavi naturali&quot;, or low-clefs typically used for recorders, while the others use the clefs used in the motets marked for flutes. Hence, the seven notated in could be considered more appropriate for recorders. is the first published music marked for a recorder consort. Earlier is a part for Jacobus Barbireau&#x27;s song &quot;&quot;, apparently for recorder, accompanying the recorder fingering chart in &quot;...&quot; (Antwerp, 1529), a partial French translation of Virdung&#x27;s .

Jacques Moderne&#x27;s published in the 1530s, depicts a four-part recorder consort such as those described in Virdung, Agricola, Ganassi and others, however the dances are not marked for recorders. His (1550) contains ricercares and dances for performance on &quot;, &amp; &quot;.

In 1539–40, Henry VIII of England, also a keen amateur player (see Cultural significance), imported five brothers of the Bassano family from Venice to form a consort, expanded to six members in 1550, forming a group that maintained an exceptional focus on the recorder until at least 1630 when the recorder consort was combined with the other wind groups. Most wind bands consisted of players playing sackbutts, shawms, and other loud instruments doubling on recorder. Some music probably intended for this group survives, including dance music by Augustine and Geronimo Bassano from the third quarter of the sixteenth century, and the more elaborate fantasias of Jeronimo Bassano ( 1580), four in five parts and one in six parts. Additionally, the Fitzwilliam wind manuscript (&quot;GB-Cfm&quot; 734) contains wordless motets, madrigals and dance pieces, including some by the Bassano family, probably intended for a recorder consort in six parts.

The English members of the Bassano family, having originated in Venice, were also probably familiar with the vocal style, advanced technique, and complex improvised ornamentation described in Ganassi&#x27;s &quot;Fontegara&quot;, and they were probably among the recorder players whom Ganassi reports having worked and studied with: when they were brought to England, they were regarded as some of the best wind players in Venice. While most of the music attributed to the consort uses only a range of a thirteenth, it is possible that the Bassano&#x27;s were familiar with Ganassi&#x27;s extended range.

Recorders were also played with other instruments, especially in England, where it was called a mixed consort or &quot;broken consort&quot;.

Other sixteenth-century composers whose instrumental music can be played well on recorder consorts include:
* Anthony Holborne (c. 15451602)
* Tielman Susato (c. 1510c. 1570)
Other notable composers of the Renaissance whose music may be played on the recorder include:
* Guillaume Dufay (13971474)
* Johannes Ockeghem (1410/14251497)
* Josquin des Prez (1450/14551521)
* Heinrich Isaac (14501517)
* Ludwig Senfl (1486c. 1542)
* Orlando di Lasso (c. 15301594)
* William Byrd (c. 15391623)
* John Dowland (15631626)

==== Cultural significance ====
The recorder was widely used in the sixteenth century, and was one of the most common instruments of the Renaissance. From the fifteenth century onwards, paintings show upper-class men and women playing recorder, and Virdung&#x27;s didactic treatise (1511), the first of its kind, was aimed at the amateur (see also Documentary evidence). Henry VIII was a recorder player; at his death in 1547 an inventory of his possessions included 76 recorders in consorts of various sizes and materials. Some Italian paintings from the sixteenth century show aristocracy of both sexes playing the recorder, however many gentlemen found it unbecoming to play because it uses the mouth, preferring the lute and later the viol.

Shakespeare mentions the recorder in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, written at the turn of the seventeenth century, as does Milton in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; published in 1667, in which fallen angels in Hell &quot;move / in perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood / of flutes and soft recorders&quot;.

===Baroque recorders===
==== Structure ====
Several changes in the construction of recorders took place in the seventeenth century, resulting in the type of instrument generally referred to as &quot;Baroque&quot; recorders, as opposed to the earlier &quot;Renaissance&quot; recorders. These innovations allowed baroque recorders to possess a tone regarded as &quot;sweeter&quot; than that of the earlier instruments, at the expense of a reduction in volume, particularly in the lowest notes.

The evolution of the Renaissance recorder into the Baroque instrument is generally attributed to the Hotteterre family, in France. They developed the ideas of a more tapered bore, bringing the finger-holes of the lowermost hand closer together, allowing greater range, and enabling the construction of instruments in several jointed sections. The last innovation allowed more accurate shaping of each section and also offered the player minor tuning adjustments, by slightly pulling out one of the sections to lengthen the instrument.

The French innovations were taken to London by Pierre Bressan, a set of whose instruments survive in the Grosvenor Museum, Chester, as do other examples in various American, European and Japanese museums and private collections. Bressan&#x27;s contemporary, Thomas Stanesby, was born in Derbyshire but became an instrument maker in London. He and his son (Thomas Stanesby junior) were the other important British-based recorder-makers of the early eighteenth century.

In continental Europe, the Denner family of Nuremberg were the most celebrated makers of this period.

The baroque recorder produces a most brilliant and projecting sound in the second octave, which is more facile and extended than that of earlier recorders, while the lowest notes in its range are relatively weak. Composers such as Bach, Telemann and Vivaldi exploit this property in their concertos for the instrument.

Measured from its lowest to its highest playable note, the baroque alto recorder has a range of at most two octaves and a fifth with many instruments having a smaller range. Even the most developed instruments of the period, however, cannot produce the augmented tonic, third and fourth of the third octave. Notably, Georg Philipp Telemann&#x27;s concerto TWV 51:F1 makes use some of these notes in the third octave, posing significant technical challenges to the player, perhaps requiring the covering of the bell or other unusual techniques.

==== Repertoire ====
Jacob van Eyck composed a collection of about 140 melodies, each with a number of diminutions or variations, for solo soprano recorder.

During the baroque period, the recorder was traditionally associated with pastoral scenes, miraculous events, funerals, marriages, and amorous scenes. Images of recorders can be found in literature and artwork associated with all of these. Purcell, J. S. Bach, Telemann, and Vivaldi used the recorder to suggest shepherds and imitate birds in their music.

Although the recorder achieved a greater level of standardisation in the Baroque than in previous periods, indeed it is the first period in which there was a &quot;standard&quot; size of recorder, ambiguous nomenclature and uncertain organological evidence have led to controversy regarding which instruments should be used in some &quot;flute&quot; parts from the period.

===== Fourth Brandenburg Concerto BWV 1049 =====
The concertino group of Bach&#x27;s fourth Brandenburg Concerto in G major, BWV 1049, consists of a , and , with ripieno strings. His later harpsichord transcription of this concerto, BWV 1057, lowers the key by a tone, as in all of Bach&#x27;s harpsichord transcriptions, and is scored for solo harpsichord, two and ripieno strings. The desired instrument for the parts in BWV 1049 has been a matter of perennial musicological and organological debate for two primary reasons: first, the term is not mentioned in dictionaries or tutors of the period; and second, the first part uses F#6, a note which is difficult to produce on a Baroque alto recorder in F4.

The instrumentation of BWV 1057 is uncontroversial: unambiguously specifies recorders, and both parts have been modified to fit comfortably on altos in F4, avoiding, for example, an unplayable Eb4 in the second that would have resulted from a simple transposition of a tone.

For the first and last movements of the concerto, two opinions predominate: first, that both recorder parts should be played on alto recorders in F4; and second, that the first part should be played on an alto recorder in G and the second part on an alto in F. Tushaar Power has argued for the alto in G4 on the basis that Bach uses the high F#6, which can be easily played on an alto in G4, but not the low F4, a note not playable on the alto in G4. He corroborates this with other alto recorder parts in Bach&#x27;s cantatas. Michael Marissen reads the repertoire differently, demonstrating that in other recorder parts, Bach used both the low F4 and F#6, as well as higher notes. Marissen argues that Bach was not as consistent as Power asserts, and that Bach would have almost certainly had access to only altos in F. He corroborates this with examinations of pitch standards and notation in Bach&#x27;s cantatas, in which the recorder parts are sometimes written as transposing instruments to play with organs that sounded as much as a minor third above written pitch. Marissen also reads Bach&#x27;s revisions to the recorder parts in BWV 1057 as indicative of his avoidance of F#6 in BWV 1049, a sign that he only used the difficult note when necessary in designing the part for an alto recorder in F4. He posits that Bach avoided F#6 in BWV 1049, at the cost of inferior counterpoint, reinstating them as E6 in BWV 1057.

In the second movement, breaking of beaming in the parts, markings of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;p,&quot; the fermata over the final double bar of the first movement, and the 21 bars of rest at the beginning of the third have led some musicologists to argue that Bach intended the use of &quot;echo flutes&quot; distinct from normal recorders in the second movement in particular. The breaking of beaming could be an indication of changes in register or tonal quality, the rests introduced to allow the players time to change instruments, and the markings of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;p&quot; further indicative of register or sound changes. Marissen has demonstrated that the &quot;f&quot; and &quot;p&quot; markings probably indicated tutti and solo sections rather than loud and soft ones.

A number of instruments other than normal recorders have been suggested for the . One of the earliest proposed alternatives, by Thurston Dart, was the use of double flageolets, a suggestion since revealed to be founded on unsteady musicological grounds. Dart did, however, bring to light numerous newspaper references to Paisible&#x27;s performance on an &quot;echo flute&quot; between 1713 and 1718. Another contemporary reference to the &quot;echo flute&quot; is in Etienne Loulié&#x27;s (Amsterdam, 1696): (The sounds of two echo flutes are different, because one is strong and the other is weak). Loulié is unclear on why one would need two echo flutes to play strongly and weakly, and on why it is that echo flutes differ. Perhaps the echo flute was composed in two halves: one which plays strongly, the other weakly? On this we can only speculate.

Surviving instruments which are candidates for echo flutes include an instrument in Leipzig which consists of two recorders of different tonal characteristics joined at the head and footjoints by brass flanges. There is also evidence of double recorders tuned in thirds, but these are not candidates for the parts in BWV 1049.

===== &quot;&quot; RV 443, 444, 445 =====
Vivaldi wrote three concertos for the , possibly for performance by students at the Ospedale della Pietà in Venice, where he taught and composed in the early eighteenth century. They feature virtuosic solo writing, and along with his concerto RV 441 and trio sonata RV 86 are his most virtuosic recorder works. They each survive a single hastily written manuscript copy, each titled (Concerto for little flute) with the additional note (The instruments transpose by a fourth) in RV 443 and (The instruments lower by a fourth) in RV 445. The three concertos RV 443, 444, and 445 are notated in C major, C major and A minor respectively. Also of note is the occasional use of notes outside the normal two octave compass of the recorder: the range of the solo sections is two octaves from notated F4 to notated F6, however there is a single notated C4 in the first movement of RV 444, a notated E4 in a tutti section in the first movement of RV 443 and low E4 in multiple tutti sections of RV 445.

A number of possible have been proposed as the instrument intended for the performance of these concertos. The first suggestion was the use of the one keyed piccolo, or another small transverse flute, however such instruments had fallen out of use in Venice by the generally accepted time of composition of these concertos in the 1720s, and this opinion is no longer considered well supported. Another suggestion, first proposed by Peter Thalheimer, is the &quot;French&quot; flageolet (see Flageolets below) in G5, which was notated in D4, appearing a fourth lower, possibly explaining the note in the margins of RV 443 and RV 445 () and supported by Bismantova (1677 rev. 1694) and Bonanni (1722) which equate to the flageolet. However this suggestion has been opposed by the presence of notated F and F which are not within the typical compass of the flageolet, although they may be produced through the covering of the bell, sometimes combined with underblowing, as attested by theorists as early as Cardano (c. 1546) and as late as Bellay (c. 1800).

Two instruments are conventionally accepted today for the performance of these concertos, the sopranino recorder, notated like an alto but sounding an octave higher, and the soprano recorder, following the instruction to transpose the parts down by a fourth. Winfried Michel was first to argue in favour of the soprano recorder in 1983, when he proposed to take Vivaldi at his word and transpose the string parts down a fourth and play the part on a soprano recorder in C5 (also &quot;fifth-flute&quot;) using the English practice of notating such flutes as transposing instruments using the fingerings of an alto recorder. Michel notes that this transposition allows for the use of the violins&#x27; and viola&#x27;s lowest strings (in sections where they provide the accompaniment without bass) and the lowest two notes of the &#x27;cello. He attributes the presence of notes not in the recorder&#x27;s normal compass to Vivaldi&#x27;s haste, noting that these notes do not appear in the solo sections. He has edited editions of RV 443 and RV 445 for soprano recorder in G major and E minor respectively. Federico Maria Sardelli concurs with Michel in supposing that the margin note was intended to allow the performance of the concertos on the soprano recorder on a specific occasion, however concludes that they were probably written for the sopranino recorder in F5, noting that small transverse flutes had fallen out of use in Italy by Vivaldi&#x27;s time, the paucity of flageolets in Italy, the range of the parts, and uses of the in vocal arias.

===Classical and Romantic===
The recorder was little used in art music of the Classical and Romantic periods. Researchers have long debated why this change occurred, and to what extent the recorder remained use in the late eighteenth century, and later the nineteenth century. A significant question in this debate is which, if any, duct flutes of this period are recorders or successors to recorders.

==== Repertoire ====
The recorder work of the latter half of the eighteenth century most known today is probably a trio sonata by C. P. E. Bach, Wq.163, composed in 1755an arrangement of a trio sonata for two violins and continuo, scored for the unusual ensemble of viola, bass recorder and continuo. This work is also notable for being perhaps the only significant surviving historical solo work for bass recorder. Also of note are the works of Johann Christoph Schultze ( 1733–1813), who wrote two concertos for the instrument, one in G major and another in B major, written around 1740. The last occurrences of the recorder in art music are apparently by Carl Maria von Weber in &quot;Peter Schmoll und seine Nachbarn&quot; (1801) and (1806). Hector Berlioz may have intended &quot;&quot; from &quot;L&#x27;enfance du Christ&quot; (1853) for the instrument. Donizetti owned three recorders.

==== Decline ====
Many reasons supporting the conventional view that the recorder declined have been proposed. The first significant explanation for the recorder&#x27;s decline was proposed by Waitzman (1967), who proposed six reasons:
# The recorder lacked a significant class of professional players
# The recorder&#x27;s true nature was not appreciated
# The high tessitura of the instrument discouraged composers from writing idiomatically for the instrument
# The exploitation of the highest registers posed special problems for makers and players
# Interest in clarino (4′ pitch) instruments was waning
# As a result of the first five factors, the recorder had a bad reputation, which discouraged students from studying the instrument
In the Baroque, the majority of professional recorder players were primarily oboists or string players. For this reason, the number of professional exponents of the recorder was smaller than that of other woodwinds.

Others attribute the decline of the recorder in part to the flute innovators of the time, such as Grenser, and Tromlitz, who extended the transverse flute&#x27;s range and evened out its tonal consistency through the addition of keys, or to the supposedly greater dynamic range and volume of the flute. Similar developments occurring in many other orchestral instruments to make them louder, increase their range, and increase their tonal consistency did not simultaneously occur in the case of the recorder.

A complementary view recently advanced by Nikolaj Tarasov is that the recorder, rather than totally disappearing, evolved in similar ways to other wind instruments through the addition of keys and other devices, and remained in use throughout the nineteenth century, with its direct descendant&#x27;s popularity overlapping with the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century recorder revival. Support for this view rests on the organological classification of some nineteenth century duct flutes as recorders. For more on this question, see &quot;Other duct flutes&quot;.

==== Other duct flutes ====
Duct flutes remained popular even as the recorder waned in the eighteenth century. As in the instrument&#x27;s earliest history, questions of the instrument&#x27;s quiddity are at the forefront of modern debate. The modification and renaming of recorders in the eighteenth century in order to prolong their use, and the uncertainty of the extent of the recorder&#x27;s use the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries have fuelled these debates. Some recent researchers contend that some nineteenth-century duct flutes are actually recorders. This article briefly discusses the duct flutes presented as successors to the recorder: the English flageolet and the csakan, which were popular among amateurs in the second half of the eighteenth century, and the whole of the nineteenth.

===== Flageolets =====

The word &quot;flageolet&quot; has been used since the sixteenth century to refer to small duct flutes, and the instrument is sometimes designated using general terms such as and , complicating identification of its earliest form. It was first described by Mersenne in (1636) as having four fingers holes on the front and two thumb holes on the back, with a lowest note C6 and a compass of two octaves. Like the recorder, the upper thumb hole is used as an octaving vent. Flageolets were generally small flutes; however, their lowest note varies. They were initially popular in France, and it is from there that the flageolet first arrived in England in the seventeenth century, becoming a popular amateur instrument, as the recorder later did. Indeed, when the recorder was introduced to England, it was presented as an easy instrument for those who already played the flageolet, and the earliest English recorder tutors are notated in the flageolet tablature of the time, called &quot;dot-way&quot;. Notably, the diarist and naval administrator Samuel Pepys (1633–1703) and his wife were both amateur players of the flageolet, and Pepys was later an amateur recorder player.

Starting in the early 1800s, a number of innovations were introduced to the flageolet, including the addition of keys to extend its range and allow it to more easily play accidentals. They also included solutions to the problem of condensation: most commonly, a sea sponge was placed inside the wind chamber (the conical chamber above the windway) to soak up moisture. More novel solutions such as the insertion of a thin wooden wedge into the windway, the drilling of little holes in the side of the block to drain condensation, and a complex system for draining condensation through a hollowed-out block were also developed. Around 1800 in England, the recorder (&quot;English flute,&quot; see Name) came to be called an &quot;English flageolet,&quot; appropriating the name of the more fashionable instrument. From at least this time to the present, the flageolet in its first form has been called the French flageolet to differentiate it from the so-called English flageolet.

From around 1803, when the London instrument maker William Bainbridge obtained a number of patents for improvements to the English flageolet, instruments were often referred as &quot;improved&quot; or &quot;patent&quot; flageolets with little reference to how they actually differed from their predecessors. In this period, the instrument had six finger holes and single thumb hole, and had as many as six keys. Tarasov reports that the English flageolets of the late eighteenth century had six finger holes and no thumb hole, and later regained the thumb hole and seventh finger hole (see above, right). The English flageolet never reached the level of popularity that the &quot;French&quot; flageolet enjoyed in the nineteenth century, possibly because the latter instrument was louder. Both remained popular until the beginning of the twentieth century.

A significant amount of music was written for the flageolet in the nineteenth century, such as the etudes of Narcisse Bousquet, although much of it was directed at amateurs.

English flageolets that may qualify as recorders are of two types: those early instruments, called &quot;English flageolets,&quot; which were actually recorders, and nineteenth-century instruments with seven finger holes and a thumb hole. These instruments are not typically regarded as recorders; however, Tarasov has argued for their inclusion in the family.

===== Csakan =====
The csakan (from Hung. &#x27;pickaxe&#x27;), also known by the recorder&#x27;s old French name , was a duct flute in the shape of a walking stick or oboe popular in Vienna from about 1800 to the 1840s. The csakan was played using the fingerings of a recorder in C, and was typically pitched in A or G and played as a transposing instrument. The first documented appearance of the csakan was at a concert in Budapest on 18 February 1807 in a performance by its billed inventor, Anton Heberle ( 1806–16). Tarasov has contested Heberle&#x27;s status as the inventor of the instrument, and has argued that the csakan grew out of a Hungarian war hammer of the same name, which was converted into a recorder, perhaps for playing military music. Around 1800, it was highly fashionable for make walking sticks with additional functions (e.g., umbrellas, swords, flutes, oboes, clarinets, horns) although the csakan was the most popular of these, and the only one that became a musical instrument in its own right.

The earliest instruments were shaped like a walking stick with a mouthpiece in the handle and had no keys, although they could eventually have up to thirteen keys, along with a tuning slide and a device for narrowing the thumb hole. In the 1820s a csakan &quot;in the pleasing shape of an oboe&quot; was introduced in a &quot;simple&quot; form with a single key and a &quot;complex&quot; form with up to twelve keys like those found on contemporaneous flutes. Well-known makers of the csakan included Johann Ziegler and Stephan Koch in Vienna, and Franz Schöllnast in Pressburg. According to accounts left by Schöllnast, the csakan was primarily an amateur instrument, purchased by those who wanted something simple and inexpensive, however there were also accomplished professionals, such as Viennese court oboist Ernst Krähmer (1795–1837) who toured as far afield as Russia, playing the csakan with acclaimed virtuosity.

Around 400 works for the csakan were published in the first half of the nineteenth century, mainly for csakan solo, csakan duet or csakan with guitar or piano. The csakan&#x27;s repertoire has not yet been fully explored. Notable composers for the instrument include Heberle and Krähmer, and Tarasov notes that piano works by Beethoven were arranged for csakan and guitar (Beethoven is reported to have owned a walking-stick csakan). Modern recorder makers such as Bernhard Mollenhauer and Martin Wenner have made csakan copies.

Similarities in fingering and design make the csakan at least a close relative of the recorder. Accounts of Krähmer&#x27;s playing, which report his &quot;diminishing and swelling the notes, up to an almost unbelievable loudness&quot; imply a developed technique using shading and alternate fingerings, far beyond a purely amateur culture of house music. Additionally, Tarasov reports that some recorders by Baroque makers were modified, around 1800, through the addition of keys, including a J. C. Denner (1655–1707) basset recorder in Budapest and an alto by Nikolaus Staub (1664–1734) with added G keys, like the D key on a baroque two-key flute. Another modification is the narrowing of the thumb hole, by way of an ivory plug on the J. C. Denner basset and an alto by Benedikt Gahn (1674–1711), to allow it to serve purely as an octaving vent, as found on many flageolets and csakans. These changes may be archetypal to those found on csakans and flageolets, and constitute an inchoate justification for the continuous development of the Baroque recorder into its nineteenth-century relatives.

===Modern revival===
==== The &quot;revival&quot; ====
The concept of a recorder &quot;revival&quot; must be considered in the context of the decline of the recorder in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The craft of recorder making was continued in some form by a number of families, such as the produced by the Oeggle family, which traces its lineage to the Walch family of recorder makers the careers of the Schlosser family of Zwota. Heinrich Oskar Schlosser (1875–1947) made instruments sold by the firm of Moeck in Celle and helped to design their Tuju series of recorders. The firm Mollenhauer, currently headed by Bernhard Mollenhauer, can trace its origins to historical instrument makers.

The recorder, if it did persist through the nineteenth century, did so in a manner quite unlike the success it enjoyed in previous centuries, or that it would enjoy in the century to come in. Among the earliest ensembles to begin use of recorders in the twentieth century was the Bogenhauser Künstlerkapelle (Bogenhausen Artists&#x27; Band) which from 1890 to 1939 used antique recorders and other instruments to play music of all ages, including arrangements of classical and romantic music. Nonetheless, the recorder was considered primarily an instrument of historical interest.

The eventual success of the recorder in the modern era is often attributed to Arnold Dolmetsch. While he was responsible for broadening interest in the United Kingdom beyond the small group of early music specialists, Dolmetsch was not solely responsible for the recorder&#x27;s broader revival. On the continent his efforts were preceded by those of musicians at the Brussels Conservatoire (where Dolmetsch received his training), and by the German Bogenhauser Künstlerkapelle. Also in Germany, the work of Willibald Gurlitt, Werner Danckerts and Gustav Scheck proceeded quite independently of the Dolmetsches.

==== Players ====
Carl Dolmetsch, the son of Arnold Dolmetsch, became one of the first virtuoso recorder players in the 1920s; but more importantly he began to commission recorder works from leading composers of his day, especially for performance at the Haslemere festival which his father ran. Initially as a result of this, and later as a result of the development of a Dutch school of recorder playing led by Kees Otten, the recorder was introduced to serious musicians as a virtuoso solo instrument both in Britain and in northern Europe.

Among the influential virtuosos who figure in the revival of the recorder as a serious concert instrument in the latter part of the twentieth century are Ferdinand Conrad, Kees Otten, Frans Brüggen, Roger Cotte, Hans-Martin Linde, Bernard Krainis, and David Munrow. Brüggen recorded most of the landmarks of the historical repertoire and commissioned a substantial number of new works for the recorder. Munrow&#x27;s 1975 double album &quot;The Art of the Recorder&quot; remains as an important anthology of recorder music through the ages.

Among late twentieth-century and early 21st-century recorder ensembles, the trio Sour Cream (led by Frans Brüggen), Flautando Köln, the Flanders Recorder Quartet, Amsterdam Loeki Stardust Quartet and Quartet New Generation have programmed remarkable mixtures of historical and contemporary repertoire. Soloists such as Piers Adams, Dan Laurin and Dorothee Oberlinger, Michala Petri, Maurice Steger.

In the 2012 Charlotte Barbour-Condini became the first recorder player to reach the final of the biennial BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. Recorder player Sophie Westbrooke was a finalist in the 2014 competition.

==== Structure ====

The first recorders to be played in the modern period were antique instruments from previous periods. Anecdotally, Arnold Dolmetsch was motivated to make his own recorders after losing a bag containing his antique instruments. Recorders made in the early twentieth century were imitative of baroque models in their exterior form, but differed significantly in their structure. Dolmetsch introduced English fingering, the now standard fingering for &quot;baroque&quot; model instruments, and standardised the doubled 6th and 7th holes found on a handful of antique instruments by the English makers Stanesby and Bressan. Dolmetsch instruments generally had a large rectangular windway, unlike the curved windways of all historical instruments, and played at modern pitch.

==== Repertoire ====
Nearly twice as many pieces have been written for the recorder since its modern revival as were written in all previous epochs. Many of these were composed by avant-garde composers of the latter half of the twentieth century who used the recorder for the variety of extended techniques which are possible using its open holes and its sensitivity to articulation.
Modern composers of great stature have written for the recorder, including Paul Hindemith, Luciano Berio, Jürg Baur, Markus Zahnhausen, Josef Tal, John Tavener, Michael Tippett, Benjamin Britten, Leonard Bernstein, Gordon Jacob, Malcolm Arnold, Steven Stucky, Sean Hickey, and Edmund Rubbra.

Owing to its ubiquity as a teaching instrument and the relative ease of sound production, the recorder has occasionally been used in popular music by groups such as The Beatles; the Rolling Stones (see, for example, &quot;Ruby Tuesday&quot;); Yes, for example, in the song &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen All Good People&quot;; Jefferson Airplane with Grace Slick on &quot;Surrealistic Pillow&quot;; Led Zeppelin (&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;); Jimi Hendrix; Siouxsie and the Banshees; Judy Dyble of Fairport Convention; Dido (e.g. &quot;Grafton Street&quot; on &quot;Safe Trip Home&quot;); and Mannheim Steamroller; Ian Anderson (Jethro Tull).
The Association featured a recorder in their 1967 hit &quot;Windy&quot;, as did the British band Vanity Fare in their 1970 hit &quot;Hitchin&#x27; a Ride&quot;.

==Manufacture==
The trade of recorder making was traditionally transmitted via apprenticeship. Notable historical makers include the Rafi, Schnitzer and Bassano families in the renaissance; Stanesby (Jr. and Sr.), J.C. and J. Denner, Hotteterre, Bressan, Haka, Heitz, Rippert, Rottenburgh, Steenbergen and Terton. Most of these makers also built other wind instruments such as oboes and transverse flutes. Notably, Jacob Denner is credited with the development of the clarinet from the chalumeau.

Recorder making declined with the instrument&#x27;s wane in the late eighteenth century, essentially severing the craft&#x27;s transmission to the modern age. With few exceptions, the duct flutes manufactured in the nineteenth and late eighteenth centuries were intended for amateur or educational use, and were not constructed to the high standard of earlier epochs.

Arnold Dolmetsch, the first to achieve commercial production in the twentieth century, began to build recorders in 1919. While these early recorders played at a low pitch like that of the available originals, he did not strive for exactitude in reproduction, and by the 1930s the Dolmetsch family firm, then under the direction of Arnold&#x27;s son Carl Dolmetsch, was mass-producing recorders at modern pitch with wide, straight windways, and began to produce bakelite recorders shortly after the Second World War. Nonetheless, the Dolmetsch models were innovative for their time and proved influential, particularly in standardising the English fingering system now standard for modern baroque-style instruments and doubled 6th and 7th holes, which are rare on antique instruments.

In Germany, Peter Harlan began to manufacture recorders in the 1920s, primarily for educational use in the youth movement. Following Harlan&#x27;s success, numerous makers such as Adler and Mollenhauer began commercial production of recorders, fuelling an explosion in the instrument&#x27;s popularity in Germany. These recorders shared little in common with antiques, with large straight windways, anachronistically pitched consorts, modified fingering systems and other innovations.

In the latter half of the twentieth century, historically informed performance practice was on the rise and recorder makers increasingly sought to imitate the sound and character of antiques. The German-American maker Friedrich von Huene was among the first to research recorders held in European collections and produce instruments intended to reproduce the qualities of the antiques. Von Huene and his Australian colleague Frederick Morgan sought to connect the tradition of the historical wind-makers to the modern day with the understanding that doing so creates the best instruments, and those most suited to ancient music.

Virtually all recorders manufactured today claim ascendancy to an antique model and most makers active today can trace their trade directly to one of these pioneering makers.

Today, makers maintaining individual workshops include Ammann, Blezinger, Bolton, Boudreau, Breukink, Brown, Coomber, Cranmore, de Paolis, Ehlert, Holmblat, Meyer, Musch, Netsch, Prescott, Rohmer, Takeyama, von Huene, and Wenner. French maker Philippe Bolton created an electroacoustic recorder and is among the last to offer mounted bell-keys and double bell-keys for both tenor and alto recorders. Those bell-keys extend easily the range of the instrument to more than three octaves. Invented by Carl Dolmetsch in 1957, he first used the bell-key system publicly in 1958.

==Use in schools==
In the twentieth century, Carl Orff used the recorder as part of his Orff-Schulwerk didactic approach. His five-volume &quot;Musik für Kinder&quot;, published between 1950 and 1954, contains pieces for recorders, often in combination with other instruments.

Manufacturers have made recorders out of bakelite and other more modern plastics; they are thus easy to produce, hence inexpensive. Because of this, recorders are popular in schools, as they are one of the cheapest instruments to buy in bulk. They are also relatively easy to play at a basic level because sound production needs only breath, and pitch is primarily determined by fingering (though excessive breath pressure will tend to drive the pitch sharp).

Most Japanese students are taught to play the recorder.

==Recorder ensembles==
The recorder is a very social instrument. Many recorder players participate in large groups or in one-to-a-part chamber groups, and there is a wide variety of music for such groupings including many modern works. Groups of different sized instruments help to compensate for the limited note range of the individual instruments. Four part arrangements with a soprano, alto, tenor and bass part played on the corresponding recorders are common, although more complex arrangements with multiple parts for each instrument and parts for lower and higher instruments may also be regularly encountered.

<doc id="26247" wikidata="Q7985" url="?curid=26247" title="Received Pronunciation">
<text>Received Pronunciation (RP) is the British English accent regarded as the standard one, carrying the highest social prestige, since as late as the very early 20th century. It is also commonly referred to as the Queen&#x27;s English or King&#x27;s English. The study of RP is concerned only with matters of pronunciation, while other features of standard British English, such as vocabulary, grammar, and style, are not considered.

Language scholars have long disagreed on RP&#x27;s exact definition, how geographically neutral it is, how many speakers there are, the nature and classification of its sub-varieties, how appropriate a choice it is as a standard, how the accent has changed over time, and even its name. The speakers who conventionally use RP have changed the accent to such a degree over the last century that many of its early 20th-century traditions of transcription and analysis have become outdated or are no longer considered evidence-based by linguists. Still, these traditions continue to be commonly taught and used, for instance in language education, and RP remains a popular umbrella term in ordinary British society and in linguistics. Standard Southern British English (SSBE) has been considered by some as an evolution of RP that is now commonplace (its name referring to Southern England), although SSBE has also been used by some linguists as a synonym for RP.

==History==
The tradition of &quot;Received Pronunciation&quot; is usually credited to the British phonetician Daniel Jones. In the first edition of the &quot;English Pronouncing Dictionary&quot; (1917), he named the accent &quot;Public School Pronunciation&quot;; for the second edition in 1926 he wrote: &quot;In what follows I call it Received Pronunciation, for want of a better term.&quot; However, the term had been used much earlier by P. S. Du Ponceau in 1818 and the Oxford English Dictionary cites quotations back to about 1710. A similar term, &quot;received standard,&quot; was coined by Henry C. K. Wyld in 1927. The early phonetician Alexander John Ellis used both terms interchangeably, but with a much broader definition than Jones&#x27;s, saying, &quot;There is no such thing as a uniform educated pron. of English, and rp. and rs. is a variable quantity differing from individual to individual, although all its varieties are &#x27;received&#x27;, understood and mainly unnoticed&quot;.

Although a form of Standard English had been established in the City of London by the end of the 15th century, it did not begin to resemble RP until the late 19th century. RP has most in common with the dialects of what has been termed the South East Midlands, in particular the Golden Triangle of universities, namely London, Oxford and Cambridge, and the public schools that fed them, such as Eton, Harrow and Rugby. In 1922, the BBC selected RP as its broadcasting standard, citing its being widely understood globally as a reason.

According to &quot;Fowler&#x27;s Modern English Usage&quot; (1965), &quot;the correct term is &#x27;the Received Pronunciation&#x27;. The word &#x27;received&#x27; conveys its original meaning of &#x27;accepted&#x27; or &#x27;approved&#x27;, as in &#x27; wisdom&#x27;.&quot;

===Alternative names===

Some linguists have used the term &quot;RP&quot; while expressing reservations about its suitability. The Cambridge-published &quot;English Pronouncing Dictionary&quot; (aimed at those learning English as a foreign language) uses the phrase &quot;BBC Pronunciation&quot;, on the basis that the name &quot;Received Pronunciation&quot; is &quot;archaic&quot; and that BBC News presenters no longer suggest high social class and privilege to their listeners. Other writers have also used the name &quot;BBC Pronunciation&quot;. The term &#x27;The Queen&#x27;s English&#x27; has also been used by some writers.

The phonetician Jack Windsor Lewis frequently criticised the name &quot;Received Pronunciation&quot; in his blog: he has called it &quot;invidious&quot;, a &quot;ridiculously archaic, parochial and question-begging term&quot; and noted that American scholars find the term &quot;quite curious&quot;. He used the term &quot;General British&quot; (to parallel &quot;General American&quot;) in his 1970s publication of &quot;A Concise Pronouncing Dictionary of American and British English&quot; and in subsequent publications. The name &quot;General British&quot; is adopted in the latest revision of Gimson&#x27;s &quot;Pronunciation of English&quot;. Beverley Collins and Inger Mees use the term &quot;Non-Regional Pronunciation&quot; for what is often otherwise called RP, and reserve the term &quot;Received Pronunciation&quot; for the &quot;upper-class speech of the twentieth century&quot;. Received Pronunciation has sometimes been called &quot;Oxford English&quot;, as it used to be the accent of most members of the University of Oxford. The &quot;Handbook of the International Phonetic Association&quot; uses the name &quot;Standard Southern British&quot;. Page 4 reads:

===Sub-varieties===
Faced with the difficulty of defining a single standard of RP, some researchers have tried to distinguish between sub-varieties:

* proposed Conservative, General, and Advanced; &quot;Conservative RP&quot; referred to a traditional accent associated with older speakers with certain social backgrounds; General RP was considered neutral regarding age, occupation or lifestyle of the speaker; and Advanced RP referred to speech of a younger generation of speakers. Later editions (e.g., Gimson 2008) use the terms General, Refined and Regional RP. In the latest revision of Gimson&#x27;s book, the terms preferred are General British (GB), Conspicuous GB and Regional GB.
* refers to &quot;mainstream RP&quot; and &quot;U-RP&quot;; he suggests that Gimson&#x27;s categories of Conservative and Advanced RP referred to the U-RP of the old and young respectively. However, Wells stated, &quot;It is difficult to separate stereotype from reality&quot; with U-RP. Writing on his blog in February 2013, Wells wrote, &quot;If only a very small percentage of English people speak RP, as Trudgill et al. claim, then the percentage speaking U-RP is vanishingly small&quot; and &quot;If I were redoing it today, I think I&#x27;d drop all mention of &#x27;U-RP&#x27;&quot;.
* Upton distinguishes between RP (which he equates with Wells&#x27;s &quot;mainstream RP&quot;), Traditional RP (after Ramsaran 1990), and an even older version which he identifies with Cruttenden&#x27;s &quot;Refined RP&quot;.
* An article on the website of the British Library refers to Conservative, Mainstream and Contemporary RP.

==Prevalence and perceptions==
Traditionally, Received Pronunciation has been associated with high social class. It was the &quot;everyday speech in the families of Southern English persons whose men-folk [had] been educated at the great public boarding-schools&quot; and which conveyed no information about that speaker&#x27;s region of origin before attending the school. An 1891 teacher&#x27;s handbook stated, &quot;It is the business of educated people to speak so that no-one may be able to tell in what county their childhood was passed&quot;. Nevertheless, in the 19th century some British prime ministers, such as William Ewart Gladstone, still spoke with some regional features.

Opinions differ over the proportion of Britons who speak RP. Trudgill estimated 3% in 1974, but that rough estimate has been questioned by J. Windsor Lewis. Upton notes higher estimates of 5% (Romaine, 2000) and 10% (Wells, 1982) but refers to these as &quot;guesstimates&quot; not based on robust research.

The claim that RP is non-regional is disputed, since it is most commonly found in London and the southeast of England. It is defined in the Concise Oxford English Dictionary as &quot;the standard accent of English as spoken in the South of England&quot;, and alternative names such as &quot;Standard Southern British&quot; have been used.
Despite RP&#x27;s historic high social prestige in Britain, being seen as the accent of those with power, money, and influence, it may be perceived negatively by some as being associated with undeserved, or accidental, privilege and as a symbol of the southeast&#x27;s political power in Britain. Based on a 1997 survey, Jane Stuart-Smith wrote, &quot;RP has little status in Glasgow, and is regarded with hostility in some quarters&quot;. A 2007 survey found that residents of Scotland and Northern Ireland tend to dislike RP. It is shunned by some with left-wing political views, who may be proud of having accents more typical of the working classes.

Since the Second World War, and increasingly since the 1960s, a wider acceptance of regional English varieties has taken hold in education and public life. Nonetheless, surveys from 1969 to 2022 consistently show that RP is perceived as the most prestigious accent of English in the United Kingdom. In 2022, 25% of British adults reported being mocked for their regional accent at work, and 46% in social situations.

==Use==
===Media===
In the early days of British broadcasting speakers of English origin almost universally used RP. The first director-general of the BBC, Lord Reith, encouraged the use of a &#x27;BBC accent&#x27; because it was a &quot;style or quality of English which would not be laughed at in any part of the country&quot;. He distinguished the BBC accent from the &#x27;Oxford accent&#x27;, to which he was &quot;vehemently opposed&quot;. In 1926 the BBC established an Advisory Committee on Spoken English with distinguished experts, including Daniel Jones, to advise on the correct pronunciation and other aspects of broadcast language. The Committee proved unsuccessful and was dissolved after the Second World War. 
While the BBC did advise its speakers on pronunciation, there was never a formalised official BBC pronunciation standard. A notable departure from the use of RP came with the Yorkshire-born newsreader Wilfred Pickles during the Second World War; his accent allowing listeners to more clearly distinguish BBC broadcasts from German propaganda, though Pickles had modified his accent to be closer to RP.
Since the Second World War RP has played a much smaller role in broadcast speech. RP remains the accent most often heard in the speech of announcers and newsreaders on BBC Radio 3 and Radio 4, and in some TV channels, but non-RP accents are now more widely encountered.

===Dictionaries===

Most English dictionaries published in Britain (including the Oxford English Dictionary) now give phonetically transcribed RP pronunciations for all words. Pronunciation dictionaries represent a special class of dictionary giving a wide range of possible pronunciations: British pronunciation dictionaries are all based on RP, though not necessarily using that name. Daniel Jones transcribed RP pronunciations of words and names in the English Pronouncing Dictionary. Cambridge University Press continues to publish this title, as of 1997 edited by Peter Roach. Two other pronunciation dictionaries are in common use: the &quot;Longman Pronunciation Dictionary&quot;, compiled by John C. Wells (using the name &quot;Received Pronunciation&quot;), and Clive Upton&#x27;s &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English&quot;, (now republished as &quot;The Routledge Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English&quot;).

===Language teaching===
Pronunciation forms an essential component of language learning and teaching; a &quot;model accent&quot; is necessary for learners to aim at, and to act as a basis for description in textbooks and classroom materials. RP has been the traditional choice for teachers and learners of British English. However, the choice of pronunciation model is difficult, and the adoption of RP is in many ways problematic.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
Nasals and liquids (, , , , ) may be syllabic in unstressed syllables. The consonant in RP is generally a postalveolar approximant, which would normally be expressed with the sign in the International Phonetic Alphabet, but the sign is nonetheless traditionally used for RP in most of the literature on the topic.

Voiceless plosives (, , , ) are aspirated at the beginning of a syllable, unless a completely unstressed vowel follows. (For example, the is aspirated in &quot;impasse&quot;, with primary stress on &quot;-passe&quot;, but not &quot;compass&quot;, where &quot;-pass&quot; has no stress.) Aspiration does not occur when precedes in the same syllable, as in &quot;spot&quot; or &quot;stop&quot;. When a sonorant , , , or follows, this aspiration is indicated by partial devoicing of the sonorant. is a fricative when devoiced.

Syllable final , , , and may be either preceded by a glottal stop (glottal reinforcement) or, in the case of , fully replaced by a glottal stop, especially before a syllabic nasal (&quot;bitten&quot; ). The glottal stop may be realised as creaky voice; thus, an alternative phonetic transcription of &quot;attempt&quot; could be .

As in other varieties of English, voiced plosives (, , , ) are partly or even fully devoiced at utterance boundaries or adjacent to voiceless consonants. The voicing distinction between voiced and voiceless sounds is reinforced by a number of other differences, with the result that the two of consonants can clearly be distinguished even in the presence of devoicing of voiced sounds:

*Aspiration of voiceless consonants syllable-initially
*Glottal reinforcement of /p, t, k, tʃ/ syllable-finally
*Shortening of vowels before voiceless consonants

As a result, some authors prefer to use the terms &quot;fortis&quot; and &quot;lenis&quot; in place of &quot;voiceless&quot; and &quot;voiced&quot;. However, the latter are traditional and in more frequent usage.

The voiced dental fricative () is more often a weak dental plosive; the sequence is often realised as (a long dental nasal). has velarised allophone () in the syllable rhyme. becomes voiced () between voiced sounds.

===Vowels===



Examples of short vowels: in &quot;kit&quot;, &quot;mirror&quot; and &quot;rabbit&quot;, in &quot;foot&quot; and &quot;cook&quot;, in &quot;dress&quot; and &quot;merry&quot;, in &quot;strut&quot; and &quot;curry&quot;, in &quot;trap&quot; and &quot;marry&quot;, in &quot;lot&quot; and orange&quot;, in ago&quot; and &quot;sofa&quot;.

Examples of long vowels: in &quot;fleece&quot;, in &quot;goose&quot;, in &quot;bear&quot;, in &quot;nurse&quot; and &quot;furry&quot;, in &quot;north&quot;, &quot;force&quot; and &quot;thought&quot;, in &quot;father&quot; and &quot;start&quot;.

The long mid front vowel is elsewhere transcribed with the traditional symbols . The predominant realisation in contemporary RP is monophthongal.

====&quot;Long&quot; and &quot;short&quot; vowels====
Many conventional descriptions of the RP vowel system group the non-diphthongal vowels into the categories &quot;long&quot; and &quot;short&quot;. This should not be taken to mean that RP has minimal pairs in which the only difference is vowel length. &quot;Long&quot; and &quot;short&quot; are convenient cover terms for a number of phonetic features. The long-short pairings shown above include also differences in vowel quality.

The vowels called &quot;long&quot; high vowels in RP and are slightly diphthongized, and are often narrowly transcribed in phonetic literature as diphthongs and . The starting point of the diphthongal can be either close to or a more centralized and even unrounded , and its narrow transcriptions could be either or .

Vowels may be phonologically long or short (i.e. belong to the long or the short group of vowel phonemes) but their length is influenced by their context: in particular, they are shortened if a voiceless (fortis) consonant follows in the syllable, so that, for example, the vowel in &#x27;bat&#x27; is shorter than the vowel in &#x27;bad&#x27; . The process is known as &quot;pre-fortis clipping&quot;. Thus phonologically short vowels in one context can be phonetically &quot;longer&quot; than phonologically long vowels in another context. For example, the vowel called &quot;long&quot; in &#x27;reach&#x27; (which ends with a voiceless consonant) may be &quot;shorter&quot; than the vowel called &quot;short&quot; in the word &#x27;ridge&#x27; (which ends with a voiced consonant). Wiik, cited in , published durations of English vowels with a mean value of 172 ms for short vowels before voiced consonants but a mean value of 165 ms for long vowels preceding voiceless consonants.

In natural speech, the plosives and often have no audible release utterance-finally, and voiced consonants are partly or completely devoiced (as in ); thus the perceptual distinction between pairs of words such as &#x27;bad&#x27; and &#x27;bat&#x27;, or &#x27;seed&#x27; and &#x27;seat&#x27; rests mostly on vowel length (though the presence or absence of glottal reinforcement provides an additional cue).

Unstressed vowels are both shorter and more centralised than stressed ones. In unstressed syllables occurring before vowels and in final position, contrasts between long and short high vowels are neutralised and short and occur (e.g. &quot;happy&quot; , &quot;throughout&quot; ). The neutralisation is common throughout many English dialects, though the phonetic realisation of e.g. rather than (a phenomenon called &quot;happy&quot;-tensing) is not as universal.

According to Jane Setter, the typical pronunciation of the short is a weakly rounded near-close near-back rounded vowel .

====Diphthongs and triphthongs====

The centring diphthongs are gradually being eliminated in RP. The vowel (as in &quot;door&quot;, &quot;boar&quot;) had largely merged with by the Second World War, and the vowel (as in &quot;poor&quot;, &quot;tour&quot;) has more recently merged with as well among most speakers, although the sound is still found in conservative speakers, and in less common words such as &quot;boor&quot;. See – merger. More recently has become a pure long vowel , as explained above. is increasingly pronounced as a monophthong , although without merging with any existing vowels.

The diphthong is pronounced by some RP speakers in a noticeably different way when it occurs before , if that consonant is syllable-final and not followed by a vowel (the context in which is pronounced as a &quot;dark l&quot;). The realization of in this case begins with a more back, rounded and sometimes more open vowel quality; it may be transcribed as or . It is likely that the backness of the diphthong onset is the result of allophonic variation caused by the raising of the back of the tongue for the . If the speaker has &quot;l-vocalization&quot; the is realized as a back rounded vowel, which again is likely to cause backing and rounding in a preceding vowel as coarticulation effects. This phenomenon has been discussed in several blogs by John C. Wells. In the recording included in this article the phrase &quot;fold his cloak&quot; contains examples of the diphthong in the two different contexts. The onset of the pre- diphthong in &quot;fold&quot; is slightly more back and rounded than that in &quot;cloak&quot;.

RP also possesses the triphthongs as in &quot;tire&quot;, as in &quot;tower&quot;, as in &quot;lower&quot;, as in &quot;layer&quot; and as in &quot;loyal&quot;. There are different possible realisations of these items: in slow, careful speech they may be pronounced as two syllables with three distinct vowel qualities in succession, or as a monosyllabic triphthong. In more casual speech the middle vowel may be considerably reduced, by a process known as smoothing, and in an extreme form of this process the triphthong may even be reduced to a single long vowel. In such a case the difference between , , and in &quot;tower&quot;, &quot;tire&quot;, and &quot;tar&quot; may be neutralised with all three units realised as or . This type of smoothing is known as the &quot;tower&quot;–&quot;tire&quot;, &quot;tower&quot;–&quot;tar&quot; and &quot;tire&quot;–&quot;tar&quot; mergers.

====BATH vowel====

There are differing opinions as to whether in the lexical set can be considered RP. The pronunciations with are invariably accepted as RP. The &quot;English Pronouncing Dictionary&quot; does not admit in words and the &quot;Longman Pronunciation Dictionary&quot; lists them with a § marker of non-RP status. John Wells wrote in a blog entry on 16 March 2012 that when growing up in the north of England he used in &quot;bath&quot; and &quot;glass&quot;, and considers this the only acceptable phoneme in RP. Others have argued that is too categorical in the north of England to be excluded. Clive Upton believes that in these words must be considered within RP and has called the opposing view &quot;south-centric&quot;. Upton&#x27;s &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Pronunciation for Current English&quot; gives both variants for words. A. F. Gupta&#x27;s survey of mostly middle-class students found that was used by almost everyone who was from clearly north of the isogloss for words. She wrote, &quot;There is no justification for the claims by Wells and Mugglestone that this is a sociolinguistic variable in the north, though it is a sociolinguistic variable on the areas on the border [the isogloss between north and south]&quot;. In a study of speech in West Yorkshire, K. M. Petyt wrote that &quot;the amount of usage is too low to correlate meaningfully with the usual factors&quot;, having found only two speakers (both having attended boarding schools in the south) who consistently used .

Jack Windsor Lewis has noted that the Oxford Dictionary&#x27;s position has changed several times on whether to include short within its prescribed pronunciation. The &quot;BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names&quot; uses only , but its author, Graham Pointon, has stated on his blog that he finds both variants to be acceptable in place names.

Some research has concluded that many people in the North of England have a dislike of the vowel in words. A. F. Gupta wrote, &quot;Many of the northerners were noticeably hostile to , describing it as &#x27;comical&#x27;, &#x27;snobbish&#x27;, &#x27;pompous&#x27; or even &#x27;for morons&#x27;.&quot; On the subject, K. M. Petyt wrote that several respondents &quot;positively said that they did not prefer the long-vowel form or that they really detested it or even that it was incorrect&quot;. Mark Newbrook has assigned this phenomenon the name &quot;conscious rejection&quot;, and has cited the vowel as &quot;the main instance of conscious rejection of RP&quot; in his research in West Wirral.

====French words====
John Wells has argued that, as educated British speakers often attempt to pronounce French names in a French way, there is a case for including (as in ), and and (as in ), as marginal members of the RP vowel system. He also argues against including other French vowels on the grounds that not many British speakers succeed in distinguishing the vowels in and , or in and . However, the &quot;Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary&quot; draws a distinction between (there rendered as ) and the unrounded of for a total of four nasal vowels.

====Alternative notations====
Not all reference sources use the same system of transcription. Clive Upton devised a modified system for the &quot;Shorter Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (1993), changing five symbols from the traditional Gimson system, and this is now used in many other Oxford University Press dictionaries; the differences are shown in the table below.

Linguist Geoff Lindsey has argued that the system of transcription for RP has become outdated and has proposed a new system (which he calls Standard Southern British, or SSB) as a replacement.

Lindsey&#x27;s system is as follows—differences between it and standard transcription are depicted with the traditional transcription in parentheses.
==Historical variation==

Like all accents, RP has changed with time. For example, sound recordings and films from the first half of the 20th century demonstrate that it was usual for speakers of RP to pronounce the sound, as in &quot;land&quot;, with a vowel close to , so that &quot;land&quot; would sound similar to a present-day pronunciation of &quot;lend&quot;. RP is sometimes known as &quot;the Queen&#x27;s English&quot;, but recordings show that even Queen Elizabeth II shifted her pronunciation over the course of her reign, ceasing to use an -like vowel in words like &quot;land&quot;. The change in RP may be observed in the home of &quot;BBC English&quot;. The BBC accent of the 1950s is distinctly different from today&#x27;s: a news report from the 1950s is recognisable as such, and a mock-1950s BBC voice is used for comic effect in programmes wishing to satirise 1950s social attitudes such as the Harry Enfield Show and its &quot;Mr. Cholmondley-Warner&quot; sketches.
A few illustrative examples of changes in RP during the 20th century and early 21st are given below. A more comprehensive list (using the name &quot;General British&quot; in place of &quot;RP&quot;) is given in &quot;Gimson&#x27;s Pronunciation of English&quot;.

===Vowels and diphthongs===

* Words such as , &quot;gone&quot;, &quot;off&quot;, &quot;often&quot;, &quot;cross&quot; were formerly pronounced with instead of , so that &quot;often&quot; and &quot;orphan&quot; were homophones (see &quot;lot&quot;–&quot;cloth&quot; split). The Queen continued to use the older pronunciations, but it is now rare to hear this on the BBC.
* There used to be a distinction between &quot;horse&quot; and &quot;hoarse&quot; with an extra diphthong appearing in words like &quot;hoarse&quot;, , and &quot;pour&quot;. The symbols used by Wright are slightly different: the sound in &quot;fall, law, saw&quot; is transcribed as and that in &quot;more, soar,&quot; etc. as . Daniel Jones gives an account of the /ɔə/ diphthong, but notes &quot;many speakers of Received English (&quot;sic&quot;), myself among them, do not use the diphthong at all, but replace it always by /ɔː/&quot;. This distinction had become obsolete in RP by the late 20th century.
* The vowel in words such as &quot;tour&quot;, &quot;moor&quot;, &quot;sure&quot; used to be , but this has merged with for many contemporary speakers. The effect of these two mergers (horse-hoarse and moor-more) is to bring about a number of three-way mergers of items which were hitherto distinct, such as &quot;poor&quot;, &quot;paw&quot; and &quot;pore&quot; (, , ) all becoming .
* The vowel and the starting point of the diphthong has become lowered from mid to open-mid .
* The starting point of the diphthong has raised from to .
* Before the Second World War, the vowel of &quot;cup&quot; was a back vowel close to cardinal . It then shifted forward to , but is increasingly used in modern RP to avoid the clash with the lowered variety of in the region (the trap-strut merger).
* There has been a change in the pronunciation of the unstressed final vowel of &quot;happy&quot; as a result of a process known as happY-tensing: an older pronunciation of &quot;happy&quot; would have had the vowel /ɪ/ whereas a more modern pronunciation has a vowel nearer to /iː/. In pronunciation handbooks and dictionaries it is now common to use the symbol /i/ to cover both possibilities. 
* In a number of words where contemporary RP has an unstressed syllable with schwa , older pronunciations had , for instance, the final vowel in the following: &quot;kindness&quot;, &quot;doubtless&quot;, &quot;witness&quot;, &quot;witless&quot;, &quot;toilet&quot;, &quot;fortunate&quot;.
* The phoneme (as in &quot;fair&quot;, &quot;care&quot;, &quot;there&quot;) was realized as a centring diphthong in the past, whereas most present-day speakers of RP pronounce it as a long monophthong .
* The (as in &quot;near&quot;, &quot;serious&quot;) and (as in &quot;cure&quot;, &quot;rural&quot;; when not merged with ) phonemes are also becoming monophthongised to and , though this is not yet as widespread as for .
* A change in the symbolisation of the GOAT diphthong reflects a change in the pronunciation of the starting point: older accounts of this diphthong describe it as starting with [ö̞], moving towards [u]. This was often symbolized as /ou/ or /oʊ/. In modern RP the starting point is unrounded and central, and is symbolized /əʊ/.
* The vowels in and , traditionally transcribed as and , have shifted upwards, and are now close to and , respectively, in quality.
* The vowels in and , traditionally transcribed as and , have undergone fronting and reduction in the amount of lip-rounding (phonetically, these can be transcribed and , respectively). 
* As noted above, the vowel has become more open, near to cardinal .

===Consonants===

* For speakers of Received Pronunciation in the late 19th century, it was common for the consonant combination (as in &quot;which&quot;, &quot;whistle&quot;, &quot;whether&quot;) to be realised as a voiceless labio-velar fricative (also transcribed ), as can still be heard in the 21st century in the speech of many speakers in Ireland, Scotland and parts of the US. Since the beginning of the 20th century, however, the phoneme has ceased to be a feature of RP, except in an exaggeratedly precise style of speaking (the wine-whine merger).
* There has been considerable growth in glottalization in RP, most commonly in the form of glottal reinforcement. This has been noted by writers on RP since quite early in the 20th century. Ward notes pronunciations such as [njuːʔtrəl] for &quot;neutral&quot; and [reʔkləs] for &quot;reckless&quot;. Glottalization of /tʃ/ is widespread in present-day RP when at the end of a stressed syllable, as in &quot;butcher&quot; [bʊʔtʃə].
* The realization of /r/ as a tap or flap [ɾ] has largely disappeared from RP, though it can be heard in films and broadcasts from the first half of the 20th century. The word &quot;very&quot; was frequently pronounced [veɾɪ]. The same sound, however, is sometimes pronounced as an allophone of /t/ when it occurs intervocalically after a stressed syllable – the &quot;flapped /t/&quot; that is familiar in American English. Phonetically, this sounds more like /d/, and this pronunciation is sometimes known as /t/-voicing.

===Word-specific changes===

A number of cases can be identified where changes in the pronunciation of individual words, or small groups of words, have taken place.

* The word &quot;Mass&quot; (referring to the religious ritual) was often pronounced /mɑːs/ in older versions of RP, but the word is now almost always /mæs/.
* The indefinite article &quot;an&quot; was traditionally used before a sounded /h/ if immediately followed by an unstressed vowel, as in &#x27;an hyaena.&#x27; This is now uncommon, especially in speech, and may be confined only to some of the more frequently used words, such as &#x27;horrific&#x27; and &#x27;historical.&#x27;

==Comparison with other varieties of English==
* Like most other varieties of English outside Northern England, RP has undergone the &quot;foot&quot;–&quot;strut&quot; split: pairs like &quot;put&quot;/&quot;putt&quot; are pronounced differently.
* RP is a non-rhotic accent, so does not occur unless followed immediately by a vowel. Pairs such as &quot;father&quot;/&quot;farther&quot;, &quot;caught&quot;/&quot;court&quot; and &quot;formally&quot;/&quot;formerly&quot; are homophones.
* Unlike a number of North American accents of English, RP has not undergone the &quot;Mary&quot;–&quot;marry&quot;–&quot;merry&quot;, &quot;nearer&quot;–&quot;mirror&quot;, or &quot;hurry&quot;–&quot;furry&quot; mergers: all these words are distinct from each other.
* Unlike many North American accents, RP has not undergone the &quot;father&quot;–&quot;bother&quot; or &quot;cot&quot;–&quot;caught&quot; mergers.
* RP does not have yod-dropping after , , , and , but most speakers of RP have &quot;yod&quot;-dropping after and . Hence, for example, &quot;new&quot;, &quot;tune&quot;, &quot;dune&quot;, &quot;resume&quot; and &quot;enthusiasm&quot; are pronounced , , , and rather than , , , and . This contrasts with many East Anglian and East Midland varieties of English language in England and with many forms of American English, including General American. In words such as &quot;pursuit&quot; and &quot;allure&quot;, both pronunciations (with and without ) are heard in RP. There are, however, several words where a yod has been lost with the passage of time: for example, the word &quot;suit&quot; originally had a yod in RP but this is now extremely rare.
* The flapped variant of and (as in much of the West Country, Ulster, most North American varieties including General American, Australian English, and the Cape Coloured dialect of South Africa) is not used very often. 
* RP has undergone the &quot;wine&quot;–&quot;whine&quot; merger (so the sequence is not present except among those who have acquired this distinction as the result of speech training). The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, based in London, still teaches these two sounds for international breadth as distinct phonemes. They are also distinct from one another in most of Scotland and Ireland, in the northeast of England, and in the southeastern United States.
* Unlike some other varieties of English language in England, there is no &quot;h&quot;-dropping in words like &quot;head&quot; or &quot;horse&quot;. In hurried phrases such as &quot;as hard as he could&quot; h-dropping commonly applies to the word &quot;he&quot;.
* Unlike most Southern Hemisphere English and North American English accents, RP has not undergone the weak vowel merger, meaning that pairs such as &quot;Lenin&quot;/&quot;Lennon&quot; are distinct.
*In traditional RP is an allophone of (it is used intervocalically after a stressed syllable, after , and sometimes even after , ).

==Spoken specimen==
The &quot;Journal of the International Phonetic Association&quot; regularly publishes &quot;Illustrations of the IPA&quot; which present an outline of the phonetics of a particular language or accent. It is usual to base the description on a recording of the traditional story of the North Wind and the Sun. There is an IPA illustration of British English (Received Pronunciation).

The female speaker is described as having been born in 1953 and educated at Oxford University. To accompany the recording there are three transcriptions: orthographic, phonemic and allophonic.
Phonemic

Allophonic

Orthographic

The North Wind and the Sun were disputing which was the stronger, when a traveller came along wrapped in a warm cloak. They agreed that the one who first succeeded in making the traveller take his cloak off should be considered stronger than the other. Then the North Wind blew as hard as he could, but the more he blew the more closely did the traveller fold his cloak around him, and at last the North Wind gave up the attempt. Then the Sun shone out warmly, and immediately the traveller took off his cloak. And so the North Wind was obliged to confess that the Sun was the stronger of the two.

<text>Ryan Donald Lackey (born March 17, 1979) is an entrepreneur and computer security professional. He was a co-founder of HavenCo, the world&#x27;s first data haven, and operated BlueIraq, a communications company. He speaks at numerous conferences and trade shows, including DEF CON and the RSA Data Security Conference, on various topics in the computer security field, and has appeared in a &quot;Wired&quot; magazine cover story and in numerous television, radio, and print articles, concerning HavenCo and Sealand.

== Early life ==
Lackey was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania and has lived throughout the US and Europe, and in Anguilla, Sealand, Dubai, and Iraq. As a teenager, he was briefly involved with the Globewide Network Academy. Lackey attended MIT and majored in Course 18 (mathematics), eventually dropping out due to financial constraints. While there, Lackey became interested in electronic cash and distributed systems, originally for massively multiplayer online gaming. This interest led to attending several conferences (Financial Cryptography 98, various MIT presentations), participating on mailing lists such as &quot;cypherpunks&quot; and &quot;dbs&quot;, and, with Ian Goldberg, eventually implementing patented Chaumian digital cash in an underground library, HINDE, which was named after Hinde ten Berge, a Dutch cypherpunk also present at FC98. He contributed to the cypherpunks movement as one of the longest anonymous remailer operators.

== Career ==
In 1999 Lackey lived in the San Francisco Bay Area before moving to the self-proclaimed state of Sealand and establishing HavenCo. In December 2002, he left HavenCo, following a dispute with other company directors and the Sealand &quot;Royal Family&quot;.

During the US conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, Lackey operated BlueIraq, a VSAT communications and IT company serving the DoD and domestic markets in those countries. BlueIraq&#x27;s business model eventually became economically unfeasible due to an escalation in anti-Western violence (primarily in the form of improvised explosive devices) and troop drawdowns. BlueIraq sought venture capital to transform itself into a large general consumer cellular telephone company, but the 2008 financial crisis and the instability of Iraq and Afghanistan made fundraising impossible.

Lackey returned to the US and located in San Francisco, where he worked for a number of start-up companies before applying to Y Combinator. He was accepted into Y Combinator&#x27;s Summer 2011 round. Lackey founded CryptoSeal, a VPN as a service start-up with a small group of people well known in the computer security community, and secured funding from Ron Conway and a well known venture capital fund. In June 2014, CryptoSeal was acquired by Cloudflare.

In 2017, he began working as Chief Security Officer for the Tezos Foundation in support of the Tezos blockchain. According to his LinkedIn profile, Lackey left that position in November of 2020, and as of 2021 is employed at a crypto-related insurance company in Puerto Rico.

<doc id="26253" wikidata="Q1930146" url="?curid=26253" title="Revised Julian calendar">
<text>The Revised Julian calendar, or less formally the new calendar and also known as the Milanković calendar, is a calendar proposed in 1923 by the Serbian scientist Milutin Milanković as a more accurate alternative to both Julian and Gregorian calendars. At the time, the Julian calendar was still in use by all of the Eastern Orthodox Church and affiliated nations, while the Catholic and Protestant nations were using the Gregorian calendar. Thus, Milanković&#x27;s aim was to discontinue the divergence between the naming of dates in Eastern and Western churches and nations. It was intended to replace the Julian calendar in Eastern Orthodox Churches and nations. From 1 March 1600 through 28 February 2800, the Revised Julian calendar aligns its dates with the Gregorian calendar, which had been proclaimed in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII.

The Revised Julian calendar has been adopted for ecclesiastical use by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, the Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania, the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria, the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch, the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, the Romanian Orthodox Church, the Cypriot Orthodox Church, the Church of Greece, the Orthodox Church of the Czech Lands and Slovakia, the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, the Orthodox Church in America. It has not been adopted by the Russian Orthodox Church, the Serbian Orthodox Church, the Macedonian Orthodox Church, the Georgian Orthodox Church, the Polish Orthodox Church and the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem. It has not been adopted by any nation as an official calendar. Instead, all of the Eastern Orthodox nations have adopted the Gregorian calendar as the official state calendar.

The Revised Julian calendar has the same months and month lengths as the Julian and Gregorian calendar, but, in the Revised Julian version, years evenly divisible by 100 are not leap years, except that years with remainders of 200 or 600 when divided by 900 remain leap years, e.g. 2000 and 2400 as in the Gregorian calendar.

==Implementation==
Comparison of Revised Julian and Gregoriancalendar century years. (In the original Juliancalendar, every century year is a leap year.)

A committee composed of members of the Greek government and Greek Orthodox Church was set up to look into the question of calendar reform. It reported in January 1923. In the end, for civil purposes, the Gregorian calendar was adopted; the changeover went into effect on 16 February 1923/1 March 1923.

After the promulgation of the royal decree, the Ecumenical Patriarch, Patriarch Meletius IV of Constantinople, issued an encyclical on 3 February recommending the calendar&#x27;s adoption by Orthodox churches, which is why it is sometimes also known as the Meletian Calendar. The matter came up for discussion at the Council of Constantinople (1923), which deliberated in May and June. Subsequently, it was adopted by several of the autocephalous Orthodox churches. The synod was chaired by Meletius IV and representatives were present from the churches of Cyprus, Greece, Romania and Serbia. There were no representatives of the other members of the original Orthodox Pentarchy (the Patriarchates of Jerusalem, Antioch, and Alexandria) or from the largest Orthodox church, the Russian Orthodox Church.

The Serbian delegation presented a proposal by Maksim Trpković, which had a leap year rule in which century years would become common years, except those with remainders of 0 or 400 when divided by 900, which would remain leap years. However, it was rejected because the proposal would omit a leap year in 2000, which would cause it to differ from the Gregorian after only 77 years. Milanković proposed a small modification of Trpkovic&#x27;s proposal, changing the timing of the century leap years to those with remainder 200 or 600 when divided by 900 in order to maximise the amount of time before it would differ from the Gregorian.

Milanković&#x27;s arguments won the day. In its decision the conference noted that &quot;the difference between the length of the political year of the new calendar and the Gregorian is so small that only after 877 years it is observed difference of dates.&quot; The same decision provided that the coming should be called , thus dropping thirteen days. It then adopted the leap year rule of Milanković. The proposed calendar was preferred over the Gregorian because its mean year was within two seconds of the then current length of the &quot;mean&quot; tropical year. The present &quot;vernal equinox&quot; year, however, is about 12 seconds longer, in terms of mean solar days.

The synod also proposed the adoption of an astronomical rule for Easter: Easter was to be the Sunday after the midnight-to-midnight day at the meridian of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem (35°13′47.2″ E or UT+22055 for the small dome) during which the first full moon after the vernal equinox occurs. Although the instant of the full moon must occur after the instant of the vernal equinox, it may occur on the same day. If the full moon occurs on a Sunday, Easter is the following Sunday. Churches that adopted this calendar did so on varying dates. However, all Eastern Orthodox churches continue to use the Julian calendar to determine the date of Easter (except for the Finnish Orthodox Church, which now uses the Gregorian Easter; the Estonian Orthodox Church used the Gregorian Easter from 1923 to 1945).

There were attempts to introduce Revised Julian as a religious calendar in the Soviet Union. On 12 June 1923, it was accepted by the short-lived schismatic Renovationist Church, which had seized church buildings with the support of the Soviet government while Patriarch Tikhon was under house arrest. After his release, on , he declared that all Renovationist decrees were without grace. On 15 October 1923, Patriarch Tikhon accepted the new calendar, but it caused disagreement among clergy, and 24 days later he reverted the decision. The present Russian Orthodox Church continues to use the Julian calendar for both its fixed festivals and for Easter.

==Arithmetic==

The following are Gregorian minus Revised Julian date differences, calculated for the beginning of January and March in each century year, which is where differences arise or disappear, until AD 10000. These are exact arithmetic calculations, not depending on any astronomy. A negative difference means that the proleptic Revised Julian calendar was behind the proleptic Gregorian calendar. The Revised Julian calendar is the same as the Gregorian calendar from 1 March 1600 to 28 February 2800, but the following day would be 1 March 2800 (RJ) or 29 February 2800 (G); this difference is denoted as &#x27;+1&#x27; in the table. 2900 is a leap year in Revised Julian, but not Gregorian: 29 February 2900 (RJ) is the same as 28 February 2900 (G) and the next day will be 1 March 2900 in both calendars - hence the &#x27;0&#x27; notation.

In 900 Julian years there are = 225 leap days. The Revised Julian leap rule omits seven of nine century leap years, leaving leap days per 900-year cycle. Thus the calendar mean year is 365 +  days, but this is actually a double-cycle that reduces to 365 +  = 365.24 days, or exactly 365 days 5 hours 48 minutes 48 seconds, which is exactly 24 seconds shorter than the Gregorian mean year of 365.2425 days, so in the long term on &quot;average&quot; the Revised Julian calendar pulls ahead of the Gregorian calendar by one day in 3600 years.

The number of days per Revised Julian cycle = 900 × 365 + 218 = 328,718 days. Taking mod 7 leaves a remainder of 5, so like the Julian calendar, but unlike the Gregorian calendar, the Revised Julian calendar cycle does not contain a whole number of weeks. Therefore, a full repetition of the Revised Julian leap cycle with respect to the seven-day weekly cycle is seven times the cycle length = 7 × 900 = 6300 years.

==March equinox==
The following is a scatter plot of actual astronomical northward equinox moments as numerically integrated by SOLEX 11 using DE421 mode with extended (80-bit) floating point precision, high integration order (18th order), and forced solar mass loss (&quot;forced&quot; means taken into account at all times). SOLEX can automatically search for northern hemisphere spring equinox moments by finding when the solar declination crosses the celestial equator northward, and then it outputs that data as the Terrestrial Time day and fraction of day relative to at noon (J2000.0 epoch). The progressive tidal slowing of the Earth rotation rate was accounted for by subtracting Δ&quot;T&quot; as calculated by the Espenak-Meeus polynomial set recommended at the NASA Eclipses web site to obtain the J2000.0-relative Universal Time moments, which were then properly converted to Revised Julian dates and Jerusalem local apparent time, taking local apparent midnight as the beginning of each calendar day. The year range of the chart was limited to dates before the year AD 4400: by then Δ&quot;T&quot; is expected to accumulate to about six hours, with an uncertainty of less than hours.

The chart shows that the long-term equinox drift of the Revised Julian calendar is quite satisfactory, at least until AD 4400. The medium-term wobble spans about two days because, like the Gregorian calendar, the leap years of the Revised Julian calendar are not smoothly spread: they occur mostly at intervals of four years but there are occasional eight-year gaps (at 7 out of 9 century years). Evidently each of the authorities responsible for the Gregorian and Revised Julian calendars, respectively, accepted a modest amount of medium-term equinox wobble for the sake of traditionally perceived leap rule mental arithmetic simplicity. Therefore, the wobble is essentially a curiosity that is of no practical or ritual concern.

==Adoption==
The new calendar has been adopted by Orthodox churches as follows:

* 1920: In Finland Orthodox faithful began attending Lutheran churches on holy days
* October 1921 Finland officially switched to the Gregorian calendar, including the Gregorian Paschalion
* 1923: Estonia (accepted the Gregorian calendar, including the Gregorian Paschalion, but in 1945 joined the Moscow Patriarchate and reverted to Julian; after re-establishing in 1996, the Estonian Apostolic Orthodox Church adopted the Revised Julian calendar in 2012)
*10/23 March 1924: Constantinople, Cyprus and Greece
*1/14 October 1924: Poland (Very few parishes changed - on 15 June 2014 the Church switched back, but individual parishes may use the Revised Julian calendar if they wish)

==Defense==

The basic justification for the new calendar is the known errors of the Julian calendar, which will in the course of time lead to a situation in which those following the Julian calendar (in the Northern Hemisphere) will be reckoning the month of December (and the feast of Christ&#x27;s Nativity) during the heat of summer, August and its feasts during the deep cold of winter, Easter during the autumn season, and the November feasts in the springtime. This would conflict with the Church&#x27;s historic practice of celebrating Christ&#x27;s birth on , a date chosen for a number of reasons. One of the reasons mentioned by Bennet is the time of the winter solstice, when the days begin to lengthen again as the physical sun makes its reappearance, along with the fact that Christ has traditionally been recognized by Christians as the metaphorical and spiritual sun who fulfills Malachi&#x27;s prophetic words: &quot;the sun of righteousness will shine with healing in its wings&quot; (Malachi 4:2). The identification, based on this prophecy, of Jesus Christ as the &quot;sun of righteousness&quot; is found many times in writings of the early Church fathers and follows from many New Testament references linking Jesus with imagery of sun and light.

==Criticism==

Critics see the change in calendar as an unwarranted innovation, influenced by Western society. They say that no sound theological reason has been given for changing the calendar, that the only reasons advanced are social. The proposal for change was introduced by Meletios Metaxakis, Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, a patriarch whose canonical status has been disputed.

The argument is also made that since the use of the Julian calendar was implicit in the decision of the First Ecumenical Council at Nicaea (325), which standardized the calculation of the date of Easter, no authority less than an Ecumenical Council may change it. It is further argued that the adoption of the new calendar in some countries and not in others has broken the liturgical unity of the Eastern Orthodox churches, undoing the decision made by the council of bishops at Nicaea to decree that all local churches celebrate Easter on the same day. The emperor Constantine, writing to the bishops absent from the council to notify them of the decision, argued, &quot;Think, then, how unseemly it is, that on the same day some should be fasting whilst others are seated at a banquet&quot;.

Liturgical objections to the new calendar stem from the fact that it adjusts only those liturgical celebrations that occur on fixed calendar dates, leaving all of the commemorations on the moveable cycle on the original Julian calendar. This upsets the harmony and balance of the liturgical year. (This would not have been a problem if the recommendations of the 1923 synod to use an astronomical rule to reckon the date of Easter, as outlined above, had not been rejected.) This disruption is most noticeable during Great Lent. Certain feast days are designed to fall during Lent, such as the feast of the Forty Martyrs of Sebaste. The Feast of the Annunciation is also intended to fall either before Easter or during Bright Week. Sometimes, Annunciation will fall on the day of Easter itself, a very special concurrence known as &quot;Kyrio-Pascha&quot;, with special liturgical practices appointed for such an occurrence. However, under the new calendar, &quot;Kyrio-Pascha&quot; becomes an impossibility. The Apostles&#x27; Fast displays the most difficult aspect of the new calendar. The fast begins on the moveable cycle and ends on the fixed date of 29 June; since the new calendar is 13 days ahead of the traditional Julian calendar, the Apostles&#x27; Fast is 13 days shorter for those who follow the new calendar, and some years it is completely abrogated. Furthermore, critics of the new calendar point out the advantage to celebrating Nativity separately from the secular observances of Christmas and New Year, which are associated with partying and alcohol consumption.

Critics also point out that proponents of the new calendar tend to use worldly rather than spiritual justification for changing the calendar: wanting to &quot;party with everyone else&quot; at Christmas; concern that the gradual shift in the Julian calendar will somehow negatively affect the celebration of feasts that are linked to the seasons of the year. However, opponents counter that the seasons are reversed in the southern hemisphere, where the liturgical celebrations are no less valid. The validity of this argument is questionable, since the feasts of the Orthodox Church were not changed no matter where they were celebrated, and Orthodox services were held in the southern hemisphere with little issue centuries before the introduction of the new calendar.

From a spiritual perspective, Old Calendarists also point to a number of miraculous occurrences that occur on the old calendar exclusively, such as the &quot;descent of the cloud on the mount&quot; on the feast of the Transfiguration. After the calendar change was instituted, the followers of the old calendar in Greece apparently witnessed the appearance of a cross in the sky, visible to thousands on the feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, 1925, of which eyewitness accounts were recorded.

<doc id="26254" wikidata="Q7307437" url="?curid=26254" title="Reform of the date of Easter">
<text>Reform of the date of Easter refers to proposals to change the date for the annual celebration of Easter. These proposals include setting a fixed date or agreeing between Eastern and Western Christendom a common basis for calculating the date of Easter so that all Christians celebrate the Festival on the same day. As of 2024, no such agreement has been reached.

The term may also refer to historic reforms of the Computus, such as the adoption of the epact tables by Dionysius Exiguus in the 6th century and by Bede in the 8th century.

==Description==
A reform of the date of Easter has been proposed several times because the current system for determining the date of Easter is seen as presenting two significant problems:
# Its date varies from year to year. It can fall on up to 35 days in March and April of the respective calendar. While many Christians do not consider this to be a problem, it can cause frequent difficulties of co-ordination with civil calendars, for example academic terms. Many countries have public holidays around Easter weekend or tied to the date of Easter but spread from February to June, such as Shrove Tuesday or Ascension and Pentecost.
# Some Eastern churches (6 in total) calculate the date of Easter using the Julian calendar, whereas most Eastern churches use the Revised Julian calendar and all Western churches and civil authorities have adopted the Gregorian reforms for all calendrical purposes. Also a very few Eastern churches have adopted the Gregorian method of calculation. Hence in most years, Easter is celebrated on a later date in the East than in the West.

There have been controversies about the &quot;correct&quot; date of Easter since antiquity, but most Christian churches today agree on certain points. The Roman Catholic Church explains:

To justify his calendar reform, which involved removing ten days, in 1582 Pope Gregory XIII claimed that the council had decreed that Easter should be celebrated:
* on a Sunday,
* after the nominal Northward equinox – that is the start of spring in the Northern and of autumn in the Southern Hemisphere, fixed on 21 March in the Gregorian calendar –,
* after the first ecclesiastical full moon of the astronomical season.

There is less agreement whether Easter also should occur:
* so that Annunciation – celebrated 25 March, 9 months before Christmas – does not fall on any day from the Sunday before Easter to the Sunday after,
* on or after the 14th day of the lunar month of Nisan,
* not before Jewish Pesach – Easter is after Christian Passover by definition.

The disagreements have been particularly about the determination of moon phases and the equinox, some preferring astronomical observation from a certain location (usually Jerusalem, Alexandria, Rome or local), most others following nominal approximations of these in either the Hebrew, Julian or Gregorian calendar using different lookup tables and cycles in their algorithms. Deviations may also result from different customs for the start of the &quot;day&quot;, i.e. dusk, sunset, midnight, dawn or sunrise. Furthermore, it may be accepted to have the respective starts of the astronomical season, the full moon and the Sunday occur on the same date as long as they are observed in that order.

== Fixed date ==

It has been proposed that the first problem could be resolved by making Easter occur on a date fixed relative to the western Gregorian calendar every year, or alternatively on a Sunday within a fixed range of seven or eight dates. While tying Easter to one fixed date would serve to underline the belief that it commemorates an actual historical event, without an accompanying calendar reform that changes the pattern of the days of the week (itself a subject of religious controversy) or adopted a leap week, it would also break the tradition of Easter always being on a Sunday, established since the 2nd century and by now deeply embedded in the liturgical practice and theological understanding of almost all Christian denominations.

The Second Vatican Council agreed in 1963 to accept a fixed Sunday in the Gregorian calendar as the date for Easter as long as other Christian churches agreed on it as well. They also agreed in principle to adopt a civil calendar reform as long as there were never any days outside the cycle of seven days per week.
In 1977, some Eastern Orthodox representatives objected to separating the date of Easter from lunar phases.

The Montanists, a 5th-century sect, celebrated Easter on the Sunday following April 6 (in the Julian calendar). This is equivalent to the Sunday closest to April 9. The April 6 date was apparently arrived at because it was equivalent to the 14th of the month of Artemisios in an earlier calendar used in the area, hence, the 14th of the first month of spring.

The two most widespread proposals for fixing the date of Easter would set it on either the second Sunday in April (8 to 14, week 14 or 15), or the Sunday after the second Saturday in April (9 to 15). They only differ in years with dominical letter G or AG where 1 April is a Sunday. In both schemes, account has been taken of the fact that—in spite of the many difficulties in establishing the dates of the historical events involved—many scholars attribute a high degree of probability to Friday 7 April 30, as the date of the crucifixion of Jesus, which would make 9 April the date of the Resurrection. Another date which is supported by many scholars is 3 April 33, making 5 April the date of the Resurrection.

In the late 1920s and 1930s, this idea gained some momentum along with other calendar reform proposals, such as the International Fixed Calendar (IFC) and the World Calendar. In 1928, a law was passed in the United Kingdom authorising an Order in Council which would fix the date of Easter in that country as the Sunday after the second Saturday in April. However, this was never implemented, but remains a popular proposal at least within the Anglican Church. In an 2001 article for the WCC, Dagmar Heller, who was the only woman to participate in the 1997 Aleppo conference, states that Western churches previously preferred a &quot;third option&quot;, i.e. a fixed Sunday in April, but tried to accommodate Eastern churches by giving this up.

The Sunday of an ordinal ISO week &quot;n&quot; is also the &quot;n&quot;th Sunday of the year, except in A/AG, B/BA and C/CB years where it is the &quot;n&quot;+1st Sunday. Therefore, both major proposals put Easter on the 15th Sunday of the year. The exception to this is either in common years starting on Monday (G), where 8 April, i.e. the second Sunday in April, is the 14th Sunday of the year, or in leap years starting on Sunday (AG), where 15 April, i.e. the Sunday after the second Saturday in April, is the 16th Sunday of the year. That means, the Saturday-based rule approximates the 15th Sunday better.

The Sunday after the first Wednesday in April would always be in ISO week W14, except for leap years starting on Thursday (DC) where the week count is one higher than in otherwise equivalent common years after February. The Symmetry454 Calendar proposes a fixed date of Easter in week 14, which would agree with the aforementioned proposals in most years, but would be 1 week earlier in F/GF years (like the only deviation of the Pepuzite definition) and also in DC, D/ED and E/FE years.

The first possible Gregorian date for Easter, 22 March, is also one of the dates with (almost) fixed ISO week number, i.e. W12, which is usually also the week of the equinox a day or two earlier. If the 52 weeks of a usual year are grouped into 13 nominal lunation phases of 4 weeks each (similar to IFC), then the equinox week concludes the third of these months and the next nominal full moon in the middle of the month would occur on Sunday of W14, making it the fixed date for Passover. Easter Sunday would follow seven days later, in W15, which is between 11 and 18 April.

Since Candlemas, which traditionally concludes Christmastide, on 2 February is almost always in W05 – only in W06 if on a Monday – a W15 Easter would ensure the three pre-Lenten Sundays, i.e. Septuagesima, Sexagesima and Quinquagesima, existed in all years, and not more than these.



== Unified date ==

Proposals to resolve the second problem have made greater progress, but they are yet to be adopted.

An astronomical rule for Easter was proposed by the 1923 Pan-Orthodox Congress of Constantinople that also proposed the Revised Julian calendar: Easter was to be the Sunday after the midnight-to-midnight day at the meridian of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem (35° 13′ 47.2″ E or UT + 2h 20m 55s for the small dome) during which the first full moon after the vernal equinox occurs.

Although the instant of the full moon must occur after the instant of the vernal equinox, it may occur on the same day. If the full moon occurs on a Sunday, Easter is the following Sunday. This proposed astronomical rule was rejected by all Orthodox churches and was never considered by any Western church.

=== 1997 proposal ===
The World Council of Churches (WCC) proposed a reform of the method of determining the date of Easter at a summit in Aleppo, Syria, in 1997: Easter would be defined as the first Sunday following the first astronomical full moon following the astronomical vernal equinox, as determined from the meridian of Jerusalem. The reform would have been implemented starting in 2001, since in that year the Eastern and Western dates of Easter would coincide.

This reform has not been implemented. It would have relied mainly on the co-operation of the Eastern Orthodox Church, since the date of Easter would change for them immediately; whereas for the Western churches, the new system would not differ from that currently in use until 2019. However, Eastern Orthodox support was not forthcoming, and the reform failed. The much greater impact that this reform would have had on the Eastern churches in comparison with those of the West led some Orthodox to suspect that the WCC&#x27;s decision was an attempt by the West to impose its viewpoint unilaterally on the rest of the world under the guise of ecumenism. However, it could also be argued that it is fair to ask a significant change of Eastern Christians, as they would be simply making the same substantial changes the various Western Churches have already made in 1582 (when the Catholic Church first adopted the Gregorian calendar) and subsequent years so as to bring the calendar and Easter more in line with the seasons.

=== 2008–2009 proposals ===

In 2008 and 2009, there was a new attempt to reach a consensus on a unified date on the part of Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant leaders. This effort largely relies on earlier work carried out during the 1997 Aleppo conference. It was organized by academics working at the Institute of Ecumenical Studies of Lviv University.

Part of this attempt was reportedly influenced by ecumenical efforts in Syria and Lebanon, where the Greek-Melkite Church has played an important role in improving ties with the Orthodox. There is also a series of apparition phenomena known as Our Lady of Soufanieh that has urged for a common date of Easter.

=== 2014–present proposals ===

In May 2015, on the anniversary of the meeting between him and Pope Francis, Coptic Pope Tawadros II wrote a letter to Pope Francis asking for him to consider renewing effort at a unified date for Easter.

In response, on 12 June 2015, Catholic Pope Francis remarked to the International Catholic Charismatic Renewal Services 3rd World Retreat of Priests at the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome that &quot;we have to come to an agreement&quot; for a common date on Easter. , a historian, writing in the Vatican daily newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot;, said the Pope offered this initiative to change the date of Easter &quot;as a gift of unity with the other Christian churches&quot; adding that a common date for Easter would encourage &quot;reconciliation between the Christian churches and ... a sort of making sense out of the calendar&quot;. A week later Aphrem II, the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, met with Pope Francis and noted that the celebration of Easter &quot;on two different dates is a source of great discomfort and weakens the common witness of the church in the world.&quot;

In January 2016, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, announced that he on behalf of the Anglican Communion had joined discussions with Catholic, Coptic, and Orthodox representatives over a fixed date for Easter, and that he hoped it would happen within the next 5–10 years. Welby suggested that Easter be fixed on either the second or third Sunday of April, relative to the Gregorian calendar. This proposal remains to be approved, especially by Eastern churches, which currently determine Easter using the Julian calendar.

Statements in 2021 and 2025 by the Vatican and Orthodox churches state the goal to achieve consensus by 2025, just in time for the 1700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, but without publishing any specific plans or who would adopt which changes. The Faith and Order Commission of the World Council of Churches has arranged conferences to mark the event.

On November 10, 2022, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople stated that both the Orthodox and Catholic sides have a good intention to finally establish a common date for the celebration of Easter before the celebration of the 1700th anniversary of the First Council of Nicaea, which took place in 325; however, it was too early to talk about details. In 2024 he again called on &quot;Western and Eastern Christians to celebrate Easter on the same date, starting from 2025&quot;.

According to international standards, Easter Sunday ends the week containing Good Friday and the week of the second Sunday in April has the ordinal number 14 or 15 (dominical letters D/DC, E/ED, F/FE and GF, i.e. 46.25% of years), hence the third Sunday is one respective week later. There currently is no public proposal under discussion that used a fixed week of the year for Easter and dependent feasts. The second Sunday in April is usually the 15th Sunday of the year (except for dominical letter G, 10.75%), which is almost always also the Sunday after the second Saturday in April (except for dominical letter AG, 3.75%).

<doc id="26255" wikidata="Q739953" url="?curid=26255" title="Robert Lowth">
<text>Robert Lowth ( ; 27 November 1710 – 3 November 1787) was an English clergyman and academic who served as the Bishop of Oxford, Bishop of St Davids, Professor of Poetry and the author of one of the most influential textbooks of English grammar.

==Life==
Lowth was born in Hampshire, England, Great Britain, the son of Dr William Lowth, a clergyman and Biblical commentator. He was educated at Winchester College and became a scholar of New College, Oxford in 1729. Lowth obtained his BA in 1733 and his Master of Arts degree in 1737. In 1735, while still at Oxford, Lowth took orders in the Anglican Church and was appointed vicar of Ovington, Hampshire, a position he retained until 1741, when he was appointed Oxford Professor of Poetry.

Bishop Lowth made a translation of the Book of Isaiah, first published in 1778. The Seventh-day Adventist theologian E. J. Waggoner said in 1899 that Lowth&#x27;s translation of Isaiah was &quot;without doubt, as a whole, the best English translation of the prophecy of Isaiah&quot;.

In 1750 he was appointed Archdeacon of Winchester. In 1752 he resigned the professorship at Oxford and married Mary Jackson. Shortly afterwards, in 1753, Lowth was appointed rector of East Woodhay. In 1754 he was awarded a Doctorate in Divinity by Oxford University, for his treatise on Hebrew poetry entitled &quot;Praelectiones Academicae de Sacra Poesi Hebraeorum&quot; (&quot;On the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews&quot;). This derives from a series of lectures and was originally published in Latin. An English translation was published by George Gregory in 1787 as &quot;Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews&quot;. This and subsequent editions include the life of Bishop Lowth as a preface. There was a further edition issued in 1815. This was republished in North America in 1829 with some additional notes. However, apart from those notes, the 1829 edition is less useful to a modern reader. This is because the editor of that edition chose to revert to citing many of the scriptural passages that Lowth uses as examples, and some of the annotations by Michaelis) and others, in Latin.

Lowth was appointed a fellow of the Royal Societies of London and Göttingen in 1765. He was consecrated bishop of St Davids in Wales in 1766; however, before the end of the year he was translated to the English see of Oxford. He remained Bishop of Oxford until 1777 when he was appointed Bishop of London as well as dean of the chapel royal and privy councillor. In 1783 he was offered the chance to become Archbishop of Canterbury, but declined due to failing health.

Lowth was good friends with the Scottish Enlightenment figure David Hume, as noted by the prominent Scottish bookseller Andrew Millar. Millar commented that &quot;Hume and he are very great, tho&#x27; one orthodox and ye other Hedretox&quot;.

Lowth wrote a Latin epitaph, &quot;Cara, Vale&quot; (&quot;Dear one, farewell!&quot;) on the death of his daughter Maria. Much admired in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was set to music by the English composer John Wall Callcott.

Lowth died in 1787, and was buried in the churchyard of All Saints Church, Fulham. Lowth&#x27;s library was sold by auction by R. H. Evans on 15 January 1823 and five following days, along with the books of his son (also Robert, Rector of Hinton Ampnor, d. 1822). There is a copy of the catalogue at Cambridge University Library (shelfmark Munby.c.126(1)).

==Old Testament scholarship==
Lowth seems to have been the first modern Bible scholar to notice or draw attention to the poetic structure of the Psalms and much of the prophetic literature of the Old Testament. In Lecture 19 he sets out the classic statement of parallelism, which remains the most fundamental category for understanding Hebrew poetry. He identifies three forms of parallelism, the synonymous, antithetic and synthetic (i.e., balance only in the manner of expression without either synonymy or antithesis). This idea has been influential in Old Testament Studies to the present day.

==Work on English grammar==
Lowth is also remembered for his publication in 1762 of &quot;A Short Introduction to English Grammar&quot;. Prompted by the absence of simple and pedagogical grammar textbooks in his day, Lowth set out to remedy the situation. Lowth&#x27;s grammar is the source of many of the prescriptive shibboleths that are studied in schools, and established him as the first of a long line of usage commentators who judge the English language in addition to describing it. An example of both is one of his footnotes: &quot;&quot;Whose&quot; is by some authors made the possessive case of &quot;which&quot;, and applied to things as well as persons; I think, improperly.&quot;

His most famous contribution to the study of grammar may have been his tentative suggestion that sentences ending with a preposition—such as &quot;what did you ask for?&quot;—are inappropriate in formal writing. (This is known as preposition stranding.) In what may have been intentional self-reference, Lowth used that very construction in discussing it. &quot;This is an Idiom which our language is strongly inclined to; it prevails in common conversation, and suits very well with the familiar style in writing; but the placing of the Preposition before the Relative is more graceful, as well as more perspicuous; and agrees much better with the solemn and elevated Style.&quot;2 Others had previously expressed this opinion; the earliest known is John Dryden in 1672.

Lowth&#x27;s method included criticising &quot;false syntax&quot;; his examples of false syntax were culled from Shakespeare, the King James Bible, John Donne, John Milton, Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, and other famous writers. His understanding of grammar, like that of all linguists of his period, was influenced by the study of Latin, though he was aware that this was problematic and condemned &quot;forcing the English under the rules of a foreign Language&quot;1. Thus Lowth condemns Addison&#x27;s sentence &quot;Who should I meet the other night, but my old friend?&quot; on the grounds that the thing acted upon should be in the &quot;Objective Case&quot; (corresponding, as he says earlier, to an oblique case in Latin), rather than taking this example and others as evidence from noted writers that &quot;who&quot; can refer to direct objects.

Lowth&#x27;s dogmatic assertions appealed to those who wished for certainty and authority in their language. Lowth&#x27;s grammar was not written for children; however, within a decade after it appeared, versions of it adapted for the use of schools had appeared, and Lowth&#x27;s stylistic opinions acquired the force of law in the schoolroom. The textbook remained in standard usage throughout educational institutions until the early 20th century.
==Literary critic==
Lowth has been regarded as the first imagery critic of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and highlighted the importance of the imagery in the interpretation of motives and actions of characters and dramatic movement of the plot and narrative structure.3

<text>Sir Robert William Askin, GCMG (4 April 1907 – 9 September 1981), was an Australian politician and the 32nd premier of New South Wales from 1965 to 1975, the first representing the Liberal Party. He was born in 1907 as Robin William Askin, but always disliked his first name and changed it by deed poll in 1971. Before being knighted in 1972, however, he was generally known as Bob Askin. Born in Sydney in 1907, Askin was educated at Sydney Technical High School. After serving as a bank officer and as a sergeant in the Second World War, Askin joined the Liberal Party and was elected to the seat of Collaroy at the 1950 election.

Askin quickly rose through party ranks, eventually becoming deputy leader following Walter Howarth&#x27;s resignation in July 1954. When long-serving party leader Vernon Treatt announced his resignation in August 1954, Askin put his name forward to replace him. At the vote, he became deadlocked against Pat Morton and Askin asked his former commanding officer Murray Robson to take the leadership instead. Robson did not live up to expectations and was deposed in September 1955 by Morton, who then became leader. Askin remained as deputy until, after leading the party to a second electoral defeat in 1959, Morton was deposed and Askin was elected to succeed him. At the May 1965 election, Askin presented the Liberal Party as a viable alternative government. He won a narrow victory, ending a 24-year Labor hold on government.

Askin&#x27;s time in office was marked by a significant increase in public works programs, strong opposition to an increase in Commonwealth powers, laissez-faire economic policies and wide-ranging reforms in laws and regulations such as the Law Reform Commission, the introduction of consumer laws, legal aid, breath-testing of drivers, the liberalisation of liquor laws and the restoration of postal voting in NSW elections. More controversial changes included the 1967 abolition of Sydney City Council and increased rates of development in Sydney, often at the expense of architectural heritage and historic buildings. This culminated in the &#x27;Green ban&#x27; movement of the 1970s led by the union movement to conserve the heritage of Sydney.

At the end of his term, after winning another three elections, Askin was the second longest serving Premier of New South Wales (after Henry Parkes) and served the longest contiguous term of any premier. This record has since been overtaken by Neville Wran and Bob Carr. Askin remains the longest-serving Leader of the New South Wales Liberal Party. Since his death in 1981, however, Askin&#x27;s legacy has been tarnished by persistent allegations that he was involved in organised crime and official corruption.

==Early years==
Robin William Askin was born in Sydney, New South Wales on 4 April 1907, at the Crown Street Women&#x27;s Hospital, the eldest of three sons of Ellen Laura Halliday (née Rowe) and William James Askin, an Adelaide-born sailor and worker for New South Wales Railways. His parents later married on 29 September 1916. Askin spent his early years in Stuart Town before his family moved to Glebe, a working-class inner-city suburb of Sydney. After primary education at Glebe Public School, Askin was awarded a bursary to study at Sydney Technical High School, where he sat in the same class as the future aviator Charles Kingsford Smith. At school he gained good marks, with a particular interest in Mathematics and History, and enjoyed swimming and Rugby League. He completed his Intermediate Certificate in 1921.

At the age of 15, after a short time in the electrical trade, in 1922 Askin joined the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales as a Clerk. However, when the Savings Bank closed due to the Great Depression in 1931, he joined the Rural Bank of New South Wales. Between 1925 and 1929 Askin served part-time as a lieutenant in the 55th Battalion, Citizens Military Forces. On 5 February 1937 Askin married Mollie Isabelle Underhill, a typist at the bank, at Gilbert Park Methodist Church, Manly. They lived in Manly for the rest of their lives. He began his interest in politics by assisting in Percy Spender&#x27;s successful campaign for Askin&#x27;s local seat of Warringah as an Independent candidate at the 1937 Federal election. In 1940 Askin was appointed manager of the bank service department, which focused on public relations. He served as vice-president from 1939 to 1940 and president from 1940 to 1941 of the Rural Bank branch of the United Bank Officers&#x27; Association.

Askin enlisted as a private in the Second Australian Imperial Force on 30 March 1942. An instructor with the 14th Infantry Training Battalion at Dubbo, he was appointed acting corporal, then reverted to private. In November 1942 he joined the 2/31st Infantry Battalion in New Guinea, where he served for two months. He was in New Guinea for another six months from July 1943. Landing at Balikpapan, Borneo, in July 1945, Askin was promoted to sergeant under Lieutenant Colonel Murray Robson. When hostilities ceased, he unsuccessfully attempted to set up an import business in Bandjermasin. Returning to Australia in February 1946, he was demobilised on 22 March.

==Early political career==
Upon demobilisation, Askin returned to work at the Rural Bank, managing its travel department. However, his interest in politics arose again when he assisted his former commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Robson, in retaining his seat of Vaucluse at the 1947 state election for the newly formed Liberal Party, which Askin then joined. Rapidly rising through the party ranks, Askin soon became President of the Liberals&#x27; Manly branch and supported Bill Wentworth&#x27;s successful bid for the new seat of Mackellar at the 1949 election.

Askin gained preselection for and won the newly created seat of Collaroy, located in the Northern Beaches, at the 17 June 1950 election, gaining 63.69% of the vote. The leader of the Liberal Party since 1946, Vernon Treatt led the Liberal/Country Coalition at the election, which resulted in a hung parliament, with Treatt&#x27;s Coalition gaining 12 seats and a swing of 6.7% for a total of 46 seats. With the Labor Party also holding 46 seats, the balance of power lay with the two re-elected Independent Labor member, James Geraghty and John Seiffert, who had been expelled from the party for disloyalty during the previous parliament. Under a legalistic interpretation of the ALP rules, Seiffert was readmitted to the party and, together with the support of Geraghty, Premier James McGirr and Labor were able to stay in power. As the new local member for a constituency covering most of the Northern Beaches from North Manly to Pittwater, Askin protested against the lack of government development and services in the area, such as sewerage, education, and transport.

Labor&#x27;s near-defeat weakened McGirr&#x27;s position and he was replaced as premier by Joseph Cahill in April 1952. Cahill had won popular support as a vigorous and impressive minister who had resolved problems with New South Wales&#x27; electricity supply and in his first 10 months as premier had reinvigorated the party. He appeared decisive and brought order to the government&#x27;s chaotic public works program. In addition, he attacked the increasingly unpopular federal Coalition government of Robert Menzies. All this contributed to Treatt&#x27;s Coalition being defeated at the 14 February 1953 election, with a total loss of ten seats and a swing against them of 7.2%. Askin retained his seat with 63.35%.

===Deputy Leader===
With confidence in his leadership demolished, Treatt&#x27;s Liberal Party descended into factional in-fighting culminating in the resignation of Deputy Leader Walter Howarth on 22 July 1954, who publicly announced it on 4 July citing that he felt that Treatt doubted his loyalty. He was replaced by now-Party Whip Askin. The resignation split the party and sparked a leadership challenge from Pat Morton. At the party meeting on 6 July, Treatt narrowly defeated Morton with 12 votes to 10. With party support eroded, Treatt did not remain long as leader afterwards. On Friday 6 August 1954, Treatt announced that he would resign as leader. At the following party meeting, after a deadlocked vote between Askin and Morton, Askin asked his friend Murray Robson to nominate and subsequently he was elected to succeed Treatt.

Like other senior members of the party, after having no conservative government since Alexander Mair in 1941, Robson had no experience in government, had little interest in policy and alienated many party members by trying to forge a closer alliance with Michael Bruxner&#x27;s Country Party. Over a year after Robson assumed the leadership, at a party meeting on 20 September 1955, senior party member Ken McCaw moved that the leadership be declared vacant, citing that Robson&#x27;s leadership lacked the qualities necessary for winning the next election. The motion was carried 15 votes to 5. Morton was then elected unopposed as leader, with Askin remaining as deputy leader.

Morton then led the party to defeat at the election on 3 March 1956. The Coalition gained six seats, reducing the government&#x27;s majority from twenty to six. Askin retained Collaroy with 70.14%. Morton again led the opposition to the ballot at the 21 March 1959 election, which resulted in an overall gain of three seats but the loss of two seats to Labor. After counting was finalised the Cahill Government was left with an overall majority of four seats. Askin retained his seat with 71.09%.

==Leader of the Opposition==
Morton&#x27;s refusal to give up his many business interests while as leader led many to accuse him of being a &#x27;part-time leader&#x27; and together with his second election loss, eroded confidence in his leadership. On 14 July 1959, three Liberal MLAs called on Morton to resign, stating that the party needed a full-time leader and that Morton no longer commanded the majority support of his colleagues. Morton refused and instead called an emergency meeting on 17 July to confirm his leadership.

By this time, Askin had emerged as one of the main opponents to his longtime friend and former commander. However, he and the other major challenger to Morton&#x27;s leadership, Eric Willis declared that they would only take the leadership if they were given an absolute majority of 28 votes. At the party meeting, a spill motion to remove Morton as leader carried by two votes. Willis then surprised many by deciding not to put his name forward for nomination, leaving Askin to take the leadership unopposed. Willis was eventually elected as deputy leader. Upon election, Askin declared that &quot;One of my main tasks will be to sell our [Liberal Party] ideas and principles to the working man.&quot;

When Premier Cahill died on 22 October 1959, he was replaced by Askin&#x27;s friend and parliamentary contemporary, Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Heffron, which tended to calm his aggression and opposition towards the government. At the March 1962 election, Labor had been in power for 21 years and Heffron had since been Premier for 2 and a half years. Heffron was 72 at the time of the election and his age and the longevity of the government were made issues by the Askin&#x27;s opposition which described it as being composed of &quot;tired old men&quot;. The standing of Heffron&#x27;s government suffered when the electors rejected its proposal to abolish the New South Wales Legislative Council at a referendum in April 1961, being the first time Labor had lost a state electoral poll in 20 years. Askin&#x27;s successful opposition campaign centred on warning of a Labor-dominated single house subject to &quot;Communist and Trades Hall influence&quot;.

Labor&#x27;s policies for the election included the establishment of a Department of Industrial Development to reduce unemployment, free school travel, aid to home buyers and commencing the construction of the Sydney–Newcastle Freeway as a toll-road. By contrast, Askin put forward a wide-ranging program of reform and addressed contentious issues including the introduction of State Aid for private schools, making rent control fairer and the legalisation of off-course betting on horse races. Askin accused the state government of allowing the transport infrastructure of the state to decline and promised to build the Newcastle freeway without a toll, to construct the Eastern Suburbs Railway and to plan for a second crossing of Sydney Harbour. Askin also made promises for more resources in mental health and district hospitals.

Despite these promises, Askin and the new Country Party Leader, Charles Cutler, lost the election to Heffron, mainly due to the adverse reactions of voters towards the November 1960 &quot;horror budget&quot; and credit squeeze made by the federal Coalition government under Menzies. The Coalition lost five seats, despite a small swing of 0.16% and the Coalition gaining the support of prominent media businessman, Frank Packer, who helped project the image of Askin and the Liberals as a viable alternative government. Askin retained his seat with 72.53%.

The 1965 campaign against the Labor Government—led since April 1964 by Jack Renshaw—a government widely perceived to be tired and devoid of ideas, was notable for being one of Australia&#x27;s first &quot;presidential-style&quot; campaigns, with Askin being the major focus of campaigning and a main theme of &quot;With Askin You&#x27;ll Get Action&quot;.

He received vigorous support from the newspapers and TV stations owned by Packer. At the May 1965 election, the Liberal/Country Coalition gained 49.8% of the vote to 43.3% to the ALP. While the Liberals took only two seats from Labor, Askin got the support of the two independent members, Douglas Darby (Manly) and Harold Coates (Hartley), giving him enough support to end Labor&#x27;s 24-year run in power. He officially took office on 1 May, with Charles Cutler of the Country Party as deputy premier.

==Premier of New South Wales==
The Askin Government was sworn in by the governor of New South Wales, Sir Eric Woodward, on 13 May 1965 at Government House. It was the first to be headed by the Liberal Party since the main non-Labor party in the state adopted the Liberal banner; being one of only three Liberals to win power from Labor. Askin, who served as his own treasurer, heavily involved himself in the business of Government, while also maintaining a range of social agendas and regular outings to the racetrack or Rugby League games. One of the privileges of office was the access to a Ministerial car and personal driver, which became particularly important for Askin, who did not drive. On one occasion when Askin was supposed to drive a new Holden from the factory assembly line during a visit, Askin arranged for his driver, Russ Ferguson, to be hidden on the car floor working the controls while Askin held the wheel.

Askin&#x27;s government was marked by strong opposition to an increase in Commonwealth powers, a tough stance on &quot;law and order&quot; issues, laissez-faire economic policies, and aggressive support for industrial and commercial development. At his first Cabinet meeting, Askin restored direct air services between Sydney and Dubbo, and required Jørn Utzon, the Danish architect then working on the Sydney Opera House, to provide a final price and completion date for the Opera House, which had gone past the original estimates for both. His Public Works Minister Davis Hughes began to assert control over the project and demanded that costs be reined in. This brought him into direct conflict with Utzon and in February 1966, after a bitter standoff and the suspension of progress payments by Hughes, Utzon resigned, sparking a major public outcry. Two weeks after the first Government meeting, the Askin Government abolished the tow-away system for Sydney and Newcastle. In 1966 the University of New South Wales awarded him an honorary Doctor of Letters (D.Litt.).

===Law reform===
Despite a hostile Legislative Council, an extended drought and various industrial disputes, Askin and his Government passed several reforms. Among them were the removal of trading-hours restrictions on small businesses, abolishing juries for motor accident damage cases, extending the hours for liquor trading, thereby bringing an end to the &quot;Six o&#x27;clock swill&quot;. The Government also moved into legal and local government reforms, attacking pollution and restoring the previously abolished postal voting rights in state elections. Askin also addressed the demands of the New England New State Movement by holding a referendum in 1967, which was defeated by a large margin.

Many of his government&#x27;s reforms were due to his minister for justice, John Maddison, and Attorney-General Sir Kenneth McCaw, who initiated the establishment of the Law Reform Commission of New South Wales, the introduction of consumer laws, an ombudsman, legal aid, health labels on cigarette packs, breath-testing of drivers, limits on vehicle emissions, the liberalisation of liquor laws, and compensation for victims of violent crime. There was also a new National Parks and Wildlife Service to assist environment conservation and protection. Despite these positive reforms, Askin&#x27;s government maintained a brutal prison and corrective regime that was to culminate in the Bathurst Gaol riots in 1970 and 1974.

===Local government and planning===

Askin, along with his minister for local government, Pat Morton, oversaw the rapid escalation of building development in inner-city Sydney and the central business district, which followed in the wake of his controversial 1967 abolition of Sydney City Council and a redistribution of municipal electoral boundaries that was aimed at reducing the power of the rival Labor Party. On its abolition, Morton commented that it was &quot;essential for Sydney&#x27;s progress&quot; and replaced the city council with a commission, headed by another former Liberal leader, Vernon Treatt.

The Sydney metropolitan area at the time was marked by increasing strains on state infrastructure and Askin&#x27;s Government&#x27;s pro-development stance was largely attributed as an attempt to alleviate these problems. Despite this, the newly established State Planning Authority were continuously criticised for not being totally accountable to the public, particularly as the pro-business Sydney Commissioners worked side by side with the Planning authority to increase developments in the Sydney CBD to their highest levels ever, embodied by the construction of the MLC Centre, the demolition of the Theatre Royal, Sydney and the Australia Hotel. Other controversial schemes proposed by his government were a massive freeway system that was planned to be driven through the hearts of historic inner-city suburbs including Glebe and Newtown and an equally ambitious scheme of &#x27;slum clearance&#x27; that would have brought about the wholescale destruction of the historic areas of Woolloomooloo and The Rocks. This eventually culminated in the 1970s Green ban movement led by Unions Leader Jack Mundey, to protect the architectural heritage of Sydney.

===Second term===
At the 24 February 1968 election, Askin increased his previously tenuous majority, scoring a six-seat swing against Labor&#x27;s Renshaw and an overall majority of 12 over the Labor Party and the two Independents. Askin retained his seat with 70.97%. It was the first time since the UAP/Country Coalition won three consecutive elections from 1932 to 1938 that a non-Labor government in New South Wales had been reelected.

In mid-1968 Askin famously became embroiled in a media controversy over the reporting of several words spoken to the United States Chamber of Commerce lunch in Sydney on 32 July 1968 (also the day Opposition Leader Renshaw resigned, to be replaced by Pat Hills), in which he spoke of the October 1966 state visit by United States president Lyndon B. Johnson. Askin had joined Prime Minister Harold Holt, President Johnson and the American ambassador, Ed Clark, in a drive through the Sydney CBD. As Johnson&#x27;s motorcade drove into Liverpool Street, several anti-Vietnam War protesters, including Graeme Dunstan, threw themselves in front of the car carrying them. As Askin later recalled, a police officer had informed him that some communists were obstructing the route. Askin claimed he had instructed the officer to drag them off. As the car moved on, he then said to Johnson &quot;half-jocularly&quot;: &quot;what I ought to have told him was to ride over them&quot;, to which Johnson replied &quot;a man after my own heart&quot;. At the subsequent luncheon, Askin instead reported that he had said the remark to the police officer, which a journalist attending the event later reported it as &quot;Run over the bastards.&quot;

===Federal relations===

As Treasurer, Askin focused on the state budget and on Commonwealth-State financial relations. His attitude towards the Commonwealth and the Federal Government was shaped by his first premiers&#x27; conference in 1965 when Prime Minister Menzies negotiated with the Victorian premier Henry Bolte to achieve an extra grant of funds for Victoria at the expense of the other states and closed the conference before the other Premiers could object. At subsequent premiers&#x27; conferences he opposed the &#x27;centralising&#x27; tendencies of Canberra and became a strong advocate of the rights of the states.

With John Gorton becoming prime minister after Holt&#x27;s death, Askin came into conflict with the Commonwealth Government over Gorton&#x27;s determination to maintain federal command over taxation and in June 1968 declared that he could veto any form of state taxation. In late 1969, Askin, with Bolte, organised an &#x27;emergency&#x27; premiers&#x27; conference, without Gorton, to publicise the disadvantages of the States, a move that was partly responsible for the party deposition of Gorton in 1971.

Askin had a greater dislike for Gorton&#x27;s successor, William McMahon and received financial support from McMahon only when Askin threatened to release a NSW &quot;horror budget&quot; that could damage Federal Liberal voting intentions. However, when McMahon lost the 1972 election to Labor Leader Gough Whitlam, relations between Sydney and Canberra got even worse. Whitlam&#x27;s centralising economic policies and decision to end legal appeals to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council drew criticism from Askin.

===Third and Fourth terms===
At the 13 February 1971 state election, the Coalition suffered a swing of four seats, but still managed a narrow win against Labor and new leader Pat Hills, taking 49 seats – a bare majority of one – in the expanded 96-seat Legislative Assembly.

Throughout his time as premier, Askin was assisted by Charles Cutler as deputy premier and leader of the Country Party. Cutler served as acting premier at times when Askin was suffering from illness, having suffered two heart attacks in 1969 and 1973. In 1972 the Eastern Orthodox Church of Antioch presented Askin with the Order of St Peter and St Paul for his services to ethnic minorities.

In 1971 Askin changed his name from &quot;Robin&quot; to &quot;Robert&quot; by a deed poll. On 1 January 1972, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG). Later that year, taking advantage of unease at the increasingly erratic Labor government of Gough Whitlam and the increasing economic problems seen to be caused by it, Askin called an early election for 1973. A setback arose for the government in the northern Sydney seat of Gordon, when the Liberal member and education minister, Harry Jago, forgot to lodge a formal nomination of his candidacy. This resulted in the Liberals losing the seat to the Democratic Labor Party before the election took place. Nevertheless, Askin&#x27;s government went to a record fourth win against the ALP (still led by Pat Hills), increasing the Liberal/Country majority by four seats and making Askin the only major party leader to win four consecutive terms for premier until Neville Wran of the ALP. At this election, Askin ran in Pittwater, essentially a reconfigured version of his old seat of Collaroy, which had been abolished in a redistribution. Pittwater was as safely Liberal as Collaroy, and Askin retained it easily. In 1973 he was appointed an Officer of the Lebanese National Order of the Cedar.

Askin&#x27;s last term in office was marked by tension between the NSW and Victorian Governments, and by a widespread view that Askin was getting out of touch with the voters. Late in 1974, Askin announced his resignation, and his last intervention was to support his minister for lands, Thomas Lewis, in his bid to be Askin&#x27;s successor instead of the deputy leader and minister for education, Sir Eric Willis. It was reported that Lewis had offered to upgrade Askin&#x27;s knighthood from Knight Commander (KCMG) to Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) of the Order of St Michael and St George, while Willis was uncommitted on the topic. In any event, Askin retired from politics in January 1975 and was succeeded by Lewis as premier. On 14 June 1975 he was elevated to Knight Grand Cross, for his service as premier.

The departure of Askin began a turbulent year for the government. Lewis was ousted in a party room coup by Willis in 1976, but Willis only lasted four months before losing the 1976 election to Labor, ending the longest unbroken run for a non-Labor government since World War I.

== Later life ==
Askin&#x27;s health declined still further after 1975, and he died of heart failure on 9 September 1981 in St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital, Sydney. The next day, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; editorialised that he was &quot;one of the ablest, most industrious and colourful political leaders of Australia&#x27;s post-war era&quot;.

His state funeral, held on 14 September, was attended by over 1,000 mourners, including Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, Premier Neville Wran, Mervyn Wood, Justice Lionel Murphy and former NSW Labor Premier and former governor-general Sir William McKell.

==Allegations of corruption==
There have been persistent allegations that Askin, allegedly assisted by then Police Commissioner Norman Allan, oversaw the creation of a lucrative network of corruption and bribery that involved politicians, public servants, police, and the nascent Sydney organised crime syndicates.

When questioned about his wealth, Askin always attributed it to the salary from his high public office, his frugal lifestyle, good investments and canny punting. After his death the Australian Taxation Office audited his estate and, although it made no finding of criminality, it determined that a substantial part of it came from undisclosed income derived from sources other than shares or gambling.

With Askin&#x27;s death in 1981, investigative journalists were freed from the threat of legal action under Australia&#x27;s defamation laws. Stories about his reputed corruption were published almost immediately. Most notable of those was an article that appeared in &quot;The National Times&quot; co-written by David Marr and David Hickie. Headlined &quot;Askin: friend of organised crime&quot;, it was published on the day of Askin&#x27;s funeral. That was followed by David Hickie&#x27;s book &quot;The Prince and The Premier&quot;, which detailed Askin&#x27;s long involvement in illegal bookmaking, and allegations that he had received substantial and long-running payoffs from organised crime figures.

In 2007, the centenary of Askin&#x27;s birth, went largely unnoticed, with the Liberal Party distancing itself from him.

The allegations of corruption against Askin were revived in 2008 when Alan Saffron, the son of the late Sydney crime boss Abe Saffron, published a biography of his father in which he alleged that Saffron had paid bribes to major public officials, including Askin, former police commissioner Norman Allan, and other leading figures, whom he claimed he could not name because they were still alive. Alan Saffron alleged that his father made payments of between A$5000 and $10,000 per week to both men over many years, that Askin and Allan both visited Saffron&#x27;s office on several occasions, that Allan also visited the Saffron family home, and that Abe Saffron paid for an all-expenses overseas trip for Allan and a young female &quot;friend&quot;. He also alleged that, later in Askin&#x27;s premiership, Abe Saffron became the &quot;bagman&quot; for Sydney&#x27;s illegal liquor and prostitution rackets, and most illegal gambling activities, collecting payoffs that were then passed to Askin, Allan and others, in return for which his father was completely protected.

<text>In physics, a redshift is an increase in the wavelength, and corresponding decrease in the frequency and photon energy, of electromagnetic radiation (such as light). The opposite change, a decrease in wavelength and increase in frequency and energy, is known as a blueshift, or negative redshift. The terms derive from the colours red and blue which form the extremes of the visible light spectrum. The main causes of electromagnetic redshift in astronomy and cosmology are the relative motions of radiation sources, which give rise to the relativistic Doppler effect, and gravitational potentials, which gravitationally redshift escaping radiation. All sufficiently distant light sources show cosmological redshift corresponding to recession speeds proportional to their distances from Earth, a fact known as Hubble&#x27;s law that implies the universe is expanding.

All redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. Gravitational waves, which also travel at the speed of light, are subject to the same redshift phenomena. The value of a redshift is often denoted by the letter , corresponding to the fractional change in wavelength (positive for redshifts, negative for blueshifts), and by the wavelength ratio (which is greater than 1 for redshifts and less than 1 for blueshifts).

Examples of strong redshifting are a gamma ray perceived as an X-ray, or initially visible light perceived as radio waves. Subtler redshifts are seen in the spectroscopic observations of astronomical objects, and are used in terrestrial technologies such as Doppler radar and radar guns.

Other physical processes exist that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are distinguishable from (astronomical) redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer).

==History==
The history of the subject began in the 19th century, with the development of classical wave mechanics and the exploration of phenomena which are associated with the Doppler effect. The effect is named after the Austrian mathematician, Christian Doppler, who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842. In 1845, the hypothesis was tested and confirmed for sound waves by the Dutch scientist Christophorus Buys Ballot. Doppler correctly predicted that the phenomenon would apply to all waves and, in particular, suggested that the varying colors of stars could be attributed to their motion with respect to the Earth. Before this was verified, it was found that stellar colors were primarily due to a star&#x27;s temperature, not motion. Only later was Doppler vindicated by verified redshift observations.

The Doppler redshift was first described by French physicist Hippolyte Fizeau in 1848, who noted the shift in spectral lines seen in stars as being due to the Doppler effect. The effect is sometimes called the &quot;Doppler–Fizeau effect&quot;. In 1868, British astronomer William Huggins was the first to determine the velocity of a star moving away from the Earth by the method. In 1871, optical redshift was confirmed when the phenomenon was observed in Fraunhofer lines, using solar rotation, about 0.1 Å in the red. In 1887, Vogel and Scheiner discovered the &quot;annual Doppler effect&quot;, the yearly change in the Doppler shift of stars located near the ecliptic, due to the orbital velocity of the Earth. In 1901, Aristarkh Belopolsky verified optical redshift in the laboratory using a system of rotating mirrors.
In the earlier part of the twentieth century, Slipher, Wirtz and others made the first measurements of the redshifts and blueshifts of galaxies beyond the Milky Way. They initially interpreted these redshifts and blueshifts as being due to random motions, but later Lemaître (1927) and Hubble (1929), using previous data, discovered a roughly linear correlation between the increasing redshifts of, and distances to, galaxies. Lemaître realized that these observations could be explained by a mechanism of producing redshifts seen in Friedmann&#x27;s solutions to Einstein&#x27;s equations of general relativity. The correlation between redshifts and distances arises in all expanding models.

Beginning with observations in 1912, Vesto Slipher discovered that most spiral galaxies, then mostly thought to be spiral nebulae, had considerable redshifts. Slipher first reported on his measurement in the inaugural volume of the &quot;Lowell Observatory Bulletin&quot;. Three years later, he wrote a review in the journal &quot;Popular Astronomy&quot;. In it he stated that &quot;the early discovery that the great Andromeda spiral had the quite exceptional velocity of –300 km(/s) showed the means then available, capable of investigating not only the spectra of the spirals but their velocities as well.&quot; 

Slipher reported the velocities for 15 spiral nebulae spread across the entire celestial sphere, all but three having observable &quot;positive&quot; (that is recessional) velocities. Subsequently, Edwin Hubble discovered an approximate relationship between the redshifts of such &quot;nebulae&quot;, and the distances to them, with the formulation of his eponymous Hubble&#x27;s law. Milton Humason worked on those observations with Hubble. These observations corroborated Alexander Friedmann&#x27;s 1922 work, in which he derived the Friedmann–Lemaître equations. They are now considered to be strong evidence for an expanding universe and the Big Bang theory.

Arthur Eddington used the term &quot;red-shift&quot; as early as 1923, although the word does not appear unhyphenated until about 1934, when Willem de Sitter used it.

==Measurement, characterization, and interpretation==
The spectrum of light that comes from a source (see idealized spectrum illustration top-right) can be measured. To determine the redshift, one searches for features in the spectrum such as absorption lines, emission lines, or other variations in light intensity. If found, these features can be compared with known features in the spectrum of various chemical compounds found in experiments where that compound is located on Earth. A very common atomic element in space is hydrogen. 

The spectrum of originally featureless light shone through hydrogen will show a signature spectrum specific to hydrogen that has features at regular intervals. If restricted to absorption lines it would look similar to the illustration (top right). If the same pattern of intervals is seen in an observed spectrum from a distant source but occurring at shifted wavelengths, it can be identified as hydrogen too. If the same spectral line is identified in both spectra—but at different wavelengths—then the redshift can be calculated using the table below.

Determining the redshift of an object in this way requires a frequency or wavelength range. In order to calculate the redshift, one has to know the wavelength of the emitted light in the rest frame of the source: in other words, the wavelength that would be measured by an observer located adjacent to and comoving with the source. Since in astronomical applications this measurement cannot be done directly, because that would require traveling to the distant star of interest, the method using spectral lines described here is used instead. Redshifts cannot be calculated by looking at unidentified features whose rest-frame frequency is unknown, or with a spectrum that is featureless or white noise (random fluctuations in a spectrum).

Redshift (and blueshift) may be characterized by the relative difference between the observed and emitted wavelengths (or frequency) of an object. In astronomy, it is customary to refer to this change using a dimensionless quantity called . If represents wavelength and represents frequency (note, where is the speed of light), then is defined by the equations:

After is measured, the distinction between redshift and blueshift is simply a matter of whether is positive or negative. For example, Doppler effect blueshifts () are associated with objects approaching (moving closer to) the observer with the light shifting to greater energies. Conversely, Doppler effect redshifts () are associated with objects receding (moving away) from the observer with the light shifting to lower energies. Likewise, gravitational blueshifts are associated with light emitted from a source residing within a weaker gravitational field as observed from within a stronger gravitational field, while gravitational redshifting implies the opposite conditions.

== Physical origins ==
Redshifts are commonly attributed to relative motion between the source and the observer, to the expansion of the universe, and to gravity. These origins are fundamentally all equivalent, but they refer to different contexts. The following sections explain these origins.

===Doppler effect===


If a source of the light is moving away from an observer, then redshift () occurs; if the source moves towards the observer, then blueshift () occurs. This is true for all electromagnetic waves and is explained by the Doppler effect. Consequently, this type of redshift is called the &quot;Doppler redshift&quot;. If the source moves away from the observer with velocity , which is much less than the speed of light (), the redshift is given by

:formula_1 (since formula_2)

where is the speed of light. In the classical Doppler effect, the frequency of the source is not modified, but the recessional motion causes the illusion of a lower frequency.

A more complete treatment of the Doppler redshift requires considering relativistic effects associated with motion of sources close to the speed of light. A complete derivation of the effect can be found in the article on the relativistic Doppler effect. In brief, objects moving close to the speed of light will experience deviations from the above formula due to the time dilation of special relativity which can be corrected for by introducing the Lorentz factor into the classical Doppler formula as follows (for motion solely in the line of sight):

:formula_3

This phenomenon was first observed in a 1938 experiment performed by Herbert E. Ives and G.R. Stilwell, called the Ives–Stilwell experiment.

Since the Lorentz factor is dependent only on the magnitude of the velocity, this causes the redshift associated with the relativistic correction to be independent of the orientation of the source movement. In contrast, the classical part of the formula is dependent on the projection of the movement of the source into the line-of-sight which yields different results for different orientations. If is the angle between the direction of relative motion and the direction of emission in the observer&#x27;s frame (zero angle is directly away from the observer), the full form for the relativistic Doppler effect becomes:

:formula_4

and for motion solely in the line of sight (), this equation reduces to:

:formula_5

For the special case that the light is moving at right angle () to the direction of relative motion in the observer&#x27;s frame, the relativistic redshift is known as the transverse redshift, and a redshift:

:formula_6

is measured, even though the object is not moving away from the observer. Even when the source is moving towards the observer, if there is a transverse component to the motion then there is some speed at which the dilation just cancels the expected blueshift and at higher speed the approaching source will be redshifted.

===Cosmic expansion===
The observations of increasing redshifts from more and more distant galaxies can be modeled assuming a homogeneous and isotropic universe combined with general relativity. This cosmological redshift can be written as a function of , the time-dependent cosmic scale factor:
:formula_7

The scale factor is monotonically increasing as time passes. Thus is positive, close to zero for local stars, and increasing for distant galaxies that appear redshifted.

Using a model of the expansion of the universe, redshift can be related to the age of an observed object, the so-called &quot;cosmic time–redshift relation&quot;. Denote a density ratio as :

:formula_8

with the critical density demarcating a universe that eventually crunches from one that simply expands. This density is about three hydrogen atoms per cubic meter of space. At large redshifts, , one finds:

:formula_9

where is the present-day Hubble constant, and is the redshift.

The cosmological redshift is commonly attributed to stretching of the wavelengths of photons due to the stretching of space. This interpretation can be misleading. 
As required by general relativity, the cosmological expansion of space has no effect on local physics. There is no term related to expansion in Maxwell&#x27;s equations that govern light propagation. The cosmological redshift can be interpreted as an accumulation of infinitesimal Doppler shifts along the trajectory of the light.

There are several websites for calculating various times and distances from redshift, as the precise calculations require numerical integrals for most values of the parameters.

====Distinguishing between cosmological and local effects====
For cosmological redshifts of additional Doppler redshifts and blueshifts due to the peculiar motions of the galaxies relative to one another cause a wide scatter from the standard Hubble Law. The resulting situation can be illustrated by the Expanding Rubber Sheet Universe, a common cosmological analogy used to describe the expansion of the universe. If two objects are represented by ball bearings and spacetime by a stretching rubber sheet, the Doppler effect is caused by rolling the balls across the sheet to create peculiar motion. The cosmological redshift occurs when the ball bearings are stuck to the sheet and the sheet is stretched.

The redshifts of galaxies include both a component related to recessional velocity from expansion of the universe, and a component related to peculiar motion (Doppler shift). The redshift due to expansion of the universe depends upon the recessional velocity in a fashion determined by the cosmological model chosen to describe the expansion of the universe, which is very different from how Doppler redshift depends upon local velocity. Describing the cosmological expansion origin of redshift, cosmologist Edward Robert Harrison said, &quot;Light leaves a galaxy, which is stationary in its local region of space, and is eventually received by observers who are stationary in their own local region of space. Between the galaxy and the observer, light travels through vast regions of expanding space. As a result, all wavelengths of the light are stretched by the expansion of space. It is as simple as that...&quot; Steven Weinberg clarified, &quot;The increase of wavelength from emission to absorption of light does not depend on the rate of change of [the scale factor] at the times of emission or absorption, but on the increase of in the whole period from emission to absorption.&quot;

If the universe were contracting instead of expanding, we would see distant galaxies blueshifted by an amount proportional to their distance instead of redshifted.

===Gravitational redshift===

In the theory of general relativity, there is time dilation within a gravitational well. This is known as the gravitational redshift or &quot;Einstein Shift&quot;. The theoretical derivation of this effect follows from the Schwarzschild solution of the Einstein equations which yields the following formula for redshift associated with a photon traveling in the gravitational field of an uncharged, nonrotating, spherically symmetric mass:

:formula_10

where
* is the gravitational constant,
* is the mass of the object creating the gravitational field,
* is the radial coordinate of the source (which is analogous to the classical distance from the center of the object, but is actually a Schwarzschild coordinate), and
* is the speed of light.

This gravitational redshift result can be derived from the assumptions of special relativity and the equivalence principle; the full theory of general relativity is not required.

The effect is very small but measurable on Earth using the Mössbauer effect and was first observed in the Pound–Rebka experiment. However, it is significant near a black hole, and as an object approaches the event horizon the red shift becomes infinite. It is also the dominant cause of large angular-scale temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background radiation (see Sachs–Wolfe effect).

=== Summary table ===
Several important special-case formulae for redshift in certain special spacetime geometries, as summarized in the following table. In all cases the magnitude of the shift (the value of ) is independent of the wavelength.

==Observations in astronomy==
The redshift observed in astronomy can be measured because the emission and absorption spectra for atoms are distinctive and well known, calibrated from spectroscopic experiments in laboratories on Earth. When the redshift of various absorption and emission lines from a single astronomical object is measured, is found to be remarkably constant. Although distant objects may be slightly blurred and lines broadened, it is by no more than can be explained by thermal or mechanical motion of the source. For these reasons and others, the consensus among astronomers is that the redshifts they observe are due to some combination of the three established forms of Doppler-like redshifts. Alternative hypotheses and explanations for redshift such as tired light are not generally considered plausible.

Spectroscopy, as a measurement, is considerably more difficult than simple photometry, which measures the brightness of astronomical objects through certain filters. When photometric data is all that is available (for example, the Hubble Deep Field and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field), astronomers rely on a technique for measuring photometric redshifts. Due to the broad wavelength ranges in photometric filters and the necessary assumptions about the nature of the spectrum at the light-source, errors for these sorts of measurements can range up to , and are much less reliable than spectroscopic determinations. 

However, photometry does at least allow a qualitative characterization of a redshift. For example, if a Sun-like spectrum had a redshift of , it would be brightest in the infrared(1000nm) rather than at the blue-green(500nm) color associated with the peak of its blackbody spectrum, and the light intensity will be reduced in the filter by a factor of four, . Both the photon count rate and the photon energy are redshifted. (See K correction for more details on the photometric consequences of redshift.)

===Local observations===
In nearby objects (within our Milky Way galaxy) observed redshifts are almost always related to the line-of-sight velocities associated with the objects being observed. Observations of such redshifts and blueshifts have enabled astronomers to measure velocities and parametrize the masses of the orbiting stars in spectroscopic binaries, a method first employed in 1868 by British astronomer William Huggins. Similarly, small redshifts and blueshifts detected in the spectroscopic measurements of individual stars are one way astronomers have been able to diagnose and measure the presence and characteristics of planetary systems around other stars and have even made very detailed differential measurements of redshifts during planetary transits to determine precise orbital parameters. 

Finely detailed measurements of redshifts are used in helioseismology to determine the precise movements of the photosphere of the Sun. Redshifts have also been used to make the first measurements of the rotation rates of planets, velocities of interstellar clouds, the rotation of galaxies, and the dynamics of accretion onto neutron stars and black holes which exhibit both Doppler and gravitational redshifts. The temperatures of various emitting and absorbing objects can be obtained by measuring Doppler broadening—effectively redshifts and blueshifts over a single emission or absorption line. By measuring the broadening and shifts of the 21-centimeter hydrogen line in different directions, astronomers have been able to measure the recessional velocities of interstellar gas, which in turn reveals the rotation curve of our Milky Way. Similar measurements have been performed on other galaxies, such as Andromeda. As a diagnostic tool, redshift measurements are one of the most important spectroscopic measurements made in astronomy.

===Extragalactic observations===

The most distant objects exhibit larger redshifts corresponding to the Hubble flow of the universe. The largest-observed redshift, corresponding to the greatest distance and furthest back in time, is that of the cosmic microwave background radiation; the numerical value of its redshift is about ( corresponds to present time), and it shows the state of the universe about 13.8 billion years ago, and 379,000 years after the initial moments of the Big Bang.

The luminous point-like cores of quasars were the first &quot;high-redshift&quot; () objects discovered before the improvement of telescopes allowed for the discovery of other high-redshift galaxies.

For galaxies more distant than the Local Group and the nearby Virgo Cluster, but within a thousand megaparsecs or so, the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy&#x27;s distance. This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and has come to be known as Hubble&#x27;s law. Vesto Slipher was the first to discover galactic redshifts, in about 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher&#x27;s measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his Law. Hubble&#x27;s law follows in part from the Copernican principle. Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are, measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements, so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble&#x27;s law.

Gravitational interactions of galaxies with each other and clusters cause a significant scatter in the normal plot of the Hubble diagram. The peculiar velocities associated with galaxies superimpose a rough trace of the mass of virialized objects in the universe. This effect leads to such phenomena as nearby galaxies (such as the Andromeda Galaxy) exhibiting blueshifts as we fall towards a common barycenter, and redshift maps of clusters showing a fingers of god effect due to the scatter of peculiar velocities in a roughly spherical distribution. This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the mass-to-light ratio (the ratio of a galaxy&#x27;s mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities), an important tool for measuring dark matter.

The Hubble law&#x27;s linear relationship between distance and redshift assumes that the rate of expansion of the universe is constant. However, when the universe was much younger, the expansion rate, and thus the Hubble &quot;constant&quot;, was larger than it is today. For more distant galaxies, then, whose light has been travelling to us for much longer times, the approximation of constant expansion rate fails, and the Hubble law becomes a non-linear integral relationship and dependent on the history of the expansion rate since the emission of the light from the galaxy in question. Observations of the redshift-distance relationship can be used, then, to determine the expansion history of the universe and thus the matter and energy content.

While it was long believed that the expansion rate has been continuously decreasing since the Big Bang, observations beginning in 1988 of the redshift-distance relationship using Type Ia supernovae have suggested that in comparatively recent times the expansion rate of the universe has begun to accelerate.

===Highest redshifts===

Currently, the objects with the highest known redshifts are galaxies and the objects producing gamma ray bursts. The most reliable redshifts are from spectroscopic data, and the highest-confirmed spectroscopic redshift of a galaxy is that of JADES-GS-z14-0 with a redshift of , corresponding to 290 million years after the Big Bang. The previous record was held by GN-z11, with a redshift of , corresponding to 400 million years after the Big Bang, and by UDFy-38135539 at a redshift of , corresponding to 600 million years after the Big Bang. 

Slightly less reliable are Lyman-break redshifts, the highest of which is the lensed galaxy A1689-zD1 at a redshift and the next highest being . The most distant-observed gamma-ray burst with a spectroscopic redshift measurement was GRB 090423, which had a redshift of . The most distant-known quasar, ULAS J1342+0928, is at . The highest-known redshift radio galaxy (TGSS1530) is at a redshift and the highest-known redshift molecular material is the detection of emission from the CO molecule from the quasar SDSS J1148+5251 at .

&quot;Extremely red objects&quot; (EROs) are astronomical sources of radiation that radiate energy in the red and near infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. These may be starburst galaxies that have a high redshift accompanied by reddening from intervening dust, or they could be highly redshifted elliptical galaxies with an older (and therefore redder) stellar population. Objects that are even redder than EROs are termed &quot;hyper extremely red objects&quot; (HEROs).

The cosmic microwave background has a redshift of , corresponding to an age of approximately 379,000 years after the Big Bang and a proper distance of more than 46 billion light-years. The yet-to-be-observed first light from the oldest Population III stars, not long after atoms first formed and the CMB ceased to be absorbed almost completely, may have redshifts in the range of . Other high-redshift events predicted by physics but not presently observable are the cosmic neutrino background from about two seconds after the Big Bang (and a redshift in excess of ) and the cosmic gravitational wave background emitted directly from inflation at a redshift in excess of .

In June 2015, astronomers reported evidence for Population III stars in the Cosmos Redshift 7 galaxy at . Such stars are likely to have existed in the very early universe (i.e., at high redshift), and may have started the production of chemical elements heavier than hydrogen that are needed for the later formation of planets and life as we know it.

===Redshift surveys===
With advent of automated telescopes and improvements in spectroscopes, a number of collaborations have been made to map the universe in redshift space. By combining redshift with angular position data, a redshift survey maps the 3D distribution of matter within a field of the sky. These observations are used to measure properties of the large-scale structure of the universe. The Great Wall, a vast supercluster of galaxies over 500 million light-years wide, provides a dramatic example of a large-scale structure that redshift surveys can detect.

The first redshift survey was the CfA Redshift Survey, started in 1977 with the initial data collection completed in 1982. More recently, the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey determined the large-scale structure of one section of the universe, measuring redshifts for over 220,000 galaxies; data collection was completed in 2002, and the final data set was released 30 June 2003. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), is ongoing as of 2013 and aims to measure the redshifts of around 3 million objects. SDSS has recorded redshifts for galaxies as high as 0.8, and has been involved in the detection of quasars beyond . The DEEP2 Redshift Survey uses the Keck telescopes with the new &quot;DEIMOS&quot; spectrograph; a follow-up to the pilot program DEEP1, DEEP2 is designed to measure faint galaxies with redshifts 0.7 and above, and it is therefore planned to provide a high-redshift complement to SDSS and 2dF.

==Effects from physical optics or radiative transfer==
The interactions and phenomena summarized in the subjects of radiative transfer and physical optics can result in shifts in the wavelength and frequency of electromagnetic radiation. In such cases, the shifts correspond to a physical energy transfer to matter or other photons rather than being by a transformation between reference frames. Such shifts can be from such physical phenomena as coherence effects or the scattering of electromagnetic radiation whether from charged elementary particles, from particulates, or from fluctuations of the index of refraction in a dielectric medium as occurs in the radio phenomenon of radio whistlers. While such phenomena are sometimes referred to as &quot;redshifts&quot; and &quot;blueshifts&quot;, in astrophysics light-matter interactions that result in energy shifts in the radiation field are generally referred to as &quot;reddening&quot; rather than &quot;redshifting&quot; which, as a term, is normally reserved for the effects discussed above.

In many circumstances scattering causes radiation to redden because entropy results in the predominance of many low-energy photons over few high-energy ones (while conserving total energy). Except possibly under carefully controlled conditions, scattering does not produce the same relative change in wavelength across the whole spectrum; that is, any calculated is generally a function of wavelength. Furthermore, scattering from random media generally occurs at many angles, and is a function of the scattering angle. If multiple scattering occurs, or the scattering particles have relative motion, then there is generally distortion of spectral lines as well.

In interstellar astronomy, visible spectra can appear redder due to scattering processes in a phenomenon referred to as interstellar reddening—similarly Rayleigh scattering causes the atmospheric reddening of the Sun seen in the sunrise or sunset and causes the rest of the sky to have a blue color. This phenomenon is distinct from red&quot;shift&quot;ing because the spectroscopic lines are not shifted to other wavelengths in reddened objects and there is an additional dimming and distortion associated with the phenomenon due to photons being scattered in and out of the line of sight.

==Blueshift==

The opposite of a redshift is a blueshift. A blueshift is any decrease in wavelength (increase in energy), with a corresponding increase in frequency, of an electromagnetic wave. In visible light, this shifts a color towards the blue end of the spectrum.

=== Doppler blueshift ===

Doppler blueshift is caused by movement of a source towards the observer. The term applies to any decrease in wavelength and increase in frequency caused by relative motion, even outside the visible spectrum. Only objects moving at near-relativistic speeds toward the observer are noticeably bluer to the naked eye, but the wavelength of any reflected or emitted photon or other particle is shortened in the direction of travel.

Doppler blueshift is used in astronomy to determine relative motion:
* The Andromeda Galaxy is moving toward our own Milky Way galaxy within the Local Group; thus, when observed from Earth, its light is undergoing a blueshift.
* Components of a binary star system will be blueshifted when moving towards Earth
* When observing spiral galaxies, the side spinning toward us will have a slight blueshift &quot;relative to&quot; the side spinning away from us (see Tully–Fisher relation).
* Blazars are known to propel relativistic jets toward us, emitting synchrotron radiation and bremsstrahlung that appears blueshifted.
* Nearby stars such as Barnard&#x27;s Star are moving toward us, resulting in a very small blueshift.
* Doppler blueshift of distant objects with a high &quot;z&quot; can be subtracted from the much larger cosmological redshift to determine relative motion in the expanding universe.

=== Gravitational blueshift ===

Unlike the &quot;relative&quot; Doppler blueshift, caused by movement of a source towards the observer and thus dependent on the received angle of the photon, gravitational blueshift is &quot;absolute&quot; and does not depend on the received angle of the photon:
It is a natural consequence of conservation of energy and mass–energy equivalence, and was confirmed experimentally in 1959 with the Pound–Rebka experiment. Gravitational blueshift contributes to cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy via the Sachs–Wolfe effect: when a gravitational well evolves while a photon is passing, the amount of blueshift on approach will differ from the amount of gravitational redshift as it leaves the region.

==== Blue outliers ====
There are faraway active galaxies that show a blueshift in their [O III] emission lines. One of the largest blueshifts is found in the narrow-line quasar, PG 1543+489, which has a relative velocity of -1150 km/s. These types of galaxies are called &quot;blue outliers&quot;.

===Cosmological blueshift===
In a hypothetical universe undergoing a runaway Big Crunch contraction, a cosmological blueshift would be observed, with galaxies further away being increasingly blueshifted—the exact opposite of the actually observed cosmological redshift in the present expanding universe.

<text>Robert Reiner (born March 6, 1947) is an American film director, producer, screenwriter, and actor. As an actor, Reiner first came to national prominence with the role of Mike &quot;Meathead&quot; Stivic on the CBS sitcom &quot;All in the Family&quot; (1971–1979), a performance that earned him two Primetime Emmy Awards. His other acting credits include &quot;Throw Momma from the Train&quot; (1987), &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993), &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; (1994), &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; (1996), &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998), &quot;EDtv&quot; (1999), &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Hero&quot; (2006), and &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; (2013). 

Reiner made his directorial film debut with heavy metal mockumentary &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; (1984). He then earned acclaim directing the romantic comedy &quot;The Sure Thing&quot; (1985), coming of age drama &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1986), fantasy adventure &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987), romantic comedy &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; (1989), psychological horror-thriller &quot;Misery&quot; (1990), military courtroom drama &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (1992) which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, and romantic comedy-drama &quot;The American President&quot; (1995). He has earned nominations for four Golden Globe Awards for Best Director, and for three Directors Guild of America Awards.

== Early life ==
Reiner was born into a Jewish family in the Bronx, New York, on March 6, 1947. His parents were Estelle and Carl Reiner. As a child, Reiner lived at 48 Bonnie Meadow Road in New Rochelle, New York; the home of the fictional Petrie family in &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, created by Rob&#x27;s father, was 148 Bonnie Meadow Road. He studied at the UCLA Film School.

== Career ==

In the early 1960s Reiner served as a trainee/apprentice at the Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Pennsylvania. In the late 1960s, Reiner acted in bit roles in several television shows including &quot;Batman&quot;, &quot;That Girl&quot;, &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot;, &quot;Room 222&quot;, &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot;. During this time he also appeared in several films, including some by his father such as &quot;Where&#x27;s Poppa?&quot; (1970). He began his career writing for the &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; in 1968 and 1969, with Steve Martin as his writing partner as the two youngest writers on the show.

Two years later, Reiner became famous playing Michael Stivic, Archie Bunker&#x27;s liberal son-in-law, on Norman Lear&#x27;s 1970s situation comedy &quot;All in the Family&quot;, which was inspired by the British sitcom &quot;Till Death Us Do Part&quot;. It was the most-watched television program in the United States for five seasons (1971–1976). The character&#x27;s nickname &quot;Meathead&quot; (given to him by his cantankerous father-in-law Archie) became closely associated with him, even after he had left the role and went on to build a career as a director. Reiner has stated, &quot;I could win the Nobel Prize and they&#x27;d write &#x27;Meathead wins the Nobel Prize&#x27;.&quot; For his performance, Reiner won two Emmy Awards, in addition to three other nominations, and five Golden Globe nominations. After an extended absence, Reiner returned to television acting with a recurring role on &quot;New Girl&quot; (2012–2018).

In October 1971, he had a guest role in an episode of &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;. In 1972, Reiner, Phil Mishkin, and Gerry Isenberg created the situation comedy &quot;The Super&quot; for ABC. Starring Richard S. Castellano, the show depicted the life of the harried Italian American superintendent of a New York City apartment building and ran for 10 episodes in the summer of 1972. Reiner and Mishkin co-wrote the premiere episode.

Beginning in the 1980s, Reiner became known as a director of several successful Hollywood films that spanned many different genres. Some of his earlier films include cult classics such as the rock-band mockumentary &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; (1984) and the comedic fantasy film &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987), as well as his period piece coming of age tale &quot;Stand by Me&quot; (1986). He often collaborates with film editor Robert Leighton, whom he also shares with fellow director-actor Christopher Guest as their go-to editor.

Reiner has gone on to direct other critically and commercially successful films with his own company, Castle Rock Entertainment. These include the romantic comedy &quot;When Harry Met Sally...&quot; (1989), which has been critically ranked among the all-time best of its genre, the tense thriller &quot;Misery&quot; (1990), for which Kathy Bates won the Academy Award for Best Actress, and his most commercially successful work, the military courtroom drama &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; (1992), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Subsequent films directed by Reiner include the political romance &quot;The American President&quot; (1995), the courtroom drama &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot; (1996), and the uplifting comedy &quot;The Bucket List&quot; (2007).

Reiner has continued to act in supporting roles in a number of films and television shows, including &quot;Throw Momma from the Train&quot; (1987), &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993), &quot;Bullets Over Broadway&quot; (1994), &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; (1996), &quot;Primary Colors&quot; (1998), &quot;EDtv&quot; (1999), &quot;New Girl&quot; (2012–2018), and &quot;The Wolf of Wall Street&quot; (2013). He has also acted in several of his own films, most notably as faux-documentarian Marty DeBirgi in &quot;This is Spinal Tap&quot;. Other acting roles in his movies include &quot;The Story of Us&quot; (1999), &quot;Alex &amp; Emma&quot; (2001), and a major supporting role in his journalism drama &quot;Shock and Awe&quot; (2017), among others. Reiner has also parodied himself with cameos in works such as &quot;Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star&quot; (2003), and &quot;30 Rock&quot; (2010).

In December 2023 Reiner opened the primetime CBS special &quot;Dick Van Dyke: 98 Years of Magic&quot; with a tribute to, and conversation with, Dick Van Dyke.

== Political views ==
Reiner has devoted considerable time and energy to liberal activism.

Reiner is a co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which initiated the court challenge against California Proposition 8 that banned same-sex marriage in the state.

In 1998, Reiner chaired the campaign to pass Prop 10, the California Children and Families Initiative, which created First 5 California, a program of early childhood development services, funded by a tax on tobacco products. He served as the first chairman of First 5 California, from 1999 to 2006. His lobbying, particularly as an anti-smoking advocate, prompted his likeness to be used in a satirical role in a &quot;South Park&quot; episode titled &quot;Butt Out&quot;, in which he is depicted as a morbidly obese, hypocritical tyrant. Reiner came under criticism for campaigning for a ballot measure (Prop 82) to fund state-run preschools while still chair of the First Five Commission, causing him to resign from his position on March 29, 2006. An audit was conducted, and it concluded that the state commission did not violate state law and that it had clear legal authority to conduct its public advertising campaigns related to preschool. Prop 82 failed to win approval, garnering only 39.1% support.

Reiner is a member of the Social Responsibility Task Force, an organization advocating moderation where social issues (such as violence and tobacco use) and the entertainment industry meet. He is also active in environmental issues, and he successfully led the effort to establish California&#x27;s Ahmanson Ranch as a state park and wildlife refuge rather than as a commercial real estate development. He introduced Spinal Tap at the London Live Earth concert in July 2007.
Reiner was mentioned as a possible candidate to run against California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2006 but decided not to run for personal reasons. He campaigned extensively for Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election, and he campaigned in Iowa for Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean just before the 2004 Iowa caucuses. He endorsed Hillary Clinton for president for the 2008 election. In 2015, he donated $10,000 to Correct the Record, a political action committee that supported Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 2016 presidential campaign. Since the 2016 election, he has continued to campaign against Donald Trump, calling him racist, sexist, anti-gay, and anti-Semitic. Reiner said that Harvey Weinstein is a &quot;bad guy&quot; but Trump is &quot;also an abuser&quot;.

Reiner serves on the advisory board of the &quot;Committee to Investigate Russia&quot;. He and David Frum launched the site in September 2017 with Morgan Freeman warning people that &quot;We are at war&quot; and that Russia has attacked the United States. Others on the committee&#x27;s advisory board at the time of launch included James Clapper, Max Boot, Charles Sykes, and Norman Ornstein. Additionally, in early November 2020, the advisory board included Evelyn Farkas, Michael Hayden, Michael Morrell, Leon Panetta, and Clint Watts.

Reiner endorsed Joe Biden for president for the 2020 election.

In June 2021, Reiner said that he was working on a 10- to 13-episode TV project covering the relationship between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump. The project, he said, would cover the leaders&#x27; childhoods up until the point where their lives cross. Reiner said he is working with writer Ward Parry on the project, which he is calling &quot;The Spy and the Asset&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Rob Reiner married actress/director Penny Marshall in 1971. He adopted Marshall&#x27;s daughter, actress Tracy Reiner (&quot;A League of Their Own&quot;), from a previous marriage to Michael Henry. Reiner and Marshall divorced in 1981.

Reiner was introduced to his future wife, photographer Michele Singer, while directing &quot;When Harry Met Sally&quot;. The meeting not only resulted in his decision to change the ending of that film, but he also married Singer in 1989. They have three children, Jake (born 1991), Nick (born 1993), and Romy (born 1997). 

In 1997, Reiner and Singer founded the &quot;I Am Your Child Foundation&quot;, and in 2004, they founded the &quot;Parents&#x27; Action for Children&quot;, a non-profit organization with a dual purpose: 1) to raise awareness of the importance of a child&#x27;s early years by producing and distributing celebrity-hosted educational videos for parents, and 2) to advance public policy through parental education and advocacy.

Reiner has stated that his childhood home was not observantly Jewish, although he did have a bar mitzvah ceremony; Reiner&#x27;s father Carl acknowledged that he himself had become atheistic as the Holocaust progressed. Reiner identified himself as having no religious affiliation and as atheistic on the January 13, 2012, episode of &quot;Real Time with Bill Maher&quot;. Reiner later said that while he rejected organized religion, he was sympathetic to the ideas of Buddhism.

<doc id="26265" wikidata="Q272972" url="?curid=26265" title="Robin Wright">
<text>Robin Gayle Wright (born April 8, 1966) is an American actress. She has received accolades including a Golden Globe Award, and nominations for eight Primetime Emmy Awards.

Wright first gained attention for her role as Kelly Capwell in the NBC Daytime soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; from 1984 to 1988. She transitioned to film with a starring role in the fantasy film &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987), and gained a nomination for a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role in the top-grossing drama &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994). Wright had further starring roles in the romantic drama &quot;Message in a Bottle&quot; (1999) as well as the thriller &quot;Unbreakable&quot; (2000), and gained praise for her performances in the independent films &quot;Loved&quot; (1997), &quot;She&#x27;s So Lovely&quot; (1997), &quot;Nine Lives&quot; (2005) and &quot;Sorry, Haters&quot; (2006). She has since taken on supporting roles in the sports drama &quot;Moneyball&quot; (2011), the thriller &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot; (2011), the adventure film &quot;Everest&quot; (2015), the superhero film &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (2017), and the science fiction film &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; (2017).

On television, Wright starred in the HBO miniseries &quot;Empire Falls&quot; in 2005. From 2013 to 2018, she starred as Claire Underwood in the Netflix political drama series &quot;House of Cards&quot;. Her performance earned a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress and six nominations for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress. In 2016, Wright was named one of the highest-paid actresses in the United States, earning US$420,000 per episode for &quot;House of Cards&quot;. She has also directed ten episodes of the series as well as two episodes of the Netflix crime series &quot;Ozark&quot; in 2022.

==Early life==
Robin Wright was born in Dallas, Texas. She has an older brother, and her mother&#x27;s name is Gayle. Her parents divorced when she was two, which led to her relocating to San Diego, California, with her mother. She grew up in Southern California, attending La Jolla High School in La Jolla and William Howard Taft Charter High School in Los Angeles.

==Career==
Wright began her career as a model, when she was 14. At the age of 18, she played Kelly Capwell in the NBC Daytime soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;, for which she received several Daytime Emmy Award nominations.

===1980s–2000s: Transition into feature films===
Wright transitioned into feature film work with a role in &quot;Hollywood Vice Squad&quot; in 1986, followed by her breakthrough role as Princess Buttercup in the cult film &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; in 1987. She gained critical acclaim in her role as Jenny Curran in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; (1994), receiving Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild nominations for Best Supporting Actress.

In 1996, she starred in the lead role of the film adaptation of Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; (1996), for which she received a Satellite Award nomination for Best Actress in a Drama. She was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress for her role in &quot;She&#x27;s So Lovely&quot; (1997), a film in which she co-starred with her then-husband Sean Penn. Wright received her third Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for her role in the television film &quot;Empire Falls&quot; (2005).

===2013–2018: &quot;House of Cards&quot;===
From 2013 to 2018, Wright appeared in the Netflix political drama streaming television series &quot;House of Cards&quot; in the role of Claire Underwood, the ruthless wife of political mastermind Frank Underwood. On January 12, 2014, she won a Golden Globe for the role, becoming the first actress to win the award for a streaming television series. She was nominated for the same award in 2015. She received nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award in 2013 and 2014 for the same role.

Following Season 4 in 2016, Wright stated that she felt Claire Underwood was the equal of Frank Underwood and demanded equal pay for her performance as her co-star Kevin Spacey. Netflix acquiesced. In 2017, for her performance in the fifth season, Wright was nominated for her fifth consecutive Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. In 2014, 2016, and 2017, Wright received Best Actress in a Drama Series nominations for the Critics&#x27; Choice Television Awards, with her being the only nomination for the show in December 2017.

In October 2017, she was the show&#x27;s new lead for the final season, following the firing of Kevin Spacey due to sexual misconduct allegations. For her last appearance as Underwood, her performance was acclaimed - described as a &quot;commanding performance [that] is more than enough to keep [the final season] standing strong&quot; - earning her her final nominations for the role at the Screen Actors Guild and Primetime Emmy Awards in 2019. For the latter, she became one of seven women to be nominated for the category six or more times for the same show, the first in 10 years since Mariska Hargitay for &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;.

===Further film and directorial work===
In 2017, Wright directed a short film, &quot;The Dark of Night&quot;, which starred Sam Rockwell and premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. Wright played General Antiope in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; in 2017, and its 2020 sequel alongside Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. The film earned positive reviews and emerged as a financial success, grossing $822.8 million at the box office. She appears in the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; sequel &quot;Blade Runner 2049&quot; alongside Ryan Gosling, Harrison Ford, and Jared Leto, directed by Denis Villeneuve.

Her feature film directorial debut in the film &quot;Land&quot; was announced in April 2019. Wright starred as its lead, Edee Mathis, a lawyer who retreats in grief to the Shoshone National Forest in Wyoming. Sales for the film start at Cannes in May 2019. Filming began in October 2019 and the movie was picked up by distributor Focus Features.

&quot;Land&quot; premiered in January 2021 at the Sundance Film Festival to generally positive reviews, with specific praise towards the direction and the performances. Peter Debruge in a review for Variety wrote: &quot;So bless Wright for paring “Land” down to a beautiful haiku, and for delivering a performance that&#x27;s ambiguous and understated in all the right ways,&quot; and &quot;in a directorial debut so pure and simple it speaks to enormous self-confidence, has better instincts than to reveal outright.&quot;

In 2022, Wright directed the final two episodes of the first part of season 4 of the Netflix show, &quot;Ozark&quot;. The episodes were titled: &quot;Sangre Sobre Todo&quot; and &quot;Sanctified&quot;. Kayla Cobb for &quot;Decider&quot; praised Wright&#x27;s direction in the latter episode as &quot;powerful&quot; with the pairing of her direction, the script and actress Julia Garner&#x27;s performance as a &quot;masterful collaboration.&quot;

Wright will next star in and produce Ben Young&#x27;s thriller &quot;Where All Light Tends to Go&quot;, an adaptation of the book of the same name by David Joy. In April 2022, Wright joined the cast of Netflix&#x27;s fantasy film &quot;Damsel&quot; directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. Wright also starred in a Sony Pictures Classics and Miramax adaptation of Richard McGuire&#x27;s &quot;Here&quot; in a &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; reteam with director Robert Zemeckis, actor Tom Hanks and writer Eric Roth coming on November 1st, 2024.

==Personal life==

From 1986 to 1988, Wright was married to actor Dane Witherspoon, whom she met in 1984 on the set of the soap opera &quot;Santa Barbara&quot;.

In 1989, Wright became involved with actor Sean Penn following his divorce from Madonna. Wright was offered the role of Maid Marian in the film &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot;, but turned it down because she was pregnant. Their daughter, Dylan Penn, was born in April 1991. She backed out of the role of Abby McDeere in &quot;The Firm&quot; (1993) due to her pregnancy with her second child. Their son, Hopper Jack, was born in August 1993.

After breaking up and getting back together, Wright and Penn married in 1996. Their on-and-off relationship seemingly ended in divorce plans, announced in December 2007. The divorce petition was withdrawn four months later at the couple&#x27;s request. In February 2009, Wright and Penn attended the 81st Academy Awards together, at which Penn won the Best Actor award. Penn filed for legal separation in April 2009, but withdrew the petition in May. In August 2009, Wright filed for divorce, declaring she had no plans to reconcile. The divorce was finalized in July 2010.

In February 2012, Wright began dating actor Ben Foster. Their engagement was announced in January 2014. The couple called off their engagement in November 2014, but reunited in January 2015. In August 2015, they announced they were ending their second engagement.

In 2017, Wright began dating Clément Giraudet, a Saint Laurent executive. They secretly wed in August 2018 in La Roche-sur-le-Buis, France. Wright filed for divorce from Giraudet in September 2022.

==Philanthropy and activism==
Wright is the honorary spokesperson for the Dallas, Texas-based non-profit The Gordie Foundation.

In 2014, she co-partnered with two California-based companies: Pour Les Femmes and The SunnyLion. The SunnyLion donates a portion of its profits to the Raise Hope For Congo movement.

Wright is an activist for human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She is the narrator and executive producer of the documentary &quot;When Elephants Fight&quot; which highlights how multinational mining corporations and politicians in the Democratic Republic of Congo threaten human rights, and perpetuate conflict in the region.

She is a supporter of &quot;Stand with Congo&quot;, the human rights campaign behind the film. In 2016, Wright spoke publicly in support of the campaign at a film-screening at the Tribeca Film Institute in New York City, in media interviews, with journalists, and across her social media accounts.

<text>The rulers of Japan have been its Emperors, whether effectively or nominally, for its entire recorded history. These include the ancient legendary emperors, the attested but undated emperors of the Yamato period (early fifth to early 6th centuries), and the clearly dated emperors of 539 to the present. Political power was held in various eras by regents and &quot;shōguns&quot;, and since 1946 has been exercised exclusively by the Prime Minister as leader of a representative government.

<doc id="26272" wikidata="Q345494" url="?curid=26272" title="Ryuichi Sakamoto">
<text>was a Japanese composer, keyboardist, record producer and actor. He pursued a diverse range of styles as a solo artist and as a member of the synth-based band Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO). With his YMO bandmates Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, Sakamoto influenced and pioneered a number of electronic music genres.

Sakamoto began his career as a session musician, producer, and arranger while he was at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in the mid 1970s. His first major success came in 1978 as co-founder of YMO. He pursued a solo career at the same time, releasing the experimental electronic fusion album &quot;Thousand Knives&quot; in that year, and the album &quot;B-2 Unit&quot; in 1980. B-2 Unit included the track &quot;Riot in Lagos&quot;, which was a significant contribution to the development of electro and hip hop music. He went on to produce more solo records, and collaborate with many international artists; David Sylvian, DJ Spooky, Carsten Nicolai, Youssou N&#x27;Dour, and Fennesz among them. Sakamoto composed music for the opening ceremony of the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympic Games, and his composition &quot;Energy Flow&quot; (1999) was the first instrumental number-one single in Japan&#x27;s Oricon charts history.

As a film score composer, Sakamoto won an Academy Award (Oscar), a BAFTA, a Grammy, and two Golden Globe Awards. &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence&quot; (1983) marked his debut as both an actor and a film score composer; its main theme was adapted into the single &quot;Forbidden Colours&quot; which became an international hit. His most successful work as a film composer was &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Original Score, making him the first Japanese composer to win an Academy Award. He continued earning accolades composing for films such as &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; (1990), &quot;Little Buddha&quot; (1993), and &quot;The Revenant&quot; (2015). On occasion, Sakamoto also worked as a composer and a scenario writer on anime and video games. He was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the Ministry of Culture of France in 2009 for his contributions to music. Sakamoto died on March 28, 2023 from colorectal cancer at the age of 71.
==Early life==
Ryuichi Sakamoto was born on January 17, 1952, in Tokyo. His father, Kazuki Sakamoto, was a well-known literary editor, and his mother, Keiko (Shimomura) Sakamoto, designed women&#x27;s hats.
He began taking piano lessons at age 6, and started to compose at age 10. His early influences included Johann Sebastian Bach and Claude Debussy — whom he once called &quot;the door to all 20th century music.&quot; He also said, “Asian music heavily influenced Debussy, and Debussy heavily influenced me. So, the music goes around the world and comes full circle.&quot; He discovered jazz and rock and roll as a teenager, when he fell in with a crowd of hipster rebels. He was also influenced by jazz musicians such as John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman, and by rock bands such as The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. He described his political leanings during his time as a student as “not a 100 percent Marxist, but kind of”. At the height of the Japanese student protest movement, he and his classmates shut down their high school for several weeks.

==Career==
Sakamoto entered the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music in 1970, earning a B.A. in music composition in 1974 and a M.A. in 1976, with special emphasis on both electronic and ethnic music. He studied ethnomusicology there with the intention of becoming a researcher in the field, due to his interest in various world music traditions, particularly the Japanese, Okinawan, Indian, and African musical traditions. He was also trained in classical music and began experimenting with the electronic music equipment available at the university, including synthesizers such as the Buchla, Moog, and ARP.

===1970s===
In 1975, Sakamoto collaborated with percussionist Tsuchitori Toshiyuki to release &quot;Disappointment-Hateruma&quot;. After working as a session musician with Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi in 1977, the trio formed the internationally successful electronic music band Yellow Magic Orchestra (YMO) in 1978. Known for their seminal influence on electronic music, the group helped pioneer electronic genres such as electropop/technopop, synthpop, cyberpunk music, ambient house, and electronica. The group&#x27;s work has had a lasting influence across genres, ranging from hip hop and techno to acid house and general melodic music. Sakamoto was the songwriter and composer for a number of the band&#x27;s hit songs—including &quot;Yellow Magic (Tong Poo)&quot; (1978), &quot;Technopolis&quot; (1979), &quot;Nice Age&quot; (1980), &quot;Ongaku&quot; (1983), and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got to Help Yourself&quot; (1983)—while playing keyboards for many of their other songs, including international hits such as &quot;Computer Game/Firecracker&quot; (1978) and &quot;Rydeen&quot; (1979). He also sang on several songs, such as &quot;Kimi ni Mune Kyun&quot; (1983). Sakamoto&#x27;s composition &quot;Technopolis&quot; (1979) was credited as a contribution to the development of techno music, while the internationally successful &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; (1978)—a synthpop song in which he sang vocals through a vocoder—was later covered by a number of international artists, including Michael Jackson and Eric Clapton.

Sakamoto released his first solo album &quot;Thousand Knives of Ryūichi Sakamoto&quot; in mid-1978 with the help of Hideki Matsutake—Hosono also contributed to the song &quot;Thousand Knives&quot;. The album experimented with different styles, such as &quot;Thousand Knives&quot; and &quot;The End of Asia&quot;—in which electronic music was fused with traditional Japanese music—while &quot;Grasshoppers&quot; is a more minimalistic piano song. The album was recorded from April to July 1978 with a variety of electronic musical instruments, including various synthesizers, such as the KORG PS-3100, a polyphonic synthesizer; the Oberheim Eight Voice; the Moog III-C; the Polymoog, the Minimoog; the Micromoog; the Korg VC-10, which is a vocoder; the KORG SQ-10, which is an analog sequencer; the Syn-Drums, an electronic drum kit; and the microprocessor-based Roland MC-8 Microcomposer, which is a music sequencer that was programmed by Matsutake and played by Sakamoto. A version of the song &quot;Thousand Knives&quot; was released on the Yellow Magic Orchestra&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;BGM&quot;. This version was one of the earliest uses of the Roland TR-808 drum machine, for YMO&#x27;s live performance of &quot;1000 Knives&quot; in 1980 and their &quot;BGM&quot; album release in 1981.

===1980s===

In 1980, Sakamoto released the solo album &quot;B-2 Unit&quot;, which has been referred to as his &quot;edgiest&quot; record and is known for the electronic song &quot;Riot in Lagos&quot;, which is considered an early example of electro music (electro-funk), as Sakamoto anticipated the beats and sounds of electro. Early electro and hip hop artists, such as Afrika Bambaataa and Kurtis Mantronik, were influenced by the album—especially &quot;Riot in Lagos&quot;—with Mantronik citing the work as a major influence on his electro hip hop group Mantronix. &quot;Riot in Lagos&quot; was later included in Playgroup&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Kings of Electro&quot; (2007), alongside other significant electro compositions, such as Hashim&#x27;s &quot;Al-Naafyish&quot; (1983).

According to &quot;Dusted Magazine&quot;, Sakamoto&#x27;s use of squelching bounce sounds and mechanical beats was later incorporated in early electro and hip hop music productions, such as &quot;Message II (Survival)&quot; (1982), by Melle Mel and Duke Bootee; &quot;Magic&#x27;s Wand&quot; (1982), by Whodini and Thomas Dolby; Twilight 22&#x27;s &quot;Electric Kingdom&quot; (1983); and Kurt Mantronik&#x27;s &quot;The Album&quot; (1985). The 1980 release of &quot;Riot in Lagos&quot; was listed by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2011 as one of the 50 key events in the history of dance music. &quot;Resident Advisor&quot; said the track anticipated the sounds of techno and hip hop music, and that it inspired numerous artists from cities such as Tokyo, New York City and Detroit. Peter Tasker of &quot;Nikkei Asia&quot; said it was influential on techno, hip hop and house music.

One of the tracks on &quot;B-2 Unit&quot;, &quot;Differencia&quot; has, according to &quot;Fact&quot;, &quot;relentless tumbling beats and a stabbing bass synth that foreshadows jungle by nearly a decade&quot;. Some tracks on the album also foreshadow genres such as IDM, broken beat, and industrial techno, and the work of producers such as Actress and Oneohtrix Point Never. For several tracks on the album, Sakamoto worked with UK reggae producer Dennis Bovell, incorporating elements of afrobeat and dub music.

Also in 1980, Sakamoto released the single &quot;War Head/Lexington Queen&quot;, an experimental synthpop and electro record, and began a long-standing collaboration with David Sylvian, when he co-wrote and performed on the Japan track &quot;Taking Islands in Africa&quot;. In the following year, Sakamoto collaborated with Talking Heads and King Crimson guitarist Adrian Belew and Robin Scott for an album titled &quot;Left-Handed Dream&quot;. Following Japan&#x27;s dissolution, Sakamoto worked on another collaboration with Sylvian, a single entitled &quot;Bamboo Houses/Bamboo Music&quot; in 1982. Sakamoto&#x27;s 1980 collaboration with Kiyoshiro Imawano, &quot;Ikenai Rouge Magic&quot;, topped the Oricon singles chart.

In 1983, Sakamoto starred alongside David Bowie in director Nagisa Oshima&#x27;s &quot;Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence&quot;. In addition to acting in the film, Sakamoto also composed the film&#x27;s musical score and again collaborated with Sylvian on the film&#x27;s main theme (&quot;Forbidden Colours&quot;) – which became a minor hit. In a 2016 interview, Sakamoto reflected on his time acting in the film, claiming that he &quot;hung out&quot; with Bowie every evening for a month while filming on location. He remembered Bowie as &quot;straightforward&quot; and &quot;nice&quot;, while also lamenting the fact that he never mustered the courage to ask for Bowie&#x27;s help while scoring the film&#x27;s soundtrack as he believed Bowie was too &quot;concentrated on acting&quot;.

Sakamoto began work on his next album &quot;Ongaku Zukan&quot; in 1982, but it didn&#x27;t release until 1984. During production in 1983, he began using the newly released Yamaha DX7 the same year the digital synthesizer released. He initially used the DX7 for Mari Iijima&#x27;s debut city pop album &quot;Rosé&quot; in 1983 before using it for his solo album &quot;Ongaku Zukan&quot;, which eventually released in 1984.

Sakamoto broadened his musical range with a number of solo albums such &quot;Ongaku Zukan&quot; (1984), &quot;Neo Geo&quot; (1987), and &quot;Beauty&quot; (1989). These albums included collaborations with artists such as Thomas Dolby, Iggy Pop, Youssou N&#x27;Dour, and Brian Wilson.

In 1985, Sakamoto was commissioned to score a dance composition by New York choreographer Molissa Fenley called &quot;Esperanto&quot;. The performance itself debuted at the Joyce Theater, to mixed reviews from Anna Kisselgoff at &quot;The New York Times&quot; which said of Sakamoto&#x27;s music, that &quot;The sound often resembles a radio shut on and off.&quot;
The score was subsequently released in Japan by Midi, Inc., and includes contributions from Arto Lindsay and YAS-KAZ. Jen Monroe of The Baffler called &quot;Esperanto&quot;, &quot;one of his early forays into sample-based music, which manages to be unremittingly gorgeous, aggressive, angular, and lush.&quot;

===1990s===
&quot;Heartbeat&quot; (1991) and &quot;Sweet Revenge&quot; (1994) features Sakamoto&#x27;s collaborations with a global range of artists such as Roddy Frame, Dee Dee Brave, Marco Prince, Arto Lindsay, Youssou N&#x27;Dour, David Sylvian, and Ingrid Chavez.

In 1995 Sakamoto released &quot;Smoochy&quot;, described by the &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; website as Sakamoto&#x27;s &quot;excursion into the land of easy-listening and Latin&quot;, followed by the &quot;1996&quot; album, which featured a number of previously released pieces arranged for solo piano, violin, and cello. During December 1996 Sakamoto, composed the entirety of an hour-long orchestral work entitled &quot;Untitled 01&quot; and released as the album &quot;Discord&quot; (1998). The Sony Classical release of &quot;Discord&quot; was sold in a jewel case that was covered by a blue-colored slipcase made of foil, while the CD also contained a data video track. In 1998 the Ninja Tune record label released the &quot;Prayer/Salvation Remixes&quot;, for which prominent electronica artists such as Ashley Beedle and Andrea Parker remixed sections from the &quot;Prayer&quot; and &quot;Salvation&quot; parts of &quot;Discord&quot;. Sakamoto collaborated primarily with guitarist David Torn and DJ Spooky—artist Laurie Anderson provides spoken word on the composition—and the recording was condensed from nine live performances of the work, recorded during a Japanese tour. &quot;Discord&quot; was divided into four parts: &quot;Grief&quot;, &quot;Anger&quot;, &quot;Prayer&quot;, and &quot;Salvation&quot;; Sakamoto explained in 1998 that he was &quot;not religious, but maybe spiritual&quot; and &quot;The Prayer is to anybody or anything you want to name.&quot; Sakamoto further explained:

In 1998, Italian ethnomusicologist Massimo Milano published &quot;Ryuichi Sakamoto. Conversazioni&quot; through the Padova, Arcana imprint. All three editions of the book were published in the Italian language. Sakamoto&#x27;s next album, &quot;BTTB&quot; (1999)—an acronym for &quot;Back to the Basics&quot; is comprised a series of original pieces on solo piano influenced by Debussy and Satie and includes &quot;Energy Flow&quot; (a major hit in Japan) and an arrangement of the Yellow Magic Orchestra classic &quot;Tong Poo&quot;.

Sakamoto&#x27;s long-awaited &quot;opera&quot; &quot;&quot; was released in 1999, with visual direction by Shiro Takatani, artistic director of Dumb Type. This ambitious multi-genre multi-media project featured contributions from Pina Bausch, Bernardo Bertolucci, Josep Carreras, the Dalai Lama, and Salman Rushdie. In 2007, they &quot;deconstructed&quot; all the visual images and the sound, to create an art installation.

===2000s===
Sakamoto teamed with cellist Jaques Morelenbaum and singer Paula Morelenbaum, on a pair of albums celebrating the work of bossa nova pioneer Antonio Carlos Jobim. They recorded their first album, &quot;Casa&quot; (2001), mostly in Jobim&#x27;s home studio in Rio de Janeiro, with Sakamoto performing on the late Jobim&#x27;s grand piano. The album was well received, having been included in the list of &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s top albums of 2002. A live album, &quot;Live in Tokyo&quot;, and a second album, &quot;A Day in New York&quot;, soon followed. Sakamoto and the Morelenbaums would also collaborate on N.M.L. No More Landmine, an international effort to raise awareness for the removal of landmines. The trio would release the single &quot;Zero Landmine&quot;, which also featured David Sylvian, Brian Eno, Kraftwerk, Cyndi Lauper, and Haruomi Hosono and Yukihiro Takahashi, the other two founding members of Yellow Magic Orchestra.

Sakamoto collaborated with Alva Noto (an alias of Carsten Nicolai) to release &quot;Vrioon&quot;, an album of Sakamoto&#x27;s piano clusters treated by Nicolai&#x27;s unique style of digital manipulation, involving the creation of &quot;micro-loops&quot; and minimal percussion. The two produced this work by passing the pieces back and forth until both were satisfied with the result. This debut, released on German label Raster-Noton, was voted record of the year 2004 in the electronica category by British magazine &quot;The Wire&quot;. They then released &quot;Insen&quot; (2005)—while produced in a similar manner to Vrioon, this album is somewhat more restrained and minimalist. After further collaboration, they released two more albums: &quot;utp_&quot; (2008) and &quot;Summvs&quot; (2011).

In 2005, Finnish mobile phone manufacturer Nokia hired Sakamoto to compose ring and alert tones for their high-end phone, the Nokia 8800. In 2006, Nokia offered the ringtones for free on their website. Around this time, a reunion with YMO cofounders Hosono and Takahashi caused a stir in the Japanese press. They released a single &quot;Rescue&quot; in 2007 and a DVD &quot;HAS/YMO&quot; in 2008. In July 2009, Sakamoto was honored as Officier of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres at the French embassy in Tokyo.

===2010s–2023===
Throughout the latter part of the 2000s, Sakamoto collaborated on several projects with visual artist Shiro Takatani, including the installations &quot;LIFE – fluid, invisible, inaudible...&quot; (2007–2013), commissioned by YCAM, Yamaguchi, &quot;collapsed&quot; and &quot;silence spins&quot; at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo in 2012 and 2013 Sharjah Biennial (U.A.E.), &quot;LIFE-WELL&quot; in 2013, and a special version for Park Hyatt Tokyo&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2014, and he did music for the joint performance &quot;LIFE-WELL&quot; featuring the actor Noh/Kyogen Mansai Nomura, and for Shiro Takatani&#x27;s performance &quot;ST/LL&quot; in 2015.

In 2013, Sakamoto was a jury member at the 70th Venice International Film Festival. The jury viewed 20 films and was chaired by filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci.

On April 14, 2013, he also participated in a performance of film and music by video pioneer Nam June Paik, selected by musicians and composers who knew him well: himself, Stephen Vitiello, and Steina Vasulka.

In 2014, Sakamoto became the first guest artistic director of the Sapporo International Art Festival 2014 (SIAF2014). On July 10, Sakamoto released a statement indicating that he had been diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer in late June of the same year. He announced a break from his work while he sought treatment and recovery. On August 3, 2015, Sakamoto posted on his website that he was &quot;in great shape ... I am thinking about returning to work&quot; and announced that he would be providing music for Yoji Yamada&#x27;s &quot;Haha to Kuraseba&quot; (&quot;Living with My Mother&quot;). In 2015, Sakamoto also composed the score for the Alejandro González Iñárritu&#x27;s film, &quot;The Revenant&quot;, for which he received a Golden Globe nomination.

In January 2017 it was announced that Sakamoto would release a solo album in April 2017 through Milan Records; the new album, titled &quot;async&quot;, was released on March 29, 2017, to critical acclaim. In February 2018, he was selected to be on the jury for the main competition section of the 68th Berlin International Film Festival.

On June 14, 2018, a documentary about the life and work of Sakamoto, entitled &quot;Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda&quot;, was released. The film follows Sakamoto as he recovers from cancer and resumes creating music, protests nuclear power plants following the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Disaster, and creates field recordings in a variety of locales. He also elucidates the influence of Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky on the making of his then upcoming album async. Sakamoto says, &quot;When I started making the album, the sound that was in my mind was the Bach theme from &quot;Solaris&quot;, arranged on synthesizers by Eduard Artemyev. I arranged the same piece in the beginning of the process for &quot;async&quot;, and it sounded really good. It was very different from Artemyev&#x27;s version, so I was very happy. Then I arranged four more Bach chorales next to that, and they all sounded really good. So I thought, maybe this is the album? Then I thought I needed to do something more, to write my own chorale. I tried, and that became the song &quot;solari&quot;, obviously, with no &quot;s&quot;. He later said, &quot;As I&#x27;ve been making music and trying to go deeper and deeper, I was finally able to understand what the Tarkovsky movies are about – how symphonic they are – it&#x27;s almost music. Not just the sounds – it&#x27;s a symphony of moving images and sounds. They are more complex than music.&quot; He calls Tarkovsky and French director Robert Bresson his favorites, claiming their books – &quot;Notes on the Cinematographer&quot; and &quot;Sculpting in Time&quot;, respectively – as &quot;[his] bible.&quot;

Directed by Stephen Nomura Schible, the documentary was met with critical praise.

In 2021 he was associate artist of Holland Festival in Amsterdam where he presented the world premiere of &quot;TIME&quot;, his last collaboration with his long-term collaborator Shiro Takatani. This &quot;wordless opera&quot;, featuring dancer and actor Min Tanaka and shô player Mayumi Miyata was inspired by the first tale from Soseki Natsume&#x27;s collection of short stories &quot;Ten Nights of Dreams&quot;.

In 2022 he took part in the creation of Dumb Type&#x27;s new installation &quot;2022&quot; as a new member of the Japanese collective, for the Japan Pavilion at the 59th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia.

The same year Sakomoto collaborated with the young Ukrainian violinist Illia Bondarenko on the single &quot;Piece for Illia&quot; as part of the compilation fundraiser &quot;Ukraine (volume 2)&quot; for relief for victims of the Russian Invasion of Ukraine.

On April 24, 2023, the song &quot;Snooze&quot; was released by Agust D (Suga of BTS), in loving memory of Ryuichi Sakamoto, in which he is featured in the song as keyboards. He also appears in the music trailers leading up to the Agust D album, D-Day.

In 2023, filmmaker Neo Sora–Sakamoto&#x27;s son–directed a final performance of Sakomoto playing solo piano, released as &quot;Ryuichi Sakamoto: Opus&quot;. It premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2023.

==Production work==
Sakamoto&#x27;s production credits represent a prolific career in this role. In 1983, he produced Mari Iijima&#x27;s debut city pop album &quot;Rosé&quot;, the same year that the Yellow Magic Orchestra was disbanded. This was the first album where Sakamoto used a Yamaha DX7, the same year the digital synthesizer was released, before using it for his solo album &quot;Ongaku Zukan&quot; the following year. Sakamoto subsequently worked with artists such as Thomas Dolby; Aztec Camera, on the &quot;Dreamland&quot; (1993) album; and Imai Miki, co-producing her 1994 album &quot;A Place In The Sun&quot;. In 1996, Sakamoto produced &quot;Mind Circus&quot;, the first single from actress Miki Nakatani, leading to a collaboration period spanning 9 singles and 7 albums though 2001.

Roddy Frame, who worked with Sakamoto as a member of Aztec Camera, explained in a 1993 interview preceding the release of &quot;Dreamland&quot; that he had had to wait a lengthy period of time before he was able to work with Sakamoto, who wrote two soundtracks, a solo album and music for the opening ceremony at the Barcelona Olympics, prior to working with Frame over four weeks in a New York studio. Frame said that he was impressed by the work of YMO and the &quot;Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence&quot; soundtrack, explaining: &quot;That&#x27;s where you realise that the atmosphere around his compositions is actually in the writing – it&#x27;s got nothing to do with synthesisers.&quot; Frame&#x27;s decision to ask Sakamoto was finalized after he saw his performance at the Japan Festival that was held in London, United Kingdom. Of his experience recording with Sakamoto, Frame said:

In 1994, Japan Football Association asked Ryuichi Sakamoto to compose the instrumental song &quot;Japanese Soccer Anthem&quot;. The composition was played at the beginning of Japan Football Association-sponsored events.

==Film work==

Sakamoto began working in films, as a composer and actor, in Nagisa Oshima&#x27;s &quot;Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence&quot; (1983), for which he composed the score, title theme, and the duet &quot;Forbidden Colours&quot; with David Sylvian. Soon after, he was the subject of Elizabeth Lennard&#x27;s 1985 documentary &quot;Tokyo Melody&quot;, which mixes studio footage and interviews with Sakamoto about his musical philosophy in a nonlinear format, against a backdrop of 1980s Tokyo. Sakamoto later composed Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987), which earned him the Academy Award with fellow composers David Byrne and Cong Su. In that same year, he composed the score to the cult-classic anime film &quot;Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise&quot;. Sakamoto also went on to compose for the opening ceremony of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain.

Other films scored by Sakamoto include Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s &quot;High Heels&quot; (1991); Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;The Little Buddha&quot; (1993); Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Wild Palms&quot; (1993); John Maybury&#x27;s &quot;Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon&quot; (1998); Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Snake Eyes&quot; (1998) and &quot;Femme Fatale&quot; (2002); Oshima&#x27;s &quot;Gohatto&quot; (1999); Jun Ichikawa&#x27;s (director of the Mitsui ReHouse commercial from 1997 to 1999 starring Chizuru Ikewaki and Mao Inoue) &quot;Tony Takitani&quot; (2005);, Hwang Dong-hyuk&#x27;s, &quot;The Fortress&quot; (2017); and Andrew Levitas&#x27;s &quot;Minamata&quot; (2020) starring Johnny Depp, Minami, and Bill Nighy.

Several tracks from Sakamoto&#x27;s earlier solo albums have also appeared in film soundtracks. In particular, variations of &quot;Chinsagu No Hana&quot; (from &quot;Beauty&quot;) and &quot;Bibo No Aozora&quot; (from &quot;1996&quot;) provide the poignant closing pieces for Sue Brooks&#x27;s &quot;Japanese Story&quot; (2003) and Alejandro González Iñárritu&#x27;s &quot;Babel&quot; (2006), respectively. In 2015, Sakamoto teamed up with Iñárritu to score his film, &quot;The Revenant&quot;, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy. The film &quot;Monster&quot; by director Hirokazu Kore-eda, released in 2023, was Sakamoto&#x27;s final score; the film is dedicated to his memory.

Sakamoto also acted in several films: perhaps his most notable performance was as the conflicted Captain Yonoi in &quot;Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence&quot;, alongside Takeshi Kitano and British rock singer David Bowie. He also played roles in &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (as Masahiko Amakasu) and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Rain&quot; music video.

==Personal life==
In 1972, Sakamoto married Natsuko Sakamoto, with whom he had a daughter. The couple divorced in 1982, when Sakamoto married Japanese pianist and singer Akiko Yano, following several musical collaborations with her including touring work with the Yellow Magic Orchestra. Together, they had a daughter, the singer Miu Sakamoto. Sakamoto&#x27;s second marriage ended in August 2006, 14 years after a mutual decision to live separately. He then married his manager, Norika Sora, with whom he had one child, Neo Sora, an artist and filmmaker. Sakamoto lived primarily in New York City from 1990 until 2020, when he returned to Tokyo.

===Health and death===
Beginning in June 2014, Sakamoto took a year-long break after he was diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer. In 2015, he returned, saying, &quot;Right now I&#x27;m good. I feel better. Much, much better. I feel energy inside, but you never know. The cancer might come back in three years, five years, maybe 10 years. Also the radiation makes your immune system really low. It means I&#x27;m very susceptible to another cancer in my body.&quot;

On January 21, 2021, Sakamoto shared a letter on his website announcing that though his throat cancer had gone into remission, he had been diagnosed with rectal cancer, and was undergoing treatment after a successful surgery. He wrote, &quot;From now on, I will be living alongside cancer. But, I am hoping to make music for a little while longer.&quot;

Sakamoto died from cancer on March 28, 2023, at the age of 71. His death was announced on April 2, after his funeral had taken place.

==Activism==
Sakamoto was a member of the anti-nuclear organization Stop Rokkasho and demanded the closing of the Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant. In 2012, he organized the No Nukes 2012 concert, which featured performances by 18 groups, including Yellow Magic Orchestra and Kraftwerk. Sakamoto was also known as a critic of copyright law, arguing in 2009 that it is antiquated in the Information Age. He argued that in &quot;the last 100 years, only a few organizations have dominated the music world and ripped off both fans and creators&quot; and that &quot;with the internet we are going back to having tribal attitudes towards music.&quot;

In 2015, Sakamoto also supported opposition to the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in the Ōmura Bay in Henoko, with a new and Okinawan version of his 2004 single &quot;Undercooled&quot; whose sales partially contributed to the &quot;Henoko Fund&quot;, aimed to stop the relocation of the base on Okinawa.

Sakamoto was also an environmentalist. In one of his last public activities before his death, he sent a letter to Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike in early March 2023 calling for the suspension and review of the planned redevelopment of the Jingūmae neighborhood in Tokyo due to environmental concerns.

In 2006, Sakamoto, in collaboration with Japanese music company Avex Group, founded , a record label seeking to change the manner in which music is produced. Sakamoto explained that &#x27; was not his label but is a platform for all aspiring artists to join as equal collaborators to share the benefits of the music industry. On the initiative&#x27;s &quot;About&quot; page, the label is described as a project that &quot;aims to find new possibilities for music, while making meaningful contribution to culture and society&quot;. The name &quot;&#x27;&quot; is spelt with three &quot;m&quot;s because the third &quot;m&quot; stands for music.

==Awards and nominations==
Sakamoto won a number of awards for his work as a film composer, beginning with the BAFTA Award for Best Film Music for his score for &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence,&quot; in 1984. His greatest award success was for scoring &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987), which won him the Academy Award for Best Original Score, Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score, and Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, as well as a BAFTA nomination in 1989.

His score for &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot; (1990) won him his second Golden Globe Award, and his score for &quot;Little Buddha&quot; (1993) received another Grammy Award nomination. In 1997, his collaboration with Toshio Iwai, &quot;Music Plays Images X Images Play Music&quot;, was awarded the Golden Nica, the grand prize of the Prix Ars Electronica competition. He also contributed to the Academy Award winning soundtrack for &quot;Babel&quot; (2006) with several pieces of music, including the closing theme &quot;Bibo no Aozora&quot;. In 2009, he was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from France&#x27;s Ministry of Culture for his musical contributions. His score for &quot;The Revenant&quot; (2015) was nominated for the Golden Globe and BAFTA, and won Best Musical Score from the Dallas–Fort Worth Film Critics Association.

Sakamoto won the Golden Pine Award (Lifetime Achievement) at the 2013 International Samobor Film Music Festival, along with Clint Eastwood and Gerald Fried.

<text>Roger the Dodger is a comic strip character from the comic magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;. He first appeared in his eponymous comic strip in 1953, and is one of the longest-running characters, characterised by his tactics for avoiding responsibility and his parents&#x27; rules, or simply making chores easier, usually with the help of instructional &quot;dodge&quot; books.

== Character background ==
Ken Reid was recommended to DC Thomson by his brother-in-law Bill Holroyd, who illustrated for &quot;The Beano&quot;. Reid travelled to Dundee and was first tasked to design comic strip panels for a new character: a boy who did anything to evade responsibilities and favours.

After the design was approved, a three-panel advertisement printed in issue 560, showing Roger failing to sneak out the house before his father noticing, finding out instantly that his father had set up a tripwire. The caption revealed this was a teaser to a new comic strip called &quot;Roger the Dodger&quot;, boasting, &quot;You really think his dad has really caught him dodging his homework, don&#x27;t you? JUST YOU WAIT! ROGER ISN&#x27;T FINISHED YET!&quot;

==Characteristics==
Unlike most Beano characters, Roger does not intentionally cause chaos and mayhem, despite his attempts at dodging responsibilities and punishments often creating it. Ken Reid&#x27;s early stories frequently had Roger get caught by his family members, that do not hesitate with the cruelty of their vengeance. Reid&#x27;s final panels would show Roger being forced to do his chore (or clean up after his antics create more damage than intended) as a family member (usually his father) supervises with a smirk.

Roger has dark hair with a shaggy tuft at the front. He wears a red-and-black chequered jumper over his white, collared shirt. Initially he wore a tie, but this was discontinued in the 21st century, as well as the black shorts he also wore, that were changed to black trousers in the 1970s.

==Publication history==
He first appeared in issue 561, dated 18 April 1953. His appearance is vaguely similar to that of Dennis the Menace from the same magazine: he wears a black-and-red chequered jumper and black trousers, but takes better care of his hair than his equally mischievous counterpart. He also used to have a white tie, but it seems to have disappeared. Originally drawn by Ken Reid, Gordon Bell took over in 1959, but Roger dodged his way out of the Beano in 1960. He returned, drawn by Bob McGrath, in April 1961. Ken Reid was re-commissioned to draw the strip in 1962, and Robert Nixon when Reid left D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. in 1964. When Nixon left in 1973, Tom Lavery began drawing the strip, who was then followed by Frank McDiarmid in 1976.

Ten years later, after Euan Kerr took over as Beano editor, Nixon returned, drawing in a noticeably different style from the one before. Roger&#x27;s strip was given a second page in 1986. Between 1986 and 1992, a spin-off strip appeared at the end called &quot;Roger the Dodger&#x27;s Dodge Clinic&quot;. Readers would write in with problems, and Roger would try to find a dodge for it (which would usually go wrong). Winning suggestions would win a transistor radio and special scroll. Roger is often shown in other Beano characters&#x27; stories offering &quot;help&quot;, which he took to a new level in Beano issue 2648 from April 1993. This issue marked Roger&#x27;s 40th birthday, and to celebrate he made appearances in every strip in the comic.

Nixon continued drawing it until his death in October 2002, though due to the strips being drawn months in advance, his strips continued appearing in the Beano until the end of January 2003, when artist Barrie Appleby took over. He drew the strip until 2011, when he stopped to concentrate on Dennis and Gnasher, though Trevor Metcalfe drew a few strips in 2003 and 2004, and there have also been some Robert Nixon reprints during 2005 and 2006. Since Appleby stopped drawing Roger, the comic has run reprints of Robert Nixon strips from the 1980s. Along with the Nixon reprints, Roger&#x27;s Dodge Diary was introduced on the second half of Roger&#x27;s pages, where Beano readers can send in their own dodges. In each one, Roger says a good thing, a bad thing and the results of the dodge. When the Beano was revamped on 8 August 2012, Appleby started drawing Roger again and Roger&#x27;s parents were made younger. In the 75th birthday issue released on 24 July 2013, Jamie Smart took over as artist. On 9 April 2014, Wayne Thompson replaced Jamie Smart as Roger&#x27;s artist, until Barrie Appleby returned to draw the strip temporarily, before Wayne Thompson surprisingly returned. In 2017, writing duties for the strip were taken over by Danny Pearson.

Roger is currently the second-longest-running character in the Beano, behind only Dennis the Menace. However, if taken into account the strip&#x27;s absence in 1960 then he would be the third-longest-running behind Minnie the Minx.

==Other characters in the strip==
*Willow and Bill Dawson, Roger’s parents. In one strip in the Beano Book from 1957, his dad is referred to as Bill. He has occasionally been shown to have been a dodger in his youth and on occasion asks Roger for dodging help. In later years, his parents were renamed Les and Ada.
*His rival is a bully named Cruncher Kerr (believed to be named after Euan Kerr, though his earliest appearances predate Kerr&#x27;s appointment as Beano Editor in 1994).
*Roger has had two different pets, a Crow called Joe the Crow and a Cat called Dodge Cat.
*Roger also had two friends, Crafty Colin and Sneaky Pete. These two mainly appeared in the 1990s, though Pete did reappear in the 2006 Beano Annual. However, in the late 2000s, Roger gained a new friend called Dave.

* Roger appeared in the Beanoland section at Chessington World of Adventures with his own ride, Roger the Dodger&#x27;s Dodgems.

===Video games===

* Roger appeared in the PC racing game &quot;Beanotown Racing&quot; as a playable character. His vehicle was a checkered bumper car.
* Roger also featured as a character in The &quot;Beano&quot; Interactive DVD which consisted of mini-games and a few short animations.

<doc id="26275" wikidata="Q205927" url="?curid=26275" title="Robert Nozick">
<text>Robert Nozick (; November 16, 1938 – January 23, 2002) was an American philosopher. He held the Joseph Pellegrino University Professorship at Harvard University, and was president of the American Philosophical Association. He is best known for his book &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; (1974), a libertarian answer to John Rawls&#x27; &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; (1971), in which Nozick proposes his minimal state as the only justifiable form of government. His later work &quot;Philosophical Explanations&quot; (1981) advanced notable epistemological claims, namely his counterfactual theory of knowledge. It won Phi Beta Kappa society&#x27;s Ralph Waldo Emerson Award the following year.

Nozick&#x27;s other work involved ethics, decision theory, philosophy of mind, metaphysics and epistemology. His final work before his death, &quot;Invariances&quot; (2001), introduced his theory of evolutionary cosmology, by which he argues invariances, and hence objectivity itself, emerged through evolution across possible worlds.

==Personal life==
Nozick was born in Brooklyn to a family of Jewish descent. His mother was born Sophie Cohen, and his father was a Jew from a Russian shtetl who had been born with the name Cohen and who ran a small business.

Nozick attended the public schools in Brooklyn. He was then educated at Columbia University (A.B. 1959, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;), where he studied with Sidney Morgenbesser; Princeton University (PhD 1963) under Carl Hempel; and at Oxford University as a Fulbright Scholar (1963–1964).

At one point, Nozick joined the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League, and at Columbia University he founded the local chapter of the Student League for Industrial Democracy. He began to move away from socialist ideals when exposed to Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s &quot;The Constitution of Liberty&quot;, claiming he &quot;was pulled into libertarianism reluctantly&quot; when he found himself unable to form satisfactory responses to libertarian arguments. Nozick was initiated into the Alpha-Tau chapter of the Kappa Sigma Fraternity while at Columbia in 1956.

After receiving his undergraduate degree in 1959, he married Barbara Fierer. They had two children, Emily and David. The Nozicks eventually divorced; Nozick later married the poet Gjertrud Schnackenberg.

Nozick died in 2002 after a prolonged struggle with stomach cancer. He was interred at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Career and works==
===Political philosophy===
Nozick&#x27;s first book, &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; (1974), argues that only a minimal state limited to the functions of protection against &quot;force, fraud, theft, and administering courts of law&quot; can be justified, as any more extensive state would violate people&#x27;s individual rights.

Nozick believed that a distribution of goods is just when brought about by free exchange among consenting adults, trading from a baseline position where the principles of entitlement theory are upheld. In one example, Nozick uses the example of basketball player Wilt Chamberlain to show that even when large inequalities subsequently emerge from the processes of free transfer (i.e. paying extra money just to watch Wilt Chamberlain play), the resulting distributions are just so long as all consenting parties have freely consented to such exchanges.

&quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; is often contrasted to John Rawls&#x27;s &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; in popular academic discourse, as it challenged the partial conclusion of Rawls&#x27;s difference principle, that &quot;social and economic inequalities are to be arranged so that they are to be of greatest benefit to the least-advantaged members of society&quot;.

Nozick&#x27;s philosophy also claims to heritage from John Locke&#x27;s &quot;Second Treatise on Government&quot; and seeks to ground Locke&#x27;s state of nature, but breaks distinctly with Locke on the question of self-ownership by attempting to secularize his doctrine of natural law without accepting it. Instead, Nozick appealed to the second formulation of Immanuel Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative: that people should be treated as an end in themselves, not merely as a means to an end. Nozick terms this the &#x27;separateness of persons&#x27;, saying that &quot;there is no social entity...there are only individual people&quot;, and that we ought to &quot;respect and take account of the fact that [each individual] is a separate person&quot;.

Most controversially, Nozick argued that consistent application of libertarian self-ownership would allow for consensual, non-coercive enslavement contracts between adults. He rejected the notion of inalienable rights advanced by Locke and most contemporary capitalist-oriented libertarian academics, writing in &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; that the typical notion of a &quot;free system&quot; would allow individuals to voluntarily enter into non-coercive slave contracts.

&quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot; received a National Book Award in the category of Philosophy and Religion in the year following its original publication.

===Thought experiments regarding utilitarianism===

Early sections of &quot;Anarchy, State, and Utopia&quot;, akin to the introduction of &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;, see Nozick implicitly join Rawls&#x27;s attempts to discredit utilitarianism. Nozick&#x27;s case differs somewhat in that it mainly targets hedonism and relies on a variety of thought experiments, although both works draw from Kantian principles.

Most famously, Nozick introduced the experience machine in an attempt to show that ethical hedonism is not truly what individuals desire, nor what we ought to desire:

Nozick claims that life in an experience machine would have no value, and provides several explanations as to why this might be, including (but not limited to): the want to do certain things, and not just have the experience of doing them; the want to actually become a certain sort of person; and that plugging into an experience machine limits us to a man-made reality.

Another thought experiment Nozick proposes is the utility monster, designed to show that average utilitarianism could lead to a situation where the needs of the vast majority were sacrificed for one individual. In his exploration of deontological ethics and animal rights, Nozick coins the phrase &quot;utilitarianism for animals, Kantianism for people&quot;, wherein the separateness of individual humans is acknowledged but the only moral metric assigned to animals is that of maximising pleasure:

Before introducing the utility monster, Nozick raises a hypothetical scenario where someone might, &quot;by some strange causal connection&quot;, kill 10,000 unowned cows painlessly by snapping their fingers, asking whether it would be morally wrong to do so. On the calculus of pleasure that &quot;utilitarianism for animals, Kantianism for people&quot; uses, assuming the death of these cows could be used to provide pleasure for humans in some way, then the (painless) deaths of the cows would be morally permissible as it has no negative impact upon the utilitarian equation. 
Nozick later explicitly raises the example of utility monsters to &quot;embarrass [utilitarian theory]&quot;: since humans benefit from the mass sacrifice and consumption of animals, and also possess the ability to kill them painlessly (i.e., without any negative effect on the utilitarian calculation of net pleasure), it is permissible humans to maximise their consumption of meat so long as they derive pleasure from it. Nozick takes issue with this as it makes animals &quot;too subordinate&quot; to humans, counter to his view that animals ought to &quot;count for something&quot;.

===Epistemology===
In &quot;Philosophical Explanations&quot; (1981), Nozick provided novel accounts of knowledge, free will, personal identity, the nature of value, and the meaning of life. He also put forward an epistemological system which attempted to deal with both the Gettier problem and those posed by skepticism. This highly influential argument eschewed justification as a necessary requirement for knowledge.

Nozick gives four conditions for S&#x27;s knowing that P (S=Subject / P=Proposition):

# P is true
# S believes that P
# If it were the case that (not-P), S would not believe that P
# If it were the case that P, S would believe that P

Nozick&#x27;s third and fourth conditions are counterfactuals. He called this the &quot;tracking theory&quot; of knowledge. Nozick believed the counterfactual conditionals bring out an important aspect of our intuitive grasp of knowledge: For any given fact, the believer&#x27;s method (M) must reliably track the truth despite varying relevant conditions. In this way, Nozick&#x27;s theory is similar to reliabilism. Due to certain counterexamples that could otherwise be raised against these counterfactual conditions, Nozick specified that:

A major feature of Nozick&#x27;s theory of knowledge is his rejection of the principle of deductive closure. This principle states that if S knows X and S knows that X implies Y, then S knows Y. Nozick&#x27;s truth tracking conditions do not allow for the principle of deductive closure.

===Later works===

&quot;The Examined Life&quot; (1989), aimed towards a more general audience, explores themes of love, the impact of death, questions of faith, the nature of reality, and the meaning of life. The book takes its name from the quote by Socrates, that &quot;the unexamined life is not worth living&quot;. In it, Nozick attempts to find meaning in everyday experiences, and considers how we might come to feel &quot;more real&quot;. In this pursuit, Nozick discusses the death of his father, reappraises the experience machine, and proposes &quot;the matrix of reality&quot; as a means of understanding how individuals might better connect with reality in their own lives.

&quot;The Nature of Rationality&quot; (1993) presents a theory of practical reason that attempts to embellish classical decision theory. In this work, Nozick grapples with Newcomb&#x27;s problem and the Prisoner&#x27;s Dilemma, and introduces the concept of symbolic utility to explain how actions might symbolize certain ideas, rather than being carried out to maximize expected utility in the future.

&quot;Socratic Puzzles&quot; (1997) is a collection of Nozick&#x27;s previous papers alongside some new essays. While the discussions are quite disparate, the essays generally draw from Nozick&#x27;s previous interests in both politics and philosophy. Notably, this includes Nozick&#x27;s 1983 review of &quot;The Case for Animal Rights&quot; by Tom Regan, where says animal rights activists are often considered &quot;cranks&quot; and appears to go back on the vegetarian position he previously maintained in &quot;Anarchy, State and Utopia&quot;.

Nozick&#x27;s final work, &quot;Invariances&quot; (2001), applies insights from physics and biology to questions of objectivity in such areas as the nature of necessity and moral value. Nozick introduces his theory of truth, in which he leans towards a deflationary theory of truth, but argues that objectivity arises through being invariant under various transformations. For example, space-time is a significant objective fact because an interval involving both temporal and spatial separation is invariant, whereas no simpler interval involving only temporal or only spatial separation is invariant under Lorentz transformations. Nozick argues that invariances, and hence objectivity itself, emerged through a theory of evolutionary cosmology across possible worlds.

===Later reflections on libertarianism===

Nozick pronounced some misgivings about libertarianism – specifically his own work &quot;Anarchy, State and Utopia&quot; – in his later publications. Some later editions of &quot;The Examined Life&quot; advertise this fact explicitly in the blurb, saying Nozick &quot;refutes his earlier claims of libertarianism&quot; in one of the book&#x27;s essays, &quot;The Zigzag of Politics&quot;. In the introduction of &quot;The Examined Life&quot;, Nozick says his earlier works on political philosophy &quot;now [seem] seriously inadequate&quot;, and later repeats this claim in the first chapter of &quot;The Nature of Rationality&quot;.

In these works, Nozick also praised political ideals which ran contrary to the arguments canvassed in &quot;Anarchy, State and Utopia&quot;. In &quot;The Examined Life&quot;, Nozick proposes wealth redistribution via an inheritance tax and upholds the value of liberal democracy. In &quot;The Nature of Rationality&quot;, Nozick calls truth a primary good, explicitly appropriating Rawls&#x27; &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot;. In the same work, however, Nozick implies that minimum wage laws are unjust, and later denigrates Marxism before vindicating capitalism, making reference to Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;.

Nozick also broke away from libertarian principles in his own personal life, invoking rent control laws against Erich Segal – who was at one point Nozick&#x27;s landlord – and winning over $30,000 in a settlement. Nozick later claimed to regret doing this, saying he was moved by &quot;intense irritation&quot; with Segal and his legal representatives at the time, and was quoted in an interview saying &quot;sometimes you have to do what you have to do&quot;.

Some of Nozick&#x27;s later works seem to endorse libertarian principles. In &quot;Invariances&quot;, Nozick advances the &quot;four layers of ethics&quot;, which at its core maintains an explicitly libertarian underpinning. In &quot;Socratic Puzzles&quot;, Nozick republished some of his old essays with a libertarian grounding, such as &quot;Coercion&quot; and &quot;On The Randian Argument&quot;, alongside new essays such as &quot;On Austrian Methodology&quot; and &quot;Why Do Intellectuals Oppose Capitalism?&quot;. However, Nozick does allude to some continued reservations about libertarianism in its introduction, saying that &quot;it is disconcerting to be known primarily for an early work&quot;.

Scholars and journalists have since debated what Nozick&#x27;s true political position was before the end of his life. Writing for Slate, Stephen Metcalf notes one of Nozick&#x27;s core claims in &quot;The Examined Life&quot;, that actions done through government serve as markers of &quot;our human solidarity&quot;. Metcalf then postulates that Nozick felt this was threatened by neoliberal politics. Libertarian journalist Julian Sanchez, who interviewed Nozick shortly before his death, claims that Nozick &quot;always thought of himself as a libertarian in a broad sense, right up to his final days, even as his views became somewhat less &#x27;hardcore&#x27;&quot;.

===Philosophical method===
Nozick was sometimes admired for the exploratory style of his philosophizing, often content to raise tantalizing philosophical possibilities and then leave judgment to the reader. In his review of &quot;The Nature of Rationality&quot;, Anthony Gottlieb praised this style, noting its place in Nozick&#x27;s approach to writing philosophy:

Jason Brennan has related this point to Nozick&#x27;s &quot;surprising amount of humility, at least in his writings&quot;. Brennan makes a point of showing how this enabled Nozick to reach surprising conclusions while also drawing attention to one of Nozick&#x27;s more famous quotes which also made the headline of his obituary in &quot;The Economist&quot;, that &quot;there is room for words on subjects other than last words&quot;.

Nozick was also notable for drawing from literature outside of philosophy, namely economics, physics, evolutionary biology, decision theory, anthropology, and computer science, amongst other disciplines.

==Notes==
:a.Nozick&#x27;s discussion of animal rights pre-dates Peter Singer&#x27;s more comprehensive &quot;Animal Liberation&quot;. Singer&#x27;s utilitarian position on animal rights was known to Nozick at the time, however, and he expresses misgivings about this in Chapter 3 (footnote 11) of &quot;Anarchy, State and Utopia&quot;.
:b.From p.27 of &quot;The Nature of Rationality&quot;: &quot;On these grounds, one might claim that certain antidrug enforcement measures &quot;symbolize&quot; reducing the amount of drug use and that minimum wage laws &quot;symbolize&quot; helping the poor&quot;

<text>Redirect examination, in the United States, is the questioning of a witness who has already provided testimony under oath in response to direct examination as well as cross examination by the opponent. On redirect, the attorney offering the witness will ask additional questions that attempt to rehabilitate the witness&#x27;s credibility, or otherwise mitigate deficiencies identified and explored by the opponent on cross. For example, the opponent might elicit on cross-examination an admission that the witness did not directly perceive every single part of the events at issue; the proponent will attempt on redirect to establish that the witness perceived enough of those events that the finder of fact can draw reasonable inferences as to the gaps where the witness&#x27;s perception was obstructed.

&quot;Recross&quot; is sometimes allowed, but usually the opposing attorney must ask for permission from the judge before proceeding with that additional round of questioning.

In Australia, Canada, India, UK and South Africa the process is called re-examination.

<doc id="26278" wikidata="Q7341323" url="?curid=26278" title="Robert Abbot (theologian)">
<text>Robert Abbot () was an English theologian who promoted puritan doctrines. With a living at Cranbrook, Kent, he wrote anti-Catholic works and cultivated a local circle among the Kent gentry.

==Biography==
Robert Abbot received his education at Cambridge University, and later at
Oxford University. The details of Abbot&#x27;s ecclesiastical career are somewhat unclear, and can only be pieced together from fragmentary evidence, but based on something he wrote in his work &quot;Bee Thankfull London and her Sisters&quot;, it is probable that he began his church service with a posting as &quot;assistant to a reverend divine&quot;. A note in the margin indicates that the priest in question was &quot;Master Haiward of Wool Church&quot;, in Dorset. In 1616 he was appointed by George Abbot to the vicarage of Cranbrook in Kent. His ministry at Cranbrook was regarded as successful, but he was noted for his lack of tolerance towards nonconformists. In 1643, Abbot left Cranbrook, becoming vicar of Southwick, Hampshire. Later, he became pastor at the &quot;extruded&quot; Udall of St Austin&#x27;s, in London, where he apparently still served in 1657. Between 1657 and 1658, and in 1662, Abbot appears to vanish from record, and his activities are unknown.

==Written works==
Robert Abbot&#x27;s books are conspicuous amongst the works of his time by their terseness and variety. In addition to those mentioned above he wrote &quot;Triall of our Church-Forsakers&quot; (1639), &quot;Milk for Babes, or a Mother&#x27;s Catechism for her Children&quot; (1646), and &quot;A Christian Family builded by God, or Directions for Governors of Families&quot; (1653).

==Identification of father==
Abbot is sometimes mistakenly described as the son of the Archbishop of Canterbury of the same surname, George Abbot. The misunderstanding may stem from a passage in Robert Abbot&#x27;s work &quot;A Hand of Fellowship to Helpe Keepe out Sinne and Antichrist&quot;, in which he thanks the Archbishop for &quot;worldly maintenance,&quot; &quot;best earthly countenance&quot; and &quot;fatherly incouragements.&quot;

<text>Richard III (2 October 1452 – 22 August 1485) was King of England from 26 June 1483 until his death in 1485. He was the last king of the Plantagenet dynasty and its cadet branch the House of York. His defeat and death at the Battle of Bosworth Field marked the end of the Middle Ages in England.

Richard was created Duke of Gloucester in 1461 after the accession to the throne of his older brother Edward IV. This was during the period known as the Wars of the Roses, an era when two branches of the royal family contested the throne; Edward and Richard were Yorkists, and their side of the family faced-off against their Lancastrian cousins. In 1472, Richard married Anne Neville, daughter of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and widow of Edward of Westminster, son of Henry VI. He governed northern England during Edward&#x27;s reign, and played a role in the invasion of Scotland in 1482. When Edward IV died in April 1483, Richard was named Lord Protector of the realm for Edward&#x27;s eldest son and successor, the 12-year-old Edward V. Before arrangements were complete for Edward V&#x27;s coronation, scheduled for 22 June 1483, the marriage of his parents was declared bigamous and therefore invalid. Now officially illegitimate, Edward and his siblings were barred from inheriting the throne. On 25 June, an assembly of lords and commoners endorsed a declaration to this effect, and proclaimed Richard as the rightful king. He was crowned on 6 July 1483. Edward and his younger brother Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York, called the &quot;Princes in the Tower&quot;, disappeared from the Tower of London around August 1483.

There were two major rebellions against Richard during his reign. In October 1483, an unsuccessful revolt was led by staunch allies of Edward IV and Richard&#x27;s former ally, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham. Then, in August 1485, Henry Tudor and his uncle, Jasper Tudor, landed in Wales with a contingent of French troops, and marched through Pembrokeshire, recruiting soldiers. Henry&#x27;s forces defeated Richard&#x27;s army near the Leicestershire town of Market Bosworth. Richard was slain, making him the last English king to die in battle. Henry Tudor then ascended the throne as Henry VII.

Richard&#x27;s corpse was taken to the nearby town of Leicester and buried without ceremony. His original tomb monument is believed to have been removed during the English Reformation, and his remains were wrongly thought to have been thrown into the River Soar. In 2012, an archaeological excavation was commissioned by Philippa Langley with the assistance of the Richard III Society on the site previously occupied by Grey Friars Priory. The University of Leicester identified the human skeleton found at the site as that of Richard III as a result of radiocarbon dating, comparison with contemporary reports of his appearance, identification of trauma sustained at Bosworth and comparison of his mitochondrial DNA with that of two matrilineal descendants of his sister Anne. He was reburied in Leicester Cathedral in 2015.

==Early life==
Richard was born on 2 October 1452, at Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire, the eleventh of the twelve children of Richard, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville, and the youngest to survive infancy. His childhood coincided with the beginning of what has traditionally been labelled the &#x27;Wars of the Roses&#x27;, a period of political instability and periodic open civil war in England during the second half of the fifteenth century, between the Yorkists, who supported Richard&#x27;s father (a potential claimant to the throne of King Henry VI from birth), and opposed the regime of Henry VI and his wife, Margaret of Anjou, and the Lancastrians, who were loyal to the crown. In 1459, his father and the Yorkists were forced to flee England, whereupon Richard and his older brother George were placed in the custody of their aunt Anne Neville, Duchess of Buckingham, and possibly of Cardinal Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury.

When their father and elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, Richard and George were sent by their mother to the Low Countries. They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton. They participated in the coronation of their eldest brother as King Edward IV on 28 June 1461, when Richard was named Duke of Gloucester and made both a Knight of the Garter and a Knight of the Bath. Edward appointed him the sole Commissioner of Array for the Western Counties in 1464 when he was 11. By the age of 17, he had an independent command.

Richard spent several years during his childhood at Middleham Castle in Wensleydale, Yorkshire, under the tutelage of his cousin Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, later known as &#x27;the Kingmaker&#x27; because of his role in the Wars of the Roses. Warwick supervised Richard&#x27;s training as a knight; in the autumn of 1465, Edward IV granted Warwick £1,000 for the expenses of his younger brother&#x27;s tutelage. With some interruptions, Richard stayed at Middleham either from late 1461 until early 1465, when he was 12 or from 1465 until his coming of age in 1468, when he turned 16. While at Warwick&#x27;s estate, it is likely that he met both Francis Lovell, who was his firm supporter later in his life, and Warwick&#x27;s younger daughter, his future wife Anne Neville.

It is possible that even at this early stage Warwick was considering the king&#x27;s brothers as strategic matches for his daughters, Isabel and Anne: young aristocrats were often sent to be raised in the households of their intended future partners, as had been the case for the young dukes&#x27; father, Richard of York. As the relationship between the king and Warwick became strained, Edward IV opposed the match. During Warwick&#x27;s lifetime, George was the only royal brother to marry one of his daughters, the elder, Isabel, on 12 July 1469, without the king&#x27;s permission. George joined his father-in-law&#x27;s revolt against the king, while Richard remained loyal to Edward, even though he was rumoured to have been having an affair with Anne.

Richard and Edward were forced to flee to Burgundy in October 1470 after Warwick defected to the side of the former Lancastrian queen Margaret of Anjou. In 1468, Richard&#x27;s sister Margaret had married Charles the Bold, the Duke of Burgundy, and the brothers could expect a welcome there. Edward was restored to the throne in the spring of 1471, following the battles of Barnet and Tewkesbury, in both of which the 18-year-old Richard played a crucial role.

During his adolescence, and due to a cause that is unknown, Richard developed scoliosis, a sideways curvature of the spine. In 2014, after the discovery of Richard&#x27;s remains, the osteoarchaeologist Dr. Jo Appleby, of Leicester University&#x27;s School of Archaeology and Ancient History, imaged the spinal column, and reconstructed a model using 3D printing, and concluded that though the spinal scoliosis looked dramatic, it probably did not cause any major physical deformity that could not be disguised by clothing.

==Marriage and family relationships==
Following a decisive Yorkist victory over the Lancastrians at the Battle of Tewkesbury, Richard married Anne Neville on 12 July 1472. Anne had previously been wedded to Edward of Westminster, only son of Henry VI, to seal her father&#x27;s allegiance to the Lancastrian party. Edward died at the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May 1471, while Warwick had died at the Battle of Barnet on 14 April 1471. Richard&#x27;s marriage plans brought him into conflict with his brother George. John Paston&#x27;s letter of 17 February 1472 makes it clear that George was not happy about the marriage but grudgingly accepted it on the basis that &quot;he may well have my Lady his sister-in-law, but they shall part no livelihood&quot;. The reason was the inheritance Anne shared with her elder sister Isabel, whom George had married in 1469. It was not only the earldom that was at stake; Richard Neville had inherited it as a result of his marriage to Anne Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick. The Countess, who was still alive, was technically the owner of the substantial Beauchamp estates, her father having left no male heirs.

The Croyland Chronicle records that Richard agreed to a prenuptial contract in the following terms: &quot;the marriage of the Duke of Gloucester with Anne before-named was to take place, and he was to have such and so much of the earl&#x27;s lands as should be agreed upon between them through the mediation of arbitrators; while all the rest were to remain in the possession of the Duke of Clarence&quot;. The date of Paston&#x27;s letter suggests the marriage was still being negotiated in February 1472. In order to win George&#x27;s final consent to the marriage, Richard renounced most of the Earl of Warwick&#x27;s land and property including the earldoms of Warwick (which the Kingmaker had held in his wife&#x27;s right) and Salisbury and surrendered to George the office of Great Chamberlain of England. Richard retained Neville&#x27;s forfeit estates he had already been granted in the summer of 1471: Penrith, Sheriff Hutton and Middleham, where he later established his marital household.

The requisite papal dispensation was obtained dated 22 April 1472. Michael Hicks has suggested that the terms of the dispensation deliberately understated the degrees of consanguinity between the couple, and the marriage was therefore illegal on the ground of first-degree consanguinity following George&#x27;s marriage to Anne&#x27;s sister Isabel. There would have been first-degree consanguinity if Richard had sought to marry Isabel (in case of widowhood) after she had married his brother George, but no such consanguinity applied for Anne and Richard. Richard&#x27;s marriage to Anne was never declared null, and it was public to everyone including secular and canon lawyers for 13 years.

In June 1473, Richard persuaded his mother-in-law to leave the sanctuary and come to live under his protection at Middleham. Later in the year, under the terms of the 1473 Act of Resumption, George lost some of the property he held under royal grant and made no secret of his displeasure. John Paston&#x27;s letter of November 1473 says that King Edward planned to put both his younger brothers in their place by acting as &quot;a stifler atween them&quot;. Early in 1474, Parliament assembled and Edward attempted to reconcile his brothers by stating that both men, and their wives, would enjoy the Warwick inheritance just as if the Countess of Warwick &quot;was naturally dead&quot;. The doubts cast by George on the validity of Richard and Anne&#x27;s marriage were addressed by a clause protecting their rights in the event they were divorced (i.e. of their marriage being declared null and void by the Church) and then legally remarried to each other, and also protected Richard&#x27;s rights while waiting for such a valid second marriage with Anne. The following year, Richard was rewarded with all the Neville lands in the north of England, at the expense of Anne&#x27;s cousin, George Neville, 1st Duke of Bedford. From this point, George seems to have fallen steadily out of King Edward&#x27;s favour, his discontent coming to a head in 1477 when, following Isabel&#x27;s death, he was denied the opportunity to marry Mary of Burgundy, the stepdaughter of his sister Margaret, even though Margaret approved the proposed match. There is no evidence of Richard&#x27;s involvement in George&#x27;s subsequent conviction and execution on a charge of treason.

==Reign of Edward IV==
===Estates and titles===
Richard was granted the Dukedom of Gloucester on 1 November 1461, and on 12 August the next year was awarded large estates in northern England, including the lordships of Richmond in Yorkshire, and Pembroke in Wales. He gained the forfeited lands of the Lancastrian John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford, in East Anglia. In 1462, on his birthday, he was made Constable of Gloucester and Corfe Castles and Admiral of England, Ireland and Aquitaine and appointed Governor of the North, becoming the richest and most powerful noble in England. On 17 October 1469, he was made Constable of England. In November, he replaced William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings, as Chief Justice of North Wales. The following year, he was appointed Chief Steward and Chamberlain of Wales. On 18 May 1471, Richard was named Great Chamberlain and Lord High Admiral of England. Other positions followed: High Sheriff of Cumberland for life, Lieutenant of the North and Commander-in-Chief against the Scots and hereditary Warden of the West March. Two months later, on 14 July, he gained the Lordships of the strongholds Sheriff Hutton and Middleham in Yorkshire and Penrith in Cumberland, which had belonged to Warwick the Kingmaker. It is possible that the grant of Middleham seconded Richard&#x27;s personal wishes.

===Exile and return===
During the latter part of Edward IV&#x27;s reign, Richard demonstrated his loyalty to the king, in contrast to their brother George who had allied himself with the Earl of Warwick when the latter rebelled towards the end of the 1460s. Following Warwick&#x27;s 1470 rebellion, before which he had made peace with Margaret of Anjou and promised the restoration of Henry VI to the English throne, Richard, the Baron Hastings and Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, escaped capture at Doncaster by Warwick&#x27;s brother, John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu. On 2 October they sailed from King&#x27;s Lynn in two ships; Edward landed at Marsdiep and Richard at Zeeland. It was said that, having left England in such haste as to possess almost nothing, Edward was forced to pay their passage with his fur cloak; certainly, Richard borrowed three pounds from Zeeland&#x27;s town bailiff. They were attainted by Warwick&#x27;s only Parliament on 26 November. They resided in Bruges with Louis de Gruthuse, who had been the Burgundian Ambassador to Edward&#x27;s court, but it was not until Louis XI of France declared war on Burgundy that Charles, Duke of Burgundy, assisted their return, providing, along with the Hanseatic merchants, 20,000 pounds, 36 ships and 1,200 men. They left Flushing for England on 11 March 1471. Warwick&#x27;s arrest of local sympathisers prevented them from landing in Yorkist East Anglia and on 14 March, after being separated in a storm, their ships ran ashore at Holderness. The town of Hull refused Edward entry. He gained entry to York by using the same claim as Henry of Bolingbroke had before deposing Richard II in 1399; that is, that he was merely reclaiming the Dukedom of York rather than the crown. It was in Edward&#x27;s attempt to regain his throne that Richard began to demonstrate his skill as a military commander.

===1471 military campaign===
Once Edward had regained the support of his brother George, he mounted a swift and decisive campaign to regain the crown through combat; it is believed that Richard was his principal lieutenant as some of the king&#x27;s earliest support came from members of Richard&#x27;s affinity, including Sir James Harrington and Sir William Parr, who brought 600 men-at-arms to them at Doncaster. Richard may have led the vanguard at the Battle of Barnet, in his first command, on 14 April 1471, where he outflanked the wing of Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, although the degree to which his command was fundamental may have been exaggerated. That Richard&#x27;s personal household sustained losses indicate he was in the thick of the fighting. A contemporary source is clear about his holding the vanguard for Edward at Tewkesbury, deployed against the Lancastrian vanguard under Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset, on 4 May 1471, and his role two days later, as Constable of England, sitting alongside John Howard as Earl Marshal, in the trial and sentencing of leading Lancastrians captured after the battle.

===1475 invasion of France===
At least in part resentful of King Louis XI&#x27;s previous support of his Lancastrian opponents, and possibly in support of his brother-in-law Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, Edward went to parliament in October 1472 for funding a military campaign, and eventually landed in Calais on 4 July 1475. Richard&#x27;s was the largest private contingent of his army. Although well known to have publicly been against the eventual treaty signed with Louis XI at Picquigny (and absent from the negotiations, in which one of his rank would have been expected to take a leading role), he acted as Edward&#x27;s witness when the king instructed his delegates to the French court, and received &#x27;some very fine presents&#x27; from Louis on a visit to the French king at Amiens. In refusing other gifts, which included &#x27;pensions&#x27; in the guise of &#x27;tribute&#x27;, he was joined only by Cardinal Bourchier. He supposedly disapproved of Edward&#x27;s policy of personally benefiting—politically and financially—from a campaign paid for out of a parliamentary grant, and hence out of public funds. Any military prowess was therefore not to be revealed further until the last years of Edward&#x27;s reign.

===The North, and the Council in the North===
Richard was the dominant magnate in the north of England until Edward IV&#x27;s death. There, and especially in the city of York, he was highly regarded; although it has been questioned whether this view was reciprocated by Richard. Edward IV delegated significant authority to Richard in the region. Kendall and later historians have suggested that this was with the intention of making Richard the &quot;Lord of the North&quot;; Peter Booth, however, has argued that &quot;instead of allowing his brother Richard &quot;carte blanche&quot;, [Edward] restricted his influence by using his own agent, Sir William Parr.&quot; Following Richard&#x27;s accession to the throne, he first established the Council of the North and made his nephew John de la Pole, 1st Earl of Lincoln, president and formally institutionalised this body as an offshoot of the royal Council; all its letters and judgements were issued on behalf of the king and in his name. The council had a budget of 2,000 marks per annum and had issued &quot;Regulations&quot; by July of that year: councillors to act impartially, declare vested interests and to meet at least every three months. Its main focus of operations was Yorkshire and the north-east and its responsibilities included land disputes, keeping of the king&#x27;s peace and punishing lawbreakers.

===War with Scotland===
Richard&#x27;s increasing role in the north from the mid-1470s to some extent explains his withdrawal from the royal court. He had been Warden of the West March on the Scottish border since 10 September 1470, and again from May 1471; he used Penrith as a base while &#x27;taking effectual measures&#x27; against the Scots, and &#x27;enjoyed the revenues of the estates&#x27; of the Forest of Cumberland while doing so. It was at the same time that the Duke of Gloucester was appointed High Sheriff of Cumberland for five consecutive years, being described as &#x27;of Penrith Castle&#x27; in 1478.

By 1480, war with Scotland was looming; on 12 May that year, he was appointed Lieutenant-General of the North (a position created for the occasion) as fears of a Scottish invasion grew. Louis XI of France had attempted to negotiate a military alliance with Scotland (in the tradition of the &quot;Auld Alliance&quot;), with the aim of attacking England, according to a contemporary French chronicler. Richard had the authority to summon the Border Levies and issue Commissions of Array to repel the Border raids. Together with the Earl of Northumberland, he launched counter-raids, and when the king and council formally declared war in November 1480, he was granted 10,000 pounds for wages.

The king failed to arrive to lead the English army and the result was intermittent skirmishing until early 1482. Richard witnessed the treaty with Alexander, Duke of Albany, brother of King James III of Scotland. Northumberland, Stanley, Dorset, Sir Edward Woodville, and Richard with approximately 20,000 men took the town of Berwick as part of the English invasion of Scotland. The castle held out until 24 August 1482, when Richard recaptured Berwick-upon-Tweed from the Kingdom of Scotland. Although it is debatable whether the English victory was due more to internal Scottish divisions rather than any outstanding military prowess by Richard, it was the last time that the Royal Burgh of Berwick changed hands between the two realms.

==Lord Protector==
On the death of Edward IV on 9 April 1483, his 12-year-old son, Edward V, succeeded him. Richard was named Lord Protector of the Realm and at Baron Hastings&#x27; urging, Richard assumed his role and left his base in Yorkshire for London. On 29 April, as previously agreed, Richard and his cousin, Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham, met Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s brother, with Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers, at Northampton. At the queen&#x27;s request, Earl Rivers was escorting the young king to London with an armed escort of 2,000 men, while Richard and Buckingham&#x27;s joint escort was 600 men. Edward V had been sent further south to Stony Stratford. At first convivial, Richard had Earl Rivers, his nephew Richard Grey and his associate, Thomas Vaughan, arrested. They were taken to Pontefract Castle, where they were executed on 25 June on the charge of treason against the Lord Protector after appearing before a tribunal led by Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland. Rivers had appointed Richard as executor of his will.

After having Rivers arrested, Richard and Buckingham moved to Stony Stratford, where Richard informed Edward V of a plot aimed at denying him his role as protector and whose perpetrators had been dealt with. He proceeded to escort the king to London. They entered the city on 4 May, displaying the carriages of weapons Rivers had taken with his 2,000-man army. Richard first accommodated Edward in the Bishop&#x27;s apartments; then, on Buckingham&#x27;s suggestion, the king was moved to the royal apartments of the Tower of London, where kings customarily awaited their coronation. Within the year 1483, Richard had moved himself to the grandeur of Crosby Hall, London, then in Bishopsgate in the City of London. Robert Fabyan, in his &#x27;The new chronicles of England and of France&#x27;, writes that &quot;the Duke caused the King (Edward V) to be removed unto the Tower and his broder with hym, and the Duke lodged himselfe in Crosbyes Place in Bisshoppesgate Strete.&quot; In &quot;Holinshed&#x27;s Chronicles&quot; of England, Scotland, and Ireland, he accounts that &quot;little by little all folke withdrew from the Tower, and drew unto Crosbies in Bishops gates Street, where the Protector kept his houshold. The Protector had the resort; the King in maner desolate.&quot;

On hearing the news of her brother&#x27;s 30 April arrest, the dowager queen fled to sanctuary in Westminster Abbey. Joining her were her son by her first marriage, Thomas Grey, 1st Marquess of Dorset; her five daughters; and her youngest son, Richard of Shrewsbury, Duke of York. On 10/11 June, Richard wrote to Ralph, Lord Neville, the City of York and others asking for their support against &quot;the Queen, her blood adherents and affinity&quot; whom he suspected of plotting his murder. At a council meeting on 13 June at the Tower of London, Richard accused Hastings and others of having conspired against him with the Woodvilles and accusing Jane Shore, lover to both Hastings and Thomas Grey, of acting as a go-between. According to Thomas More, Hastings was taken out of the council chambers and summarily executed in the courtyard, while others, like Lord Thomas Stanley and John Morton, Bishop of Ely, were arrested. Hastings was not attainted and Richard sealed an indenture that placed Hastings&#x27; widow, Katherine, under his protection. Bishop Morton was released into the custody of Buckingham. On 16 June, the dowager queen agreed to hand over the Duke of York to the Archbishop of Canterbury so that he might attend his brother Edward&#x27;s coronation, still planned for 22 June.

==King of England==

Robert Stillington, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, is said to have informed Richard that Edward IV&#x27;s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville was invalid because of Edward&#x27;s earlier union with Eleanor Butler, making Edward V and his siblings illegitimate. The identity of Stillington was known only through the memoirs of the French diplomat, Philippe de Commines. On 22 June, a sermon was preached outside Old St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral by Ralph Shaa, declaring Edward IV&#x27;s children bastards and Richard the rightful king. Shortly after, the citizens of London, nobles and commons, convened and drew up a petition asking Richard to assume the throne. He accepted on 26 June and was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 6 July. His title to the throne was confirmed by Parliament in January 1484 by the document &quot;Titulus Regius&quot;.

The princes, who were still lodged in the royal residence of the Tower of London at the time of Richard&#x27;s coronation, disappeared from sight after the summer of 1483. Although after his death Richard III was accused of having Edward and his brother killed, notably by More and in Shakespeare&#x27;s play, the facts surrounding their disappearance remain unknown. Other culprits have been suggested, including Buckingham and even Henry VII, although Richard remains the primary suspect.

After the coronation ceremony, Richard and Anne set out on a royal progress to meet their subjects. During this journey through the country, the king and queen endowed King&#x27;s College and Queens&#x27; College at Cambridge University, and made grants to the church. Still feeling a strong bond with his northern estates, Richard later planned the establishment of a large chantry chapel in York Minster with over 100 priests. He also founded the College of Arms.

===Buckingham&#x27;s rebellion of 1483===
In 1483, a conspiracy arose among a number of disaffected gentry, many of whom had been supporters of Edward IV and the &quot;whole Yorkist establishment&quot;. The conspiracy was nominally led by Richard&#x27;s former ally, the Duke of Buckingham, although it had begun as a Woodville-Beaufort conspiracy (being &quot;well underway&quot; by the time of the Duke&#x27;s involvement). Davies has suggested that it was &quot;only the subsequent parliamentary attainder that placed Buckingham at the centre of events&quot;, to blame a disaffected magnate motivated by greed, rather than &quot;the embarrassing truth&quot; that those opposing Richard were actually &quot;overwhelmingly Edwardian loyalists&quot;. It is possible that they planned to depose Richard III and place Edward V back on the throne, and that when rumours arose that Edward and his brother were dead, Buckingham proposed that Henry Tudor should return from exile, take the throne and marry Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Edward IV. It has also been pointed out that as this narrative stems from Richard&#x27;s parliament of 1484, it should probably be treated &quot;with caution&quot;. For his part, Buckingham raised a substantial force from his estates in Wales and the Marches. Henry, in exile in Brittany, enjoyed the support of the Breton treasurer Pierre Landais, who hoped Buckingham&#x27;s victory would cement an alliance between Brittany and England.

Some of Henry Tudor&#x27;s ships ran into a storm and were forced to return to Brittany or Normandy, while Henry anchored off Plymouth for a week before learning of Buckingham&#x27;s failure. Buckingham&#x27;s army was troubled by the same storm and deserted when Richard&#x27;s forces came against them. Buckingham tried to escape in disguise but was either turned in by a retainer for the bounty Richard had put on his head, or was discovered in hiding with him. He was convicted of treason and beheaded in Salisbury, near the Bull&#x27;s Head Inn, on 2 November. His widow, Catherine Woodville, later married Jasper Tudor, the uncle of Henry Tudor. Richard made overtures to Landais, offering military support for Landais&#x27;s weak regime under Francis II, Duke of Brittany, in exchange for Henry. Henry fled to Paris, where he secured support from the French regent Anne of Beaujeu, who supplied troops for an invasion in 1485.

==Death at the Battle of Bosworth Field==
On 22 August 1485, Richard met the outnumbered forces of Henry Tudor at the Battle of Bosworth Field. Richard rode a white courser (an especially swift and strong horse). The size of Richard&#x27;s army has been estimated at 8,000 and Henry&#x27;s at 5,000, but exact numbers are not known, though the royal army is believed to have &quot;substantially&quot; outnumbered Henry&#x27;s. The traditional view of the king&#x27;s famous cries of &quot;Treason!&quot; before falling was that during the battle Richard was abandoned by Baron Stanley (made Earl of Derby in October), Sir William Stanley, and Henry Percy, 4th Earl of Northumberland. The role of Northumberland is unclear; his position was with the reserve—behind the king&#x27;s line—and he could not easily have moved forward without a general royal advance, which did not take place.

The physical confines behind the crest of Ambion Hill, combined with a difficulty of communications, probably physically hampered any attempt he made to join the fray. Despite appearing &quot;a pillar of the Ricardian regime&quot; and his previous loyalty to Edward IV, Baron Stanley was the stepfather of Henry Tudor and Stanley&#x27;s inaction combined with his brother&#x27;s entering the battle on Tudor&#x27;s behalf was fundamental to Richard&#x27;s defeat. The death of Richard&#x27;s close companion John Howard, Duke of Norfolk, may have had a demoralising effect on the king and his men. Either way, Richard led a cavalry charge deep into the enemy ranks in an attempt to end the battle quickly by striking at Henry Tudor.
All accounts note that King Richard fought bravely and ably during this manoeuvre, unhorsing Sir John Cheyne, a well-known jousting champion, killing Henry&#x27;s standard bearer Sir William Brandon and coming within a sword&#x27;s length of Henry Tudor before being surrounded by Sir William Stanley&#x27;s men and killed. Polydore Vergil, Henry VII&#x27;s official historian, recorded that &quot;King Richard, alone, was killed fighting manfully in the thickest press of his enemies&quot;. The Burgundian chronicler, Jean Molinet, states that a Welshman struck the death blow with a halberd while Richard&#x27;s horse was stuck in the marshy ground. It was said that the blows were so violent that the king&#x27;s helmet was driven into his skull. The contemporary Welsh poet Guto&#x27;r Glyn implies a leading Welsh Lancastrian, Rhys ap Thomas, or one of his men killed the king, writing that he &quot;killed the boar, shaved his head&quot;.

The identification in 2013 of King Richard&#x27;s body shows that the skeleton had 11 wounds, eight of them to the skull, clearly inflicted in battle and suggesting he had lost his helmet. Professor Guy Rutty, from the University of Leicester, said: &quot;The most likely injuries to have caused the king&#x27;s death are the two to the inferior aspect of the skull—a large sharp force trauma possibly from a sword or staff weapon, such as a halberd or bill, and a penetrating injury from the tip of an edged weapon.&quot; The skull showed that a blade had hacked away part of the rear of the skull. Richard III was the last English king to be killed in battle. Henry Tudor succeeded Richard as King Henry VII. He married the Yorkist heiress Elizabeth of York, Edward IV&#x27;s daughter and Richard III&#x27;s niece.
After the Battle of Bosworth, Richard&#x27;s naked body was then carried back to Leicester tied to a horse, and early sources strongly suggest that it was displayed in the collegiate Church of the Annunciation of Our Lady of the Newarke, prior to being hastily and discreetly buried in the choir of Greyfriars Church in Leicester. In 1495, Henry VII paid 50 pounds for a marble and alabaster monument. According to a discredited tradition, during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, his body was thrown into the River Soar, although other evidence suggests that a memorial stone was visible in 1612, in a garden built on the site of Greyfriars. The exact location was then lost, owing to more than 400 years of subsequent development, until archaeological investigations in 2012 revealed the site of the garden and Greyfriars Church. There was a memorial ledger stone in the choir of the cathedral, since replaced by the tomb of the king, and a stone plaque on Bow Bridge where tradition had falsely suggested that his remains had been thrown into the river.

According to another tradition, Richard consulted a in Leicester before the battle who foretold that &quot;where your spur should strike on the ride into battle, your head shall be broken on the return&quot;. On the ride into battle, his spur struck the bridge stone of Bow Bridge in the city; legend states that as his corpse was carried from the battle over the back of a horse, his head struck the same stone and was broken open.

==Legacy==
Richard&#x27;s Council of the North, described as his &quot;one major institutional innovation&quot;, derived from his ducal council following his own viceregal appointment by Edward IV; when Richard himself became king, he maintained the same conciliar structure in his absence. It officially became part of the royal council machinery under the presidency of John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln in April 1484, based at Sandal Castle in Wakefield. It is considered to have greatly improved conditions for northern England, as it was intended to keep the peace and punish lawbreakers, as well as resolve land disputes. Bringing regional governance directly under the control of central government, it has been described as the king&#x27;s &quot;most enduring monument&quot;, surviving unchanged until 1641.

In December 1483, Richard instituted what later became known as the Court of Requests, a court to which poor people who could not afford legal representation could apply for their grievances to be heard. He also improved bail in January 1484, to protect suspected felons from imprisonment before trial and to protect their property from seizure during that time. He founded the College of Arms in 1484, he banned restrictions on the printing and sale of books, and he ordered the translation of the written Laws and Statutes from the traditional French into English. During his reign, Parliament ended the arbitrary benevolence (a device by which Edward IV raised funds), made it punishable to conceal from a buyer of land that a part of the property had already been disposed of to somebody else, required that land sales be published, laid down property qualifications for jurors, restricted the abusive Courts of Piepowders, regulated cloth sales, instituted certain forms of trade protectionism, prohibited the sale of wine and oil in fraudulent measure, and prohibited fraudulent collection of clergy dues, among others. Churchill implies he improved the law of trusts.

Richard&#x27;s death at Bosworth marked the end of the Plantagenet dynasty, which had ruled England since the succession of Henry II in 1154. The last legitimate male Plantagenet, Richard&#x27;s nephew Edward, Earl of Warwick (son of his brother George, Duke of Clarence), was executed by Henry VII in 1499.

===Reputation===
There are numerous contemporary, or near-contemporary, sources of information about the reign of Richard III. These include the &quot;Croyland Chronicle&quot;, Commines&#x27; &quot;Mémoires&quot;, the report of Dominic Mancini, the Paston Letters, the Chronicles of Robert Fabyan and numerous court and official records, including a few letters by Richard himself. However, the debate about Richard&#x27;s true character and motives continues, both because of the subjectivity of many of the written sources, reflecting the generally partisan nature of writers of this period, and because none was written by men with an intimate knowledge of Richard.

During Richard&#x27;s reign, the historian John Rous praised him as a &quot;good lord&quot; who punished &quot;oppressors of the commons&quot;, adding that he had &quot;a great heart&quot;. In 1483, the Italian observer Mancini reported that Richard enjoyed a good reputation and that both &quot;his private life and public activities powerfully attracted the esteem of strangers&quot;. His bond to the City of York, in particular, was such that on hearing of Richard&#x27;s demise at the battle of Bosworth the City Council officially deplored the king&#x27;s death, at the risk of facing the victor&#x27;s wrath.

During his lifetime he was the subject of some attacks. Even in the North in 1482, a man was prosecuted for offences against the Duke of Gloucester, saying he did &quot;nothing but grin at&quot; the city of York. In 1484, attempts to discredit him took the form of hostile placards, the only surviving one being William Collingbourne&#x27;s lampoon of July 1484 &quot;The Cat, the Rat, and Lovell the Dog, all rule England under a Hog&quot; which was pinned to the door of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and referred to Richard himself (the Hog) and his most trusted councillors William Catesby, Richard Ratcliffe and Francis, Viscount Lovell. On 30 March 1485 Richard felt forced to summon the Lords and London City Councillors to publicly deny the rumours that he had poisoned Queen Anne and that he had planned marriage to his niece Elizabeth, at the same time ordering the Sheriff of London to imprison anyone spreading such slanders. The same orders were issued throughout the realm, including York where the royal pronouncement recorded in the City Records dates 5 April 1485 and carries specific instructions to suppress seditious talk and remove and destroy evidently hostile placards unread.

As for Richard&#x27;s physical appearance, most contemporary descriptions bear out the evidence that aside from having one shoulder higher than the other (with chronicler Rous not able to correctly remember which one, as slight as the difference was), Richard had no other noticeable bodily deformity. John Stow talked to old men who, remembering him, said &quot;that he was of bodily shape comely enough, only of low stature&quot; and a German traveller, Nicolas von Poppelau, who spent ten days in Richard&#x27;s household in May 1484, describes him as &quot;three fingers taller than himself...much more lean, with delicate arms and legs and also a great heart.&quot; Six years after Richard&#x27;s death, in 1491, a schoolmaster named William Burton, on hearing a defence of Richard, launched into a diatribe, accusing the dead king of being &quot;a hypocrite and a crookback...who was deservedly buried in a ditch like a dog.&quot;

Richard&#x27;s death encouraged the furtherance of this later negative image by his Tudor successors due to the fact that it helped to legitimise Henry VII&#x27;s seizure of the throne. The Richard III Society contends that this means that &quot;a lot of what people thought they knew about Richard III was pretty much propaganda and myth building.&quot; The Tudor characterisation culminated in the famous fictional portrayal of him in Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot; as a physically deformed, Machiavellian villain, ruthlessly committing numerous murders in order to claw his way to power; Shakespeare&#x27;s intention perhaps being to use Richard III as a vehicle for creating his own Marlowesque protagonist. Rous himself in his &quot;History of the Kings of England&quot;, written during Henry VII&#x27;s reign, initiated the process. He reversed his earlier position, and now portrayed Richard as a freakish individual who was born with teeth and shoulder-length hair after having been in his mother&#x27;s womb for two years. His body was stunted and distorted, with one shoulder higher than the other, and he was &quot;slight in body and weak in strength&quot;. Rous also attributes the murder of Henry VI to Richard, and claims that he poisoned his own wife. Jeremy Potter, a former Chair of the Richard III Society, claims that &quot;At the bar of history Richard III continues to be guilty because it is impossible to prove him innocent. The Tudors ride high in popular esteem.&quot;

Polydore Vergil and Thomas More expanded on this portrayal, emphasising Richard&#x27;s outward physical deformities as a sign of his inwardly twisted mind. More describes him as &quot;little of stature, ill-featured of limbs, crook-backed ... hard-favoured of visage&quot;. Vergil also says he was &quot;deformed of body ... one shoulder higher than the right&quot;. Both emphasise that Richard was devious and flattering, while planning the downfall of both his enemies and supposed friends. Richard&#x27;s good qualities were his cleverness and bravery. All these characteristics are repeated by Shakespeare, who portrays him as having a hunch, a limp and a withered arm. With regard to the &quot;hunch&quot;, the second quarto edition of &quot;Richard III&quot; (1598) used the term &quot;hunched-backed&quot; but in the First Folio edition (1623) it became &quot;bunch-backed&quot;.

Richard&#x27;s reputation as a promoter of legal fairness persisted, however. William Camden in his &quot;Remains Concerning Britain&quot; (1605) states that Richard, &quot;albeit he lived wickedly, yet made good laws&quot;. Francis Bacon also states that he was &quot;a good lawmaker for the ease and solace of the common people&quot;. In 1525, Cardinal Wolsey upbraided the aldermen and Mayor of London for relying on a statute of Richard to avoid paying an extorted tax (benevolence) but received the reply &quot;although he did evil, yet in his time were many good acts made.&quot;

Richard was a practising Catholic, as shown by his personal Book of Hours, surviving in the Lambeth Palace library. As well as conventional aristocratic devotional texts, the book contains a Collect of Saint Ninian, referencing a saint popular in the Anglo-Scottish Borders.

Despite this, the image of Richard as a ruthless tyrant remained dominant in the 18th and 19th centuries. The 18th-century philosopher and historian David Hume described him as a man who used dissimulation to conceal &quot;his fierce and savage nature&quot; and who had &quot;abandoned all principles of honour and humanity&quot;. Hume acknowledged that some historians have argued &quot;that he was well qualified for government, had he legally obtained it; and that he committed no crimes but such as were necessary to procure him possession of the crown&quot;, but he dismissed this view on the grounds that Richard&#x27;s exercise of arbitrary power encouraged instability. The most important late 19th century biographer of the king was James Gairdner, who also wrote the entry on Richard in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;. Gairdner stated that he had begun to study Richard with a neutral viewpoint, but became convinced that Shakespeare and More were essentially correct in their view of the king, despite some exaggerations.

Richard was not without his defenders, the first of whom was Sir George Buck, a descendant of one of the king&#x27;s supporters, who completed &quot;The history of King Richard the Third&quot; in 1619. The authoritative Buck text was published only in 1979, though a corrupted version was published by Buck&#x27;s great-nephew in 1646. Buck attacked the &quot;improbable imputations and strange and spiteful scandals&quot; related by Tudor writers, including Richard&#x27;s alleged deformities and murders. He located lost archival material, including the Titulus Regius, but also claimed to have seen a letter written by Elizabeth of York, according to which Elizabeth sought to marry the king. Elizabeth&#x27;s supposed letter was never produced. Documents which later emerged from the Portuguese royal archives show that after Queen Anne&#x27;s death, Richard&#x27;s ambassadors were sent on a formal errand to negotiate a double marriage between Richard and the Portuguese king&#x27;s sister Joanna, of Lancastrian descent, and between Elizabeth of York and Joanna&#x27;s cousin Manuel, Duke of Viseu (later King of Portugal).

Significant among Richard&#x27;s defenders was Horace Walpole. In &quot;Historic Doubts on the Life and Reign of King Richard the Third&quot; (1768), Walpole disputed all the alleged murders and argued that Richard may have acted in good faith. He also argued that any physical abnormality was probably no more than a minor distortion of the shoulders. However, he retracted his views in 1793 after the Terror, stating he now believed that Richard could have committed the crimes he was charged with, although Pollard observes that this retraction is frequently overlooked by later admirers of Richard. Other defenders of Richard include the noted explorer Clements Markham, whose &quot;Richard III: His Life and Character&quot; (1906) replied to the work of Gairdner. He argued that Henry VII killed the princes and that the bulk of evidence against Richard was nothing more than Tudor propaganda. An intermediate view was provided by Alfred Legge in &quot;The Unpopular King&quot; (1885). Legge argued that Richard&#x27;s &quot;greatness of soul&quot; was eventually &quot;warped and dwarfed&quot; by the ingratitude of others.

Some 20th-century historians have been less inclined to moral judgement, seeing Richard&#x27;s actions as a product of the unstable times. In the words of Charles Ross, &quot;the later fifteenth century in England is now seen as a ruthless and violent age as concerns the upper ranks of society, full of private feuds, intimidation, land-hunger, and litigiousness, and consideration of Richard&#x27;s life and career against this background has tended to remove him from the lonely pinnacle of Villainy Incarnate on which Shakespeare had placed him. Like most men, he was conditioned by the standards of his age.&quot; The Richard III Society, founded in 1924 as &quot;The Fellowship of the White Boar&quot;, is the oldest of several Ricardian groups dedicated to improving his reputation. Other historians still describe him as a &quot;power-hungry and ruthless politician&quot; who was most probably &quot;ultimately responsible for the murder of his nephews.&quot;

===In culture===

Richard III is the protagonist of &quot;Richard III&quot;, one of William Shakespeare&#x27;s history/tragedy plays. Apart from Shakespeare, he appears in many other works of literature. Two other plays of the Elizabethan era predated Shakespeare&#x27;s work. The Latin-language drama &quot;Richardus Tertius&quot; (first known performance in 1580) by Thomas Legge is believed to be the first history play written in England. The anonymous play &quot;The True Tragedy of Richard III&quot; (), performed in the same decade as Shakespeare&#x27;s work, was probably an influence on Shakespeare. Neither of the two plays places any emphasis on Richard&#x27;s physical appearance, though the &quot;True Tragedy&quot; briefly mentions that he is &quot;A man ill shaped, crooked backed, lame armed&quot; and &quot;valiantly minded, but tyrannous in authority&quot;. Both portray him as a man motivated by personal ambition, who uses everyone around him to get his way. Ben Jonson is also known to have written a play &quot;Richard Crookback&quot; in 1602, but it was never published and nothing is known about its portrayal of the king.

Marjorie Bowen&#x27;s 1929 novel &quot;Dickon&quot; set the trend for pro-Ricardian literature. Particularly influential was &quot;The Daughter of Time&quot; (1951) by Josephine Tey, in which a modern detective concludes that Richard III is innocent in the death of the Princes. Other novelists such as Valerie Anand in the novel &quot;Crown of Roses&quot; (1989) have also offered alternative versions to the theory that he murdered them. Sharon Kay Penman, in her historical novel &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot;, attributes the death of the Princes to the Duke of Buckingham. In the mystery novel &quot;The Murders of Richard III&quot; by Elizabeth Peters (1974) the central plot revolves around the debate as to whether Richard III was guilty of these and other crimes. A sympathetic portrayal is given in &quot;The Founding&quot; (1980), the first volume in &quot;The Morland Dynasty&quot; series by Cynthia Harrod-Eagles.

One film adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot; is the 1955 version directed and produced by Laurence Olivier, who also played the lead role. Also notable are the 1995 film version starring Ian McKellen, set in a fictional 1930s fascist England, and &quot;Looking for Richard&quot;, a 1996 documentary film directed by Al Pacino, who plays the title character as well as himself. The play has been adapted for television on several occasions.
==Discovery of remains==
On 24 August 2012, the University of Leicester, Leicester City Council and the Richard III Society, announced that they were going to look for the remains of King Richard. The search was managed by Philippa Langley of the Society&#x27;s Looking for Richard Project with the archaeology run by University of Leicester Archaeological Services (ULAS). The participants looked for the lost site of the former Greyfriars Church (demolished during Henry VIII&#x27;s dissolution of the monasteries) to find his remains. By comparing fixed points between maps, the church was found, where Richard&#x27;s body had been hastily buried without pomp in 1485, its foundations identifiable beneath a modern city centre car park.
In 1975 Audrey Strange of the Richard III Society predicted that the lost grave lay beneath one of the three car parks that partly cover the site of the former Grey Friars Priory. In the mid-1980s, academic David Baldwin, a medieval historian formerly of Leicester University, concluded that the burial site lay further to the east, beneath the northern (St Martin&#x27;s) end of Grey Friars Street, or the buildings that face it on either side.

The excavators found Greyfriars Church by 5 September 2012 and two days later announced that they had found Robert Herrick&#x27;s garden, where the memorial to Richard III stood in the early 17th century. A human skeleton was found beneath the Church&#x27;s choir.

The excavators found the remains in the course of the first excavation at the car park.

On 12 September, it was announced that the skeleton might be that of Richard III. Several reasons were given: the body was of an adult male; it was buried beneath the choir of the church; and there was severe scoliosis of the spine, possibly making one shoulder higher than the other. There was also what appeared to be an arrowhead embedded in the spine; and there were injuries to the skull. These included a shallow orifice which was probably caused by a rondel dagger, and a scooping depression to the skull that was probably inflicted by a sword.

Further, the bottom of the skull had a gaping hole, where a halberd had entered. Forensic pathologist Stuart Hamilton with APT, Matthew Rogers, said this injury would have left the man&#x27;s brain visible and certainly would have killed him. Jo Appleby, the osteo-archaeologist who excavated the skeleton, said it was &quot;a mortal battlefield wound in the back of the skull&quot;. The base of the skull had another fatal wound from a bladed weapon thrust, leaving a jagged hole. Inside the skull, there was evidence that the blade penetrated to a depth of .

In total, the skeleton had 10 wounds: four minor injuries on the top of the skull, one dagger blow on the cheekbone, one cut on the lower jaw, two fatal injuries on the base of the skull, one cut on a rib bone, and one final wound on the pelvis that was probably inflicted after death. It is generally accepted that Richard&#x27;s naked corpse was tied to the back of a horse, with his arms slung over one side and his legs and buttocks over the other. The angle of the blow on the pelvis suggests that one of those present stabbed Richard&#x27;s right buttock with substantial force, as the cut extends from the back to the front of the pelvic bone, an action intended to humiliate. It is also possible that Richard and his corpse suffered other injuries which left no trace on the skeleton.

British historian John Ashdown-Hill had used genealogical research in 2004 to trace matrilineal descendants of Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter, Richard&#x27;s elder sister. A British-born woman who emigrated to Canada after the Second World War, Joy Ibsen (), was found to be a 16th-generation great-niece of the king in the same direct maternal line. Her mitochondrial DNA was tested and belongs to mitochondrial DNA haplogroup J, which by deduction, should also be the mitochondrial DNA haplogroup of Richard III. Joy Ibsen died in 2008. Her son Michael Ibsen gave a mouth-swab sample to the research team on 24 August 2012. His mitochondrial DNA, passed down the direct maternal line, was compared to samples from the human remains found at the excavation site and used to identify King Richard.

On 4 February 2013, the University of Leicester confirmed that the skeleton was beyond reasonable doubt that of King Richard III. This conclusion was based on mitochondrial DNA evidence, soil analysis, and dental tests (there were some molars missing as a result of caries), as well as physical characteristics of the skeleton which are highly consistent with contemporary accounts of Richard&#x27;s appearance. The team announced that the &quot;arrowhead&quot; discovered with the body was a Roman-era nail, probably disturbed when the body was first interred. However, there were numerous perimortem wounds on the body, and part of the skull had been sliced off with a bladed weapon; this would have caused rapid death. The team concluded that it is unlikely the king was wearing a helmet in his last moments. Soil taken from the remains was found to contain microscopic roundworm eggs. Several eggs were found in samples taken from the pelvis, where the king&#x27;s intestines were, but not from the skull, and only very small numbers were identified in soil surrounding the grave. The findings suggest that the higher concentration of eggs in the pelvic area probably arose from a roundworm infection the king suffered in his life, rather than from human waste dumped in the area at a later date, researchers said. The mayor of Leicester announced that the king&#x27;s skeleton would be re-interred at Leicester Cathedral in early 2014, but a judicial review of that decision delayed the reinterment for a year. A museum to Richard III was opened in July 2014 in the Victorian school buildings next to the Greyfriars grave site.

On 5 February 2013 Caroline Wilkinson of the University of Dundee conducted a facial reconstruction of Richard III, commissioned by the Richard III Society, based on 3D mappings of his skull. The face is described as &quot;warm, young, earnest and rather serious&quot;. On 11 February 2014 the University of Leicester announced the project to sequence the entire genome of Richard III and one of his living relatives, Michael Ibsen, whose mitochondrial DNA confirmed the identification of the excavated remains. Richard III thus became the first ancient person of known historical identity whose genome has been sequenced.

In November 2014, the results of the DNA testing were published, confirming that the maternal side was as previously thought. The paternal side, however, demonstrated some variance from what had been expected, with the DNA showing no links between Richard and Henry Somerset, 5th Duke of Beaufort, a purported descendant of Richard&#x27;s great-great-grandfather Edward III of England. This could be the result of covert illegitimacy that does not reflect the accepted genealogies between Edward III and either Richard III or the 5th Duke of Beaufort.
===Reburial and tomb===
After his death in battle in 1485, Richard III&#x27;s body was buried in Greyfriars Church in Leicester. Following the discoveries of Richard&#x27;s remains in 2012, it was decided that they should be reburied at Leicester Cathedral, despite feelings in some quarters that he should have been reburied in York Minster. Those who challenged the decision included fifteen &quot;collateral [non-direct] descendants of Richard III&quot;, represented by the Plantagenet Alliance, who believed that the body should be reburied in York, as they claim the king wished. In August 2013, they filed a court case in order to contest Leicester&#x27;s claim to re-inter the body within its cathedral, and propose the body be buried in York instead. However, Michael Ibsen, who gave the DNA sample that identified the king, gave his support to Leicester&#x27;s claim to re-inter the body in their cathedral. On 20 August, a judge ruled that the opponents had the legal standing to contest his burial in Leicester Cathedral, despite a clause in the contract which had authorized the excavations requiring his burial there. He urged the parties, though, to settle out of court in order to &quot;avoid embarking on the Wars of the Roses, Part Two&quot;. The Plantagenet Alliance, and the supporting fifteen collateral descendants, also faced the challenge that &quot;Basic maths shows Richard, who had no surviving children but five siblings, could have millions of &#x27;collateral&#x27; descendants&quot; undermining the group&#x27;s claim to represent &quot;the only people who can speak on behalf of him&quot;. A ruling in May 2014 decreed that there are &quot;no public law grounds for the Court interfering with the decisions in question&quot;. The remains were taken to Leicester Cathedral on 22 March 2015 and reinterred on 26 March.

His remains were carried in procession to the cathedral on 22 March 2015, and reburied on 26 March 2015 at a religious re-burial service at which both Tim Stevens, the Bishop of Leicester, and Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated. Also present at the ceremony was Archbishop of Westminster and Roman Catholic Primate of England, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, as Richard III professed Catholicism. The British royal family was represented by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Countess of Wessex. The actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who later portrayed him in &quot;The Hollow Crown&quot; television series, read a poem by poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy.

Richard&#x27;s cathedral tomb was designed by the architects van Heyningen and Haward. The tombstone is deeply incised with a cross, and consists of a rectangular block of white Swaledale fossil stone, quarried in North Yorkshire. It sits on a low plinth made of dark Kilkenny marble, incised with Richard&#x27;s name, dates and motto (&quot;Loyaulte me lie&quot; – loyalty binds me). The plinth also carries his coat of arms in pietra dura. On top is a funeral crown commissioned specifically for the reinterment, and made by George Easton. The remains of Richard III are in a lead-lined inner casket, inside an outer English oak coffin crafted by Michael Ibsen, a direct descendant of Richard&#x27;s sister Anne, and laid in a brick-lined vault below the floor, and below the plinth and tombstone. The original 2010 raised tomb design had been proposed by Langley&#x27;s &quot;Looking For Richard Project&quot; and fully funded by members of the Richard III Society. The proposal was publicly launched by the Society on 13 February 2013 but rejected by Leicester Cathedral in favour of a memorial slab. However, following a public outcry, the Cathedral changed its position and on 18 July 2013 announced its agreement to give King Richard III a raised tomb monument.

==Issue==
Richard and Anne had one son, Edward of Middleham, who was born between 1474 and 1476. He was created Earl of Salisbury on 15 February 1478, and Prince of Wales on 24 August 1483, and died in March 1484, less than two months after he had been formally declared heir apparent. After the death of his son, Richard appointed his nephew John de la Pole, Earl of Lincoln, as Lieutenant of Ireland, an office previously held by his son Edward. Lincoln was the son of Richard&#x27;s older sister, Elizabeth, Duchess of Suffolk. After his wife&#x27;s death, Richard commenced negotiations with John II of Portugal to marry John&#x27;s sister Joanna. The pious princess had already turned down several suitors because of her preference for the religious life.

Richard had two acknowledged illegitimate children, John of Gloucester and Katherine Plantagenet. Also known as &#x27;John of Pontefract&#x27;, John of Gloucester was appointed Captain of Calais in 1485. Katherine married William Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, in 1484. Neither the birth dates nor the names of the mothers of either of the children are known. Katherine was old enough to be wedded in 1484, when the age of consent was twelve, and John was knighted in September 1483 in York Minster, and so most historians agree that they were both fathered when Richard was a teenager. There is no evidence of infidelity on Richard&#x27;s part after his marriage to Anne Neville in 1472 when he was around 20. This has led to a suggestion by the historian A. L. Rowse that Richard &quot;had no interest in sex&quot;.

Michael Hicks and Josephine Wilkinson have suggested that Katherine&#x27;s mother may have been Katherine Haute, on the basis of the grant of an annual payment of 100 shillings made to her in 1477. The Haute family was related to the Woodvilles through the marriage of Elizabeth Woodville&#x27;s aunt, Joan Wydeville, to William Haute. One of their children was Richard Haute, Controller of the Prince&#x27;s Household. Their daughter, Alice, married Sir John Fogge; they were ancestors to Catherine Parr, sixth wife of King Henry VIII.

Hicks and Wilkinson also suggest that John&#x27;s mother may have been Alice Burgh. Richard visited Pontefract from 1471, in April and October 1473, and in early March 1474, for a week. On 1 March 1474, he granted Alice Burgh 20 pounds a year for life &quot;for certain special causes and considerations&quot;. She later received another allowance, apparently for being engaged as a nurse for his brother George&#x27;s son, Edward of Warwick. Richard continued her annuity when he became king. John Ashdown-Hill has suggested that John was conceived during Richard&#x27;s first solo expedition to the eastern counties in the summer of 1467 at the invitation of John Howard and that the boy was born in 1468 and named after his friend and supporter. Richard himself noted John was still a minor (not being yet 21) when he issued the royal patent appointing him Captain of Calais on 11 March 1485, possibly on his seventeenth birthday.

Both of Richard&#x27;s illegitimate children survived him, but they seem to have died without issue and their fate after Richard&#x27;s demise at Bosworth is not certain. John received a 20-pound annuity from Henry VII, but there are no mentions of him in contemporary records after 1487 (the year of the Battle of Stoke Field). He may have been executed in 1499, though no record of this exists beyond an assertion by George Buck over a century later. Katherine apparently died before her cousin Elizabeth of York&#x27;s coronation on 25 November 1487, since her husband Sir William Herbert is described as a widower by that time. Katherine&#x27;s burial place was located in the London parish church of St James Garlickhithe, between Skinner&#x27;s Lane and Upper Thames Street.

The mysterious Richard Plantagenet, who was first mentioned in Francis Peck&#x27;s &quot;Desiderata Curiosa&quot; (a two-volume miscellany published 1732–1735) was said to be a possible illegitimate child of Richard III and is sometimes referred to as &quot;Richard the Master-Builder&quot; or &quot;Richard of Eastwell&quot;, but it has also been suggested he could have been Richard, Duke of York, one of the missing Princes in the Tower. He died in 1550.

==Titles, styles, honours and arms==
On 1 November 1461, Richard gained the title of Duke of Gloucester; in late 1461, he was invested as a Knight of the Garter. Following the death of King Edward IV, he was made Lord Protector of England. Richard held this office from 30 April to 26 June 1483, when he became king. During his reign, Richard was styled &quot;Dei Gratia Rex Angliae et Franciae et Dominus Hiberniae&quot; (by the Grace of God, King of England and France and Lord of Ireland).

Informally, he may have been known as &quot;Dickon&quot;, according to a sixteenth-century legend of a note, warning of treachery, that was sent to the Duke of Norfolk on the eve of Bosworth:
===Arms===
As Duke of Gloucester, Richard used the Royal Arms of France quartered with the Royal Arms of England, differenced by a label argent of three points ermine, on each point a canton gules, supported by a blue boar. As sovereign, he used the arms of the kingdom undifferenced, supported by a white boar and a lion. His motto was &quot;Loyaulte me lie&quot;, &quot;Loyalty binds me&quot;; and his personal device was a white boar.

<text>In molecular biology, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) is a technique that exploits variations in homologous DNA sequences, known as polymorphisms, populations, or species or to pinpoint the locations of genes within a sequence. The term may refer to a polymorphism itself, as detected through the differing locations of restriction enzyme sites, or to a related laboratory technique by which such differences can be illustrated. In RFLP analysis, a DNA sample is digested into fragments by one or more restriction enzymes, and the resulting &quot;restriction fragments&quot; are then separated by gel electrophoresis according to their size.

RFLP analysis is now largely obsolete due to the emergence of inexpensive DNA sequencing technologies, but it was the first DNA profiling technique inexpensive enough to see widespread application. RFLP analysis was an important early tool in genome mapping, localization of genes for genetic disorders, determination of risk for disease, and paternity testing.

==RFLP analysis==

The basic technique for the detection of RFLPs fragmenting a sample of DNA with the application of a restriction enzyme, which can selectively cleave a DNA molecule wherever a short, specific sequence is recognized in a process known as a restriction digest. The DNA fragments produced by the digest are then separated by length through a process known as agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a membrane via the Southern blot procedure. Hybridization of the membrane to a labeled DNA probe then determines the length of the fragments which are complementary to the probe. A restriction fragment length polymorphism is said to occur when the length of a detected fragment varies between individuals, indicating non-identical sequence homologies. Each fragment length is considered an allele, whether it actually contains a coding region or not, and can be used in subsequent genetic analysis.


===Examples===

There are two common mechanisms by which the size of a particular restriction fragment can vary. In the first schematic, a small segment of the genome is being detected by a DNA probe (thicker line). In allele &quot;A&quot;, the genome is cleaved by a restriction enzyme at three nearby sites (triangles), but only the rightmost fragment will be detected by the probe. In allele &quot;a&quot;, restriction site 2 has been lost by a mutation, so the probe now detects the larger fused fragment running from sites 1 to 3. The second diagram shows how this fragment size variation would look on a Southern blot, and how each allele (two per individual) might be inherited in members of a family.

In the third schematic, the probe and restriction enzyme are chosen to detect a region of the genome that includes a variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) segment (boxes in schematic diagram). In allele &quot;c&quot;, there are five repeats in the VNTR, and the probe detects a longer fragment between the two restriction sites. In allele &quot;d&quot;, there are only two repeats in the VNTR, so the probe detects a shorter fragment between the same two restriction sites. Other genetic processes, such as insertions, deletions, translocations, and inversions, can also lead to polymorphisms. RFLP tests require much larger samples of DNA than do short tandem repeat (STR) tests.

==Applications==

Analysis of RFLP variation in genomes was formerly a vital tool in genome mapping and genetic disease analysis. If researchers were trying to initially determine the chromosomal location of a particular disease gene, they would analyze the DNA of members of a family afflicted by the disease, and look for RFLP alleles that show a similar pattern of inheritance as that of the disease (see genetic linkage). Once a disease gene was localized, RFLP analysis of other families could reveal who was at risk for the disease, or who was likely to be a carrier of the mutant genes. RFLP test is used in identification and differentiation of organisms by analyzing unique patterns in genome. It is also used in identification of recombination rate in the loci between restriction sites.

RFLP analysis was also the basis for early methods of genetic fingerprinting, useful in the identification of samples retrieved from crime scenes, in the determination of paternity, and in the characterization of genetic diversity or breeding patterns in animal populations.

==Alternatives==

The technique for RFLP analysis is, however, slow and cumbersome. It requires a large amount of sample DNA, and the combined process of probe labeling, DNA fragmentation, electrophoresis, blotting, hybridization, washing, and autoradiography can take up to a month to complete. A limited version of the RFLP method that used oligonucleotide probes was reported in 1985. The results of the Human Genome Project have largely replaced the need for RFLP mapping, and the identification of many single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in that project (as well as the direct identification of many disease genes and mutations) has replaced the need for RFLP disease linkage analysis (see SNP genotyping). The analysis of VNTR alleles continues, but is now usually performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. For example, the standard protocols for DNA fingerprinting involve PCR analysis of panels of more than a dozen VNTRs.

RFLP is still used in marker-assisted selection. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP or sometimes T-RFLP) is a technique initially developed for characterizing bacterial communities in mixed-species samples. The technique has also been applied to other groups including soil fungi. TRFLP works by PCR amplification of DNA using primer pairs that have been labeled with fluorescent tags. The PCR products are then digested using RFLP enzymes and the resulting patterns visualized using a DNA sequencer. The results are analyzed either by simply counting and comparing bands or peaks in the TRFLP profile, or by matching bands from one or more TRFLP runs to a database of known species. A number of different software tools have been developed to automate the process of band matching, comparison and data basing of TRFLP profiles.

The technique is similar in some aspects to temperature gradient or denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE and DGGE).

The sequence changes directly involved with an RFLP can also be analyzed more quickly by PCR. Amplification can be directed across the altered restriction site, and the products digested with the restriction enzyme. This method has been called Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence (CAPS). Alternatively, the amplified segment can be analyzed by allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes, a process that can often be done by a simple dot blot.

<text>A hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher (, RPG) is a shoulder-fired anti-tank weapon that launches rockets equipped with a shaped-charge explosive warhead. Most RPGs can be carried by an individual soldier, and are frequently used as anti-tank weapons. These warheads are affixed to a rocket motor which propels the RPG towards the target and they are stabilized in flight with fins. Some types of RPG are reloadable with new anti-tank grenades, while others are single-use. RPGs are generally loaded from the front.

RPGs with high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads are very effective against lightly armored vehicles such as armored personnel carriers (APCs) and armored cars. However, modern, heavily-armored vehicles, such as upgraded APCs and main battle tanks, are generally too well-protected (with thick composite or reactive armor) to be penetrated by an RPG, unless less armored sections of the vehicle are exploited. Various warheads are also capable of causing secondary damage to vulnerable systems (especially sights, tracks, rear and roof of turrets) and other unarmored targets.

The term &quot;rocket-propelled grenade&quot; is a backronym from the Russian acronym (, ), meaning &#x27;hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher&#x27;, the name given to early Russian designs.

==History==
===Predecessor weapons===

The static nature of trench warfare in World War I encouraged the use of shielded defenses, even including personal armor, that were impenetrable by standard rifle ammunition. This led to some isolated experiments with higher caliber rifles, similar to elephant guns, using armor-piercing ammunition. The first tanks, the British Mark I, could be penetrated by these weapons under the right conditions. Mark IV tanks, however, had slightly thicker armor. In response, the Germans rushed to create an upgraded version of these early anti-armor rifles, the Tankgewehr M1918, the first anti-tank rifle. In the inter-war years, tank armor continued to increase overall, to the point that anti-tank rifles could no longer be effective against anything but light tanks; any rifle made powerful enough for heavier tanks would exceed the ability of a soldier to carry and fire the weapon.

Even with the first tanks, artillery officers often used field guns depressed to fire directly at armored targets. However, this practice expended much valuable ammunition and was of increasingly limited effectiveness as tank armor became thicker. This led to the concept of anti-tank guns, a form of artillery specifically designed to destroy armored fighting vehicles, normally from static defensive positions (that is, immobile during a battle).

The first dedicated anti-tank artillery began appearing in the 1920s, and by World War II was a common appearance in most armies. In order to penetrate armor they fired specialized ammunition from proportionally longer barrels to achieve a higher muzzle velocity than field guns. Most anti-tank guns were developed in the 1930s as improvements in tanks were noted, and nearly every major arms manufacturer produced one type or another.

Anti-tank guns deployed during World War II were manned by specialist infantry rather than artillery crews, and issued to infantry units accordingly. The anti-tank guns of the 1930s were of small caliber; nearly all major armies possessing them used ammunition, except for the British Army, which had developed the Ordnance QF 2-pounder. As World War II progressed, the appearance of heavier tanks rendered these weapons obsolete and anti-tank guns likewise began firing larger calibre and more effective armor-piercing shells. Although a number of large caliber guns were developed during the war that were capable of knocking out the most heavily armored tanks, they proved slow to set up and difficult to conceal. The latter generation of low-recoil anti-tank weapons, which allowed projectiles the size of an artillery shell to be fired from a man&#x27;s shoulder, was considered a far more viable option for arming infantrymen.

===First shaped charge, portable weapons===

The RPG has its roots in the 20th century with the early development of the explosive shaped charge, in which the explosive is made with a conical hollow, which concentrates its power on the impact point. Before the adoption of the shaped charge, anti-tank guns and tank guns relied primarily on kinetic energy of metal projectiles to defeat armor. Soldier-carried anti-tank rifles such as the Boys anti-tank rifle could be used against lightly-armored tankettes and light armored vehicles. However, as tank armor increased in thickness and effectiveness, the anti-tank guns needed to defeat them became increasingly heavy, cumbersome and expensive. During WW II, as tank armor got thicker, larger calibre anti-tank guns were developed to defeat this thicker armor.

While larger anti-tank guns were more effective, the weight of these anti-tank guns meant that they increasingly were mounted on wheeled, towed platforms. This meant that if the infantry was on foot, they might not have access to these wheeled, vehicle-towed anti-tank guns. This led to situations where infantry could find themselves defenseless against tanks and unable to attack tanks. Armies found that they needed to give infantry a human-portable (i.e., can be carried by one soldier) weapon to defeat enemy armor when no wheeled anti-tank guns were available, since anti tank rifles were no longer effective. Initial attempts to put such weapons in the hands of the infantry resulted in weapons like the Soviet RPG-40 &quot;blast effect&quot; hand grenade (where &quot;RPG&quot; stood for &quot;ruchnaya protivotankovaya granata&quot;, meaning hand-held anti-tank grenade). However, being hand thrown weapons, they still had to be deployed at suicidally close range to be effective. What was needed was a means of delivering the shaped charge warhead from a distance. Different approaches to this goal would lead to the anti-tank spigot mortar, the recoilless rifle, and, from the development of practical rocketry, the RPG.

Research occasioned by World War II produced such weapons as the American bazooka, British/Allied PIAT and German Panzerfaust, which combined portability with effectiveness against armored vehicles, such as tanks. The Soviet-developed RPG-7 is the most widely distributed, recognizable and used RPG in the world. The basic design of this RPG was developed by the Soviets shortly after World War II in the form of the RPG-2, which is similar in function to the Bazooka (due to the reloadability) and the Panzerfaust (due to an oversized grenade that protrudes outside of a smaller launch tube and the recoilless launch), though the rounds it fires lack a form of propulsion in addition to the launch charge (unlike the RPG-7 rounds, which also feature a sustainer motor, effectively making the rounds rocket propelled grenades).
Soviet RPGs were used extensively during the Vietnam War (by the Vietnam People&#x27;s Army and Vietcong), as well as during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan by the Mujahideen and against South Africans in Angola and Namibia (formerly South West Africa) by SWAPO guerillas during what the South Africans called the South African Border War. In the 2000s, they were still being used widely in conflict areas such as Chechnya, Iraq, and Sri Lanka. Militants have also used RPGs against helicopters: Taliban fighters shot down U.S. CH-47 Chinook helicopters in June 2005 and August 2011; and Somali militiamen shot down two U.S. UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters during the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993.

RPGs were used by militants to destroy &quot;hundreds&quot; of vehicles (AFVs, armored Humvees etc) in the War in Afghanistan (2001–2021).

==Design==

The RPG warhead being used against tanks and other armor often has a shaped charge explosive warhead. A shaped charge is an explosive charge shaped to focus the effect of the explosive&#x27;s energy. Various types are used to penetrate tank armor; typical modern lined shaped charge can penetrate steel armor to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD), though greater depths of 10 CD and above have been achieved. Despite the popular misconception that shaped charges &quot;melt&quot; tank armor, the shaped charge does not depend in any way on heating or melting for its effectiveness; that is, the superplastic metal jet from a shaped charge impact on armor forms mainly due to a sudden and intense mechanical stress and does not melt its way through armor, as its effect is purely due to kinetic energy in nature.

An RPG comprises two main parts: the launcher and a rocket equipped with a warhead that follows a ballistic trajectory after the rocket motor has completed its burn. The most common types of warheads are high explosive (HE) and high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) rounds. HE rounds can be used against troops or unarmored structures or vehicles. HEAT rounds can be used against armored vehicles. These warheads are affixed to a rocket motor and stabilized in flight with fins. Some types of RPG are single-use disposable units, such as the RPG-22 and M72 LAW; with these units, once the rocket is fired, the entire launcher is disposed of. Others are reloadable, such as the Soviet RPG-7 and the Israeli B-300. With reloadable RPGs, a new rocket can be inserted into the muzzle of the weapon after firing.

An issue that affected the earliest RPG weapon systems such as the German Panzerschreck was that rocket motor propellant could harm the operator. The weapon therefore featured a metal shield attached to the launch tube to protect the operator’s face from the blast. With later designs such as the RPG-7, the rocket exits the launcher with a low-powered gunpowder charge, and the main rocket motor then fires after the rocket has travelled . In some other designs, the propellant charge burns completely within the tube.

An RPG is an inexpensive way for an infantryman to safely deliver an explosive payload or warhead over a short distance with reasonable accuracy. Substantially more expensive guided anti-tank missiles are used at larger distances when accuracy or an overfly top attack are paramount. Anti-tank missiles such as the Malyutka can be guided by the operator after firing by sight, heat sensors or IR signatures; an RPG however is not guided towards the target. Nor can RPG rockets be controlled in flight after being aimed and launched. While the lack of active targeting technologies or after-firing guidance input can be viewed as a weakness, it also makes RPGs cheap and hard to defend against with electronic countermeasures or decoying. For example, if a soldier or other fighter launches an RPG at a hovering helicopter, even if the helicopter releases flares to confuse optical seekers, chaff to confuse radar, or engages in signal jamming, these will have no effect on an in-flight RPG warhead, even though these measures might protect against more sophisticated surface-to-air missiles.

===Warheads===


The HEAT (high-explosive anti-tank) round is a standard shaped charge warhead, similar in concept to those used in many tank cannon rounds. In this type of warhead, the shape of the explosive material within the warhead focuses the explosive energy on a copper (or similar metal) lining. This heats the metal lining and propels some of it forward at a very high velocity in a highly plastic state. The resulting narrow jet of metal can defeat armor equivalent to several hundred millimeters of RHA, such as that used in light and medium armored vehicles. However, heavily armored vehicles, such as main battle tanks, are generally too well armored to be penetrated by an RPG, unless weaker sections of the armor are exploited. Various warheads are also capable of causing secondary damage to vulnerable systems (especially sights, tracks, rear and roof of turrets) and other soft targets. The warhead detonates on impact or when the fuse runs out; usually the fuse is set to the maximum burn of the rocket motor, but it can be shortened for improvised anti aircraft purposes.

Specialized warheads are available for illumination, smoke, tear gas, and white phosphorus. Russia, China, and many former Warsaw Pact nations have also developed a fuel-air explosive (thermobaric) warhead. Another recent development is a tandem HEAT warhead capable of penetrating reactive armor.

So-called PRIGs (propelled recoilless improvised grenade) were improvised warheads used by the Provisional IRA.

===Effectiveness===
The RPG-29 uses a tandem-charge high-explosive anti-tank warhead to penetrate explosive reactive armor (ERA) as well as composite armor behind it.

In August 2006, in al-Amarah, in Iraq, a Soviet RPG-29 damaged the front underside of a Challenger 2 tank, detonating ERA in the area of the driver&#x27;s cabin. The driver lost part of a foot and two more of the crew were injured, but the driver was able to reverse to an aid post. The incident was not made public until May 2007; in response to accusations, the MoD said &quot;We have never claimed that the Challenger 2 is impenetrable.&quot; Since then, the ERA has been replaced with a Dorchester block and the steel underbelly lined with armor, as part of the &#x27;Streetfighter&#x27; upgrade, which was a direct response to this incident. In May 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot; disclosed that an American M1 tank had also been damaged by an RPG-29 in Iraq. The American army is ranking the RPG-29 threat to American armor as high; they have refused to allow the newly formed Iraqi army to buy it, fearing that it would fall into the hands of insurgents.

Various armies and manufacturers have developed add-on tank armor and other systems for urban combat, such as the Tank Urban Survival Kit (TUSK) for M1 Abrams, slat armor for the Stryker, ERA kit for the FV432, AZUR for Leclerc, and others. Similar solutions are active protection systems (APS), engaging and destroying closing projectiles, such as the Russian Drozd and Arena, as well as the recent Israeli Trophy Active Protection System.

The RPG-30 was designed to address the threat of active protection systems on tanks by using a false target to trick the APS. The RPG-30 shares a close resemblance with the RPG-27 in that it is a man-portable, disposable anti-tank rocket launcher with a single-shot capacity. However, unlike the RPG-27, there is a smaller diameter precursor round in a smaller side barrel tube in addition to the main round in the main tube. This precursor round acts as a false target, tricking the target&#x27;s active protection system into engaging it, allowing the main round a clear path into the target, while the APS is stuck in the 0.2–0.4 second delay it needs to start its next engagement. Recent German systems were able to reduce reaction delay to mere milliseconds, cancelling this advantage.

The PG-30 is the main round of the RPG-30. The round is a tandem shaped charge with a weight of and has a range of and a stated penetration capability in excess of rolled homogeneous armor (RHA) (after ERA), reinforced concrete, , and of soil. Reactive armor, including explosive reactive armor (ERA), can be defeated with multiple hits into the same place, such as by tandem-charge weapons, which fire two or more shaped charges in rapid succession.

===Protection===
An early method of disabling shaped charges developed during World War II was to apply thin skirt armor or meshwire at a distance around the hull and turret of the tank. The skirt or mesh armor (cage armor) triggers the RPG on contact and much of the energy that a shaped charge produces dissipates before coming into contact with the main armor of the vehicle. Well-sloped armor also gives some protection because the shaped charge is forced to penetrate a greater amount of armor due to the oblique angle. The benefits of cage armor are still considered great in modern battlefields in the Middle East, and although similar effects can be obtained using spaced armor, either as a part of the original design or as appliqué armor fitted later, cage armor is preferable due to its low weight and ease of repair.

Today, technologically advanced armies have implemented composite armors such as Chobham armour, which provide superior protection to steel. For added protection, vehicles may be retrofitted with reactive armor; on impact, reactive tiles explode or deform, disrupting the normal function of the shaped charge. Russian and Israeli vehicles also use active protection systems such as Drozd, Arena APS or Trophy. Such a system detects and shoots down incoming projectiles before they reach the vehicle. As in all arms races, these developments in armor countermeasures have led to the development of RPG rounds designed specifically to defeat them, with methods such as a tandem-charge warhead, which has two shaped charges, of which the first is meant to activate any reactive armor, and the second to penetrate the vehicle.

===United States===
The United States Army developed a lightweight antitank weapon (LAW) in the middle 1950s. By 1961, the M72 LAW was in use. It is a shoulder-fired, disposable rocket launcher with HEAT warhead. It is a recoilless weapon, which is easy to use, and effective against armored vehicles. It was used during the Vietnam War, and is still in use today. It uses a fin-stabilized rocket. In response to the threat of thicker armor, this weapon was replaced by the AT4 recoilless gun, a larger &amp; non-collapsible – albeit still single-shot weapon.

The United States Army and Marine Corps also use a different launcher, which is reloadable – the M3 Multi-role Anti-armor Anti-tank Weapon System (MAAWs) derived from the 84mm Carl Gustav and the 83mm Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW) derived from the Israeli B-300. Unlike the RPG, they are both reloaded from the breech-end rather than the muzzle.

==Tactics==
One of the first instances the weapon was used by militants was on January 13, 1975, at Orly Airport in France, when Carlos the Jackal, together with another member from the PFLP, used two Soviet RPG-7 grenades to attack an Israeli El Al airliner. Both missed the target, with one hitting a Yugoslav Airlines&#x27;s DC-9 instead.

In Afghanistan, Mujahideen guerrillas used RPG-7s to destroy Soviet vehicles. To assure a kill, two to four RPG operators would be assigned to each vehicle. Each armored-vehicle hunter-killer team can have as many as 15 RPGs. In areas where vehicles were confined to a single path (a mountain road, swamps, snow, urban areas), RPG teams trapped convoys by destroying the first and last vehicles in line, preventing movement of the other vehicles. This tactic was especially effective in cities. Convoys learned to avoid approaches with overhangs and to send infantrymen forward in hazardous areas to detect the RPG teams.

Multiple shooters were also effective against heavy tanks with reactive armor: The first shot would be against the driver&#x27;s viewing prisms. Following shots would be in pairs, one to set off the reactive armor, the second to penetrate the tank&#x27;s armor. Favored weak spots were the top and rear of the turret.

Afghans sometimes used RPG-7s at extreme range, exploded by their 4.5-second self-destruct timer, which translates to roughly flight distance, as a method of long distance approach denial for infantry and reconnaissance. The most noteworthy use of RPGs against aircraft in Afghanistan occurred on August 6, 2011, when Taliban fighters shot down a U.S. CH-47 Chinook helicopter killing all 38 personnel on board including SEAL Team 6 from a range of . An earlier anti-aircraft kill by the Taliban occurred during Operation Red Wings, on June 28, 2005, when a Chinook helicopter was destroyed by unguided RPG.

In the period following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the RPG-7 became a favorite weapon of the insurgent forces fighting U.S. troops. Since most of the readily available RPG-7 rounds cannot penetrate M1 Abrams tank armor from almost any angle, it is primarily effective against soft-skinned or lightly armored vehicles, and infantry. Even if the RPG hit does not completely disable the tank or kill the crew, it can still damage external equipment, lowering the tank&#x27;s effectiveness or forcing the crew to abandon and destroy it. Newer RPG-7 rounds are more capable, and in August 2006, an RPG-29 round penetrated the frontal ERA of a Challenger 2 tank during an engagement in al-Amarah, Iraq, and wounded several crew members.

RPGs were a main tool used by the FMLN&#x27;s guerrilla forces in the Salvadoran Civil War. For example, during the June 19, 1986, overrun of the San Miguel Army base, FMLN sappers dressed only in black shorts, their faces blacked out with grease, sneaked through barbed wire at night, avoiding the searchlights, they made it to within firing range of the outer wall. Using RPGs to initiate the attack, they blew through the wall and killed a number of Salvadorean soldiers. They eliminated the outermost sentries and searchlights with the rockets, then made it into the inner wall, which they also punched through. They were then able to create mayhem as their comrades attacked from the outside.

During the First (1994–1996) and Second Chechen Wars (1999–2009), Chechen rebels used RPGs to attack Russian tanks from basements and high rooftops. This tactic was effective because tank main guns could not be depressed or raised far enough to return fire, in addition, armor on the very top and bottom of tanks is usually the weakest. Russian forces had to rely on artillery suppression, good crew gunners and infantry screens to prevent such attacks. Tank columns were eventually protected by attached self-propelled anti-aircraft guns (ZSU-23-4 Shilka, 9K22 Tunguska) used in the ground role to suppress and destroy Chechen ambushes. Chechen fighters formed independent &quot;cells&quot; that worked together to destroy a specific Russian armored target. Each cell contained small arms and some form of RPG (RPG-7V or RPG-18, for example). The small arms were used to button the tank up and keep any infantry occupied, while the RPG gunner struck at the tank. While doing so, other teams would attempt to fire at the target in order to overwhelm the Russians&#x27; ability to effectively counter the attack. To further increase the chance of success, the teams took up positions at different elevations where possible. Firing from the third and higher floors allowed good shots at the weakest armor (the top). When the Russians began moving in tanks fitted with explosive reactive armor (ERA), the Chechens had to adapt their tactics, because the RPGs they had access to were unlikely to result in the destruction of the tank.

Using RPGs as improvised anti-aircraft batteries has proved successful in Somalia, Afghanistan, and Chechnya. Helicopters are typically ambushed as they land, take off or hover. In Afghanistan, the Mujahideen often modified RPGs for use against Soviet helicopters by adding a curved pipe to the rear of the launcher tube, which diverted the backblast, allowing the RPG to be fired upward at aircraft from a prone position. This made the operator less visible prior to firing and decreased the risk of injury from hot exhaust gases. The Mujahideen also utilized the 4.5-second timer on RPG rounds to make the weapon function as part of a flak battery, using multiple launchers to increase hit probabilities. At the time, Soviet helicopters countered the threat from RPGs at landing zones by first clearing them with anti-personnel saturation fire. The Soviets also varied the number of accompanying helicopters (two or three) in an effort to upset Afghan force estimations and preparation. In response, the Mujahideen prepared dug-in firing positions with top cover, and again, Soviet forces altered their tactics by using air-dropped thermobaric fuel-air bombs on such landing zones. As the U.S.-supplied Stinger surface-to-air missiles became available to them, the Afghans abandoned RPG attacks as the smart missiles proved especially efficient in the destruction of unarmed Soviet transport helicopters, such as Mil Mi-17. In Somalia, both of the UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters lost by U.S. forces during the Battle of Mogadishu in 1993 were downed by RPG-7s.
