<text>Robert Siodmak (; 8 August 1900 – 10 March 1973) was a German film director. His career spanned some 40 years, working extensively in the United States and France, as well as in his native country. Though he worked in many genres, he was best known as a skilled craftsman of thrillers and film noir, and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Director for &quot;The Killers&quot; (1946).

==Early life==
Siodmak was born in Dresden, Germany, the son of Rosa Philippine (née Blum) and Ignatz Siodmak and the brother of Curt, Werner and Roland. His parents were both from Jewish families in Leipzig (the myth of his American birth in Memphis, Tennessee was necessary for him to obtain a visa in Paris during World War II). He worked as a stage director and a banker before becoming editor and scenarist for Curtis Bernhardt in 1925 (Bernhardt directed a film of Siodmak&#x27;s story &quot;Conflict&quot; in 1945). At twenty-six he was hired by his cousin, producer Seymour Nebenzal, to assemble original silent movies from stock footage of old films. Siodmak worked at this for two years before he persuaded Nebenzal to finance his first feature, the silent masterpiece, &quot;Menschen am Sonntag&quot; (&quot;People on Sunday&quot;) in 1929. The script was co-written by Billy Wilder and Siodmak&#x27;s brother Curt Siodmak, later the screenwriter of &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; (1941). It was the last German silent and also included such future Hollywood artists as Fred Zinnemann, Edgar G. Ulmer, and Eugen Schufftan. His next film—the first at UFA to use sound—was the 1930 comedy &quot;Abschied&quot; for writers Emeric Pressburger and Irma von Cube, followed by &quot;Der Mann, der seinen Mörder sucht&quot;, another comedy, yet quite different and unusual, a likely product of Billy Wilder&#x27;s imagination. But in his next film, the crime thriller &quot;Stürme der Leidenschaft&quot;, with Emil Jannings and Anna Sten, Siodmak found a style that would become his own.

With the rise of Nazism and following an attack in the press by Hitler&#x27;s minister of propaganda Joseph Goebbels in 1933 after viewing &quot;Brennendes Geheimnis&quot; (&quot;The Burning Secret&quot;), Siodmak left Germany for Paris. His creativity flourished, as he worked for the next six years in a variety of film genres, from comedy (&quot;Le sexe faible&quot; and &quot;La Vie Parisienne&quot; ) to musical (&quot;La crise est finie&quot;, with Danielle Darrieux) to drama (&quot;Mister Flow&quot;, &quot;Cargaison blanche&quot;, &quot;Mollenard&quot;—compare Gabrielle Dorziat&#x27;s shrewish wife with that of Rosalind Ivan in &quot;The Suspect&quot;—and &quot;Pièges&quot;, with Maurice Chevalier and Erich von Stroheim). While in France, he was well on his way to becoming successor to Rene Clair, until Hitler again forced him out. Siodmak arrived in California in 1939, where he made 23 movies, many of them widely popular thrillers and crime melodramas, which critics today regard as classics of film noir.

==Hollywood career==
Beginning in 1941, he first turned out several B-films and programmers for various studios before he gained a seven-year contract with Universal Studios in 1943. The best of those early films are the thriller &quot;Fly by Night&quot; in 1942, with Richard Carlson and Nancy Kelly, and in 1943 &quot;Someone to Remember&quot;, with Mable Paige in a signature role. As house director, his services were often used to salvage troublesome productions at the studio. On Mark Hellinger&#x27;s production &quot;Swell Guy&quot; (1946), for instance, Siodmak was brought in to replace Frank Tuttle only six days after completing work on &quot;The Killers&quot;. Siodmak worked steadily while under contract, overshadowed by high-profile directors, like Alfred Hitchcock, with whom he had been often compared by the press.

At Universal, Siodmak made yet another B-film, &quot;Son of Dracula&quot; (1943), the third in the studio&#x27;s series of Dracula movies (based on his brother Curt&#x27;s original story). His second feature was the Maria Montez/Jon Hall vehicle, &quot;Cobra Woman&quot; (1944), made in Technicolor.

His first all-out noir was &quot;Phantom Lady&quot; (1944), for staff producer Joan Harrison, Universal&#x27;s first female executive and Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s former secretary and script assistant. It showcased Siodmak&#x27;s skill with camera and editing to dazzling effect, but no more so than in the iconic jam-session sequence with Elisha Cook Jr. in throes on the drums. Following the critical success of &quot;Phantom Lady&quot;, Siodmak directed &quot;Christmas Holiday&quot; (1944) with Deanna Durbin and Gene Kelly (Hans J. Salter received an Oscar nomination for best music). Beginning with this film, his work in Hollywood attained the stylistic and thematic characteristics that are evident in his later noirs. &quot;Christmas Holiday&quot;, adapted from a W. Somerset Maugham novel of the same title by Herman J. Mankiewicz, was Durbin&#x27;s most successful feature. Siodmak&#x27;s use of black-and-white cinematography and urban landscapes, together with his light-and-shadow designs, followed the basic structure of classic noir films. In fact, he had a number of collaborations with cinematographers, such as Nicholas Musuraca, Elwood Bredell, and Franz Planer, in which he achieved the Expressionist look he had cultivated in his early years at UFA. During Siodmak&#x27;s tenure, Universal made the most of the noir style in &quot;The Suspect&quot;, &quot;The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry&quot; and &quot;The Dark Mirror&quot;, but the capstone was &quot;The Killers&quot;. Released in 1946, it was Burt Lancaster&#x27;s film debut and Ava Gardner&#x27;s first dramatic, featured role. A critical and financial success, it earned Siodmak his only Oscar nomination for direction in Hollywood. His German production &quot;Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam&quot;, based on the false story of Bruno Lüdke, who was falsely accused of being a serial killer by the Nazis, was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film in 1957.

While still under contract at Universal, Siodmak worked on loan out to RKO for producer Dore Schary in the thriller &quot;The Spiral Staircase&quot;, a masterly blending of suspense and horror, which Siodmak said he edited as he pleased, due to a strike in Hollywood in 1945. The film earned Ethel Barrymore an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress. For 20th Century Fox and producer Darryl F. Zanuck, he directed, partly on location in New York City, the crime noir &quot;Cry of the City&quot; in 1948, and in 1949 for MGM he tackled its lux production &quot;The Great Sinner&quot;, but the prolix script proved unmanageable for Siodmak who relinquished direction to the dependable Mervyn LeRoy. On loan out to Paramount in 1949, he made for producer Hal B. Wallis his penultimate American noir &quot;The File on Thelma Jordon&quot;, with Barbara Stanwyck at her most fatal—and sympathetic. Siodmak saw in this film a thematic link with &quot;The Suspect&quot; and &quot;The Strange Affair of Uncle Harry&quot;, with the failed lovers of these films and significantly their tragic conclusions (ten years later he addressed the same theme in &quot;The Rough and the Smooth&quot;). Perhaps his finest American noir—although not his last—is &quot;Criss Cross&quot; that was to reunite him not only with Lancaster, but also &quot;The Killers&quot; producer Mark Hellinger, who died suddenly before production began in 1949. Working without the hands-on control of Hellinger again, Siodmak was able to make this film his own as he could not the earlier film. Yvonne De Carlo&#x27;s working-class femme fatal (a high mark in her career) completes the deadly triangle, along with Lancaster and Dan Duryea: the archetype of doomed attraction central to all Siodmak&#x27;s noirs, but the one he could fully express to its nihilistic conclusion.

Siodmak immersed himself in the creative process and genuinely loved working with actors, acquiring a reputation as an actor&#x27;s director for his work with many future stars, including Burt Lancaster, Ernest Borgnine, Tony Curtis, Debra Paget, Maria Schell, Mario Adorf, Ava Gardner, Olivia de Havilland, Dorothy McGuire, Yvonne de Carlo, Barbara Stanwyck, Geraldine Fitzgerald, and Ella Raines.

He directed Charles Laughton (a close friend) and George Sanders, and got from both perhaps the unlikeliest, most natural and under-acted performances of their careers. From Lon Chaney Jr. he drew an uncharacteristically controlled and coldly menacing performance for &quot;Son of Dracula&quot;. He managed with Lancaster to capture a youthful vulnerability in &quot;The Killers&quot;, despite the actor&#x27;s age (he was 33). He was able to get a believable, dramatic performance from Gene Kelly. He also helped raise Ava Gardner&#x27;s public profile.

==Return to Europe==
Before leaving for Europe in 1952, following the problematic production &quot;The Crimson Pirate&quot; for Norma Productions (distributed through Warner Bros.) and producer Harold Hecht, his third and last film with Burt Lancaster (Siodmak dubbed the chaotic experience &quot;The Hecht Follies&quot;), Siodmak had directed some of the era&#x27;s best films noirs (twelve in all), more than any other director who worked in that style. However, his identification with film noir, generally unpopular with American audiences, may have been more of a curse than a blessing.

He often expressed his desire to make pictures &quot;of a different type and background&quot; than the ones he had been making for ten years. Nevertheless, he ended his Universal contract with one last noir, the disappointing &quot;Deported&quot; (1951) which he filmed partly abroad (Siodmak was among the first refugee directors to return to Europe after making American films). The story is loosely based on the deportation of gangster Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano. Siodmak had hoped Loretta Young would star, but settled for the Swedish actress Märta Torén.

Those &quot;different type&quot; of films he had made—&quot;The Great Sinner&quot; (1949) for MGM, &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; (1947) for Universal (which Siodmak also produced), &quot;The Whistle at Eaton Falls&quot; (1951) for Columbia Pictures (Ernest Borgnine&#x27;s debut and Dorothy Gish&#x27;s return to the screen)—all proved ill-suited to his noir sensibilities (although in 1952 &quot;The Crimson Pirate&quot;, despite the difficult production, was a surprising and pleasing departure—in fact, Lancaster believed it was inspiration for the tongue-in-cheek style of the James Bond films).

The five months he collaborated with Budd Schulberg on a screenplay tentatively titled &quot;A Stone in the River Hudson&quot;, an early version of &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, was also a major disappointment for Siodmak. In 1954 he sued producer Sam Spiegel for copyright infringement. Siodmak was awarded $100,000, but no screen credit. His contribution to the original screenplay has never been acknowledged.

Siodmak&#x27;s return to Europe in 1954 with a Grand Prize nomination at the Cannes Film Festival for his remake of Jacques Feyder&#x27;s &quot;Le grand jeu&quot; was a misstep, despite its stars, Gina Lollobrigida (two of them) and Arletty in the role originated by Françoise Rosay, Feyder&#x27;s wife. In 1955, Siodmak returned to the Federal Republic of Germany to make &quot;Die Ratten&quot;, with Maria Schell and Curd Jurgens, winning the Golden Berlin Bear at the 1955 Berlin Film Festival. It was the first in a series of films critical of his homeland, during and after Hitler, which included &quot;Nachts, wenn der Teufel kam&quot;, both thriller and social artifact of Germany under Nazi rule, shot in documentary style reminiscent of &quot;Menschen am Sonntag&quot; and &quot;Whistle at Eaton Falls&quot;, and in 1960, &quot;Mein Schulfreund&quot;, an absurdist comedy, dark and strange, with Heinz Rühmann as a postal worker attempting to reunite with childhood friend Hermann Göring. In April 1958, Siodmak was made an executive in Kirk Douglas&#x27; film production company Bryna Productions, as European Representative.

Between these films, and &quot;Mein Vater, der Schauspieler&quot; in 1956, with O. W. Fischer (the West German Rock Hudson), he took a detour into Douglas Sirk territory with the sordid melodrama, &quot;Dorothea Angermann&quot; in 1959, featuring Germany&#x27;s star Ruth Leuwerik. Later the same year he left Germany for Great Britain to film &quot;The Rough and the Smooth&quot;, with Nadja Tiller and Tony Britton, yet another noir, but much meaner and gloomier than anything he had made in America (compare its downbeat ending with that of &quot;The File on Thelma Jordan&quot;). He followed with &quot;Katia&quot; also in 1959, a tale of Czarist Russia, with twenty-one-year-old Romy Schneider, mistakenly titled in America &quot;Magnificent Sinner&quot;, recalling—unfavorably—Siodmak&#x27;s other costume melodrama. In 1961, &quot;L&#x27;affaire Nina B&quot;, with Pierre Brasseur and Nadja Tiller (again), returned Siodmak to familiar ground in a slick, black-and-white thriller about a pay-for-hire Nazi hunter, which could be argued was the start of the many spy themed films so popular in the 1960s. In 1962, the entertaining &quot;Escape from East Berlin&quot;, with Don Murray and Christine Kaufman, had all the characteristic style of a Siodmak thriller, but was one that he later dismissed as something he had made for &quot;little kids in America.&quot; His work in Germany returned to programmers like those that had begun his career in Hollywood 23 years earlier. From 1964 to 1965, he made a series of films with former Tarzan Lex Barker: &quot;The Shoot&quot;, &quot;The Treasure of the Aztecs&quot;, and &quot;The Pyramid of the Sun God&quot;, all taken from the western, adventure novels of Karl May.

==Later career==
Siodmak&#x27;s return to Hollywood filmmaking in 1967 with the wide-screen western &quot;Custer of the West&quot; was another disappointment, receiving mostly negative reviews from critics and failing to generate box-office appeal. Siodmak ended his career with a six-hour, two-part toga and chariot epic, &quot;Kampf um Rom&quot; (1968), a more campy work (perhaps intentionally) than &quot;Cobra Woman&quot; had been. There was a brief and profitable foray into television in Great Britain with the series &quot;O.S.S.&quot; (1957–58). Siodmak was last seen publicly in an interview for Swiss television at his home in Ascona in 1971. He died alone in 1973 in Locarno of a heart attack, seven weeks after his wife&#x27;s death.

The British Film Institute held a retrospective of his career in April and May 2015.

<text>Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a first-person shooter video game developed by Gray Matter Studios and published by Activision. It was released on November 20, 2001 for Microsoft Windows and subsequently for PlayStation 2, Xbox, Linux, and Macintosh. The game serves as a reboot of the &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; series. id Software, the developers of &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, oversaw the development and were credited as executive producers. The multiplayer side eventually became the most popular part of the game, and was influential in the genre. Splash Damage created some of the maps for the Game of the Year edition. A sequel, titled &quot;Wolfenstein&quot;, was released in 2009.

==Gameplay==

The game is played from the first-person perspective, where the player&#x27;s task is to perform retrieval missions, sabotage or assassinations. Players can be armed with typical WW2 weaponry and can even use fictional weapons such as a German-made minigun or a Tesla gun. Players can also use stealth to eliminate enemies, with some missions strictly requiring for stealth to be used. Enemies vary from standard soldiers to undead and experimental creatures. Health is replenished by collecting health packs and food. Armor also can be collected for additional protection.

===Multiplayer===
Multiplayer is an objective-based game mode, in which players are split into two teams—Axis and Allies. Each team has a set of objectives to complete, the Allies usually being to destroy some sort of Axis objective, and the Axis objectives being to defend their objectives. These objectives are split into two categories, primary and secondary. Primary objectives are ones which must be completed for victory, generally stealing secret documents or destroying a radar array; however, secondary objectives are ones which are optional—they do not have to be completed, but if they are they may aid the appropriate team, such as blowing out a door to allow access into a tunnel which shortens travel time or allows less-noticeable infiltration of the enemy base.

Each team has access to a slightly different set of weapons, matching those used by each side in World War II. Players can choose from four different classes: Soldier, Medic, Engineer and Lieutenant. Soldiers can carry heavy weapons, such as the Panzerfaust, Venom Cannon or Flamethrower, which are not available to other classes. Medics can revive and heal other teammates. Engineers can breach obstacles and arm and defuse dynamite. Lieutenants can supply ammo to teammates and are able to call in air strikes.

Each class specializes in a certain aspect of the game, and an effective team will balance players out using all four classes, such as soldiers for blasting through enemy defenses, medics for supporting the team and keeping them alive, Lieutenants to resupply teammates with ammo, and engineers to complete the objective.

There are three different modes of play, each allowing for a different experience—objective, stopwatch, and checkpoint. Stopwatch calls for the Allied side to complete a set of objectives within a predefined time limit. The opposing team then become the Allies and have to complete the objectives in a shorter time than the now Axis. Checkpoint gamemode is a mode in which teams capture flags. It may be more commonly known as Capture the Flag (CTF). Whichever team is first to control all the flags at once, wins. The team-based networked multiplayer features different character classes that must work together in order to win. There are four classes — lieutenant, medic, engineer, and soldier — the soldier can be one of several subclasses depending upon the special/heavy weapon that he selects. The multiplayer demo includes a beachhead assault map similar to Omaha Beach.

==Plot==

In 1943, assigned to the Office of Secret Actions (OSA) from the military, US Army Ranger William &quot;B.J.&quot; Blazkowicz and British operative Agent One are sent to Egypt to investigate the activity of the German SS Paranormal Division. The duo find themselves witness to the SS releasing an ancient curse around the dig site, resurrecting scores of zombies from their slumber. Pushing through the mummies and Nazis, B.J. and Agent One are led to an airfield and a location to follow. As they tail the SS, the two are shot down near Austria and captured by the Nazis. Agent One and Blazkowicz are imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein, a remote, medieval castle that serves as a stronghold, prison, and research station. During their incarceration, Agent One is tortured for information and dies from electrocution. B.J., however, manages to escape Castle Wolfenstein&#x27;s dungeon and fights his way out of the castle, using a cable car to leave the area and meet up with Kessler, a member of the German resistance in a nearby village.

Meanwhile, the SS Paranormal Division, under Oberführer Helga von Bülow, has long since moved from Egypt and has been excavating the catacombs and crypts of an ancient church within the village itself in search of the resting place of a &quot;Dark Knight&quot;. The Division&#x27;s sloppy precautions have led to the release of an ancient curse and the awakening of hordes of undead creatures, this time including Saxon knights. The majority of the SS finally realize the dangers and seal off the entrance into the catacombs, leaving many soldiers trapped inside. B.J. descends regardless and fights both Nazis and undead until he arrives at the ancient house of worship, the Defiled Church, where Nazi scientist Professor Zemph is conducting a &#x27;life essence extraction&#x27; on the corpse of a Dark Knight, which, thanks to some Nazi technology, succeeds. Shortly before B.J.&#x27;s arrival, Zemph tries to talk the impatient Helga von Bulow out of retrieving an ancient Thulian artifact, the &quot;Dagger of Warding&quot; from a nearby altar in an isolated area of the church, but she shoots him and proceeds. This final blunder awakens another monster, Olaric, which kills and dismembers her. Blazkowicz, after a heated battle against spirits and demon attacks, defeats Olaric, and then is airlifted out with Zemph&#x27;s notes and the dagger.

With the lead on Helga seeming to have come to a close, the OSA begins to shift its focus to one of Germany&#x27;s leading scientific researchers and Head of the SS Special Projects Division, Oberführer Wilhelm &quot;Deathshead&quot; Strasse. Their investigation leads the OSA to realizing that Deathshead is preparing to launch an attack on London. He intends to use a V-2 rocket fitted with an experimental biological warhead, launching it from his base near Katamarunde in the Baltics. Due to the stealthy nature in which the OSA needs to act, Blazkowicz is parachuted some distance from the missile base and separated from his equipment. After collecting his gear, he smuggles himself into a supply truck bound for the base. Once inside, Blazkowicz destroys the V-2 on its launchpad and fights his way out of the facility towards an airbase filled with experimental jet aircraft. There, he commandeers a &quot;Kobra&quot; rocket-plane and flies to safety in Malta.

Eager to know more about Deathshead and his secret projects, the OSA sends Blazkowicz to the bombed-out city of Kugelstadt, where he is assisted by members of the German Kreisau Circle resistance group in breaking into a ruined factory and exfiltrating a defecting scientist. It is there he discovers the blueprints and prototype of the Reich&#x27;s latest weapon, an electrically operated hand-held minigun dubbed the Venom Gun. Blazkowicz eventually breaks into Deathshead&#x27;s underground research complex, the Secret Weapons Facility. There he encounters the horrific fruits of Deathshead&#x27;s labors: creatures, malformed, and twisted through surgery and mechanical implants. The creatures escape from their containments and go on a rampage. Blazkowicz fights his way through the facility, only to see Deathshead escape the chaos by U-boat, and learns of his destination by interrogating a captured German officer.

Blazkowicz is then parachuted into Norway, close to Deathshead&#x27;s mysterious &quot;X-Labs.&quot; After breaking into the facility, which has been overrun by the twisted creatures he encountered in Kugelstadt (dubbed &#x27;Lopers&#x27;), Blazkowicz retrieves Deathshead&#x27;s journal, which links Deathshead&#x27;s research to the rest of the SS Paranormal&#x27;s occult activity. Finally catching up with Deathshead, Blazkowicz comes face to face with a completed and fully armored &quot;Übersoldat&quot;, and kills the researchers who have developed it. After the &quot;Übersoldat&quot; is destroyed, Deathshead escapes in a Kobra rocket-plane and disappears for the rest of the game.

After studying the documents captured by Blazkowicz, the OSA has become aware of a scheme codenamed &#x27;Operation: Resurrection&#x27;, a plan to resurrect Heinrich I, a legendary and powerful Saxon warlock-king from 943 AD. Despite the skepticism of senior Allied commanders, the OSA parachutes Blazkowicz back near Castle Wolfenstein, at the Bramburg Dam, where he fights his way until he arrives at the village town of Paderborn. After assassinating all the senior officers of the SS Paranormal Division present there for the resurrection, Blazkowicz fights his way through Chateau Schufstaffel and into the grounds beyond. After fighting two more &quot;Übersoldaten&quot;, Blazkowicz enters an excavation site near Castle Wolfenstein.

Inside the excavation site, Blazkowicz fights Nazi guards and prototype &quot;Übersoldaten&quot;, and makes his way to a boarded-up entrance to Castle Wolfenstein&#x27;s underground crypts. There, he finds that the ruined and decaying sections of the castle has become infested with undead creatures, which are attacking the castle&#x27;s garrison. After fighting his way through the underworkings of the castle, Blazkowicz arrives too late at the site of a dark ceremony to prevent the resurrection of Heinrich I. At the ceremony, SS psychic and &quot;Oberführerin&quot; Marianna Blavatsky conjure up dark spirits, which transform three of Deathshead&#x27;s &quot;Übersoldaten&quot; into Dark Knights, Heinrich&#x27;s lieutenants. She ultimately raises Heinrich I, who turns her into his undead slave. Blazkowicz destroys the three Dark Knights, the undead Marianna Blavatsky, and eventually Heinrich I. In the distance, &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler remarks how matters have been ruined as he leaves for Berlin to face an expectant Hitler.

Back in the OSA, Operation Resurrection is closed and Blazkowicz is off on some &quot;R&amp;R&quot; — shooting Nazis.

==Development==
The game was announced in January 2000. &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; includes a story-based single-player campaign, as well as a team-based networked multiplayer mode.

In the campaign, Allied agents from the fictional &quot;Office of Secret Actions&quot; (OSA) are sent to investigate rumors surrounding one of Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s personal projects, the SS Paranormal Division (also see Ahnenerbe). The agents are, however, captured before completing their mission and are imprisoned in Castle Wolfenstein. Taking the role of Blazkowicz, the player must escape the castle. The player soon investigates the activities of the SS Paranormal Division, which include research on resurrecting corpses and biotechnology, while also sabotaging weapons of mass destruction such as V-2 rockets and biological warheads. During the game the player battles Waffen SS soldiers, elite &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; (paratroopers) known as Black Guards, undead creatures, and &quot;Übersoldaten&quot; (supersoldiers) formed from a blend of surgery and chemical engineering conducted by Wilhelm &quot;Deathshead&quot; Strasse. The end boss is an undead Saxon warrior-prince named Heinrich I.

The cable car in the castle is based on the 1968 movie &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;, where a U.S. Army Brigadier General is captured and taken prisoner to the &quot;Schloß Adler&quot;, a fortress high in the Alps above the town of Werfen, reachable only by cable car, and the headquarters of the German Secret Service in southern Bavaria. The supernatural element is based on the story of Castle Wewelsburg, a 17th-century castle occupied by the Germans under Heinrich Himmler&#x27;s control, and used for occult rituals and practices.

One of the multiplayer maps (also released individually as the multiplayer demo) depicts Omaha Beach in Operation Overlord, and is inspired by the opening scene of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. This put &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; in competition with another id Tech 3-powered World War II-themed first person shooter, &quot;Medal of Honor: Allied Assault&quot; which also features its own take on Omaha Beach.

In the German version of the game, it avoids making direct reference to Nazi Party and the &quot;Third Reich&quot;, in order to comply with strict laws in Germany. The player is not battling Nazis but a secret sect called the &quot;Wolves&quot; led by Heinrich Höller, whose name is a pun of the original character Himmler (Himmler roughly translates as &quot;&quot;Heaven&quot;er&quot;, Höller as &quot;&quot;Hell&quot;er&quot;). The Nazi swastika is also not present: the German forces use a Wolfenstein logo which is a combination of a stylized double-headed eagle prominent in most Nazi symbolism, a &quot;W&quot; (standing for Wolfenstein), and the &quot;Quake III: Team Arena&quot; &quot;QIII&quot; logo (the game engine and network code that &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; is based upon). The &quot;W&quot; eagle logo is prominently seen on the cover art for the American version.

Music pieces such as Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Sonata&quot; and &quot;Für Elise&quot; are used in the single-player campaign.

Some sound effects in the game are excerpts heard in the 1968 movie &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. A radar station and the X-Labs levels of the game feature these sounds prominently to give the effect of working scientific equipment at a research facility.

The game is powered by a modified version of the id Tech 3 engine, with changes made to support large outdoor areas. The &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; engine was subsequently used as the foundation for &quot;&quot; (Splash Damage/Activision), &quot;Trinity: The Shatter Effect&quot; (Gray Matter Studios/Activision) (shown at E3 in 2003, but assumed cancelled) and &quot;Call of Duty&quot; (Infinity Ward/Activision).

There are many different releases of &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot;. The original release, version 1.0, came in a game box featuring a book-like flap. A Collector&#x27;s Edition, packaged in a metal case, was released at the same time. The contents of the Collector&#x27;s Edition changed depending on when it was purchased and could include a poster and fabric patch, a poster and a bonus CD, or just the bonus CD. The Game of the Year Edition (2002 - v.1.33) came with the original &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, game demos, and seven new multiplayer maps (Trenchtoast, Tram Siege, Ice, Chateau, Keep, The Damned, and Rocket.) The Platinum Edition (2004 - v.1.41) included &quot;&quot;, a stand-alone multiplayer expansion, and &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;. &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War&quot; also came with the original &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; as an unlockable after beating the campaign, and included some enhancements like surround sound.

===Ports===
The game was released for Linux and Macintosh platforms in 2002, with the Linux port done in-house by Timothee Besset and the Mac port done by Aspyr Media. In 2003, the game was ported to the PlayStation 2 and Xbox video game consoles and subtitled as &quot;Operation Resurrection&quot; and &quot;Tides of War&quot;, respectively.

====Console version differences====
Both console versions include an additional single-player prequel mission, set in the fictional town of Ras El-Hadid in Egypt. The latter half of the level features an extensive underground burial site with many undead enemies, as does the original first mission. This prequel level is likely closer to the developers&#x27; true intentions for the story, as indicated by the distinctly Egyptian design of the burial site, including the presence of sand, traps, mummies and hieroglyphs on the walls in some areas (in the original storyline, this site is found in the middle of a German village during the second mission). By contrast, the single-player storyline in the Windows version starts at Castle Wolfenstein.

The PS2 version has a bonus feature which allows players to purchase items at the end of each level by finding secrets. In the Xbox version, a Secret Bonus is awarded after every level when all the secret areas for that level have been found. It also has several new equipable items and weapons as well as new enemies. The two-player co-op mode is exclusive to Xbox and allows the second player to play as Agent One, altering the game in which he was never killed and played out the missions to the end. This allows for the story to support that Agent One either survived. The Xbox version also has downloadable content, system-link play and had online multiplayer via Xbox Live before it was disabled for original Xbox games. A Platinum Hits edition of the game was also released for the Xbox. The PlayStation 2 version does not support online multiplayer.

Completing the Xbox version unlocks a further bonus: the original &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;.

===Source code release===
The source code for &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; and &quot;Enemy Territory&quot; was released under the GNU General Public License v3.0 or later on August 12, 2010. The &quot;ioquake3&quot; developers at icculus.org announced the start of respective engine projects soon after.

=== Community mods ===
On October 15, 2020, a community overhaul mod &quot;RealRTCW&quot; was released on Steam as a free modification for original game. It features new renderer, expanded arsenal, rebalanced gunplay, new high-quality models, textures and sounds.

On November 19, 2021, day of the game&#x27;s twentieth anniversary, free modification &quot;Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Single-Player &amp; Cooperative&quot; was released on Steam by French modder William Faure, head of a small team of developers at &quot;Dark Matter Productions&quot; since 2013 who was also involved in the development of &quot;RealRTCW&quot;, restoring the single-player campaign of the cancelled &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory&quot; expansion with approval and external support from original game developers.

==Film==
A &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; film was announced in 2002 with Rob Cohen attached to direct. Little information has been available since, however, with the exception of a July 20, 2005 IGN interview. The interview discussed the &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; film with id employees. In the interview, Todd Hollenshead indicated that the movie was in the works, though still in the early stages.

On August 3, 2007, &quot;Variety&quot; confirmed &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot;, to be written and directed by Roger Avary and produced by Samuel Hadida. On November 2, 2012, Roger Avary signed on to write and direct the film. The film is being described as a mix of &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; and &quot;Captain America&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; received favorable reviews from critics. At Metacritic, it scores 88/100 (based on 32 reviews), and on GameRankings it scores 87% (based on 50 reviews). &quot;Eurogamer&quot; Tom Bramwell called &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; &quot;a worthy addition to the stable of id Software affiliated shoot &#x27;em ups. The single-player game is average to good and takes quite a while to finish, but the game really earns its salt by shipping with a first class multiplayer element.&quot;

AllGame editor Christopher Allen gave the game a positive review, drawing comparisons to &quot;Half-Life&quot;.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; named &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein: Tides of War&quot; the best Xbox game of May 2003.

===Sales===
&quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; debuted at #3 on NPD Intelect&#x27;s computer game sales chart for the November 18–24 period, at an average retail price of $57. It fell to position 7 in its second week. By the end of 2001, the game&#x27;s domestic sales totaled 253,852 units, for revenues of $13.1 million (~$ in ).

In the United States, &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; sold 350,000 copies and earned $17 million (~$ in ) by August 2006. It was the country&#x27;s 48th-best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. Combined sales of all &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; computer games released between January 2000 and August 2006 had reached 660,000 units in the United States by the latter date. &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom. By January 2002, Activision reported that shipments of &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; to retailers had surpassed one million units. The game sold 2 million copies by January 2004.

===Awards===

&quot;PC Gamer US&quot; awarded &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; its 2001 &quot;Best Multiplayer Game&quot; prize. The editors wrote: &quot;No other FPS rewards this level of teamplay, sports this kind of graphics, or is this blissfully free of cheaters.&quot;

==Sequels==
A multiplayer-only spinoff of the series, &quot;&quot;, was originally planned as a full-fledged expansion pack for &quot;Return to Castle Wolfenstein&quot; developed by Splash Damage. The single-player component of the game was never completed and thus was removed entirely. The developers at that point decided the multiplayer part would be released as a free, downloadable standalone game. &quot;Enemy Territory&quot; is a team-based networked multiplayer game which involves completing objectives through teamwork using various character classes.

This gameplay was later reutilized in a full-fledged commercial game &quot;Enemy Territory: Quake Wars&quot; set in id Software&#x27;s &quot;Quake&quot; universe. A semi-sequel called &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; was developed by Raven Software and id Software and published by Activision, and released on August 18, 2009. A successor to &quot;Wolfenstein&quot; titled &quot;&quot; and a standalone prequel expansion titled &quot;&quot; have also been released in 2014 and 2015. The Old Blood references RTCW with characters with similar names and the X-labs being mentioned.

&quot;The New Order&quot; storyline was followed up in &quot;Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus&quot; which was released in late 2017.

<text>Red Faction is a first-person shooter video game developed by Volition and published by THQ for PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows in 2001, and Macintosh platforms in 2001 and 2002. A version for the N-Gage was developed by Monkeystone Games, and the mobile version was developed by Blue Beck. The game was inspired by several works of contemporary science fiction.

&quot;Red Faction&quot; takes place on Mars in the late 21st century. The player controls a miner named Parker who helps lead a rebellion against the Ultor Corporation. The premiere feature of the game is its &quot;Geo-Mod&quot; technology, short for &quot;geometry modification&quot;, which provided destructible environments, allowing the player to destroy certain sections of the scenery in the game. For example, instead of opening a door, a player could blast through the rock surrounding the door. The game sold more than 1 million units by 2002.

On November 29, 2016, the game was made available for the PlayStation 4 through the PlayStation Network with added features such as trophy support and widescreen resolutions.

==Gameplay==
The game features GeoMod technology, which allows players to significantly alter and otherwise affect the surrounding terrain and buildings, either with explosives or otherwise. Past games had allowed limited alteration of the environment through scripted means, or special triggered areas which would add or remove certain predefined level elements. &quot;Red Faction&quot; was the first video game that allowed players unscripted level-altering possibilities.

The PC version of &quot;Red Faction&quot; includes an extra level called &quot;Glass House&quot; which allows the player to experiment with GeoMod as a mechanic in a sandbox environment.

The PlayStation 2 version uses offline split-screen multiplayer featuring deathmatch rounds with AI bots and up to 4 human players. The PC release of the game, in addition to its offline LAN mode, has competitive online multiplayer featuring deathmatch, team deathmatch, and capture the flag gameplay for up to 32 human players on 25 different levels. 2 additional multiplayer levels for the PC version were each included as exclusive content for players who purchased the game from either GameStop or Electronics Boutique. The later PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 releases are direct ports of the PlayStation 2 version and include no multiplayer functionality.

==Plot==
&quot;Red Faction&quot; takes place on Mars around the year 2075. Earth&#x27;s minerals are being depleted and humans need more of them to survive. The vast Ultor Corporation runs the mining operation on Mars. The living conditions are deplorable, human rights for the miners are few, and a disease called &quot;The Plague&quot; is running rampant throughout the colony with no known antidote available—predominantly within the confines of the mine complex. Parker, a downtrodden miner, came to Mars to make a new start in his life—taken in by the promises and advantages Ultor has to offer in the mines of Mars. After a routine day in the mine with the typical aggression toward miners and cramped living conditions and poor nutrition, he witnesses the spark that starts a rebellion when a security guard abuses a miner at the end of his shift and attempts to attack him, causing the miner to fight back and kill the security guard. Parker takes up arms, with the help of Hendrix, a rebellious Ultor security technician who guides Parker through the complex. Hendrix tries to get Parker to join up with a group of miners who are about to steal a supply shuttle and escape the complex, but Parker arrives too late. The shuttle takes off, and is destroyed by missiles moments later.

Parker traverses through the Ultor complex, eliminating any resistance Ultor throws at him, and even (with the help of Orion, a high-ranking Red Faction member) kidnapping a high-ranking Ultor administrator, Gryphon, for Eos, leader of the Red Faction. Parker learns from Gryphon about Dr. Capek, who created &quot;The Plague&quot;. Capek has been experimenting with nanotechnology, and the Plague is a side-effect of injections at the miners&#x27; annual medical checkup. Hendrix directs Parker to Capek&#x27;s secret underground laboratory, where he and Eos meet up and take down Capek. As Capek dies, he tells Eos there is a cure for the Plague but refuses to tell her how to make it and dies. With Capek dead, the lab&#x27;s self-destruction sequence initiates. Eos stays behind to find the files on the cure while Parker continues to the Communications center. After sending a distress call to the Earth Defense Force, Parker destroys the missile defense system, so that he can stow away on a shuttle to an Ultor space station in Martian orbit to deactivate a laser defense system without getting shot down.

After destroying the space station, Parker lands back on Mars via an escape pod, Ultor brings out its reserve of mercenaries to help them in their fight against the miners. Hendrix tells Parker that the mercenaries have orders to destroy the mining complex, covering up any proof of Ultor&#x27;s wrongdoing, Hendrix is killed soon after this by the mercenaries. After fighting his way through the mercenary base, Parker confronts Masako, the mercenary leader. After he kills Masako, Parker sees that Eos is tied up and sitting on the floor next to the bomb, which has been set to explode. After deactivating it, the Earth Defense Force arrives just in time to save Parker and Eos from a fighter aircraft. Eos tells Parker that an antidote for the Plague has been made and it is being given to any sick miners. She also tells him she is leaving Mars, and that Parker should enjoy his new status as a hero.

==Development==
&quot;Descent 4&quot; was a game being developed by Volition as part of the &quot;Descent&quot; game franchise, as a prequel to &quot;Descent&quot;. However, it was cancelled and the technology behind it and some of the plot were incorporated into &quot;Red Faction&quot;. Examples include the main character Parker as well as the GeoMod engine.

Similarities between &quot;Red Faction&quot; and the 1990 film &quot;Total Recall&quot; have been pointed out, with its setting on Mars and the rebellion against the guards. Lead designer Alan Lawrance acknowledged the similarities in a 2014 interview but stated the film was not used as the main inspiration; any connection is purely coincidental.

&quot;Red Faction&quot; entered a pre-production phase in 1998. The original intention was for every part of the game to be destructible but this was reduced in scope due to technical challenges and the requirement to guide the player through a linear game. It was created by a small team on a relatively limited budget, and released in 2001.

The N-Gage version was developed by John Romero&#x27;s studio Monkeystone Games.

==Reception==
The PlayStation 2 and PC versions of &quot;Red Faction&quot; received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;, while the N-Gage version received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

For the PlayStation 2 version, &quot;IGN&quot; called it &quot;an absolute must-have game for the PlayStation 2, and it&#x27;s the best single-player first-person shooter by a long shot&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; stated, &quot;Although &quot;Red Faction&quot; rarely outstrips the games it draws inspiration from, the fact that there are times when it shows them up at all is pretty impressive.&quot; &quot;PlanetPS2&quot; commented, &quot;&quot;Red Faction&quot; delivers a satisfying, if slightly flawed single player experience and a distracting, but ultimately shallow multiplayer mode. The graphics are impressive, and the technology introduced in this game is amazing, it&#x27;s just unfortunate that it hasn&#x27;t been used to its fullest potential.&quot; Chester &quot;Chet&quot; Barber of &quot;NextGen&quot; said in its July 2001 issue, &quot;Although &quot;Red Faction&quot; isn&#x27;t the most inventive FPS out there, it proves to be worthy with a solid single-player mode.&quot; Jason D&#x27;Aprile of &quot;Extended Play&quot; gave it four stars out of five, saying, &quot;To say &quot;Red Faction&quot; is the best shooter on the PS2 doesn&#x27;t do it justice -- it&#x27;s one of the best shooters available for any system, and easily one of the best games on the PlayStation2. Mixing tried, true, and blisteringly entertaining action with superb AI, innovative game design elements, and a constantly moving storyline to drive this long and challenging shooter forward, &quot;Red Faction&quot; manages to shoot a breath of fresh air into the whole genre. If you love great action, go out and get this game.&quot; However, &quot;Edge&quot; gave it the lowest score of five out of ten. Uncle Dust of &quot;GamePro&quot; said, &quot;&quot;Red Faction&quot; hits the mark, combining superior technology and awesome graphics with an intense, lengthy, and satisfying story line to keep gamers fighting for the rebellion with all they&#x27;ve got.&quot;

For the PC version, &quot;IGN&quot; stated, &quot;It&#x27;s all about the gameplay, and when you crank this baby to hard or, God forbid, im-freaking-possible, you&#x27;ll find the gameplay to keep you going for hours piled upon days, piled upon weeks.&quot; &quot;PC Gamer&quot; commented, &quot;As far as looks go, &quot;Red Faction&quot; is more like the cute girl next door than a hot fashion model from the Upper West Side: It&#x27;s pretty, but it won&#x27;t make a man drop to his knees and thank God for giving him sight.&quot; &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted, &quot;Its relative lack of originality can ... undermine &quot;Red Faction&quot;&#x27;s appeal for more-experienced players, for whom the game will provide mostly familiar territory. Nevertheless, &quot;Red Faction&quot; is an accomplished shooter in its own right.&quot; &quot;GameRevolution&quot; called the game &quot;a fine FPS with plenty of action and intense gameplay, even if it is derivative, too short and a tad uninspired.&quot; However, Jeff Lundrigan of &quot;NextGen&quot; said in its December 2001 issue, &quot;&quot;Red Faction&quot; on PC is well worth playing for its engaging storyline and varied gameplay, but as a PC title, it&#x27;s enjoyable without being especially notable.&quot; Steve Bauman of &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; gave it three stars out of five, saying, &quot;It has the setup, but its drab, by-the-numbers execution lacks any flair.&quot;

&quot;Maxim&quot; gave the PS2 version all five stars and said, &quot;We have to admit that most first-person games nauseate us, but [&quot;Red Faction&quot;]&#x27;s smooth graphics and easy gameplay make it hard to put down.&quot; &quot;Playboy&quot; gave the same console version a score of 90% and stated, &quot;Virtually every element of &quot;Red Faction&quot; is nicely polished – even the controls are intuitive, unlike most console shooters, which make PC gaming vets long for a keyboard and mouse.&quot; &quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; gave the N-Gage version four stars out of five and called it &quot;a clever port from the popular console and PC versions&quot;. Star Dingo of &quot;GamePro&quot;, however, said of the same N-Gage version, &quot;To be honest, the levels (small and right-angle-filled as they are) are fairly well-balanced in terms of weapon and enemy placement; the music generates atmosphere; and there are good vocal and audio cues. But first-person shooters weren&#x27;t a good idea on the Game Boy Advance. Turns out they&#x27;re not really the best idea on a cell phone, either.&quot;

The PC version was nominated at &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s 2001 Blister Awards for &quot;Most Artistic PC Game&quot;, but lost to &quot;Myst III: Exile&quot;.

==Sequels==
The sequel, &quot;Red Faction II&quot;, was released for PlayStation 2 in October 2002, then GameCube, Xbox and Microsoft Windows the following year. It takes place on Earth and tells the story of a group of supersoldiers, including the main character, who are physically enhanced by the nanotechnology originally developed by Capek on Mars.

On June 15, 2009, THQ released &quot;Red Faction: Guerrilla&quot;, for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows. In this iteration, the story again takes place on Mars, where the Earth Defense Force has become as tyrannical an organization as Ultor.

Developed by Locomotive Games, a spin-off of the &quot;Red Faction&quot; games called &quot;Red Faction: B.E.A.S.T.&quot; was in a pre-alpha development stage for the Nintendo Wii video game console. However, with the closure of Locomotive Games the game has been abandoned, although several models and a full-length trailer were released to the public upon the closure of the studio.

On June 4, 2010, the next installment was announced with the trailer for &quot;Red Faction: Armageddon&quot;. The story occurs approximately 50 years after the events of &quot;Red Faction: Guerrilla&quot;. Players assume the role of Darius Mason, grandson of Alec and Samanya from the last installment of the series. In &quot;Armageddon&quot;, the Martian colonists now reside underground following the destruction of the machine responsible for terraforming Mars. Years after this event, creatures encountered in the first game are again released. &quot;Red Faction: Armageddon&quot; was released on June 7, 2011.

<text>Ragnar Anton Kittil Frisch (3 March 1895 – 31 January 1973) was an influential Norwegian economist known for being one of the major contributors to establishing economics as a quantitative and statistically informed science in the early 20th century. He coined the term econometrics in 1926 for utilising statistical methods to describe economic systems, as well as the terms microeconomics and macroeconomics in 1933, for describing individual and aggregate economic systems, respectively. He was the first to develop a statistically informed model of business cycles in 1933. Later work on the model, together with Jan Tinbergen, won the first Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1969.

Frisch became dr.philos. with a thesis on mathematics and statistics at the University of Oslo in 1926&quot;.&quot; After his doctoral thesis, he spent five years researching in the United States at the University of Minnesota and Yale University. After teaching briefly at Yale from 1930–31, he was offered a full professorship in economics, which he declined after pressures by colleagues to return to the University of Oslo. After returning to Oslo, Frisch was first appointed by the King-in-Council as Professor of Economics and Statistics at the Faculty of Law, University of Oslo (then the &quot;Royal Frederick University&quot;) in 1931, before becoming leader of the newly founded Institute of Economics at the University of Oslo in 1932. He remained at the University of Oslo until his retirement in 1965.

Frisch was one of the founders of the Econometric Society in 1930, and edited the journal &quot;Econometrica&quot; for its first 21 years. He has given name to the Frisch Medal, which is awarded every year by the Econometric Society for the best paper in econometrics published in the last five years, as well as the Frisch-centre for Applied Economic Analysis at the University of Oslo. The Grand Auditorium at the Institute of Economics, University of Oslo also bears his name.

== Background and education ==

===Family and early years===

Ragnar Frisch was born on 3 March 1895 in Christiania as the son of gold- and silversmith Anton Frisch and Ragna Fredrikke Frisch (née Kittilsen). The Frisch family had emigrated from Germany to Kongsberg in Norway in the 17th century and his ancestors had worked for the Kongsberg Silver Mines for generations; Ragnar&#x27;s grandfather Antonius Frisch had become a goldsmith in Christiania in 1856. His family had thus worked with precious metals like silver and gold for at least 300 years.

Being expected to continue his family business, Frisch became an apprentice in the David Andersen workshop in Oslo. However at his mother&#x27;s advice, while doing his apprenticeship Frisch also started studying at the Royal Frederick University. His chosen topic was economics, as it seemed to be &quot;the shortest and easiest study&quot; available at the university, and passed his degree in 1919. In 1920 he also passed his handicraftsman tests and became a partner in his father&#x27;s workshop.

===Early career and further education===
In 1921 Frisch received a fellowship from the university which enabled him to spend three years studying economics and mathematics in France and England. After his return to Norway, in 1923, although the family&#x27;s business was having difficulties, he continued his scientific activity, believing that research, not jewellery, was his real calling. He published a few papers about probability theory, started teaching at the University of Oslo during 1925 and, in 1926, he obtained the Dr. Philos. degree with a thesis in mathematical statistics.

Also in 1926, Frisch published an article outlining his view that economics should follow the same path towards theoretical and empirical quantization that other sciences, especially physics, had followed. During the same year, he published his seminal article &quot;Sur un problème d&#x27;économie pure&quot; starting the implementation of his own quantization programme. The article offered theoretical axiomatizations which result in a precise specification of both ordinal and cardinal utility, followed by an empirical estimation of the cardinal specification. Frisch also started lecturing a course on production theory, introducing a mathematization of the subject.

Frisch received a fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation to visit the United States in 1927. There, seeking other economists interested in the new mathematical and statistical approaches to economics, he associated with Irving Fisher, Wesley Clair Mitchell, Allyn Young and Henry Schultz. He wrote a paper analyzing the role of investment in explaining economic fluctuations. Wesley Mitchell, who had just written a book on business cycles, popularized Frisch&#x27;s paper which was introducing new advanced methods.

===Later career===
Although his fellowship was extended to travel to Italy and France, the next year Frisch had to return to Norway because of his father&#x27;s death. He spent one year to modernize and recapitalize his family&#x27;s workshop by selling family assets and to find a jeweller to manage the business for him. Then he resumed academic work, in 1928 being appointed Associate Professor of statistics and economics at the Oslo University. During 1927 and 1928 Frisch published a series of articles on the statistics of time series. In 1929 he published his first important essay on econometric methodology, &quot;Correlation and scatter in statistical variables&quot;, followed in the same year by &quot;Statics and dynamics in economic theory&quot;, which introduced dynamics in economic analysis.

Frisch became a full Professor at the university in 1931. He also founded at the university the Rockefeller-funded Institute of Economics in 1932 and became its Director of Research.

Ragnar Frisch received the Antonio Feltrinelli prize from the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in 1961 and the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1969 (awarded jointly with Jan Tinbergen) for &quot;having developed and applied dynamic models for the analysis of economic processes&quot;. He was a member of both the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society.

During the occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany, Frisch was arrested, along with 13 other University of Oslo faculty members and more than 100 students, in October 1943. He was imprisoned in Bredtveit concentration camp from 17 October 1943, then in Berg concentration camp from 22 November 1943, then in Grini detention camp from 9 December 1943 to 8 October 1944.

===Family===
Frisch married Marie Smedal in 1920 and they had a daughter, Ragna (b. 1938). His granddaughter, Nadia Hasnaoui (Ragna&#x27;s child), became a Norwegian television performer. After his first wife died in 1952, he remarried in 1953 with childhood friend Astrid Johannessen. who died in 1980.

==Work==
Frisch was one of the founders of economics as a modern science. He made a number of significant advances in the field of economics and coined a number of new words including econometrics and macroeconomics. His 1926 paper on consumer theory helped set up Neo-Walrasian research. He formalized production theory, especially in addressing nonallocable inputs leading to jointness, meaning less than full control, in production processes (see esp. Chapters 14 and 15).

In econometrics he worked on time series (1927) and linear regression analysis (1934). With Frederick V. Waugh, he introduced the celebrated Frisch–Waugh theorem (&quot;Econometrica&quot; 1933) (sometimes referred to as the Frisch–Waugh–Lovell theorem). In oligopoly theory he developed the conjectural variation approach. Frisch also is credited with introducing the term &quot;model&quot; in its modern economic sense by Paul Samuelson, based on a 1930 Yale University lecture.

His 1933 work on impulse-propagation business cycles became one of the principles of modern New Classical business cycle theory. He also helped introduce econometric modeling to government economic planning and accounting.

He was one of the founders of the Econometric Society and editor of &quot;Econometrica&quot; for over twenty years. The Frisch Medal, so named in his honor, is given every two years for the best paper published in the aforementioned &quot;Econometrica&quot; in the previous five years.

Frisch&#x27;s most important hobby was bee-keeping, for which Frisch performed genetic studies.

<doc id="26572" wikidata="Q326900" url="?curid=26572" title="Rennet">
<text>Rennet () is a complex set of enzymes produced in the stomachs of ruminant mammals. Chymosin, its key component, is a protease enzyme that curdles the casein in milk. In addition to chymosin, rennet contains other enzymes, such as pepsin and a lipase.

Rennet has traditionally been used to separate milk into solid curds and liquid whey, used in the production of cheeses. Rennet from calves has become less common for this use, to the point that less than 5% of cheese in the United States is made using animal rennet today. Most cheese is now made using chymosin derived from bacterial sources.

==Molecular action of rennet enzymes==
One of the main actions of rennet is its protease chymosin cleaving the kappa casein chain. Casein is the main protein of milk. Cleavage removes the slightly negatively charged glycomacropeptide (GMP) from the surface of the casein micelle. Because negative charges repel other negative charges, the GMP prevents casein micelles from adhering to each other. With the GMP removed, the casein micelles can begin to cluster and lose their polar charge, causing them to rise out of the polar water molecules and join non-polar milk fat as a portion of the cheese curd. This action is enhanced in the presence of strong ions like those formed from calcium and phosphate. As such, those chemicals are occasionally added to supplement pre-existing quantities in the cheese making process, especially in calcium phosphate-poor goat milk. The solid truncated casein protein network traps other components of milk, such as fats and minerals, to create cheese.

==Extraction of calf rennet==
Calf rennet is extracted from the inner mucosa of the fourth stomach chamber (the abomasum) of young, nursing calves as part of livestock butchering. These stomachs are a byproduct of veal production. Rennet extracted from older calves (grass-fed or grain-fed) contains less or no chymosin, but a high level of pepsin and can only be used for special types of milk and cheeses. As each ruminant produces a special kind of rennet to digest the milk of its own species, milk-specific rennets are available, such as kid goat rennet for goat&#x27;s milk and lamb rennet for sheep&#x27;s milk.

=== Traditional method ===
Dried and cleaned stomachs of young calves are sliced into small pieces and then put into salt water or whey, together with some vinegar or wine to lower the pH of the solution. After some time (overnight or several days), the solution is filtered. The crude rennet that remains in the filtered solution can then be used to coagulate milk. About 1 gram of this solution can normally coagulate 2 to 4 litres of milk.

=== Modern method ===
Deep-frozen stomachs are milled and put into an enzyme-extracting solution. The crude rennet extract is then activated by adding acid; the enzymes in the stomach are produced in an inactive form and are activated by the stomach acid. The acid is then neutralized and the rennet extract is filtered in several stages and concentrated until reaching a typical potency of about 1:15,000; meaning 1 g of extract can coagulate 15 kg of milk.

One kilogram of rennet extract has about 0.7 g of active enzymes – the rest is water and salt and sometimes sodium benzoate (E211),
0.5%–1.0% for preservation. Typically, 1 kg of cheese contains about 0.0003 g of rennet enzymes.

==Alternative sources==
Because of the limited availability of mammalian stomachs for rennet production, cheese makers have sought other ways to coagulate milk since at least Roman times. The many sources of enzymes that can be a substitute for animal rennet range from plants and fungi to microbial sources. Cheeses produced from any of these varieties of rennet are suitable for lactovegetarians, as well as those keeping Kosher. Fermentation-produced chymosin is used more often in industrial cheesemaking in North America and Europe today because it is less expensive than animal rennet.

=== Vegetable ===

Many plants have coagulating properties. Homer suggests in the &quot;Iliad&quot; that the Greeks used an extract of fig juice to coagulate milk. Other examples include several species of Galium, dried caper leaves, nettles, thistles, mallow, &quot;Withania coagulans&quot; (also known as Paneer Booti, Ashwagandh and the Indian Cheesemaker), and ground ivy. Some traditional cheese production in the Mediterranean uses enzymes from thistle or &quot;Cynara&quot; (artichokes and cardoons). Phytic acid, derived from unfermented soybeans, or fermentation-produced chymosin (FPC) may also be used.

Vegetable rennet might be used in the production of kosher and halal cheeses, but nearly all kosher cheeses are produced with either microbial rennet or FPC. Commercial so-called vegetable rennets usually contain an extract from the mold &quot;Rhizomucor miehei&quot; described below.

=== Microbial ===
Some molds such as &quot;Rhizomucor miehei&quot; are able to produce proteolytic enzymes. These molds are produced in a fermenter and then specially concentrated and purified to avoid contamination with unpleasant byproducts of the mold growth.

The traditional view is that these coagulants result in bitterness and low yield in cheese, especially when aged for a long time. Over the years, microbial coagulants have improved greatly, largely due to the characterization and purification of secondary enzymes responsible for bitter peptide formation/non-specific proteolytic breakdown in cheese aged for long periods. Consequently, it has become possible to produce several high-quality cheeses with microbial rennet.

It is also suitable for the elaboration of vegan cheese, provided no animal-based ingredients are used in its production.

=== Fermentation-produced chymosin===

Because of the above imperfections of microbial and animal rennets, many producers sought other replacements of rennet. With genetic engineering it became possible to isolate rennet genes from animals and introduce them into certain bacteria, fungi, or yeasts to make them produce recombinant chymosin during fermentation. The genetically modified microorganism is killed after fermentation and chymosin isolated from the fermentation broth, so that the fermentation-produced chymosin (FPC) used by cheese producers does not contain a GMO or any GMO DNA. FPC is identical to chymosin made by an animal, but is produced in a more efficient way. FPC products have been on the market since 1990 and, because the quantity needed per unit of milk can be standardized, are commercially viable alternatives to crude animal or plant rennets, as well as generally preferred to them in industrial production.

Originally created by biotechnology company Pfizer, FPC was the first artificially-produced enzyme to be registered and allowed by the US Food and Drug Administration. In 1999, about 60% of US hard cheeses were made with FPC, and it has up to 80% of the global market share for rennet. By 2017, FPC takes up 90% of the global market share for rennet.

The most widely used FPC is produced either by the fungus &quot;Aspergillus niger&quot; and commercialized under the trademark CHY-MAX by the Danish company Chr. Hansen, or produced by &quot;Kluyveromyces lactis&quot; and commercialized under the trademark Maxiren by the Dutch company DSM.

FPC is chymosin B, so it is purer than animal rennet, which contains a multitude of proteins. FPC provides several benefits to the cheese producer compared with animal or microbial rennet: higher production yield, better curd texture, and reduced bitterness.

Cheeses produced with FPC can be certified kosher and halal, and are suitable for vegetarians if no animal-based alimentation was used during the chymosin production in the fermenter.

== Nonrennet coagulation ==

Many soft cheeses are produced without use of rennet, by coagulating milk with acid, such as citric acid or vinegar, or the lactic acid produced by soured milk. Cream cheese, paneer, rubing, and other acid-set cheeses are traditionally made this way.
The acidification can also come from bacterial fermentation such as in cultured milk.

Vegan alternatives to cheese are manufactured without using animal milk but instead use soy, wheat, rice or cashew. These can be coagulated with acid using sources such as vinegar or lemon juice.

== In mythology ==
In Yazidism, the Earth is believed to have coagulated and formed when rennet flowed from the White Spring of the celestial Lalish in heaven into the Primeval Ocean.

<text>Rabbits are small mammals in the family Leporidae (which also includes the hares), which is in the order Lagomorpha (which also includes pikas). They are familiar throughout the world as a small herbivore, a prey animal, a domesticated form of livestock, and a pet, having a widespread effect on ecologies and cultures. The most widespread rabbit genera are &quot;Oryctolagus&quot; and &quot;Sylvilagus&quot;. The former, &quot;Oryctolagus&quot;, includes the European rabbit, &quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;, which is the ancestor of the hundreds of breeds of domestic rabbit and has been introduced on every continent except Antarctica. The latter, &quot;Sylvilagus&quot;, includes over 13 wild rabbit species, among them the cottontails and tapetis. Wild rabbits not included in &quot;Oryctolagus&quot; and &quot;Sylvilagus&quot; include several species of limited distribution, including the pygmy rabbit, volcano rabbit, and Sumatran striped rabbit.

Rabbits are a paraphyletic grouping, and do not constitute a clade, as hares (belonging to the genus &quot;Lepus&quot;) are nested within the Leporidae clade and are not described as rabbits. Although once considered rodents, lagomorphs diverged earlier and have a number of traits rodents lack, including two extra incisors. Similarities between rabbits and rodents were once attributed to convergent evolution, but studies in molecular biology have found a common ancestor between lagomorphs and rodents and place them in the clade Glires.

Rabbit physiology is suited to escaping predators and surviving in various habitats, living either alone or in groups in nests or burrows. As prey animals, rabbits are constantly aware of their surroundings, having a wide field of vision and ears with high surface area to detect potential predators. The ears of a rabbit are essential for thermoregulation and contain a high density of blood vessels. The bone structure of a rabbit&#x27;s hind legs, which is longer than that of the fore legs, allows for quick hopping, which is beneficial for escaping predators and can provide powerful kicks if captured. Rabbits are typically nocturnal and often sleep with their eyes open. They reproduce quickly, having short pregnancies, large litters of four to twelve kits, and no particular mating season; however, the mortality rate of rabbit embryos is high, and there exist several widespread diseases that affect rabbits, such as rabbit hemorrhagic disease and myxomatosis. In some regions, especially Australia, rabbits have caused ecological problems and are regarded as a pest.

Humans have used rabbits as livestock since at least the first century BC in ancient Rome, raising them for their meat, fur and wool. The various breeds of the European rabbit have been developed to suit each of these products; the practice of raising and breeding rabbits as livestock is known as cuniculture. Rabbits are seen in human culture globally, appearing as a symbol of fertility, cunning, and innocence in major religions, historical and contemporary art.

==Terminology and etymology==
The word rabbit derives from the Middle English (&quot;young of the coney&quot;), a borrowing from the Walloon , which was a diminutive of the French or Middle Dutch (&quot;rabbit&quot;), a term of unknown origin. The term &quot;coney&quot; is a term for an adult rabbit used until the 18th century; &quot;rabbit&quot; once referred only to the young animals. More recently, the term &quot;kit&quot; or &quot;kitten&quot; has been used to refer to a young rabbit. The endearing word &quot;bunny&quot; is attested by the 1680s as a diminutive of &quot;bun&quot;, a term used in Scotland to refer to rabbits and squirrels.

&quot;Coney&quot; is derived from &quot;cuniculus&quot;, a Latin term referring to rabbits which has been in use from at least the first century BCE in Hispania. The word &quot;cuniculus&quot; may originate from a diminutive form of the word for &quot;dog&quot; in the Celtic languages.

A group of rabbits is known as a &quot;colony,&quot; &quot;nest&quot;, or &quot;warren&quot;, though the latter term more commonly refers to where the rabbits live. A group of baby rabbits produced from a single mating is referred to as a &quot;litter&quot; and a group of domestic rabbits living together is sometimes called a &quot;herd&quot;.

A male rabbit is called a &quot;buck&quot;, as are male goats and deer, derived from the Old English or &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;he-goat&quot; or &quot;male deer&quot;, respectively. A female is called a &quot;doe&quot;, derived from the Old English , related to (&quot;to suck&quot;).
==Taxonomy and evolution==
Rabbits and hares were formerly classified in the order Rodentia (rodents) until 1912, when they were moved into the order Lagomorpha (which also includes pikas). Since 1945, there has been support for the clade Glires that includes both rodents and lagomorphs, though the two groups have always been closely associated in taxonomy; fossil, DNA, and retrotransposon studies in the 2000s have solidified support for the clade. Studies in paleontology and molecular biology suggest that rodents and lagomorphs diverged at the start of the Tertiary period.

The extant species of family Leporidae, of which there are more than 70, are contained within 11 genera, one of which is &quot;Lepus&quot;, the hares. There are 32 extant species within &quot;Lepus&quot;. The cladogram is from Matthee et al., 2004, based on nuclear and mitochondrial gene analysis.

===Differences from hares===

The term &quot;rabbit&quot; is typically used for all Leporidae species, excluding the genus &quot;Lepus&quot;. Members of that genus are known as &quot;hares&quot; or &quot;jackrabbits&quot;.

&quot;Lepus&quot; species are precocial, born relatively mature and mobile with hair and good vision out in the open air, while rabbit species are altricial, born hairless and blind in burrows and buried nests. Hares are also generally larger than rabbits, and have longer pregnancies. Hares and some rabbits live relatively solitary lives above the ground in open grassy areas, interacting mainly during breeding season. Some rabbit species group together to reduce their chance of being preyed upon, and the European rabbit will form large social groups in burrows, which are grouped together to form warrens. Burrowing by hares varies by location, and is more prominent in younger members of the genus; many rabbit species that do not dig their own burrows will use the burrows of other animals.

Rabbits and hares have historically not occupied the same locations, and only became sympatric relatively recently; historic accounts describe antagonistic relationships between rabbits and hares, specifically between the European hare and European or cottontail rabbits, but scientific literature since 1956 has found no evidence of aggression or undue competition between rabbits and hares. When they appear in the same habitat, rabbits and hares can co-exist on similar diets. Hares will notably force other hare species out of an area to control resources, but are not territorial. When faced with predators, hares will escape by outrunning them, whereas rabbits, being smaller and less able to reach the high speeds of longer-legged hares, will try to seek cover.

Descendants of the European rabbit are commonly bred as livestock and kept as pets, whereas no hares have been domesticated, though populations have been introduced to non-native habitats for use as a food source. The breed known as the Belgian hare is actually a domestic rabbit which has been selectively bred to resemble a hare, most likely from Flemish Giant stock originally. Common names of hare and rabbit species may also be confused; &quot;jackrabbits&quot; refer to hares, and the hispid hare is a rabbit.

===Domestication===
Rabbits, specifically the European rabbit (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;) species, have long been domesticated. The European rabbit has been widely kept as livestock, starting in ancient Rome from at least the first century BC. Selective breeding, which began in the Middle Ages, has generated a wide variety of rabbit breeds, of which many (since the early 19th century) are also kept as pets. Some strains of European rabbit have been bred specifically as research subjects, such as the New Zealand white.

As livestock, European rabbits are bred for their meat and fur. The earliest breeds were important sources of meat, and so were bred to be larger than wild rabbits at younger ages, but domestic rabbits in modern times range in size from dwarf to giant. Rabbit fur, produced as a byproduct of meat production but occasionally selected for as in the case of the Rex rabbit, can be found in a broad range of coat colors and patterns, some of which are produced via dyeing. Some breeds are raised for their wool, such as the Angora rabbit breeds; their fur is sheared, combed or plucked, and the fibers are spun into yarn.

==Biology==
===Evolution===
The earliest ancestor of rabbits and hares lived 55 million years ago in what is now Mongolia. Because the rabbit&#x27;s epiglottis is engaged over the soft palate except when swallowing, the rabbit is an obligate nasal breather. As lagomorphs, rabbits have two sets of incisor teeth, one behind the other, a manner in which they differ from rodents, which only have one set of incisors. Another difference is that for rabbits, all of their teeth continue to grow, whereas for most rodents, only their incisors continue to grow. Carl Linnaeus originally grouped rabbits and rodents under the class Glires; later, they were separated as the scientific consensus is that many of their similarities were a result of convergent evolution. DNA analysis and the discovery of a common ancestor have supported the view that they share a common lineage, so rabbits and rodents are now often grouped together in the clade or superorder Glires.

===Morphology===

Since speed and agility are a rabbit&#x27;s main defenses against predators, rabbits have large hind leg bones and well-developed musculature. Though plantigrade at rest, rabbits are on their toes while running, assuming a more digitigrade posture. Rabbits use their strong claws for digging and (along with their teeth) for defense. Each front foot has four toes plus a dewclaw. Each hind foot has four toes (but no dewclaw).
Most wild rabbits (especially compared to hares) have relatively full, egg-shaped bodies. The soft coat of the wild rabbit is agouti in coloration (or, rarely, melanistic), which aids in camouflage. The tail of the rabbit (with the exception of the cottontail species) is dark on top and white below. Cottontails have white on the top of their tails.

As a result of the position of the eyes in its skull and the size of the cornea, the rabbit has a panoramic field of vision that encompasses nearly 360 degrees. However, there is a blind spot at the bridge of the nose, and because of this, rabbits cannot see what is below their mouth and rely on their lips and whiskers to determine what they are eating. Blinking occurs 2 to 4 times an hour.

===Hind limb elements===

The anatomy of rabbits&#x27; hind limbs is structurally similar to that of other land mammals and contributes to their specialized form of locomotion. The bones of the hind limbs consist of long bones (the femur, tibia, fibula, and phalanges) as well as short bones (the tarsals). These bones are created through endochondral ossification during fetal development. Like most land mammals, the round head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum of the os coxae, the hip bone. The femur articulates with the tibia, but not the fibula, which is fused to the tibia. The tibia and fibula articulate with the tarsals of the pes, commonly called the foot. The hind limbs of the rabbit are longer than the front limbs. This allows them to produce their hopping form of locomotion. Longer hind limbs are more capable of producing faster speeds. Hares, which have longer legs than cottontail rabbits, are able to move considerably faster. The hind feet have four long toes that allow for digitigrade movement, which are webbed to prevent them from spreading when hopping. Rabbits do not have paw pads on their feet like most other animals that use digitigrade locomotion. Instead, they have coarse compressed hair that offers protection.

====Musculature====
Rabbits have muscled hind legs that allow for maximum force, maneuverability, and acceleration that is divided into three main parts: foot, thigh, and leg. The hind limbs of a rabbit are an exaggerated feature. They are much longer and can provide more force than the forelimbs, which are structured like brakes to take the brunt of the landing after a leap. The force put out by the hind limbs is contributed by both the structural anatomy of the fusion of the tibia and fibula, and by the muscular features.

Bone formation and removal, from a cellular standpoint, is directly correlated to hind limb muscles. Action pressure from muscles creates force that is then distributed through the skeletal structures. Rabbits that generate less force, putting less stress on bones are more prone to osteoporosis due to bone rarefaction. In rabbits, the more fibers in a muscle, the more resistant to fatigue. For example, hares have a greater resistance to fatigue than cottontails. The muscles of rabbit&#x27;s hind limbs can be classified into four main categories: hamstrings, quadriceps, dorsiflexors, or plantar flexors. The quadriceps muscles are in charge of force production when jumping. Complementing these muscles are the hamstrings, which aid in short bursts of action. These muscles play off of one another in the same way as the plantar flexors and dorsiflexors, contributing to the generation and actions associated with force.

===Ears===
Within the order of lagomorphs, the ears are used to detect and avoid predators. In the family Leporidae, the ears are typically longer than they are wide, and are in general relatively long compared to other mammals.

According to Allen&#x27;s rule, endothermic animals adapted to colder climates have shorter, thicker limbs and appendages than those of similar animals adapted to warm climates. The rule was originally derived by comparing the ear lengths of &quot;Lepus&quot; species across the various climates of North America. Subsequent studies show that this rule remains true in the Leporidae for the ears specifically, in that the surface area of rabbits&#x27; and hares&#x27; ears are enlarged in warm climates; the ears are an important structure to aid thermoregulation as well as in detecting predators due to the way the outer, middle, and inner ear muscles coordinate with one another. The ear muscles also aid in maintaining balance and movement when fleeing predators.

The auricle, also known as the pinna, is a rabbit&#x27;s outer ear. The rabbit&#x27;s pinnae represent a fair part of the body surface area. It is theorized that the ears aid in dispersion of heat at temperatures above , with rabbits in warmer climates having longer pinnae due to this. Another theory is that the ears function as shock absorbers that could aid and stabilize rabbits&#x27; vision when fleeing predators, but this has typically only been seen in hares. The rest of the outer ear has bent canals that lead to the eardrum or tympanic membrane.

The middle ear, separated by the outer eardrum in the back of the rabbit&#x27;s skull, contains three bones: the hammer, anvil, and stirrup, collectively called ossicles, which act to decrease sound before it hits the inner ear; in general, the ossicles act as a barrier to the inner ear for sound energy.

Inner ear fluid, called endolymph, receives the sound energy. After receiving the energy. The inner ear comprises two parts: the cochlea that uses sound waves from the ossicles, and the vestibular apparatus that manages the rabbit&#x27;s position in regard to movement. Within the cochlea a basilar membrane contains sensory hair structures that send nerve signals to the brain, allowing it to recognize different sound frequencies. Within the vestibular apparatus three semicircular canals help detect angular motion.

==== Thermoregulation ====

The pinnae, which contain a vascular network and arteriovenous shunts, aid in thermoregulation. In a rabbit, the optimal body temperature is around . If their body temperature exceeds or does not meet this optimal temperature, the rabbit must make efforts to return to homeostasis. Homeostasis of body temperature is maintained by changing the amount of blood flow that passes through the highly vascularized ears, as rabbits have few to no sweat glands. Rabbits may also regulate their temperature by resting in depressions in the ground, known as forms.

===Respiratory system===
The rabbit&#x27;s nasal cavity lies dorsal to the oral cavity, and the two compartments are separated by the hard and soft palate. The nasal cavity itself is separated into a left and right side by a cartilage barrier, and it is covered in fine hairs that trap dust before it can enter the respiratory tract. As the rabbit breathes, air flows in through the nostrils along the alar folds. From there, the air moves into the nasal cavity, also known as the nasopharynx, down through the trachea, through the larynx, and into the lungs. The larynx functions as the rabbit&#x27;s voice box, which enables it to produce a wide variety of sounds. The trachea is a long tube embedded with cartilaginous rings that prevent the tube from collapsing as air moves in and out of the lungs. The trachea then splits into a left and right bronchus, which meet the lungs at a structure called the hilum. From there, the bronchi split into progressively more narrow and numerous branches. The bronchi branch into bronchioles, into respiratory bronchioles, and ultimately terminate at the alveolar ducts. The branching that is typically found in rabbit lungs is a clear example of monopodial branching, in which smaller branches divide out laterally from a larger central branch.

The structure of the rabbit&#x27;s nasal and oral cavities necessitates breathing through the nose. This is due to the fact that the epiglottis is fixed to the backmost portion of the soft palate. Within the oral cavity, a layer of tissue sits over the opening of the glottis, which blocks airflow from the oral cavity to the trachea. The epiglottis functions to prevent the rabbit from aspirating on its food. Further, the presence of a soft and hard palate allow the rabbit to breathe through its nose while it feeds.

Rabbits&#x27; lungs are divided into four lobes: the cranial, middle, caudal, and accessory lobes. The right lung is made up of all four lobes, while the left lung only has two: the cranial and caudal lobes. To provide space for the heart, the left cranial lobe of the lungs is significantly smaller than that of the right. The diaphragm is a muscular structure that lies caudal to the lungs and contracts to facilitate respiration.
===Diet and digestion===
Rabbits are strict herbivores and are suited to a diet high in fiber, mostly in the form of cellulose. They will typically graze grass upon waking up and emerging from a burrow, and will move on to consume vegetation and other plants throughout the waking period; rabbits have been known to eat a wide variety of plants, including tree leaves and fruits, though consumption of fruit and lower fiber foods is common for pet rabbits where natural vegetation is scarce.

Easily digestible food is processed in the gastrointestinal tract and expelled as regular feces. To get nutrients out of hard to digest fiber, rabbits ferment fiber in the cecum (part of the gastrointestinal tract) and then expel the contents as cecotropes, which are reingested (cecotrophy or refection). The cecotropes are then absorbed in the small intestine to use the nutrients. Soft cecotropes are usually consumed during periods of rest in underground burrows.
Rabbits cannot vomit; and therefore if buildup occurs within the intestines (due often to a diet with insufficient fibre), intestinal blockage can occur.

===Reproduction===

The adult male reproductive system forms the same as most mammals with the seminiferous tubular compartment containing the Sertoli cells and an adluminal compartment that contains the Leydig cells. The Leydig cells produce testosterone, which maintains libido and creates secondary sex characteristics such as the genital tubercle and penis. The Sertoli cells triggers the production of Anti-Müllerian duct hormone, which absorbs the Müllerian duct. In an adult male rabbit, the sheath of the penis is cylinder-like and can be extruded as early as two months of age. The scrotal sacs lay lateral to the penis and contain epididymal fat pads which protect the testes. Between 10 and 14 weeks, the testes descend and are able to retract into the pelvic cavity to thermoregulate. Furthermore, the secondary sex characteristics, such as the testes, are complex and secrete many compounds. These compounds include fructose, citric acid, minerals, and a uniquely high amount of catalase, all of which affect the characteristics of rabbit semen; for instance, citric acid is positively correlated with agglutination, and high amounts of catalase protect against premature capacitation.
The adult female reproductive tract is bipartite, which prevents an embryo from translocating between uteri. The female urethra and vagina open into a urogenital sinus with a single urogenital opening. The two uterine horns communicate to two cervixes and forms one vaginal canal. Along with being bipartite, the female rabbit does not go through an estrus cycle, which causes mating induced ovulation.

The average female rabbit becomes sexually mature at three to eight months of age and can conceive at any time of the year for the duration of her life. Egg and sperm production can begin to decline after three years, with some species such as those in genus &quot;Oryctolagus&quot; completely stopping reproduction at 6 years of age. During mating, the male rabbit will insert his penis into the female from behind, make rapid pelvic thrusts until ejaculation, and throw himself backward off the female. Copulation lasts only 20–40 seconds.

The rabbit gestation period is short and ranges from 27 to 30 days. A longer gestation period will generally yield a smaller litter while shorter gestation periods will give birth to a larger litter. The size of a single litter can range from 1 to 12 kits, depending on species. After birth, the only role of males is to protect the young from other rabbits, and the mother will leave the young in the nest most of the day, returning to nurse them once every 24 hours. The female can become pregnant again as early as the next day.

After mating, the doe will begin to dig a burrow or prepare a nest before giving birth. Between three days and a few hours before giving birth another series of hormonal changes will cause her to prepare the nest structure. The doe will first gather grass for a structure, and an elevation in prolactin shortly before birth will cause her fur to shed that the doe will then use to line the nest, providing insulation for the newborn kits.

The mortality rates of embryos are high in rabbits and can be due to infection, trauma, poor nutrition and environmental stress. A high fertility rate is necessary to counter this. More than half of rabbit pregnancies are aborted, causing embryos to be resorbed into the mother&#x27;s body; vitamin deficiencies are a major cause of abortions in domestic rabbits.

===Sleep===
Rabbits may appear to be crepuscular, but many species are naturally inclined towards nocturnal activity. In 2011, the average sleep time of a rabbit in captivity was calculated at 8.4 hours per day; previous studies have estimated sleep periods as long as 11.4 hours on average, undergoing both slow-wave and rapid eye movement sleep. Newborn rabbits will sleep for 22 hours a day before leaving the nest. As with other prey animals, rabbits often sleep with their eyes open, so that sudden movements will awaken the rabbit to respond to potential danger.
===Diseases and immunity===
In addition to being at risk of disease from common pathogens such as &quot;Bordetella bronchiseptica&quot; and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, rabbits can contract the virulent, species-specific viruses myxomatosis, and a form of calicivirus which causes rabbit hemorrhagic disease. Myxomatosis is more hazardous to pet rabbits, as wild rabbits often have some immunity. Among the parasites that infect rabbits are tapeworms (such as &quot;Taenia serialis)&quot;, external parasites (including fleas and mites), coccidia species, &quot;Encephalitozoon cuniculi&quot;, and &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot;. Domesticated rabbits with a diet lacking in high-fiber sources, such as hay and grass, are susceptible to potentially lethal gastrointestinal stasis. Rabbits and hares are almost never found to be infected with rabies and have not been known to transmit rabies to humans.

Rabbit hemorrhagic disease (RHD) is a highly infectious rabbit-specific disease caused by strains of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), including type 2 (RHDV2). The disease was first described in domestic Angora rabbits imported from Germany to Jiangsu, China in 1984, and quickly spread to Korea, Italy, and the rest of Europe. The disease spread to the Americas from 1988, first appearing in rabbits imported to Mexico, but subsequent outbreaks were infrequent, as RHDV only affected the European rabbit species. RHDV2, a strain of RHD-causing virus that affects both domestic and wild lagomorphs, such as hares, was detected for the first time in France in 2010. RHDV2 has since spread to the rest of Europe, Canada, Australia, and the United States.

==Ecology==

Rabbits are prey animals. In Mediterranean Europe, for example, rabbits are the main prey of red foxes, badgers, and Iberian lynxes. To avoid predation and to navigate underground, rabbits have heightened senses (compared to humans) and are constantly aware of their surroundings. If confronted by a potential threat, a rabbit may freeze and observe, then warn others in the warren with powerful thumps on the ground from a hind foot. Rabbits have a remarkably wide field of vision, and a good deal of it is devoted to overhead scanning. A rabbit eye has no fovea, but a &quot;visual streak&quot;, a horizontal line in the middle of the retina where both rod and cone cell densities are the highest. This allows them to scan the horizon with little head turning.

Rabbits survive predation by burrowing (in some species), and hopping away to dense cover. Their strong teeth allow them to bite to escape a struggle.

The longest-lived rabbit on record, a domesticated European rabbit living in Tasmania, died at age 18. The lifespan of wild rabbits is much shorter; the average longevity of an eastern cottontail, for instance, is about one to five years. The various species of rabbit have been recorded as living from four to 13 years in captivity.

===Habitat and range===

Rabbit habitats include forests, steppes, plateaus, deserts, and swamps. Some species, such as the volcano rabbit (&quot;Romerolagus diazi&quot;) have especially limited distribution due to their habitat needs. Rabbits live in groups, or colonies, varying in behavior depending on species and often using the burrows of other animals or creating nests in holes. The European rabbit notably lives in extensive burrow networks called &quot;warrens&quot;.

Rabbits are native to North America, southwestern Europe, Southeast Asia, Sumatra, some islands of Japan, and parts of Africa and South America. They are not naturally found in most of Eurasia, where a number of species of hares are present. A 2003 study on domestic rabbits in China found that &quot;(so-called) Chinese rabbits were introduced from Europe&quot;, and that &quot;genetic diversity in Chinese rabbits was very low&quot;.

Rabbits first entered South America relatively recently, as part of the Great American Interchange. Much of the continent was considered to have just one species of rabbit, the tapeti, and most of South America&#x27;s Southern Cone has had no rabbits until the introduction of the European rabbit, which has been introduced to many places around the world, in the late 19th century.

Rabbits have been launched into space orbit.

===Marking===
Both sexes of rabbits often rub their chins on objects with their scent gland located under the chin. This is the rabbit&#x27;s way of marking their territory or possessions for other rabbits to recognize by depositing scent gland secretions. Rabbits who have bonded will respect each other&#x27;s smell, which indicates a territorial border. Rabbits also have scent glands that produce a strong-smelling waxy substance near their anuses. Territorial marking by scent glands has been documented among both domestic and wild rabbit species.

===Environmental problems===
Rabbits, particularly the European rabbit, have been a source of environmental problems when introduced into the wild by humans. As a result of their appetites, and the rate at which they breed, feral rabbit depredation can be problematic for agriculture. Gassing (fumigation of warrens), barriers (fences), shooting, snaring, and ferreting have been used to control rabbit populations, but the most effective measures are diseases such as myxomatosis and calicivirus. In Europe, where domestic rabbits are farmed on a large scale, they can be protected against myxomatosis and calicivirus via vaccination. Rabbits in Australia and New Zealand are considered to be such a pest that landowners are legally obliged to control them.

Rabbits are known to be able to catch fire and spread wildfires, particularly in Chile, where the European rabbit is an invasive species, but the efficiency and relevance of this mechanism has been doubted by forest experts who contend that a rabbit on fire could move some meters. Knowledge on fire-spreading rabbits is based on anecdotes as there is no known scientific investigation on the subject.

==As food and clothing==


Humans have hunted rabbits for food since at least the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum, and wild rabbits and hares are still hunted for their meat as game. Hunting is accomplished with the aid of trained falcons, ferrets, or dogs (a common hunting breed being beagles), as well as with snares, rifles and other guns. A caught rabbit may be dispatched with a sharp blow to the back of its head, a practice from which the term &quot;rabbit punch&quot; is derived.

Wild leporids comprise a small portion of global rabbit-meat consumption. Domesticated descendants of the European rabbit (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;) that are bred and kept as livestock (a practice called cuniculture) account for the estimated 200million tons of rabbit meat produced annually. Approximately 1.2 billion rabbits are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide. In 1994, the countries with the highest consumption per capita of rabbit meat were Malta with , Italy with , and Cyprus with . The largest producers of rabbit meat were China, Russia, Italy (specifically Veneto), France, and Spain. Rabbit meat was once a common commodity in Sydney, with European rabbits having been introduced intentionally to Australia for hunting purposes, but declined after the myxomatosis virus was intentionally introduced to control the exploding population of feral rabbits in the area.

In the United Kingdom, fresh rabbits are sold in butcher shops and markets, and some supermarkets sell frozen rabbit meat. It is sold in farmers markets there, including the Borough Market in London. Rabbit meat is a feature of Moroccan cuisine, where it is cooked in a tajine with &quot;raisins and grilled almonds added a few minutes before serving&quot;. In China, rabbit meat is particularly popular in Sichuan cuisine, with its stewed rabbit, spicy diced rabbit, BBQ-style rabbit, and even spicy rabbit heads, which have been compared to &quot;spicy duck neck&quot;. In the United States, rabbits sold as food are typically the domestic New Zealand, Belgian, and Chinese rabbits, or Scottish hares.

An infectious disease associated with rabbits-as-food is tularemia (also known as &quot;rabbit fever&quot;), which may be contracted from an infected rabbit. The disease can cause symptoms of fever, skin ulcers and enlarged lymph nodes, and can occasionally lead to pneumonia or throat infection. Secondary vectors of tularemia include tick and fly bites, which may be present in the fur of a caught rabbit. Inhaling the bacteria during the skinning process increases the risk of getting tularemia; preventative measures against this include the use of gloves and face masks. Prior to the development of antibiotics, such as docycycline and gentamicin, the death rate associated with tularemia infections was 60%, which has since decreased to less than 4%.

In addition to their meat, domestic rabbits are used for their wool and fur for clothing, as well as their nitrogen-rich manure and their high-protein milk. Production industries have developed domesticated rabbit breeds (such as the Angora rabbit) for the purpose of meeting these needs. In 1986, the number of rabbit skins produced annually in France was as high as 70 million, compared to 25 million mink pelts produced at the same time. However, rabbit fur is on the whole a byproduct of rabbit meat production, whereas minks are bred primarily for fur production.
==In culture==

Rabbits are often posited by scholars as symbols of fertility, sexuality and spring, though they have been variously interpreted throughout history. Up until the end of the 18th century, it was widely believed that rabbits and hares were hermaphrodites, contributing to a possible view of rabbits as &quot;sexually aberrant&quot;. The Easter Bunny is a figure from German folklore that then spread to America and later other parts of the world and is similar to Santa Claus, albeit both with softened roles compared to earlier incarnations of the figures.

The rabbits&#x27; role as a prey animal with few defenses evokes vulnerability and innocence in folklore and modern children&#x27;s stories, and rabbits appear as sympathetic characters, able to connect easily with youth, though this particular symbolic depiction only became popular in the 1930s following the massive popularization of the pet rabbit decades before. Additionally, they have not been limited to sympathetic depictions since then, as in literature such as &quot;Watership Down&quot; and the works of Ariel Dorfman. With its reputation as a prolific breeder, the rabbit juxtaposes sexuality with innocence, as in the Playboy Bunny. The rabbit has also been used as a symbol of playfulness and endurance, as represented by the Energizer Bunny and the Duracell Bunny.

===Folklore and mythology===
The rabbit often appears in folklore as the trickster archetype, as he uses his cunning to outwit his enemies. In Central Africa, the common hare (&quot;Kalulu&quot;) is described as a trickster figure, and in Aztec mythology, a pantheon of four hundred rabbit gods known as Centzon Totochtin, led by Ometochtli or Two Rabbit, represented fertility, parties, and drunkenness. Rabbits in the Americas varied in mythological symbolism: in Aztec mythology, they were also associated with the moon, and in Anishinaabe traditional beliefs, held by the Ojibwe and some other Native American peoples, Nanabozho, or Great Rabbit, is an important deity related to the creation of the world. More broadly, a rabbit&#x27;s foot may be carried as an amulet, believed to bring protection and good luck. This belief is found in many parts of the world, with the earliest use being recorded in Europe .

Rabbits also appear in Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese and Korean mythology, though rabbits are a relatively new introduction to some of these regions. In Chinese folklore, rabbits accompany Chang&#x27;e on the Moon, and the moon rabbit is a prominent symbol in the Mid-Autumn Festival. In the Chinese New Year, the zodiacal rabbit or hare is one of the twelve celestial animals in the Chinese zodiac. At the time of the zodiacal cycles becoming associated with animals in the Han dynasty, only hares were native to China, with the currently extant breeds of rabbit in China being of European origin. The Vietnamese zodiac includes a zodiacal cat in place of the rabbit. The most common explanation is that the ancient Vietnamese word for &quot;rabbit&quot; &quot;(mao)&quot; sounds like the Chinese word for &quot;cat&quot; (, &quot;mao)&quot;. In Japanese tradition, rabbits live on the Moon where they make mochi. This comes from interpreting the pattern of dark patches on the moon as a rabbit standing on tiptoes on the left pounding on an usu, a Japanese mortar. In Korean mythology, as in Japanese, rabbits live on the moon making rice cakes (&quot;tteok&quot; in Korean).

Rabbits have also appeared in religious symbolism. Buddhism, Christianity, and Judaism have associations with an ancient circular motif called the &quot;three rabbits&quot; (or &quot;three hares&quot;). Its meaning ranges from &quot;peace and tranquility&quot; to the Holy Trinity. The tripartite symbol also appears in heraldry. In Jewish folklore, rabbits are associated with cowardice, a usage still current in contemporary Israeli spoken Hebrew. The original Hebrew word (shfanim, שפנים) refers to the hyrax, but early translations to English interpreted the word to mean &quot;rabbit&quot;, as no hyraxes were known to northern Europe. 

=== Modern times ===

The rabbit as trickster is a part of American popular culture, as Br&#x27;er Rabbit (from African-American folktales and, later, Disney animation) and Bugs Bunny (the cartoon character from Warner Bros.), for example.

Anthropomorphized rabbits have appeared in film and literature, in &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot; (the White Rabbit and the March Hare characters), in &quot;Watership Down&quot; (including the film and television adaptations), in &quot;Rabbit Hill&quot; (by Robert Lawson), and in the &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot; stories (by Beatrix Potter). In the 1920s, &quot;Oswald the Lucky Rabbit&quot; was a popular cartoon character.

On the Isle of Portland in Dorset, UK, the rabbit is said to be unlucky, and speaking the creature&#x27;s name can cause upset among older island residents. This is thought to date back to early times in the local quarrying industry, where, to save space, extracted stones that were not fit for sale were set aside in what became tall, unstable walls. The local rabbits&#x27; tendency to burrow there would weaken the walls, and their collapse would result in injuries or even death. In the local culture to this day, the rabbit (when he has to be referred to) may instead be called a &quot;long ears&quot; or &quot;underground mutton&quot; so as not to risk bringing a downfall upon oneself.

In other parts of Britain and in North America, &quot;Rabbit rabbit rabbit&quot; is one variant of an apotropaic or talismanic superstition that involves saying or repeating the word &quot;rabbit&quot; (or &quot;rabbits&quot; or &quot;white rabbits&quot; or some combination thereof) out loud upon waking on the first day of each month, because doing so is believed to ensure good fortune for the duration of that month.

The &quot;rabbit test&quot; is a term first used in 1949 for the Friedman test, an early diagnostic tool for detecting a pregnancy in humans. It is a common misconception (or perhaps an urban legend) that the test-rabbit would die if the woman was pregnant. This led to the phrase &quot;the rabbit died&quot; becoming a euphemism for a positive pregnancy test.

Many modern children&#x27;s stories and cartoons portray rabbits as particularly fond of eating carrots, largely due to the popularity of Bugs Bunny, whose carrot eating habit was modeled after Peter Wayne, the character played by Clark Gable in the 1934 romantic comedy &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;. This is a misleading as wild rabbits do not naturally prefer carrots over other plants. Carrots are high in sugar, and excessive consumption can be unhealthy. This has led to some owners of domestic rabbits feeding a carrot heavy diet on this false perception.

<text>Robert Arthur Moog ( ; May 23, 1934 – August 21, 2005) was an American engineer and electronic music pioneer. He was the founder of the synthesizer manufacturer Moog Music and the inventor of the first commercial synthesizer, the Moog synthesizer, which debuted in 1964. In 1970, Moog released a more portable model, the Minimoog, described as the most famous and influential synthesizer in history. Among Moog&#x27;s honors are a Technical Grammy Award, received in 2002, and an induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

By 1963, Moog had been designing and selling theremins for several years while working toward a PhD in engineering physics at Cornell University. He developed his synthesizer in response to demand for more practical and affordable electronic-music equipment, guided by suggestions and requests from composers. Moog&#x27;s principal innovation was the voltage-controlled oscillator, which uses voltage to control pitch. He also introduced fundamental synthesizer concepts such as modularity, envelope generation and the pitch wheel. He is credited with introducing synthesizers to a wider audience and influencing the development of popular music.

Moog pursued his work as a hobby, and he is regarded as a poor businessman. His only patent was on his transistor ladder filter design; commentators have speculated that he would have become extremely wealthy had he patented his other innovations, but that their availability in the public domain helped the synthesizer industry flourish.

In 1971, Moog sold Moog Music to Norlin Musical Instruments, where he remained as a designer until 1977. In 1978, he founded the company Big Briar, and in 2002 he renamed it Moog Music after reacquiring the rights to the name. In later years, Moog taught at the University of North Carolina at Asheville and continued designing instruments for the revived Moog Music. He died at the age of 71 in Asheville from a brain tumor.

== Early life and education ==
Robert Moog was born at Flushing Hospital in New York City on May 23, 1934. His father was George Conrad Moog, of German descent. His mother was Shirley (Jacobs) Moog, of Polish-Jewish descent. He was raised in Flushing, Queens.

When he was a boy, Moog&#x27;s mother forced him to study the piano. He was active in the Boy Scouts, and especially enjoyed spending time with his father, a Consolidated Edison engineer, visiting Manhattan&#x27;s Radio Row and working on radio and electronics projects. He became fascinated by the theremin, an electronic instrument controlled by moving the hands over radio antennae. In 1949, at the age of 14, he built a theremin from plans printed in &quot;Electronics World&quot;.

He graduated from the Bronx High School of Science in 1952. He earned a Bachelor of Science in physics from Queens College of the City University of New York in 1955, and a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering from the Columbia University School of Engineering and Applied Science under a 3-2 engineering program in 1957. He earned a PhD in engineering physics from Cornell University in 1965.

== Career ==

===Theremins and R.A. Moog Co.===
In 1953, Moog produced his own theremin design, and in the following year, he published an article on the theremin in &quot;Radio and Television News&quot;. That same year, he founded R.A. Moog Co., building theremins and theremin kits in his parents&#x27; home and selling them via mail order. In 1956, Moog and his father visited Raymond Scott&#x27;s Manhattan Research facility, and Scott purchased a Moog Model 305 theremin. Scott rewired the Moog theremin to be controlled by a keyboard, dubbing his creation the Clavivox. Moog married in 1958 and continued building and selling theremin kits from his own home in Ithaca, before establishing the company&#x27;s first commercial space at 41 East Main Street in Trumansburg, New York in 1963, all while continuing to pursue his postgraduate education.

=== Moog synthesizer ===
At Cornell, Moog began work on his first synthesizer components with composer Herb Deutsch. At the time, synthesizers were enormous, room-filling instruments; Moog hoped to build a more compact synthesizer that would appeal to musicians. He believed that practicality and affordability were the most important parameters.

In 1964, Moog began creating the Moog modular synthesizer. It was composed of separate modules that created and shaped sounds, connected by patch cords. Previous synthesizers, such as the RCA Mark II, had created sound from hundreds of vacuum tubes. Instead, Moog used recently available silicon transistors with an exponential relationship between input voltage and output current. With these, he created the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), which generates a waveform with a pitch that could be adjusted by changing the voltage. Similarly, he used voltage to control loudness with voltage-controlled amplifiers (VCAs). One innovative feature was its envelope, which controls how notes swell and fade. According to the &quot;Guardian&quot;, Moog&#x27;s 1964 paper &quot;Voltage-Controlled Music Modules&quot;, in which he proposed the Moog synthesizer modules, invented the modern concept of the analog synthesizer.

Moog debuted the instrument at the 1964 Audio Engineering Society convention in New York. It was much smaller than other synthesizers, such as the RCA Synthesizer introduced a decade earlier, and much cheaper, at US$10,000, as compared to the six-figure sums of other synthesizers. Whereas the RCA Synthesizer was programmed with punchcards, Moog&#x27;s synthesizer could be programmed with knobs and patch cables and played via keyboard, making it attractive to musicians. &quot;New Scientist&quot; described it as the first commercial synthesizer.
At this time, Moog and then Fred Cochran constructed the so-called Moogtonium for the composer Max Brand. It is still operational and exhibited in the Langenzersdorf_Museum near Vienna (Austria).

Moog described himself as a toolmaker designing things for his users, not himself. His development was driven by requests and suggestions from various musicians, including Deutsch (who devised the instrument&#x27;s keyboard interface), Richard Teitelbaum, Vladimir Ussachevsky (credited with devising the ADSR envelope shape), and Wendy Carlos. His other early customers included choreographer and composer Alwin Nikolais and composer John Cage. Universities established electronic music studios with Moog synthesizers. In 1970, Moog released the portable fixed-architecture Minimoog, described as the most famous and influential synthesizer in history.

=== Company decline ===
Though commentators have praised Moog&#x27;s engineering abilities, some have also described him as a poor businessman. Moog had pursued the development of his synthesizer as a hobby, stressing that he was regarded as a businessman but had not known what a balance sheet was. He likened the experience to a theme park ride: &quot;You know you&#x27;re not going to get hurt too badly because nobody would let you do that, but you&#x27;re not quite in control.&quot;

Moog only patented his filter design; David Borden, one of the first users of the Minimoog, felt that if Moog had patented his pitch wheel design, he would have become extremely wealthy. According to &quot;Sound on Sound&quot;, if Moog had created a monopoly on other synthesizer ideas that he created, such as modularity, envelope generation and voltage control, &quot;it&#x27;s likely the synth industry as we know it today would never have happened.&quot;

Beginning in 1971, Moog Music absorbed investors, merged with Norlin Musical Instruments and moved to &quot;less than ideal&quot; premises near Buffalo, New York, amid a debilitating recession. Moog remained employed as a designer at the company until 1977. He said that he would have left earlier if his contract had not required him to remain employed there for four years to cash his stock. By the end of the decade, Moog Music was facing competition from cheaper, easier-to-use instruments by competitors including ARP, Aries, Roland, and E-mu.

=== Big Briar, return of Moog Music ===
In 1978, Moog moved to North Carolina and founded a new electronic instrument company, Big Briar. He also worked as a consultant and vice president for new product research at Kurzweil Music Systems from 1984 to 1988. In the early 1990s, he was a research professor of music at the University of North Carolina at Asheville. In 2002, he renamed Big Briar to Moog Music after retrieving the rights to the name. In later years, he continued to design electronic instruments, including a touchscreen-operated piano.

==Personal life and death==
Moog married Shirley May Leigh on June 15, 1958. They had four children, Laura (1961), Renée (1963), Michelle (1967), and Matthew (1970). They divorced in 1994. On May 19, 1996 Moog married Ileana Grams.

Moog was diagnosed with a glioblastoma multiforme brain tumor on April 28, 2005. He died on August 21, 2005, at the age of 71 in Asheville, North Carolina. He was survived by his second wife Ileana, four children, one stepdaughter and five grandchildren.

==Legacy==
Moog has had a lasting influence on music. The BBC describes him as a pioneer of synthesized sound. According to the &quot;Guardian&quot;, his inventions &quot;changed the complexion of the pop and classical music worlds.&quot; Moog&#x27;s name became so associated with electronic music that it was sometimes used as a generic term for any synthesizer.

Moog&#x27;s awards include honorary doctorates from Polytechnic Institute of New York University (New York City), Lycoming College (Williamsport, Pennsylvania) and Berklee College of Music. He received a Grammy Trustees Award for lifetime achievement in 1970, the Polar Music Prize in 2001 and a Special Merit/Technical Grammy Award in 2002. In 2012, to celebrate Moog&#x27;s birthday, Google created an interactive version of the Minimoog as its Google Doodle. In 2013, Moog was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

===Museum===

On July 18, 2013, Moog&#x27;s widow Ileana Grams-Moog announced plans to donate Moog&#x27;s archives, maintained by the Bob Moog Foundation, to Cornell University. The foundation offered her $100,000 but Grams-Moog would not sell the archives. She felt that Cornell could provide better access for researchers and that the foundation had not made enough progress toward a planned museum to be worthy of maintaining the collection. The foundation responded that it had sufficiently preserved the collection and had made efforts to improve storage, although it could not yet afford to build the museum.

In August 2019, the Bob Moog Foundation opened the Moogseum, a museum dedicated to Moog&#x27;s work, in Asheville, North Carolina. The displays include rare theremins, prototype synthesizer modules and Moog&#x27;s documents.

Moog has been the subject of books about his life and work, including the 2004 book &quot;Analog Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer&quot; by Trevor Pinch and Frank Trocco and the 2023 biography &quot;Switched On: Bob Moog and the Synthesizer Revolution&quot; by Albert Glinsky. Moog had contributed the foreword to Glinsky&#x27;s first book, &quot;Theremin: Ether Music and Espionage,&quot; about Leon Theremin, who was a principal inspiration to Moog.

Moog was also the subject of &quot;Moog&quot;, a 2004 documentary directed by Hans Fjellestad, who said that Moog &quot;embodies the archetypal American maverick inventor.&quot;

<text>Robert I (11 July 1274 – 7 June 1329), popularly known as Robert the Bruce (), was King of Scots from 1306 until his death in 1329. Robert led Scotland during the First War of Scottish Independence against England. He fought successfully during his reign to restore Scotland to an independent kingdom and is regarded in Scotland as a national hero.

Robert was a fourth-great-grandson of King David I, and his grandfather, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, was one of the claimants to the Scottish throne during the &quot;Great Cause&quot;.

As Earl of Carrick, Robert the Bruce supported his family&#x27;s claim to the Scottish throne and took part in William Wallace&#x27;s revolt against Edward I of England. Appointed in 1298 as a Guardian of Scotland alongside his chief rival for the throne, John Comyn of Badenoch, and William Lamberton, Bishop of St Andrews, Robert resigned in 1300 because of his quarrels with Comyn and the apparently imminent restoration of John Balliol to the Scottish throne. After submitting to Edward I in 1302 and returning to &quot;the king&#x27;s peace&quot;, Robert inherited his family&#x27;s claim to the Scottish throne upon his father&#x27;s death.

Bruce&#x27;s involvement in John Comyn&#x27;s murder in February 1306 led to his excommunication by Pope Clement V (although he received absolution from Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow). Bruce moved quickly to seize the throne and was crowned king of Scots on 25 March 1306. Edward I&#x27;s forces defeated Robert in the Battle of Methven, forcing him to flee into hiding, before re-emerging in 1307 to defeat an English army at Loudoun Hill and wage a highly successful guerrilla war against the English.

Robert I defeated his other opponents, destroying their strongholds and devastating their lands, and in 1309 held his first parliament. A series of military victories between 1310 and 1314 won him control of much of Scotland, and at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, Robert defeated a much larger English army under Edward II of England, confirming the re-establishment of an independent Scottish kingdom. The battle marked a significant turning point, with Robert&#x27;s armies now free to launch devastating raids throughout northern England, while he also expanded the war against England by sending armies to invade Ireland, and appealed to the Irish to rise against Edward II&#x27;s rule.

Despite Bannockburn and the capture of the final English stronghold at Berwick in 1318, Edward II refused to renounce his claim to the overlordship of Scotland. In 1320, the Scottish nobility submitted the Declaration of Arbroath to Pope John XXII, declaring Robert as their rightful monarch and asserting Scotland&#x27;s status as an independent kingdom.

In 1324, the Pope recognised Robert I as king of an independent Scotland, and in 1326, the Franco-Scottish alliance was renewed in the Treaty of Corbeil. In 1327, the English deposed Edward II in favour of his son, Edward III, and peace was concluded between Scotland and England with the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton in 1328, by which Edward III renounced all claims to sovereignty over Scotland.

Robert I died in June 1329 and was succeeded by his son, David II. Robert&#x27;s body is buried in Dunfermline Abbey, while his heart was interred in Melrose Abbey, and his internal organs were embalmed and placed in St Serf&#x27;s Church, Dumbarton.

== Early life (1274–1292) ==
=== Birth ===
Robert the Bruce was born on 11 July 1274. His place of birth is not known for certain. It most likely was Turnberry Castle in Ayrshire, the head of his mother&#x27;s earldom, despite claims that he may have been born in Lochmaben in Dumfriesshire, or Writtle in Essex. Robert de Brus, 1st Lord of Annandale, the first of the Bruce (de Brus) line, had settled in Scotland during the reign of King David I, and was granted the Lordship of Annandale in 1124. The future king was one of ten children, and the eldest son, of Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale, and Marjorie, Countess of Carrick. From his mother, he inherited the Earldom of Carrick, and through his father, the Lordship of Annandale and a royal lineage as a fourth great-grandson of David I that would give him a claim to the Scottish throne. In addition to the lordship of Annandale, the Bruces also held lands in Aberdeenshire and Dundee, and substantial estates in England (in Cumberland, County Durham, Essex, Middlesex, Northumberland and Yorkshire) and in County Antrim in Ireland.

=== Childhood ===
Very little is known of his youth. He was probably brought up in a mixture of the Anglo-Norman culture of northern England and south-eastern Scotland, and the Gaelic culture of southwest Scotland and most of Scotland north of the River Forth. Annandale was thoroughly feudalised, and the form of Northern Middle English that would later develop into the Scots language was spoken throughout the region. Carrick was historically an integral part of Galloway, and though the earls of Carrick had achieved some feudalisation, the society of Carrick at the end of the thirteenth century remained emphatically Celtic and Gaelic speaking.

Robert the Bruce would most probably have become trilingual at an early age. He would have been schooled to speak, read and possibly write in the Anglo-Norman language of his Scots-Norman peers and the Scoto-Norman portion of his family. He would also have spoken both the Gaelic language of his Carrick birthplace and his mother&#x27;s family and the early Scots language. As the heir to a considerable estate and a pious layman, Robert would also have been given working knowledge of Latin, the language of charter lordship, liturgy and prayer. This would have afforded Robert and his brothers access to basic education in the law, politics, scripture, saints&#x27; Lives (&quot;vitae&quot;), philosophy, history and chivalric instruction and romance.

Barbour reported that Robert read aloud to his band of supporters in 1306, reciting from memory tales from a twelfth-century romance of Charlemagne, &quot;Fierabras&quot;, as well as relating examples from history such as Hannibal&#x27;s defiance of Rome.

As king, Robert certainly commissioned verse to commemorate Bannockburn and his subjects&#x27; military deeds. Contemporary chroniclers Jean Le Bel and Thomas Grey would both assert that they had read a history of his reign &#x27;commissioned by King Robert himself.&#x27; In his last years, Robert would pay for Dominican friars to tutor his son, David, for whom he would also purchase books. A parliamentary briefing document of c. 1364 would also assert that Robert &#x27;used continually to read, or have read in his presence, the histories of ancient kings and princes, and how they conducted themselves in their times, both in wartime and in peacetime; from these he derived information about aspects of his own rule.&#x27;

Tutors for the young Robert and his brothers were most likely drawn from unbeneficed clergy or mendicant friars associated with the churches patronised by their family. However, as growing noble youths, outdoor pursuits and great events would also have held a strong fascination for Robert and his brothers. They would have had masters drawn from their parents&#x27; household to school them in the arts of horsemanship, swordsmanship, the joust, hunting and perhaps aspects of courtly behaviour, including dress, protocol, speech, table etiquette, music and dance, some of which may have been learned before the age of ten while serving as pages in their father&#x27;s or grandfather&#x27;s household.

As many of these personal and leadership skills were bound up within a code of chivalry, Robert&#x27;s chief tutor was surely a reputable, experienced knight, drawn from his grandfather&#x27;s crusade retinue. This grandfather, known to contemporaries as Robert the Noble, and to history as &quot;Bruce the Competitor&quot;, seems to have been an immense influence on the future king. Robert&#x27;s later performance in war certainly underlines his skills in tactics and single combat.

The family would have moved between the castles of their lordshipsLochmaben Castle, the main castle of the lordship of Annandale, and Turnberry and Loch Doon Castle, the castles of the earldom of Carrick. A significant and profound part of the childhood experience of Robert, Edward and possibly the other Bruce brothers (Neil, Thomas and Alexander), was also gained through the Gaelic tradition of being fostered to allied Gaelic kindreds – a traditional practice in Carrick, southwest and western Scotland, the Hebrides and Ireland.

There were a number of Carrick, Ayrshire, Hebridean and Irish families and kindreds affiliated with the Bruces who might have performed such a service (Robert&#x27;s foster brother is referred to by Barbour as sharing Robert&#x27;s precarious existence as an outlaw in Carrick in 1307–1308). This Gaelic influence has been cited as a possible explanation for Robert the Bruce&#x27;s apparent affinity for &quot;hobelar&quot; warfare, using smaller sturdy ponies in mounted raids, as well as for sea-power, ranging from oared war-galleys (&quot;birlinns&quot;) to boats.

According to historians such as Barrow and Penman, it is also likely that when Robert and Edward Bruce reached the male age of consent of twelve and began training for full knighthood, they were sent to reside for a period with one or more allied English noble families, such as the de Clares of Gloucester, or perhaps even in the English royal household. Sir Thomas Grey asserted in his &quot;Scalacronica&quot; that in about 1292, Robert the Bruce, then aged eighteen, was a &quot;young bachelor of King Edward&#x27;s Chamber&quot;. While there remains little firm evidence of Robert&#x27;s presence at Edward&#x27;s court, on 8 April 1296, both Robert and his father were pursued through the English Chancery for their private household debts of £60 by several merchants of Winchester. This raises the possibility that young Robert the Bruce was on occasion resident in a royal centre which Edward I himself would visit frequently during his reign.

Robert&#x27;s first appearance in history is on a witness list of a charter issued by Alexander Og MacDonald, Lord of Islay. His name appears in the company of the Bishop of Argyll, the vicar of Arran, a Kintyre clerk, his father, and a host of Gaelic notaries from Carrick. Robert Bruce, the king-to-be, was sixteen years of age when Margaret, Maid of Norway, died in 1290. It was also around this time that Robert would have been knighted, and he began to appear on the political stage in the Bruce dynastic interest.

=== &quot;Great Cause&quot; ===
Robert&#x27;s mother died early in 1292. In November of the same year, Edward I of England, on behalf of the Guardians of Scotland and following the Great Cause, awarded the vacant Crown of Scotland to his grandfather&#x27;s first cousin once removed, John Balliol.

Almost immediately, Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, resigned his lordship of Annandale and transferred his claim to the Scottish throne to his son, antedating this statement to 7 November. In turn, that son, Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale, resigned his earldom of Carrick to his eldest son, Robert, the future king, to protect the Bruce&#x27;s kingship claim while their middle lord (Robert the Bruce&#x27;s father) now held only English lands.

While the Bruces&#x27; bid for the throne had failed, the Balliols&#x27; triumph propelled the eighteen-year-old Robert the Bruce onto the political stage in his own right.

== Earl of Carrick (1292–1306) ==
=== Bruces regroup ===
Even after John&#x27;s accession, Edward continued to assert his authority over Scotland, and relations between the two kings soon deteriorated. The Bruces sided with King Edward against King John and his Comyn allies. Robert the Bruce and his father both considered John a usurper. Against the objections of the Scots, Edward I agreed to hear appeals on cases ruled on by the court of the Guardians that had governed Scotland during the interregnum. A further provocation came in a case brought by Macduff, son of Malcolm, Earl of Fife, in which Edward demanded that John appear in person before the English Parliament to answer the charges. This the Scottish king did, but the final straw was Edward&#x27;s demand that the Scottish magnates provide military service in England&#x27;s war against France. This was unacceptable; the Scots instead formed an alliance with France.

The Comyn-dominated council acting in the name of King John summoned the Scottish host to meet at Caddonlee on 11 March. The Bruces and the earls of Angus and March refused, and the Bruce family withdrew temporarily from Scotland, while the Comyns seized their estates in Annandale and Carrick, granting them to John Comyn, Earl of Buchan. Edward I thereupon provided a safe refuge for the Bruces, having appointed the Lord of Annandale to the command of Carlisle Castle in October 1295. At some point in early 1296, Robert married his first wife, Isabella of Mar, the daughter of Domhnall I, Earl of Mar. Isabella died shortly after their marriage, either during or shortly after the birth of their only child, Marjorie Bruce.

=== Beginning of the Wars of Independence ===
Almost the first blow in the war between Scotland and England was a direct attack on the Bruces. On 26 March 1296, Easter Monday, seven Scottish earls made a surprise attack on the walled city of Carlisle, which was not so much an attack against England as the Comyn Earl of Buchan and their faction attacking their Bruce enemies. Both his father and grandfather were at one time Governors of the Castle, and following the loss of Annandale to Comyn in 1295, it was their principal residence. Robert Bruce would have gained first-hand knowledge of the city&#x27;s defences. The next time Carlisle was besieged, in 1315, Robert the Bruce would lead the attack.

Edward I responded to King John&#x27;s alliance with France and the attack on Carlisle by invading Scotland at the end of March 1296 and taking the town of Berwick in a particularly bloody attack upon the flimsy palisades. At the Battle of Dunbar, Scottish resistance was effectively crushed. Edward deposed King John, placed him in the Tower of London, and installed Englishmen to govern the country. The campaign had been very successful, but the English triumph would be only temporary.

Although the Bruces were by now back in possession of Annandale and Carrick, in August 1296 Robert Bruce, Lord of Annandale, and his son, Robert Bruce, Earl of Carrick and future king, were among the more than 1,500 Scots at Berwick who swore an oath of fealty to King Edward I of England. When the Scottish revolt against Edward I broke out in July 1297, James Stewart, 5th High Steward of Scotland, led into rebellion a group of disaffected Scots, including Robert Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow, Macduff of Fife, and the young Robert Bruce. The future king was now twenty-two, and in joining the rebels he seems to have been acting independently of his father, who took no part in the rebellion and appears to have abandoned Annandale once more for the safety of Carlisle. It appears that Robert Bruce had fallen under the influence of his grandfather&#x27;s friends, Wishart and Stewart, who had inspired him to resistance. With the outbreak of the revolt, Robert left Carlisle and made his way to Annandale, where he called together the knights of his ancestral lands and, according to the English chronicler Walter of Guisborough, addressed them thus:

Urgent letters were sent ordering Bruce to support Edward&#x27;s commander, John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey (to whom Bruce was related), in the summer of 1297; but instead of complying, Bruce continued to support the revolt against Edward I. That Bruce was in the forefront of inciting rebellion is shown in a letter written to Edward by Hugh Cressingham on 23 July 1292, which reports the opinion that &quot;if you had the earl of Carrick, the Steward of Scotland and his brother ... you would think your business done&quot;. On 7 July, Bruce and his friends made terms with Edward by a treaty called the Capitulation of Irvine. The Scottish lords were not to serve beyond the sea against their will and were pardoned for their recent violence in return for swearing allegiance to King Edward. The Bishop of Glasgow, James the Steward, and Sir Alexander Lindsay became sureties for Bruce until he delivered his infant daughter Marjorie as a hostage, which he never did.

When King Edward returned to England after his victory at the Battle of Falkirk, the Bruce&#x27;s possessions were excepted from the Lordships and lands that Edward assigned to his followers. The reason for this is uncertain, though Fordun records Robert fighting for Edward, at Falkirk, under the command of Antony Bek, Bishop of Durham, Annandale and Carrick. This participation is contested as no Bruce appears on the Falkirk roll of nobles present in the English army, and two 19th Century antiquarians, Alexander Murison and George Chalmers, have stated that Bruce did not participate, and in the following month decided to lay waste to Annandale and burn Ayr Castle, to prevent it being garrisoned by the English.

=== Guardian ===
William Wallace resigned as Guardian of Scotland after his defeat at the Battle of Falkirk. He was succeeded by Robert Bruce and John Comyn as joint Guardians, but they could not see past their personal differences. As a nephew and supporter of King John, and as someone with a serious claim to the Scottish throne, Comyn was Bruce&#x27;s enemy. In 1299, William Lamberton, Bishop of St. Andrews, was appointed as a third, neutral Guardian to try to maintain order between Bruce and Comyn. The following year, Bruce finally resigned as joint Guardian and was replaced by Sir Gilbert de Umfraville, Earl of Angus. In May 1301, Umfraville, Comyn, and Lamberton also resigned as joint Guardians and were replaced by Sir John de Soules as sole Guardian. Soules was appointed largely because he was part of neither the Bruce nor the Comyn camps and was a patriot. He was an active Guardian and made renewed efforts to have King John returned to the Scottish throne.

In July 1301 King Edward I launched his sixth campaign into Scotland. Though he captured the castles of Bothwell and Turnberry, he did little to damage the Scots&#x27; fighting ability, and in January 1302 he agreed to a nine-month truce. It was around this time that Robert the Bruce submitted to Edward, along with other nobles, even though he had been on the side of the Scots until then. There were rumours that John Balliol would return to regain the Scottish throne. Soules, who had probably been appointed by John, supported his return, as did most other nobles. But it was no more than a rumour and nothing came of it.

In March 1302, Bruce sent a letter to the monks at Melrose Abbey apologising for having called tenants of the monks to service in his army when there had been no national call-up. Bruce pledged that, henceforth, he would &quot;never again&quot; require the monks to serve unless it was to &quot;the common army of the whole realm&quot;, for national defence. Bruce also married his second wife that year, Elizabeth de Burgh, the daughter of Richard de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster, in Writtle, near Chelmsford in Essex. Elizabeth was about 13 at the time, and Bruce 28. By Elizabeth he had four children: David II, John (died in childhood), Matilda (who married Thomas Isaac and died at Aberdeen 20 July 1353), and Margaret (who married William de Moravia, 5th Earl of Sutherland in 1345).

In 1303, Edward invaded again, reaching Edinburgh before marching to Perth. Edward stayed in Perth until July, then proceeded via Dundee, Brechin, and Montrose to Aberdeen, where he arrived in August. From there he marched through Moray to Badenoch before re-tracing his path back south to Dunfermline. With the country now under submission, all the leading Scots, except for William Wallace, surrendered to Edward in February 1304. John Comyn, who was by now Guardian again, submitted to Edward. The laws and liberties of Scotland were to be as they had been in the days of Alexander III, and any that needed alteration would be with the assent of King Edward and the advice of the Scots nobles.

On 11 June 1304, Bruce and William Lamberton made a pact that bound them, each to the other, in &quot;friendship and alliance against all men.&quot; If one should break the secret pact, he would forfeit to the other the sum of ten thousand pounds. The pact is often interpreted as a sign of their patriotism despite both having already surrendered to the English. Homage was again obtained from the nobles and the burghs, and a parliament was held to elect those who would meet later in the year with the English parliament to establish rules for the governance of Scotland. The Earl of Richmond, Edward&#x27;s nephew, was to head up the subordinate government of Scotland. While all this took place, William Wallace was finally captured near Glasgow, and he was hanged, drawn, and quartered in London on 23 August 1305.

In September 1305, Edward ordered Robert Bruce to put his castle at Kildrummy, &quot;in the keeping of such a man as he himself will be willing to answer for,&quot; suggesting that King Edward suspected Robert was not entirely trustworthy and may have been plotting behind his back. However, an identical phrase appears in an agreement between Edward and his lieutenant and lifelong friend, Aymer de Valence. A further sign of Edward&#x27;s distrust occurred on 10 October 1305, when Edward revoked his gift of Sir Gilbert de Umfraville&#x27;s lands to Bruce that he had made only six months before.

Robert Bruce as Earl of Carrick, and now 7th Lord of Annandale, held huge estates and property in Scotland and a barony and some minor properties in England, and a strong claim to the Scottish throne.

=== Murder of John Comyn ===
Bruce, like all his family, had a complete belief in his right to the throne. His ambition was further thwarted by John Comyn, who supported John Balliol. Comyn was the most powerful noble in Scotland and was related to many other powerful nobles both within Scotland and England, including relatives that held the earldoms of Buchan, Mar, Ross, Fife, Angus, Dunbar, and Strathearn; the Lordships of Kilbride, Kirkintilloch, Lenzie, Bedrule, and Scraesburgh; and sheriffdoms in Banff, Dingwall, Wigtown, and Aberdeen. He also had a powerful claim to the Scottish throne through his descent from Donald III on his father&#x27;s side and David I on his mother&#x27;s side. Comyn was the nephew of John Balliol.

According to Barbour and Fordoun, in the late summer of 1305, in a secret agreement sworn, signed, and sealed, John Comyn agreed to forfeit his claim to the Scottish throne in favour of Robert Bruce upon receipt of the Bruce lands in Scotland should an uprising occur led by Bruce. Whether the details of the agreement with Comyn are correct or not, King Edward moved to arrest Bruce while Bruce was still at the English court. Ralph de Monthermer learned of Edward&#x27;s intention and warned Bruce by sending him twelve pence and a pair of spurs. Bruce took the hint, and he and a squire fled the English court during the night. They made their way quickly for Scotland.

According to Barbour, Comyn betrayed his agreement with Bruce to King Edward I, and when Bruce arranged a meeting for 10 February 1306 with Comyn in the Chapel of Greyfriars Monastery in Dumfries and accused him of treachery, they came to blows. Bruce stabbed Comyn before the high altar. The &quot;Scotichronicon&quot; says that on being told that Comyn had survived the attack and was being treated, two of Bruce&#x27;s supporters, Roger de Kirkpatrick (uttering the words &quot;I mak siccar&quot; (&quot;I make sure&quot;)) and John Lindsay, went back into the church and finished Bruce&#x27;s work. Barbour, however, tells no such story. The Flores Historiarum, which was written c. 1307, says Bruce and Comyn disagreed and Bruce drew his sword and struck Comyn over the head. Bruce supporters then ran up and stabbed Comyn with their swords. Bruce asserted his claim to the Scottish crown and began his campaign by force for the independence of Scotland.

Bruce and his party then attacked Dumfries Castle where the English garrison surrendered. Bruce hurried from Dumfries to Glasgow, where his friend and supporter Bishop Robert Wishart granted him absolution and subsequently adjured the clergy throughout the land to rally to Bruce. Nonetheless, Bruce was excommunicated for this crime.

== Early reign (1306–1314) ==
=== Coronation ===
Six weeks after Comyn was killed in Dumfries, Bruce was crowned King of Scots by Bishop William de Lamberton at Scone, near Perth, on Palm Sunday 25 March 1306 with all formality and solemnity. The royal robes and vestments that Robert Wishart had hidden from the English were brought out by the bishop and set upon King Robert. The bishops of Moray and Glasgow were in attendance, as were the earls of Atholl, Menteith, the Lennox and Mar. The great banner of the kings of Scotland was planted behind Bruce&#x27;s throne. The following day, he agreed to be crowned for a second time by Isabella MacDuff, Countess of Buchan, as according to tradition, the crowning ceremony was performed by a representative of Clan MacDuff.

=== War of Robert the Bruce ===
Edward I marched north again in the spring of 1306. On his way, he granted the Scottish estates of Bruce and his adherents to his own followers and had published a bill excommunicating Bruce. In June Bruce was defeated at the Battle of Methven. His wife and daughters and other women of the party were sent to Kildrummy in August under the protection of Bruce&#x27;s brother, Neil Bruce, and the Earl of Atholl and most of his remaining men. Bruce fled with a small following of his most faithful men, including Sir James Douglas and Gilbert Hay, Bruce&#x27;s brothers Thomas, Alexander, and Edward, as well as Sir Neil Campbell and the Earl of Lennox.

A strong force under Edward, Prince of Wales, captured Kildrummy Castle on 13 September 1306, taking prisoner the King&#x27;s youngest brother, Nigel de Bruce, as well as Robert Boyd and Alexander Lindsay, and Sir Simon Fraser. Boyd managed to escape but both Nigel de Bruce and Lindsay were executed shortly after at Berwick following King Edward&#x27;s orders to execute all followers of Robert de Bruce. Fraser was taken to London to suffer the same fate. Shortly before the fall of Kildrummy Castle, the Earl of Atholl made a desperate attempt to take Queen Elizabeth de Burgh, Margery de Bruce, as well as King Robert&#x27;s sisters and Isabella of Fife. They were betrayed a few days later and also fell into English hands, Atholl to be executed in London and the women to be held under the harshest possible circumstances.

It is still uncertain where Bruce spent the winter of 1306–1307. Most likely he spent it in the Hebrides, possibly sheltered by Christina of the Isles. The latter was married to a member of the Mar kindred, a family to which Bruce was related (not only was his first wife a member of this family but her brother, Gartnait, was married to a sister of Bruce). Ireland is also a serious possibility, and Orkney (under Norwegian rule at the time) or Norway proper (where his sister Isabel Bruce was queen dowager) are unlikely but not impossible. Bruce and his followers returned to the Scottish mainland in February 1307 in two groups. One, led by Bruce and his brother Edward, landed at Turnberry Castle and began a guerrilla war in southwest Scotland. The other, led by his brothers Thomas and Alexander, landed slightly further south in Loch Ryan, but they were soon captured and executed. In April, Bruce won a small victory over the English at the Battle of Glen Trool, before defeating Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, at the Battle of Loudoun Hill. At the same time, James Douglas made his first foray for Bruce into southwestern Scotland, attacking and burning his own castle in Douglasdale. Leaving his brother Edward in command in Galloway, Bruce travelled north, capturing Inverlochy and Urquhart Castles, burning to the ground Inverness Castle and Nairn, then unsuccessfully threatening Elgin. On 7 July 1307, King Edward I died, leaving Bruce opposed by the king&#x27;s son, Edward II.

Transferring operations to Aberdeenshire in late 1307, Bruce threatened Banff before falling seriously ill, probably owing to the hardships of the lengthy campaign. Recovering, leaving John Comyn, 3rd Earl of Buchan unsubdued at his rear, Bruce returned west to take Balvenie and Duffus Castles, then Tarradale Castle on the Black Isle. Looping back via the hinterlands of Inverness and a second failed attempt to take Elgin, Bruce finally achieved his landmark defeat of Comyn at the Battle of Inverurie in May 1308; he then overran Buchan and defeated the English garrison at Aberdeen. The Harrying of Buchan in 1308 was ordered by Bruce to make sure all Comyn family support was extinguished. Buchan had a very large population because it was the agricultural capital of northern Scotland, and much of its population was loyal to the Comyn family even after the defeat of the Earl of Buchan. Most of the Comyn castles in Moray, Aberdeen and Buchan were destroyed and their inhabitants killed. In less than a year Bruce had swept through the north and destroyed the power of the Comyns who had held vice-regal power in the north for nearly one hundred years. How this dramatic success was achieved, especially the taking of northern castles so quickly, is difficult to understand. Bruce lacked siege weapons and it&#x27;s unlikely his army had substantially greater numbers or was better armed than his opponents. The morale and leadership of the Comyns and their northern allies appeared to be inexplicably lacking in the face of their direct challenge. He then crossed to Argyll and defeated the isolated MacDougalls (allies of the Comyns) at the Battle of Pass of Brander and took Dunstaffnage Castle, the last major stronghold of the Comyns and their allies. Bruce then ordered harryings in Argyle and Kintyre, in the territories of Clan MacDougall.

In March 1309, Bruce held his first parliament at St. Andrews and by August he controlled all of Scotland north of the River Tay. The following year, the clergy of Scotland recognised Bruce as king at a general council. The support given him by the church, in spite of his excommunication, was of great political importance. On 1 October 1310, Bruce wrote Edward II of England from Kildrum in Cumbernauld Parish in an unsuccessful attempt to establish peace between Scotland and England. Over the next three years, one English-held castle or outpost after another was captured and reduced: Linlithgow in 1310, Dumbarton in 1311, and Perth, by Bruce himself, in January 1312. Bruce also made raids into northern England and, landing at Ramsey in the Isle of Man, laid siege to Castle Rushen in Castletown, capturing it on 21 June 1313 and denying the English the island&#x27;s strategic importance.

The eight years of exhausting but deliberate refusal to meet the English on even ground have caused many to consider Bruce one of the great guerrilla leaders of any age. This represented a transformation for one raised as a feudal knight.

=== Battle of Bannockburn ===
By 1314, Bruce had recaptured most of the castles in Scotland held by the English and was sending raiding parties into northern England as far as Carlisle. In response, Edward II planned a major military campaign with the support of Lancaster and the barons, mustering a large army of between 15,000 and 20,000 men. In the spring of 1314, Edward Bruce laid siege to Stirling Castle, a key fortification in Scotland whose governor, Philip de Mowbray, agreed to surrender if not relieved before 24 June 1314. In March, James Douglas captured Roxburgh, and Randolph captured Edinburgh Castle (Bruce later ordered the execution of Piers de Lombard, governor of the castle), while in May, Bruce again raided England and subdued the Isle of Man. News of the agreement regarding Stirling Castle reached the English king in late May, and he decided to speed his march north from Berwick to relieve the castle. Robert, with between 5,500 and 6,500 troops, predominantly spearmen, prepared to prevent Edward&#x27;s forces from reaching Stirling.

The battle began on 23 June as the English army attempted to force its way across the high ground of the Bannock Burn, which was surrounded by marshland. Skirmishing between the two sides broke out, resulting in the death of Sir Henry de Bohun, whom Robert killed in personal combat. Edward continued his advance the following day and encountered the bulk of the Scottish army as they emerged from the woods of New Park. The English appear not to have expected the Scots to give battle here, and as a result had kept their forces in marching, rather than battle, order, with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − at the back, rather than the front, of the army. The English cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by Robert&#x27;s spearmen. The English army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control.

Edward II was dragged from the battlefield, hotly pursued by the Scottish forces, and only just escaped the heavy fighting. The historian Roy Haines describes the defeat as a &quot;calamity of stunning proportions&quot; for the English, whose losses were huge. In the aftermath of the defeat, Edward retreated to Dunbar, then travelled by ship to Berwick, and then back to York; in his absence, Stirling Castle quickly fell.

==Mid-reign (1314–1320)==
=== Further confrontation with England then the Irish conflict ===

Freed from English threats, Scotland&#x27;s armies could now invade northern England. Bruce also drove back a subsequent English expedition north of the border and launched raids into Yorkshire and Lancashire. Buoyed by his military successes, Robert also sent his brother Edward to invade Ireland in 1315, in an attempt to secure a second crown (having received a reply to offers of assistance from Domhnall Ó Néill, king of Tír Eoghain), and to open a second front in the continuing wars with England. Edward was even crowned as High King of Ireland in 1316. Robert later went there with another army to assist his brother.

In conjunction with the invasion, Bruce popularised an ideological vision of a &quot;Pan-Gaelic Greater Scotia&quot; with his lineage ruling over both Ireland and Scotland. This propaganda campaign was aided by two factors. The first was the betrayal of Robert&#x27;s marriage alliance, of 1302, with the Richard Óg de Burgh, 2nd Earl of Ulster, Robert&#x27;s second wife being the 13-year-old daughter of Richard, Elizabeth de Burgh, though despite the marriage Richard sided with Edward following Comyn&#x27;s 1305 murder; second, Bruce himself, on his mother&#x27;s side of Carrick, was descended from Gaelic royalty in Scotland as well as Ireland. Bruce&#x27;s Irish ancestors included Aoife of Leinster (d. 1188), whose ancestors included Brian Boru of Munster and the kings of Leinster. Thus, lineally and geopolitically, Bruce attempted to support his anticipated notion of a pan-Gaelic alliance between Scottish-Irish Gaelic populations, under his kingship. This is revealed by a letter he sent to the Irish chiefs, where he calls the Scots and Irish collectively &quot;nostra nacio&quot; (our nation), stressing the common language, customs and heritage of the two peoples:

The diplomacy worked to a certain extent, at least in Ulster, where the Scots had some support. The Irish chief, Domhnall Ó Néill, for instance, later justified his support for the Scots to Pope John XXII by saying &quot;the Kings of Lesser Scotia all trace their blood to our &quot;Greater Scotia&quot; and retain to some degree our language and customs.&quot;

Initially, the Scot-Irish army seemed unstoppable as they defeated the Hiberno-Norman forces of Richard De Burgh, Robert&#x27;s father-in-law and Earl of Ulster, Edward&#x27;s army levelling his hiberno-norman towns. However, the Scots failed to win over the non-Ulster chiefs or to make any other significant gains in the south of the island, where people couldn&#x27;t see the difference between Hiberno-Norman and Scottish occupation. This was because a famine struck Ireland and the army struggled to sustain itself. They resorted to pillaging and razing entire settlements as they searched for supplies, regardless of whether they were Hiberno-Norman or Irish. Eventually it was defeated when Edward Bruce was killed at the Battle of Faughart, by an army led by Richard de Burgh. The Irish Annals of the period described the defeat of the Bruces by the Hiberno-Normans as one of the greatest things ever done for the Irish nation due to the fact it brought an end to the famine and pillaging wrought upon the Irish by both the Scots and the Hiberno-Normans. For his campaigns against the English Crown Robert and his adherents,1306, excommunication, of Pope Clement V, was reaffirmed, in 1318, by Pope John XXII. 

== Later reign (1320–1329) ==
The reign of Robert Bruce also included some significant diplomatic achievements. The Declaration of Arbroath of 1320 strengthened his position, particularly in relation to the Papacy, and Pope John XXII eventually lifted Bruce&#x27;s excommunication. In May 1328 King Edward III of England signed the Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton, which recognised Scotland as an independent kingdom, and Bruce as its king.

In 1325 Robert I acquired lands at Cardross in exchange for those of Old Montros in Angus, Scotland, with Sir David Graham. It was to be here in Cardoss that Robert would build the manor house that would serve as his favoured residence during the final years of his reign. The extant chamberlain&#x27;s accounts for 1328 detail a manor house at Cardross with king&#x27;s and queen&#x27;s chambers and glazed windows, a chapel, kitchens, bake- and brew-houses, falcon aviary, medicinal garden, gatehouse, protective moat and a hunting park. There was also a jetty and beaching area for the &#x27;king&#x27;s coble&#x27; (for fishing) alongside the &quot;king&#x27;s great ship&quot;. As most of mainland Scotland&#x27;s major royal castles had remained in their razed state since around 1313–1314, Cardross manor was perhaps built as a modest residence sympathetic to Robert&#x27;s subjects&#x27; privations through a long war, repeated famines and livestock pandemics. Before Cardross became habitable in 1327, Robert&#x27;s main residence had been Scone Abbey.

Robert had been suffering from a serious illness since at least 1327. The &quot;Lanercost Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Scalacronica&quot; state that the king was said to have contracted and died of leprosy. Jean Le Bel also stated that in 1327 the king was a victim of &#x27;la grosse maladie&#x27;, which is usually taken to mean leprosy. However, the ignorant use of the term &#x27;leprosy&#x27; by fourteenth-century writers meant that almost any major skin disease might be called leprosy. The earliest mention of this illness is to be found in an original letter written by an eyewitness in Ulster at the time the king made a truce with Sir Henry Mandeville on 12 July 1327. The writer of this letter reported that Robert was so feeble and struck down by illness that he would not live, &#x27;for he can scarcely move anything but his tongue&#x27;. However, none of the several accounts of his last years by people who were with him refer to any sign of a skin ailment. Barbour writes of the king&#x27;s illness that &quot;it began through a benumbing brought on by his cold lying&quot;, during the months of wandering from 1306 to 1309. It has been proposed alternatively that he had eczema, tuberculosis, syphilis, motor neuron disease, cancer or a series of strokes. There does not seem to be any evidence as to what the king himself or his physicians believed his illness to be. Nor is there any evidence of an attempt in his last years to segregate the king in any way from the company of friends, family, courtiers, or foreign diplomats.

In October 1328 the Pope finally lifted the interdict from Scotland and the excommunication of Robert. The king&#x27;s last journey appears to have been a pilgrimage to the shrine of Saint Ninian at Whithorn; this was possibly in search of a miraculous cure, or to make his peace with God. With Moray by his side, Robert set off from his manor at Cardross for Tarbert on his &#x27;great ship&#x27;, thence to the Isle of Arran, where he celebrated Christmas of 1328 at the hall of Glenkill near Lamlash. Thence he sailed to the mainland to visit his son and his bride, both mere children, now installed at Turnberry Castle, the head of the earldom of Carrick and once his own main residence. He journeyed overland, being carried on a litter, to Inch in Wigtownshire: houses were built there, and supplies brought to that place, as though the king&#x27;s condition had deteriorated. At the end of March 1329, he was staying at Glenluce Abbey and at Monreith, from where St Ninian&#x27;s Cave was visited. Early in April, he arrived at the shrine of St Ninian at Whithorn. He fasted four or five days and prayed to the saint, before returning by sea to Cardross.

Barbour and other sources relate that Robert summoned his prelates and barons to his bedside for a final council at which he made copious gifts to religious houses, dispensed silver to religious foundations of various orders, so that they might pray for his soul, and repented of his failure to fulfil a vow to undertake a crusade to fight the &#x27;Saracens&#x27; in the Holy Land. Robert&#x27;s final wish reflected conventional piety, and was perhaps intended to perpetuate his memory. After his death his heart was to be removed from his body and, accompanied by a company of knights led by Sir James Douglas, taken on pilgrimage to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem before being interred in Melrose Abbey upon its return from the Holy Land:

Robert also arranged for perpetual soul masses to be funded at the chapel of Saint Serf, at Ayr and at the Dominican friary in Berwick, as well as at Dunfermline Abbey.

== Death (1329) ==
=== Death and aftermath ===
Robert died on 7 June 1329, at the Manor of Cardross, near Dumbarton. Apart from failing to fulfill a vow to undertake a crusade he died utterly fulfilled, in that the goal of his lifetime&#x27;s struggle – untrammelled recognition of the Bruce right to the crown – had been realised, and confident that he was leaving the kingdom of Scotland safely in the hands of his most trusted lieutenant, Moray until his infant son reached adulthood. Six days after his death, to complete his triumph still further, papal bulls were issued granting the privilege of unction at the coronation of future Kings of Scots.

It remains unclear just what caused the death of Robert, a month before his fifty-fifth birthday. Contemporary accusations that Robert had leprosy, the &quot;unclean sickness&quot; – the present-day, treatable Hansen&#x27;s disease – derived from English and Hainault chroniclers. None of the Scottish accounts of his death hint at leprosy. Penman states that it is very difficult to accept the notion of Robert as a functioning king serving in war, performing face-to-face acts of lordship, holding parliament and court, travelling widely and fathering several children, all while displaying the infectious symptoms of a leper. Along with suggestions of eczema, tuberculosis, syphilis, motor neurone disease, cancer or stroke, a diet of rich court food has also been suggested as a possible contributory factor in Robert&#x27;s death. His Milanese physician, Maino De Maineri, did criticise the king&#x27;s eating of eels as dangerous to his health in advancing years.

A team of researchers, headed by Professor Andrew Nelson from University of Western Ontario have determined that Robert the Bruce did not have leprosy. They examined the original casting of the skull belonging to Robert the Bruce&#x27;s descendant Lord Andrew Douglas Alexander Thomas Bruce, and a foot bone that had not been re-interred. They determined that the skull and foot bone showed no signs of leprosy, such as an eroded nasal spine and a pencilling of the foot bone.

=== Burial ===
The king&#x27;s body was embalmed, and his sternum sawn open to allow extraction of the heart, which Sir James Douglas placed in a silver casket to be worn on a chain around his neck. Robert&#x27;s viscera were interred in the chapel of Saint Serf (the ruins of which are located in the present-day Levengrove Park in Dumbarton), his regular place of worship and close to his manor house in the ancient Parish of Cardross. The king&#x27;s body was carried east from Cardross by a carriage decked in black lawn cloth, with stops recorded at Dunipace and Cambuskenneth Abbey. The funeral was a grand affair, with of wax having been purchased for the making of funerary candles. A file of mourners on foot, including Robert Stewart and a number of knights dressed in black gowns, accompanied the funeral party into Dunfermline Abbey. A canopy chapel or &quot;hearse&quot; of imported Baltic wood was erected over the grave. Robert I&#x27;s body, in a wooden coffin, was then interred within a stone vault beneath the floor, underneath a box tomb of white Italian marble purchased in Paris by Thomas of Chartres after June 1328. A plinth of black Frosterley Marble topped this structure, and atop this plinth was a white shawl alabaster effigy of Robert I, painted and gilded. The following Latin epitaph was inscribed around the top of the tomb: &quot;Hic jacet invictus Robertus Rex benedictus qui sua gesta legit repetit quot bella peregit ad libertatem perduxit per probitatem regnum scottorum: nunc vivat in arce polorum&quot; (&quot;Here lies the invincible blessed King Robert / Whoever reads about his feats will repeat the many battles he fought / By his integrity he guided to liberty the Kingdom of the Scots: May he now live in Heaven&quot;). Ten alabaster fragments from the tomb are on display in the National Museum of Scotland and traces of gilding still remain on some of them. Robert had bequeathed sufficient funds to pay for thousands of obituary masses in Dunfermline Abbey and elsewhere, and his tomb would thus be the site of daily votive prayers.

Bruce&#x27;s dying wish was that his heart should be taken to the Holy Land. When a projected international crusade failed to materialise, Sir James Douglas and his company, escorting the casket containing Bruce&#x27;s heart, sailed to Spain where Alfonso XI of Castile was mounting a campaign against the Moorish kingdom of Granada. According to John Barbour, Douglas and his companions, including Sir William de Keith, Sir William St. Clair of Rosslyn and the brothers Sir Robert Logan of Restalrig and Sir Walter Logan, were welcomed cordially by King Alfonso. In August 1330 the Scots contingent formed part of the Castilian army besieging the frontier castle of Teba. Under circumstances which are still disputed, Sir James and most of his companions were killed. The sources all agree that, outnumbered and separated from the main Christian army, a group of Scots knights led by Douglas was overwhelmed and wiped out. John Barbour describes how the surviving members of the company recovered Douglas&#x27; body together with the casket containing Bruce&#x27;s heart. The heart, together with Douglas&#x27; bones, was then brought back to Scotland, where it was buried at Melrose Abbey in Roxburghshire. 
In 1920, what appeared to be King Robert&#x27;s heart was discovered by archaeologists and was reburied, but the location was not marked. In 1996, a casket was unearthed during construction work. Scientific study by AOC archaeologists in Edinburgh demonstrated that it did indeed contain human tissue and it was of appropriate age. It was reburied in Melrose Abbey in 1998, according to the dying wishes of the King.

=== Discovery of the Bruce&#x27;s tomb ===

During the Scottish Reformation, the abbey church had undergone a first Protestant &quot;cleansing&quot; by September 1559 and was sacked in March 1560. By September 1563 the choir and feretory chapel were roofless, and it was said that the nave was also in a sorry state, with the walls so extensively damaged that it was a danger to enter. In 1672 parts of the east end collapsed, while in 1716 part of the central tower is said to have fallen, presumably destabilising much that still stood around its base, and the east gable tumbled in 1726. The final collapse of the central tower took place in 1753.

On 17 February 1818, workmen breaking ground on the new parish church to be built on the site of the choir of Dunfermline Abbey uncovered a vault before the site of the former abbey high altar. The vault was covered by two large, flat stones – one forming a headstone, and a larger stone in length, with six iron rings or handles set in it. When these stones were removed, the vault was found to be in length, wide and deep. Within the vault, inside the remnants of a decayed oak coffin, there was a body entirely enclosed in lead, with a decayed shroud of cloth of gold over it. Over the head of the body, the lead was formed into the shape of a crown. Fragments of marble and alabaster had been found in the debris around the site of the vault several years earlier, which were linked to Robert the Bruce&#x27;s recorded purchase of a marble and alabaster tomb made in Paris.

The Barons of Exchequer ordered that the vault was to be secured from all further inspection with new stones and iron bars and guarded by the town constables and that once the walls of the new church were built up around the site, an investigation of the vault and the remains could take place. Accordingly, on 5 November 1819, the investigation took place. The cloth of gold shroud and the lead covering were found to be in a rapid state of decay since the vault had first been opened 21 months earlier. The body was raised up and placed on a wooden coffin board on the edge of the vault. It was found to be covered in two thin layers of lead, each around thick. The lead was removed and the skeleton was inspected by James Gregory and Alexander Monro, Professor of Anatomy at the University of Edinburgh. The sternum was found to have been sawn open from top to bottom, permitting removal of the king&#x27;s heart after death. A plaster cast was taken of the detached skull by artist William Scoular. The bones were measured and drawn, and the king&#x27;s skeleton was measured to be . It has been estimated that Bruce stood at around tall as a young man, which by medieval standards was impressive. At this height he would have stood almost as tall as Edward I ().

The skeleton, lying on the wooden coffin board, was then placed upon the top of a lead coffin and the large crowd of curious people who had assembled outside the church were allowed to file past the vault to view the king&#x27;s remains. It was at this point in the proceedings that some small relicsteeth and finger boneswere allegedly removed from the skeleton. The published accounts of eyewitnesses such as Henry Jardine and James Gregory confirm the removal of small objects at this time. Robert the Bruce&#x27;s remains were ceremonially re-interred in the vault in Dunfermline Abbey on 5 November 1819. They were placed in a new lead coffin, into which was poured 1,500 lbs of molten pitch to preserve the remains before the coffin was sealed.

Reconstructions of the face of Robert the Bruce have been produced, including those by Richard Neave from the University of Manchester, Peter Vanezis from the University of Glasgow and Dr Martin McGregor (University of Glasgow) and Prof Caroline Wilkinson (Face Lab at Liverpool John Moores University).

== Issue ==
Bruce&#x27;s descendants include all later Scottish monarchs and all British monarchs since the Union of the Crowns in 1603. A large number of families definitely are descended from him.

== Ancestry ==
Descended from the Scoto-Norman, Hiberno-Norman, Irish and Scottish Gaelic nobilities, through his father he was a fourth-great-grandson of David I, as well as claiming ancestry ultimately descended from Aoife MacMurrough and Richard (Strongbow) de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, King of Leinster and Governor of Ireland and William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke. As well as Henry I of England amongst his paternal ancestors. Robert&#x27;s grandfather Robert de Brus, 5th Lord of Annandale, was one of the claimants to the Scottish throne during the &quot;Great Cause&quot;.

== Legacy ==
=== Commemoration and monuments ===
Robert I was originally buried in Dunfermline Abbey, the traditional resting place of Scottish monarchs since the reign of Malcolm Canmore. His tomb, imported from Paris, was extremely elaborate, carved from gilded alabaster. It was destroyed at the Reformation, but some fragments were discovered in the 19th century (now in the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh).

The site of the tomb in Dunfermline Abbey was marked by large carved stone letters spelling out &quot;King Robert the Bruce&quot; around the top of the bell tower when the eastern half of the abbey church was rebuilt in the first half of the 19th century. In 1974 the Bruce Memorial Window was installed in the north transept, commemorating the 700th anniversary of the year of his birth. It depicts stained glass images of the Bruce flanked by his chief men, Christ, and saints associated with Scotland.

A 1929 statue of Robert the Bruce is set in the wall of Edinburgh Castle at the entrance, along with one of Sir William Wallace. In Edinburgh also, the Scottish National Portrait Gallery has statues of Bruce and Wallace in niches flanking the main entrance. The building also contains several frescos depicting scenes from Scots history by William Brassey Hole in the entrance foyer, including a large example of Bruce marshalling his men at Bannockburn.

A bust of Bruce is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling.

A statue of Robert Bruce stands in the High Street in Lochmaben and another in Annan (erected 2010) in front of the town&#x27;s Victorian hall.

An annual commemorative dinner has been held in his honour in Stirling since 2006.

Swords inscribed with Robert&#x27;s name probably date from the 16th century rather than earlier. There is one in the Wallace Collection and a missing one in Ireland.

=== Legends ===
According to a legend, at some point, while he was on the run after the 1306 Battle of Methven, Bruce hid in a cave where he observed a spider spinning a web, trying to make a connection from one area of the cave&#x27;s roof to another. It tried and failed twice, but began again and succeeded on the third attempt. Inspired by this, Bruce returned to inflict a series of defeats on the English, thus winning him more supporters and eventual victory. The story serves to illustrate the maxim: &quot;If at first you don&#x27;t succeed, try try try again&quot;. Other versions have Bruce in a small house watching the spider try to make its connection between two roof beams.


This legend first appears in a much later account, &quot;Tales of a Grandfather&quot; by Walter Scott (published between 1828 and 1830). This may have originally been told about his companion-in-arms Sir James Douglas (the &quot;Black Douglas&quot;), who had spent time hiding out in caves within his manor of Lintalee, which was then occupied by the English. The entire account may in fact be a version of a literary trope used in royal biographical writing. A similar story is told, for example, in Jewish sources about King David, in Polish accounts about Bruce&#x27;s contemporary Władysław I the Elbow-high, and in Persian folklore about the Turco-Mongolian general Tamerlane and an ant.

It is said that before the Battle of Bannockburn, Bruce was attacked by the English Knight Sir Henry de Bohun. Riding with the heavy cavalry, de Bohun caught sight of Bruce, who was armed only with his battle axe. De Bohun lowered his lance and charged, and Bruce stood his ground. At the last moment, Bruce swiftly dodged the lance, rose in his saddle, and with one mighty swing of his axe, struck Bohun so hard that he split de Bohun&#x27;s iron helmet and his head in two, a blow so powerful that it shattered the very weapon into pieces. Afterwards, the King merely expressed regret that he had broken the shaft of his favourite axe. To this day, the story stands in folklore as a testament to the determination of the Scottish people and their culture.

<doc id="26587" wikidata="Q670969" url="?curid=26587" title="Rhythm guitar">
<text>In music performances, rhythm guitar is a technique and role that performs a combination of two functions: to provide all or part of the rhythmic pulse in conjunction with other instruments from the rhythm section (e.g., drum kit, bass guitar); and to provide all or part of the harmony, i.e. the chords from a song&#x27;s chord progression, where a chord is a group of notes played together. Therefore, the basic technique of rhythm guitar is to hold down a series of chords with the fretting hand while strumming or fingerpicking rhythmically with the other hand. More developed rhythm techniques include arpeggios, damping, riffs, chord solos, and complex strums.

In ensembles or bands playing within the acoustic, country, blues, rock or metal genres (among others), a guitarist playing the rhythm part of a composition plays the role of supporting the melodic lines and improvised solos played on the lead instrument or instruments, be they strings, wind, brass, keyboard or even percussion instruments, or simply the human voice, in the sense of playing steadily throughout the piece, whereas lead instruments and singers switch between carrying the main or countermelody and falling silent. In big band music, the guitarist is considered part of the rhythm section, alongside bass and drums.

In some musical situations, such as a solo singer-guitarist, the guitar accompaniment provides all the rhythmic drive; in large ensembles it may be only a small part (perhaps one element in a polyrhythm). Likewise, rhythm guitar can supply all of the harmonic input to a singer-guitarist or small band, but in ensembles that have other harmony instruments (such as keyboards) or vocal harmonists, its harmonic input will be less important.

In the most commercially available and consumed genres, electric guitars tend to dominate their acoustic cousins in both the recording studio and live venues. However the acoustic guitar remains a popular choice in country, western and especially bluegrass music, and almost exclusively in folk music.

==Rock and pop==

===Rock and pop rhythms===
Most rhythms in rock and blues are based on 4/4 time with a backbeat; however, many variations are possible. A backbeat is a syncopated accentuation on the &quot;off&quot; beat. In a simple 4/4 rhythm these are beats 2 and 4. Emphasized back beat, a feature of some African styles, defined rhythm and blues recordings in the late 1940s and so became one of the defining characteristics of rock and roll and much of contemporary popular music.

===Rock and pop harmony===

Harmonically, in rock music, the most common way to construct chord progressions is to play major and minor &quot;triads&quot;, each comprising a root, third and fifth note of a given scale. An example of a major triad is C major, which contains the notes C, E and G. An example of a minor triad is the A minor chord, which includes the notes A, C and E. Interspersed are some four-note chords, which include the root, third and fifth, as well as a sixth, seventh or ninth note of the scale. The most common chord with four different notes is the dominant seventh chord, which include a root, a major third above the root, a perfect fifth above the root and a flattened seventh. In the key of C major, the dominant seventh chord is a G7, which consists of the notes G, B, D and F.

Three-chord progressions are common in earlier pop and rock, using various combinations of the I, IV and V chords, with the twelve-bar blues particularly common. A four chord progression popular in the 1950s is I-vi-ii-V, which in the key of C major is the chords C major, a minor, d minor and G7. Minor and modal chord progressions such as I-bVII-bVI (in the key of E, the chords E major, D major, C major) feature in popular music. 

In heavy metal music, rhythm guitarists often play power chords, which feature a root note and a fifth above, or with an octave doubling the root. There actually is no third of the chord. Power chords are usually played with distortion.

===Arpeggios===
One departure from the basic strummed chord technique is to play arpeggios, i.e. to play individual notes in a chord separately. If this is done rapidly enough, listeners will tend to hear the sequence as harmony rather than melody. Arpeggiation is often used in folk, country, and heavy metal, sometimes in imitation of older banjo techniques. It is also prominent in 1960s pop, such as The Animals&#x27; &quot;House of the Rising Sun&quot;, and jangle pop from the 1980s onwards. Rhythm guitarists who use arpeggios often favor semi-acoustic guitars and twelve string guitars to get a bright, undistorted &quot;jangly&quot; sound.

The Soukous band TPOK Jazz additionally featured the unique role of &quot;mi-solo&quot;, (meaning &quot;half solo&quot;) guitarist, playing arpeggio patterns and filling a role &quot;between&quot; the lead and rhythm guitars.

===Riffs===
In some cases, the chord progression is implied with a simplified sequence of two or three notes, sometimes called a &quot;riff&quot;. That sequence is repeated throughout the composition. In heavy metal music, this is typically expanded to more complex sequences comprising a combination of chords, single notes and palm muting. The rhythm guitar parts in compositions performed by more technically oriented bands often include riffs employing complex lead guitar techniques. In some genres, especially metal, the audio signal from the rhythm guitar&#x27;s output is often subsequently run through some form of effect pedal or overdriven guitar amplifier in order to create a thicker, crunchier sound for the palm-muted rhythms.

===Interaction with other guitarists===
In bands with two or more guitarists, the guitarists may exchange or even duplicate roles for various songs or several sections within a song. In those with a single guitarist, the guitarist may play lead and rhythm at numerous times or simultaneously, by overlaying the rhythm sequence with a lead line.

===Crossover with keyboards===
Electronic effects units such as delay pedals and reverb units enable electric guitarists to play arpeggios and take over some of the role of a synthesizer player in performing sustained &quot;pads&quot;. These can serve as sonic backgrounds in modern pop. Creating a pad sound differs from usual rhythm guitar roles in that it is not rhythmic. Some bands have a synthesizer performer play pads. In bands without a synth player, a guitarist can take over this role.

===Replacing lead guitar===
Some rhythm techniques cross over into lead guitar playing. In guitar-bass-and-drums power trios guitarists must double up between rhythm and lead. For instance Jimi Hendrix combined full chords with solo licks, double stops and arpeggios. In recent years, &quot;looping pedals&quot; have been used to supply chord sequences or riffs over which musicians can then play the lead line, simulating the sound achieved by having two guitarists.

===Equipment===

A rhythm guitarist usually aims to generate a strong rhythmic and chordal sound, in contrast to the lead guitarist&#x27;s goal of producing sustained, often higher-pitched melody lines, that listeners can distinguish above the other instruments. As a result, rhythm and lead players often use different guitars and amplifiers. Rhythm guitarists may employ an electric acoustic guitar or a humbucker-equipped electric guitar for a richer and fatter output. Also, rhythm guitarists may use strings of a larger gauge than those used by lead guitarists. However, while these may be practices, they are not necessarily the rule and are subject to the style of the song and the preference of the individual guitarist.

While rhythm guitarists in metal bands use distortion effects, they tend to use less of the modulation effects such as flangers used by lead guitar players. Whereas the lead guitarist in a metal band is trying to make the solo tone more prominent, and thus uses a range of colorful effects, the rhythm guitarist is typically trying to provide a thick, solid supporting sound that blends in with the overall sound of the group. In alternative rock and post-punk, however, where the band may be aiming to create an ambient soundscape rather than an aggressive Motörhead-style &quot;Wall of Sound&quot;, the rhythm guitarist may use flanging and delay effects to create a shimmering background, or (as in The Smiths song &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot;), a reverberating tremolo effect.

==Jazz==
Rhythm guitar has been especially important in the development of jazz. The guitar took over the role previously occupied by the banjo to provide rhythmic chordal accompaniment.

Early jazz guitarists like Freddie Green tended to emphasize the percussive quality of the instrument. The ability to keep a steady rhythm while playing through complicated chord patterns made the guitar invaluable to many rhythm sections. Jazz guitarists are expected to have deep knowledge of harmony.

===Jazz harmony===
Jazz guitarists use their knowledge of harmony and jazz theory to create jazz chord &quot;voicings&quot;, which emphasize the 3rd and 7th notes of the chord. Unlike pop and rock guitarists, who typically include the root of a chord (even, with many open chords and barre chords, doubling the root), jazz guitarists typically omit the root. Some more sophisticated chord voicings also include the 9th, 11th, and 13th notes of the chord. A typical jazz voicing for the chord G7 would be the individual notes B, E, F, and A. This voicing uses the 3rd (the note B), the 7th (the note F), along with the 6th (the note E) and the 9th (the note A).

In some modern jazz styles, dominant 7th chords in a tune may contain altered 9ths (either flattened by a semitone, which is called a &quot;flat 9th&quot;, or sharpened by a semitone, which is called a &quot;sharp 9th&quot;); 11ths (sharpened by a semitone, which is called a &quot;sharp 11th&quot;); 13ths (typically flattened by a semitone, which is called a &quot;flat 13th&quot;).

Jazz guitarists need to learn about a range of different chords, including major 7th, major 6th, minor 7th, minor/major 7th, dominant 7th, diminished, half-diminished, and augmented chords. As well, they need to learn about chord transformations (e.g., altered chords, such as &quot;alt dominant chords&quot; described above), chord substitutions, and re-harmonization techniques. Some jazz guitarists use their knowledge of jazz scales and chords to provide a walking bass-style accompaniment.

Jazz guitarists learn to perform these chords over the range of different chord progressions used in jazz, such as the II-V-I progression, the jazz-style blues progression, the minor jazz-style blues form, the &quot;rhythm changes&quot; progression, and the variety of chord progressions used in jazz ballads, and jazz standards. Guitarists may also learn to use the chord types, strumming styles, and effects pedals (e.g., chorus effect or fuzzbox) used in 1970s-era jazz-Latin, jazz-funk, and jazz-rock fusion music.

===Big band rhythm===
In jazz big bands, popular during the 1930s and 1940s, the guitarist is considered an integral part of the rhythm section (guitar, drums and bass). They usually played a regular four chords to the bar, although an amount of harmonic improvisation is possible. Freddie Green, guitarist in the Count Basie orchestra, was a noted exponent of this style. The harmonies are often minimal; for instance, the root note is often omitted on the assumption that it will be supplied by the bassist.

===Small group comping===
When jazz guitarists play chords underneath a song&#x27;s melody or another musician&#x27;s solo improvisations, it is called &quot;comping&quot;, short for &quot;accompanying&quot;. The accompanying style in most jazz styles differs from the way chordal instruments accompany in many popular styles of music. In many popular styles of music, such as rock and pop, the rhythm guitarist usually performs the chords in rhythmic fashion which sets out the beat or groove of a tune. In contrast, in many modern jazz styles within smaller, the guitarist plays much more sparsely, intermingling periodic chords and delicate voicings into pauses in the melody or solo, and using periods of silence. Jazz guitarists commonly use a wide variety of inversions when comping, rather than only using standard voicings.

===Gypsy pumping===
Gypsy jazz is acoustic music, usually played without a drummer. Rhythm guitar in gypsy jazz uses a special form of strumming known as &quot;la pompe&quot;, i.e. &quot;the pump&quot;. This form of percussive rhythm is similar to the &quot;boom-chick&quot; in bluegrass styles; it is what gives the music its fast swinging feeling. The strumming hand, which never touches the top of the guitar, must make a quick up-down strum followed by a down strum. The up-down part of la pompe must be done extremely fast, regardless of the tempo of the music. It is very similar to a grace note in classical music, albeit the fact that an entire chord is used. This pattern is usually played in unison by two or more guitarists in the rhythm section.

===Jazz chord soloing===
Jazz guitar soloists are not limited to playing single notes by their instrument. This allows them to create &quot;chord solos&quot; by adding the song&#x27;s melody on top of the chord voicings. Wes Montgomery was noted for playing successive choruses in single notes, octaves and finally a chord solo. This technique differs from chord-melody soloing in that it is not intended to be used unaccompanied

==Funk==
Funk utilized the same extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. However, unlike bebop jazz, with its complex, rapid-fire chord changes, funk virtually abandoned chord changes, creating static single chord vamps with little harmonic movement, but with a complex and driving rhythmic feel. Some have jazz backgrounds. The chords used in funk songs typically imply a dorian or mixolydian mode, as opposed to the major or natural minor tonalities of most popular music. Melodic content was derived by mixing these modes with the blues scale.

In funk bands, guitarists typically play in a percussive style, often using the wah-wah sound effect and muting the notes in their riffs to create a percussive sound. Guitarists Ernie Isley of The Isley Brothers and Eddie Hazel of Funkadelic were notably influenced by Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s improvised solos. Eddie Hazel, who worked with George Clinton, is a notable guitar soloist in funk. Ernie Isley was tutored at an early age by Jimi Hendrix himself, when he was a part of The Isley Brothers backing band and lived in the attic temporarily at the Isleys&#x27; household. Jimmy Nolen and Phelps Collins are famous funk rhythm guitarists who both worked with James Brown.

==Reggae==

The guitar in reggae usually plays the chords on beats two and four, a musical figure known as skank or the &#x27;bang&#x27;. It has a very dampened, short and scratchy chop sound, almost like a percussion instrument. Sometimes a double chop is used when the guitar still plays the off beats, but also plays the following 16th or 8th beat on the up-stroke. Depending on the amount of swing or groove, this next secondary stab is often the 16th note sounding closer to an 8th placement in the rhythm. An example is the intro to &quot;Stir It Up&quot; by The Wailers. Artist and producer Derrick Harriott says, &quot;What happened was the musical thing was real widespread, but only among a certain sort of people. It was always a down-town thing, but more than just hearing the music. The equipment was so powerful and the vibe so strong that we feel it.&quot; Reggae chords are typically played without overdrive or distortion.

<text>The Red Hot Chili Peppers are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1982, consisting of Anthony Kiedis (vocals), Flea (bass), John Frusciante (guitar), and Chad Smith (drums). Their music incorporates elements of alternative rock, funk, punk rock, hard rock, hip hop, and psychedelic rock, and have influenced genres including funk metal, rap metal, rap rock, and nu metal. With over 120 million records sold worldwide, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the top-selling bands of all time. They hold the records for most number-one singles on the American Alternative Songs charts (15), most cumulative weeks at number one (91) and most top-ten songs (28) on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart. They have won three Grammy Awards, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012, and in 2022 received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

The Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in Los Angeles by Kiedis, Flea, the guitarist Hillel Slovak and the drummer Jack Irons. Due to commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on their 1984 self-titled debut album, which instead featured the guitarist Jack Sherman and the drummer Cliff Martinez. Slovak rejoined for their second album, &quot;Freaky Styley&quot; (1985), and Irons for their third, &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot; (1987). Irons left after Slovak died of a drug overdose in June 1988.

With Frusciante and Smith, the Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; (1989) and their first major commercial success, &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; (1991). Frusciante was uncomfortable with their newfound popularity and left abruptly on tour in 1992. After a series of temporary guitarists, he was replaced by Dave Navarro. Their next album, &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; (1995), failed to match the success of &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;. Frusciante and Kiedis struggled with drug addiction throughout the 1990s.

In 1998, Navarro departed and Frusciante rejoined the band. Their seventh album, &quot;Californication&quot; (1999), became their biggest commercial success, with 16 million copies sold worldwide. &quot;By the Way&quot; (2002) and &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot; (2006) were also successful; &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot; was their first album to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Frusciante left again in 2009 to focus on his solo career; he was replaced by Josh Klinghoffer, who appeared on &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Getaway&quot; (2016), before Frusciante rejoined in 2019. The Chili Peppers released their 12th and 13th albums, &quot;Unlimited Love&quot; and &quot;Return of the Dream Canteen&quot;, in 2022.

== History ==
=== 1982–1984: Early history ===
The Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in Los Angeles in 1982 as Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem by singer Anthony Kiedis, guitarist Hillel Slovak, bassist Flea, and drummer Jack Irons, classmates at Fairfax High School. Their first performance was on December 16, 1982, at the Grandia Room club on Hollywood Boulevard to a crowd of approximately 30. Gary Allen, a friend of the band, was hosting a release party for his new EP and asked Kiedis and Flea to put together an opening act.

At the time, Slovak and Irons were already committed to another group, What Is This?; however, the new band was asked to return the following week. In March, they changed their name to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, playing several shows at Los Angeles venues. Six songs from these shows were on the band&#x27;s first demo tape. In November 1983, manager Lindy Goetz struck a seven-album deal with EMI America and Enigma Records. Two weeks earlier, however, What Is This? had also obtained a record deal with MCA, and in December Slovak and Irons quit the Red Hot Chili Peppers to focus on What Is This?. Flea and Kiedis recruited Weirdos drummer Cliff Martinez and guitarist Jack Sherman.

The band released their debut album, &quot;The Red Hot Chili Peppers&quot;, in August 1984. Airplay on college radio and MTV helped build a fan base, and the album sold 300,000 copies. Gang of Four guitarist Andy Gill, who produced the album, pushed the band to play with a cleaner, more radio-friendly sound, and the band was disappointed with the result, finding it over-polished. The album included backing vocals by Gwen Dickey, the singer for the 1970s disco funk group Rose Royce. The band embarked on a grueling tour, performing 60 shows in 64 days. During the tour, continuing musical and lifestyle tension between Kiedis and Sherman complicated the transition between concert and daily band life. Sherman was fired in February 1985 and Slovak, who had just quit What Is This?, rejoined the band.

=== 1985–1988: Adding fans, drug abuse, and Slovak&#x27;s death ===

The second Chili Peppers album, &quot;Freaky Styley&quot; (1985), was produced by funk musician George Clinton, who introduced elements of punk and funk into the band&#x27;s repertoire. The album featured Maceo Parker and Fred Wesley. The band used heroin while recording the album, which influenced the lyrics and music. The band had a much better relationship with Clinton than with Gill, but &quot;Freaky Styley&quot;, released on August 16, 1985, also achieved little success, failing to make an impression on any chart. The band also considered the subsequent tour unproductive. Despite the lack of success, the band was satisfied with &quot;Freaky Styley&quot;; Kiedis reflected that &quot;it so surpassed anything we thought we could have done that we were thinking we were on the road to enormity.&quot; Around this time, the band appeared in the 1986 films &quot;Thrashin&#x27;&quot;, playing the song &quot;Blackeyed Blonde&quot; from &quot;Freaky Styley,&quot; and &quot;Tough Guys&quot;, performing the unreleased song &quot;Set It Straight&quot;.

In early 1986, EMI gave the Chili Peppers $5,000 to record a demo tape for their next album. They chose to work with producer Keith Levene from Public Image Ltd, as he shared their interest in drugs. Levene and Slovak put aside $2,000 of the budget to spend on heroin and cocaine, which created tension between the band members. Martinez&#x27;s &quot;heart was no longer in the band&quot;, but he did not quit, so Kiedis and Flea fired him in April 1986. Irons rejoined the band, to their surprise; it marked the first time all four founding members were together since 1983. During the recording and subsequent tour of &quot;Freaky Styley&quot;, Kiedis and Slovak were dealing with debilitating heroin addictions. Due to his addiction, Kiedis &quot;didn&#x27;t have the same drive or desire to come up with ideas or lyrics&quot; and appeared at rehearsal &quot;literally asleep&quot;.

For their third album, the Chili Peppers attempted to hire Rick Rubin to produce, but he declined due to the band&#x27;s increasing drug problems. They eventually hired Michael Beinhorn from the art funk project Material, their last choice. The early attempts at recording were halted due to Kiedis&#x27; worsening drug problems, and Kiedis was briefly fired. After the band were named &quot;band of the year&quot; by &quot;LA Weekly&quot;, Kiedis entered drug rehabilitation. The band auditioned new singers, but Kiedis, now sober, rejoined the recording sessions with new enthusiasm. Songs formed quickly, blending the funk feel and rhythms of &quot;Freaky Styley&quot; with a harder, more immediate approach to punk rock. The album was recorded in the basement of the Capitol Records Building. The recording process was difficult; Kiedis would frequently disappear to seek drugs; after fifty days of sobriety, Kiedis had decided to take drugs again to celebrate his new music.

The third Red Hot Chili Peppers album, &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot;, was released in September 1987 and peaked at No. 148 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, a significant improvement over their earlier albums. The band immediately embarked on a two and a half month North American tour to promote the release, accompanied by Faith No More as support who were also promoting their new album &quot;Introduce Yourself&quot;. During that period, however, Kiedis and Slovak had both developed serious drug addictions, often disappearing for days on end. Slovak died from a heroin overdose on June 25, 1988, soon after the conclusion of the &quot;Uplift&quot; tour. Kiedis fled the city and did not attend Slovak&#x27;s funeral. Irons, troubled by the death, left the band; following years of depression, he became a member of the Seattle grunge band Pearl Jam in 1994.

=== 1988–1989: Frusciante and Smith join ===
DeWayne &quot;Blackbyrd&quot; McKnight, a former member of Parliament-Funkadelic, joined as guitarist, and D. H. Peligro of Dead Kennedys joined as drummer. Kiedis re-entered rehab for 30 days, and visited Slovak&#x27;s grave as part of his rehabilitation, finally confronting his grief. Three dates into the tour, McKnight was fired for lack of chemistry with the band. McKnight was so unhappy he threatened to burn down Kiedis&#x27; house.

Peligro introduced Kiedis and Flea to the 18-year-old guitarist John Frusciante, a fan of the band, who brought a darker and more melodic style. Frusciante performed his first show with the Chili Peppers in September 1988. The new lineup began writing for the next album and went on a short tour, the Turd Town Tour. In November, Kiedis and Flea fired Peligro due to his drug and alcohol problems. After open auditions, they hired the drummer Chad Smith in December 1988, who has remained since. According to Smith, &quot;We started playing, and right away we just hit it off musically.&quot;

The Chili Peppers began work on their fourth album in late 1988. Unlike the stop-start sessions for &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan,&quot; preproduction went smoothly. However, the sessions were made tense by Beinhorn&#x27;s desire to create a hit, frustrating Frusciante and Kiedis. Released on August 16, 1989, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; peaked at number 52 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The record failed to chart in the United Kingdom and Europe, but climbed to number 33 in Australia. &quot;Knock Me Down&quot; reached number six on the U.S. Modern Rock Tracks chart, whereas &quot;Higher Ground&quot; charted at number eleven and reached number 54 in the UK and 45 in Australia and France. &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; was certified gold in March 1990 and was the first Chili Peppers album to ship over 500,000 units.

=== 1990–1993: &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;, fame, and Frusciante&#x27;s first departure ===

In 1990, after the success of &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot;, the Chili Peppers left EMI and entered a major-label bidding war. They signed with Warner Bros. Records and hired Rick Rubin, a producer they had tried to hire before. Rubin turned the band down in 1987 because of their drug problems but he felt that they were now healthier and more focused. He produced several more of their albums. The writing process was more productive than it had been for &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot;, with Kiedis saying, &quot;[every day], there was new music for me to lyricize&quot;. At Rubin&#x27;s suggestion, they recorded in The Mansion, a studio in a house in Laurel Canyon where magician Harry Houdini once lived.

In September 1991, &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; was released. &quot;Give It Away&quot; was the first single, which achieved international fame and became the band&#x27;s first number-one single on the Modern Rock chart. The ballad &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; was the second single, and reached number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, the band&#x27;s highest position to date. &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; sold over 12 million copies. It was listed at number 310 on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; list of 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and in 1992 it rose to number three on the US album charts, almost a year after its release. The album was accompanied by a documentary, &quot;Funky Monks&quot;. The Chili Peppers began their &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; tour, which featured Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Smashing Pumpkins, three of the era&#x27;s biggest upcoming bands in alternative music, as opening acts.

Frusciante was troubled by fame, and began falling out with Kiedis. He isolated himself and developed a secret heroin addiction. In an appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; he performed off-key; Kiedis believed he wanted to sabotage the performance. Frusciante abruptly quit after a show in Tokyo in May 1992. He returned to Los Angeles and spent years living in squalor, struggling with addiction. The Chili Peppers contacted Dave Navarro to replace Frusciante. Navarro had just split from Jane&#x27;s Addiction, but he was involved in drug problems too. After failed auditions with Zander Schloss, they hired Arik Marshall of the Los Angeles band Marshall Law, and headlined the Lollapalooza festival in 1992. Marshall appeared in the music videos for &quot;Breaking the Girl&quot; and &quot;If You Have to Ask&quot;, as well as the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;. In September 1992, the Chili Peppers performed &quot;Give It Away&quot; at the MTV Video Music Awards. They were nominated for seven awards, winning three, including Viewer&#x27;s Choice. In February 1993, they performed &quot;Give It Away&quot; at the Grammy Awards, and the song won the band their first Grammy, Best Hard Rock Performance With Vocal.

The Chili Peppers dismissed Marshall and held auditions for a new guitarist, including Buckethead, whom Flea felt was not right for the band. Jesse Tobias of the Los Angeles band Mother Tongue was briefly hired, but dismissed due to poor chemistry. However, Navarro said he was now ready to join the band. In August 1993, the non-album single &quot;Soul to Squeeze&quot; was released and featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Coneheads&quot;. The song topped the Billboard US Modern Rock chart.

=== 1994–1997: &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; and Dave Navarro ===

Navarro first appeared with the Chili Peppers at Woodstock &#x27;94, performing early versions of new songs. This was followed by a brief tour, including headlining appearances at Pukkelpop and Reading Festivals and two performances as the opening act for the Rolling Stones. The relationship between Navarro and the band began to deteriorate; Navarro admitted he did not care for funk music or jamming. Kiedis had relapsed into heroin addiction following a dental procedure in which an addictive sedative, Valium, was used, though the band did not discover this until later.

Without Frusciante, songs were written at a far slower rate. Kiedis said: &quot;John had been a true anomaly when it came to songwriting... I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit and the next thing you knew you had a song. That didn&#x27;t happen right off the bat with Dave.&quot;

&quot;One Hot Minute&quot; was released in September 1995 after several delays. It departed from the Chili Peppers&#x27; previous sound, with Navarro&#x27;s guitar work incorporating heavy metal riffs and psychedelic rock. The band described it as a darker, sadder record. Kiedis&#x27;s lyrics addressed drugs, including the lead single, &quot;Warped&quot;, and broken relationships and deaths of loved ones, including &quot;Tearjerker&quot;, written about Kurt Cobain and &quot;Transcending&quot; about River Phoenix. Although it received mixed reviews, the album sold eight million copies worldwide. The band also contributed to soundtracks including &quot;Working Class Hero: A Tribute to John Lennon&quot; and &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America.&quot; Flea and Navarro played on Alanis Morissette&#x27;s single &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;.

The Chili Peppers began the tour for &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; in Europe in 1995. The US tour was postponed after Smith broke his wrist. In 1997, several shows were canceled following deteriorating band relations, injuries, and Navarro and Kiedis&#x27; drug use. The band played three shows that year, including the first Fuji Rock Festival in Japan. In April 1998, the Chili Peppers announced that Navarro had left due to creative differences. Kiedis said the decision was mutual. Reports at the time indicated that Navarro&#x27;s departure came after he attended a band practice under the influence of drugs.

===1998–2001: Return of Frusciante and &quot;Californication&quot;===

With no guitarist, the Red Hot Chili Peppers were on the verge of breaking up. In the years following Frusciante&#x27;s departure, his heroin addiction had left him in poverty and near death. Flea convinced Frusciante to enter Las Encinas Drug Rehabilitation Center in eastern Pasadena, California, in January 1998. His addiction left him with scarring on his arms, a restructured nose, and dental implants following an oral infection. In April 1998, Flea visited the recovered Frusciante and asked him to rejoin the band. Frusciante began sobbing and said nothing would make him happier.

In June 1999, after more than a year of production, the Red Hot Chili Peppers released &quot;Californication&quot;, their seventh studio album. It sold over 16 million copies, and remains their most successful album. &quot;Californication&quot; contained fewer rap songs than its predecessors, instead integrating textured and melodic guitar riffs, vocals and basslines. It produced three number-one modern rock hits, &quot;Scar Tissue&quot;, &quot;Otherside&quot; and &quot;Californication&quot;. &quot;Californication&quot; received stronger reviews than &quot;One Hot Minute&quot;, and was a greater success worldwide. While many critics credited the success of the album to Frusciante&#x27;s return, they also felt Kiedis&#x27; vocals had also improved. It was later listed at number 399 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

&quot;Californication&quot; was supported with a two-year international world tour, producing the first Chili Peppers concert DVD, &quot;Off the Map&quot; (2001). In July 1999, the Chili Peppers played the closing show at Woodstock 1999. During the set, a small fire escalated into violence and vandalism, resulting in the intervention of riot control squads. ATMs and several semi-tractor trailers were looted and destroyed. The band was blamed in the media for inciting the riots after performing a cover of the Jimi Hendrix song &quot;Fire&quot;. In his memoir, Kiedis wrote: &quot;It was clear that this situation had nothing to do with Woodstock anymore. It wasn&#x27;t symbolic of peace and love, but of greed and cashing in.&quot;

===2001–2004: &quot;By the Way&quot;===

The Chili Peppers began writing their next album in early 2001, immediately after the &quot;Californication&quot; tour. Frusciante and Kiedis collaborated for days straight, discussing and sharing guitar progressions and lyrics. For Kiedis, &quot;writing &quot;By the Way&quot; ... was a whole different experience from &quot;Californication&quot;. John was back to himself and brimming with confidence.&quot; The recording was difficult for Flea, who felt his role was being diminished and fought with Frusciante about the musical direction. Flea considered quitting the band after the album, but the two worked out their problems.
&quot;By the Way&quot; was released in July 2002 and produced four singles; &quot;By the Way&quot;, &quot;The Zephyr Song&quot;, &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; and &quot;Universally Speaking&quot;. The album was their most subdued to date, focusing on melodic ballads over rap and funk, with layered textures, more keyboards, and string arrangements. The album was followed by an eighteen-month world tour, a concert DVD, &quot;Live at Slane Castle&quot;, and the band&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Red Hot Chili Peppers Live in Hyde Park&quot;. More than 258,000 fans paid over $17,100,000 for tickets over three nights, a 2004 record; the event ranked No. 1 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Top Concert Boxscores of 2004. In November 2003, the Chili Peppers released their &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, which featured new songs &quot;Fortune Faded&quot; and &quot;Save the Population&quot;.

=== 2005–2007: &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot; ===

In 2006, the Chili Peppers released their ninth album, &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot;. Although they initially planned to release a trilogy of albums, they chose to release a 28-track double album. It was their first album to debut at number one on the US charts, where it stayed for two weeks, and debuted at number one in the UK and 25 other countries. &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot; sold over seven million units. It won the Grammys for Best Rock Album and Best Rock Performance by a Duo Or Group With Vocal (&quot;Dani California&quot;).
The first single, &quot;Dani California&quot;, was the band&#x27;s fastest-selling single, debuting on top of the Modern Rock chart in the U.S., peaking at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and reaching number 2 in the UK. &quot;Tell Me Baby&quot;, released next, also topped the charts in 2006. &quot;Snow (Hey Oh)&quot; was released in late 2006, breaking multiple records by 2007. The song became their eleventh number-one single, giving the band a cumulative total of 81 weeks at number one. It was also the first time three consecutive singles by the band made it to number one. &quot;Desecration Smile&quot; was released internationally in February 2007 and reached number 27 on the UK charts. &quot;Hump de Bump&quot; was planned to be the next single for the US, Canada, and Australia only, but due to positive feedback from the music video, it was released as a worldwide single in May 2007.
The Stadium Arcadium World Tour began in 2006, including several festival dates. Frusciante&#x27;s friend and frequent musical collaborator Josh Klinghoffer joined the touring band, contributing guitar, backing vocals, and keyboards. The band was a musical guest for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in May 2006 and Tom Hanks hosted the show.

=== 2008–2009: Klinghoffer replaces Frusciante ===
After the Stadium Arcadium tour, the Chili Peppers took an extended break. Kiedis attributed this to the band being worn out from their years of nonstop work since &quot;Californication&quot;. Their only recording during that time was in 2008 with George Clinton on his album &quot;George Clinton and His Gangsters of Love;&quot; accompanied by Kim Manning, they recorded a new version of Shirley and Lee&#x27;s classic &quot;Let the Good Times Roll&quot;.

Kiedis, who had recently become a father, planned to spend the time taking care of his son and developing a television series based on his autobiography, &quot;Spider and Son.&quot; Flea began taking music theory classes at the University of Southern California, and revealed plans to release a mainly instrumental solo record; guest musicians included Patti Smith and a choir from the Silverlake Conservatory of Music. He also joined Thom Yorke in the supergroup Atoms for Peace. Frusciante released his album &quot;The Empyrean&quot;. Smith worked with Sammy Hagar, Joe Satriani, and Michael Anthony in the supergroup Chickenfoot, as well as on his solo project, Chad Smith&#x27;s Bombastic Meatbats.

In July 2009, Frusciante again left the Chili Peppers, though no announcement was made until December. Frusciante explained on his Myspace page that there was no ill feeling about his departure this time, and that he wanted to focus on his solo work. In October 2009, the Chili Peppers entered the studio to begin writing their tenth studio album, with Klinghoffer replacing Frusciante. In January 2010, the Chili Peppers made their live comeback in January 2010, paying tribute to Neil Young with a cover of &quot;A Man Needs a Maid&quot; at MusiCares. In February, after months of speculation, Klinghoffer was confirmed as Frusciante&#x27;s replacement.

=== 2011–2014: &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; ===

Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded their tenth album, &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot;, between September 2010 and March 2011. They decided against releasing another double album, reducing the album to 14 tracks. &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; was released in the US in August 2011. It topped the charts in 18 countries, and received mostly positive reviews. &quot;The Adventures of Rain Dance Maggie&quot;, became the band&#x27;s 12th number-one single. &quot;Monarchy of Roses&quot;, &quot;Look Around&quot; and &quot;Did I Let You Know&quot; (released only in Brazil), and &quot;Brendan&#x27;s Death Song&quot; were also released as singles.
In July 2011, the Chili Peppers played three invitation-only warm-up shows in California, their first since 2007. They began a month-long promotional tour in August 2011, starting in Asia. The I&#x27;m with You World Tour ran from September 2011 until 2013. The North American leg, expected to begin in January 2012, was postponed to March due to a surgery Kiedis required for foot injuries he had sustained during the Stadium Arcadium tour. After the &quot;I&#x27;m with You World Tour&quot;, the band set out on another small tour, including their first shows in Alaska, Paraguay, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. Recordings from the tours were released in 2012 on the free &quot;2011 Live EP.&quot;
The Chili Peppers were nominated for two MTV Europe Music Awards for &quot;Best Rock Band&quot; and &quot;Best Live Artist&quot; and nominated for &quot;Best Group&quot; at the 2012 People&#x27;s Choice Awards &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; was also nominated for a 2012 Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. In April 2012, the Chili Peppers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A month later &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Covers EP&quot;, was released for downloads only, consisting of previously released studio and live covers of artists which had influenced the band. From August 2012, the band began releasing a series of singles as the &quot;I&#x27;m with You Sessions,&quot; which were compiled on the &quot;I&#x27;m Beside You&quot; LP in November 2013 as a Record Store Day exclusive.

In February 2014, the Chili Peppers joined Bruno Mars as performers at the Super Bowl XLVIII half-time show, watched by a record 115.3 million viewers. The performance was met with mixed reviews for its use of backing music; Flea responded that it was an NFL rule for bands to pre-record music due to time and technical issues, and that they had agreed because it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. He said Kiedis&#x27; vocals were completely live and the band had recorded &quot;Give it Away&quot; during rehearsals. The band began another tour in May 2013, which ended in June 2014. &quot;2012-13 Live EP&quot; was released in July 2014 through their website as a free download.

=== 2015–2018: &quot;The Getaway&quot; ===

The Chili Peppers released &quot;Fandemonium&quot; in November 2014, a book dedicated to their fans. In December 2014, they began work on their eleventh album, their first without producer Rick Rubin since 1989; instead it was produced by Danger Mouse. Flea broke his arm during a skiing trip, which delayed the recording for several months. &quot;Dark Necessities&quot;, the first single from their upcoming album, was released on May 5. Their eleventh album, &quot;The Getaway&quot;, was released in June. Kiedis said that the songs were influenced by a two-year relationship that fell apart. &quot;Dark Necessities&quot; became the band&#x27;s 25th top-ten single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart, a record they hold over U2. In February 2016, &quot;Circle of the Noose&quot;, an unreleased song recorded with Navarro in 1998, was leaked.
In May, the band released &quot;The Getaway&quot;. The music video for &quot;Dark Necessities&quot;, directed by actress Olivia Wilde, was released in June 2016. &quot;The Getaway&quot; made its debut at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, behind Drake, who had the number-one album for eight consecutive weeks. &quot;The Getaway&quot; outsold Drake its opening week with album sales of 108,000 to 33,000 (actually placing him at 4th in sales for the week) though due to album streaming, Drake managed to top the band for the top position in the charts. In July 2016, the &quot;Live In Paris EP&quot; was released exclusively through the music streaming website Deezer. &quot;Go Robot&quot; was announced as the second single from &quot;The Getaway&quot;. In the same month, the band members started to post images from the set of the music video. &quot;The Getaway&quot; was reissued on limited edition pink vinyl in September, as part of 10 Bands 1 Cause. All money from sales of the re-issue went to Gilda&#x27;s Club NYC an organization that provides community support for both those diagnosed with cancer and their caretakers. It is named after comedian Gilda Radner.

The band began the headlining portion of the Getaway World Tour in September with the North American leg, featuring Jack Irons, the band&#x27;s original drummer, as an opening act, beginning in January 2017. Dave Rat, the band&#x27;s sound engineer since 1991, announced that after the show of January 22, 2017, he would no longer be working with the band.

The Getaway World Tour concluded in October 2017. The tour consisted of 151 shows lasting a year and almost five months. In December, the band headlined the Band Together 2 Benefit Concert at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. Money raised from the concert went to the Tipping Point Emergency Relief Fund which between 2005 and 2017 raised $150 million to educate, employ, house and support those in need in the Bay Area.

=== 2019–2023: Frusciante&#x27;s second return, &quot;Unlimited Love&quot;, and &quot;Return of the Dream Canteen&quot; ===

The recording of the next Chili Peppers album was delayed due to the Woolsey Fire; the band performed a benefit show for fire victims on January 13, 2019. In February, they performed &quot;Dark Necessities&quot; with rapper Post Malone at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards. They appeared in Malone&#x27;s music video for &quot;Wow&quot;, released in March.
In February 2019, the Chili Peppers began a month-long tour, featuring their first headlining shows in Australia in 12 years, including their first show in Tasmania, which was briefly halted due to a power outage. On March 15, they performed in Egypt, becoming one of the few acts allowed to perform at the Pyramids of Giza. The performance was livestreamed. On October 26, David Mushegain, a photographer, announced that a Chili Peppers documentary was in the works.

On December 15, 2019, the Chili Peppers announced that after 10 years, Frusciante had rejoined, replacing Klinghoffer. They wrote that Klinghoffer was &quot;a beautiful musician who we respect and love&quot;. In an interview, Klinghoffer said there was no animosity: &quot;It&#x27;s absolutely John&#x27;s place to be in that band... I&#x27;m happy that he&#x27;s back with them.&quot; On November 2, the Chili Peppers performed their final show with Klinghoffer, at a charity event at the Silverlake Conservatory of Music in Los Angeles. Klinghoffer released his debut solo album, &quot;To Be One with You&quot;, on November 22, 2019, featuring Flea and the former Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons. On February 8, 2020, Frusciante performed with the Chili Peppers for the first time in 13 years at a memorial service held by the Tony Hawk Foundation for the film producer Andrew Burkle, the son of billionaire Ronald Burkle. Shows were scheduled for three festivals that May, but were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In August, the former Chili Peppers guitarist Jack Sherman died aged 64; the band released a statement thanking him for &quot;all times good, bad and in between&quot;.

On April 24, 2021, the Chili Peppers announced that they had left Q Prime, their management company for the previous 20 years, and they would be managed by their longtime friend Guy Oseary, founder of Maverick Records. On May 3, it was reported that the Red Hot Chili Peppers would sell their back catalog to Hipgnosis Songs Fund for $140–$150 million. On March 31, the Chili Peppers received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
The 12th Red Hot Chili Peppers album, &quot;Unlimited Love&quot;, produced by Rubin, was released on April 1, 2022. It debuted at number one in ten countries, becoming the first US number-one Chili Peppers album since &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot;. It was promoted with the singles &quot;Black Summer&quot; and &quot;These Are the Ways&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; wrote that &quot;Unlimited Love&quot; shared the &quot;melancholic riffmaking, anthemic choruses and softly-sung melodies&quot; of Frusciante&#x27;s previous work with the Chili Peppers, but introduced new &quot;grungy&quot; and acoustic elements.

On the day of the release, the broadcasting company Sirius XM launched a dedicated Red Hot Chili Peppers channel, Whole Lotta Red Hot, featuring music videos, live performances and acts that influenced the Chili Peppers. On June 4, the Red Hot Chili Peppers began their Unlimited Love Tour. The 13th Chili Peppers album, &quot;Return of the Dream Canteen&quot;, recorded during the same sessions as &quot;Unlimited Love,&quot; was released on October 14. The first single, &quot;Tippa My Tongue&quot;, was released in August, followed by &quot;The Drummer&quot; in October. The band&#x27;s former drummer D.H. Peligro died at the age of 63 on October 28.

=== 2024–present: Upcoming fourteenth album ===
In April 2024, Smith said that the Chili Peppers would take a break following their 2024 tour dates, and would start writing their next album in 2025. For the closing ceremony of the 2024 Paris Olympics on August 11, the Chili Peppers provided a performance of &quot;Can&#x27;t Stop&quot; (&quot;Eddie&quot; was performed during a post-Olympics special on NBC) in Long Beach, California, representing Los Angeles, where the 2028 Summer Olympics will be held.

On January 30, 2025, the Red Hot Chili Peppers played their first show of the year at the FireAid benefit concert, which took place at the Kia Forum.

==Artistry==
=== Musical style and influences ===

The music of the Red Hot Chili Peppers has been characterized as funk rock, alternative rock, funk metal, and rap rock, with influences from hard, psychedelic, and punk rock. Regarding their genre, Flea stated in a 2006 &quot;Guitar World&quot; interview, &quot;For all the styles that have come and gone through-out our career, we never really aligned ourselves with any of them; we were never part of any movement. At one time, people put us together in a category with Fishbone and Faith No More, but we were always different from those bands, and they were always different from us.&quot; The band&#x27;s influences include Parliament-Funkadelic, Defunkt, Jimi Hendrix, the Misfits, Black Sabbath, Metallica, James Brown, Gang of Four, Bob Marley, Big Boys, Bad Brains, Sly and the Family Stone, Ohio Players, Queen, Stevie Wonder, Elvis Presley, Deep Purple, the Beach Boys, Black Flag, Ornette Coleman, Led Zeppelin, Yes, Fugazi, Fishbone, Marvin Gaye, Billie Holiday, Santana, Elvis Costello, the Stooges, the Clash, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Devo, and Miles Davis.

===Vocals and instrumentation===
Kiedis provided multiple vocal styles. His primary approach up to &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; was spoken verse and rapping, which he complemented with traditional vocals. This helped the band to maintain a consistent style. As the group matured, notably with &quot;Californication&quot; (1999), they reduced the number of rapped verses. &quot;By the Way&quot; (2002) contained only two songs with a rap-driven verse and melodic chorus. Kiedis&#x27; more recent style was developed through ongoing coaching.

Original guitarist Slovak&#x27;s style was based in blues and funk. Slovak was primarily influenced by hard-rock artists such as Hendrix, Kiss and Led Zeppelin, while his playing method was based on improvisation common in funk. He was noted for an aggressive playing style; he would often play with such force, that his fingers would &quot;come apart&quot;. Kiedis observed that his playing evolved during his time away from the group in What Is This?, when Slovak adopted a more fluid style featuring &quot;sultry&quot; elements compared to his earlier hard-rock techniques. On &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot; (1987), Slovak experimented with genres outside of traditional funk music including reggae and speed metal. His guitar riffs often served as the basis of the group&#x27;s songs, with the other members writing their parts to complement his guitar work. His melodic riff featured in the song &quot;Behind the Sun&quot; inspired the group to create &quot;pretty&quot; songs with an emphasis on melody. Kiedis describes the song as &quot;pure Hillel inspiration&quot;. Slovak also used a talk box on songs such as &quot;Green Heaven&quot; and &quot;Funky Crime&quot;, in which he would sing into a tube while playing to create psychedelic effects.

Frusciante&#x27;s guitar playing style has evolved over the course of his career, with a technique that employs melody and emotion rather than virtuosity. Although virtuoso influences can be heard throughout his career, he has said that he often minimizes this. Frusciante brought a melodic and textured sound, notably on &quot;Californication&quot;, &quot;By the Way&quot;, and &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot; (2006). This contrasts with his earlier abrasive approach in &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot;, as well as his dry, funky and more docile arrangements on &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;. On &quot;Californication&quot; and &quot;By the Way&quot;, Frusciante derived the technique of creating tonal texture through chord patterns from post-punk guitarist Vini Reilly of the Durutti Column, and bands such as Fugazi and the Cure. On &quot;By the Way&quot;, he wanted people to be able to sing the lead guitar part, influenced by John McGeoch of Siouxsie and the Banshees, Johnny Marr of the Smiths, and Bernard Sumner of Joy Division. He initially wanted this album to be composed of &quot;these punky, rough songs&quot;, drawing inspiration from early punk artists such as the Germs and the Damned, an English band. However, that was discouraged by Rubin, the producer. Instead he built on &quot;Californication&quot;″s melodically driven style. During the recording of &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot; (2006), he moved away from his new-wave influences and concentrated on emulating flashier guitar players such as Hendrix and Van Halen. Navarro brought his own sound to the band during his tenure, with his style based on heavy metal, progressive rock, and psychedelia.

Flea&#x27;s bass guitar style can be considered an amalgamation of funk, psychedelic, punk, and hard rock. The groove-heavy melodies, played through either finger-picking or slapping, contributed to their signature style. While Flea&#x27;s slap bass style was prominent in earlier albums, albums after &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; have more melodic and funk-driven bass lines. He has also used double stops on some newer songs. Flea&#x27;s bass playing has changed considerably throughout the years. When he joined Fear, his technique centered largely around traditional punk-rock bass lines. However, he changed this style when the Red Hot Chili Peppers formed. He began to incorporate a &quot;slap&quot; bass style that drew influence largely from Bootsy Collins. &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; saw a notable shift in style as it featured none of his signature technique but focused more on traditional and melodic roots. His intellectual beliefs as a musician also shifted: &quot;I was trying to play simply on &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; because I had been playing too much prior to that, so I thought, &#x27;I&#x27;ve really got to chill out and play half as many notes&#x27;. When you play less, it&#x27;s more exciting—there&#x27;s more room for everything. If I do play something busy, it stands out, instead of the bass being a constant onslaught of notes. Space is good.&quot;

Drummer Smith blends rock with funk, mixing metal and jazz to his beats. Influences include Buddy Rich and John Bonham. He brought a different sound to &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot;, playing tight and fast. In &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot;, he displays greater power. He is recognized for his ghost notes, his beats and his fast right foot. MusicRadar put him in sixth place on their list of the &quot;50 Greatest Drummers Of All Time&quot;. During their early career, the Chili Peppers often performed nude, wearing only socks over their genitals; that became a part of their stage persona and brought them early notoriety.

=== Lyrical themes and inspirations ===
Early in the group&#x27;s history, Kiedis wrote comical songs filled with sexual innuendos and songs inspired by friendship and the band members&#x27; personal experiences. However, after the death of his close friend and bandmate Hillel Slovak, Kiedis&#x27; lyrics became much more introspective and personal, as exemplified by the &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot; song &quot;Knock Me Down&quot;, which was dedicated to Slovak along with the &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; song &quot;My Lovely Man&quot;. When the band recorded &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; (1995), Kiedis had turned to drugs once again, which resulted in darker lyrics. He began to write about anguish, and the self-mutilating thoughts he experienced as a result of his drug addiction. The album also featured tributes to close friends the band lost during the recording process including Kurt Cobain on the song &quot;Tearjerker&quot; and River Phoenix on the song &quot;Transcending&quot;.

After witnessing Frusciante&#x27;s recovery from his heroin addiction, Kiedis wrote many songs inspired by rebirth and the meaning of life on &quot;Californication&quot;. He was also intrigued by the life lessons that the band had learned, including Kiedis&#x27; experience with meeting a young mother at the YMCA, who was attempting to battle her crack addiction while living with her infant daughter.

On &quot;By the Way&quot;, Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love and his girlfriend. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis&#x27; writings, as he had only been sober since 2000. Tracks such as &quot;This Is the Place&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget Me&quot; expressed his intense dislike for narcotics and the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him. &quot;Stadium Arcadium&quot; (2006) continued the themes of love and romance; Kiedis said, that &quot;love and women, pregnancies and marriages, relationship struggles—those are real and profound influences on this record. And it&#x27;s great, because it wasn&#x27;t just me writing about the fact that I&#x27;m in love. It was everybody in the band. We were brimming with energy based on falling in love.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m with You&quot; (2011) again featured Kiedis writing about the loss of a close friend, this time in the song &quot;Brendan&#x27;s Death Song&quot;, a tribute to club owner Brendan Mullen who gave the band some of their earliest shows and showed support to them throughout their career.

Themes within Kiedis&#x27; repertoire include love and friendship, teenage angst, good-time aggression, various sexual topics and the link between sex and music, political and social commentary (Native American issues in particular), romance, loneliness, globalization and the cons of fame and Hollywood, poverty, drugs, alcohol, dealing with death, and California.

== Legacy and influence ==
The Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; mix of hard rock, funk and hip hop has influenced genres such as funk metal, rap metal, rap rock, and nu metal.

AllMusic claims that in 1992, &quot;oodles of (mostly horribly bad) funk-metal acts were following in Faith No More and the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27; footsteps.&quot; Bands who have cited the Red Hot Chili Peppers as an influence include Incubus, Mr. Bungle, Primus, Rage Against the Machine, System of a Down, Papa Roach, 311, and Sugar Ray.

The members of Korn, who were formerly in the funk metal band L.A.P.D., have also cited them as an influence. Kiedis said the band were early to combine &quot;hardcore funk and hip-hop-style vocals&quot;, and suggested that they had influenced Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, and Linkin Park. Smith said, &quot;Certainly Anthony&#x27;s singing style and voice lends itself to being unique, and nobody sounds like him. The cool thing about it is we can play any style of music whether it&#x27;s hard and fast, or loud or quiet, slow or medium, whatever it is; rock or funk, and it still sounds like us. I&#x27;m proud of that because sometimes bands don&#x27;t have that strong personality where you go, &#x27;Oh, that&#x27;s boom, right away.&#x27;&quot;

== Awards and recognition ==
The Red Hot Chili Peppers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2012. The induction lineup was Kiedis, Flea, Smith, Klinghoffer, Frusciante, Slovak (represented by his brother James), Irons, and Martinez. Frusciante was invited, but did not attend. Navarro and Sherman were not inducted; Sherman said that he felt &quot;dishonored&quot;. The band performed &quot;By the Way&quot;, &quot;Give It Away&quot; and &quot;Higher Ground&quot;, which included Irons and Martinez on drums. It was the first time Kiedis and Flea had performed with Irons in more than 20 years.

In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; released their first list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;, with &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; at #310 and &quot;Californication&quot; at #399. In 2012, a revised list was released, with &quot;Californication&quot; at #401. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; released another version of the list, with &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; at #186 and &quot;Californication&quot; at #286. The band received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on March 31, 2022. George Clinton, Woody Harrelson, and Bob Forrest unveiled the star at the ceremony. On August 28, 2022, the band received the Global Icon Award at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards. The award was presented to them by Cheech &amp; Chong.

== Public profile ==

=== Activism ===
In 1990, the Chili Peppers appeared in PSA ads for Rock the Vote, a non-profit organization in the United States geared toward increasing voter turnout in the United States Presidential Election among voters ages 18 to 24. The band was invited by the Beastie Boys and the Milarepa Fund to perform at the Tibetan Freedom Concert in June 1996 in San Francisco. They also performed at the June 1998 Washington, D.C. concert. The concerts, which were broadcast worldwide, were to support the cause of Tibetan independence.

In September 2005, the band performed &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; at the ReAct Now: Music &amp; Relief benefit which was held to raise money for the victims of Hurricane Katrina. The live event raised about $30 million. In July 2007, the band performed on behalf of former U.S. Vice President Al Gore who invited the band to perform at the London version of his Live Earth concerts which were held to raise awareness towards global warming and solving the most critical environmental issues of our time. The band performed a free concert in downtown Cleveland, Ohio in April 2012 in support of President Obama&#x27;s re-election campaign. The requirement for getting into the concert was agreeing to volunteer for the Obama 2012 phone bank. The event quickly met its capacity limit after being announced.

In May 2013, the band performed a concert in Portland, Oregon for the Dalai Lama as part of the Dalai Lama Environmental Summit. In January 2015, they performed their first show of the new year for the &quot;Sean Penn &amp; Friends Help Haiti Home&quot; fundraiser in support of the J/P Haitian Relief Organization. In September 2015, the band joined more than 120 other entertainers and celebrities to formally endorse Bernie Sanders for President during the Democratic primary ahead of the 2016 presidential election. The band performed at a fundraiser event at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach, California in the same month and the money was donated to A Reason To Survive (ARTS), Heartbeat Music Academy, San Diego Young Artists Music Academy, and the Silverlake Conservatory of Music. In October, Kiedis and Flea hosted the annual benefit for the Silverlake Conservatory of Music. The band performed a special rare acoustic set.

In February 2016, the band headlined a fundraiser concert in support of Sanders. In April, they performed at a private function on behalf of Facebook and Napster founder Sean Parker for his launch of The Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy. Smith and Will Ferrell hosted the &quot;Red Hot Benefit Comedy + Music Show &amp; Quinceanera&quot; in the same month. The benefit featured a performance by the Chili Peppers along with comedy acts selected by Ferrell and Funny or Die. A portion of the proceeds went to Ferrell&#x27;s Cancer for College and Smith&#x27;s Silverlake Conservatory of Music southwest of Glendale. In February 2018, Smith again joined Ferrell at his One Classy Night benefit at the Moore Theatre in Seattle to help raise money for Cancer for College. The event raised $300,000 in college scholarship money for students who have survived cancer.

=== Conviction and sexual harassment ===
On April 21, 1989, Kiedis was convicted of sexual battery and indecent exposure after a concert at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia. He exposed himself and pressed his penis to a woman&#x27;s face against her wishes. He was fined $1,000 on each charge. In 1990, Kiedis said the incident was &quot;blown way out of proportion by both the media and the prosecution&quot;, and was merely &quot;a playful thing that happened backstage&quot; with no intent of harm.

In 1990, Flea and Smith were arrested on charges of battery in Daytona Beach, Florida at a spring break performance for MTV. Flea was also charged with disorderly conduct and solicitation to commit an unnatural and lascivious act. Flea picked up a 20-year-old woman and threw her into the sand, while Smith forcibly removed her bathing suit and slapped her buttocks. Flea allegedly demanded that she perform oral sex on him before both he and Smith were removed by security. After the arrest, the State University of New York at New Paltz canceled a Chili Peppers concert. Flea and Smith pled guilty to all charges. They were each sentenced to pay a $1,000 fine, plus $300 to the State Attorney&#x27;s Office for prosecution costs and $5,000 to the Volusia County Rape Crisis Center, and ordered to write letters of apology to the woman. In a 1992 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Flea said: &quot;I wish I&#x27;d never done it, and it was a really stupid thing to do. I was out of control. But I did not assault anybody, and it was not sexual. It had nothing to do with sex.&quot;

In 2016, Julie Farman, a former music executive, alleged that two members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers pressed themselves against her and &quot;told me about all of the ways we could make a super sexy sandwich&quot; after a meeting with them at Epic Records in 1990.

<text>A relay is an electrically operated switch. It consists of a set of input terminals for a single or multiple control signals, and a set of operating contact terminals. The switch may have any number of contacts in multiple contact forms, such as make contacts, break contacts, or combinations thereof.

Relays are used where it is necessary to control a circuit by an independent low-power signal, or where several circuits must be controlled by one signal. Relays were first used in long-distance telegraph circuits as signal repeaters: they refresh the signal coming in from one circuit by transmitting it on another circuit. Relays were used extensively in telephone exchanges and early computers to perform logical operations.

The traditional electromechanical form of a relay uses an electromagnet to close or open the contacts, but relays using other operating principles have also been invented, such as in solid-state relays which use semiconductor properties for control without relying on moving parts. Relays with calibrated operating characteristics and sometimes multiple operating coils are used to protect electrical circuits from overload or faults; in modern electric power systems these functions are performed by digital instruments still called &quot;protective relays&quot; or &quot;safety relays&quot;.

Latching relays require only a single pulse of control power to operate the switch persistently. Another pulse applied to a second set of control terminals, or a pulse with opposite polarity, resets the switch, while repeated pulses of the same kind have no effects. Magnetic latching relays are useful in applications when interrupted power should not affect the circuits that the relay is controlling.

== History ==

In 1809 an electrolytic relay was designed as an alarm for an electrochemical telegraph by Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring.

Electrical relays got their start mainly in application to telegraphs. American scientist Joseph Henry is often cited to have invented a relay in 1835 in order to improve his version of the electrical telegraph, developed earlier in 1831. However, Henry never published any of these experiments and dating for his relay experiments is based solely on the words of Henry himself and his students, often decades later.

In March 1837 Edward Davy deposited a letter with the British Secretary for the Society of Arts containing his ideas for an electromagnetic relay, which, even if it was not the first, was considered more practical than previous designs, being a ‘make-and-break’ type rather than being based on the use of mercury. He did this two months before Charles Wheatstone and William Cooke filed their first patent for their telegraph system and would file a patent for the same idea a year later.

However, an official patent was not issued until 1840 to Samuel Morse for his telegraph, which is now called a relay. The mechanism described acted as a digital amplifier, repeating the telegraph signal, and thus allowing signals to be propagated as far as desired.

The word &quot;relay&quot; appears in the context of electromagnetic operations from 1860 onwards.

== Basic design and operation ==


A simple electromagnetic relay consists of a coil of wire wrapped around a soft iron core (a solenoid), an iron yoke which provides a low reluctance path for magnetic flux, a movable iron armature, and one or more sets of contacts (there are two contacts in the relay pictured). The armature is hinged to the yoke and mechanically linked to one or more sets of moving contacts. The armature is held in place by a spring so that when the relay is de-energized there is an air gap in the magnetic circuit. In this condition, one of the two sets of contacts in the relay pictured is closed, and the other set is open. Other relays may have more or fewer sets of contacts depending on their function. The relay in the picture also has a wire connecting the armature to the yoke. This ensures continuity of the circuit between the moving contacts on the armature, and the circuit track on the printed circuit board (PCB) via the yoke, which is soldered to the PCB.

When an electric current is passed through the coil it generates a magnetic field that activates the armature, and the consequent movement of the movable contact(s) either makes or breaks (depending upon construction) a connection with a fixed contact. If the set of contacts was closed when the relay was de-energized, then the movement opens the contacts and breaks the connection, and vice versa if the contacts were open. When the current to the coil is switched off, the armature is returned by a force, approximately half as strong as the magnetic force, to its relaxed position. Usually this force is provided by a spring, but gravity is also used commonly in industrial motor starters. Most relays are manufactured to operate quickly. In a low-voltage application this reduces noise; in a high voltage or current application it reduces arcing.

When the coil is energized with direct current, a flyback diode or snubber resistor is often placed across the coil to dissipate the energy from the collapsing magnetic field (back EMF) at deactivation, which would otherwise generate a voltage spike dangerous to semiconductor circuit components. Such diodes were not widely used before the application of transistors as relay drivers, but soon became ubiquitous as early germanium transistors were easily destroyed by this surge. Some automotive relays include a diode inside the relay case. Resistors, while more durable than diodes, are less efficient at eliminating voltage spikes generated by relays and therefore not as commonly used.

If the relay is driving a large, or especially a reactive load, there may be a similar problem of surge currents around the relay output contacts. In this case a snubber circuit (a capacitor and resistor in series) across the contacts may absorb the surge. Suitably rated capacitors and the associated resistor are sold as a single packaged component for this commonplace use.

If the coil is designed to be energized with alternating current (AC), some method is used to split the flux into two out-of-phase components which add together, increasing the minimum pull on the armature during the AC cycle. Typically this is done with a small copper &quot;shading ring&quot; crimped around a portion of the core that creates the delayed, out-of-phase component, which holds the contacts during the zero crossings of the control voltage.

Contact materials for relays vary by application. Materials with low contact resistance may be oxidized by the air, or may tend to &quot;stick&quot; instead of cleanly parting when opening. Contact material may be optimized for low electrical resistance, high strength to withstand repeated operations, or high capacity to withstand the heat of an arc. Where very low resistance is required, or low thermally-induced voltages are desired, gold-plated contacts may be used, along with palladium and other non-oxidizing, semi-precious metals. Silver or silver-plated contacts are used for signal switching. Mercury-wetted relays make and break circuits using a thin, self-renewing film of liquid mercury. For higher-power relays switching many amperes, such as motor circuit contactors, contacts are made with a mixtures of silver and cadmium oxide, providing low contact resistance and high resistance to the heat of arcing. Contacts used in circuits carrying scores or hundreds of amperes may include additional structures for heat dissipation and management of the arc produced when interrupting the circuit. Some relays have field-replaceable contacts, such as certain machine tool relays; these may be replaced when worn out, or changed between normally open and normally closed state, to allow for changes in the controlled circuit.

== Terminology ==
Since relays are switches, the terminology applied to switches is also applied to relays; a relay switches one or more &quot;poles&quot;, each of whose contacts can be &quot;thrown&quot; by energizing the coil. Normally open (NO) contacts connect the circuit when the relay is activated; the circuit is disconnected when the relay is inactive. Normally closed (NC) contacts disconnect the circuit when the relay is activated; the circuit is connected when the relay is inactive. All of the contact forms involve combinations of NO and NC connections.

The National Association of Relay Manufacturers and its successor, the Relay and Switch Industry Association define 23 distinct electrical contact forms found in relays and switches. Of these, the following are commonly encountered:

* &quot;SPST-NO&quot; (Single-Pole Single-Throw, Normally-Open) relays have a single &quot;Form A&quot; or &quot;make&quot; contact. These have two terminals which can be connected or disconnected. Including two for the coil, such a relay has four terminals in total.
* &quot;SPST-NC&quot; (Single-Pole Single-Throw, Normally-Closed) relays have a single &quot;Form B&quot; or &quot;break&quot; contact. As with an SPST-NO relay, such a relay has four terminals in total.
* &quot;SPDT&quot; (Single-Pole Double-Throw) relays have a single set of &quot;Form C&quot;, &quot;break before make&quot; or &quot;transfer&quot; contacts. That is, a common terminal connects to either of two others, never connecting to both at the same time. Including two for the coil, such a relay has a total of five terminals.
* &quot;DPST&quot; – Double-Pole Single-Throw relays are equivalent to a pair of SPST switches or relays actuated by a single coil. Including two for the coil, such a relay has a total of six terminals. The poles may be &quot;Form A&quot; or &quot;Form B&quot; (or one of each; the designations &quot;NO&quot; and &quot;NC&quot; should be used to resolve the ambiguity).
* &quot;DPDT&quot; – Double-Pole Double-Throw relays have two sets of &quot;Form C&quot; contacts. These are equivalent to two SPDT switches or relays actuated by a single coil. Such a relay has eight terminals, including the coil
* Form D – make before break
* Form E – combination of D and B

The &quot;S&quot; (&quot;single&quot;) or &quot;D&quot; (&quot;double&quot;) designator for the pole count may be replaced with a number, indicating multiple contacts connected to a single actuator. For example, 4PDT indicates a four-pole double-throw relay that has 12 switching terminals.

&quot;EN 50005&quot; are among applicable standards for relay terminal numbering; a typical EN 50005-compliant SPDT relay&#x27;s terminals would be numbered 11, 12, 14, A1 and A2 for the C, NC, NO, and coil connections, respectively.

DIN 72552 defines contact numbers in relays for automotive use:

* 85 = relay coil -
* 86 = relay coil +
* 87 = to load (normally open)
* 87a = to load (normally closed)
* 30 = battery +

== Types ==
=== Coaxial relay ===

Where radio transmitters and receivers share one antenna, often a coaxial relay is used as a TR (transmit-receive) relay, which switches the antenna from the receiver to the transmitter. This protects the receiver from the high power of the transmitter. Such relays are often used in transceivers which combine transmitter and receiver in one unit. The relay contacts are designed not to reflect any radio frequency power back toward the source, and to provide very high isolation between receiver and transmitter terminals. The characteristic impedance of the relay is matched to the transmission line impedance of the system, for example, 50 ohms.

=== Contactor ===

A contactor is a heavy-duty relay with higher current ratings, used for switching electric motors and lighting loads. Continuous current ratings for common contactors range from 10 amps to several hundred amps. High-current contacts are made with alloys containing silver. The unavoidable arcing causes the contacts to oxidize; however, silver oxide is still a good conductor. Contactors with overload protection devices are often used to start motors.

=== Force-guided contacts relay ===

A force-guided contacts relay has relay contacts that are mechanically linked together, so that when the relay coil is energized or de-energized, all of the linked contacts move together. If one set of contacts in the relay becomes immobilized, no other contact of the same relay will be able to move. The function of force-guided contacts is to enable the safety circuit to check the status of the relay. Force-guided contacts are also known as &quot;positive-guided contacts&quot;, &quot;captive contacts&quot;, &quot;locked contacts&quot;, &quot;mechanically linked contacts&quot;, or &quot;safety relays&quot;.

These safety relays have to follow design rules and manufacturing rules that are defined in one main machinery standard EN 50205 : Relays with forcibly guided (mechanically linked) contacts. These rules for the safety design are the one defined in type B standards such as EN 13849-2 as Basic safety principles and Well-tried safety principles for machinery that applies to all machines.

Force-guided contacts by themselves can not guarantee that all contacts are in the same state, however, they do guarantee, subject to no gross mechanical fault, that no contacts are in opposite states. Otherwise, a relay with several normally open (NO) contacts may stick when energized, with some contacts closed and others still slightly open, due to mechanical tolerances. Similarly, a relay with several normally closed (NC) contacts may stick to the unenergized position, so that when energized, the circuit through one set of contacts is broken, with a marginal gap, while the other remains closed. By introducing both NO and NC contacts, or more commonly, changeover contacts, on the same relay, it then becomes possible to guarantee that if any NC contact is closed, all NO contacts are open, and conversely, if any NO contact is closed, all NC contacts are open. It is not possible to reliably ensure that any particular contact is closed, except by potentially intrusive and safety-degrading sensing of its circuit conditions, however in safety systems it is usually the NO state that is most important, and as explained above, this is reliably verifiable by detecting the closure of a contact of opposite sense.

Force-guided contact relays are made with different main contact sets, either NO, NC or changeover, and one or more auxiliary contact sets, often of reduced current or voltage rating, used for the monitoring system. Contacts may be all NO, all NC, changeover, or a mixture of these, for the monitoring contacts, so that the safety system designer can select the correct configuration for the particular application. Safety relays are used as part of an engineered safety system.

=== Latching relay ===
A latching relay, also called &quot;impulse&quot;, &quot;bistable&quot;, &quot;keep&quot;, or &quot;stay&quot; relay, or simply &quot;latch&quot;, maintains either contact position indefinitely without power applied to the coil. The advantage is that one coil consumes power only for an instant while the relay is being switched, and the relay contacts retain this setting across a power outage. A latching relay allows remote control of building lighting without the hum that may be produced from a continuously (AC) energized coil.

In one mechanism, two opposing coils with an over-center spring or permanent magnet hold the contacts in position after the coil is de-energized. A pulse to one coil turns the relay on, and a pulse to the opposite coil turns the relay off. This type is widely used where control is from simple switches or single-ended outputs of a control system, and such relays are found in avionics and numerous industrial applications.

Another latching type has a remanent core that retains the contacts in the operated position by the remanent magnetism in the core. This type requires a current pulse of opposite polarity to release the contacts. A variation uses a permanent magnet that produces part of the force required to close the contact; the coil supplies sufficient force to move the contact open or closed by aiding or opposing the field of the permanent magnet. A polarity controlled relay needs changeover switches or an H-bridge drive circuit to control it. The relay may be less expensive than other types, but this is partly offset by the increased costs in the external circuit.

In another type, a &quot;ratchet relay&quot; has a ratchet mechanism that holds the contacts closed after the coil is momentarily energized. A second impulse, in the same or a separate coil, releases the contacts. This type may be found in certain cars, for headlamp dipping and other functions where alternating operation on each switch actuation is needed.

A stepping relay is a specialized kind of multi-way latching relay designed for early automatic telephone exchanges.

An earth-leakage circuit breaker includes a specialized latching relay.

Very early computers often stored bits in a magnetically latching relay, such as ferreed or the later remreed in the 1ESS switch.

Some early computers used ordinary relays as a kind of latch—they store bits in ordinary wire-spring relays or reed relays by feeding an output wire back as an input, resulting in a feedback loop or sequential circuit. Such an electrically latching relay requires continuous power to maintain state, unlike magnetically latching relays or mechanically ratcheting relays. While &quot;(self-)holding circuits&quot; are often realized with relays they can also be implemented by other means.

In computer memories, latching relays and other relays were replaced by delay-line memory, which in turn was replaced by a series of ever faster and ever smaller memory technologies.

=== Machine tool relay ===

A machine tool relay is a type standardized for industrial control of machine tools, transfer machines, and other sequential control. They are characterized by a large number of contacts (sometimes extendable in the field) which are easily converted from normally open to normally closed status, easily replaceable coils, and a form factor that allows compactly installing many relays in a control panel. Although such relays once were the backbone of automation in such industries as automobile assembly, the programmable logic controller (PLC) mostly displaced the machine tool relay from sequential control applications.

A relay allows circuits to be switched by electrical equipment: for example, a timer circuit with a relay could switch power at a preset time. For many years relays were the standard method of controlling industrial electronic systems. A number of relays could be used together to carry out complex functions (relay logic). The principle of relay logic is based on relays which energize and de-energize associated contacts. Relay logic is the predecessor of ladder logic, which is commonly used in programmable logic controllers.

=== Mercury relay ===

A mercury relay is a relay that uses mercury as the switching element. They are used where contact erosion would be a problem for conventional relay contacts. Owing to environmental considerations about significant amount of mercury used and modern alternatives, they are now comparatively uncommon.

=== Mercury-wetted relay ===
A mercury-wetted reed relay is a form of reed relay that employs a mercury switch, in which the contacts are wetted with mercury. Mercury reduces the contact resistance and mitigates the associated voltage drop. Surface contamination may result in poor conductivity for low-current signals. For high-speed applications, the mercury eliminates contact bounce, and provides virtually instantaneous circuit closure. Mercury wetted relays are position-sensitive and must be mounted according to the manufacturer&#x27;s specifications. Because of the toxicity and expense of liquid mercury, these relays have increasingly fallen into disuse.

The high speed of switching action of the mercury-wetted relay is a notable advantage. The mercury globules on each contact coalesce, and the current rise time through the contacts is generally considered to be a few picoseconds. However, in a practical circuit it may be limited by the inductance of the contacts and wiring. It was quite common, before restrictions on the use of mercury, to use a mercury-wetted relay in the laboratory as a convenient means of generating fast rise time pulses, however although the rise time may be picoseconds, the exact timing of the event is, like all other types of relay, subject to considerable jitter, possibly milliseconds, due to mechanical variations.

The same coalescence process causes another effect, which is a nuisance in some applications. The contact resistance is not stable immediately after contact closure, and drifts, mostly downwards, for several seconds after closure, the change perhaps being 0.5 ohm.

=== Multi-voltage relays ===

Multi-voltage relays are devices designed to work for wide voltage ranges such as 24 to 240 VAC and VDC and wide frequency ranges such as 0 to 300 Hz. They are indicated for use in installations that do not have stable supply voltages.

=== Overload protection relay ===

Electric motors need overcurrent protection to prevent damage from over-loading the motor, or to protect against short circuits in connecting cables or internal faults in the motor windings. The overload sensing devices are a form of heat operated relay where a coil heats a bimetallic strip, or where a solder pot melts, to operate auxiliary contacts. These auxiliary contacts are in series with the motor&#x27;s contactor coil, so they turn off the motor when it overheats.

This thermal protection operates relatively slowly allowing the motor to draw higher starting currents before the protection relay will trip. Where the overload relay is exposed to the same ambient temperature as the motor, a useful though crude compensation for motor ambient temperature is provided.

The other common overload protection system uses an electromagnet coil in series with the motor circuit that directly operates contacts. This is similar to a control relay but requires a rather high fault current to operate the contacts. To prevent short over current spikes from causing nuisance triggering the armature movement is damped with a dashpot. The thermal and magnetic overload detections are typically used together in a motor protection relay.

Electronic overload protection relays measure motor current and can estimate motor winding temperature using a &quot;thermal model&quot; of the motor armature system that can be set to provide more accurate motor protection. Some motor protection relays include temperature detector inputs for direct measurement from a thermocouple or resistance thermometer sensor embedded in the winding.

=== Polarized relay ===

A polarized relay places the armature between the poles of a permanent magnet to increase sensitivity. Polarized relays were used in middle 20th Century telephone exchanges to detect faint pulses and correct telegraphic distortion.

=== Reed relay ===
A reed relay is a reed switch enclosed in a solenoid. The switch has a set of contacts inside an evacuated or inert gas-filled glass tube that protects the contacts against atmospheric corrosion; the contacts are made of magnetic material that makes them move under the influence of the field of the enclosing solenoid or an external magnet.

Reed relays can switch faster than larger relays and require very little power from the control circuit. However, they have relatively low switching current and voltage ratings. Though rare, the reeds can become magnetized over time, which makes them stick &quot;on&quot;, even when no current is present; changing the orientation of the reeds or degaussing the switch with respect to the solenoid&#x27;s magnetic field can resolve this problem.

Sealed contacts with mercury-wetted contacts have longer operating lives and less contact chatter than any other kind of relay.

=== Safety relays ===

Safety relays are devices which generally implement protection functions. In the event of a hazard, the task of such a safety function is to use appropriate measures to reduce the existing risk to an acceptable level.

=== Solid-state contactor ===

A solid-state contactor is a heavy-duty solid state relay, including the necessary heat sink, used where frequent on-off cycles are required, such as with electric heaters, small electric motors, and lighting loads. There are no moving parts to wear out and there is no contact bounce due to vibration. They are activated by AC control signals or DC control signals from programmable logic controllers (PLCs), PCs, transistor-transistor logic (TTL) sources, or other microprocessor and microcontroller controls.

=== Solid-state relay ===

A solid-state relay (SSR) is a solid state electronic component that provides a function similar to an electromechanical relay but does not have any moving components, increasing long-term reliability. A solid-state relay uses a thyristor, TRIAC or other solid-state switching device, activated by the control signal, to switch the controlled load, instead of a solenoid. An optocoupler (a light-emitting diode (LED) coupled with a photo transistor) can be used to isolate control and controlled circuits.

=== Static relay ===

A static relay consists of electronic circuitry to emulate all those characteristics which are achieved by moving parts in an electro-magnetic relay.

=== Time-delay relay ===

Timing relays are arranged for an intentional delay in operating their contacts. A very short (a fraction of a second) delay would use a copper disk between the armature and moving blade assembly. Current flowing in the disk maintains a magnetic field for a short time, lengthening release time. For a slightly longer (up to a minute) delay, a dashpot is used. A dashpot is a piston filled with fluid that is allowed to escape slowly; both air-filled and oil-filled dashpots are used. The time period can be varied by increasing or decreasing the flow rate. For longer time periods, a mechanical clockwork timer is installed. Relays may be arranged for a fixed timing period, or may be field-adjustable, or remotely set from a control panel. Modern microprocessor-based timing relays provide precision timing over a great range.

Some relays are constructed with a kind of &quot;shock absorber&quot; mechanism attached to the armature, which prevents immediate, full motion when the coil is either energized or de-energized. This addition gives the relay the property of time-delay actuation. Time-delay relays can be constructed to delay armature motion on coil energization, de-energization, or both.

Time-delay relay contacts must be specified not only as either normally open or normally closed, but whether the delay operates in the direction of closing or in the direction of opening. The following is a description of the four basic types of time-delay relay contacts.

First, we have the normally open, timed-closed (NOTC) contact. This type of contact is normally open when the coil is unpowered (de-energized). The contact is closed by the application of power to the relay coil, but only after the coil has been continuously powered for the specified amount of time. In other words, the direction of the contact&#x27;s motion (either to close or to open) is identical to a regular NO contact, but there is a delay in closing direction. Because the delay occurs in the direction of coil energization, this type of contact is alternatively known as a normally open, on-delay.

=== Vacuum relays ===

A vacuum relay is a sensitive relay having its contacts mounted in an evacuated glass housing, to permit handling radio-frequency voltages as high as 20,000 volts without flashover between contacts even though contact spacing is as low as a few hundredths of an inch when open.

== Applications ==
Relays are used wherever it is necessary to control a high power or high voltage circuit with a low power circuit, especially when galvanic isolation is desirable. The first application of relays was in long telegraph lines, whereas the weak signal received at an intermediate station could control a contact, regenerating the signal for further transmission. High-voltage or high-current devices can be controlled with small, low voltage wiring and pilots switches. Operators can be isolated from the high voltage circuit. Low power devices such as microprocessors can drive relays to control electrical loads beyond their direct drive capability. In an automobile, a starter relay allows the high current of the cranking motor to be controlled with small wiring and contacts in the ignition key.

Electromechanical switching systems including Strowger and crossbar telephone exchanges made extensive use of relays in ancillary control circuits. The Relay Automatic Telephone Company also manufactured telephone exchanges based solely on relay switching techniques designed by Gotthilf Ansgarius Betulander. The first public relay based telephone exchange in the UK was installed in Fleetwood on 15 July 1922 and remained in service until 1959.

The use of relays for the logical control of complex switching systems like telephone exchanges was studied by Claude Shannon, who formalized the application of Boolean algebra to relay circuit design in &quot;A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits&quot;. Relays can perform the basic operations of Boolean combinatorial logic. For example, the Boolean AND function is realised by connecting normally open relay contacts in series, the OR function by connecting normally open contacts in parallel. Inversion of a logical input can be done with a normally closed contact. Relays were used for control of automated systems for machine tools and production lines. The Ladder programming language is often used for designing relay logic networks.

Early electro-mechanical computers such as the ARRA, Harvard Mark II, Zuse Z2, and Zuse Z3 used relays for logic and working registers. However, electronic devices proved faster and easier to use.

Relays are much more resistant than semiconductors to nuclear radiation, so they are widely used in safety-critical logic, such as the control panels of radioactive waste-handling machinery. Electromechanical protective relays are used to detect overload and other faults on electrical lines by opening and closing circuit breakers.

=== Protective relays ===
For protection of electrical apparatus and transmission lines, electromechanical relays with accurate operating characteristics were used to detect overload, short-circuits, and other faults. While many such relays remain in use, digital protective relays now provide equivalent and more complex protective functions.

=== Railway signaling ===
Railway signalling relays are large considering the mostly small voltages (less than 120 V) and currents (perhaps 100 mA) that they switch. Contacts are widely spaced to prevent flashovers and short circuits over a lifetime that may exceed fifty years.

Since rail signal circuits must be highly reliable, special techniques are used to detect and prevent failures in the relay system. To protect against false feeds, double switching relay contacts are often used on both the positive and negative side of a circuit, so that two false feeds are needed to cause a false signal. Not all relay circuits can be proved so there is reliance on construction features such as carbon to silver contacts to resist lightning induced contact welding and to provide AC immunity.

Opto-isolators are also used in some instances with railway signalling, especially where only a single contact is to be switched.

=== Selection considerations ===
Selection of an appropriate relay for a particular application requires evaluation of many different factors:

* Number and type of contacts — normally open, normally closed, (double-throw)
* Contact sequence — &quot;make before break&quot; or &quot;break before make&quot;. For example, the old style telephone exchanges required make-before-break so that the connection did not get dropped while dialing the number.
* Contact current rating — small relays switch a few amperes, large contactors are rated for up to 3000 amperes, alternating or direct current
* Contact voltage rating — typical control relays rated 300 VAC or 600 VAC, automotive types to 50 VDC, special high-voltage relays to about 15,000 V
* Operating lifetime, useful life — the number of times the relay can be expected to operate reliably. There is both a mechanical life and a contact life. The contact life is affected by the type of load switched. Breaking load current causes undesired arcing between the contacts, eventually leading to contacts that weld shut or contacts that fail due to erosion by the arc.
* Coil voltage — machine-tool relays usually 24 VDC, 120 or 250 VAC, relays for switchgear may have 125 V or 250 VDC coils, 
* Coil current — Minimum current required for reliable operation and minimum holding current, as well as effects of power dissipation on coil temperature at various duty cycles. &quot;Sensitive&quot; relays operate on a few milliamperes.
* Package/enclosure — open, touch-safe, double-voltage for isolation between circuits, explosion proof, outdoor, oil and splash resistant, washable for printed circuit board assembly
* Operating environment — minimum and maximum operating temperature and other environmental considerations, such as effects of humidity and salt
* Assembly — Some relays feature a sticker that keeps the enclosure sealed to allow PCB post soldering cleaning, which is removed once assembly is complete.
* Mounting — sockets, plug board, rail mount, panel mount, through-panel mount, enclosure for mounting on walls or equipment
* Switching time — where high speed is required
* &quot;Dry&quot; contacts — when switching very low level signals, special contact materials may be needed such as gold-plated contacts
* Contact protection — suppress arcing in very inductive circuits
* Coil protection — suppress the surge voltage produced when switching the coil current
* Isolation between coil contacts
* Aerospace or radiation-resistant testing, special quality assurance
* Expected mechanical loads due to acceleration — some relays used in aerospace applications are designed to function in shock loads of 50 &quot;g&quot;, or more.
* Size — smaller relays often resist mechanical vibration and shock better than larger relays, because of the lower inertia of the moving parts and the higher natural frequencies of smaller parts. Larger relays often handle higher voltage and current than smaller relays.
* Accessories such as timers, auxiliary contacts, pilot lamps, and test buttons.
* Regulatory approvals.
* Stray magnetic linkage between coils of adjacent relays on a printed circuit board.
There are many considerations involved in the correct selection of a control relay for a particular application, including factors such as speed of operation, sensitivity, and hysteresis. Although typical control relays operate in the 5 ms to 20 ms range, relays with switching speeds as fast as 100 μs are available. Reed relays which are actuated by low currents and switch fast are suitable for controlling small currents.

As with any switch, the contact current (unrelated to the coil current) must not exceed a given value to avoid damage. In high-inductance circuits such as motors, other issues must be addressed. When an inductance is connected to a power source, an input surge current or electromotor starting current larger than the steady-state current exists. When the circuit is broken, the current cannot change instantaneously, which creates a potentially damaging arc across the separating contacts.

Consequently, for relays used to control inductive loads, we must specify the maximum current that may flow through the relay contacts when it actuates, the &quot;make rating&quot;; the continuous rating; and the &quot;break rating&quot;. The make rating may be several times larger than the continuous rating, which is larger than the break rating.

== Safety and reliability ==
Switching while &quot;wet&quot; (under load) causes undesired arcing between the contacts, eventually leading to contacts that weld shut or contacts that fail due to a buildup of surface damage caused by the destructive arc energy.

Inside the Number One Electronic Switching System (1ESS) crossbar switch and certain other high-reliability designs, the reed switches are always switched &quot;dry&quot; (without load) to avoid that problem, leading to much longer contact life.

Without adequate contact protection, the occurrence of electric current arcing causes significant degradation of the contacts, which suffer significant and visible damage. Every time the relay contacts open or close under load, an electrical arc can occur between the contacts of the relay, either a &quot;break&quot; arc (when opening), or a &quot;make&quot; / &quot;bounce&quot; arc (when closing). In many situations, the &quot;break&quot; arc is more energetic and thus more destructive, in particular with inductive loads, but this can be mitigated by bridging the contacts with a snubber circuit. The inrush current of tungsten filament incandescent lamps is typically ten times the normal operating current. Thus, relays intended for tungsten loads may use special contact composition, or the relay may have lower contact ratings for tungsten loads than for purely resistive loads.
An electrical arc across relay contacts can be very hot — thousands of degrees Fahrenheit — causing the metal on the contact surfaces to melt, pool, and migrate with the current. The extremely high temperature of the arc splits the surrounding gas molecules, creating ozone, carbon monoxide, and other compounds. Over time, the arc energy slowly destroys the contact metal, causing some material to escape into the air as fine particulate matter. This action causes the material in the contacts to degrade and coordination, resulting in device failure. This contact degradation drastically limits the overall life of a relay to a range of about 10,000 to 100,000 operations, a level far below the mechanical life of the device, which can be in excess of 20 million operations.

<text>Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a country in Southwestern Europe with territories in North Africa. Featuring the southernmost point of continental Europe, it is the largest country in Southern Europe and the fourth-most populous European Union member state. Spanning across the majority of the Iberian Peninsula, its territory also includes the Canary Islands, in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean, the Balearic Islands, in the Western Mediterranean Sea, and the autonomous cities of Ceuta and Melilla, in Africa. Peninsular Spain is bordered to the north by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; to the east and south by the Mediterranean Sea and Gibraltar; and to the west by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. Spain&#x27;s capital and largest city is Madrid, and other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Zaragoza, Málaga, Murcia and Palma de Mallorca.

In early antiquity, the Iberian Peninsula was inhabited by Celts, Iberians, and other pre-Roman peoples. With the Roman conquest of the Iberian peninsula, the province of Hispania was established. Following the Romanisation and Christianisation of Hispania, the fall of the Western Roman Empire ushered in the inward migration of tribes from Central Europe, including the Visigoths, who formed the Visigothic Kingdom centred on Toledo. In the early eighth century, most of the peninsula was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate, and during early Islamic rule, Al-Andalus became a dominant peninsular power centred on Córdoba. The several Christian kingdoms that emerged in Northern Iberia, chief among them Asturias, León, Castile, Aragon and Navarre, made an intermittent southward military expansion and repopulation, known as the &quot;Reconquista&quot;, repelling Islamic rule in Iberia, which culminated with the Christian seizure of the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada in 1492. The dynastic union of the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1479 under the Catholic Monarchs is often considered the &quot;de facto&quot; unification of Spain as a nation state.

During the Age of Discovery, Spain pioneered the exploration and conquest of the New World, made the first circumnavigation of the globe and formed one of the largest empires in history. The Spanish Empire reached a global scale and spread across all continents, underpinning the rise of a global trading system fueled primarily by precious metals. In the 18th century, the Bourbon Reforms, particularly the Nueva Planta decrees, centralized mainland Spain, strengthening royal authority and modernizing administrative structures. In the 19th century, after the victorious Peninsular War against Napoleonic occupation forces, the following political divisions between liberals and absolutists led to the breakaway of most of the American colonies. These political divisions finally converged in the 20th century with the Spanish Civil War, giving rise to the Francoist dictatorship that lasted until 1975. With the restoration of democracy and its entry into the European Union, the country experienced an economic boom that profoundly transformed it socially and politically. Since the Spanish Golden Age, Spanish art, architecture, music, poetry, painting, literature, and cuisine have been influential worldwide, particularly in Western Europe and the Americas. As a reflection of its large cultural wealth, Spain is the world&#x27;s second-most visited country, has one of the world&#x27;s largest numbers of World Heritage Sites, and it is the most popular destination for European students. Its cultural influence extends to over 600 million Hispanophones, making Spanish the world&#x27;s second-most spoken native language and the world&#x27;s most widely spoken Romance language.

Spain is a secular parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy, with King Felipe VI as head of state. A developed country, it is a major advanced capitalist economy, with the world&#x27;s fifteenth-largest by both nominal GDP and PPP-adjusted GDP. It is also currently the fourth largest economy in the European Union. Spain is a member of the United Nations, the European Union, the eurozone, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), a permanent guest of the G20, and is part of many other international organisations such as the Council of Europe (CoE), the Organisation of Ibero-American States (OEI), the Union for the Mediterranean, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

== Etymology ==
The name of Spain (&quot;España&quot;) comes from &quot;Hispania&quot;, the name used by the Romans for the Iberian Peninsula and its provinces during the Roman Empire. The etymological origin of the term Hispania is uncertain, although the Phoenicians referred to the region as &quot;i-shphan-im&quot;, possibly meaning &quot;Land of Rabbits&quot; or &quot;Land of Metals&quot;. and José Ángel Zamora, experts in Semitic philology at the Spanish National Research Council (&quot;Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas&quot;, CSIC), conducted a comparative philological study between several Semitic languages and hypothesise that the Phoenician name translates as &quot;land where metals are forged&quot;, having determined that the name originated in reference to the gold mines of the Iberian Peninsula. There have been a number of accounts and hypotheses about its origin:

Jesús Luis Cunchillos argues that the root of the term &quot;span&quot; is the Phoenician word , meaning &quot;to forge metals&quot;. Therefore, &quot;i-spn-ya&quot; would mean &quot;the land where metals are forged&quot;. It may be a derivation of the Phoenician , meaning &quot;island of rabbits&quot;, &quot;land of rabbits&quot; or &quot;edge&quot;, a reference to Spain&#x27;s location at the end of the Mediterranean; Roman coins struck in the region from the reign of Hadrian show a female figure with a rabbit at her feet, and Strabo called it the &quot;land of the rabbits&quot;. The word in question actually means &quot;Hyrax&quot;, possibly due to the Phoenicians confusing the two animals.

There is also the claim that &quot;Hispania&quot; derives from the Basque word , meaning &quot;edge&quot; or &quot;border&quot;, another reference to the fact that the Iberian Peninsula constitutes the southwest corner of the European continent.

== History ==
=== Prehistory and pre-Roman peoples ===
Archaeological research at Atapuerca indicates the Iberian Peninsula was populated by hominids 1.3 million years ago.

Modern humans first arrived in Iberia from the north on foot about 35,000 years ago. The best-known artefacts of these prehistoric human settlements are the paintings in the Altamira cave of Cantabria in northern Iberia, which were created from 35,600 to 13,500 BCE by Cro-Magnon. Archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the Iberian Peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern Europe was repopulated following the end of the last ice age.

The two largest groups inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula before the Roman conquest were the Iberians and the Celts. The Iberians inhabited the Mediterranean side of the peninsula. The Celts inhabited much of the interior and Atlantic sides of the peninsula. Basques occupied the western area of the Pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas; Phoenician-influenced Tartessians flourished in the southwest; and Lusitanians and Vettones occupied areas in the central west. Several cities were founded along the coast by Phoenicians, and trading outposts and colonies were established by Greeks in the East. Eventually, Phoenician-Carthaginians expanded inland towards the meseta; however, due to the bellicose inland tribes, the Carthaginians settled on the coasts of the Iberian Peninsula.

=== Roman Hispania and the Visigothic Kingdom ===

During the Second Punic War, roughly between 210 and 205 BCE, the expanding Roman Republic captured Carthaginian trading colonies along the Mediterranean coast. Although it took the Romans nearly two centuries to complete the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, they retained control of it for over six centuries. Roman rule was bound together by law, language, and the Roman road.

The cultures of the pre-Roman populations were gradually Romanised (Latinised) at different rates depending on what part of the peninsula they lived in, with local leaders being admitted into the Roman aristocratic class.

Hispania (the Roman name for the Iberian Peninsula) served as a granary for the Roman market, and its harbours exported gold, wool, olive oil, and wine. Agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects, some of which remain in use. Emperors Hadrian, Trajan, Theodosius I, and the philosopher Seneca were born in Hispania. Christianity was introduced into Hispania in the 1st century CE, and it became popular in the cities in the 2nd century. Most of Spain&#x27;s present languages and religions, as well as the basis of its laws, originate from this period. Starting in 170 CE, incursions of North-African Mauri in the province of Baetica took place.
The Germanic Suebi and Vandals, together with the Sarmatian Alans, entered the peninsula after 409, weakening the Western Roman Empire&#x27;s jurisdiction over Hispania. The Suebi established a kingdom in north-western Iberia, whereas the Vandals established themselves in the south of the peninsula by 420 before crossing over to North Africa in 429. As the western empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified; the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity and assimilation into the evolving Roman culture.

The Byzantines established an occidental province, Spania, in the south, with the intention of reviving Roman rule throughout Iberia. Eventually, however, Hispania was reunited under Visigothic rule.

=== Muslim era and &quot;Reconquista&quot; ===

From 711 to 718, as part of the expansion of the Umayyad Caliphate which had conquered North Africa from the Byzantine Empire, nearly all of the Iberian Peninsula was conquered by Muslims from across the Strait of Gibraltar, resulting in the collapse of the Visigothic Kingdom. Only a small area in the mountainous north of the peninsula stood out of the territory seized during the initial invasion. The Kingdom of Asturias-León consolidated upon this territory. Other Christian kingdoms, such as Navarre and Aragon in the mountainous north, eventually surged upon the consolidation of counties of the Carolingian &quot;Marca Hispanica&quot;. For several centuries, the fluctuating frontier between the Muslim and Christian-controlled areas of the peninsula was along the Ebro and Douro valleys.

Conversion to Islam proceeded at an increasing pace. The &quot;muladíes&quot; (Muslims of ethnic Iberian origin) are believed to have formed the majority of the population of Al-Andalus by the end of the 10th century.

A series of Viking incursions raided the coasts of the Iberian Peninsula in the 9th and 10th centuries. The first recorded Viking raid on Iberia took place in 844; it ended in failure with many Vikings killed by the Galicians&#x27; ballistas; and seventy of the Vikings&#x27; longships captured on the beach and burned by the troops of King Ramiro I of Asturias.

In the 11th century, the Caliphate of Córdoba collapsed, fracturing into a series of petty kingdoms (&quot;Taifas&quot;), often subject to the payment of a form of protection money (&quot;Parias&quot;) to the Northern Christian kingdoms, which otherwise undertook a southward territorial expansion. The capture of the strategic city of Toledo in 1085 marked a significant shift in the balance of power in favour of the Christian kingdoms. The arrival from North Africa of the Islamic ruling sects of the Almoravids and the Almohads achieved temporary unity upon the Muslim-ruled territory, with a stricter, less tolerant application of Islam, and partially reversed some Christian territorial gains.

The Kingdom of León was the strongest Christian kingdom for centuries. In 1188, the first form (restricted to the bishops, the magnates, and &#x27;the elected citizens of each city&#x27;) of modern parliamentary session in Europe was held in León (Cortes of León). The Kingdom of Castile, formed from Leonese territory, was its successor as strongest kingdom. The kings and the nobility fought for power and influence in this period. The example of the Roman emperors influenced the political objective of the Crown, while the nobles benefited from feudalism.

Muslim strongholds in the Guadalquivir Valley such as Córdoba (1236) and Seville (1248) fell to Castile in the 13th century. The County of Barcelona and the Kingdom of Aragon entered in a dynastic union and gained territory and power in the Mediterranean. In 1229, Majorca was conquered, so was Valencia in 1238. In the 13th and 14th centuries, the North-African Marinids established some enclaves around the Strait of Gibraltar. Upon the conclusion of the Granada War, the Nasrid Sultanate of Granada (the remaining Muslim-ruled polity in the Iberian Peninsula after 1246) capitulated in 1492 to the military strength of the Catholic Monarchs, and it was integrated from then on in the Crown of Castile.

=== Spanish Empire ===
In 1469, the crowns of the Christian kingdoms of Castile and Aragon were united by the marriage of their monarchs, Isabella I and Ferdinand II, respectively. In 1492, Jews were forced to choose between conversion to Catholicism or expulsion; as many as 200,000 Jews were expelled from Castile and Aragon. The year 1492 also marked the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the New World, during a voyage funded by Isabella. Columbus&#x27;s first voyage crossed the Atlantic and reached the Caribbean Islands, beginning the European exploration and conquest of the Americas.

The Treaty of Granada guaranteed religious tolerance towards Muslims, for a few years before Islam was outlawed in 1502 in Castile and 1527 in Aragon, leading the remaining Muslim population to become nominally Christian &quot;Moriscos&quot;. About four decades after the War of the Alpujarras (1568–1571), over 300,000 &quot;moriscos&quot; were expelled, settling primarily in North Africa.
The unification of the crowns of Aragon and Castile by the marriage of their sovereigns laid the basis for modern Spain and the Spanish Empire, although each kingdom of Spain remained a separate country socially, politically, legally, and in currency and language.

Habsburg Spain was one of the leading world powers throughout the 16th century and most of the 17th century, a position reinforced by trade and wealth from colonial possessions and became the world&#x27;s leading maritime power. It reached its apogee during the reigns of the first two Spanish Habsburgs—Charles V/I (1516–1556) and Philip II (1556–1598). This period saw the Italian Wars, the Schmalkaldic War, the Dutch Revolt, the War of the Portuguese Succession, clashes with the Ottomans, intervention in the French Wars of Religion and the Anglo-Spanish War.
Through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance, the Spanish Empire expanded across vast areas in the Americas, the Indo-Pacific, Africa as well as the European continent (including holdings in the Italian Peninsula, the Low Countries and the Franche-Comté). The so-called Age of Discovery featured explorations by sea and by land, the opening-up of new trade routes across oceans, conquests and the beginnings of European colonialism. Precious metals, spices, luxuries, and previously unknown plants brought to the metropole played a leading part in transforming the European understanding of the globe. The cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the Spanish Golden Age. The expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the Americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from Europe devastated American indigenous populations. The rise of humanism, the Counter-Reformation and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the School of Salamanca, which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as international law and human rights.

Spain&#x27;s 16th-century maritime supremacy was demonstrated by the victory over the Ottoman Empire at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571 and over Portugal at the Battle of Ponta Delgada in 1582, and then after the setback of the Spanish Armada in 1588, in a series of victories against England in the Anglo-Spanish War of 1585–1604. However, during the middle decades of the 17th century Spain&#x27;s maritime power went into a long decline with mounting defeats against the Dutch Republic (Battle of the Downs) and then England in the Anglo-Spanish War of 1654–1660; by the 1660s it was struggling to defend its overseas possessions from pirates and privateers.

The Protestant Reformation increased Spain&#x27;s involvement in religiously charged wars, forcing ever-expanding military efforts across Europe and in the Mediterranean. By the middle decades of a war- and plague-ridden 17th-century Europe, the Spanish Habsburgs had enmeshed the country in continent-wide religious-political conflicts. These conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the economy generally. Spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered Habsburg empire, and help the imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire reverse a large part of the advances made by Protestant forces, but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of Portugal and the United Provinces (Dutch Republic), and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to France in the latter stages of the immensely destructive, Europe-wide Thirty Years&#x27; War. In the latter half of the 17th century, Spain went into a gradual decline, during which it surrendered several small territories to France and England; however, it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire, which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century.

====18th century====

The decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century. The War of the Spanish Succession was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war, and was to cost the kingdom its European possessions and its position as a leading European power.

During this war, a new dynasty originating in France, the Bourbons, was installed. The Crowns of Castile and Aragon had been long united only by the Monarchy and the common institution of the Inquisition&#x27;s Holy Office. A number of reform policies (the so-called Bourbon Reforms) were pursued by the Monarchy with the overarching goal of centralised authority and administrative uniformity. They included the abolishment of many of the old regional privileges and laws, as well as the customs barrier between the Crowns of Aragon and Castile in 1717, followed by the introduction of new property taxes in the Aragonese kingdoms.

The 18th century saw a gradual recovery and an increase in prosperity through much of the empire. The predominant economic policy was an interventionist one, and the State also pursued policies aiming towards infrastructure development as well as the abolition of internal customs and the reduction of export tariffs. Projects of agricultural colonisation with new settlements took place in the south of mainland Spain. Enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom&#x27;s elite and monarchy.

=== Liberalism and nation state ===
In 1793, Spain went to war against the revolutionary new French Republic as a member of the first Coalition. The subsequent War of the Pyrenees polarised the country in a reaction against the gallicised elites and following defeat in the field, peace was made with France in 1795 at the Peace of Basel in which Spain lost control over two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola. In 1807, a secret treaty between Napoleon and the unpopular prime minister led to a new declaration of war against Britain and Portugal. French troops entered the country to invade Portugal but instead occupied Spain&#x27;s major fortresses. The Spanish king abdicated and a puppet kingdom satellite to the French Empire was installed with Joseph Bonaparte as king.

The 2 May 1808 revolt was one of many uprisings across the country against the French occupation. These revolts marked the beginning of a devastating war of independence against the Napoleonic regime. Further military action by Spanish armies, guerrilla warfare and an Anglo-Portuguese allied army, combined with Napoleon&#x27;s failure on the Russian front, led to the retreat of French imperial armies from the Iberian Peninsula in 1814, and the return of King Ferdinand VII.

During the war, in 1810, a revolutionary body, the Cortes of Cádiz, was assembled to coordinate the effort against the Bonapartist regime and to prepare a constitution. It met as one body, and its members represented the entire Spanish empire. In 1812, a constitution for universal representation under a constitutional monarchy was declared, but after the fall of the Bonapartist regime, the Spanish king dismissed the Cortes Generales, set on ruling as an absolute monarch.

The French occupation of mainland Spain created an opportunity for overseas &quot;criollo&quot; elites who resented the privilege towards Peninsular elites and demanded retroversion of the sovereignty to the people. Starting in 1809 the American colonies began a series of revolutions and declared independence, leading to the Spanish American wars of independence that put an end to the metropole&#x27;s grip over the Spanish Main. Attempts to re-assert control proved futile with opposition not only in the colonies but also in the Iberian peninsula and army revolts followed. By the end of 1826, the only American colonies Spain held were Cuba and Puerto Rico. The Napoleonic War left Spain economically ruined, deeply divided and politically unstable. In the 1830s and 1840s, Carlism (a reactionary legitimist movement supportive of an alternative Bourbon branch), fought against the government forces supportive of Queen Isabella II&#x27;s dynastic rights in the Carlist Wars. Government forces prevailed, but the conflict between &quot;progressives&quot; and &quot;moderates&quot; ended in a weak early constitutional period. The 1868 Glorious Revolution was followed by the 1868–1874 progressive &quot;Sexenio Democrático&quot; (including the short-lived First Spanish Republic), which yielded to a stable monarchic period, the Restoration (1875–1931).
In the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the Philippines and Cuba. In 1895 and 1896 the Cuban War of Independence and the Philippine Revolution broke out and eventually the United States became involved. The Spanish–American War was fought in the spring of 1898 and resulted in Spain losing the last of its once vast colonial empire outside of North Africa. &quot;El Desastre&quot; (the Disaster), as the war became known in Spain, gave added impetus to the Generation of &#x27;98. Although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity, the 20th century brought little social peace. Spain played a minor part in the scramble for Africa. It remained neutral during World War I. The heavy losses suffered by the colonial troops in conflicts in northern Morocco against Riffians forces brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy.

Industrialisation, the development of railways and incipient capitalism developed in several areas of the country, particularly in Barcelona, as well as labour movement and socialist and anarchist ideas. The 1870 Barcelona Workers&#x27; Congress and the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition are good examples of this. In 1879, the Spanish Socialist Workers&#x27; Party was founded. A trade union linked to this party, Unión General de Trabajadores, was founded in 1888. In the anarcho-syndicalist trend of the labour movement in Spain, Confederación Nacional del Trabajo was founded in 1910 and Federación Anarquista Ibérica in 1927.

Catalanism and Vasquism, alongside other nationalisms and regionalisms in Spain, arose in that period: the Basque Nationalist Party formed in 1895 and Regionalist League of Catalonia in 1901.

Political corruption and repression weakened the democratic system of the constitutional monarchy of a two-parties system. The July 1909 Tragic Week events and repression exemplified the social instability of the time.

The La Canadiense strike in 1919 led to the first law limiting the working day to eight hours.
After a period of Crown-supported dictatorship from 1923 to 1931, the first elections since 1923, largely understood as a plebiscite on Monarchy, took place: the 12 April 1931 municipal elections. These gave a resounding victory to the Republican-Socialist candidacies in large cities and provincial capitals, with a majority of monarchist councilors in rural areas. The king left the country and the proclamation of the Republic on 14 April ensued, with the formation of a provisional government.

A constitution for the country was passed in October 1931 following the June 1931 Constituent general election, and a series of cabinets presided by Manuel Azaña supported by republican parties and the PSOE followed. In the election held in 1933 the right triumphed and in 1936, the left. During the Second Republic there was a great political and social upheaval, marked by a sharp radicalisation of the left and the right. Instances of political violence during this period included the burning of churches, the 1932 failed coup d&#x27;état led by José Sanjurjo, the Revolution of 1934 and numerous attacks against rival political leaders. On the other hand, it is also during the Second Republic when important reforms to modernise the country were initiated: a democratic constitution, agrarian reform, restructuring of the army, political decentralisation and women&#x27;s right to vote.

=== Civil War and Francoist dictatorship ===

The Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936: on 17 and 18 July, part of the military carried out a coup d&#x27;état that triumphed in only part of the country. The situation led to a civil war, in which the territory was divided into two zones: one under the authority of the Republican government, that counted on outside support from the Soviet Union and Mexico (and from International Brigades), and the other controlled by the putschists (the Nationalist or rebel faction), most critically supported by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The Republic was not supported by the Western powers due to the British-led policy of non-intervention. General Francisco Franco was sworn in as the supreme leader of the rebels on 1 October 1936. An uneasy relationship between the Republican government and the grassroots anarchists who had initiated a partial social revolution also ensued.

The civil war was viciously fought and there were many atrocities committed by all sides. The war claimed the lives of over 500,000 people and caused the flight of up to a half-million citizens from the country. On 1 April 1939, five months before the beginning of World War II, the rebel side led by Franco emerged victorious, imposing a dictatorship over the whole country. Thousands were imprisoned after the civil war in Francoist concentration camps.

The regime remained nominally &quot;neutral&quot; for much of the Second World War, although it was sympathetic to the Axis and provided the Nazi Wehrmacht with Spanish volunteers in the Eastern Front. The only legal party under Franco&#x27;s dictatorship was the Falange Española Tradicionalista y de las JONS (FET y de las JONS), formed in 1937 upon the merging of the Fascist Falange Española de las JONS and the Carlist traditionalists and to which the rest of right-wing groups supporting the rebels also added. The name of &quot;Movimiento Nacional&quot;, sometimes understood as a wider structure than the FET y de las JONS proper, largely imposed over the later&#x27;s name in official documents along the 1950s.

After the war Spain was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations. This changed in 1955, during the Cold War period, when it became strategically important for the US to establish a military presence on the Iberian Peninsula as a counter to any possible move by the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean basin. US Cold War strategic priorities included the dissemination of American educational ideas to foster modernization and expansion. In the 1960s, Spain registered an unprecedented rate of economic growth which was propelled by industrialisation, a mass internal migration from rural areas to Madrid, Barcelona and the Basque Country and the creation of a mass tourism industry. Franco&#x27;s rule was also characterised by authoritarianism, promotion of a unitary national identity, National Catholicism, and discriminatory language policies.

=== Restoration of democracy ===
In 1962, a group of politicians involved in the opposition to Franco&#x27;s regime inside the country and in exile met in the congress of the European Movement in Munich, where they made a resolution in favour of democracy.

With Franco&#x27;s death in November 1975, Juan Carlos succeeded to the position of King of Spain and head of state in accordance with the Francoist law. With the approval of the new Spanish Constitution of 1978 and the restoration of democracy, the State devolved much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on autonomous communities. The Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law let people of Franco&#x27;s regime continue inside institutions without consequences, even perpetrators of some crimes during transition to democracy like the Massacre of 3 March 1976 in Vitoria or 1977 Massacre of Atocha.

In the Basque Country, moderate Basque nationalism coexisted with a radical nationalist movement led by the armed organisation ETA until the latter&#x27;s dissolution in May 2018. The group was formed in 1959 during Franco&#x27;s rule but had continued to wage its violent campaign even after the restoration of democracy and the return of a large measure of regional autonomy.

On 23 February 1981, rebel elements among the security forces seized the Cortes in an attempt to impose a military-backed government. King Juan Carlos took personal command of the military and successfully ordered the coup plotters, via national television, to surrender.

During the 1980s the democratic restoration made possible a growing open society. New cultural movements based on freedom appeared, like La Movida Madrileña. In May 1982 Spain joined NATO, followed by a referendum after a strong social opposition. That year the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) came to power, the first left-wing government in 43 years. In 1986 Spain joined the European Economic Community, which later became the European Union. The PSOE was replaced in government by the Partido Popular (PP) in 1996 after scandals around participation of the government of Felipe González in the Dirty war against ETA.
On 1 January 2002, Spain fully adopted the euro, and Spain experienced strong economic growth, well above the EU average during the early 2000s. However, well-publicised concerns issued by many economic commentators at the height of the boom warned that extraordinary property prices and a high foreign trade deficit were likely to lead to a painful economic collapse.

In 2002, the Prestige oil spill occurred with big ecological consequences along Spain&#x27;s Atlantic coastline. In 2003 José María Aznar supported US president George W. Bush in the Iraq War, and a strong movement against war rose in Spanish society. In March 2004 a local Islamist terrorist group inspired by Al-Qaeda carried out the largest terrorist attack in Western European history when they killed 191 people and wounded more than 1,800 others by bombing commuter trains in Madrid. Though initial suspicions focused on the Basque terrorist group ETA, evidence of Islamist involvement soon emerged. Because of the proximity of the 2004 Spanish general election, the issue of responsibility quickly became a political controversy, with the main competing parties PP and PSOE exchanging accusations over the handling of the incident. The PSOE won the election, led by José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero.

In the early 2000s, the proportion of Spain&#x27;s foreign born population increased rapidly during its economic boom but then declined due to the financial crisis. In 2005, the Spanish government legalised same sex marriage, becoming the third country worldwide to do so. Decentralisation was supported with much resistance of Constitutional Court and conservative opposition, so did gender politics like quotas or the law against gender violence. Government talks with ETA happened, and the group announced its permanent cease of violence in 2010.

The bursting of the Spanish property bubble in 2008 led to the 2008–16 Spanish financial crisis. High levels of unemployment, cuts in government spending and corruption in Royal family and People&#x27;s Party served as a backdrop to the 2011–12 Spanish protests. Catalan independentism also rose. In 2011, Mariano Rajoy&#x27;s conservative People&#x27;s Party won the election with 44.6% of votes. As prime minister, he implemented austerity measures for EU bailout, the EU Stability and Growth Pact. On 19 June 2014, the monarch, Juan Carlos, abdicated in favour of his son, who became Felipe VI.

In October 2017 a Catalan independence referendum was held and the Catalan parliament voted to unilaterally declare independence from Spain to form a Catalan Republic on the day the Spanish Senate was discussing approving direct rule over Catalonia as called for by the Spanish Prime Minister. On the same day the Senate granted the power to impose direct rule and Rajoy dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a new election. No country recognised Catalonia as a separate state.
In June 2018, the Congress of Deputies passed a motion of no-confidence against Rajoy and replaced him with the PSOE leader Pedro Sánchez. In 2019, the first ever coalicion government in Spain was formed, between PSOE and Unidas Podemos. Between 2018 and 2024, Spain faced an institutional crisis surrounding the mandate of the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ), until finally the mandate got renovated. In January 2020, the COVID-19 virus was confirmed to have spread to Spain, causing life expectancy to drop by more than a year. The European Commission economic recovery package Next Generation EU were created to support the EU member states to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, and will be in use in the period 2021–2026. In March 2021, Spain became the sixth nation in the world to make active euthanasia legal. Following the general election on 23 July 2023, prime minister Pedro Sánchez once again formed a coalition government, this time with Sumar (successors of Unidas Podemos).
In 2024, the first non-independentist Catalan regional president in over a decade, Salvador Illa, was elected, normalising the constitutional and institutional relations between the national and the regional administrations. According to latest polls, only 17.3% of Catalans feel themselves as &quot;only Catalan&quot;. 46% of Catalans would answer &quot;as Spanish as Catalan&quot;, while 21.8% &quot;more Catalan than Spanish&quot;. Accordind to a 2024 poll of University of Barcelona, over 50% of Catalans would vote against independence, while less than 40% would vote in favour.

== Geography ==

At , Spain is the world&#x27;s fiftieth largest country and Europe&#x27;s fourth largest country. At , Mount Teide (Tenerife) is the highest mountain peak in Spain and is the third largest volcano in the world from its base. Spain is a transcontinental country, having territory in both Europe and Africa.

Spain lies between latitudes 27° and 44° N, and longitudes 19° W and 5° E.

On the west, Spain is bordered by Portugal; on the south, it is bordered by Gibraltar and Morocco, through its exclaves in North Africa (Ceuta and Melilla, and the peninsula of de Vélez de la Gomera). On the northeast, along the Pyrenees mountain range, it is bordered by France and Andorra. Along the Pyrenees in Girona, a small exclave town called Llívia is surrounded by France.

Extending to , the Portugal–Spain border is the longest uninterrupted border within the European Union.

=== Islands ===

Spain also includes the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea, the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean and a number of uninhabited islands on the Mediterranean side of the Strait of Gibraltar, known as (&quot;places of sovereignty&quot;, or territories under Spanish sovereignty), such as the Chafarinas Islands and Alhucemas. The peninsula of de Vélez de la Gomera is also regarded as a &quot;plaza de soberanía&quot;. The isle of Alborán, located in the Mediterranean between Spain and North Africa, is also administered by Spain, specifically by the municipality of Almería, Andalusia. The little Pheasant Island in the River Bidasoa is a Spanish-French condominium.

There are 11 major islands in Spain, all of them having their own governing bodies (Cabildos insulares in the Canaries, Consells insulars in Baleares). These islands are specifically mentioned by the Spanish Constitution, when fixing its Senatorial representation (Ibiza and Formentera are grouped, as they together form the Pityusic islands, part of the Balearic archipelago). These islands include Tenerife, Gran Canaria, Lanzarote, Fuerteventura, La Palma, La Gomera and El Hierro in the Canarian archipelago and Mallorca, Ibiza, Menorca and Formentera in the Balearic archipelago.

=== Mountains and rivers ===
Mainland Spain is a rather mountainous landmass, dominated by high plateaus and mountain chains. After the Pyrenees, the main mountain ranges are the Cordillera Cantábrica (Cantabrian Range), Sistema Ibérico (Iberian System), Sistema Central (Central System), Montes de Toledo, Sierra Morena and the Sistema Bético (Baetic System) whose highest peak, the Mulhacén, located in Sierra Nevada, is the highest elevation in the Iberian Peninsula. The highest point in Spain is the Teide, a active volcano in the Canary Islands. The Meseta Central (often translated as &#x27;Inner Plateau&#x27;) is a vast plateau in the heart of peninsular Spain split in two by the Sistema Central.

There are several major rivers in Spain such as the Tagus (&quot;Tajo&quot;), Ebro, Guadiana, Douro (&quot;Duero&quot;), Guadalquivir, Júcar, Segura, Turia and Minho (&quot;Miño&quot;). Alluvial plains are found along the coast, the largest of which is that of the Guadalquivir in Andalusia.

=== Climate ===

Three main climatic zones can be separated, according to geographical situation and orographic conditions:
* The Mediterranean climate is characterised by warm/hot and dry summers and is the predominant climate in the country. It has two varieties: &quot;Csa&quot; and &quot;Csb&quot; according to the Köppen climate classification.
** The &quot;Csa&quot; zone is associated with areas with hot summers. It is predominant in the Southern Mediterranean (except southeastern) and Southern Atlantic coast and inland throughout Andalusia, Extremadura and much of the centre of the country. Some areas of Csa, mainly those inland, such as some areas of Castilla-La-Mancha, Extremadura, Madrid and some parts of Andalusia, have cool winters with some continental influences, while the regions with a Mediterranean climate close to the sea have mild winters.
** The &quot;Csb&quot; zone has warm rather than hot summers, and extends to additional cool-winter areas not typically associated with a Mediterranean climate, such as much of central and northern-central of Spain (e.g. western Castile–León, northeastern Castilla-La Mancha and northern Madrid) and into much rainier areas (notably Galicia).
* The semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;, &quot;BSh&quot;) is predominant in the southeastern quarter of the country, but is also widespread in other areas of Spain. It covers most of the Region of Murcia, southern and central-eastern Valencia, eastern Andalusia, various areas of Castilla-La-Mancha, Madrid and some areas of Extremadura. Further to the north, it is predominant in the upper and mid reaches of the Ebro valley, which crosses southern Navarre, central Aragon and western Catalonia. It is also found in a small area in northern Andalusia and in a small area in central Castilla-León. Precipitation is limited with dry season extending beyond the summer and average temperature depends on altitude and latitude.
* The oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) is located in the northern quarter of the country, especially in the Atlantic region (Basque Country, Cantabria, Asturias, and partly Galicia and Castile–León). It is also found in northern Navarre, in most highlands areas along the Iberian System and in the Pyrenean valleys, where a humid subtropical variant (&quot;Cfa&quot;) also occurs. Winter and summer temperatures are influenced by the ocean, and have no seasonal drought.

Apart from these main types, other sub-types can be found, like the alpine climate in areas with very high altitude, the humid subtropical climate in areas of northeastern Spain and the continental climates (&quot;Dfc&quot;, &quot;Dfb&quot; / &quot;Dsc&quot;, &quot;Dsb&quot;) in the Pyrenees as well as parts of the Cantabrian Range, the Central System, Sierra Nevada and the Iberian System, and a typical desert climate (&quot;BWk&quot;, &quot;BWh&quot;) in the zone of Almería, Murcia and eastern Canary Islands. Low-lying areas of the Canary Islands average above during their coolest month, thus having influences of tropical climate, although they cannot properly be classified as tropical climates, as according to AEMET, their aridity is high, thus belonging to an arid or semi-arid climate.

Spain is one of the countries that is most affected by the climate change in Europe. In Spain, which already has a hot and dry climate, extreme events such as heatwaves are becoming increasingly frequent. The country is also experiencing more episodes of drought and increased severity of these episodes. Water resources will be severely affected in various climate change scenarios. To mitigate the effects of climate change, Spain is promoting an energy transition to renewable energies, such as solar and wind energy.

=== Fauna and flora ===

The fauna presents a wide diversity that is due in large part to the geographical position of the Iberian peninsula between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean and between Africa and Eurasia, and the great diversity of habitats and biotopes, the result of a considerable variety of climates and well differentiated regions.

The vegetation of Spain is varied due to several factors including the diversity of the terrain, the climate and latitude. Spain includes different phytogeographic regions, each with its own floral characteristics resulting largely from the interaction of climate, topography, soil type and fire, and biotic factors. The country had a 2019 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 4.23/10, ranking it 130th globally out of 172 countries.

Within the European territory, Spain has the largest number of plant species (7,600 vascular plants) of all European countries.

In Spain there are 17.804 billion trees and an average of 284 million more grow each year.

== Politics ==

The constitutional history of Spain dates back to the constitution of 1812. In June 1976, Spain&#x27;s new King Juan Carlos dismissed Carlos Arias Navarro and appointed the reformer Adolfo Suárez as Prime Minister. The resulting general election in 1977 convened the &quot;Constituent Cortes&quot; (the Spanish Parliament, in its capacity as a constitutional assembly) for the purpose of drafting and approving the constitution of 1978. After a national referendum on 6 December 1978, 88% of voters approved of the new constitution. As a result, Spain successfully transitioned from a one-party personalist dictatorship to a multiparty parliamentary democracy composed of 17 autonomous communities and two autonomous cities. These regions enjoy varying degrees of autonomy thanks to the Spanish Constitution, which nevertheless explicitly states the indivisible unity of the Spanish nation.

=== Governance ===
====The Crown====

The Spanish Constitution provides for a separation of powers between five branches of government, which it refers to as &quot;basic State institutions&quot;. Foremost amongst these institutions is the Crown (&quot;La Corona&quot;), the symbol of the Spanish state and its permanence. Spain&#x27;s &quot;parliamentary monarchy&quot; is a constitutional one whereby the reigning king or queen is the living embodiment of the Crown and thus head of state. Unlike in some other constitutional monarchies however, namely the likes of Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, or indeed the United Kingdom, the monarch is not the fount of national sovereignty or even the &quot;nominal&quot; chief executive. Rather, the Crown, as an institution, &quot;...arbitrates and moderates the regular functioning of the institutions...&quot; of the Spanish state. As such, the monarch resolves disputes between the disparate branches, mediates constitutional crises, and prevents abuses of power.

In these respects, the Crown constitutes a fifth moderating branch that does not make public policy or administer public services, functions which rightfully rest with Spain&#x27;s duly elected legislatures and governments at both the national and regional level. Instead, the Crown personifies the democratic Spanish state, sanctions legitimate authority, ensures the legality of means, and guarantees the execution of the public will. Put another way, the monarch fosters national unity at home, represents Spaniards abroad (especially with regard to nations of their historical community), facilitates the orderly operation and continuity of the Spanish government, defends representative democracy, and upholds the rule of law. In other words, the Crown is the guardian of the Spanish constitution and of the rights and freedoms of all Spaniards. This stabilising role is in keeping with the monarch&#x27;s solemn oath upon accession &quot;...to faithfully carry out [my] duties, to obey the Constitution and the laws and ensure that they are obeyed, and to respect the rights of citizens and the Self-governing Communities.&quot;

A number of constitutional powers, duties, rights, responsibilities, and functions are assigned to the monarch in his or her capacity as head of state. However, the Crown enjoys inviolability in the performance of these prerogatives and cannot be prosecuted in the very courts which administer justice in its name. For this reason, every official act done by the monarch requires the countersignature of the prime minister or, when appropriate, the president of the Congress of Deputies to have the force of law. The countersigning procedure or &quot;refrendo&quot; in turn transfers political and legal liability for the royal prerogative to the attesting parties. This provision does not apply to the Royal Household, over which the monarch enjoys absolute control and supervision, or to membership in the Order of the Golden Fleece, which is a dynastic order in the personal gift of the House of Bourbon-Anjou.

The royal prerogatives may be classified by whether they are ministerial functions or reserve powers. Ministerial functions are those royal prerogatives that are, pursuant to the convention established by Juan Carlos I, performed by the monarch after soliciting the advice of the Government, the Congress of Deputies, the Senate, the General Council of the Judiciary, or the Constitutional Tribunal, as the case may be. On the other hand, the reserve powers of the Crown are those royal prerogatives which are exercised in the monarch&#x27;s personal discretion. Most of the Crown&#x27;s royal prerogatives are ministerial in practice, meaning the monarch has no discretion in their execution and primarily performs them as a matter of state ceremonial. Nevertheless, when performing said ministerial functions, the monarch has the right to be consulted before acting on advice, the right to encourage a particular course of policy or action, and the right to warn the responsible constitutional authorities against the same. Those ministerial functions are as follows:
#Sanction and promulgate bills duly passed by the Cortes Generales, making them laws. The Spanish Constitution mandates the monarch grant royal assent to each bill within fifteen days of its passage; he or she does not have a right to veto legislation.
#Summon the Cortes Generales into session following a general election, dissolve the same upon the expiration of its four-year term, and proclaim the election of the next Cortes. These functions are performed in accordance with the strictures of the Spanish Constitution.
#Appoint and dismiss ministers of state on the advice of the prime minister.
#Appoint the president of the Supreme Court on the advice of the General Council of the Judiciary.
#Appoint the president of the Constitutional Tribunal from among its members, on the advice of the full bench, for a term of three years.
#Appoint the Fiscal General, who leads the Prosecution Ministry, on the advice of the Government. Before tendering advice, the Government is required to consult the General Council of the Judiciary.
#Appoint the presidents of the autonomous communities as elected by their respective parliaments.
#Issue decrees approved in the Council of Ministers, confer civil service and military appointments, and award honours and distinctions in the gift of the state. These functions are performed on the advice of the prime minister or another minister designated thereby.
#Exercise supreme command and control over the Armed Forces, on the advice of the prime minister.
#Declare war and make peace on the advice of the prime minister and with the prior authorization of the Cortes Generales.
#Ratify treaties, on the advice of the prime minister.
#Accredit Spanish ambassadors and ministers to foreign states and receive the credentials of foreign diplomats to Spain, on the advice of the prime minister.
#Exercise the right of clemency, but without the authority to grant general pardons, on the advice of the prime minister.
#Patronise the Royal Academies.

The aforesaid limitations do not apply to the exercise of the Crown&#x27;s reserve powers, which may be invoked by the monarch when necessary to maintain the continuity and stability of state institutions. For example, the monarch has the right to be kept informed on affairs of state through regular audiences with the Government. For this purpose, the monarch may preside at any time over meetings of the Council of Ministers, but only when requested by the prime minister. Moreover, the monarch may prematurely dissolve the Congress of Deputies, the Senate, or both houses of the Cortes in their entirety before the expiration of their four-year term and, in consequence thereof, concurrently call for snap elections. The monarch exercises this prerogative on the request of the prime minister, after the matter has been discussed by the Council of Ministers. The monarch may choose to accept or refuse the request. The monarch may also order national referendums on the request of the prime minister, but only with the prior authorisation of the Cortes Generales. Again, the monarch may choose to accept or refuse the prime minister&#x27;s request.

The Crown&#x27;s reserve powers further extend into constitutional interpretation and the administration of justice. The monarch appoints the 20 members of the General Council of the Judiciary. Of these counselors, twelve are nominated by the supreme, appellate and trial courts, four are nominated by the Congress of Deputies by a majority of three-fifths of its members, and four are nominated by the Senate with the same majority. The monarch may choose to accept or refuse any nomination. In a similar vein, the monarch appoints the twelve magistrates of the Constitutional Tribunal. Of these magistrates, four magistrates are nominated by the Congress of Deputies by a majority of three-fifths of its members, four magistrates are nominated by the Senate with the same majority, two magistrates are nominated by the Government, and two magistrates are nominated by the General Council of the Judiciary. The monarch may choose to accept or refuse any nomination.

However, it is the monarch&#x27;s reserve powers concerning Government formation that are perhaps the most frequently exercised. The monarch nominates a candidate for prime minister and, as the case may be, appoints or removes him or her from office based on the prime minister&#x27;s ability to maintain the confidence of the Congress of Deputies. If the Congress of Deputies fails to give its confidence to a new Government within two months, and is thus incapable of governing as a result of parliamentary gridlock, the monarch may dissolve the Cortes Generales and call for fresh elections. The monarch makes use of these reserve powers in his own deliberative judgment after consulting the president of the Congress of Deputies.

====Cortes Generales====

Legislative authority vests in the (), a democratically elected bicameral parliament that serves as the supreme representative body of the Spanish people. Aside from the Crown, it is the only basic State institution that enjoys inviolability. It comprises the Congress of Deputies (&quot;Congreso de los Diputados&quot;), a lower house with 350 deputies, and the Senate (&quot;Senado&quot;), an upper house with 259 senators. Deputies are elected by popular vote on closed lists via proportional representation to serve four-year terms. On the other hand, 208 senators are directly elected by popular vote using a limited voting method, with the remaining 51 senators appointed by the regional legislatures to also serve four-year terms.

====Government====
Executive authority rests with the Government (&quot;Gobierno de España&quot;), which is collectively responsible to the Congress of Deputies. It consists of the prime minister, one or more deputy prime ministers, and the various ministers of state. These characters together constitute the Council of Ministers which, as Spain&#x27;s central executive authority, conducts the business of the Government and administers the civil service. The Government remains in office so long as it can maintain the confidence of the Congress of Deputies.

The prime minister, as head of government, enjoys primacy over the other ministers by virtue of his or her ability to advise the monarch as to their appointment and dismissal. Moreover, the prime minister has plenary authority conferred by the Spanish Constitution to direct and coordinate the Government&#x27;s policies and administrative actions. The Spanish monarch nominates the prime minister after consulting representatives from the different parliamentary groups and in turn formally appoints him or her to office upon a vote of investiture in the Congress of Deputies.

=== Administrative divisions ===
==== Autonomous communities ====


Spain&#x27;s autonomous communities are the first level administrative divisions of the country. They were created after the current constitution came into effect (in 1978) in recognition of the right to self-government of the &quot;&quot;nationalities&quot; and regions of Spain&quot;. The autonomous communities were to comprise adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural, and economic traits. This territorial organisation, based on devolution, is known in Spain as the &quot;State of Autonomies&quot; (&quot;Estado de las Autonomías&quot;). The basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the Statute of Autonomy. The Statutes of Autonomy establish the name of the community according to its historical and contemporary identity, the limits of its territories, the name and organisation of the institutions of government and the rights they enjoy according to the constitution. This ongoing process of devolution means that, while officially a unitary state, Spain is nevertheless one of the most decentralised countries in Europe, along with federations like Belgium, Germany, and Switzerland.

Catalonia, Galicia and the Basque Country, which identified themselves as &quot;nationalities&quot;, were granted self-government through a rapid process. Andalusia also identified itself as a nationality in its first Statute of Autonomy, even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country. Progressively, other communities in revisions to their Statutes of Autonomy have also taken that denomination in accordance with their historical and modern identities, such as the Valencian Community, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands, and Aragon.

The autonomous communities have wide legislative and executive autonomy, with their own elected parliaments and governments as well as their own dedicated public administrations. The distribution of powers may be different for every community, as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy, since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical. For instance, only two communities—the Basque Country and Navarre—have full fiscal autonomy based on ancient foral provisions. Nevertheless, each autonomous community is responsible for healthcare and education, among other public services. Beyond these competencies, the &quot;nationalities&quot;—Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, and Galicia—were also devolved more powers than the rest of the communities, among them the ability of the regional president to dissolve the parliament and call for elections at any time. In addition, the Basque Country, the Canary Islands, Catalonia, and Navarre each have autonomous police corps of their own: &quot;Ertzaintza&quot;, &quot;Policía Canaria&quot;, &quot;Mossos d&#x27;Esquadra&quot;, and &quot;Policía Foral&quot; respectively. Other communities have more limited forces or none at all, like the &quot;Policía Autónoma Andaluza&quot; in Andalusia or BESCAM in Madrid.

==== Provinces and municipalities ====
Autonomous communities are divided into provinces, which served as their territorial building blocks. In turn, provinces are divided into municipalities. The existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution, not necessarily by the Statutes of Autonomy themselves. Municipalities are granted autonomy to manage their internal affairs, and provinces are the territorial divisions designed to carry out the activities of the State.

The current provincial division structure is based—with minor changes—on the 1833 territorial division by Javier de Burgos, and in all, the Spanish territory is divided into 50 provinces. The communities of Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, the Balearic Islands, Madrid, Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that comprise a single province, which is coextensive with the community itself. In these cases, the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community.

=== Foreign relations ===


After the return of democracy following the death of Franco in 1975, Spain&#x27;s foreign policy priorities were to break out of the diplomatic isolation of the Franco years and expand diplomatic relations, enter the European Community, and define security relations with the West.

As a member of NATO since 1982, Spain has established itself as a participant in multilateral international security activities. Spain&#x27;s EU membership represents an important part of its foreign policy. Even on many international issues beyond western Europe, Spain prefers to coordinate its efforts with its EU partners through the European political co-operation mechanisms.

Spain has maintained its special relations with Hispanic America and the Philippines. Its policy emphasises the concept of an Ibero-American community, essentially the renewal of the concept of &quot;Hispanidad&quot; or &quot;Hispanismo&quot;, as it is often referred to in English, which has sought to link the Iberian Peninsula with Hispanic America through language, commerce, history and culture. It is fundamentally &quot;based on shared values and the recovery of democracy.&quot;

The country is involved in a number of territorial disputes. Spain claims Gibraltar, an Overseas Territory of the United Kingdom, in the southernmost part of the Iberian Peninsula. Another dispute surrounds the Savage Islands; Spain claims that they are rocks rather than islands, and therefore does not accept the Portuguese Exclusive Economic Zone (200 nautical miles) generated by the islands. Spain claims sovereignty over the Perejil Island, a small, uninhabited rocky islet located in the South shore of the Strait of Gibraltar; it was the subject of an armed incident between Spain and Morocco in 2002. Morocco claims the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the &quot;plazas de soberanía&quot; islets off the northern coast of Africa. Portugal does not recognise Spain&#x27;s sovereignty over the territory of Olivenza.

=== Military ===
The Spanish Armed Forces are divided into three branches: Army (&quot;Ejército de Tierra&quot;); Navy (&quot;Armada&quot;); and Air and Space Force (&quot;Ejército del Aire y del Espacio&quot;).

The armed forces of Spain are known as the Spanish Armed Forces (&quot;Fuerzas Armadas Españolas&quot;). Their commander-in-chief is the King of Spain, Felipe VI. The next military authorities in line are the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence. The fourth military authority of the State is the Chief of the Defence Staff (JEMAD). The Defence Staff (&quot;Estado Mayor de la Defensa&quot;) assists the JEMAD as auxiliary body.

The Spanish armed forces are a professional force with a strength in 2017 of 121,900 active personnel and 4,770 reserve personnel. The country also has the 77,000 strong Civil Guard which comes under the control of the Ministry of defense in times of a national emergency. The Spanish defense budget is 5.71 billion euros (US$7.2 billion) a 1% increase for 2015. The increase comes because of security concerns in the country. Military conscription was suppressed in 2001.

According to the 2024 Global Peace Index, Spain is the 23rd most peaceful country in the world.

=== Human rights ===
The Spanish Constitution of 1978 &quot;protect all Spaniards and all the peoples of Spain in the exercise of human rights, their cultures and traditions, languages and institutions&quot;.

According to Amnesty International (AI), government investigations of alleged police abuses are often lengthy and punishments were light. Violence against women was a problem, which the Government took steps to address.

Spain provides one of the highest degrees of liberty in the world for its LGBT community. Among the countries studied by Pew Research in 2013, Spain is rated first in acceptance of homosexuality, with 88% of those surveyed saying that homosexuality should be accepted.

The Cortes Generales approved the &quot;Gender Equality Act&quot; in 2007 aimed at furthering equality between genders in Spanish political and economic life. According to Inter-Parliamentary Union data as of 1 September 2018, 137 of the 350 members of the Congress were women (39.1%), while in the Senate, there were 101 women out of 266 (39.9%), placing Spain 16th on their list of countries ranked by proportion of women in the lower (or single) House. The Gender Empowerment Measure of Spain in the United Nations Human Development Report is 0.794, 12th in the world.

== Economy ==

Spain has a mixed economy that combines elements of free-market capitalism with social welfare and state intervention. It is one of 19 countries with a nominal gross domestic product (GDP) exceeding $1 trillion per year, ranking 14th largest worldwide and fourth largest both in the European Union and within the eurozone. Spain is classified as a high-income economy by the World Bank and an advanced economy by the International Monetary Fund. As of 2024, it is the fastest growing major advanced economy in the world, growing nearly four times higher than the eurozone average.

Spain began industrializing in the late 18th century, albeit more gradually and unevenly than other European countries; industry was limited mostly to Catalonia (primarily textile manufacturing) and the Basque Country (iron and steel production). Overall economic growth was slower than in most major western European countries, and Spain remained relatively underdeveloped by the early 20th century. The Spanish Civil War, followed by failed autarkic and interventionist policies that were worsened by international isolation, left the economy on the brink of collapse by the late 1950s. Technocratic reforms were enacted to avert the crisis, laying the groundwork for the Spanish economic miracle, a period of rapid growth from 1960 until 1974, during which Spain&#x27;s economy grew an average of 6.6 percent per year, exceeding every country except Japan.

Since its transition to democracy in the late 1970s, Spain has generally sought to liberalise its economy and deepen regional and international integration. It joined the European Economic Community—now the European Union—in 1986 and implemented policies and reforms that allowed for its participation in the inaugural launch of the euro in 1999. Spain&#x27;s largest trade and investment partners are within the EU and eurozone, including its four largest export markets; EU membership also coincided with a tripling of foreign direct investment from 1990 to 2000. Spain was among the countries hit hardest by the 2007–2008 global financial crisis and subsequent euro-zone debt crisis, enduring a protracted recession that persisted through 2014.

Spain has long struggled with high unemployment, which has never fallen below 8 percent since the 1980s; it stood at 10.61 percent in January 2025. Youth unemployment is particularly severe by both global and regional standards; at 24.90 percent (as of January 2025), it is the highest among EU members and well above the EU average of 14.6 percent. Perennial weak points of Spain&#x27;s economy include a large informal economy; an education system that performs poorly compared to most developed countries; and low rates of private sector investment.

Since the 1990s, which saw a wave of privatisations, several Spanish companies have reached multinational status; they maintain a strong and leading presence in Latin America—where Spain is the second largest foreign investor after the United States—but have also expanded into Asia, especially China and India. As of 2023, Spain was home to eight of the 500 largest companies in the world by annual revenue, according to the &quot;Fortune Global 500;&quot; these include Banco Santander, the 14th-largest banking institution in the world; electric utility Iberdrola, the world&#x27;s largest renewable energy operator; and , one of the largest telephone operators and mobile network providers. Twenty Spanish companies are listed in the 2023 &quot;Forbes&quot; Global 2000 ranking of the 2,000 largest public companies, reflecting diverse sectors such as construction (ACS Group), aviation (ENAIRE), pharmaceuticals (Grifols), and transportation (Ferrovial). Additionally, one of Spain&#x27;s largest private sector entities is Mondragon Corporation, the world&#x27;s largest worker-owned cooperative.

The automotive industry is one of the largest employers in the country and a major contributor to economic growth, accounting for one-tenth of gross domestic product and 18 percent of total exports (including vehicles and auto-parts). In 2023, Spain produced 2.45 million automobiles—of which over 2.1 million were exported abroad—ranking eighth in the world and second in Europe (after Germany) by total number. In total, 89 percent of vehicles and 60% of auto-parts manufactured in Spain were exported worldwide in 2023; the total external trade surplus of vehicles alone reached €18.8bn in 2023. Overall, the automotive industry supports nearly 2 million jobs, or 9 percent of the labor force.

=== Tourism ===
In 2024, Spain was the second most visited country in the world only behind France, recording 94 million tourists. The international tourist expenditure in 2024 was around 126 billion euros. The headquarters of the World Tourism Organisation are located in Madrid.

Spain&#x27;s geographic location, popular coastlines, diverse landscapes, historical legacy, vibrant culture, and excellent infrastructure have made the country&#x27;s international tourist industry among the largest in the world. Tourism in Spain is a major contributor to national economic life, with foreign and domestic tourism contributing to 12.3% of Spain&#x27;s GDP in 2023.

Castile and Leon is the Spanish leader in rural tourism linked to its environmental and architectural heritage.

=== Energy ===

In 2010 Spain became the solar power world leader when it overtook the United States with a massive power station plant called La Florida, near Alvarado, Badajoz. Spain is also Europe&#x27;s main producer of wind energy. In 2010 its wind turbines generated 16.4% of all electrical energy produced in Spain. On 9 November 2010, wind energy reached a historic peak covering 53% of mainland electricity demand and generating an amount of energy that is equivalent to that of 14 nuclear reactors. Other renewable energies used in Spain are hydroelectric, biomass and marine.

Non-renewable energy sources used in Spain are nuclear (8 operative reactors), gas, coal, and oil. Fossil fuels together generated 58% of Spain&#x27;s electricity in 2009, just below the OECD mean of 61%. Nuclear power generated another 19%, and wind and hydro about 12% each.

=== Science and technology ===
The Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) is the leading public agency dedicated to scientific research in the country. It ranked as the 5th top governmental scientific institution worldwide (and 32nd overall) in the 2018 SCImago Institutions Rankings. Spain was ranked 28th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.

Higher education institutions perform about a 60% of the basic research in the country. Likewise, the contribution of the private sector to R&amp;D expenditures is much lower than in other EU and OECD countries.

=== Transport ===
The Spanish road system is mainly centralised, with six highways connecting Madrid to the Basque Country, Catalonia, Valencia, West Andalusia, Extremadura and Galicia. Additionally, there are highways along the Atlantic (Ferrol to Vigo), Cantabrian (Oviedo to San Sebastián) and Mediterranean (Girona to Cádiz) coasts. Spain aims to put one million electric cars on the road by 2014 as part of the government&#x27;s plan to save energy and boost energy efficiency. The former Minister of Industry Miguel Sebastián said that &quot;the electric vehicle is the future and the engine of an industrial revolution.&quot;

, the Spanish high-speed rail network is the longest HSR network in Europe with and the second longest in the world, after China&#x27;s. It is linking Málaga, Seville, Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Valladolid, with the trains operated at commercial speeds up to . On average, the Spanish high-speed train is the fastest one in the world, followed by the Japanese bullet train and the French TGV. Regarding punctuality, it is second in the world (98.5% on-time arrival) after the Japanese Shinkansen (99%).

There are 47 public airports in Spain. The busiest one is the airport of Madrid (Barajas), with 60 million passengers in 2023, being the world&#x27;s 15th busiest airport, as well as the European Union&#x27;s third busiest. The airport of Barcelona (El Prat) is also important, with 50 million passengers in 2023, being the world&#x27;s 30th-busiest airport. Other main airports are located in Majorca, Málaga, Las Palmas (Gran Canaria), and Alicante.

== Demographics ==


In 2025, Spain had a population of 49,077,984 people as recorded by Spain&#x27;s &quot;Instituto Nacional de Estadística&quot;. Spain&#x27;s population density, at 97/km2 (251.2/sq mi), is lower than that of most Western European countries and its distribution across the country is very unequal. With the exception of the region surrounding the capital, Madrid, the most populated areas lie around the coast. The population of Spain has risen times since 1900, when it stood at 18.6 million, principally due to the spectacular demographic boom in the 1960s and early 1970s.

In 2023, the average total fertility rate (TFR) across Spain was 1.12 children born per woman, one of the lowest in the world, below the replacement rate of 2.1, it remains considerably below the high of 5.11 children born per woman in 1865. Spain subsequently has one of the oldest populations in the world, with the average age of 43.1 years.

Native Spaniards make up 86.1% of the total population of Spain. After the birth rate plunged in the 1980s and Spain&#x27;s population growth rate dropped, the population again trended upward initially upon the return of many Spaniards who had emigrated to other European countries during the 1970s, and more recently, fuelled by large numbers of immigrants who make up 12% of the population. The immigrants originate mainly in Latin America (39%), North Africa (16%), Eastern Europe (15%), and Sub-Saharan Africa (4%).

In 2008, Spain granted citizenship to 84,170 persons, mostly to people from Ecuador, Colombia and Morocco. Spain has a number of descendants of populations from former colonies, especially Latin America and North Africa. Smaller numbers of immigrants from several Sub-Saharan countries have recently been settling in Spain. There are also sizeable numbers of Asian immigrants, most of whom are of Middle Eastern, South Asian and Chinese origin. The single largest group of immigrants are European; represented by large numbers of Romanians, Britons, Germans, French and others.

=== Urbanisation ===

=== Immigration ===

According to the official Spanish statistics (INE) there were 6.8 million foreign residents in Spain in 2025 (13.9%) while all citizens born outside of Spain were 9.3 million in 2025, 19.11% of the total population.

According to residence permit data for 2011, more than 860,000 were Romanian, about 770,000 were Moroccan, approximately 390,000 were British, and 360,000 were Ecuadorian. Other sizeable foreign communities are Colombian, Bolivian, German, Italian, Bulgarian, and Chinese. There are more than 200,000 migrants from Sub-Saharan Africa living in Spain, principally Senegaleses and Nigerians. Since 2000, Spain has experienced high population growth as a result of immigration flows, despite a birth rate that is only half the replacement level. This sudden and ongoing inflow of immigrants, particularly those arriving illegally by sea, has caused noticeable social tension.

Within the EU, Spain had the 2nd highest immigration rate in percentage terms after Cyprus, but by a great margin, the highest in absolute numbers, up to 2008. The number of immigrants in Spain had grown up from 500,000 people in 1996 to 5.2 million in 2008 out of a total population of 46 million. In 2005 alone, a regularisation programme increased the legal immigrant population by 700,000 people. There are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration, including Spain&#x27;s cultural ties with Latin America, its geographical position, the porosity of its borders, the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors, which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce.

Another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of EU origin typically retiring to Spain&#x27;s Mediterranean coast. In fact, Spain was Europe&#x27;s largest absorber of migrants from 2002 to 2007, with its immigrant population more than doubling as 2.5 million people arrived. In 2008, prior to the onset of the economic crisis, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that Spain was the most favoured destination for Western Europeans considering a move from their own country and seeking jobs elsewhere in the EU.

In 2008, the government instituted a &quot;Plan of Voluntary Return&quot; which encouraged unemployed immigrants from outside the EU to return to their home countries and receive several incentives, including the right to keep their unemployment benefits and transfer whatever they contributed to the Spanish Social Security. The programme had little effect. Although the programme failed to, the sharp and prolonged economic crisis from 2010 to 2011, resulted in tens of thousands of immigrants leaving the country due to lack of jobs. In 2011 alone, more than half a million people left Spain. For the first time in decades the net migration rate was expected to be negative, and nine out of 10 emigrants were foreigners.

=== Languages ===

Spain is a multilingual state. Spanish—featured in the 1978 Spanish Constitution as &quot;castellano&quot; (&#x27;Castilian&#x27;)—has effectively been the official language of the entire country since 1931. As allowed in the third article of the Constitution, the other &#x27;Spanish languages&#x27; can also become official in their respective autonomous communities. The territoriality created by the form of co-officiality codified in the 1978 Constitution creates an asymmetry, in which Spanish speakers&#x27; rights apply to the entire territory whereas vis-à-vis the rest of co-official languages, their speakers&#x27; rights only apply in their territories.

Besides Spanish, other territorialised languages include Aragonese, Aranese, Astur-Leonese, Basque, Ceutan Arabic (Darija), Catalan, Galician, Portuguese, Valencian and Tamazight, to which the Romani Caló and the sign languages may add up. The number of speakers varies widely and their legal recognition is uneven, with some of the most vulnerable languages lacking any sort of effective protection. Those enjoying recognition as official language in some autonomous communities include Catalan/Valencian (in Catalonia and the Balearic Islands officially named as Catalan and in the Valencian Community officially named as Valencian); Galician (in Galicia); Basque (in the Basque Country and part of Navarre); and Aranese in Catalonia.

Spanish is natively spoken by 74%, Catalan/Valencian by 17%, Galician by 7% and Basque by 2% of the Spanish population.

Some of the most spoken foreign languages used by the immigrant communities include Moroccan Arabic, Romanian and English.

=== Education ===
State education in Spain is free and compulsory from the age of six to sixteen. The current education system is regulated by the 2006 educational law, LOE (&quot;Ley Orgánica de Educación&quot;), or Fundamental Law for the Education. In 2014, the LOE was partially modified by the newer and controversial LOMCE law (&quot;Ley Orgánica para la Mejora de la Calidad Educativa&quot;), or Fundamental Law for the Improvement of the Education System, commonly called &quot;Ley Wert&quot; (Wert Law). Since 1970 to 2014, Spain has had seven different educational laws (LGE, LOECE, LODE, LOGSE, LOPEG, LOE and LOMCE).

The levels of education are preschool education, primary education, secondary education and post-16 education. In regards to the professional development education or the vocational education, there are three levels besides the university degrees: the &quot;Formación Profesional Básica&quot; (basic vocational education); the &quot;Ciclo Formativo de Grado Medio&quot; or &quot;CFGM&quot; (medium level vocation education) which can be studied after studying the secondary education, and the &quot;Ciclo Formativo de Grado Superior&quot; or &quot;CFGS&quot; (higher level vocational education), which can be studied after studying the post-16 education level.

The Programme for International Student Assessment coordinated by the OECD currently ranks the overall knowledge and skills of Spanish 15-year-olds as significantly below the OECD average of 493 in reading literacy, mathematics, and science.

=== Health ===
The health care system of Spain (Spanish National Health System) is considered one of the best in the world, in 7th position in the ranking elaborated by the World Health Organisation. The health care is public, universal and free for any legal citizen of Spain. The total health spending is 9.4% of the GDP, slightly above the average of 9.3% of the OECD.

=== Religion ===
Roman Catholicism, which has a long history in Spain, remains the dominant religion. Although it no longer has official status by law, in all public schools in Spain students have to choose either a religion or ethics class. Catholicism is the religion most commonly taught, although the teaching of Islam, Judaism, and evangelical Christianity is also recognised in law. According to a 2020 study by the Spanish Centre for Sociological Research, about 61% of Spaniards self-identify as Catholics, 3% other faiths, and about 35% identify with no religion. Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services. Recent polls and surveys suggest that around 30% of the Spanish population is irreligious.

The Spanish constitution enshrines secularism in governance, as well as freedom of religion or belief for all, saying that no religion should have a &quot;state character&quot;, while allowing for the state to &quot;cooperate&quot; with religious groups.

Protestant churches have about 1,200,000 members. There are about 105,000 Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has approximately 46,000 adherents in 133 congregations.

A study made by the Union of Islamic Communities of Spain demonstrated that there were more than 2,100,000 inhabitants of Muslim background living in Spain , accounting for 4–5% of the total population of Spain. The vast majority was composed of immigrants and descendants originating from the Maghreb (especially Morocco) and other African countries. More than 879,000 (42%) of them had Spanish nationality.

Judaism was practically non-existent in Spain from the 1492 expulsion until the 19th century, when Jews were again permitted to enter the country. Currently there are around 62,000 Jews in Spain, or 0.14% of the total population.

== Culture ==

Spain is a Western country and one of the major Latin countries of Europe, and has been noted for its international cultural influence. Spanish culture is marked by strong historic ties to the Catholic Church, which played a pivotal role in the country&#x27;s formation and subsequent identity. Spanish art, architecture, cuisine, and music have been shaped by successive waves of foreign invaders, as well as by the country&#x27;s Mediterranean climate and geography. The centuries-long colonial era globalised Spanish language and culture, with Spain also absorbing the cultural and commercial products of its diverse empire.

=== World Heritage Sites ===
Spain has 50 World Heritage Sites. These include the landscape of Monte Perdido in the Pyrenees, which is shared with France, the Prehistoric Rock Art Sites of the Côa Valley and Siega Verde, which is shared with Portugal, the Heritage of Mercury, shared with Slovenia and the Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests, shared with other countries of Europe. In addition, Spain has also 14 Intangible cultural heritage, or &quot;Human treasures&quot;.

=== Literature ===
Some early examples of vernacular Romance-based literature include short snippets of Mozarabic Romance (such as refrains) sprinkled in Arabic and Hebrew texts. Other examples of early Iberian Romance include the &quot;Glosas Emilianenses&quot; written in Latin, Basque and Romance.
Early Medieval literature in Christian Iberia was written in Latin, which remained as the standard literary language up until the mid-13th century, whereas Ibero-Romance vernaculars and Basque were spoken. A decisive development ensued in the 13th century in Toledo, where Arabic scholarship was translated to the local vernacular, Castilian. In the scope of lyric poetry Castilian co-existed alongside Galician-Portuguese across the Crown of Castile up until the 16th century. The Romance variety preferred in Eastern Iberia for lyrical poetry, Occitan, became increasingly Catalanised in the 14th and 15th centuries. Major literary works from the Middle Ages include the &quot;Cantar de Mio Cid&quot;, &quot;Tirant lo Blanch&quot;, &quot;The Book of Good Love&quot; and &quot;Coplas por la muerte de su padre&quot;. Genres such as Mester de Juglaría and Mester de Clerecía were cultivated.

Promoted by the monarchs in the late Middle Ages and even codified in the late 15th century, Castilian (thought to be widespread known as &#x27;Spanish&#x27; from the 16th century on) progressively became the language of the elites in the Iberian Peninsula, which ushered in a Golden era of Castilian literature in the 16th and 17th centuries, also in the science domain, eclipsing Galician and Catalan. Famous Early Modern works include &quot;La Celestina&quot; and &quot;Lazarillo de Tormes&quot;. The famous &quot;Don Quijote de La Mancha&quot; by Miguel de Cervantes was written in this time. Other writers from the period are: Francisco de Quevedo, Lope de Vega, Calderón de la Barca or Tirso de Molina. During the Enlightenment authors included, Benito Jerónimo Feijóo, Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, and Leandro Fernández de Moratín.

Steps of Spanish Romantic literature (initially a rebellion against French classicism) have been traced back to the last quarter of the 18th century, even if the movement had its heyday between 1835 and 1850, waning thereafter. In a broader definition encompassing the period from 1868 or 1874 to 1936, the so-called Silver Age of Spanish Culture ensued.

The waning of Romantic literature was followed by the development of Spanish Realism, which offered depictions of contemporary life and society &#x27;as they were&#x27;, rather than romanticised or stylised presentations. The major realist writer was Benito Pérez Galdós. The second half of the 19th century also saw the resurgence of the literary use of local languages other than Spanish under cultural movements inspired by Romanticism such as the Catalan &quot;Renaixença&quot; or the Galician &quot;Rexurdimento&quot;. Rarely used before in a written medium, the true fostering of the literary use of the Basque language had to wait until the 1960s, even if some interest towards the language had developed in the late 19th century. 20th-century authors were classified in loose literary generations such as the Generation of &#x27;98, the Generation of &#x27;27, Generation of &#x27;36 and the Generation of &#x27;50. Premio Planeta de Novela and Miguel de Cervantes Prize are the two main awards in Spanish literature.

=== Philosophy ===

The construct pertaining a distinctive Spanish philosophical thought has been variously approached by academia, either by diachronically tracing its development throughout the centuries from the Roman conquest of Hispania on (with early representatives such as Seneca, Trajan, Lucan, or Martial); by pinpointing its origins to the late 19th century (associated to the Generation of 98); or simply by outright denying its existence. The crux around the existence of a Spanish philosophy pitted the likes of Marcelino Menéndez y Pelayo (chief architect of the myth around it) against Antonio Pérez. Foreign imports such as Krausism proved to be extremely influential in Spain in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

=== Art ===
Artists from Spain have been highly influential in the development of various European and American artistic movements. Due to historical, geographical and generational diversity, Spanish art has known a great number of influences. The Mediterranean heritage with Greco-Roman and some Moorish influences in Spain, especially in Andalusia, is still evident today. European influences include Italy, Germany and France, especially during the Renaissance, Spanish Baroque and Neoclassical periods. There are many other autochthonous styles such as the Pre-Romanesque art and architecture, Herrerian architecture or the Isabelline Gothic.

During the Golden Age painters working in Spain included El Greco, José de Ribera, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo and Francisco Zurbarán. Also in the Baroque period, Diego Velázquez created some of the most famous Spanish portraits, such as and .

Francisco Goya painted during a historical period that includes the Spanish Independence War, the fights between liberals and absolutists, and the rise of contemporary nations-states.

Joaquín Sorolla is a well-known modern impressionist painter and there are many important Spanish painters belonging to the modernism art movement, including Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, Juan Gris and Joan Miró.

=== Sculpture ===
The Plateresque style extended from beginnings of the 16th century until the last third of the century and its stylistic influence pervaded the works of all great Spanish artists of the time. Alonso Berruguete (Valladolid School) is called the &quot;Prince of Spanish sculpture&quot;. His main works were the upper stalls of the choir of the Cathedral of Toledo, the tomb of Cardinal Tavera in the same Cathedral, and the altarpiece of the Visitation in the church of Santa Úrsula in the same locality. Other notable sculptors were Bartolomé Ordóñez, Diego de Siloé, Juan de Juni and Damián Forment.

There were two Schools: the Seville School, to which Juan Martínez Montañés belonged, whose most celebrated works are the Crucifix in the Cathedral of Seville, another in Vergara, and a Saint John; and the Granada School, to which Alonso Cano belonged, to whom an Immaculate Conception and a Virgin of Rosary, are attributed.

Other notable Andalusian Baroque sculptors were Pedro de Mena, Pedro Roldán and his daughter Luisa Roldán, Juan de Mesa and Pedro Duque Cornejo. In the 20th century the most important Spanish sculptors were Julio González, Pablo Gargallo, Eduardo Chillida, and Pablo Serrano.

=== Cinema ===

After the first projection of a cinematographer in Spain by 1896, cinema developed in the following years, with Barcelona becoming the largest production hub in the country (as well as a major European hub) on the eve of the World War I. The conflict offered the Spanish industry of silent films an opportunity for further growth. Local studios for sound films were created in 1932. The government imposition of dubbing of foreign films in 1941 accustomed Spanish audiences to watching dubbed films.

Spanish cinema has achieved major international success including Oscars for films such as &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;Volver&quot;.

Distinct exploitation genres that flourished in the second half of the 20th century include the &quot;Fantaterror&quot;, the cine &quot;quinqui&quot; and the so-called films.

As of 2021, the festivals of San Sebastián and Málaga are ranked among the top cultural initiatives in the country.

=== Architecture ===
Earth and gypsum are very common materials of the traditional vernacular architecture in Spain (particularly in the East of the country, where most of the deposits of gypsum are located).
Due to its historical and geographical diversity, Spanish architecture has drawn from a host of influences. Fine examples of Islamicate architecture, belonging to the Western Islamic tradition, were built in the Middle Ages in places such as Córdoba, Seville, or Granada. Similarly to the Maghreb, stucco decoration in Al-Andalus became an architectural stylemark in the high Middle Ages.

Simultaneously, the Christian kingdoms also developed their own styles; developing a pre-Romanesque style when for a while isolated from contemporary mainstream European architectural influences during the earlier Middle Ages, they later integrated the Romanesque and Gothic streams. There was then an extraordinary flourishing of the Gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory. The so-called Mudéjar style came to designate works by Muslims, Christians and Jews in lands conquered from Muslims.

The arrival of Modernism produced much of the architecture of the 20th century. An influential style centred in Barcelona, known as modernisme, produced a number of important architects, of which Gaudí is one. The International style was led by groups like GATEPAC. Spain is currently experiencing a revolution in contemporary architecture and Spanish architects like Rafael Moneo, Santiago Calatrava, Ricardo Bofill as well as many others have gained worldwide renown.

=== Music and dance ===

Spanish music is often considered abroad to be synonymous with flamenco, a West Andalusian musical genre, which is not widespread outside that region. Various regional styles of folk music abound. Pop, rock, hip hop and heavy metal are also popular.

In the field of classical music, Spain has produced a number of noted composers such as Isaac Albéniz, Manuel de Falla and Enrique Granados and singers and performers such as Plácido Domingo, José Carreras, Montserrat Caballé, Alicia de Larrocha, Alfredo Kraus, Pablo Casals, Ricardo Viñes, José Iturbi, Pablo de Sarasate, Jordi Savall and Teresa Berganza. In Spain there are over forty professional orchestras, including the Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona, Orquesta Nacional de España and the Orquesta Sinfónica de Madrid. Major opera houses include the Teatro Real, the Gran Teatre del Liceu, Teatro Arriaga and the El Palau de les Arts Reina Sofía.

Thousands of music fans also travel to Spain each year for internationally recognised summer music festivals Sónar which features pop and techno acts, and Benicàssim which tends to feature alternative rock and dance acts. The Vitoria-Gasteiz jazz festival is one of the main ones in its genre.

The most popular traditional musical instrument, the guitar, originated in Spain. Typical of the north are the traditional bag pipers or &quot;gaiteros&quot;, mainly in Asturias and Galicia.

=== Cuisine ===
Spanish cuisine consists of a great variety of dishes which stem from differences in geography, culture and climate. It is heavily influenced by seafood available from the waters that surround the country, and reflects the country&#x27;s deep Mediterranean roots. Spain&#x27;s extensive history with many cultural influences has led to a unique cuisine. In particular, three main divisions are easily identified:

Mediterranean Spain – coastal regions, from Catalonia to Andalusia – heavy use of seafood, such as &quot;pescaíto frito&quot; (fried fish); cold soups like &quot;gazpacho&quot;; and many rice-based dishes like &quot;paella&quot; from Valencia and &quot;arròs negre&quot; (black rice) from Catalonia.

Inner Spain – Castile – hot, thick soups such as the bread and garlic-based &quot;Castilian soup&quot;, along with substantial stews such as &quot;cocido madrileño&quot;. Food is traditionally preserved by salting, such as Spanish ham, or immersed in olive oil, such as Manchego cheese.

Atlantic Spain – the Northern coast, including Asturian, Basque, Cantabrian and Galician cuisine – vegetable and fish-based stews like &quot;caldo gallego&quot; and &quot;marmitako&quot;. Also, the lightly cured &quot;lacón&quot; ham. The best known cuisine of the northern countries often rely on ocean seafood, as in the Basque-style cod, albacore or anchovy or the Galician octopus-based &quot;polbo á feira&quot; and shellfish dishes.

=== Sport ===

While varieties of football have been played in Spain as far back as Roman times, sport in Spain has been dominated by football since the early 20th century. Real Madrid CF and FC Barcelona are two of the most successful football clubs in the world. The country&#x27;s national men&#x27;s football team won the UEFA European Championship in 1964, 2008, 2012 and 2024 and the FIFA World Cup in 2010, and is the first team ever to win three back-to-back major international tournaments. Spain&#x27;s women&#x27;s national team were champions of the 2023 FIFA World Cup, becoming one of only five nations to win a Women&#x27;s World Cup. Barcelona Femení has won a record 20 domestic trophies.

Basketball, tennis, cycling, handball, futsal, motorcycling and, lately, Formula One also can boast of Spanish champions. Today, Spain is a major world sports powerhouse, especially since the 1992 Summer Olympics and Paralympics that were hosted in Barcelona, which stimulated a great deal of interest in sports in the country. The tourism industry has led to an improvement in sports infrastructure, especially for water sports, golf and skiing. In their respective regions, the traditional games of Basque pelota and Valencian pilota both are popular.

=== Public holidays and festivals ===

Public holidays celebrated in Spain include a mix of religious (Roman Catholic), national and local observances. Each municipality is allowed to declare a maximum of 14 public holidays per year; up to nine of these are chosen by the national government and at least two are chosen locally. Spain&#x27;s National Day (&quot;Fiesta Nacional de España&quot;) is celebrated on 12 October.

There are many festivals and festivities in Spain. One of the most famous is San Fermín, in Pamplona. While its most famous event is the &quot;encierro&quot;, or the running of the bulls. It has become one of the most internationally renowned fiestas in Spain, with over 1,000,000 people attending every year.

Other festivals include La Tomatina tomato festival in Buñol, Valencia, the carnivals in the Canary Islands, the Falles in Valencia or the Holy Week in Andalusia and Castile and León.

<text>Sumba (; ), natively also spelt as Humba, Hubba, Suba, or Zuba (in Sumba languages) is an Indonesian island (part of the Lesser Sunda Archipelago group) located in the Eastern Indonesia and administratively part of the East Nusa Tenggara provincial territory. Sumba has an area of , about the same size as Jamaica or Hawaii (Island). The population was 686,113 at the 2010 Census and 779,049 at the 2020 Census; the official estimate as of mid-2023 was 820,506 (comprising 420,291 males and 400,215 females). To the northwest of Sumba is Sumbawa, to the northeast, across the Sumba Strait (Selat Sumba), is Flores, to the east, across the Savu Sea, is Timor, and to the south, across part of the Indian Ocean, is Australia.

== Nomenclature ==
The name &quot;Sumba&quot; is derived from the native Sumbanese word &quot;humba&quot; or &quot;hubba&quot; (in various Subanese dialects), which means “original”, “native”, “indigenous” or “no interference”; this was initially an ethnonym referring to the native inhabitants of this island who identified themselves as &quot;tau Humba&quot; or &quot;tau Hubba&quot; ( or &#x27;original people&#x27;), to differentiate themselves from foreigners (non-Sumbanese people) who gradually and continuously came to occupy the island.

On the other hand, the Sumbanese cultural territory (including Sumba Island and its surrounding seas) are also known as &quot;tana wai humba&quot; or &quot;tana wae hubba&quot; (in Sumbanese languages), which means “our native land” or “the motherland of Sumba people”; these sentences appeared in ancient Sumbanese manuscripts that told the tale of &quot;Inya Nyale&quot; (a mermaid-like creature who used to live on land but then moved to the ocean), considered as a sacred figure in Sumbanese mythology.

The letter &#x27;h&#x27; in later time (around 12th century) replaced by &#x27;s&#x27; due to the mass migration of Javanese people from the island of Java, because the word &quot;humba&quot; sounds so similar to the Javanese word of ꦲꦸꦩ꧀ꦧꦃ (&quot;umbah&quot;, but written as &quot;humbah&quot; according to Javanese writing system), meaning &quot;to wash&quot; or &quot;to cleanse&quot;.

==History==
===Oral traditions ===
According to Sumbanese historians, Sumba Island was once connected to the neighbouring islands to the north, namely Flores and Sumbawa. 

Flores and Sumba were connected by the &quot;Kataka Lindiwatu&quot; (in Sumba languages), an ancient stone bridge built by the native of Sumba and Flores. Due to the high level of socialization around the &quot;Kataka Lindiwatu&quot; which connected both islands, civilization was thought to arise from around those regions (which nowadays correspond to northern Sumba and to part of East Sumba regency territory). This story belongs to the Sumba oral traditions as was written down by Umbu Pura Woha (2007) in his book ().

===Ancient civilization ruins===

The ruins of the historical civilization of the Sumba people dates back to the BC era; megalithic burials were found on the central regions of the island (Central Sumba) which go back to thousands of years ago. These stone-based burial traditions are still kept alive by the Sumba people and have become a &#x27;living ancient tradition&#x27; that still can be observed by scholars in modern days. The megalithic remains found on Sumba Island include dolmen tombs, upright stones, megalithic statues, stone enclosures, and levelled terraces. The Sumba megalithic tradition itself was characterized by the old megaliths built and carved with high quality standards. Some ancient tools are also found on the island. Notable findings are quadrangular adzes unearthed in the Anakalang area (a cultural region of Anakalang Sumba, a subethnic group of Sumba people).

One significant archaeological discovery was that of the urn burial site in Melolo in the 1920s, dated around 2,870 BCE.

===Javanese power===
Around the 12th century, the kingdom of Singhasari in eastern Java gained more power over the maritime Southeast Asian territory after the kingdom defeated the Mongols; since then, this kingdom evolved into the empire known as Majapahit. Sumba Island was a subject of Majapahit&#x27;s dominion, and the word &quot;Sumba&quot; itself was first officially used during the Majapahit era (mentioned in the ancient Javanese manuscripts of &quot;Pararaton&quot; and &quot;Sumpah Palapa&quot; oath of Gajah Mada); the word itself was thought as the closest substitution in Javanese for the native name of the island according to native Sumba people, which is &quot;Humba&quot; or &quot;Hubba&quot;. The Javanese people was predicted to arrived on the Sumba Island via the Madura and Kangean route, it was examined through the analysis on the DNA of chicken species on Sumba that are naturally only endemic to the eastern regions of Java and its neighbouring islands (which in these case, most probably Kangean Island).

===European colonizations===
In 1522, the native Sumba came into contact with the Europeans (Portuguese) who arrived on the island by ships to exploit the natural resources of the island. Later, it also attracted the Dutch VOC to come in the region in circa 1600s era. Historically, sandalwood was the main commodity exported to Europe from this island, thus the Sumba Island back then colloquially also known as the &quot;Sandalwood Island&quot; or &quot;Sandel Island&quot; (in English).

As the time goes by, in 1866, the island of Sumba was later transferred to and dominated by the following Dutch East Indies colonization power. The well-known Christianization of the natives of Sumba Island was started in 1886 by the Dutch under the Douwe Wielenga Jesuits missionary program in the district of Laura in West Sumba.

==Geography, climate and ecology==

The largest town on the island is the main port of Waingapu near the mouth of the Kambaniru River, with a population of 71,752 (including the adjoining district of Kambera) in mid 2023.

The landscape is low, limestone hills, rather than the steep volcanoes of many Indonesian islands. There is a dry season from May to November and a rainy season from December to April. The western side of the island is more fertile and more heavily populated than the east.

Although generally thought to be originally part of the Gondwana southern hemisphere supercontinent, recent research suggests that the island might have detached from the South East Asia margin. 
Most of it was originally covered in deciduous monsoon forest while the south-facing slopes, which remain moist during the dry season, were evergreen rainforest.
The northern part of the island is extremely arid; the soils have been depleted from deforestation and erosion.
Sumba is in the Wallacea region, having a mixture of plants and animals of Asian and Australasian origin. 
Due to its distinctive flora and fauna, Sumba has been categorised by the World Wildlife Fund as the Sumba deciduous forests ecoregion.

===Fauna===

There are a number of mammals, but the island is particularly rich in bird-life with nearly 200 birds, of which seven endemic species and a number of others are found only here and on some nearby islands. The endemic birds include the endangered Sumba eclectus parrot, four vulnerable species — the secretive Sumba boobook owl, Sumba buttonquail, red-naped fruit-dove, and Sumba hornbill — as well as three more common species: the Sumba green pigeon, Sumba flycatcher, and apricot-breasted sunbird. Saltwater crocodiles can still be found in some areas.

The Sumba hornbill or &quot;Julang Sumba&quot; (&quot;Rhyticeros everetti&quot;) is under increasing threat of extinction. Indiscriminate deforestation is threatening their survival. The population is estimated at less than 4,000 with an average density of six individuals per square kilometre. A hornbill can fly to and from over an area of up to 100 square kilometres.

===Threats and preservation===
Most of the original forest has been cleared for the planting of maize, cassava, and other crops so only small isolated patches remain. Furthermore, this clearance is ongoing due to the growing population of the island and this represents a threat to the birds.

In 1998 two national parks were designated on the island for the protection of endangered species: the Laiwangi Wanggameti National Park and Manupeu Tanah Daru National Park.

==Administration==
Sumba is part of the East Nusa Tenggara Province, and there is no single administrative body at the island level. The island and the very small offshore islands administered with it are split into four regencies (local government regions), following re-organisation on 2 January 2007 when two new regencies were created from parts of West Sumba Regency. The four regencies are Sumba Barat (West Sumba), Sumba Barat Daya (Southwest Sumba), Sumba Tengah (Central Sumba) and Sumba Timur (East Sumba), which together accounted for 14.7% of the provincial population in 2023. The regencies are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and the 2020 Census, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023. The provincial capital is not on Sumba Island, but in Kupang on West Timor.

==Culture==


The west part of Sumba is inhabited by segmentary societies made of clans and of politically autonomous villages, while Sumba North and East are occupied by stratified societies (based on castes) made of clan confederations and led by a dominant clan from which a “king” (&quot;raja&quot;) is chosen, who yields a real political power.
Thus West Sumba is more ethnically and linguistically diverse. Both systems exist simultaneously with a 3-tier class system (aristocracy, common people and slaves) assimilated in such a way that - paradoxically - it does not impair the egalitarian functioning of the Western segmentary societies. &lt;br&gt;
Villages almost always include members of several clans, because at each generation many of the youngest ones settle in villages other than the one they originated from - which may belong to an allied clan and not their own original clan and lineage.

As of 2021, Sumba is the last place on Earth where societies have remained close to the traditions of South-East Asian hill tribes and still build megalithic monuments such as dolmens for collective burials: more 100 megalithic tombs are still built each year on the island. But this too reflects the East / West difference: the Western segmentary societies built many more dolmens than the Eastern stratified societies; and dolmens in the east are larger, more richly ornated and are reserved to the royal clan. Waingapu, a Kodi village in the west of Sumba, has some 1,400 dolmens - one of the highest concentrations on the island.

The Sumbanese have a mixture of Austronesian and Melanesian ancestry. Sumba is home to 24 ethnic groups who speak nine Austronesian languages, some of these including several dialects. The largest language group is the Kambera language, spoken by a quarter of a million people in the eastern half of Sumba.

Twenty-five to thirty percent of the population practices the animist Marapu religion. The remainder are Christian, a majority being Dutch Calvinist with a substantial minority being Roman Catholic. A small number of Sunni Muslims can be found along the coastal areas. 
The younger generations seem to reject Marapu. This may be at least in part because the only functioning schools are Catholic and embracing that religion is required to attend school. Whatever the cause, the difference is significant compared to some other traditional places such as Waerebo, where the locals have a Christian first name and a traditional second name.

Sumba is famous for &quot;ikat&quot; textiles, particularly very detailed hand-woven &quot;ikat&quot;. The process of dyeing and weaving &quot;ikat&quot; is labor-intensive and one piece can take months to prepare. Ikat from West Sumba is notably different to that produced in the East: its only designs are geometric motifs and it usually includes a part that imitates a reticulated python skin.

==Development and living standards==
Sumba is one of the poorer islands of Indonesia.

===Health===
A relatively high percentage of the population suffers from malaria, although the illness is almost eradicated in the western part of the island. Infant mortality is high.

===Water===
Access to water is one of the major challenges in Sumba. During the dry season, many streams dry out and villagers depend on wells for scarce supplies of water. Villagers have to travel several kilometres several times a day to fetch water. It is mainly the women and children who are sent for water, while the men are at work. The Sumba Foundation has been active in raising sponsorship to drill wells in villages and attempting to reduce poverty on the island. As of February 2013, the Sumba Foundation was responsible for 48 wells and 191 water stations, supplying 15 schools with water and sanitation, and reducing malaria rates by some 85%.

===Electricity===
Electricity mainly comes from diesel generators. New projects include 3 MW Bayu wind power plant (PLTB) in Kadumbul, East Sumba by PT Hywind. Another is the Bodo Hula Biomass Power Plant (PLTBm), West Sumba. 1 MW capacity. Other existing renewable electricity projects involve solar PV and micro-hydroelectricity.

<text>Many Christians observe a weekly day set apart for rest and worship called a Sabbath in obedience to God&#x27;s commandment to remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.

Early Christians, at first mainly Jewish, observed the seventh-day (Saturday) Sabbath with prayer and rest. At the beginning of the second century the Church Father Ignatius of Antioch approved non-observance of the Sabbath. The now majority practice of Christians is to observe the first day of the week (Sunday), called the Lord&#x27;s Day, when many significant events occurred during the New Testament - notably the Resurrection - rather than the biblical seventh-day Sabbath as a day of rest and worship.

In line with ideas of the 16th and 17th-century Puritans, the Presbyterian and Congregationalist, as well as Methodist and Baptist Churches, enshrined first-day (Sunday) Sabbatarian views in their confessions of faith, observing the Lord&#x27;s Day as the Christian Sabbath. While practices differ among Christian denominations, common First-day Sabbatarian (Sunday Sabbatarian) practices include attending morning and evening church services on Sundays, receiving catechesis in Sunday School on the Lord&#x27;s Day, taking the Lord&#x27;s Day off from servile labour, not eating at restaurants on Sundays, not Sunday shopping, not using public transportation on the Lord&#x27;s Day, as well as not participating in sporting events that are held on Sundays; Christians who are Sunday Sabbatarians often engage in works of mercy on the Lord&#x27;s Day, such as evangelism, as well as visiting prisoners at jails and the sick at hospitals and nursing homes.

Beginning about the 17th century, a few groups of Restorationist Christians, mostly Seventh-day Sabbatarians, formed communities that practiced the keeping of the Sabbath on Saturdays.

==History==

===Sabbath timing===
The Hebrew Shabbat, the seventh day of the week, is &quot;Saturday&quot; but in the Hebrew calendar a new day begins at sunset (or, by custom, about 20 minutes earlier) and not at midnight. The Shabbat therefore coincides with what is now commonly identified as Friday sunset to Saturday night when three stars are first visible in the night sky. The Sabbath continued to be observed on the seventh day in the early Christian church. To this day, the liturgical day continues to be observed in line with the Hebrew reckoning in the church calendars in Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy. In the Latin Church, &quot;the liturgical day runs from midnight to midnight. However, the celebration of Sundays and of Solemnities begins already on the evening of the previous day&quot;.

In non-liturgical matters, the canon law of the Latin Church defines a day as beginning at midnight.

===Early Christianity===
Jewish Christians continued to observe Shabbat but met together at the end of the day, on a Saturday evening. In the gospels, the women are described as coming to the empty tomb , although it is often translated &quot;on the first day of the week&quot;. This is made clear in Acts 20:7 when Paul continued his message &quot;until midnight&quot; and a young man went to sleep and fell out of the window. Christians celebrate on Sunday because it is the day on which Jesus had risen from the dead and on which the Holy Spirit had come to the apostles. Although Christians meeting for worship on the first day of the week (Sunday for Gentiles) dates back to Acts and is historically mentioned around 115 AD, Constantine&#x27;s edict was the start of many more Christians observing only Sunday and not the Sabbath. Patristic writings attest that by the second century, it had become commonplace to celebrate the Eucharist in a corporate day of worship on the first day. A Church Father, Eusebius, who became the bishop of Caesarea Maritima about AD 314, stated that for Christians, &quot;the sabbath had been transferred to Sunday&quot;.

According to Socrates of Constantinople and Sozomen, most of the early Church (excluding Rome and Alexandria) observed the seventh day Sabbath in Easter.

===Corporate worship===
While the Lord&#x27;s Day observance of the Eucharist was established separately from the Jewish Shabbat, the centrality of the Eucharist itself made it the commonest early observance whenever Christians gathered for worship. In many places and times as late as the 4th century, they did continue to gather weekly on the Sabbath, often in addition to the Lord&#x27;s Day, celebrating the Eucharist on both days. No disapproval of Sabbath observance of the Christian festival was expressed at the early church councils that dealt with Judaizing. The Council of Laodicea (363–364), for example, mandated only that Sabbath Eucharists must be observed in the same manner as those on the first day. Neander has suggested that Sabbath Eucharists in many places were kept &quot;as a feast in commemoration of the Creation.&quot;

The issues about Hebrew practices that continued into the 2nd century tended to relate mostly to the Sabbath. Justin Martyr, who attended worship on the first day, wrote about the cessation of Hebrew Sabbath observance and stated that the Sabbath was enjoined as a temporary sign to Israel to teach it of human sinfulness, no longer needed after Christ came without sin. He rejected the need to keep a literal seventh-day Sabbath, arguing instead that &quot;the new law requires you to keep the sabbath constantly.&quot; However, Justin Martyr believe the Sabbath has only attributed to Moses and the Israelites. According to J.N Andrews, a historian, and theologian, he mentions, &quot;In his (Justin) estimation, the Sabbath was a Jewish institution, absolutely unknown to good men before the time of Moses, and of no authority whatever since the death of Christ.&quot; He identifies this through Justin&#x27;s writings: &quot;Do you see that the elements are not idle, and keep no Sabbaths? Remain as you were born. For if there was no need of circumcision before Abraham, or of the observance of Sabbaths, of feasts and sacrifices, before Moses; no more need of them is there now, after that, according to the will of God, Jesus Christ the Son of God has been born without sin, of a virgin sprung from the stock of Abraham.&quot; With more clarification, Andrews also states: &quot;Not only does he (Justin) declare that the Jews were commanded to keep the sabbath because of their wickedness, but in chapter nineteen he denies that any Sabbath existed before Moses. Thus, after naming Adam, Abel, Enoch, Lot, and Melchizedek, he says: &quot;Moreover, all those righteous men already mentioned, though they kept no Sabbaths were pleasing to God.&quot; But though he thus denies the Sabbatic institution before the time of Moses he presently makes this statement concerning the Jews: &quot;And you were commanded to keep Sabbaths, that you might retain the memorial of God. For his word makes this announcement, saying. &#x27;That ye may know that I am God who redeemed you.&#x27;&quot;[Eze.20:12.]. On these statements from Justin Martyr, J.N Andrews concludes &quot;The Sabbath is indeed the memorial of the God that made the heavens and the earth. And what an absurdity to deny that that memorial was set up when the creative work was done, and to affirm that twenty-five hundred years intervened between the work and the memorial!&quot;

===Day of rest===
A common theme in criticism Hebrew Shabbat rest was idleness, found not to be in the Christian spirit of rest. Irenaeus (late 2nd century), also citing continuous Sabbath observance, wrote that the Christian &quot;will not be commanded to leave idle one day of rest, who is constantly keeping sabbath&quot;, and Tertullian (early 3rd century) argued &quot;that we still more ought to observe a sabbath from all servile work always, and not only every seventh-day, but through all time&quot;. This early metaphorical interpretation of Sabbath applied it to the entire Christian life.

Ignatius, cautioning against &quot;Judaizing&quot; in the Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians, contrasts the Jewish Shabbat practices with the Christian life which includes the Lord&#x27;s Day:
The 2nd and 3rd centuries solidified the early church&#x27;s emphasis upon Sunday worship and its rejection of a Jewish (Mosaic Law-based) observation of the Sabbath and manner of rest. Christian practice of following Sabbath after the manner of the Hebrews declined, prompting Tertullian to note &quot;to [us] Sabbaths are strange&quot; and unobserved. Even as late as the 4th century, Judaizing was still sometimes a problem within the Church, but by this time it was repudiated strongly as heresy.

Sunday was another work day in the Roman Empire. On March 7, 321, however, Roman Emperor Constantine I issued a civil decree making Sunday a day of rest from labor, stating: 

While established only in civil law rather than religious principle, the Church welcomed the development as a means by which Christians could the more easily attend Sunday worship and observe Christian rest. At Laodicea also, the Church encouraged Christians to make use of the day for Christian rest where possible, without ascribing to it any of the regulation of Mosaic Law, and indeed anathematizing Hebrew observance on the Sabbath. The civil law and its effects made possible a pattern in Church life that has been imitated throughout the centuries in many places and cultures, wherever possible.

===From ancient times to Middle Ages===
Augustine of Hippo followed the early patristic writers in spiritualizing the meaning of the Sabbath commandment, referring it to eschatological rest rather than observance of a literal day. Such writing, however, did serve to deepen the idea of Christian rest on Sunday, and its practice increased in prominence throughout the early Middle Ages.

Thomas Aquinas taught that the Decalogue is an expression of natural law which binds all men, and therefore the Sabbath commandment is a moral requirement along with the other nine. Thus in the West, Sunday rest became more closely associated with a Christian application of the Sabbath, a development towards the idea of a &quot;Christian Sabbath&quot; rather than a Hebrew one. Sunday worship and Sunday rest combined powerfully to relate to Sabbath commandment precepts.

====Continuations of Hebrew practices====
Seventh-day Sabbath was observed at least sporadically by a minority of groups during the Middle Ages.

In the early church in Ireland, there is evidence that a sabbath-rest on Saturday may have been kept along with Mass on Sunday as the Lord&#x27;s Day. It appears that many of the canon laws in Ireland from that period were derived from parts of the laws of Moses. In Adomnan of Iona&#x27;s biography of St Columba it describes Columba&#x27;s death by having Columba say on a Saturday, &quot;Today is truly my sabbath, for it is my last day in this wearisome life, when I shall keep the Sabbath after my troublesome labours. At midnight this Sunday, as Scripture saith, &#x27;I shall go the way of my fathers&#x27;&quot; and he then dies that night. The identification of this Sabbath day as a Saturday in the narrative is clear in the context, because Columba is recorded as seeing an angel at the Mass on the previous Sunday and the narrative claims he dies in the same week, on the Sabbath day at the end of the week, during the &#x27;Lord&#x27;s night&#x27; (referring to Saturday night-Sunday morning).

An Eastern body of Christian Sabbath-keepers mentioned from the 8th century to the 12th is called Athenians (&quot;touch-not&quot;) because they abstained from uncleanness and intoxicating drinks, called Athinginians in Neander: &quot;This sect, which had its principal seat in the city of Armorion, in upper Phrygia, where many Jews resided, sprung out of a mixture of Judaism and Christianity. They united baptism with the observance of all the rites of Judaism, circumcision excepted. We may perhaps recognize a branch of the older Judaizing sects.&quot;

Cardinal Hergenrother says that they stood in intimate relation with Emperor Michael II (AD 821–829), and testifies that they observed Sabbath. As late as the 11th century Cardinal Humbert still referred to the Nazarenes as a Sabbath-keeping Christian body existing at that time. But in the 10th and 11th centuries, there was a great extension of sects from the East to the West. Neander states that the corruption of the clergy furnished a most important vantage-ground on which to attack the dominant church. The abstemious life of these Christians, the simplicity and earnestness of their preaching and teaching, had their effect. &quot;Thus we find them emerging at once in the 11th century, in countries the most diverse, and the most remote from each other, in Italy, France, and even in the Harz districts in Germany.&quot; Likewise, also, &quot;traces of Sabbath-keepers are found in the times of Gregory I, Gregory VII, and in the 12th century in Lombardy.&quot;

=== Oriental Orthodoxy ===
The Sabbath is considered holy in the Oriental Orthodox churches, both Sunday (the &quot;Christian Sabbath&quot;) and Saturday (the &quot;Old Sabbath&quot;). The Orthodox Tewahedo churches are known for celebrating the Sabbath, a practice defended in the Oriental Orthodox church in Ethiopia in the 1300s by Ewostatewos (, ) but deriving from the Apostolic Constitutions and the Canons of the Apostles, an early Christian text invoking the authority of the Apostles and practiced in the Coptic Orthodox Church much earlier. In response to colonial pressure by missionaries of the Catholic Church in the 1500s, the emperor Saint Gelawdewos wrote his &quot;Confession&quot;, an apologia of traditional beliefs and practices including observation of the Sabbath and a theological defense of the Miaphysitism of Oriental Orthodoxy. In it, he cites the Didascalia and distances the Christian observance of the seventh-day Sabbath from the Jewish observance, explicitly stating &quot;we do not honour it as the Jews do... but we so honour it that we celebrate thereon the Eucharist and have love-feasts, even as our Fathers the Apostles have taught us in the Didascalia&quot;.

===Protestant Reformation===
Protestant reformers, beginning in the 16th century, brought new interpretations of Christian law to the West. The Heidelberg Catechism of the Reformed Churches founded by John Calvin teaches that the moral law as contained in the Ten Commandments is binding for Christians and that it instructs Christians how to live in service to God in gratitude for His grace shown in redeeming mankind. Likewise, Martin Luther, in his work against the Antinomians, rejected the idea of the abolition of the Ten Commandments. They also viewed Sunday rest as a civic institution established by human authority, which provided an occasion for bodily rest and public worship. Another Protestant, John Wesley, stated &quot;This &#x27;handwriting of ordinances&#x27; our Lord did blot out, take away, and nail to His cross. But the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments, and enforced by the prophets, He did not take away. ... The moral law stands on an entirely different foundation from the ceremonial or ritual law. ... Every part of this law must remain in force upon all mankind and in all ages.&quot;

Sabbatarianism arose and spread among both the continental and English Protestants during the 17th and 18th centuries. The Puritans of England and Scotland brought a new rigorism into the observance of the Christian Lord&#x27;s Day in reaction to the customary Sunday observance of the time, which they regarded as lax. They appealed to Sabbath ordinances with the idea that only the Bible can bind men&#x27;s consciences on whether or how they will take a break from work, or to impose an obligation to meet at a particular time. Their influential reasoning spread to other denominations also, and it is primarily through their influence that &quot;Sabbath&quot; has become the colloquial equivalent of &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day&quot; or &quot;Sunday&quot;. Sunday Sabbatarianism is enshrined in its most mature expression, the &quot;Westminster Confession of Faith&quot; (1646), in the Calvinist theological tradition. Paragraphs 7 and 8 of Chapter 21 (&quot;Of Religious Worship, and the Sabbath Day&quot;) read:

The confession holds that not only is work forbidden on Sunday, but also &quot;works, words, and thoughts&quot; about &quot;worldly employments and recreations&quot;. Instead, the whole day should be taken up with &quot;public and private exercises of [one&#x27;s] worship, and in the duties of necessity and mercy&quot;.

Strict Sunday Sabbatarianism is sometimes called &quot;Puritan Sabbath&quot;, which may be contrasted with &quot;Continental Sabbath&quot;. The latter follows the reformed confessions of faith of Continental Europe such as the &quot;Heidelberg Catechism&quot;, which emphasize rest and worship on the Lord&#x27;s Day, but do not explicitly forbid recreational activities. However, in practice, many continental Reformed Christians also abstain from recreation on the Sabbath, following the admonition by the Heidelberg Catechism&#x27;s author Zacharaias Ursinus that &quot;To keep holy the Sabbath, is not to spend the day in slothfulness and idleness&quot;.

Though first-day Sabbatarian practice declined in the 18th century, the First Great Awakening in the 19th century led to a greater concern for strict Sunday observance. The founding of the Day One Christian Ministries in 1831 was influenced by the teaching of Daniel Wilson.

==Common theology==

Many Christian theologians believe that Sabbath observance is not binding for Christians today, citing for instance Colossians 2:16–17.

Some Christian non-Sabbatarians advocate physical Sabbath rest on any chosen day of the week, and some advocate Sabbath as a symbolic metaphor for rest in Christ; the concept of Lord&#x27;s Day is usually treated as synonymous with &quot;Sabbath&quot;. This non-Sabbatarian interpretation usually states that Jesus&#x27;s obedience and the New Covenant fulfilled the laws of Sabbath, the Ten Commandments, and the Law of Moses, which are thus considered not to be binding moral laws, and sometimes considered abolished or abrogated. While Sunday is often observed as the day of Christian assembly and worship, in accordance with church tradition, Sabbath commandments are dissociated from this practice.

Non-Sabbatarian Christians also cite 2 Corinthians 3:2–3, in which believers are compared to &quot;a letter from Christ, the result of our ministry, written ... not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts&quot;; this interpretation states that Christians accordingly no longer follow the Ten Commandments with dead orthodoxy (&quot;tablets of stone&quot;), but follow a new law written upon &quot;tablets of human hearts&quot;. In 3:7–11 we read that &quot;if the ministry that brought death, which was engraved in letters on stone, came with glory ..., will not the ministry of the Spirit be even more glorious? ... And if what was fading away came with glory, how much greater is the glory of that which lasts!&quot; This is interpreted as teaching that New Covenant Christians are not bound by the Mosaic Law, and that Sabbath-keeping is not required. Further, because &quot;love is the fulfillment of the law&quot;, the new-covenant &quot;law&quot; is considered to be based entirely upon love and to rescind Sabbath requirements.

Methodist theologian Joseph D. McPherson criticizes these views, and teaches that the Lord&#x27;s Day as the First-day Christian Sabbath is binding:

===Spiritual rest===
Non-Sabbatarians who affirm that Sabbath-keeping remains for God&#x27;s people frequently regard this as present weeklong spiritual rest or future heavenly rest rather than as physical weekly rest. For instance, Irenaeus saw Sabbath rest from secular affairs for one day each week as a sign of the way that Christians were called to permanently devote themselves to God, and an eschatological symbol. One such interpretation of Hebrews states that seventh-day Sabbath is no longer relevant as a regular, literal day of rest, but instead is a symbolic metaphor for the eternal salvation &quot;rest&quot; that Christians enjoy in Christ, which was in turn prefigured by the promised land of Canaan.

==Sabbatarian churches==
===Western Christianity===
Much of Western Christianity came to view Sunday as a transference of Sabbath observance to the first day, identifying Sunday with a first-day &quot;Christian Sabbath&quot;. While first-day Sabbatarian practice declined during the 18th century, leaving few modern followers, its concern for stricter Sunday observances did have influence in the West, shaping the origin of the Christian Sabbath. The term no longer applies to a specific set of practices, but tends to be used to describe the general establishment of Sunday worship and rest observances within Christianity. It does not necessarily imply the displacement of the Sabbath itself, which is often recognized as remaining on Saturday. As such, the Christian Sabbath generally represents a reinterpretation of the meaning of the Sabbath in the light of Christian law, emphases of practice, and values.

====Roman Catholicism====
In the Latin Church, Sunday is kept in commemoration of the resurrection of Jesus and celebrated with the Eucharist. The Lord&#x27;s Day is considered both the first day and the &quot;eighth day&quot; of the week, symbolizing both first creation and new creation (2174). Roman Catholics view the first day as a day for assembly for worship. In the spirit of the Sabbath, Catholics ought to observe a day of rest from servile work, which also becomes &quot;a day of protest against the servitude of work and the worship of money.&quot; This day is traditionally observed on Sunday in conjunction with the Lord&#x27;s Day.

A summation of Catholic teaching is &quot;Do what we can to observe the sabbatical rest on Sundays and Holy Days, hear Holy Mass, and take the time to rest your minds and bodies.&quot; The 1917 Code of Canon Law ¶1248 stipulated that &quot;On feast days of precept, Mass is to be heard; there is an abstinence from servile work, legal acts, and likewise, unless there is a special indult or legitimate customs provide otherwise, from public trade, shopping, and other public buying and selling.&quot; Examples of servile works forbidden under this injunction include &quot;plowing, sowing, harvesting, sewing, cobbling, tailoring, printing, masonry works&quot; and &quot;all works in mines and factories&quot;; commercial activity, such as &quot;marketing, fairs, buying and selling, public auctions, shopping in stores&quot; is prohibited as well.

Seeking to uphold the &quot;Lord&#x27;s Day Act&quot; in French Quebec, the Catholic Sunday League was formed in 1923 to promote First-day Sabbatarian restrictions in the province, especially against movie theaters.

In 1998 Pope John Paul II wrote an apostolic letter &quot;Dies Domini&quot;, &quot;on keeping the Lord&#x27;s day holy&quot;. He encouraged Catholics to remember the importance of keeping Sunday holy, urging that it not lose its meaning by being blended with a frivolous &quot;weekend&quot; mentality.

====Lutheranism====
Lutheran founder Martin Luther stated &quot;I wonder exceedingly how it came to be imputed to me that I should reject the law of Ten Commandments. ...Whosoever abrogates the law must of necessity abrogate sin also.&quot; The Lutheran Augsburg Confession, speaking of changes made by Roman Catholic pontiffs, states: &quot;They refer to the Sabbath-day as having been changed into the Lord&#x27;s Day, contrary to the Decalogue, as it seems. Neither is there any example whereof they make more than concerning the changing of the Sabbath-day. Great, say they, is the power of the Church, since it has dispensed with one of the Ten Commandments!&quot; Lutheran church historian Augustus Neander states &quot;The festival of Sunday, like all other festivals, was always only a human ordinance&quot;.

Lutheran writer Marva Dawn keeps a whole day as Sabbath, advocating for rest during any weekly complete 24-hour period and favoring rest from Saturday sunset to Sunday sunset, but regarding corporate worship as &quot;an essential part of God&#x27;s Sabbath reclamation.&quot;

===Eastern Christianity===
Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Lutheran and Eastern Catholic Churches distinguish between the Sabbath (Saturday) and the Lord&#x27;s Day (Sunday), and both continue to play a special role for the faithful. Many parishes and monasteries will serve the Divine Liturgy on both Saturday morning and Sunday morning. The church never allows strict fasting on any Saturday (except Holy Saturday) or Sunday, and the fasting rules on those Saturdays and Sundays which fall during one of the fasting seasons (such as Great Lent, Apostles&#x27; Fast, etc.) are always relaxed to some degree. During Great Lent, when the celebration of the Liturgy is forbidden on weekdays, there is always Liturgy on Saturday as well as Sunday. The church also has a special cycle of Bible readings (Epistle and Gospel) for Saturdays and Sundays which is different from the cycle of readings allotted to weekdays. However, the Lord&#x27;s Day, being a celebration of the Resurrection, is clearly given more emphasis. For instance, in the Russian Orthodox Church Sunday is always observed with an all-night vigil on Saturday night, and in all of the Eastern Churches it is amplified with special hymns which are chanted only on Sunday. If a feast day falls on a Sunday it is always combined with the hymns for Sunday (unless it is a Lord&#x27;s Great Feast). Saturday is celebrated as a sort of afterfeast for the previous Sunday, on which several of the hymns from the previous Sunday are repeated.

In part, Eastern Christians continue to celebrate Saturday as Sabbath because of its role in the history of salvation: it was on a Saturday that Jesus &quot;rested&quot; in the cave tomb after the Passion. For this reason also, Saturday is a day for general commemoration of the departed, and special requiem hymns are often chanted on this day. Orthodox Christians make time to help the poor and needy as well on this day.

====Eastern Orthodoxy====
Orthodox Sunday worship is not a direct Sabbath observance. The Eastern Orthodox Church observes the first day (liturgical Sunday, beginning Saturday evening) as a weekly feast, the remembrance of Christ&#x27;s resurrection, and a mini-Pascha. As such, it tends to hold the first place within a week&#x27;s observances, sharing that place only with other major feasts which occur from time to time. The Divine Liturgy is always celebrated, joining the participants on earth with those who offer the worship in God&#x27;s kingdom, and hence joining the first day to the eighth day, wherein the communion of the whole Church with Christ is fully realized. As such, it is never surpassed as a time for the Orthodox to assemble in worship.

The Church affirms its authority to appoint the time of this feast (and all observances) as deriving from the authority given to the apostles and passed to the bishops through the laying-on of hands, for the sake of the governance of the Church on earth, and under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. It does not treat Sunday worship as a transference of Sabbath worship, but identifies the Sabbath, still on Saturday, as a Biblical &quot;type&quot;, a precursor, realized fully only after Christ&#x27;s fulfillment of the Mosaic Law. Thus, the Sabbath and the Mosaic Law both remain as a teacher, reminding Christians to worship in holiness, but now according to grace, in Christian observations and Sunday worship.

The grace received in baptism binds the Church to Christ, who has given his people the freedom to seek him directly in relationship, not to pursue whatever suits one&#x27;s fancy. The goal of that freedom is always union with Christ in theosis, and the maintenance of that union all the time, throughout this life and into the next, which is sometimes described as the &quot;sanctification of time&quot;. Grace therefore never permits of whatever is sinful or unhelpful to salvation, such as laziness or hedonistic revelry. Rather, it becomes a stricter guide for behavior than any legal code, even the Mosaic, and disciplines the believer in some degree of ascetic endeavor.

Orthodoxy recognizes no mandated time for rest, a day or any other span, but the Church leads the individual to holiness in different ways, and recognizes the need for economy and for rest. Activities such as sleep, relaxation, and recreation become a matter of balance and proper handling, and acceptance of God&#x27;s mercy. St. Basil the Great expresses thanks for this in a prayer often said by Orthodox Christians in the morning, after rising: &quot;You do we bless, O Most High God and Lord of mercy, ... Who has given unto us sleep for rest from our infirmity, and for repose of our much-toiling flesh.&quot; In recognition of God&#x27;s gifts, therefore, the Church welcomes and supports civil laws that provide a day away from labor, which then become opportunities for Christians to pray, rest, and engage in acts of mercy. In grace do Christians respond, remembering both the example of the Sabbath rest, and Christ&#x27;s lordship.

===Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
In 1831, Joseph Smith published a revelation commanding his related movement, the formative Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints), to go to the house of prayer, offer up their sacraments, rest from their labors, and pay their devotions on the Lord&#x27;s day (D&amp;C 59:9–12). Latter Day Saints believe this means performing no labor that would keep them from giving their full attention to spiritual matters (Ex. 20:10). LDS prophets have described this as meaning they should not shop, hunt, fish, attend sports events, or participate in similar activities on that day. Elder Spencer W. Kimball wrote in his &quot;The Miracle of Forgiveness&quot; that mere idle lounging on the Sabbath does not keep the day holy, and that it calls for constructive thoughts and acts.

Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are encouraged to prepare their meals with &quot;singleness of heart&quot; on the Sabbath and believe the day is only for righteous activities (Is. 58:13). In most areas of the world, Latter-day Saints worship on Sunday.

==First-day sabbatarian churches and organizations==

The observance of the Lord&#x27;s Day (Sunday) as the Christian Sabbath is known as first-day Sabbatarianism and this view was historically heralded by nonconformist denominations, such as Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Methodists, and Baptists, as well as many Episcopalians. First-day sabbatarianism impacted popular Western Christian culture, with influences remaining to the present day, e.g. Sunday laws. 

Organizations that promote Sunday Sabbatarianism include Day One Christian Ministries (formerly known as the Lord&#x27;s Day Observance Society) in the UK. With unwavering support by mainstream Christian denominations, Sabbatarian organizations were formed, such as the American Sabbath Union (also known as the Lord&#x27;s Day Alliance) and the Sunday League of America, following the American Civil War, to preserve the importance of Sunday as the Christian Sabbath. Founded in 1888, the Lord&#x27;s Day Alliance continues to &quot;encourage all people to recognize and observe a day of Sabbath rest and to worship the risen Lord Jesus Christ, on the Lord&#x27;s Day, Sunday&quot;. The Board of Managers of the Lord&#x27;s Day Alliance is composed of clergy and laity from Christian churches, including Baptist, Catholic, Episcopalian, Friends, Lutheran, Methodist, Non-Denominationalist, Orthodox, Presbyterian, and Reformed traditions. The Woman&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union also supports Sabbatarian views and worked to reflect these in the public sphere. In Canada, the Lord&#x27;s Day Alliance (renamed the People for Sunday Association of Canada) was founded there and it lobbied successfully to pass in 1906 the Lord&#x27;s Day Act, which was not repealed until 1985. Throughout their history, Sabbatarian organizations, such as the Lord&#x27;s Day Alliance, have mounted campaigns, with support in both Canada and Britain from labour unions with the goals of preventing secular and commercial interests from hampering freedom of worship and preventing them from exploiting workers.

The founder of the Moody Bible Institute declared, &quot;Sabbath was binding in Eden, and it has been in force ever since. This fourth commandment begins with the word &#x27;remember,&#x27; showing that the Sabbath already existed when God wrote the law on the tables of stone at Sinai. How can men claim that this one commandment has been done away with when they will admit that the other nine are still binding?&quot;

=== Presbyterian, Congregationalist and Reformed Baptist ===
The Westminster Confession, historically upheld by Presbyterians, commands the belief of first-day Sabbatarian doctrine:

The Savoy Declaration, upheld by Puritan Congregationalists, as well as the Second London Baptist Confession, upheld by Reformed Baptists, advanced first-day Sabbatarian views identical to those expressed in the Westminster Confession.

=== General Baptist ===
General Baptists also advocate last-day Sabbatarian doctrine in their confessions of faith; for example, the Treatise on the Faith and Practice of the Free Will Baptists states:
=== Quaker ===
The Richmond Declaration, a confession of faith held by the Orthodox branch of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakerism), teaches with regard to the First Day of the Week:
=== Schwarzenau Brethren ===
The &quot;Church Polity&quot; of the Dunkard Brethren Church, a Conservative Anabaptist denomination in the Schwarzenau Brethren tradition, teaches that &quot;The First Day of the week is the Christian Sabbath and is to be kept as a day of rest and worship. (Matt. 28:1; Acts 20:7; John 20:1; Mark 16:2)&quot;

===United Brethren===
The Church of the United Brethren in Christ, in its membership standards codified in the Book of Discipline, teaches in its position on the Lord&#x27;s Day Observance:
These standards expect the faithful to honour the Lord&#x27;s Day by attending the morning service of worship and the evening service of worship on the Lord&#x27;s Day, in addition to not engaging in Sunday trading.

=== Methodist ===
In keeping with historic Methodism, the &quot;Discipline&quot; of the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches enshrines first-day Sabbatarianism:

Regarded as the &quot;prince of Methodist theologians&quot; William Burt Pope explained that &quot;Its [the Sabbath] original purpose to commemorate the creation and bear witness to the government of the One God was retained, but, as the new creation of mankind in Christ Jesus had more fully revealed the Triune God, the day of the Lord&#x27;s resurrection, the first day of the week, became the Christian Sabbath, or the Lord&#x27;s Day&quot;. Pope delineated that the Christian Sabbath was &quot;given by Christ Himself, the Lord also of the Sabbath&quot; as with &quot;His resurrection began a formal appointment of the First day, and with the Pentecost He finally ratified it.&quot; Methodist systematic theologian Richard Watson delineated that the observance of the Sabbath is part of the unchanging moral law, and &quot;its observance is connected throughout the prophetic age with the highest promises, its violations with the severest maledictions; it was among the Jews in our Lord&#x27;s time a day of solemn religious assembling, and was so observed by him; when changed to the first day of the week, it was the day on which the Christians assembled; it was called, by way of eminence, &#x27;the Lord&#x27;s day;&#x27; and we have inspired authority to say, that both under the Old and New Testament dispensations, it is used as an expressive type of the heavenly and eternal rest.&quot;

Methodist churches have historically observed the Lord&#x27;s Day devoutly with a morning service of worship, along with an evening service of worship.

===Holiness Pentecostalism===
Churches in the Holiness Pentecostal tradition hold to the historic Methodist views on the Lord&#x27;s Day; Holiness Pentecostal churches have a morning service of worship and an evening service of worship on the Lord&#x27;s Day. To this end, Holiness Pentecostal churches &quot;oppose the increasing commercialization and secularization of Sunday.&quot; The 1900 Book of Discipline of the Fire-Baptized Holiness Church, a Holiness Pentecostal denomination, states:
==Seventh-day sabbatarian churches==

Seventh-day Protestants regard Sabbath as a day of rest for all mankind and not Israel alone, based on Jesus&#x27;s statement, &quot;the Sabbath was made for man&quot;, and on early-church Sabbath meetings. Additionally some Seventh-day Christians would argue any commandment given to &quot;Israel&quot; ought to be observed by Christians as, through faith in the Messiah of Israel, all Christians become members of the commonwealth of Israel and partake of the covenants God made with Israel, (see Ephesians 2:11-22). Seventh-day Sabbatarianism has been ignorantly criticized as an effort to combine &quot;Old Testament&quot; laws, allegedly practiced in Judaism, with &quot;Christianity&quot;, or to revive the Judaizers of the Epistles or the Ebionites. These criticisms assume a discontinuity between obedience as prescribed in the &quot;Old Testament&quot; and &quot;Christianity&quot;, which is a concept, entirely foreign to biblical Christianity, according to the whole council of scripture.

Seventh-day Sabbatarians practice a seventh-day Sabbath observance, that is almost entirely distinct than &quot;Shabbat&quot; in Judaism. While Rabbinic Halakah requires strict adherence to a plethora of minutiae detailed throughout Talmudic and Rabbinic texts, the Sabbath observance practiced by Sabbatarian Christians focuses on honoring and observing the day in accordance with the teachings of Jesus Christ, the Lord of the Sabbath. The beginning took place in London, where the follower of preacher John Traske (1586–1636), called Hamlet Jackson, self-taught Bible student, convinced Traske of the observance of the seventh day. Many followers adhered to Sabbath observance after Traske&#x27;s writings and preaching, including his wife Dorothy Traske.

In 1650, James Ockford published in London the book &quot;The Doctrine of the Fourth Commandment, Deformed by Popery, Reformed &amp; Restored to its Primitive Purity&quot;, which was the first writings of a Baptist defending Sabbath observance. Their ideas gave rise to the Seventh Day Baptists, formed in early 17th-century in England. The establishment of the first Seventh Day Baptist Church was in 1651, is the oldest modern seventh-day Sabbath denomination. The couple Stephen and Anne Mumford were the first Seventh Day Baptists in the Americas, and with five other Baptists who kept the Sabbath, they established in 1672 the first Seventh Day Baptist Church in the Americas, located in Newport, expanding into other territories.

The Worldwide Church of God, &quot;W.C.G.,&quot; now known as Grace Communion International, &quot;G.C.I.&quot;, established by Herbert W. Armstrong in the 1930s, formerly taught strict seventh-day Sabbath observance. Since Armstrong&#x27;s death in 1986, G.C.I. no longer recognizes seventh-day Sabbath observance as a strict doctrinal requirement. United Church of God, Philadelphia Church of God, and International Church of God, denominations begun by former W.C.G. members disillusioned by W.C.G.&#x27;s abandonment of Armstrongism, continue to adhere to the seventh-day Sabbath requirement.

===Seventh-day Adventist Church===

The Seventh-day Adventist Church arose in the mid-19th century in America after Rachel Oakes, a Seventh Day Baptist, gave a tract about the Sabbath to an Adventist Millerite, who passed it on to Ellen G. White.

Fundamental Belief # 20 of the Seventh-day Adventist Church states: 

==Related terms==
By synecdoche the term &quot;Sabbath&quot; in the New Testament may also mean simply a &quot;se&#x27;nnight&quot; or seven-day week, namely, the interval between two Sabbaths. Jesus&#x27;s parable of the Pharisee and the Publican describes the Pharisee as fasting &quot;twice a week&quot; (Greek &quot;dis tou sabbatou&quot;, literally, &quot;twice of the Sabbath&quot;).

Seven annual Biblical festivals, called by the name &quot;miqra&quot; (&quot;called assembly&quot;) in Hebrew and &quot;High Sabbath&quot; in English, serve as supplemental testimonies to Sabbath. These are recorded in the books of Exodus and Deuteronomy and do not necessarily occur on the Sabbath. They are observed by Jews and a minority of Christians. Three of them occur in spring: the first and seventh days of Passover, and Pentecost. Four occur in fall, in the seventh month, and are also called &quot;Shabbaton&quot;: the Christian Feast of Trumpets; Yom Kippur, &quot;Sabbath of Sabbaths&quot;; and the first and eighth days of Tabernacles.

The year of &quot;Shmita&quot; (Hebrew שמיטה, literally, &quot;release&quot;), also called Sabbatical Year, is the seventh year of the seven-year agricultural cycle mandated by the Torah for the Land of Israel. During &quot;Shmita&quot;, the land is to be left to lie fallow. A second aspect of &quot;Shmita&quot; concerns debts and loans: when the year ends, personal debts are considered nullified and forgiven.

Jewish &quot;Shabbat&quot; is a weekly day of rest cognate to Christian Sabbath, observed from sundown on Friday until the appearance of three stars in the sky on Saturday night; it is also observed by a minority of Christians. Customarily, &quot;Shabbat&quot; is ushered in by lighting candles shortly before sunset, at halakhically calculated times that change from week to week and from place to place.

The new moon, occurring every 29 or 30 days, is an important separately sanctioned occasion in Judaism and some other faiths. It is not widely regarded as Sabbath, but some Hebrew Roots and Pentecostal churches, such as the native New Israelites of Peru and the Creation Seventh Day Adventist Church, do keep the day of the new moon as Sabbath or rest day, from evening to evening. New-moon services can last all day.

In South Africa, Christian Boers have celebrated December 16, the Day of the Vow (now called the Day of Reconciliation, as annual Sabbath (holy day of thanksgiving) since 1838, commemorating a famous Boer victory over the Zulu Kingdom.

Many early Christian writers from the 2nd century, such as pseudo-Barnabas, Irenaeus, Justin Martyr and Hippolytus of Rome followed rabbinic Judaism (the &quot;Mishna&quot;) in interpreting Sabbath not as a literal day of rest but as a thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ, which would follow six millennia of world history.

Secular use of &quot;Sabbath&quot; for &quot;rest day&quot;, while it usually refers to Sunday, is often stated in North America to refer to different purposes for the rest day than those of Christendom. In &quot;McGowan v. Maryland&quot; (1961), the Supreme Court of the United States held that contemporary Maryland blue laws (typically, Sunday rest laws) were intended to promote the secular values of &quot;health, safety, recreation, and general well-being&quot; through a common day of rest, and that this day coinciding with majority Christian Sabbath neither reduces its effectiveness for secular purposes nor prevents adherents of other religions from observing their own holy days.

<doc id="26672" wikidata="Q13414952" url="?curid=26672" title="SHA-1">
<text>In cryptography, SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a hash function which takes an input and produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value known as a message digest – typically rendered as 40 hexadecimal digits. It was designed by the United States National Security Agency, and is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard. The algorithm has been cryptographically broken but is still widely used.

Since 2005, SHA-1 has not been considered secure against well-funded opponents; as of 2010 many organizations have recommended its replacement. NIST formally deprecated use of SHA-1 in 2011 and disallowed its use for digital signatures in 2013, and declared that it should be phased out by 2030. , chosen-prefix attacks against SHA-1 are practical. As such, it is recommended to remove SHA-1 from products as soon as possible and instead use SHA-2 or SHA-3. Replacing SHA-1 is urgent where it is used for digital signatures.

All major web browser vendors ceased acceptance of SHA-1 SSL certificates in 2017. In February 2017, CWI Amsterdam and Google announced they had performed a collision attack against SHA-1, publishing two dissimilar PDF files which produced the same SHA-1 hash. However, SHA-1 is still secure for HMAC.

Microsoft has discontinued SHA-1 code signing support for Windows Update on August 3, 2020, which also effectively ended the update servers for versions of Windows that have not been updated to SHA-2, such as Windows 2000 up to Vista, as well as Windows Server versions from Windows 2000 Server to Server 2003.

==Development==
SHA-1 produces a message digest based on principles similar to those used by Ronald L. Rivest of MIT in the design of the MD2, MD4 and MD5 message digest algorithms, but generates a larger hash value (160 bits vs. 128 bits).

SHA-1 was developed as part of the U.S. Government&#x27;s Capstone project. The original specification of the algorithm was published in 1993 under the title &quot;Secure Hash Standard&quot;, FIPS PUB 180, by U.S. government standards agency NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). This version is now often named &quot;SHA-0&quot;. It was withdrawn by the NSA shortly after publication and was superseded by the revised version, published in 1995 in FIPS PUB 180-1 and commonly designated &quot;SHA-1&quot;. SHA-1 differs from SHA-0 only by a single bitwise rotation in the message schedule of its compression function. According to the NSA, this was done to correct a flaw in the original algorithm which reduced its cryptographic security, but they did not provide any further explanation. Publicly available techniques did indeed demonstrate a compromise of SHA-0, in 2004, before SHA-1 in 2017 (&quot;see §Attacks&quot;).

==Applications==

===Cryptography===

SHA-1 forms part of several widely used security applications and protocols, including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, S/MIME, and IPsec. Those applications can also use MD5; both MD5 and SHA-1 are descended from MD4.

SHA-1 and SHA-2 are the hash algorithms required by law for use in certain U.S. government applications, including use within other cryptographic algorithms and protocols, for the protection of sensitive unclassified information. FIPS PUB 180-1 also encouraged adoption and use of SHA-1 by private and commercial organizations. SHA-1 is being retired from most government uses; the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology said, &quot;Federal agencies should stop using SHA-1 for...applications that require collision resistance as soon as practical, and must use the SHA-2 family of hash functions for these applications after 2010&quot;, though that was later relaxed to allow SHA-1 to be used for verifying old digital signatures and time stamps.

A prime motivation for the publication of the Secure Hash Algorithm was the Digital Signature Standard, in which it is incorporated.

The SHA hash functions have been used for the basis of the SHACAL block ciphers.

===Data integrity===
Revision control systems such as Git, Mercurial, and Monotone use SHA-1, not for security, but to identify revisions and to ensure that the data has not changed due to accidental corruption. Linus Torvalds said about Git in 2007:
:If you have disk corruption, if you have DRAM corruption, if you have any kind of problems at all, Git will notice them. It&#x27;s not a question of &quot;if&quot;, it&#x27;s a guarantee. You can have people who try to be malicious. They won&#x27;t succeed. [...] Nobody has been able to break SHA-1, but the point is the SHA-1, as far as Git is concerned, isn&#x27;t even a security feature. It&#x27;s purely a consistency check. The security parts are elsewhere, so a lot of people assume that since Git uses SHA-1 and SHA-1 is used for cryptographically secure stuff, they think that, Okay, it&#x27;s a huge security feature. It has nothing at all to do with security, it&#x27;s just the best hash you can get. ...
:I guarantee you, if you put your data in Git, you can trust the fact that five years later, after it was converted from your hard disk to DVD to whatever new technology and you copied it along, five years later you can verify that the data you get back out is the exact same data you put in. [...]
:One of the reasons I care is for the kernel, we had a break in on one of the BitKeeper sites where people tried to corrupt the kernel source code repositories. 
However Git does not require the second preimage resistance of SHA-1 as a security feature, since it will always prefer to keep the earliest version of an object in case of collision, preventing an attacker from surreptitiously overwriting files. The known attacks (as of 2020) also do not break second preimage resistance.

==Cryptanalysis and validation==
For a hash function for which &quot;L&quot; is the number of bits in the message digest, finding a message that corresponds to a given message digest can always be done using a brute force search in approximately 2&quot;L&quot; evaluations. This is called a preimage attack and may or may not be practical depending on &quot;L&quot; and the particular computing environment. However, a &quot;collision&quot;, consisting of finding two different messages that produce the same message digest, requires on average only about evaluations using a birthday attack. Thus the strength of a hash function is usually compared to a symmetric cipher of half the message digest length. SHA-1, which has a 160-bit message digest, was originally thought to have 80-bit strength.

Some of the applications that use cryptographic hashes, like password storage, are only minimally affected by a collision attack. Constructing a password that works for a given account requires a preimage attack, as well as access to the hash of the original password, which may or may not be trivial. Reversing password encryption (e.g. to obtain a password to try against a user&#x27;s account elsewhere) is not made possible by the attacks. However, even a secure password hash can&#x27;t prevent brute-force attacks on weak passwords. &quot;See&quot; Password cracking.

In the case of document signing, an attacker could not simply fake a signature from an existing document: The attacker would have to produce a pair of documents, one innocuous and one damaging, and get the private key holder to sign the innocuous document. There are practical circumstances in which this is possible; until the end of 2008, it was possible to create forged SSL certificates using an MD5 collision.

Due to the block and iterative structure of the algorithms and the absence of additional final steps, all SHA functions (except SHA-3) are vulnerable to length-extension and partial-message collision attacks. These attacks allow an attacker to forge a message signed only by a keyed hash – , but not – by extending the message and recalculating the hash without knowing the key. A simple improvement to prevent these attacks is to hash twice: (the length of 0&quot;b&quot;, zero block, is equal to the block size of the hash function).

===SHA-0===

At CRYPTO 98, two French researchers, Florent Chabaud and Antoine Joux, presented an attack on SHA-0: collisions can be found with complexity 261, fewer than the 280 for an ideal hash function of the same size.

In 2004, Biham and Chen found near-collisions for SHA-0 – two messages that hash to nearly the same value; in this case, 142 out of the 160 bits are equal. They also found full collisions of SHA-0 reduced to 62 out of its 80 rounds.

Subsequently, on 12 August 2004, a collision for the full SHA-0 algorithm was announced by Joux, Carribault, Lemuet, and Jalby. This was done by using a generalization of the Chabaud and Joux attack. Finding the collision had complexity 251 and took about 80,000 processor-hours on a supercomputer with 256 Itanium 2 processors (equivalent to 13 days of full-time use of the computer).

On 17 August 2004, at the Rump Session of CRYPTO 2004, preliminary results were announced by Wang, Feng, Lai, and Yu, about an attack on MD5, SHA-0 and other hash functions. The complexity of their attack on SHA-0 is 240, significantly better than the attack by Joux &quot;et al.&quot;

In February 2005, an attack by Xiaoyun Wang, Yiqun Lisa Yin, and Hongbo Yu was announced which could find collisions in SHA-0 in 239 operations.

Another attack in 2008 applying the boomerang attack brought the complexity of finding collisions down to 233.6, which was estimated to take 1 hour on an average PC from the year 2008.

In light of the results for SHA-0, some experts suggested that plans for the use of SHA-1 in new cryptosystems should be reconsidered. After the CRYPTO 2004 results were published, NIST announced that they planned to phase out the use of SHA-1 by 2010 in favor of the SHA-2 variants.

===Attacks===
In early 2005, Vincent Rijmen and Elisabeth Oswald published an attack on a reduced version of SHA-1 – 53 out of 80 rounds – which finds collisions with a computational effort of fewer than 280 operations.

In February 2005, an attack by Xiaoyun Wang, Yiqun Lisa Yin, and Hongbo Yu was announced. The attacks can find collisions in the full version of SHA-1, requiring fewer than 269 operations. (A brute-force search would require 280 operations.)

The authors write: &quot;In particular, our analysis is built upon the original differential attack on SHA-0, the near collision attack on SHA-0, the multiblock collision techniques, as well as the message modification techniques used in the collision search attack on MD5. Breaking SHA-1 would not be possible without these powerful analytical techniques.&quot; The authors have presented a collision for 58-round SHA-1, found with 233 hash operations. The paper with the full attack description was published in August 2005 at the CRYPTO conference.

In an interview, Yin states that, &quot;Roughly, we exploit the following two weaknesses: One is that the file preprocessing step is not complicated enough; another is that certain math operations in the first 20 rounds have unexpected security problems.&quot;

On 17 August 2005, an improvement on the SHA-1 attack was announced on behalf of Xiaoyun Wang, Andrew Yao and Frances Yao at the CRYPTO 2005 Rump Session, lowering the complexity required for finding a collision in SHA-1 to 263. On 18 December 2007 the details of this result were explained and verified by Martin Cochran.

Christophe De Cannière and Christian Rechberger further improved the attack on SHA-1 in &quot;Finding SHA-1 Characteristics: General Results and Applications,&quot; receiving the Best Paper Award at ASIACRYPT 2006. A two-block collision for 64-round SHA-1 was presented, found using unoptimized methods with 235 compression function evaluations. Since this attack requires the equivalent of about 235 evaluations, it is considered to be a significant theoretical break. Their attack was extended further to 73 rounds (of 80) in 2010 by Grechnikov. In order to find an actual collision in the full 80 rounds of the hash function, however, tremendous amounts of computer time are required. To that end, a collision search for SHA-1 using the volunteer computing platform BOINC began August 8, 2007, organized by the Graz University of Technology. The effort was abandoned May 12, 2009 due to lack of progress.

At the Rump Session of CRYPTO 2006, Christian Rechberger and Christophe De Cannière claimed to have discovered a collision attack on SHA-1 that would allow an attacker to select at least parts of the message.

In 2008, an attack methodology by Stéphane Manuel reported hash collisions with an estimated theoretical complexity of 251 to 257 operations. However he later retracted that claim after finding that local collision paths were not actually independent, and finally quoting for the most efficient a collision vector that was already known before this work.

Cameron McDonald, Philip Hawkes and Josef Pieprzyk presented a hash collision attack with claimed complexity 252 at the Rump Session of Eurocrypt 2009. However, the accompanying paper, &quot;Differential Path for SHA-1 with complexity &quot;O&quot;(252)&quot; has been withdrawn due to the authors&#x27; discovery that their estimate was incorrect.

One attack against SHA-1 was Marc Stevens with an estimated cost of $2.77M (2012) to break a single hash value by renting CPU power from cloud servers. Stevens developed this attack in a project called HashClash, implementing a differential path attack. On 8 November 2010, he claimed he had a fully working near-collision attack against full SHA-1 working with an estimated complexity equivalent to 257.5 SHA-1 compressions. He estimated this attack could be extended to a full collision with a complexity around 261.

====The SHAppening====
On 8 October 2015, Marc Stevens, Pierre Karpman, and Thomas Peyrin published a freestart collision attack on SHA-1&#x27;s compression function that requires only 257 SHA-1 evaluations. This does not directly translate into a collision on the full SHA-1 hash function (where an attacker is &quot;not&quot; able to freely choose the initial internal state), but undermines the security claims for SHA-1. In particular, it was the first time that an attack on full SHA-1 had been &quot;demonstrated&quot;; all earlier attacks were too expensive for their authors to carry them out. The authors named this significant breakthrough in the cryptanalysis of SHA-1 &quot;The SHAppening&quot;.

The method was based on their earlier work, as well as the auxiliary paths (or boomerangs) speed-up technique from Joux and Peyrin, and using high performance/cost efficient GPU cards from Nvidia. The collision was found on a 16-node cluster with a total of 64 graphics cards. The authors estimated that a similar collision could be found by buying US$2,000 of GPU time on EC2.

The authors estimated that the cost of renting enough of EC2 CPU/GPU time to generate a full collision for SHA-1 at the time of publication was between US$75K and $120K, and noted that was well within the budget of criminal organizations, not to mention national intelligence agencies. As such, the authors recommended that SHA-1 be deprecated as quickly as possible.

==== SHAttered – first public collision ====
On 23 February 2017, the CWI (Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica) and Google announced the &quot;SHAttered&quot; attack, in which they generated two different PDF files with the same SHA-1 hash in roughly 263.1 SHA-1 evaluations. This attack is about 100,000 times faster than brute forcing a SHA-1 collision with a birthday attack, which was estimated to take 280 SHA-1 evaluations. The attack required &quot;the equivalent processing power of 6,500 years of single-CPU computations and 110 years of single-GPU computations&quot;.

==== Birthday-Near-Collision Attack – first practical chosen-prefix attack ====
On 24 April 2019 a paper by Gaëtan Leurent and Thomas Peyrin presented at Eurocrypt 2019 described an enhancement to the previously best chosen-prefix attack in Merkle–Damgård–like digest functions based on Davies–Meyer block ciphers. With these improvements, this method is capable of finding chosen-prefix collisions in approximately 268 SHA-1 evaluations. This is approximately 1 billion times faster (and now usable for many targeted attacks, thanks to the possibility of choosing a prefix, for example malicious code or faked identities in signed certificates) than the previous attack&#x27;s 277.1 evaluations (but without chosen prefix, which was impractical for most targeted attacks because the found collisions were almost random) and is fast enough to be practical for resourceful attackers, requiring approximately $100,000 of cloud processing. This method is also capable of finding chosen-prefix collisions in the MD5 function, but at a complexity of 246.3 does not surpass the prior best available method at a theoretical level (239), though potentially at a practical level (≤249). This attack has a memory requirement of 500+ GB.

On 5 January 2020 the authors published an improved attack called &quot;shambles&quot;. In this paper they demonstrate a chosen-prefix collision attack with a complexity of 263.4, that at the time of publication would cost US$45K per generated collision.

===Official validation===

Implementations of all FIPS-approved security functions can be officially validated through the CMVP program, jointly run by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the Communications Security Establishment (CSE). For informal verification, a package to generate a high number of test vectors is made available for download on the NIST site; the resulting verification, however, does not replace the formal CMVP validation, which is required by law for certain applications.

, there are over 2000 validated implementations of SHA-1, with 14 of them capable of handling messages with a length in bits not a multiple of eight (see SHS Validation List ).

==Examples and pseudocode==

===Example hashes===
These are examples of SHA-1 message digests in hexadecimal and in Base64 binary to ASCII text encoding.

* codice_1
** Outputted hexadecimal: codice_2
** Outputted Base64 binary to ASCII text encoding: codice_3

Even a small change in the message will, with overwhelming probability, result in many bits changing due to the avalanche effect. For example, changing codice_4 to codice_5 produces a hash with different values for 81 of the 160 bits:

* codice_1
** Outputted hexadecimal: codice_7
** Outputted Base64 binary to ASCII text encoding: codice_8

The hash of the zero-length string is:

* codice_9
** Outputted hexadecimal: codice_10
** Outputted Base64 binary to ASCII text encoding: codice_11

===SHA-1 pseudocode===
Pseudocode for the SHA-1 algorithm follows:
 &quot;Note 1: All variables are unsigned 32-bit quantities and wrap modulo 232 when calculating, except for&quot;
 &quot;ml, the message length, which is a 64-bit quantity, and&quot;
 &quot;hh, the message digest, which is a 160-bit quantity.&quot;
 &quot;Note 2: All constants in this pseudo code are in big endian.&quot;
 &quot;Within each word, the most significant byte is stored in the leftmost byte position&quot;
 &quot;Initialize variables:&quot;
 h0 = 0x67452301
 h1 = 0xEFCDAB89
 h2 = 0x98BADCFE
 h3 = 0x10325476
 h4 = 0xC3D2E1F0
 ml = message length in bits (always a multiple of the number of bits in a character).
 &quot;Pre-processing:&quot;
 append the bit &#x27;1&#x27; to the message e.g. by adding 0x80 if message length is a multiple of 8 bits.
 append 0 ≤ k &lt; 512 bits &#x27;0&#x27;, such that the resulting message length in &quot;bits&quot;
 is congruent to −64 ≡ 448 (mod 512)
 append ml, the original message length in bits, as a 64-bit big-endian integer. 
 Thus, the total length is a multiple of 512 bits.
 &quot;Process the message in successive 512-bit chunks:&quot;
 break message into 512-bit chunks
 for each chunk
 break chunk into sixteen 32-bit big-endian words w[i], 0 ≤ i ≤ 15
 &quot;Message schedule: extend the sixteen 32-bit words into eighty 32-bit words:&quot;
 for i from 16 to 79
 &quot;Note 3: SHA-0 differs by not having this leftrotate.&quot;
 w[i] = (w[i-3] xor w[i-8] xor w[i-14] xor w[i-16]) leftrotate 1
 &quot;Initialize hash value for this chunk:&quot;
 a = h0
 b = h1
 c = h2
 d = h3
 e = h4
 &quot;Main loop:&quot;
 for i from 0 to 79
 if 0 ≤ i ≤ 19 then
 f = (b and c) or ((not b) and d)
 k = 0x5A827999
 else if 20 ≤ i ≤ 39
 f = b xor c xor d
 k = 0x6ED9EBA1
 else if 40 ≤ i ≤ 59
 f = (b and c) or (b and d) or (c and d) 
 k = 0x8F1BBCDC
 else if 60 ≤ i ≤ 79
 f = b xor c xor d
 k = 0xCA62C1D6
 temp = (a leftrotate 5) + f + e + k + w[i]
 e = d
 d = c
 c = b leftrotate 30
 b = a
 a = temp
 &quot;Add this chunk&#x27;s hash to result so far:&quot;
 h0 = h0 + a
 h1 = h1 + b 
 h2 = h2 + c
 h3 = h3 + d
 h4 = h4 + e
 &quot;Produce the final hash value (big-endian) as a 160-bit number:&quot;
 hh = (h0 leftshift 128) or (h1 leftshift 96) or (h2 leftshift 64) or (h3 leftshift 32) or h4

The number codice_12 is the message digest, which can be written in hexadecimal (base 16).
The chosen constant values used in the algorithm were assumed to be nothing up my sleeve numbers:
* The four round constants codice_13 are 230 times the square roots of 2, 3, 5 and 10. However they were incorrectly rounded to the nearest integer instead of being rounded to the nearest odd integer, with equilibrated proportions of zero and one bits. As well, choosing the square root of 10 (which is not a prime) made it a common factor for the two other chosen square roots of primes 2 and 5, with possibly usable arithmetic properties across successive rounds, reducing the strength of the algorithm against finding collisions on some bits.
* The first four starting values for codice_14 through codice_15 are the same with the MD5 algorithm, and the fifth (for codice_16) is similar. However they were not properly verified for being resistant against inversion of the few first rounds to infer possible collisions on some bits, usable by multiblock differential attacks.

Instead of the formulation from the original FIPS PUB 180-1 shown, the following equivalent expressions may be used to compute codice_17 in the main loop above:

 &quot;Bitwise choice between &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot;, controlled by &quot;b&quot;.&quot;
 (0 ≤ i ≤ 19): f = d xor (b and (c xor d)) &quot;(alternative 1)&quot;
 (0 ≤ i ≤ 19): f = (b and c) or ((not b) and d) &quot;(alternative 2)&quot;
 (0 ≤ i ≤ 19): f = (b and c) xor ((not b) and d) &quot;(alternative 3)&quot;
 (0 ≤ i ≤ 19): f = vec_sel(d, c, b) &quot;(alternative 4)&quot;
  [premo08]
 &quot;Bitwise majority function.&quot;
 (40 ≤ i ≤ 59): f = (b and c) or (d and (b or c)) &quot;(alternative 1)&quot;
 (40 ≤ i ≤ 59): f = (b and c) or (d and (b xor c)) &quot;(alternative 2)&quot;
 (40 ≤ i ≤ 59): f = (b and c) xor (d and (b xor c)) &quot;(alternative 3)&quot;
 (40 ≤ i ≤ 59): f = (b and c) xor (b and d) xor (c and d) &quot;(alternative 4)&quot;
 (40 ≤ i ≤ 59): f = vec_sel(c, b, c xor d) &quot;(alternative 5)&quot;

It was also shown that for the rounds 32–79 the computation of:

 w[i] = (w[i-3] xor w[i-8] xor w[i-14] xor w[i-16]) leftrotate 1

can be replaced with:

 w[i] = (w[i-6] xor w[i-16] xor w[i-28] xor w[i-32]) leftrotate 2

This transformation keeps all operands 64-bit aligned and, by removing the dependency of codice_18 on codice_19, allows efficient SIMD implementation with a vector length of 4 like x86 SSE instructions.

=== Collision countermeasure ===
In the wake of SHAttered, Marc Stevens and Dan Shumow published &quot;sha1collisiondetection&quot; (SHA-1CD), a variant of SHA-1 that detects collision attacks and changes the hash output when one is detected. The false positive rate is 2−90. SHA-1CD is used by GitHub since March 2017 and git since version 2.13.0 of May 2017.

<doc id="26675" wikidata="Q228882" url="?curid=26675" title="Shannon Elizabeth">
<text>Shannon Elizabeth Fadal (born September 7, 1973) is an American actress and poker player. Her film roles solidified her status as a sex symbol of the 1990s and 2000s.

In film, Elizabeth is best known for her role as Nadia in the &quot;American Pie&quot; film series (1999–2001; 2012), which saw her have a supporting role in the first film, a lead ensemble role in the second film, and a cameo role in the fourth film. Her other notable credits include lead roles in &quot;Scary Movie&quot; (2000), &quot;Tomcats&quot; (2001), &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot; (2001), &quot;Thirteen Ghosts&quot; (2001), &quot;Cursed&quot; (2005), and &quot;Night of the Demons&quot; (2009), and supporting roles in &quot;Love Actually&quot; (2003), &quot;The Grand&quot; (2007), and &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&quot; (2019).

In television, Elizabeth had a recurring role as Brooke Rockwell on the Fox sitcom &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; (2003–2005) and a main role as Tiffany Sherwood on the UPN sitcom &quot;Cuts&quot; (2005–2006).

Elizabeth splits her time between Cape Town, South Africa, and the USA, and runs her non-profit organization, an animal rescue turned conservation organization she co-created in 2001—previously Animal Avengers. The Foundation has also launched One Woman&#x27;s Legacy, a scholarship program that helps African women break through the glass ceiling in conservation studies. She is a professional poker player, and in 2006 was named &quot;one of the leading celebrity poker players.&quot;

==Early life==
Elizabeth was born Shannon Elizabeth Fadal in Houston, Texas, to a father of Lebanese ancestry, and to a mother of German, English and Irish ancestry. She was raised in Waco, Texas, from 3rd grade through high school; Elizabeth graduated from Waco High School in 1991. In high school, she was a member of the tennis team and at one point considered a professional tennis career. Elizabeth worked as a model for Ford &amp; Elite models before she began a career in film.

==Career==

Elizabeth appeared in several films and television shows before being cast in 1999&#x27;s &quot;American Pie&quot; in the role of Nadia. It was a major box office success. Elizabeth subsequently appeared in several Hollywood films, including &quot;Scary Movie&quot;, &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back&quot;, and &quot;Tomcats&quot;. Elizabeth starred in the UPN series &quot;Cuts&quot; until the show was canceled in May 2006. Elizabeth recurred in &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot; for a number of episodes.

In 2000 and 2003, she was featured in &quot;Maxim&quot;. In June 2008 she was &quot;Maxim&quot;&#x27;s cover girl. She provided the likeness and voice for Serena St. Germaine in the 2004 video game &quot;James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing&quot;. Elizabeth was one of the celebrities on an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot; along with Tom Green, Chelsea Handler, and George Takei. Elizabeth was among the cast of the sixth season of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, partnered with Derek Hough. Elizabeth was the seventh star eliminated from the competition.In 2006, Elizabeth described poker as her second career and was called &quot;one of the leading celebrity poker players.&quot; At that time, she visited the Las Vegas Valley up to three times each month to participate in poker games with top players. Elizabeth does not appear to have been as active a poker player since scoring 12 tournament cashes from 2006 through 2010 – she has only one tournament cash (in 2013) thereafter.

Elizabeth played in the Main Event of the 2005 World Series of Poker under the guidance of Daniel Negreanu, and won a special tournament celebrating the opening of a new poker room at Caesars Palace hotel in January 2006, beating out 83 celebrities and poker professionals to win $55,000. She also cashed four times in the World Series of Poker in 2006 and 2007, but again busted out of the Main Event early. In 2007, she advanced to the semi-finals of the NBC National Heads-Up Poker Championship in a field consisting of the top poker professionals before losing to eventual champion Paul Wasicka.

Elizabeth was the host of the comedy/burlesque series &quot;Live Nude Comedy&quot; in 2009. Elizabeth also featured in Chris Brown&#x27;s &quot;Next to You&quot; music video as Brown&#x27;s girlfriend in 2011. In 2019 she reprised her role as Justice in &quot;Jay and Silent Bob Reboot.&quot;
In 2022, it was announced that Shannon Elizabeth would star in the comedy film &quot;Plan B&quot;, alongside Jon Heder, Jamie Lee and Tom Berenger.

==Personal life==
Elizabeth was married to actor Joseph D. Reitman from 2002 to 2005. She is now married to Simon Borchert. 

==Activism==
She is an environmentalist and vegan. She is a cousin of New York-based television host and relationship coach Tamsen Fadal. Animal Avengers, a non-profit animal rescue organization founded by Elizabeth and her then-husband Reitman, is dedicated to rescuing and finding a home for homeless pets, reducing pet overpopulation, promoting responsible pet guardianship and preventing animal cruelty.

Among many fundraising events, Team Bodog raised over $50,000 for Animal Avengers in a celebrity poker night on October 8, 2005. The event was hosted by tournament director Matt Savage. In 2016, she began participating in numerous other Bodog-sponsored charity events as well. The organization, based in Brazil, lead 3D printing of prosthetic body parts for animals, including a beak for goose Victoria.

Elizabeth has served as the spokesperson for Farm Sanctuary&#x27;s Adopt a Turkey program, urging people to adopt a turkey instead of eating one for Thanksgiving. She uses social media, particularly Instagram posts, to raise awareness about rhino poaching at the Poached Rhino fundraiser.

<doc id="26678" wikidata="Q462" url="?curid=26678" title="Star Wars">
<text>Star Wars is an American epic space opera media franchise created by George Lucas, which began with the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide pop culture phenomenon. The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing fictional universe. &quot;Star Wars&quot; is one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.

The original 1977 film, retroactively subtitled &quot;Episode IV: A New Hope&quot;, was followed by the sequels &quot;Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) and &quot;Episode VI: Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), forming the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. Lucas later returned to the series to write and direct a prequel trilogy, consisting of &quot;Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), &quot;Episode II: Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002), and &quot;Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005). In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise. This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of &quot;Episode VII: The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), &quot;Episode VIII: The Last Jedi&quot; (2017), and &quot;Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019).

All nine films, collectively referred to as the &quot;Skywalker Saga&quot;, were nominated for Academy Awards, with Oscars going to the first three releases. Together with the theatrical live action &quot;anthology&quot; films &quot;Rogue One&quot; (2016) and &quot;&quot; (2018), the combined box office revenue of the films equate to over  billion, making &quot;Star Wars&quot; the third-highest-grossing film franchise in cinematic history.

== Premise ==
The &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise depicts the adventures of characters &quot;a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away&quot; across multiple fictional eras, in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with droids, which may be programmed for personal assistance or battle. Space travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology. The planets range from wealthy, planet-wide cities to deserts scarcely populated by primitive tribes. Virtually any Earth biome, along with many fictional ones, has its counterpart as a &quot;Star Wars&quot; planet which, in most cases, teem with sentient and non-sentient alien life. The franchise also makes use of other astronomical objects such as asteroid fields and nebulae. Spacecraft range from small starfighters to large capital ships, such as the Star Destroyers, as well as space stations such as the moon-sized Death Stars. Telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual screens, holographic projections, and hyperspace transmission.

The universe of &quot;Star Wars&quot; is generally similar to the real universe but its laws of physics are less strict allowing for more imaginative stories. One result of that is a mystical power known as the Force which is described in the original film as &quot;an energy field created by all living things ... [that] binds the galaxy together&quot;. The field is depicted as a kind of pantheistic god. Through training and meditation, those whom &quot;the Force is strong with&quot; exhibit various superpowers (such as telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy); it is believed nothing is impossible for the Force. These superpowers are wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other: the Jedi, peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force through non-attachment and arbitration, and the Sith, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression. While Jedi Knights can be numerous, the Dark Lords of the Sith (or &#x27;Darths&#x27;) are intended to be limited to two: a master and their apprentice.

The franchise is set against a backdrop of galactic conflict involving republics and empires, such as the evil Galactic Empire. The Jedi and Sith prefer the use of a weapon called the lightsaber, a blade of plasma that can cut through virtually any surface and deflect energy bolts. The rest of the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use plasma-powered blaster firearms. In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the Hutt cartel are dominant. Bounty hunters are often employed by both gangsters and governments, while illicit activities include smuggling and slavery.

The combination of science fiction and fantasy elements makes &quot;Star Wars&quot; a very universal franchise, capable of telling stories of various genres.

== Films ==
=== The Skywalker Saga ===


The &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series centers around three sets of trilogies, the nine films of which are collectively referred to as the &quot;Skywalker Saga&quot;. The saga was produced non-chronologically, beginning &quot;in media res&quot; with the release of the original trilogy between 1977 and 1983. This was followed by the prequel trilogy, released between 1999 and 2005, and the sequel trilogy, released between 2015 and 2019.

Each trilogy focuses on a generation of the Force-sensitive Skywalker family and their struggle against the evil Sith lord Palpatine (Darth Sidious). The original trilogy depicts the heroic development of Luke Skywalker as a Jedi and his fight against Palpatine&#x27;s Galactic Empire alongside his sister, Leia. The prequels tell the tragic backstory of their father, Anakin, who is corrupted by Palpatine and becomes Darth Vader. The sequels follow the conflict between Leia&#x27;s son, Ben Solo, and Luke and Leia&#x27;s protegé, Rey, and their eventual alliance against Palpatine after the fall of the Empire.

==== Original trilogy ====

In 1971, George Lucas wanted to film an adaptation of the &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; serial, but could not obtain the rights, so he began developing his own space opera. After directing &quot;American Graffiti&quot; (1973), he wrote a two-page synopsis, which 20th Century Fox decided to invest in. By 1974, he had expanded the story into the first draft of a screenplay. Fox expected the film would be of limited financial success, and so it was given a relatively low budget, with production being moved to Elstree Studios in England to help save on cost.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; was released on May 25, 1977, and first subtitled &quot;Episode IV: A New Hope&quot; in the 1979 book &quot;The Art of Star Wars&quot;. The film&#x27;s success led Lucas to make it the basis of an elaborate film serial. With the backstory he created for the sequel, Lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy of trilogies. &quot;Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was released on May 21, 1980, also achieving wide financial and critical success. The final film in the trilogy, &quot;Episode VI: Return of the Jedi&quot;, was released on May 25, 1983.

==== Prequel trilogy ====
According to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining of the original two films. In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted, but due to the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981. In 1983, Lucas explained that &quot;There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ... As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday.&quot;

Technical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated imagery (CGI), inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas stated that the prequels would be &quot;unbelievably expensive&quot;. In 1992, he acknowledged that he had plans to create the prequel trilogy. A theatrical rerelease of the original trilogy in 1997 &quot;updated&quot; the 20-year-old films with the style of CGI envisioned for the new trilogy.

&quot;Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot; was released on May 19, 1999, &quot;Episode II: Attack of the Clones&quot; on May 16, 2002, and &quot;Episode III: Revenge of the Sith&quot; on May 19, 2005. The first two films were met with mixed reviews, with the third being received somewhat more positively. Together with the original trilogy, Lucas has referred to the first six episodic films of the franchise as &quot;the tragedy of Darth Vader&quot;.

==== Sequel trilogy ====

Prior to releasing the original 1977 film, and made possible by its success, Lucas planned &quot;three trilogies of nine films&quot;. However, he announced to &quot;Time&quot; in 1978 that he planned &quot;10 sequels&quot;. He confirmed that he had outlined the prequels and sequels in 1981. At various stages of development, the sequel trilogy was to focus on the rebuilding of the Republic, the return of Luke as a Jedi Master (a role similar to that of Obi-Wan Kenobi in the original trilogy), Luke&#x27;s sister (not yet determined to be Leia), Han, Leia, R2-D2 and C-3PO. However, after beginning work on the prequel trilogy, Lucas insisted that &quot;Star Wars&quot; was meant to be a six-part series and that there would be no sequel trilogy.

Lucas decided to leave the franchise in the hands of other filmmakers, announcing in January 2012 that he would make no more &quot;Star Wars&quot; films. That October, the Walt Disney Company agreed to buy Lucasfilm and announced that &quot;Episode VII&quot; would be released in 2015. The co-chairman of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy, became president and served as executive producer of new &quot;Star Wars&quot; feature films. Lucas provided Kennedy his story treatments for the sequels during the 2012 sale, but in 2015 it was revealed Lucas&#x27;s sequel outline had been discarded. The sequel trilogy also meant the end of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Expanded Universe stories, which were discarded from canon to give &quot;maximum creative freedom to the filmmakers and also preserve an element of surprise and discovery for the audience.&quot;

&quot;Episode VII: The Force Awakens&quot; was released on December 16, 2015, &quot;Episode VIII: The Last Jedi&quot; on December 13, 2017, and &quot;Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker&quot; on December 18, 2019, in many countries. &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; and &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; were both critical and box office successes. &quot;Episode IX&quot; received a mixed reception from critics and audiences.

=== Standalone films ===

Several &quot;Star Wars&quot; films have been produced separately from the Skywalker Saga. In 2008, Lucasfilm released the animated film &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;, which is set during the prequel trilogy and serves as the theatrical pilot of the television series of the same name. Following Disney&#x27;s acquisition of Lucasfilm in 2012, an &quot;anthology&quot; film series set between the main episodes of the Skywalker Saga entered development in parallel with the production of the sequel trilogy, described by Disney chief financial officer Jay Rasulo as origin stories.

The first film released was 2016&#x27;s &quot;Rogue One&quot;, which tells the story of the rebels who steal the plans for the Death Star, the Galactic Empire&#x27;s superweapon, just before the events of the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film. A second film, 2018&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, tells Han Solo&#x27;s backstory, set 10 years prior to &quot;A New Hope&quot;. The series &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot; was originally planned as a film, but changed to a miniseries due to &quot;Solo&quot; underperforming at the box office.

=== Upcoming films ===
In April 2023, three new &quot;Star Wars&quot; films were announced to be set within different eras of the franchise. An untitled film written and directed by James Mangold will be set during the &quot;dawn of the Jedi&quot;. Dave Filoni will direct a film set between the original and sequel trilogies during the New Republic era, serving as the climax of the various live-action television series that began with &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; in 2019. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy will direct a third film about a new Jedi Order, set fifteen years after the sequel trilogy. In January 2025, George Nolfi was hired to write the script.

In January 2024, it was announced that Jon Favreau would direct a new &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, titled &quot;The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu&quot;. In February of the same year, Bob Iger announced that the film would be the first release of the next slate of &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies. &quot;The Mandalorian &amp; Grogu&quot; is scheduled for release on May 22, 2026.

====Other potential projects====
Lucasfilm has a number of &quot;Star Wars&quot; films in various stages of development, including:

* Untitled Rian Johnson trilogy: In November 2017, a trilogy of movies written by &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; writer/director Rian Johnson was announced to be in development. In April 2023, Kennedy stated that trilogy of films is still in open development at the studio, with the writer/director working on the story, although it is not currently a priority.
* Untitled David Benioff and D. B. Weiss trilogy: In February 2018, it was announced that David Benioff and D. B. Weiss would serve as writers and producers on a trilogy of new &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies. The plot would take place chronologically before the prequel trilogy, and center around the origin of the Jedi. By May 2019, the duo were also slated to serve as co-directors of the first installment in their three films. In October of the same year however, the filmmaking duo exited development of the projects due to scheduling conflicts with projects they are developing for Netflix. Kennedy stated that the studio is open to working with the duo, and developing their films once their schedule allows it. In January 2024, the filmmaking duo announced that the working title was &quot;The First Jedi&quot; and would have followed the titular ancient protagonist. The pair cast doubt on returning to their planned trilogy, commenting on its apparent influence on James Mangold&#x27;s similarly premised &quot;Dawn of the Jedi&quot; movie.
* Untitled Taika Waititi film: In May 2020, Taika Waititi signed onto the project which was stated to be the first priority for the studio, with the filmmaker Waititi serving as director from a script he is co-writing with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. In May 2022, the movie was named as the next &quot;Star Wars&quot; film to begin production ahead of &quot;Rogue Squadron&quot;, with Kennedy stating that the studio was tentatively looking towards late 2023 for a debut, but had not yet officially set a release date. By April 2023, she stated that the project is still in development, with Waititi continuing to work on the script.
* Rogue Squadron: An anthology film, following the events of &quot;Rogue One&quot;, will be directed by Patty Jenkins with a script written by Matthew Robinson. In April 2023, Kennedy stated that the script is still in development, with the studio considering changing the project into a television series. In March 2024, Jenkins announced that she had once again commenced working on the script; confirming that developments for the project are ongoing.
* Untitled J.D. Dillard film: In February 2020, a film was announced to be in development from director J. D. Dillard and writer Matt Owens; although, Dillard announced he was no longer to direct that film in November 2022.
* Star Wars: A Droid Story: In December 2020, an animated film centered around the adventures of R2-D2 and C-3PO was announced as being in development; the story will introduce a new heroic character to the franchise, alongside the two returning droids. The project will be a joint-venture production between Lucasfilm Animation, and Industrial Light &amp; Magic. The film is being developed to debut via streaming, exclusively through Disney+.
* Untitled Shawn Levy film: In November 2022, Shawn Levy entered talks to direct a &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, following his work on &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot; (2024) and the fifth and final season of &quot;Stranger Things&quot;. In September 2023, Levy said that development on his &quot;Star Wars&quot; film began, but would not continue until after the conclusion of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike.
*Lando: In December 2020, a spin-off series to &quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot; was announced as being in development. The miniseries which was being developed exclusively for Disney+ was revealed to be centered around Landonis &quot;Lando&quot; Calrissian III, titled &quot;Lando&quot;. Donald Glover was confirmed at that time to be reprising the lead role, while Justin Simien was named as the series creator and showrunner. By July 2020 however, Donald and Stephen Glover were hired to replace Simien, write and redevelop the show. In September 2023, the show was repurposed to be released as a theatrical film instead.
* Untitled Simon Kinberg trilogy: In November 2024, Simon Kinberg was hired to write and produce the new trilogy of &quot;Star Wars&quot; movies. The series of movies was reported to be &quot;Episode X&quot;–&quot;XII&quot;, though this was also disputed by other sources.

== Television ==


===Animated series===
The first two animated series, &quot;Droids&quot; and &quot;Ewoks&quot;, were produced in the 1980s. They were followed by the &quot;Clone Wars&quot; animated micro-series in 2003 and the 2008 series of the same name. Following Disney&#x27;s acquisition of Lucasfilm, all animated series released prior to 2014, apart from the 2008 series, were discarded from the franchise&#x27;s canon. Subsequent animated series include &quot;Rebels&quot;, released in 2014; &quot;Resistance&quot;, released in 2018; and &quot;The Bad Batch&quot;, released in 2021.

Several micro-series and shorts have also been released by Lucasfilm since Disney&#x27;s acquisition, with the earlier animated series falling under Disney&#x27;s &quot;Vintage&quot; collection of &quot;Star Wars&quot; content.

===Live-action series===
The &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise includes several live-action series. The first series, &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, was released in 2019 for the streaming service Disney+ and is set between the original and sequel trilogies of the Skywalker Saga. Due to its success, the series spawned multiple live-action spin-offs set during the same fictional era, including &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;, released in 2021; &quot;Ahsoka&quot;, released in 2023; and &quot;Skeleton Crew&quot;, released in 2024. These series follow the plight of the New Republic and its allies against the remnants of the fallen Galactic Empire.

A story focused on Obi-Wan Kenobi was planned as a film before becoming a live-action series after the box office failure of &quot;&quot; in 2018. The series was released on Disney+ in 2022 and is set between the prequel and original trilogy films. It was followed by the live-action series &quot;Andor&quot; in the same year; both series follow their titular characters during the reign of the Empire.

&quot;The Acolyte&quot; is a series created by Leslye Headland set at the end of the High Republic era before the events of the Skywalker Saga, and follows an investigation into a series of murders of Jedi Masters.

=== Films and specials ===
== Fictional timeline ==


The &quot;Star Wars&quot; canon fictional universe spans multiple eras, of which three are focused around each of the film trilogies. The following eras were defined in January 2021, and further refined and expanded in April 2023:

* Dawn of the Jedi: The first Jedi wields the Force, which will be depicted in an upcoming untitled film.
* The Old Republic: The Galactic Republic is founded and the Jedi Order emerges to protect it. A schism within the Jedi leads to the creation of the Sith.

* New Jedi Order: Rey builds a new Jedi Order, which will be depicted in an upcoming untitled film.
The Expanded Universe of spin-off media depicts different levels of continuity, which were deemed non-canonical and rebranded as &quot;Legends&quot; on April 25, 2014, to make most subsequent works align to the episodic films, &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; film, and television series.

== Other media ==

From 1976 to 2014, the term &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; (EU) was an umbrella term for all officially licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; storytelling material set outside the events depicted within the theatrical films, including novels, comics, and video games. Lucasfilm maintained internal continuity between the films and television content and the EU material until April 25, 2014, when the company announced all of the EU works would cease production. Existing works would no longer be considered canon to the franchise and subsequent reprints would be rebranded under the &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; label, with downloadable content for the massively multiplayer online game &quot;The Old Republic&quot; the only &quot;Legends&quot; material to still be produced. The &quot;Star Wars&quot; canon was subsequently restructured to only include the existing six feature films, the animated film &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; (2008), and its companion animated series. All future projects and creative developments across all types of media would be overseen and coordinated by the story group, announced as a division of Lucasfilm created to maintain continuity and a cohesive vision on the storytelling of the franchise. Multiple comics series from Marvel and novels published by Del Rey were produced after the announcement. Since the new canon has been introduced, there has been a multitude of pieces of Expanded Universe continuity that have become a part of canon.

=== Print media ===
&quot;Star Wars&quot; in print predates the release of the first film, with the November 1976 novelization of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, initially subtitled &quot;From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker&quot;. Credited to Lucas, it was ghostwritten by Alan Dean Foster. The first &quot;Expanded Universe&quot; story appeared in Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Star Wars&quot; #7 in January 1978 (the first six issues being an adaptation of the film), followed by Foster&#x27;s sequel novel &quot;Splinter of the Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot; the following month.

==== Novels ====

After penning the novelization of the original film, Foster followed it with the sequel &quot;Splinter of the Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot; (1978). The novelizations of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980) by Donald F. Glut and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983) by James Kahn followed, as well as &quot;The Han Solo Adventures&quot; trilogy (1979–1980) by Brian Daley, and &quot;The Adventures of Lando Calrissian&quot; trilogy (1983) by L. Neil Smith.

Timothy Zahn&#x27;s bestselling &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy (1991–1993) reignited interest in the franchise and introduced the popular characters Grand Admiral Thrawn, Mara Jade, Talon Karrde, and Gilad Pellaeon. The first novel, &quot;Heir to the Empire&quot;, reached #1 on the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, and the series finds Luke, Leia, and Han facing off against tactical genius Thrawn, who is plotting to retake the galaxy for the Empire. In &quot;The Courtship of Princess Leia&quot; (1994) by Dave Wolverton, set immediately before the &quot;Thrawn&quot; trilogy, Leia considers an advantageous political marriage to Prince Isolder of the planet Hapes, but she and Han ultimately marry. Steve Perry&#x27;s &quot;Shadows of the Empire&quot; (1996), set between &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, was part of a multimedia campaign that included a comic book series and video game. The novel introduced the crime lord Prince Xizor, another popular character who would appear in multiple other works. Other notable series from Bantam include the &quot;Jedi Academy&quot; trilogy (1994) by Kevin J. Anderson, the 14-book &quot;Young Jedi Knights&quot; series (1995–1998) by Anderson and Rebecca Moesta, and the &quot;X-wing&quot; series (1996–2012) by Michael A. Stackpole and Aaron Allston.

Del Rey took over &quot;Star Wars&quot; book publishing in 1999, releasing what would become a 19-installment novel series called &quot;The New Jedi Order&quot; (1999–2003). Written by multiple authors, the series was set 25 to 30 years after the original films and introduced the Yuuzhan Vong, a powerful alien race attempting to invade and conquer the entire galaxy. The bestselling multi-author series &quot;Legacy of the Force&quot; (2006–2008) chronicles the crossover of Han and Leia&#x27;s son Jacen Solo to the dark side of the Force; among his evil deeds, he kills Luke&#x27;s wife Mara Jade as a sacrifice to join the Sith. Although no longer canon, the story is paralleled in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; with Han and Leia&#x27;s son Ben Solo, who becomes the evil Kylo Ren.

Three series set in the prequel era were published by Scholastic for younger audiences: the 18-book &quot;Jedi Apprentice&quot; (1999–2002) chronicles the adventures of Obi-Wan Kenobi and his master Qui-Gon Jinn in the years before &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;; the 11-book &quot;Jedi Quest&quot; (2001–2004) follows Obi-Wan and his own apprentice, Anakin Skywalker in between &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; and &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;; and the 10-book &quot;The Last of the Jedi&quot; (2005–2008), set almost immediately after &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, features Obi-Wan and the last few surviving Jedi. In 2019, a new prequel era novel, starring Qui-Gon and the young Obi-Wan, was published by Del Rey under the title &quot;Star Wars: Master and Apprentice&quot;.

Although Thrawn had been designated a &quot;Legends&quot; character in 2014, he was reintroduced into the canon in 2016 for the third season of the &quot;Rebels&quot; animated series, with Zahn returning to write more novels based on the character and set in the new canon.

==== Comics ====

Marvel Comics published a &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic book series from 1977 to 1986. Original &quot;Star Wars&quot; comics were serialized in the Marvel magazine &quot;Pizzazz&quot; between 1977 and 1979. The 1977 installments were the first original &quot;Star Wars&quot; stories not directly adapted from the films to appear in print form, as they preceded those of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic series. From 1985 to 1987, the animated children&#x27;s series &quot;Ewoks&quot; and &quot;Droids&quot; inspired comic series from Marvel&#x27;s Star Comics line. According to Marvel Comics former Editor-In-Chief Jim Shooter, the strong sales of &quot;Star Wars&quot; comics saved Marvel financially in 1977 and 1978. Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; series was one of the industry&#x27;s top selling titles in 1979 and 1980. The only downside for Marvel was that the 100,000 copy sales quota was surpassed quickly, allowing Lippincott to renegotiate the royalty arrangements from a position of strength.

In the late 1980s, Marvel dropped a new &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic it had in development, which was picked up by Dark Horse Comics and published as the popular &quot;Dark Empire&quot; series (1991–1995). Dark Horse subsequently launched dozens of series set after the original film trilogy, including &quot;Tales of the Jedi&quot; (1993–1998), &quot;X-wing Rogue Squadron&quot; (1995–1998), &quot;Star Wars: Republic&quot; (1998–2006), &quot;Star Wars Tales&quot; (1999–2005), &quot;Star Wars: Empire&quot; (2002–2006), and &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot; (2006–2010).

After Disney&#x27;s acquisition of Lucasfilm, it was announced in January 2014 that in 2015 the &quot;Star Wars&quot; comics license would return to Marvel Comics, whose parent company, Marvel Entertainment, Disney had purchased in 2009. Launched in 2015, the first three publications were titled &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Darth Vader&quot;, and the miniseries &quot;Princess Leia&quot;.

First announced as &quot;Project Luminous&quot; at Star Wars Celebration in April 2019, the &quot;Star Wars: The High Republic&quot; publishing initiative was revealed in a press conference in February 2020. Involving the majority of the then current officially licensed publishers, a new era set 200 years before the Skywalker Saga was explored in various books and comics. Including ongoing titles by Marvel and IDW Publishing, written by Cavan Scott and Daniel José Older respectively.

Marvel Comics will publish a one-shot comic book on September 4, 2024, that bridges the gap between the High Republic publishing initiative and the events of &quot;The Acolyte&quot;. Titled &quot;Star Wars: The Acolyte – Kelnacca&quot;, the one-shot was written by High Republic writer Cavan Scott with art by Marika Cresta. It focuses on Kelnacca, the Wookiee Jedi introduced in &quot;The Acolyte&quot;.

=== Audio ===
==== Soundtracks and singles ====

John Williams composed the soundtracks for the nine episodic films. He stated he would retire from the franchise with &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, but he composed a theme for Obi-Wan Kenobi for the miniseries and Han Solo&#x27;s theme for &quot;Solo: A Star Wars Story&quot;. Williams also created the main theme for &quot;Galaxy&#x27;s Edge&quot;.

Several other composers worked on other soundtracks, including John Powell (&quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot;), Michael Giacchino (&quot;Rogue One&quot;), and Ludwig Göransson (&quot;The Mandalorian&quot;).

==== Audio novels ====

The first &quot;Star Wars&quot; audio work is &quot;The Story of Star Wars&quot;, an LP using audio samples from the original film and a new narration to retell the story, released in 1977. Most later printed novels were adapted into audio novels, usually released on cassette tape and re-released on CD. As of 2019, audio-only novels have been released not directly based on printed media.

==== Radio ====

Radio adaptations of the films were also produced. Lucas, a fan of the NPR-affiliated campus radio station of his alma mater the University of Southern California, licensed the &quot;Star Wars&quot; radio rights to KUSC-FM for . The production used John Williams&#x27;s original film score, along with Ben Burtt&#x27;s sound effects.

The first was written by science-fiction author Brian Daley and directed by John Madden. It was broadcast on National Public Radio in 1981, adapting the original 1977 film into 13 episodes. Mark Hamill and Anthony Daniels reprised their film roles.

The overwhelming success, led to a 10-episode adaptation of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; debuted in 1983. Billy Dee Williams joined the other two stars, reprising his role as Lando Calrissian.

In 1983, Buena Vista Records released an original, 30-minute &quot;Star Wars&quot; audio drama titled &quot;Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell&quot;, written by Daley. In the 1990s, Time Warner Audio Publishing adapted several &quot;Star Wars&quot; series from Dark Horse Comics into audio dramas: the three-part &quot;Dark Empire&quot; saga, &quot;Tales of the Jedi&quot;, &quot;Dark Lords of the Sith&quot;, the &quot;Dark Forces&quot; trilogy, and &quot;Crimson Empire&quot; (1998). &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was adapted into 6-episodes in 1996, featuring Daniels.

=== Video games ===

The &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise has spawned over one hundred computer, video, and board games, dating back to some of the earliest home consoles. Some are based directly on the movie material, while others rely heavily on the non-canonical Expanded Universe (rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and removed from the canon in 2014). &quot;Star Wars&quot; games have gone through three significant development eras, marked by a change in leadership among the developers: the early licensed games, those developed after the creation of LucasArts, and those created after the closure of the Lucasfilm division by Disney and the transfer of the license to Electronic Arts.

==== Early licensed games (1979–1993) ====
The first officially licensed electronic &quot;Star Wars&quot; game was Kenner&#x27;s 1979 table-top &quot;Star Wars Electronic Battle Command&quot;. In 1982, Parker Brothers published the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; video game for the Atari 2600, &quot;Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, followed soon the year later by &quot;Star Wars: Jedi Arena&quot;, the first video game to depict lightsaber combat. They were followed in 1983 by Atari&#x27;s rail shooter arcade game &quot;Star Wars&quot;, with vector graphics to replicate the Death Star trench run scene from the 1977 film. The next game, &quot;Star Wars: Return of the Jedi&quot; (1984), has more traditional raster graphics, while the following &quot;Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1985) has vector graphics.

Platform games were made for the Nintendo Entertainment System, including the Japan-exclusive &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1987), an international &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1991), and &quot;Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1992). &quot;Super Star Wars&quot; (1992) was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, with two sequels over the next two years.

==== LucasArts and modern self-published games (1993–2014) ====

Lucasfilm founded its own video game company in 1982, becoming best known for adventure games and World War II flight combat games, but as George Lucas took more interest in the increasing success of the video game market, he wanted to have more creative control over the games and founded his own development company, LucasArts. Improved graphics allowed games to tell complex narratives, which allowed for the retelling of the films, and eventually original narratives set in the same continuity, with voice-overs and CGI cutscenes. In 1993, LucasArts released &quot;Star Wars: X-Wing&quot;, the first self-published &quot;Star Wars&quot; video game and the first space flight simulator based on the franchise. It was one of the bestselling video games of 1993 and established its own series of games. The &quot;Rogue Squadron&quot; series was released between 1998 and 2003, also focusing on space battles set during the films.

&quot;Dark Forces&quot; (1995), a hybrid adventure game incorporating puzzles and strategy, was the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; first-person shooter. It featured gameplay and graphical features not then common in other games, made possible by LucasArts&#x27; custom-designed game engine, the Jedi. The game was well received, and it was followed by four sequels. The series introduced Kyle Katarn, who would appear in multiple games, novels, and comics. Katarn is a former stormtrooper who joins the Rebellion and becomes a Jedi, a plot arc similar to that of Finn in the sequel trilogy films. A massively multiplayer online role-playing game, &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot;, was in operation from 2003 until 2011. After Disney bought Lucasfilm, LucasArts ceased its role as a developer in 2013, although it still operates as a licensor.

==== &quot;EA Star Wars&quot; (2014–present) ====
Following its acquisition of the franchise, Disney reassigned video game rights to Electronic Arts. Games made during this era are considered canonical, and feature more influence from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; filmmakers. Disney partnered with Lenovo to create the augmented reality video game &quot;Jedi Challenges&quot;, released in November 2017. In August 2018, it was announced that Zynga would publish free-to-play &quot;Star Wars&quot; mobile games. The &quot;Battlefront&quot; games received a canonical reboot with &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront&quot; in November 2015, which was followed by a sequel, &quot;Battlefront II&quot;, in November 2017. A single-player action-adventure game, &quot;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order&quot;, with an original story and cast of characters, was released in November 2019. A space combat game titled &quot;Star Wars: Squadrons&quot;, which builds upon the space battles from &quot;Battlefront&quot;, was released in October 2020.

=== Theme park attractions ===
In addition to the Disneyland ride Star Tours (1987) and its successor, Star Tours: The Adventures Continue (2011), many live attractions have been held at Disney parks, including the traveling exhibition Where Science Meets Imagination, the Space Mountain spin-off Hyperspace Mountain, a walkthrough Launch Bay, and the night-time &quot;A Galactic Spectacular&quot;. An immersive themed area called Galaxy&#x27;s Edge (2019) opened at Disneyland and opened at Walt Disney World in mid-2019. A themed hotel, &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Galactic Starcruiser, operated from 2022 to 2023 at Walt Disney World.

=== Multimedia projects ===
A multimedia project involves works released across multiple types of media. &quot;Shadows of the Empire&quot; (1996) was a multimedia project set between &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; that included a novel by Steve Perry, a comic book series, a video game, and action figures. &quot;The Force Unleashed&quot; (2008–2010) was a similar project set between &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; and &quot;A New Hope&quot; that included a novel, a 2008 video game and its 2010 sequel, a graphic novel, a role-playing game supplement, and toys.

=== Merchandising ===
The success of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films led the franchise to become one of the most merchandised franchises in the world. While filming the original 1977 film, George Lucas decided to take a $500,000 pay cut to his salary as director in exchange for full ownership of the franchise&#x27;s merchandising rights. By 1987, the first three films have made billion in merchandising revenue. By 2012, the first six films produced approximately billion in merchandising revenue.

Kenner Products made the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; action figures to coincide with the release of the original film, and today the original figures are highly valuable. Since the 1990s, Hasbro holds the rights to create action figures based on the saga. Pez dispensers began to be produced in 1997. &quot;Star Wars&quot; was the first intellectual property to be licensed in Lego history. Lego has produced animated parody short films and mini-series to promote their &quot;Star Wars&quot; sets. The Lego &quot;Star Wars&quot; video games are critically acclaimed bestsellers.

In 1977, the board game &quot;Star Wars: Escape from the Death Star&quot; was released. A &quot;Star Wars Monopoly&quot; and themed versions of &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot; and Battleship were released in 1997, with updated versions released in subsequent years. The board game &quot;Risk&quot; has been adapted in two editions by Hasbro: &quot;The Clone Wars Edition&quot; (2005) and the &quot;&quot; (2006). Three &quot;Star Wars&quot; tabletop role-playing games have been developed: a version by West End Games in the 1980s and 1990s, one by Wizards of the Coast in the 2000s, and one by Fantasy Flight Games in the 2010s.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; Trading Cards have been published since the first &quot;blue&quot; series, by Topps, in 1977. Dozens of series have been produced, with Topps being the licensed creator in the United States. Each card series are of film stills or original art. Many of the cards have become highly collectible with some very rare &quot;promos&quot;, such as the 1993 Galaxy Series II &quot;floating Yoda&quot; P3 card often commanding US$1,000 or more. While most &quot;base&quot; or &quot;common card&quot; sets are plentiful, many &quot;insert&quot; or &quot;chase cards&quot; are very rare. From 1995 until 2001, Decipher, Inc. had the license for, created, and produced the &quot;Star Wars Customizable Card Game&quot;.

== Themes ==

&quot;Star Wars&quot; features elements such as knighthood, chivalry, and Jungian archetypes such as &quot;the shadow&quot;.
There are also many references to Christianity, such as in the appearance of Darth Maul, whose design draws heavily from traditional depictions of the devil. Anakin was conceived of a virgin birth, and is assumed to be the &quot;Chosen One&quot;, a messianic individual. However, unlike Jesus, Anakin falls from grace, remaining evil as Darth Vader until &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. According to Adam Driver, sequel trilogy villain Kylo Ren, who idolizes Vader, believes he is &quot;doing what he thinks is right&quot;. George Lucas has said that the theme of the saga is redemption.

The saga draws heavily from the hero&#x27;s journey, an archetypical template developed by comparative mythologist Joseph Campbell. Each character—primarily Anakin, Luke, and Rey—follows the steps of the cycle or undergoes its reversal, becoming the villain. A defining step of the journey is &quot;Atonement with the Father&quot;. Obi-Wan&#x27;s loss of a father figure could have impacted his relationship with Anakin, whom both Obi-Wan and Palpatine are fatherlike mentors to. Luke&#x27;s discovery that Vader is his father has strong repercussions on the saga and is regarded as one of the most influential plot twists in cinema. Supreme Leader Snoke encourages Kylo Ren to kill his father, Han Solo. Kylo uses the fact that Rey is an orphan to tempt her into joining the dark side. According to &quot;Inverse&quot;, the final scene in &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;, which depicts servant children playing with a toy of Luke and one boy using the Force, symbolizes that &quot;the Force can be found in people with humble beginnings.&quot;

=== Historical influences ===
Political science has been an important element of &quot;Star Wars&quot; since the franchise launched in 1977, focusing on a struggle between democracy and dictatorship. Battles featuring the Ewoks and Gungans against the Empire and Trade Federation, respectively, represent the clash between a primitive society and a more advanced one, similar to the Vietnam-American War. Darth Vader&#x27;s design was initially inspired by Samurai armor, and also incorporated a German military helmet. Originally, Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the Emperor in the same way the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) served Adolf Hitler, but this was condensed into one character in the form of Vader. Stormtroopers borrow the name of World War I German &quot;shock&quot; troopers. Imperial officers wear uniforms resembling those of German forces during World War II, and political and security officers resemble the black-clad SS down to the stylized silver death&#x27;s head on their caps. World War II terms were used for names in the films; &quot;e.g.&quot; the planets Kessel (a term that refers to a group of encircled forces) and Hoth (after a German general who served on the snow-laden Eastern Front). Shots of the commanders looking through AT-AT walker viewscreens in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; resemble tank interiors, and space battles in the original film were based on World War I and World War II dogfights.

Palpatine being a chancellor before becoming the Emperor in the prequel trilogy alludes to Hitler&#x27;s role before appointing himself &quot;Führer&quot;. Lucas has also drawn parallels to historical dictators such as Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte, and politicians like Richard Nixon. The Great Jedi Purge mirrors the events of the Night of the Long Knives. The corruption of the Galactic Republic is modeled after the fall of the democratic Roman Republic and the formation of an empire.

On the inspiration for the First Order formed &quot;from the ashes of the Empire&quot;, &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; director J. J. Abrams spoke of conversations the writers had about how the Nazis could have escaped to Argentina after WWII and &quot;started working together again.&quot;

== Cultural impact ==
The &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga has had a significant impact on popular culture, with references to its fictional universe deeply embedded in everyday life. Phrases like &quot;evil empire&quot; and &quot;May the Force be with you&quot; have become part of the popular lexicon. The first &quot;Star Wars&quot; film in 1977 was a cultural unifier, enjoyed by a wide spectrum of people. The film can be said to have helped launch the science-fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making science-fiction films a mainstream genre. The widespread impact made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including &quot;Hardware Wars&quot;, &quot;Spaceballs&quot;, &quot;The Family Guy Trilogy&quot; and &quot;Robot Chicken: Star Wars&quot;.

In 1989, the Library of Congress selected the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry, as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; was selected in 2010, and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was selected in 2021. 35 mm reels of the 1997 Special Editions were the versions initially presented for preservation because of the difficulty of transferring from the original prints, but it was later revealed that the Library possesses a copyright deposit print of the original theatrical releases.

=== Industry ===
The original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film was a huge success for 20th Century Fox, and was credited for reinvigorating the company. Within three weeks of the film&#x27;s release, the studio&#x27;s stock price doubled to a record high. Prior to 1977, 20th Century Fox&#x27;s greatest annual profits were $37 million, while in 1977, the company broke that record by posting a profit of $79 million. The franchise helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt production company to a thriving media conglomerate. With over $10.3 billion in worldwide box office receipts, &quot;Star Wars&quot; is the second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.

&quot;Star Wars&quot; fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of Hollywood films, switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and irony to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. Before &quot;Star Wars&quot;, special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s. The commercial success of &quot;Star Wars&quot; created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s. Along with &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable franchises are important. It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.

Film critic Roger Ebert wrote in his book &quot;The Great Movies&quot;, &quot;Like &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot; was a technical watershed that influenced many of the movies that came after.&quot; It began a new generation of special effects and high-energy motion pictures. The film was one of the first films to link genres together to invent a new, high-concept genre for filmmakers to build upon. Finally, along with Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot;, it shifted the film industry&#x27;s focus away from personal filmmaking of the 1970s and towards fast-paced, big-budget blockbusters for younger audiences.

Some critics have blamed &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Jaws&quot; for &quot;ruining&quot; Hollywood by shifting its focus from &quot;sophisticated&quot; films such as &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, and &quot;Annie Hall&quot; to films about spectacle and juvenile fantasy, and for the industry shift from stand-alone, one and done films, towards blockbuster franchises with multiple sequels and prequels. One such critic, Peter Biskind, complained, &quot;When all was said and done, Lucas and Spielberg returned the 1970s audience, grown sophisticated on a diet of European and New Hollywood films, to the simplicities of the pre-1960s Golden Age of movies... They marched backward through the looking-glass.&quot; In an opposing view, Tom Shone wrote that through &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Jaws&quot;, Lucas and Spielberg &quot;didn&#x27;t betray cinema at all: they plugged it back into the grid, returning the medium to its roots as a carnival sideshow, a magic act, one big special effect&quot;, which was &quot;a kind of rebirth&quot;.

The original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy is widely considered one of the best film trilogies in history. Numerous filmmakers have been influenced by &quot;Star Wars&quot;, including Damon Lindelof, Dean Devlin, Roland Emmerich, John Lasseter, David Fincher, Joss Whedon, John Singleton, Kevin Smith, and later &quot;Star Wars&quot; directors J. J. Abrams and Gareth Edwards. Lucas&#x27;s concept of a &quot;used universe&quot; particularly influenced Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) and &quot;Alien&quot; (1979), James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986) as well as &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984), George Miller&#x27;s &quot;Mad Max 2&quot; (1981), and Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy (2001–2003). Christopher Nolan cited &quot;Star Wars&quot; as an influence when making the 2010 blockbuster film &quot;Inception&quot;.

==== Fan works ====

The &quot;Star Wars&quot; saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan fiction to creating fan films. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual Official &quot;Star Wars&quot; Fan Film Awards, officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential copyright and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to parodies, mockumentaries, and documentaries. Fan fiction films set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007, Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries. Lucasfilm has allowed but not endorsed the creation of fan fiction, as long as it does not attempt to make a profit.

=== Academia ===
As the characters and the storyline of the original trilogy are so well known, educators have used the films in the classroom as a learning resource. For example, a project in Western Australia honed elementary school students storytelling skills by role-playing action scenes from the movies and later creating props and audio/visual scenery to enhance their performance. Others have used the films to encourage second-level students to integrate technology in the science classroom by making prototype lightsabers. Similarly, psychiatrists in New Zealand and the U.S. have advocated their use in the university classroom to explain different types of psychopathology.
