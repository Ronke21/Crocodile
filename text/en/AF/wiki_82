<text>In multicellular organisms, stem cells are undifferentiated or partially differentiated cells that can change into various types of cells and proliferate indefinitely to produce more of the same stem cell. They are the earliest type of cell in a cell lineage. They are found in both embryonic and adult organisms, but they have slightly different properties in each. They are usually distinguished from progenitor cells, which cannot divide indefinitely, and precursor or blast cells, which are usually committed to differentiating into one cell type.

In mammals, roughly 50 to 150 cells make up the inner cell mass during the blastocyst stage of embryonic development, around days 5–14. These have stem-cell capability. &quot;In vivo&quot;, they eventually differentiate into all of the body&#x27;s cell types (making them pluripotent). This process starts with the differentiation into the three germ layers – the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm – at the gastrulation stage. However, when they are isolated and cultured &quot;in vitro&quot;, they can be kept in the stem-cell stage and are known as embryonic stem cells (ESCs).

Adult stem cells are found in a few select locations in the body, known as niches, such as those in the bone marrow or gonads. They exist to replenish rapidly lost cell types and are multipotent or unipotent, meaning they only differentiate into a few cell types or one type of cell. In mammals, they include, among others, hematopoietic stem cells, which replenish blood and immune cells, basal cells, which maintain the skin epithelium, and mesenchymal stem cells, which maintain bone, cartilage, muscle and fat cells. Adult stem cells are a small minority of cells; they are vastly outnumbered by the progenitor cells and terminally differentiated cells that they differentiate into.

Research into stem cells grew out of findings by Canadian biologists Ernest McCulloch, James Till and Andrew J. Becker at the University of Toronto and the Ontario Cancer Institute in the 1960s. , the only established medical therapy using stem cells is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, first performed in 1958 by French oncologist Georges Mathé. Since 1998 however, it has been possible to culture and differentiate human embryonic stem cells (in stem-cell lines). The process of isolating these cells has been controversial, because it typically results in the destruction of the embryo. Sources for isolating ESCs have been restricted in some European countries and Canada, but others such as the UK and China have promoted the research. Somatic cell nuclear transfer is a cloning method that can be used to create a cloned embryo for the use of its embryonic stem cells in stem cell therapy. In 2006, a Japanese team led by Shinya Yamanaka discovered a method to convert mature body cells back into stem cells. These were termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).

== History ==
The term &quot;stem cell&quot; was coined by Theodor Boveri and Valentin Haecker in late 19th century. Pioneering works in theory of blood stem cell were conducted in the beginning of 20th century by Artur Pappenheim, Alexander A. Maximow, Franz Ernst Christian Neumann.

The key properties of a stem cell were first defined by Ernest McCulloch and James Till at the University of Toronto and the Ontario Cancer Institute in the early 1960s. They discovered the blood-forming stem cell, the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), through their pioneering work in mice. McCulloch and Till began a series of experiments in which bone marrow cells were injected into irradiated mice. They observed lumps in the spleens of the mice that were linearly proportional to the number of bone marrow cells injected. They hypothesized that each lump (colony) was a clone arising from a single marrow cell (stem cell). In subsequent work, McCulloch and Till, joined by graduate student Andrew John Becker and senior scientist Louis Siminovitch, confirmed that each lump did in fact arise from a single cell. Their results were published in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1963. In that same year, Siminovitch was a lead investigator for studies that found colony-forming cells were capable of self-renewal, which is a key defining property of stem cells that Till and McCulloch had theorized.

The first therapy using stem cells was a bone marrow transplant performed by French oncologist Georges Mathé in 1956 on five workers at the Vinča Nuclear Institute in Yugoslavia who had been affected by a criticality accident. The workers all survived.

In 1981, embryonic stem (ES) cells were first isolated and successfully cultured using mouse blastocysts by British biologists Martin Evans and Matthew Kaufman. This allowed the formation of murine genetic models, a system in which the genes of mice are deleted or altered in order to study their function in pathology. In 1991, a process that allowed the human stem cell to be isolated was patented by Ann Tsukamoto. By 1998, human embryonic stem cells were first isolated by American biologist James Thomson, which made it possible to have new transplantation methods or various cell types for testing new treatments. In 2006, Shinya Yamanaka&#x27;s team in Kyoto, Japan converted fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells by modifying the expression of only four genes. The feat represents the origin of induced pluripotent stem cells, known as iPS cells.

In 2011, a female maned wolf, run over by a truck, underwent stem cell treatment at the , this being the first recorded case of the use of stem cells to heal injuries in a wild animal.

==Properties==
The classical definition of a stem cell requires that it possesses two properties:
* Self-renewal: the ability to go through numerous cycles of cell growth and cell division, known as cell proliferation, while maintaining the undifferentiated state.
* Potency: the capacity to differentiate into specialized cell types. In the strictest sense, this requires stem cells to be either totipotent or pluripotent—to be able to give rise to any mature cell type, although multipotent or unipotent progenitor cells are sometimes referred to as stem cells. Apart from this, it is said that stem cell function is regulated in a feedback mechanism.

===Self-renewal===
Two mechanisms ensure that a stem cell population is maintained (does not shrink in size):

1. Asymmetric cell division: a stem cell divides into one mother cell, which is identical to the original stem cell, and another daughter cell, which is differentiated.

When a stem cell self-renews, it divides and disrupts the undifferentiated state. This self-renewal demands control of cell cycle as well as upkeep of multipotency or pluripotency, which all depends on the stem cell.

H.

Stem cells use telomerase, a protein that restores telomeres, to protect their DNA and extend their cell division limit (the Hayflick limit).

===Potency meaning===


Potency specifies the differentiation potential (the potential to differentiate into different cell types) of the stem cell.
* Totipotent (also known as omnipotent) stem cells can differentiate into embryonic and extraembryonic cell types. Such cells can construct a complete, viable organism. These cells are produced from the fusion of an egg and sperm cell. Cells produced by the first few divisions of the fertilized egg are also totipotent.
* Pluripotent stem cells are the descendants of totipotent cells and can differentiate into nearly all cells, i.e. cells derived from any of the three germ layers.
* Multipotent stem cells can differentiate into a number of cell types, but only those of a closely related family of cells.
* Oligopotent stem cells can differentiate into only a few cell types, such as lymphoid or myeloid stem cells.
* Unipotent cells can produce only one cell type, their own, but have the property of self-renewal, which distinguishes them from non-stem cells

===Identification===
In practice, stem cells are identified by whether they can regenerate tissue. For example, the defining test for bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) is the ability to transplant the cells and save an individual without HSCs. This demonstrates that the cells can produce new blood cells over a long term. It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs, demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew.

Properties of stem cells can be illustrated &quot;in vitro&quot;, using methods such as clonogenic assays, in which single cells are assessed for their ability to differentiate and self-renew. Stem cells can also be isolated by their possession of a distinctive set of cell surface markers. However, &quot;in vitro&quot; culture conditions can alter the behavior of cells, making it unclear whether the cells shall behave in a similar manner &quot;in vivo&quot;. There is considerable debate as to whether some proposed adult cell populations are truly stem cells.

==Embryonic==
Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are the cells of the inner cell mass of a blastocyst, formed prior to implantation in the uterus. In human embryonic development the blastocyst stage is reached 4–5 days after fertilization, at which time it consists of 50–150 cells. ESCs are pluripotent and give rise during development to all derivatives of the three germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm and mesoderm. In other words, they can develop into each of the more than 200 cell types of the adult body when given sufficient and necessary stimulation for a specific cell type. They do not contribute to the extraembryonic membranes or to the placenta.

During embryonic development the cells of the inner cell mass continuously divide and become more specialized. For example, a portion of the ectoderm in the dorsal part of the embryo specializes as &#x27;neurectoderm&#x27;, which will become the future central nervous system (CNS). Later in development, neurulation causes the neurectoderm to form the neural tube. At the neural tube stage, the anterior portion undergoes encephalization to generate or &#x27;pattern&#x27; the basic form of the brain. At this stage of development, the principal cell type of the CNS is considered a neural stem cell.

The neural stem cells self-renew and at some point transition into radial glial progenitor cells (RGPs). Early-formed RGPs self-renew by symmetrical division to form a reservoir group of progenitor cells. These cells transition to a neurogenic state and start to divide asymmetrically to produce a large diversity of many different neuron types, each with unique gene expression, morphological, and functional characteristics. The process of generating neurons from radial glial cells is called neurogenesis. The radial glial cell, has a distinctive bipolar morphology with highly elongated processes spanning the thickness of the neural tube wall. It shares some glial characteristics, most notably the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The radial glial cell is the primary neural stem cell of the developing vertebrate CNS, and its cell body resides in the ventricular zone, adjacent to the developing ventricular system. Neural stem cells are committed to the neuronal lineages (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes), and thus their potency is restricted.

Nearly all research to date has made use of mouse embryonic stem cells (mES) or human embryonic stem cells (hES) derived from the early inner cell mass. Both have the essential stem cell characteristics, yet they require very different environments in order to maintain an undifferentiated state. Mouse ES cells are grown on a layer of gelatin as an extracellular matrix (for support) and require the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in serum media. A drug cocktail containing inhibitors to GSK3B and the MAPK/ERK pathway, called 2i, has also been shown to maintain pluripotency in stem cell culture. Human ESCs are grown on a feeder layer of mouse embryonic fibroblasts and require the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF or FGF-2). Without optimal culture conditions or genetic manipulation, embryonic stem cells will rapidly differentiate.

A human embryonic stem cell is also defined by the expression of several transcription factors and cell surface proteins. The transcription factors Oct-4, Nanog, and Sox2 form the core regulatory network that ensures the suppression of genes that lead to differentiation and the maintenance of pluripotency. The cell surface antigens most commonly used to identify hES cells are the glycolipids stage specific embryonic antigen 3 and 4, and the keratan sulfate antigens Tra-1-60 and Tra-1-81. The molecular definition of a stem cell includes many more proteins and continues to be a topic of research.

By using human embryonic stem cells to produce specialized cells like nerve cells or heart cells in the lab, scientists can gain access to adult human cells without taking tissue from patients. They can then study these specialized adult cells in detail to try to discern complications of diseases, or to study cell reactions to proposed new drugs.

Because of their combined abilities of unlimited expansion and pluripotency, embryonic stem cells remain a theoretically potential source for regenerative medicine and tissue replacement after injury or disease., however, there are currently no approved treatments using ES cells. The first human trial was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in January 2009. However, the human trial was not initiated until October 13, 2010, in Atlanta for spinal cord injury research. On November 14, 2011, the company conducting the trial (Geron Corporation) announced that it will discontinue further development of its stem cell programs. Differentiating ES cells into usable cells while avoiding transplant rejection are just a few of the hurdles that embryonic stem cell researchers still face. Embryonic stem cells, being pluripotent, require specific signals for correct differentiation – if injected directly into another body, ES cells will differentiate into many different types of cells, causing a teratoma. Ethical considerations regarding the use of unborn human tissue are another reason for the lack of approved treatments using embryonic stem cells. Many nations currently have moratoria or limitations on either human ES cell research or the production of new human ES cell lines. 
=== Mesenchymal stem cells ===
Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) or mesenchymal stromal cells, also known as medicinal signaling cells are known to be multipotent, which can be found in adult tissues, for example, in the muscle, liver, bone marrow and adipose tissue. Mesenchymal stem cells usually function as structural support in various organs as mentioned above, and control the movement of substances. MSC can differentiate into numerous cell categories as an illustration of adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes, derived by the mesodermal layer. Where the mesoderm layer provides an increase to the body&#x27;s skeletal elements, such as relating to the cartilage or bone. The term &quot;meso&quot; means middle, infusion originated from the Greek, signifying that mesenchymal cells are able to range and travel in early embryonic growth among the ectodermal and endodermal layers. This mechanism helps with space-filling thus, key for repairing wounds in adult organisms that have to do with mesenchymal cells in the dermis (skin), bone, or muscle.

Mesenchymal stem cells are known to be essential for regenerative medicine. They are broadly studied in clinical trials. Since they are easily isolated and obtain high yield, high plasticity, which makes able to facilitate inflammation and encourage cell growth, cell differentiation, and restoring tissue derived from immunomodulation and immunosuppression. MSC comes from the bone marrow, which requires an aggressive procedure when it comes to isolating the quantity and quality of the isolated cell, and it varies by how old the donor. When comparing the rates of MSC in the bone marrow aspirates and bone marrow stroma, the aspirates tend to have lower rates of MSC than the stroma. MSC are known to be heterogeneous, and they express a high level of pluripotent markers when compared to other types of stem cells, such as embryonic stem cells. MSCs injection leads to wound healing primarily through stimulation of angiogenesis.

=== Cell cycle control ===

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) have the ability to divide indefinitely while keeping their pluripotency, which is made possible through specialized mechanisms of cell cycle control. Compared to proliferating somatic cells, ESCs have unique cell cycle characteristics—such as rapid cell division caused by shortened G1 phase, absent G0 phase, and modifications in cell cycle checkpoints—which leaves the cells mostly in S phase at any given time. ESCs&#x27; rapid division is demonstrated by their short doubling time, which ranges from 8 to 10 hours, whereas somatic cells have doubling time of approximately 20 hours or longer. As cells differentiate, these properties change: G1 and G2 phases lengthen, leading to longer cell division cycles. This suggests that a specific cell cycle structure may contribute to the establishment of pluripotency.

Particularly because G1 phase is the phase in which cells have increased sensitivity to differentiation, shortened G1 is one of the key characteristics of ESCs and plays an important role in maintaining undifferentiated phenotype. Although the exact molecular mechanism remains only partially understood, several studies have shown insight on how ESCs progress through G1—and  potentially other phases—so rapidly.

The cell cycle is regulated by complex network of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (Cdkn), pocket proteins of the retinoblastoma (Rb) family, and other accessory factors. Foundational insight into the distinctive regulation of ESC cell cycle was gained by studies on mouse ESCs (mESCs). mESCs showed a cell cycle with highly abbreviated G1 phase, which enabled cells to rapidly alternate between M phase and S phase. In a somatic cell cycle, oscillatory activity of Cyclin-Cdk complexes is observed in sequential action, which controls crucial regulators of the cell cycle to induce unidirectional transitions between phases: Cyclin D and Cdk4/6 are active in the G1 phase, while Cyclin E and Cdk2 are active during the late G1 phase and S phase; and Cyclin A and Cdk2 are active in the S phase and G2, while Cyclin B and Cdk1 are active in G2 and M phase. However, in mESCs, this typically ordered and oscillatory activity of Cyclin-Cdk complexes is absent. Rather, the Cyclin E/Cdk2 complex is constitutively active throughout the cycle, keeping retinoblastoma protein (pRb) hyperphosphorylated and thus inactive. This allows for direct transition from M phase to the late G1 phase, leading to absence of D-type cyclins and therefore a shortened G1 phase. Cdk2 activity is crucial for both cell cycle regulation and cell-fate decisions in mESCs; downregulation of Cdk2 activity prolongs G1 phase progression, establishes a somatic cell-like cell cycle, and induces expression of differentiation markers.

In human ESCs (hESCs), the duration of G1 is dramatically shortened. This has been attributed to high mRNA levels of G1-related Cyclin D2 and Cdk4 genes and low levels of cell cycle regulatory proteins that inhibit cell cycle progression at G1, such as p21CipP1, p27Kip1, and p57Kip2. Furthermore, regulators of Cdk4 and Cdk6 activity, such as members of the Ink family of inhibitors (p15, p16, p18, and p19), are expressed at low levels or not at all. Thus, similar to mESCs, hESCs show high Cdk activity, with Cdk2 exhibiting the highest kinase activity. Also similar to mESCs, hESCs demonstrate the importance of Cdk2 in G1 phase regulation by showing that G1 to S transition is delayed when Cdk2 activity is inhibited and G1 is arrest when Cdk2 is knocked down. However unlike mESCs, hESCs have a functional G1 phase. hESCs show that the activities of Cyclin E/Cdk2 and Cyclin A/Cdk2 complexes are cell cycle-dependent and the Rb checkpoint in G1 is functional.

ESCs are also characterized by G1 checkpoint non-functionality, even though the G1 checkpoint is crucial for maintaining genomic stability. In response to DNA damage, ESCs do not stop in G1 to repair DNA damages but instead, depend on S and G2/M checkpoints or undergo apoptosis. The absence of G1 checkpoint in ESCs allows for the removal of cells with damaged DNA, hence avoiding potential mutations from inaccurate DNA repair. Consistent with this idea, ESCs are hypersensitive to DNA damage to minimize mutations passed onto the next generation.

==Fetal==
The primitive stem cells located in the organs of fetuses are referred to as fetal stem cells.

There are two types of fetal stem cells:

# Fetal proper stem cells come from the tissue of the fetus proper and are generally obtained after an abortion. These stem cells are not immortal but have a high level of division and are multipotent.
# Extraembryonic fetal stem cells come from extraembryonic membranes, and are generally not distinguished from adult stem cells. These stem cells are acquired after birth, they are not immortal but have a high level of cell division, and are pluripotent.

==Adult==


Adult stem cells, also called somatic (from Greek σωματικóς, &quot;of the body&quot;) stem cells, are stem cells which maintain and repair the tissue in which they are found.

There are three known accessible sources of autologous adult stem cells in humans:
# Bone marrow, which requires extraction by &quot;harvesting&quot;, usually from pelvic bones via surgery.
# Adipose tissue (fat cells), which requires extraction by liposuction.
# Blood, which requires extraction through apheresis, wherein blood is drawn from the donor (similar to a blood donation), and passed through a machine that extracts the stem cells and returns other portions of the blood to the donor.
Stem cells can also be taken from umbilical cord blood just after birth. Of all stem cell types, autologous harvesting involves the least risk. By definition, autologous cells are obtained from one&#x27;s own body, just as one may bank their own blood for elective surgical procedures.

Pluripotent adult stem cells are rare and generally small in number, but they can be found in umbilical cord blood and other tissues. Bone marrow is a rich source of adult stem cells, which have been used in treating several conditions including liver cirrhosis, chronic limb ischemia and endstage heart failure. The quantity of bone marrow stem cells declines with age and is greater in males than females during reproductive years. Much adult stem cell research to date has aimed to characterize their potency and self-renewal capabilities. DNA damage accumulates with age in both stem cells and the cells that comprise the stem cell environment. This accumulation is considered to be responsible, at least in part, for increasing stem cell dysfunction with aging (see DNA damage theory of aging).

Most adult stem cells are lineage-restricted (multipotent) and are generally referred to by their tissue origin (mesenchymal stem cell, adipose-derived stem cell, endothelial stem cell, dental pulp stem cell, etc.). Muse cells (multi-lineage differentiating stress enduring cells) are a recently discovered pluripotent stem cell type found in multiple adult tissues, including adipose, dermal fibroblasts, and bone marrow. While rare, muse cells are identifiable by their expression of SSEA-3, a marker for undifferentiated stem cells, and general mesenchymal stem cells markers such as CD90, CD105. When subjected to single cell suspension culture, the cells will generate clusters that are similar to embryoid bodies in morphology as well as gene expression, including canonical pluripotency markers Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog.

Adult stem cell treatments have been successfully used for many years to treat leukemia and related bone/blood cancers through bone marrow transplants. Adult stem cells are also used in veterinary medicine to treat tendon and ligament injuries in horses.

The use of adult stem cells in research and therapy is not as controversial as the use of embryonic stem cells, because the production of adult stem cells does not require the destruction of an embryo. Additionally, in instances where adult stem cells are obtained from the intended recipient (an autograft), the risk of rejection is essentially non-existent. Consequently, more US government funding is being provided for adult stem cell research.

With the increasing demand of human adult stem cells for both research and clinical purposes (typically 1–5 million cells per kg of body weight are required per treatment) it becomes of utmost importance to bridge the gap between the need to expand the cells in vitro and the capability of harnessing the factors underlying replicative senescence. Adult stem cells are known to have a limited lifespan in vitro and to enter replicative senescence almost undetectably upon starting in vitro culturing.

===Hematopoietic stem cells===

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are vulnerable to DNA damage and mutations that increase with age. This vulnerability may explain the increased risk of slow growing blood cancers (myeloid malignancies) in the elderly. Several factors appear to influence HSC aging including responses to the production of reactive oxygen species that may cause DNA damage and genetic mutations as well as altered epigenetic profiling.

==Amniotic==
Also called perinatal stem cells, these multipotent stem cells are found in amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood. These stem cells are very active, expand extensively without feeders and are not tumorigenic. Amniotic stem cells are multipotent and can differentiate in cells of adipogenic, osteogenic, myogenic, endothelial, hepatic and also neuronal lines.
Amniotic stem cells are a topic of active research.

Use of stem cells from amniotic fluid overcomes the ethical objections to using human embryos as a source of cells. Roman Catholic teaching forbids the use of embryonic stem cells in experimentation; accordingly, the Vatican newspaper &quot;Osservatore Romano&quot; called amniotic stem cells &quot;the future of medicine&quot;.

It is possible to collect amniotic stem cells for donors or for autologous use: the first US amniotic stem cells bank was opened in 2009 in Medford, MA, by Biocell Center Corporation and collaborates with various hospitals and universities all over the world.

==Induced pluripotent==
Adult stem cells have limitations with their potency; unlike embryonic stem cells (ESCs), they are not able to differentiate into cells from all three germ layers. As such, they are deemed multipotent.

However, reprogramming allows for the creation of pluripotent cells, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), from adult cells. These are not adult stem cells, but somatic cells (e.g. epithelial cells) reprogrammed to give rise to cells with pluripotent capabilities. Using genetic reprogramming with protein transcription factors, pluripotent stem cells with ESC-like capabilities have been derived. The first demonstration of induced pluripotent stem cells was conducted by Shinya Yamanaka and his colleagues at Kyoto University. They used the transcription factors Oct3/4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4 to reprogram mouse fibroblast cells into pluripotent cells. Subsequent work used these factors to induce pluripotency in human fibroblast cells. Junying Yu, James Thomson, and their colleagues at the University of Wisconsin–Madison used a different set of factors, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Lin28, and carried out their experiments using cells from human foreskin. However, they were able to replicate Yamanaka&#x27;s finding that inducing pluripotency in human cells was possible.

Induced pluripotent stem cells differ from embryonic stem cells. They share many similar properties, such as pluripotency and differentiation potential, the expression of pluripotency genes, epigenetic patterns, embryoid body and teratoma formation, and viable chimera formation, but there are many differences within these properties. The chromatin of iPSCs appears to be more &quot;closed&quot; or methylated than that of ESCs. Similarly, the gene expression pattern between ESCs and iPSCs, or even iPSCs sourced from different origins. There are thus questions about the &quot;completeness&quot; of reprogramming and the somatic memory of induced pluripotent stem cells. Despite this, inducing somatic cells to be pluripotent appears to be viable.

As a result of the success of these experiments, Ian Wilmut, who helped create the first cloned animal Dolly the Sheep, has announced that he will abandon somatic cell nuclear transfer as an avenue of research.

The ability to induce pluripotency benefits developments in tissue engineering. By providing a suitable scaffold and microenvironment, iPSC can be differentiated into cells of therapeutic application, and for &quot;in vitro&quot; models to study toxins and pathogenesis.

Induced pluripotent stem cells provide several therapeutic advantages. Like ESCs, they are pluripotent. They thus have great differentiation potential; theoretically, they could produce any cell within the human body (if reprogramming to pluripotency was &quot;complete&quot;). Moreover, unlike ESCs, they potentially could allow doctors to create a pluripotent stem cell line for each individual patient. Frozen blood samples can be used as a valuable source of induced pluripotent stem cells. Patient specific stem cells allow for the screening for side effects before drug treatment, as well as the reduced risk of transplantation rejection. Despite their current limited use therapeutically, iPSCs hold great potential for future use in medical treatment and research.

=== Cell cycle control ===
The key factors controlling the cell cycle also regulate pluripotency. Thus, manipulation of relevant genes can maintain pluripotency and reprogram somatic cells to an induced pluripotent state. However, reprogramming of somatic cells is often low in efficiency and considered stochastic.

With the idea that a more rapid cell cycle is a key component of pluripotency, reprogramming efficiency can be improved. Methods for improving pluripotency through manipulation of cell cycle regulators include: overexpression of Cyclin D/Cdk4, phosphorylation of Sox2 at S39 and S253, overexpression of Cyclin A and Cyclin E, knockdown of Rb, and knockdown of members of the Cip/Kip family or the Ink family. Furthermore, reprogramming efficiency is correlated with the number of cell divisions happened during the stochastic phase, which is suggested by the growing inefficiency of reprogramming of older or slow diving cells.

==Lineage==

Lineage is an important procedure to analyze developing embryos. Since cell lineages shows the relationship between cells at each division. This helps in analyzing stem cell lineages along the way which helps recognize stem cell effectiveness, lifespan, and other factors. With the technique of cell lineage mutant genes can be analyzed in stem cell clones that can help in genetic pathways. These pathways can regulate how the stem cell perform.

To ensure self-renewal, stem cells undergo two types of cell division (see &quot;Stem cell division and differentiation&quot; diagram). Symmetric division gives rise to two identical daughter cells both endowed with stem cell properties. Asymmetric division, on the other hand, produces only one stem cell and a progenitor cell with limited self-renewal potential. Progenitors can go through several rounds of cell division before terminally differentiating into a mature cell. It is possible that the molecular distinction between symmetric and asymmetric divisions lies in differential segregation of cell membrane proteins (such as receptors) between the daughter cells.

An alternative theory is that stem cells remain undifferentiated due to environmental cues in their particular niche. Stem cells differentiate when they leave that niche or no longer receive those signals. Studies in &quot;Drosophila&quot; germarium have identified the signals decapentaplegic and adherens junctions that prevent germarium stem cells from differentiating.

In the United States, Executive Order 13505 established that federal money can be used for research in which approved human embryonic stem-cell (hESC) lines are used, but it cannot be used to derive new lines. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines on Human Stem Cell Research, effective July 7, 2009, implemented the Executive Order 13505 by establishing criteria which hESC lines must meet to be approved for funding. The NIH Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry can be accessed online and has updated information on cell lines eligible for NIH funding. There are 486 approved lines as of January 2022.

==Therapies==
Stem cell therapy is the use of stem cells to treat or prevent a disease or condition. Bone marrow transplant is a form of stem cell therapy that has been used for many years because it has proven to be effective in clinical trials. Stem cell implantation may help in strengthening the left-ventricle of the heart, as well as retaining the heart tissue to patients who have suffered from heart attacks in the past.

For over 50 years, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been used to treat people with conditions such as leukaemia and lymphoma; this is the only widely practiced form of stem-cell therapy. , the only established therapy using stem cells is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This usually takes the form of a bone-marrow transplantation, but the cells can also be derived from umbilical cord blood. Research is underway to develop various sources for stem cells as well as to apply stem-cell treatments for neurodegenerative diseases and conditions such as diabetes and heart disease.

=== Advantages ===
Stem cell treatments may lower symptoms of the disease or condition that is being treated. The lowering of symptoms may allow patients to reduce the drug intake of the disease or condition. Stem cell treatment may also provide knowledge for society to further stem cell understanding and future treatments. The physicians&#x27; creed would be to do no injury, and stem cells make that simpler than ever before. Surgical processes by their character are harmful. Tissue has to be dropped as a way to reach a successful outcome. One may prevent the dangers of surgical interventions using stem cells. Additionally, there&#x27;s a possibility of disease, and whether the procedure fails, further surgery may be required. Risks associated with anesthesia can also be eliminated with stem cells. On top of that, stem cells have been harvested from the patient&#x27;s body and redeployed in which they&#x27;re wanted. Since they come from the patient&#x27;s own body, this is referred to as an autologous treatment. Autologous remedies are thought to be the safest because there&#x27;s likely zero probability of donor substance rejection.

===Disadvantages===
Stem cell treatments may require immunosuppression because of a requirement for radiation before the transplant to remove the person&#x27;s previous cells, or because the patient&#x27;s immune system may target the stem cells. One approach to avoid the second possibility is to use stem cells from the same patient who is being treated.

Pluripotency in certain stem cells could also make it difficult to obtain a specific cell type. It is also difficult to obtain the exact cell type needed, because not all cells in a population differentiate uniformly. Undifferentiated cells can create tissues other than desired types.

Some stem cells form tumors after transplantation; pluripotency is linked to tumor formation especially in embryonic stem cells, fetal proper stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells. Fetal proper stem cells form tumors despite multipotency.

Ethical concerns are also raised about the practice of using or researching embryonic stem cells. Harvesting cells from the blastocyst results in the death of the blastocyst. The concern is whether or not the blastocyst should be considered as a human life. The debate on this issue is mainly a philosophical one, not a scientific one.

=== Stem cell tourism ===
Stem cell tourism is the part of the medical tourism industry in which patients travel to obtain stem cell procedures.

The United States has had an explosion of &quot;stem cell clinics&quot;. Stem cell procedures are highly profitable for clinics. The advertising sounds authoritative but the efficacy and safety of the procedures is unproven. Patients sometimes experience complications, such as spinal tumors and death. The high expense can also lead to financial problems. According to researchers, there is a need to educate the public, patients, and doctors about this issue.

According to the International Society for Stem Cell Research, the largest academic organization that advocates for stem cell research, stem cell therapies are under development and cannot yet be said to be proven. Doctors should inform patients that clinical trials continue to investigate whether these therapies are safe and effective but that unethical clinics present them as proven.

==Research==
Some of the fundamental patents covering human embryonic stem cells are owned by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) – they are patents 5,843,780, 6,200,806, and 7,029,913 invented by James A. Thomson. WARF does not enforce these patents against academic scientists, but does enforce them against companies.

In 2006, a request for the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to re-examine the three patents was filed by the Public Patent Foundation on behalf of its client, the non-profit patent-watchdog group Consumer Watchdog (formerly the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights). In the re-examination process, which involves several rounds of discussion between the USPTO and the parties, the USPTO initially agreed with Consumer Watchdog and rejected all the claims in all three patents, however in response, WARF amended the claims of all three patents to make them more narrow, and in 2008 the USPTO found the amended claims in all three patents to be patentable. The decision on one of the patents (7,029,913) was appealable, while the decisions on the other two were not. Consumer Watchdog appealed the granting of the &#x27;913 patent to the USPTO&#x27;s Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (BPAI) which granted the appeal, and in 2010 the BPAI decided that the amended claims of the &#x27;913 patent were not patentable. However, WARF was able to re-open prosecution of the case and did so, amending the claims of the &#x27;913 patent again to make them more narrow, and in January 2013 the amended claims were allowed.

In July 2013, Consumer Watchdog announced that it would appeal the decision to allow the claims of the &#x27;913 patent to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC), the federal appeals court that hears patent cases. At a hearing in December 2013, the CAFC raised the question of whether Consumer Watchdog had legal standing to appeal; the case could not proceed until that issue was resolved.

===Conditions===

Diseases and conditions where stem cell treatment is being investigated include:
* Diabetes
*Androgenic Alopecia and hair loss
* Rheumatoid arthritis
* Parkinson&#x27;s disease
* Alzheimer&#x27;s disease
* Respiratory disease
* Osteoarthritis
* Stroke and traumatic brain injury repair
* Learning disability due to congenital disorder
* Spinal cord injury repair
* Heart infarction
* Anti-cancer treatments
* Baldness reversal
* Replace missing teeth
* Repair hearing
* Restore vision and repair damage to the cornea
* Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
* Crohn&#x27;s disease
* Wound healing
* Male infertility due to absence of spermatogonial stem cells. In recent studies, scientists have found a way to solve this problem by reprogramming a cell and turning it into a spermatozoon. Other studies have proven the restoration of spermatogenesis by introducing human iPSC cells in mice testicles. This could mean the end of azoospermia.
* Female infertility: oocytes made from embryonic stem cells. Scientists have found the ovarian stem cells, a rare type of cells (0.014%) found in the ovary. They could be used as a treatment not only for infertility, but also for premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). New research posted in Science Direct suggests that ovarian follicles could be triggered to grow in the ovarian environment by using stem cells present in bone marrow. This study was conducted by infusing human bone marrow stem cells into immune-deficient mice to imrpove fertilization. Another study conducted using mice with damaged ovarian function from chemothearpy found that in vivo thearpy with bone marrow stem cells can heal the damaged ovaries. Both of these studies are proof-of-concept and need to be furthered tested, but they have the possibility improve fertility for individuals who have POI from chemothearpy treatment. 
* Critical Limb Ischemia

=== Production ===
Research is underway to develop various sources for stem cells.

=== Organoids ===
Research is attempting to generating organoids using stem cells, which would allow for further understanding of human development, organogenesis, and modeling of human diseases. Engineered ‘synthetic organizer’ (SO) cells can instruct stem cells to grow into specific tissues and organs. The program used native and synthetic cell adhesion protein molecules (CAMs) that help make cells sticky. The organizer cells self-assembled around mouse ESCs. These cells were engineered to produce morphogens (signaling molecules) that direct cellular development based on their concentration. Delivered morphogens disperse, leaving higher concentrations closer to the source and lower concentrations further away. These gradients signal cells&#x27; ultimate roles, such as nerve, skin cell, or connective tissue. The engineered organizer cells were also fitted with a chemical switch that enabled the researchers to turn the delivery of cellular instructions on and off, as well as a ‘suicide switch’ for eliminating the cells when needed. SOs carry spatial and biochemical information, allowing considerable discretion in organoid formation.

=== Risks ===
Hepatotoxicity and drug-induced liver injury account for a substantial number of failures of new drugs in development and market withdrawal, highlighting the need for screening assays such as stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells, that are capable of detecting toxicity early in the drug development process.

=== Dormancy ===
In August 2021, researchers in the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre at the University Health Network published their discovery of a dormancy mechanism in key stem cells which could help develop cancer treatments in the future.

<text>Sappho (; &quot;Sapphṓ&quot; ; Aeolic Greek &quot;Psápphō&quot;; ) was an Archaic Greek poet from Eresos or Mytilene on the island of Lesbos. Sappho is known for her lyric poetry, written to be sung while accompanied by music. In ancient times, Sappho was widely regarded as one of the greatest lyric poets and was given names such as the &quot;Tenth Muse&quot; and &quot;The Poetess&quot;. Most of Sappho&#x27;s poetry is now lost, and what is not has mostly survived in fragmentary form; only the Ode to Aphrodite is certainly complete. As well as lyric poetry, ancient commentators claimed that Sappho wrote elegiac and iambic poetry. Three epigrams formerly attributed to Sappho have survived, but these are actually Hellenistic imitations of Sappho&#x27;s style.

Little is known of Sappho&#x27;s life. She was from a wealthy family from Lesbos, though her parents&#x27; names are uncertain. Ancient sources say that she had three brothers: Charaxos, Larichos and Eurygios. Two of them, Charaxos and Larichos, are mentioned in the Brothers Poem discovered in 2014. She was exiled to Sicily around 600BC, and may have continued to work until around 570BC. According to legend, she killed herself by leaping from the Leucadian cliffs due to her unrequited love for the ferryman Phaon.

Sappho was a prolific poet, probably composing around 10,000 lines. She was best-known in antiquity for her love poetry; other themes in the surviving fragments of her work include family and religion. She probably wrote poetry for both individual and choral performance. Most of her best-known and best-preserved fragments explore personal emotions and were probably composed for solo performance. Her works are known for their clarity of language, vivid images, and immediacy. The context in which she composed her poems has long been the subject of scholarly debate; the most influential suggestions have been that she had some sort of educational or religious role, or wrote for the symposium.

Sappho&#x27;s poetry was well-known and greatly admired through much of antiquity, and she was among the canon of Nine Lyric Poets most highly esteemed by scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria. Sappho&#x27;s poetry is still considered extraordinary and her works continue to influence other writers. Beyond her poetry, she is well known as a symbol of love and desire between women, with the English words &quot;sapphic&quot; and &quot;lesbian&quot; deriving from her name and that of her home island, respectively.

==Ancient sources==

Modern knowledge of Sappho comes both from what can be inferred from her own poetry and from mentions of her in other ancient texts. Her poetry – which, with the exception of a single complete poem, survives only in fragments – is the only contemporary source for her life. The earliest surviving biography of Sappho dates to the late second or early third centuryAD, approximately eight centuries after her own lifetime; the next is the &quot;Suda&quot;, a tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia. Other sources that mention details of her life were written much closer to her own era, beginning in the fifth centuryBC; one of the earliest is Herodotus&#x27; account of the relationship between the Egyptian courtesan Rhodopis and Sappho&#x27;s brother Charaxos. The information about her life recorded in ancient sources was derived from statements in her own poetry that ancient authors assumed were autobiographical, along with local traditions. Some of the ancient traditions about her, such as those about her sexuality and appearance, may derive from ancient Athenian comedy.

Until the 19th century, ancient biographical accounts of archaic poets&#x27; lives were largely accepted as factual. In the 19th century, classicists began to be more sceptical of these traditions, and instead tried to derive biographical information from the poets&#x27; own works. In the latter half of the 20th century, scholars became increasingly sceptical of Greek lyric poetry as a source of autobiographical information, questioning whether the first person narrator in the poems was meant to express the experiences and feelings of the poets. Some scholars, such as Mary Lefkowitz, argue that almost nothing can be known about the lives of early Greek poets such as Sappho; most scholars believe that ancient testimonies about poets&#x27; lives contain some truth but must be treated with caution.

==Life==

Little is known about Sappho&#x27;s life for certain. She was from the island of Lesbos and lived at the end of the seventh and beginning of the sixth centuriesBC. This is the date given by most ancient sources, who considered her a contemporary of the poet Alcaeus and the tyrant Pittacus, both also from Lesbos. She therefore may have been born in the third quarter of the seventh century – Franco Ferrari infers a date of around 650 or 640BC; David Campbell suggests around or before 630BC. Gregory Hutchinson suggests she was active until around 570BC.

Tradition names Sappho&#x27;s mother as Cleïs. This may derive from a now-lost poem or record, though ancient scholars may simply have guessed this name, assuming that Sappho&#x27;s daughter was named Cleïs after her mother. Ancient sources record ten different names for Sappho&#x27;s father; this proliferation of possible names suggests that he was not explicitly named in any of her poetry. The earliest and most commonly attested name for him is Scamandronymus. In Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Heroides&quot;, Sappho&#x27;s father died when she was six. He is not mentioned in any of her surviving works, but Campbell suggests that this detail may have been based on a now-lost poem. Her own name is found in numerous variant spellings; the form that appears in her own extant poetry is ().

Sappho was said to have three brothers: Eurygios, Larichos, and Charaxos. According to Athenaeus, she praised Larichos for being a cupbearer in the town hall of Mytilene, an office held by boys of the best families. This indication that Sappho was born into an aristocratic family is consistent with the sometimes-rarefied environments that her verses record. One ancient tradition tells of a relationship between Charaxos and the Egyptian courtesan Rhodopis. In the fifth century BC Herodotus, the oldest source of the story, reports that Charaxos ransomed Rhodopis for a large sum and that Sappho wrote a poem rebuking him for this. The names of two of the brothers, Charaxos and Larichos, are mentioned in the Brothers Poem, discovered in 2014; the final brother, Eurygios, is mentioned in three ancient sources but nowhere in the extant works of Sappho.

Sappho may have had a daughter named Cleïs, who is referred to in two fragments. Not all scholars accept that Cleïs was Sappho&#x27;s daughter. Fragment 132 describes Cleïs as &quot;&quot;, which, as well as meaning &quot;child&quot;, can also refer to the &quot;youthful beloved in a male homosexual liaison&quot;. It has been suggested that Cleïs was one of her younger lovers, rather than her daughter, though Judith Hallett argues that the description of Cleis as &quot;&quot; (&quot;beloved&quot;) in fragment 132 suggests that Sappho was referring to Cleïs as her daughter, as in other Greek literature the word is used for familial but not sexual relationships.

According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, Sappho was married to Kerkylas of Andros. This name appears to have been invented by a comic poet: the name appears to be a diminutive of the word , a possible meaning of which is &quot;penis&quot;, and which is not otherwise attested as a name, while &quot;Andros&quot;, as well as being the name of a Greek island, is a form of the Greek word , which means &quot;man&quot;. Thus the name, for which an English equivalent could be &quot;Prick (of the isle) of Man&quot;, is likely to have originated from a comic play.

One tradition said that Sappho was exiled from Lesbos around 600BC. The only ancient source for this story is the Parian Chronicle, which records her going into exile in Sicily some time between 604 and 595. This may have been as a result of her family&#x27;s involvement with the conflicts between political elites on Lesbos in this period. It is unknown which side Sappho&#x27;s family took in these conflicts, but most scholars believe that they were in the same faction as her contemporary Alcaeus, who was exiled when Myrsilus took power.

A tradition going back at least to Menander (Fr. 258 K) suggested that Sappho killed herself by jumping off the Leucadian cliffs due to her unrequited love of Phaon, a ferryman. This story is related to two myths about the goddess Aphrodite. In one, Aphrodite rewarded the elderly ferryman Phaon with youth and good looks as a reward for taking her in his ferry without asking for payment; in the other, Aphrodite was cured of her grief at the death of her lover Adonis by throwing herself off the Leucadian cliffs on the advice of Apollo. The story of Sappho&#x27;s leap is regarded as ahistorical by modern scholars, perhaps invented by the comic poets or originating from a misreading of a first-person reference in a non-biographical poem. It was used to reassure ancient audiences of Sappho&#x27;s heterosexuality, and became particularly important in the nineteenth century to writers who saw homosexuality as immoral and wished to construct Sappho as heterosexual.

==Works==

Sappho probably wrote around 10,000 lines of poetry; today, only about 650 survive. She is best known for her lyric poetry, written to be accompanied by music. The &quot;Suda&quot; also attributes to her epigrams, elegiacs, and iambics; three of these epigrams are extant, but are in fact later Hellenistic poems inspired by Sappho. The iambic and elegiac poems attributed to her in the &quot;Suda&quot; may also be later imitations. Ancient authors claim that she primarily wrote love poetry, and the indirect transmission of her work supports this notion. However, the papyrus tradition suggests that this may not have been the case: a series of papyri published in 2014 contains fragments of ten consecutive poems from an ancient edition of Sappho, of which only two are certainly love poems, while at least three and possibly four are primarily concerned with family.

===Ancient editions===
It is uncertain when Sappho&#x27;s poetry was first written down. Some scholars believe that she wrote her own poetry down for future readers; others that if she wrote her works down it was as an aid to reperformance rather than as a work of literature in its own right. In the fifth centuryBC, Athenian book publishers probably began to produce copies of Lesbian lyric poetry, some including explanatory material and glosses as well as the poems themselves. Some time in the second or third centuryBC, Alexandrian scholars produced a critical edition of her poetry. There may have been more than one Alexandrian edition – John J. Winkler argues for two, one edited by Aristophanes of Byzantium and another by his pupil Aristarchus of Samothrace. This is not certain – ancient sources tell us that Aristarchus&#x27; edition of Alcaeus replaced the edition by Aristophanes, but are silent on whether Sappho&#x27;s work also went through multiple editions.

The Alexandrian edition of Sappho&#x27;s poetry may have been based on an Athenian text of her poems, or one from her native Lesbos, and was divided into at least eight books, though the exact number is uncertain. Many modern scholars have followed Denys Page, who conjectured a ninth book in the standard edition; Dimitrios Yatromanolakis doubts this, noting that though ancient sources refer to an eighth book of her poetry, none mention a ninth. The Alexandrian edition of Sappho probably grouped her poems by their metre: ancient sources tell us that each of the first three books contained poems in a single specific metre. Book one of the Alexandrian edition, made up of poems in Sapphic stanzas, seems to have been ordered alphabetically.

Even after the publication of the standard Alexandrian edition, Sappho&#x27;s poetry continued to circulate in other poetry collections. For instance, the Cologne Papyrus on which the Tithonus poem is preserved was part of a Hellenistic anthology of poetry, which contained poetry arranged by theme, rather than by metre and incipit, as it was in the Alexandrian edition.

===Surviving poetry===
The earliest surviving manuscripts of Sappho, including the potsherd on which fragment 2 is preserved, date to the third centuryBC, and thus might predate the Alexandrian edition. The latest surviving copies of her poems transmitted directly from ancient times are written on parchment codex pages from the sixth and seventh centuriesAD, and were surely reproduced from ancient papyri now lost. Manuscript copies of her works may have survived a few centuries longer, but around the ninth century her poetry appears to have disappeared, and by the 12th century, John Tzetzes could write that &quot;the passage of time has destroyed Sappho and her works&quot;.

According to legend, Sappho&#x27;s poetry was lost because the church disapproved of her morals. These legends appear to have originated in the Renaissance – around 1550, Jerome Cardan wrote that Gregory Nazianzen had her work publicly destroyed, and at the end of the 16th century Joseph Justus Scaliger claimed that her works were burned in Rome and Constantinople in 1073 on the orders of Pope Gregory VII.

In reality, Sappho&#x27;s work was probably lost as the demand for it was insufficiently great for it to be copied onto parchment when codices superseded papyrus scrolls as the predominant form of book. A contributing factor to the loss of her poems may have been her Aeolic dialect, considered provincial in a period where the Attic dialect was seen as the true classical Greek, and had become the standard for literary compositions. Consequently, many readers found her dialect difficult to understand: in the second centuryAD, the Roman author Apuleius specifically remarks on its &quot;strangeness&quot;, and several commentaries on the subject demonstrate the difficulties that readers had with it. This was part of a more general decline in interest in the archaic poets; indeed, the surviving papyri suggest that Sappho&#x27;s poetry survived longer than that of her contemporaries such as Alcaeus.

Only approximately 650 lines of Sappho&#x27;s poetry still survive, of which just one poem – the Ode to Aphrodite – is complete, and more than half of the original lines survive in around ten more fragments. Many of the surviving fragments of Sappho contain only a single word – for example, fragment 169A is simply a word meaning &quot;wedding gifts&quot; (, ), and survives as part of a dictionary of rare words. The two major sources of surviving fragments of Sappho are quotations in other ancient works, from a whole poem to as little as a single word, and fragments of papyrus, many of which were rediscovered at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt. Other fragments survive on other materials, including parchment and potsherds. The oldest surviving fragment of Sappho currently known is the Cologne papyrus that contains the Tithonus poem, dating to the third centuryBC.

Until the last quarter of the 19th century, Sappho&#x27;s poetry was known only through quotations in the works of other ancient authors. In 1879, the first new discovery of a fragment of Sappho was made at Fayum. By the end of the 19th century, Bernard Pyne Grenfell and Arthur Surridge Hunt had begun to excavate an ancient rubbish dump at Oxyrhynchus, leading to the discoveries of many previously unknown fragments of Sappho. Fragments of Sappho continue to be rediscovered. Major discoveries were made in 2004 (the &quot;Tithonus poem&quot; and a new, previously unknown fragment) and 2014 (fragments of nine poems: five already known but with new readings, four, including the &quot;Brothers Poem&quot;, not previously known). Additionally, in 2005 a commentary on her poems on a papyrus from the second or third century AD was published.

===Style===

Sappho worked within a well-developed tradition of poetry from Lesbos, which had evolved its own poetic diction, metres, and conventions. Prior to Sappho and her contemporary Alcaeus, Lesbos was associated with poetry and music through the mythical Orpheus and Arion, and through the seventh-centuryBC poet Terpander. The Aeolic metrical tradition in which she composed her poetry was distinct from that of the rest of Greece as its lines always contained a fixed number of syllables – in contrast to other traditions that allowed for the substitution of two short syllables for one long or vice versa.

Sappho was one of the first Greek poets to adopt the &quot;lyric &#x27;I&#x27;&quot; – to write poetry adopting the viewpoint of a specific person, in contrast to the earlier poets Homer and Hesiod, who present themselves more as &quot;conduits of divine inspiration&quot;. Her poetry explores individual identity and personal emotions – desire, jealousy, and love; it also adopts and reinterprets the existing imagery of epic poetry in exploring these themes. Much of her poetry focuses on the lives and experiences of women. Along with the love poetry for which she is best known, her surviving works include poetry focused on the family, epic-influenced narrative, wedding songs, cult hymns, and invective. 

With the exception of a few songs, where the performance context can be deduced from the surviving fragments with some degree of confidence, scholars disagree on how and where Sappho&#x27;s works were performed. They seem to have been composed for a variety of occasions both public and private, and probably encompassed both solo and choral works. Most of her best-preserved fragments, such as the Ode to Aphrodite, are usually thought to be written for solo performance – though some scholars, such as André Lardinois, believe that most or all of her poems were originally composed for choral performances. These works, which Leslie Kurke describes as &quot;private and informal compositions&quot; in contrast to the public ritual nature of cultic hymns and wedding songs, tend to avoid giving details of a specific chronological, geographical, or occasional setting, which Kurke suggests facilitated their reperformance by performers outside Sappho&#x27;s original context.

Sappho&#x27;s poetry is known for its clear language and simple thoughts, sharply-drawn images, and use of direct quotation that brings a sense of immediacy. Unexpected word-play is a characteristic feature of her style. An example is from fragment 96: &quot;now she stands out among Lydian women as after sunset the rose-fingered moon exceeds all stars&quot;, a variation of the Homeric epithet &quot;rosy-fingered Dawn&quot;. Her poetry often uses hyperbole, according to ancient critics &quot;because of its charm&quot;: for example, in fragment 111 she writes that &quot;The groom approaches like Ares [...] Much bigger than a big man&quot;.

Kurke groups Sappho with those archaic Greek poets from what has been called the &quot;élite&quot; ideological tradition, which valued luxury () and high birth. These elite poets tended to identify themselves with the worlds of Greek myths, gods, and heroes, as well as the wealthy East, especially Lydia. Thus in fragment 2 she has Aphrodite &quot;pour into golden cups nectar lavishly mingled with joys&quot;, while in the Tithonus poem she explicitly states that &quot;I love the finer things []&quot;. According to Page duBois, the language, as well as the content, of Sappho&#x27;s poetry evokes an aristocratic sphere. She contrasts Sappho&#x27;s &quot;flowery,[...] adorned&quot; style with the &quot;austere, decorous, restrained&quot; style embodied in the works of later classical authors such as Sophocles, Demosthenes, and Pindar.

===Music===
Sappho&#x27;s poetry was written to be sung, but its musical content is largely uncertain. 
As it is unlikely that any system of musical notation existed in Ancient Greece before the fifth century, the original music that accompanied her songs probably did not survive until the classical period, and no ancient musical scores to accompany her poetry survive. Sappho reportedly wrote in the mixolydian mode, which was considered sorrowful; it was commonly used in Greek tragedy, and Aristoxenus believed that the tragedians learned it from Sappho. Aristoxenus attributed to Sappho the invention of this mode, but this is unlikely. While there are no attestations that she used other modes, she presumably varied them depending on the poem&#x27;s character. When originally sung, each syllable of her text likely corresponded to one note as the use of lengthy melismata developed in the later classical period.

Sappho wrote both songs for solo and choral performance. With Alcaeus, she pioneered a new style of sung monody (single-line melody) that departed from the multi-part choral style that largely defined earlier Greek music. This style afforded her more opportunities to individualize the content of her poems; the historian Plutarch noted that she &quot;speaks words mingled truly with fire, and through her songs, she draws up the heat of her heart&quot;. Some scholars theorize that the Tithonus poem was among her works meant for a solo singer. Only fragments of Sappho&#x27;s choral works are extant; of these, her epithalamia (wedding songs) survive better than her cultic hymns. The later compositions were probably meant for antiphonal performance between either a male and female choir or a soloist and choir.

In Sappho&#x27;s time, sung poetry was usually accompanied by musical instruments, which usually doubled the voice in unison or played homophonically an octave higher or lower. Her poems mention numerous instruments, including the pektis, a harp of Lydian origin, and lyre. Sappho is most closely associated with the barbitos, a lyre-like string instrument that was deep in pitch. Euphorion of Chalcis reports that she referred to it in her poetry, and a fifth-century red-figure vase by either the Dokimasia Painter or Brygos Painter includes Sappho and Alcaeus with barbitoi. Sappho mentions the aulos, a wind instrument with two pipes, in fragment 44 as accompanying the song of the Trojan women at Hector and Andromache&#x27;s wedding, but not as accompanying her own poetry. Later Greek commentators wrongly believed that she had invented the plectrum.

==Social context==

One of the major focuses of scholars studying Sappho has been to attempt to determine the cultural context in which Sappho&#x27;s poems were composed and performed. Various cultural contexts and social roles played by Sappho have been suggested: primarily teacher, priestess, chorus leader, and symposiast. However, the performance contexts of many of Sappho&#x27;s fragments are not easy to determine, and for many more than one possible context is conceivable. 

One longstanding suggestion of a social role for Sappho is that of &quot;Sappho as schoolmistress&quot;. This view, popular in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, was advocated by the German classicist Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, to &quot;explain away Sappho&#x27;s passion for her &#x27;girls and defend her from accusations of homosexuality. More recently the idea has been criticised by historians as anachronistic and has been rejected by several prominent classicists as unjustified by the evidence. In 1959, Denys Page, for example, stated that Sappho&#x27;s extant fragments portray &quot;the loves and jealousies, the pleasures and pains, of Sappho and her companions&quot;; and he adds, &quot;We have found, and shall find, no trace of any formal or official or professional relationship between them... no trace of Sappho the principal of an academy.&quot; Campbell in 1967 judged that Sappho may have &quot;presided over a literary coterie&quot;, but that &quot;evidence for a formal appointment as priestess or teacher is hard to find&quot;. None of Sappho&#x27;s own poetry mentions her teaching, and the earliest source to support the idea of Sappho as a teacher comes from Ovid, six centuries after Sappho&#x27;s lifetime. 
In the second half of the twentieth century, scholars began to interpret Sappho as involved in the ritual education of girls, for instance as a trainer of choruses of girls. Though not all of her poems can be interpreted in this light, Lardinois argues that this is the most plausible social context to site Sappho in. Another interpretation which became popular in the twentieth century was of Sappho as a priestess of Aphrodite. However, though Sappho wrote hymns, including some dedicated to Aphrodite, there is no evidence that she held a priesthood. More recent scholars have proposed that Sappho was part of a circle of women who took part in symposia, for which she composed and performed poetry, or that she wrote her poetry to be performed at men&#x27;s symposia. Though her songs were certainly later performed at symposia, there is no external evidence for archaic Greek women&#x27;s symposia, and even if some of her works were composed for a sympotic context, it is doubtful that the cultic hymns or poems about family would have been.

Despite scholars&#x27; best attempts to find one, Yatromanolakis argues that there is no single performance context to which all of Sappho&#x27;s poems can be attributed. Camillo Neri argues that it is unnecessary to assign all of her poetry to one context, and suggests that she could have composed poetry both in a pedogogic role and as part of a circle of friends.

==Sexuality==

The word &quot;lesbian&quot; is an allusion to Sappho, originating from the name of the island of Lesbos, where she was born. However, though in modern culture Sappho is seen as a lesbian, she has not always been considered so. In classical Athenian comedy (from the Old Comedy of the fifth century to Menander in the late fourth and early third centuriesBC), Sappho was caricatured as a promiscuous heterosexual woman, and the earliest surviving sources to explicitly discuss Sappho&#x27;s homoeroticism come from the Hellenistic period. The earliest of these is a fragmentary biography written on papyrus in the late third or early second centuryBC, which states that Sappho was &quot;accused by some of being irregular in her ways and a woman-lover&quot;. Denys Page comments that the phrase &quot;by some&quot; implies that even the full corpus of Sappho&#x27;s poetry did not provide conclusive evidence of whether she described herself as having sex with women. These ancient authors do not appear to have believed that Sappho did, in fact, have sexual relationships with other women, and as late as the 10th century the &quot;Suda&quot; records that Sappho was &quot;slanderously accused&quot; of having sexual relationships with her &quot;female pupils&quot;.

Among modern scholars, Sappho&#x27;s sexuality is still debated: André Lardinois has described it as the &quot;Great Sappho Question&quot;. Early translators of Sappho sometimes heterosexualised her poetry. Ambrose Philips&#x27; 1711 translation of the Ode to Aphrodite portrayed the object of Sappho&#x27;s desire as male, a reading that was followed by virtually every other translator of the poem until the 20th century, while in 1781 Alessandro Verri interpreted fragment 31 as being about Sappho&#x27;s love for Phaon. Friedrich Gottlieb Welcker argued that Sappho&#x27;s feelings for other women were &quot;entirely idealistic and non-sensual&quot;, while Karl Otfried Müller wrote that fragment 31 described &quot;nothing but a friendly affection&quot;: Glenn Most comments that &quot;one wonders what language Sappho would have used to describe her feelings if they had been ones of sexual excitement&quot;, if this theory were correct. By 1970, the psychoanalyst George Devereux argued that the same poem contained &quot;proof positive of [Sappho&#x27;s] lesbianism&quot;.

Today, it is generally accepted that Sappho&#x27;s poetry portrays homoerotic feelings: as Sandra Boehringer puts it, her works &quot;clearly celebrate eros between women&quot;. Toward the end of the 20th century, though, some scholars began to reject the question of whether Sappho was a lesbian — Glenn Most wrote that Sappho herself &quot;would have had no idea what people mean when they call her nowadays a homosexual&quot;, André Lardinois stated that it is &quot;nonsensical&quot; to ask whether Sappho was a lesbian, and Page duBois calls the question a &quot;particularly obfuscating debate&quot;. Some scholars argue that although Sappho would not have understood modern conceptions of sexuality, lesbianism has always existed and she was fundamentally a lesbian. Others, influenced by Michel Foucault&#x27;s work on the history of sexuality, believe that it is incoherent to project the concept of lesbianism onto an ancient figure like Sappho. Melissa Mueller argues that Sappho&#x27;s poetry can be read as queer even if the question of her lesbianism is undecidable.

==Legacy==
===Ancient reputation===
In antiquity, Sappho&#x27;s poetry was highly admired, and several ancient sources refer to her as the &quot;tenth Muse&quot;. The earliest surviving text to do so is a third-centuryBC epigram by Dioscorides, but poems are preserved in the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot; by Antipater of Sidon and attributed to Plato on the same theme. She was sometimes referred to as &quot;The Poetess&quot;, just as Homer was &quot;The Poet&quot;. The scholars of Alexandria included her in the canon of nine lyric poets. According to Aelian, the Athenian lawmaker and poet Solon asked to be taught a song by Sappho &quot;so that I may learn it and then die&quot;. This story may well be apocryphal, especially as Ammianus Marcellinus tells a similar story about Socrates and a song of Stesichorus, but it is indicative of how highly Sappho&#x27;s poetry was considered in the ancient world.

Sappho&#x27;s poetry also influenced other ancient authors. Plato cites Sappho in his &quot;Phaedrus&quot;, and Socrates&#x27; second speech on love in that dialogue appears to echo Sappho&#x27;s descriptions of the physical effects of desire in fragment 31. Many Hellenistic poets alluded to or adapted Sappho&#x27;s works. The Locrian poet Nossis was described by Marilyn B. Skinner as an imitator of Sappho, and Kathryn Gutzwiller argues that Nossis explicitly positioned herself as an inheritor of Sappho&#x27;s position as a female poet. Several of Theocritus&#x27; poems allude to Sappho, including &quot;Idyll&quot; 28, which imitates both her language and meter. Poems such as Erinna&#x27;s &quot;Distaff&quot; and Callimachus&#x27; &quot;Lock of Berenice&quot; are Sapphic in theme, being concerned with separation – Erinna from her childhood friend; the lock of Berenice&#x27;s hair from Berenice herself. 

In the first centuryBC, the Roman poet Catullus established the themes and metres of Sappho&#x27;s poetry as a part of Latin literature, adopting the Sapphic stanza, believed in antiquity to have been invented by Sappho, giving his lover in his poetry the name &quot;Lesbia&quot; in reference to Sappho, and adapting and translating Sappho&#x27;s 31st fragment in his poem 51. Fragment 31 is widely referenced in Latin literature: as well as by Catullus, it is alluded to by authors including Lucretius in the &quot;De rerum natura&quot;, Plautus in &quot;Miles Gloriosus&quot;, and Virgil in book 12 of the &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Latin poets also referenced other fragments: the section on Eppia in Juvenal&#x27;s sixth satire references fragment 16, a poem in Sapphic stanzas from Statius&#x27; &quot;Silvae&quot; may reference the Ode to Aphrodite, and Horace&#x27;s &quot;Ode&quot; 3.27 alludes to fragment 94.
Other ancient poets wrote about Sappho&#x27;s life. She was a popular character in ancient Athenian comedy, and at least six separate comedies called &quot;Sappho&quot; are known. The earliest known ancient comedy to take Sappho as its main subject was the early-fifth or late-fourth centuryBC &quot;Sappho&quot; by Ameipsias, though nothing is known of it apart from its name. As these comedies survive only in fragments, it is uncertain exactly how they portrayed Sappho, but she was likely characterised as a promiscuous woman. In Diphilos&#x27; play, she was the lover of the poets Anacreon and Hipponax. Sappho was also a favourite subject in the visual arts. She was the most commonly depicted poet on sixth and fifth-century Attic red-figure vase paintings – though unlike male poets such as Anacreon and Alcaeus, in the four surviving vases in which she is identified by an inscription she is never shown singing. She was also shown on coins from Mytilene and Eresos from the first to third centuriesAD, and reportedly depicted in a sculpture by Silanion at Syracuse, statues in Pergamon and Constantinople, and a painting by the Hellenistic artist Leon. 

From the fourth centuryBC, ancient works portray Sappho as a tragic heroine, driven to suicide by her unrequited love for Phaon. A fragment of a play by Menander says that Sappho threw herself off of the cliff at Leucas out of her love for him. Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Heroides&quot; 15 is written as a letter from Sappho to Phaon, and when it was first rediscovered in the 15th century was thought to be a translation of an authentic letter by Sappho. Sappho&#x27;s suicide was also depicted in classical art, for instance on the first-centuryBC Porta Maggiore Basilica in Rome.

While Sappho&#x27;s poetry was admired in the ancient world, her character was not always so well considered. In the Roman period, critics found her lustful and perhaps even homosexual. Horace called her &quot;&quot; (&quot;masculine Sappho&quot;) in his &quot;Epistles&quot;, which the later Porphyrio commented was &quot;either because she is famous for her poetry, in which men more often excel, or because she is maligned for having been a tribad&quot;. By the third centuryAD, the difference between Sappho&#x27;s literary reputation as a poet and her moral reputation as a woman had become so significant that the suggestion that there were in fact two Sapphos began to develop. In his &quot;Historical Miscellanies&quot;, Aelian wrote that there was &quot;another Sappho, a courtesan, not a poetess&quot;.

===Modern reception===

By the medieval period, Sappho&#x27;s works had been lost, though she was still quoted in later authors. Her work became more accessible in the 16th century through printed editions of those authors who had quoted her. In 1508 Aldus Manutius printed an edition of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, which contained Sappho 1, the Ode to Aphrodite, and the first printed edition of Longinus&#x27; &quot;On the Sublime&quot;, complete with his quotation of Sappho 31, appeared in 1554. In 1566, the French printer Robert Estienne produced an edition of the Greek lyric poets that contained around 40 fragments attributed to Sappho.

In 1652, the first English translation of a poem by Sappho was published, in John Hall&#x27;s translation of &quot;On the Sublime&quot;. In 1681 Anne Le Fèvre&#x27;s French edition of Sappho made her work even more widely known. Theodor Bergk&#x27;s 1854 edition became the standard edition of Sappho in the second half of the 19th century; in the first part of the 20th century, the papyrus discoveries of new poems by Sappho led to editions and translations by Edwin Marion Cox and John Maxwell Edmonds, and culminated in the 1955 publication of Edgar Lobel&#x27;s and Denys Page&#x27;s &quot;Poetarum Lesbiorum Fragmenta&quot;.

Like the ancients, modern critics have tended to consider Sappho&#x27;s poetry &quot;extraordinary&quot;. As early as the ninth century, Sappho was referred to as a talented female poet, and in works such as Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;De Claris Mulieribus&quot; and Christine de Pisan&#x27;s &quot;Book of the City of Ladies&quot; she gained a reputation as a learned lady. Even after Sappho&#x27;s works had been lost, the Sapphic stanza continued to be used in medieval lyric poetry, and with the rediscovery of her work in the Renaissance, she began to increasingly influence European poetry. In the 16th century, members of La Pléiade, a circle of French poets, were influenced by her to experiment with Sapphic stanzas and with writing love-poetry with a first-person female voice. 
From the Romantic era, Sappho&#x27;s work – especially her Ode to Aphrodite – has been a key influence of conceptions of what lyric poetry should be. Poets such as Alfred Lord Tennyson in the 19th century, and A. E. Housman in the 20th century, have been influenced by her poetry. Tennyson based poems including &quot;Eleanore&quot; and &quot;Fatima&quot; on Sappho&#x27;s fragment 31, while three of Housman&#x27;s works are adaptations of the Midnight Poem, long thought to be by Sappho though the authorship is now disputed. At the beginning of the 20th century, the Imagists – especially Ezra Pound, H. D., and Richard Aldington – were influenced by Sappho&#x27;s fragments; a number of Pound&#x27;s poems in his early collection &quot;Lustra&quot; were adaptations of Sapphic poems, while H. D.&#x27;s poetry frequently echoed Sappho stylistically and thematically, and in some cases, such as &quot;Fragment 40&quot;, more specifically invoke Sappho&#x27;s writing. 

Western classical composers have also been inspired by Sappho. The story of Sappho and Phaon began to appear in opera in the late 18th century, for example in Simon Mayr&#x27;s &quot;Saffo&quot;; in the 19th century Charles Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Sapho&quot; and Giovanni Pacini&#x27;s &quot;Saffo&quot; portrayed a Sappho involved in political revolts. In the 20th century, Peggy Glanville-Hicks&#x27; opera &quot;Sappho&quot; was based on the play by Lawrence Durrell. Instrumental works inspired by Sappho include &quot;Chant sapphique&quot; by Camille Saint-Saëns, and the percussion piece &quot;Psappha&quot; by Iannis Xenakis. Composers have also set Sappho&#x27;s own poetry to music: for example Xenakis&#x27; &quot;Aïs&quot;, which uses text from fragment 95, and &quot;Charaxos, Eos and Tithonos&quot; (2014) by Theodore Antoniou, based on the 2014 discoveries.

It was not long after the rediscovery of Sappho that her sexuality once again became the focus of critical attention. In the early 17th century, John Donne wrote &quot;Sapho to Philaenis&quot;, returning to the idea of Sappho as a hypersexual lover of women. The modern debate on Sappho&#x27;s sexuality began in the 19th century, with Welcker publishing, in 1816, an article defending Sappho from charges of prostitution and lesbianism, arguing that she was chaste – a position that was later taken up by Wilamowitz at the end of the 19th and Henry Thornton Wharton at the beginning of the 20th centuries. In the 19th century Sappho was co-opted by Charles Baudelaire in France and later Algernon Charles Swinburne in England for the Decadent Movement. The critic Douglas Bush characterised Swinburne&#x27;s sadomasochistic Sappho as &quot;one of the daughters of de Sade&quot;, the French author known for his violent pornographic books. By the late 19th century, lesbian writers such as Michael Field and Amy Levy became interested in Sappho for her sexuality, and by the turn of the 20th century she was considered a &quot;patron saint of lesbians&quot;.

From the beginning of the 19th century, women poets such as Felicia Hemans (&quot;The Last Song of Sappho&quot;) and Letitia Elizabeth Landon (&quot;Sketch the First. Sappho&quot;, and in &quot;Ideal Likenesses&quot;) took Sappho as one of their progenitors. Sappho also began to be regarded as a role model for campaigners for women&#x27;s rights, beginning with works such as Caroline Norton&#x27;s &quot;The Picture of Sappho&quot;. Later in that century, she became a model for the so-called New Woman – independent and educated women who desired social and sexual autonomy – and by the 1960s, the feminist Sappho was – along with the hypersexual, often but not exclusively lesbian Sappho – one of the two most important cultural perceptions of her. 

The discoveries of new poems by Sappho in 2004 and 2014 excited both scholarly and media attention. The announcement of the Tithonus poem was the subject of international news coverage, and was described by Marilyn Skinner as &quot;the &quot;&quot; of a lifetime&quot;. The publication of the Brothers Poem a decade later saw further news coverage and discussion on social media, while M. L. West described the 2014 discoveries as &quot;the greatest for 92 years&quot;.

<text>Simon bar Kokhba ( ) or Simon bar Koseba ( ), commonly referred to simply as Bar Kokhba, was a Jewish military leader in Judea. He lent his name to the Bar Kokhba revolt, which he initiated against the Roman Empire in 132 CE. Though they were ultimately unsuccessful, Bar Kokhba and his rebels did manage to establish and maintain a Jewish state for about three years after beginning the rebellion. Bar Kokhba served as the state&#x27;s leader, crowning himself as &quot;nasi&quot; (). Some of the rabbinic scholars in his time imagined him to be the long-expected Messiah of Judaism. In 135, Bar Kokhba was killed by Roman troops in the fortified town of Betar. The Judean rebels who remained after his death were all killed or enslaved within the next year, and their defeat was followed by a harsh crackdown on the Judean populace by the Roman emperor Hadrian.

==Name ==
===Documented name===
Documents discovered in the 20th century in the Cave of Letters give his original name, with variations: Simeon bar Kosevah (), Bar Kosevaʾ‎ () or Ben Kosevaʾ‎ (). It is probable that his original name was Bar Koseba. The name may indicate that his father or his place of origin was named Koseva(h), with Khirbet Kuwayzibah being a likely nominee for identification; Others, namely Emil Schürer, think the surname may have been an indication of his place of birth, in the village known as Chozeba (maybe Chezib) but might as well be a general family name.

===Nicknames===
During the revolt, the Jewish sage Rabbi Akiva regarded Simon as the Jewish messiah; the Talmud records his statement that the Star Prophecy verse from Numbers 24:17: &quot;There shall come a star out of Jacob,&quot; referred to him, based on identification of the Hebrew word for star, &quot;kokhav&quot;, and his name, &quot;bar Kozeva.&quot; The name Bar Kokhba, which references this statement of Akiva, does not appear in the Talmud, but only in ecclesiastical sources, until the 16th century. The Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Taanit&quot; 4:5) and the Babylonian Talmud (&quot;Sanhedrin&quot; 93b and 97b) mention him by the name of Bar Kozeva.

==Revolt leader==

===Background===
Despite the devastation wrought by the Romans during the First Jewish–Roman War (66–73 CE), which left the population and countryside in ruins, a series of laws passed by Roman Emperors provided the incentive for the second rebellion. Based on the delineation of years in Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Chronicon&quot; (whose Latin translation is known as the Chronicle of Jerome) the Jewish revolt began under the Roman governor Tineius (Tynius) Rufus in the 16th year of Hadrian&#x27;s reign, or what was equivalent to the 4th year of the 227th Olympiad. Hadrian sent an army to crush the resistance, but it faced a strong opponent, since Bar Kokhba, as the recognised leader of Israel, punished any Jew who refused to join his ranks. Two and a half years later, after the war had ended, the Roman emperor Hadrian barred Jews from entering Aelia Capitolina, the pagan city he had built on the ruins of Jewish Jerusalem. The name Aelia was derived from one of the emperor&#x27;s names, Aelius. According to Philostorgius, this was done so that its former Jewish inhabitants &quot;might not find in the name of the city a pretext for claiming it as their country.&quot;

===Overview===
For many Jews of the time, this turn of events was heralded as the long hoped for Messianic Age. The Romans fared very poorly during the initial revolt facing a unified Jewish force, in contrast to the First Jewish–Roman War, where Flavius Josephus records three separate Jewish armies fighting each other for control of the Temple Mount during the three weeks after the Romans had breached Jerusalem&#x27;s walls and were fighting their way to the center. Being outnumbered and taking heavy casualties, the Romans adopted a scorched earth policy which reduced and demoralised the Judean populace, slowly grinding away at the will of the Judeans to sustain the war.

During the final phase of the war, Bar Kokhba took up refuge in the fortress of Betar. The Romans eventually captured it after laying siege to the city.

The Jerusalem Talmud makes several claims considered as non-historical by modern scholarship. One such claim is that the duration of the siege was of three and half years, although the war itself lasted, according to the same author, two and half years. Another part of the Talmudic narrative is that the Romans killed all the defenders except for one Jewish youth, Simeon ben Gamliel II, whose life was spared. According to Cassius Dio, 580,000 Jews were killed in overall war operations across the country, and some 50 fortified towns and 985 villages razed to the ground, while the number of those who perished by famine, disease and fire was beyond finding out.

===Outcome and aftermath===
So costly was the Roman victory, that the Emperor Hadrian, when reporting to the Roman Senate, did not see fit to begin with the customary greeting &quot;If you and your children are healthy, it is well; I and the legions are healthy.&quot;

In the aftermath of the war, Hadrian consolidated the older political units of Judaea, Galilee and Samaria into the new province of Syria Palaestina, which is commonly interpreted as an attempt to complete the disassociation with Judaea.

==Archaeological findings==
In the late 20th and 21st century, new information about the revolt has come to light, from the discovery of several collections of letters, some possibly by Bar Kokhba himself, in the Cave of Letters overlooking the Dead Sea. These letters can now be seen at the Israel Museum.

In March 2024, a coin bearing the inscription &quot;Eleazar the Priest&quot; was found along with &quot;Year 1 of the Redemption of Israel&quot; on the bottom.

==Ideology and language==
According to Israeli archaeologist Yigael Yadin, Bar Kokhba tried to revive Hebrew and make Hebrew the official language of the Jews as part of his messianic ideology. In &quot;A Roadmap to the Heavens: An Anthropological Study of Hegemony among Priests, Sages, and Laymen (Judaism and Jewish Life)&quot; by Sigalit Ben-Zion (page 155), Yadin remarked: &quot;it seems that this change came as a result of the order that was given by Bar Kokhba, who wanted to revive the Hebrew language and make it the official language of the state.&quot;

==Character==
===Talmud===
Simon bar Kokhba is portrayed in rabbinic literature as being somewhat irrational and irascible in conduct. The Talmud says that he presided over an army of Jewish insurgents numbering some 200,000, but had compelled its young recruits to prove their valor by each man chopping off one of his own fingers. The Sages of Israel complained to him why he marred the people of Israel with such blemishes. Whenever he would go forth into battle, he was reported as saying: &quot;O Master of the universe, there is no need for you to assist us [against our enemies], but do not embarrass us either!&quot; It is also said of him that he killed his maternal uncle, Rabbi Elazar Hamudaʻi, after suspecting him of collaborating with the enemy, thereby forfeiting Divine protection, which led to the destruction of Betar in which Bar Kokhba himself also perished.

Hadrian is thought to have personally supervised the closing military operations in the siege against Betar. When the Roman army eventually took the city, soldiers carried Bar Kokhba&#x27;s severed head to Hadrian, and when Hadrian asked who it was that killed him, a Samaritan replied that he had killed him. When Hadrian requested that they bring the severed head (Greek: &quot;protome&quot;) of the slain victim close to him that he might see it, Hadrian observed that a serpent was wrapped around the head. Hadrian then replied: &quot;Had it not been for God who killed him, who would have been able to kill him!?&quot;

===Eusebius===
Bar Kokhba was a ruthless leader, punishing any Jew who refused to join his ranks. According to Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Chronicon&quot;, he severely punished the Christians with death by different means of torture for their refusal to fight against the Romans.

==In popular culture==

Since the end of the nineteenth century, Bar-Kochba has been the subject of numerous works of art (dramas, operas, novels, etc.), including:
* (1858), a Hebrew novel by Kalman Schulman
* &quot;Bar Kokhba&quot; (1882), a Yiddish operetta by Abraham Goldfaden (mus. and libr.). The work was written in the wake of pogroms against Jews following the 1881 assassination of Czar Alexander II of Russia.

Another operetta on the subject of Bar Kokhba was written by the Russian-Jewish emigre composer Yaacov Bilansky Levanon in Palestine in the 1920s.

John Zorn&#x27;s Masada Chamber Ensemble recorded an album called &quot;Bar Kokhba&quot;, showing a photograph of the Letter of Bar Kokhba to Yeshua, son of Galgola on the cover.

===The Bar Kokhba game===

According to a legend, during his reign, Bar Kokhba was once presented a mutilated man, who had his tongue ripped out and hands cut off. Unable to talk or write, the victim was incapable of telling who his attackers were. Thus, Bar Kokhba decided to ask simple questions to which the dying man was able to nod or shake his head with his last movements; the murderers were consequently apprehended.

In Hungary, this legend spawned the &quot;Bar Kokhba game&quot;, in which one of two players comes up with a word or object, while the other must figure it out by asking questions only to be answered with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. The questioner usually asks first if it is a living being, if not, if it is an object, if not, it is surely an abstraction. The verb &quot;kibarkochbázni&quot; (&quot;to Bar Kochba out&quot;) became a common language verb meaning &quot;retrieving information in an extremely tedious way&quot;.

<doc id="27790" wikidata="Q41112" url="?curid=27790" title="Schizophrenia">
<text>Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized variously by hallucinations (typically, hearing voices), delusions, disorganized thinking and behavior, and flat or inappropriate affect. Symptoms develop gradually and typically begin during young adulthood and are never resolved. There is no objective diagnostic test; diagnosis is based on observed behavior, a psychiatric history that includes the person&#x27;s reported experiences, and reports of others familiar with the person. For a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the described symptoms need to have been present for at least six months (according to the DSM-5) or one month (according to the ICD-11). Many people with schizophrenia have other mental disorders, especially mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders, as well as obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD).
About 0.3% to 0.7% of people are diagnosed with schizophrenia during their lifetime. In 2017, there were an estimated 1.1 million new cases and in 2022 a total of 24 million cases globally. Males are more often affected and on average have an earlier onset than females. The causes of schizophrenia may include genetic and environmental factors. Genetic factors include a variety of common and rare genetic variants. Possible environmental factors include being raised in a city, childhood adversity, cannabis use during adolescence, infections, the age of a person&#x27;s mother or father, and poor nutrition during pregnancy.
About half of those diagnosed with schizophrenia will have a significant improvement over the long term with no further relapses, and a small proportion of these will recover completely. The other half will have a lifelong impairment. In severe cases, people may be admitted to hospitals. Social problems such as long-term unemployment, poverty, homelessness, exploitation, and victimization are commonly correlated with schizophrenia. Compared to the general population, people with schizophrenia have a higher suicide rate (about 5% overall) and more physical health problems, leading to an average decrease in life expectancy by 20 to 28 years. In 2015, an estimated 17,000 deaths were linked to schizophrenia.
The mainstay of treatment is antipsychotic medication, including olanzapine and risperidone, along with counseling, job training, and social rehabilitation. Up to a third of people do not respond to initial antipsychotics, in which case clozapine is offered. In a network comparative meta-analysis of 15 antipsychotic drugs, clozapine was significantly more effective than all other drugs, although clozapine&#x27;s heavily multimodal action may cause more significant side effects. In situations where doctors judge that there is a risk of harm to self or others, they may impose short involuntary hospitalization. Long-term hospitalization is used on a small number of people with severe schizophrenia. In some countries where supportive services are limited or unavailable, long-term hospital stays are more common.
==Signs and symptoms==
Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by significant alterations in perception, thoughts, mood, and behavior. Symptoms are described in terms of positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms. The positive symptoms of schizophrenia are the same for any psychosis and are sometimes referred to as psychotic symptoms. These may be present in any of the different psychoses and are often transient, making early diagnosis of schizophrenia problematic. Psychosis noted for the first time in a person who is later diagnosed with schizophrenia is referred to as a first-episode psychosis (FEP).

===Positive symptoms===
Positive symptoms are those symptoms that are not normally experienced, but are present in people during a psychotic episode in schizophrenia, including delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized thoughts, speech and behavior or inappropriate affect, typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Hallucinations occur at some point in the lifetimes of 80% of those with schizophrenia and most commonly involve the sense of hearing (most often hearing voices), but can sometimes involve any of the other senses such as taste, sight, smell, and touch. The frequency of hallucinations involving multiple senses is double the rate of those involving only one sense. They are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme. Delusions are bizarre or persecutory in nature. Distortions of self-experience such as feeling that others can hear one&#x27;s thoughts (thought broadcasting delusion) or that thoughts are being inserted into one&#x27;s mind, sometimes termed passivity phenomena, are also common. Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication and become reduced over the course of the illness, perhaps linked to the age-related decline in dopamine activity.

===Negative symptoms===
Negative symptoms are deficits of normal emotional responses, or of other thought processes. The five recognized domains of negative symptoms are: blunted affect – showing flat expressions (monotone) or little emotion; alogia – a poverty of speech; anhedonia – an inability to feel pleasure; asociality – the lack of desire to form relationships, and avolition – a lack of motivation and apathy. Avolition and anhedonia are seen as motivational deficits resulting from impaired reward processing. Reward is the main driver of motivation and this is mostly mediated by dopamine. It has been suggested that negative symptoms are multidimensional and they have been categorised into two subdomains of apathy or lack of motivation, and diminished expression. Apathy includes avolition, anhedonia, and social withdrawal; diminished expression includes blunt affect and alogia. Sometimes diminished expression is treated as both verbal and non-verbal.

Apathy accounts for around 50% of the most often found negative symptoms and affects functional outcome and subsequent quality of life. Apathy is related to disrupted cognitive processing affecting memory and planning, including goal-directed behaviour. The two subdomains have suggested a need for separate treatment approaches. A lack of distress is another noted negative symptom. A distinction is often made between those negative symptoms that are inherent to schizophrenia, termed primary; and those that result from positive symptoms, from the side effects of antipsychotics, substance use disorder, and social deprivation, termed secondary negative symptoms. Negative symptoms are less responsive to medication and the most difficult to treat. However, if properly assessed, secondary negative symptoms are amenable to treatment. There is some evidence that the negative symptoms of schizophrenia are amenable to psychostimulant medication, although such drugs have varying degrees of risk for causing positive psychotic symptoms.

Scales for specifically assessing the presence of negative symptoms, and for measuring their severity, and their changes have been introduced since the earlier scales such as the PANNS that deals with all types of symptoms. These scales are the &quot;Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms&quot; (CAINS), and the &quot;Brief Negative Symptom Scale&quot; (BNSS) also known as second-generation scales. In 2020, ten years after its introduction, a cross-cultural study of the use of BNSS found valid and reliable psychometric evidence for its five-domain structure cross-culturally. The BNSS can assess both the presence and severity of negative symptoms of the five recognized domains and an additional item of reduced normal distress. It has been used to measure changes in negative symptoms in trials of psychosocial and pharmacological interventions.

===Cognitive symptoms===
An estimated 70% of those with schizophrenia have cognitive deficits, and these are most pronounced in early-onset and late-onset illness. These are often evident long before the onset of illness in the prodromal stage, and may be present in childhood or early adolescence. They are a core feature but not considered to be core symptoms, as are positive and negative symptoms. However, their presence and degree of dysfunction is taken as a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of core symptoms. Cognitive deficits become worse at first episode psychosis but then return to baseline, and remain fairly stable over the course of the illness.

The deficits in cognition are seen to drive the negative psychosocial outcome in schizophrenia, and are claimed to equate to a possible reduction in IQ from the norm of 100 to 70–85. Cognitive deficits may be of neurocognition (nonsocial) or of social cognition. Neurocognition is the ability to receive and remember information, and includes verbal fluency, memory, reasoning, problem solving, speed of processing, and auditory and visual perception. Verbal memory and attention are seen to be the most affected. Verbal memory impairment is associated with a decreased level of semantic processing (relating meaning to words). Another memory impairment is that of episodic memory. An impairment in visual perception that is consistently found in schizophrenia is that of visual backward masking. Visual processing impairments include an inability to perceive complex visual illusions. Social cognition is concerned with the mental operations needed to interpret, and understand the self and others in the social world. This is also an associated impairment, and facial emotion perception is often found to be difficult. Facial perception is critical for ordinary social interaction. Cognitive impairments do not usually respond to antipsychotics, and there are a number of interventions that are used to try to improve them; cognitive remediation therapy is of particular help.

Neurological soft signs of clumsiness and loss of fine motor movement are often found in schizophrenia, which may resolve with effective treatment of FEP.

===Onset===
Onset typically occurs between the late teens and early 30s, with the peak incidence occurring in males in the early to mid-twenties, and in females in the late twenties. Onset before the age of 17 is known as early-onset, and before the age of 13, as can sometimes occur, is known as childhood schizophrenia or very early-onset. Onset can occur between the ages of 40 and 60, known as late-onset schizophrenia. Onset over the age of 60, which may be difficult to differentiate as schizophrenia, is known as very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis. Late onset has shown that a higher rate of females are affected; they have less severe symptoms and need lower doses of antipsychotics. The tendency for earlier onset in males is later seen to be balanced by a post-menopausal increase in the development in females. Estrogen produced pre-menopause has a dampening effect on dopamine receptors but its protection can be overridden by a genetic overload. There has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of older adults with schizophrenia.

Onset may happen suddenly or may occur after the slow and gradual development of a number of signs and symptoms, a period known as the prodromal stage. Up to 75% of those with schizophrenia go through a prodromal stage. The negative and cognitive symptoms in the prodrome stage can precede FEP (first episode psychosis) by many months and up to five years. The period from FEP and treatment is known as the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) which is seen to be a factor in functional outcome. The prodromal stage is the high-risk stage for the development of psychosis. Since the progression to first episode psychosis is not inevitable, an alternative term is often preferred of at risk mental state. Cognitive dysfunction at an early age impacts a young person&#x27;s usual cognitive development. Recognition and early intervention at the prodromal stage would minimize the associated disruption to educational and social development and has been the focus of many studies.

==Risk factors==

Schizophrenia is described as a neurodevelopmental disorder with no precise boundary, or single cause, and is thought to develop from gene–environment interactions with involved vulnerability factors. The interactions of these risk factors are complex, as numerous and diverse insults from conception to adulthood can be involved. A genetic predisposition on its own, without interacting environmental factors, will not give rise to the development of schizophrenia. The genetic component means that prenatal brain development is disturbed, and environmental influence affects the postnatal development of the brain. Evidence suggests that genetically susceptible children are more likely to be vulnerable to the effects of environmental risk factors.

===Genetic===
Estimates of the heritability of schizophrenia are between 70% and 80%, which implies that 70% to 80% of the individual differences in risk of schizophrenia are associated with genetics. These estimates vary because of the difficulty in separating genetic and environmental influences, and their accuracy has been queried. The greatest risk factor for developing schizophrenia is having a first-degree relative with the disease (risk is 6.5%); more than 40% of identical twins of those with schizophrenia are also affected. If one parent is affected the risk is about 13% and if both are affected the risk is nearly 50%. However, the &quot;DSM-5&quot; indicates that most people with schizophrenia have no family history of psychosis. Results of candidate gene studies of schizophrenia have generally failed to find consistent associations, and the genetic loci identified by genome-wide association studies explain only a small fraction of the variation in the disease.

Many genes are known to be involved in schizophrenia, each with small effects and unknown transmission and expression. The summation of these effect sizes into a polygenic risk score can explain at least 7% of the variability in liability for schizophrenia. Around 5% of cases of schizophrenia are understood to be at least partially attributable to rare copy number variations (CNVs); these structural variations are associated with known genomic disorders involving deletions at 22q11.2 (DiGeorge syndrome) and 17q12 (17q12 microdeletion syndrome), duplications at 16p11.2 (most frequently found) and deletions at 15q11.2 (Burnside–Butler syndrome). Some of these CNVs increase the risk of developing schizophrenia by as much as 20-fold, and are frequently comorbid with autism and intellectual disabilities.

The genes CRHR1 and CRHBP are associated with the severity of suicidal behavior. These genes code for stress response proteins needed in the control of the HPA axis, and their interaction can affect this axis. Response to stress can cause lasting changes in the function of the HPA axis possibly disrupting the negative feedback mechanism, homeostasis, and the regulation of emotion leading to altered behaviors.

The question of how schizophrenia could be primarily genetically influenced, given that people with schizophrenia have lower fertility rates, is a paradox. It is expected that genetic variants that increase the risk of schizophrenia would be selected against, due to their negative effects on reproductive fitness. A number of potential explanations have been proposed, including that alleles associated with schizophrenia risk confers a fitness advantage in unaffected individuals. While some evidence has not supported this idea, others propose that a large number of alleles each contributing a small amount can persist.

A meta-analysis found that oxidative DNA damage was significantly increased in schizophrenia.

===Environmental===
Environmental factors, each associated with a slight risk of developing schizophrenia in later life include oxygen deprivation, infection, prenatal maternal stress, and malnutrition in the mother during prenatal development. A risk is associated with maternal obesity, in increasing oxidative stress, and dysregulating the dopamine and serotonin pathways. Both maternal stress and infection have been demonstrated to alter fetal neurodevelopment through an increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines. There is a slighter risk associated with being born in the winter or spring possibly due to vitamin D deficiency or a prenatal viral infection. Other infections during pregnancy or around the time of birth that have been linked to an increased risk include infections by &quot;Toxoplasma gondii&quot; and &quot;Chlamydia&quot;. The increased risk is about five to eight percent. Viral infections of the brain during childhood are also linked to a risk of schizophrenia during adulthood. Cat exposure is also associated with an increased risk of broadly defined schizophrenia-related disorders, with an odds ratio of 2.4.

Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), severe forms of which are classed as childhood trauma, range from being bullied or abused, to the death of a parent. Many adverse childhood experiences can cause toxic stress and increase the risk of psychosis. Chronic trauma, including ACEs, can promote lasting inflammatory dysregulation throughout the nervous system. It is suggested that early stress may contribute to the development of schizophrenia through these alterations in the immune system. Schizophrenia was the last diagnosis to benefit from the link made between ACEs and adult mental health outcomes.

Living in an urban environment during childhood or as an adult has consistently been found to increase the risk of schizophrenia by a factor of two, even after taking into account drug use, ethnic group, and size of social group. A possible link between the urban environment and pollution has been suggested to be the cause of the elevated risk of schizophrenia. Other risk factors include social isolation, immigration related to social adversity and racial discrimination, family dysfunction, unemployment, and poor housing conditions. Having a father older than 40 years, or parents younger than 20 years are also associated with schizophrenia.

====Substance use====
About half of those with schizophrenia use recreational drugs including alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis excessively. Use of stimulants such as amphetamine and cocaine can lead to a temporary stimulant psychosis, which presents very similarly to schizophrenia. Rarely, alcohol use can also result in a similar alcohol-related psychosis. Drugs may also be used as coping mechanisms by people who have schizophrenia, to deal with depression, anxiety, boredom, and loneliness. The use of cannabis and tobacco are not associated with the development of cognitive deficits, and sometimes a reverse relationship is found where their use improves these symptoms. However, substance use disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicide, and a poor response to treatment.

Cannabis use may be a contributory factor in the development of schizophrenia, potentially increasing the risk of the disease in those who are already at risk. The increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual. Its use is associated with doubling the rate.

==Causes==

The causes of schizophrenia are still unknown. Several models have been put forward to explain the link between altered brain function and schizophrenia. The prevailing model of schizophrenia is that of a neurodevelopmental disorder, and the underlying changes that occur before symptoms become evident are seen as arising from the interaction between genes and the environment. Extensive studies support this model. Maternal infections, malnutrition and complications during pregnancy and childbirth are known risk factors for the development of schizophrenia, which usually emerges between the ages of 18 and 25, a period that overlaps with certain stages of neurodevelopment. Gene-environment interactions lead to deficits in the neural circuitry that affect sensory and cognitive functions.

The common dopamine and glutamate models proposed are not mutually exclusive; each is seen to have a role in the neurobiology of schizophrenia. The most common model put forward was the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia, which attributes psychosis to the mind&#x27;s faulty interpretation of the misfiring of dopaminergic neurons. This has been directly related to the symptoms of delusions and hallucinations. Abnormal dopamine signaling has been implicated in schizophrenia based on the usefulness of medications that affect the dopamine receptor and the observation that dopamine levels are increased during acute psychosis. A decrease in D1 receptors in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may also be responsible for deficits in working memory.

The glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia links alterations between glutamatergic neurotransmission and the neural oscillations that affect connections between the thalamus and the cortex. Studies have shown that a reduced expression of a glutamate receptor – NMDA receptor, and glutamate blocking drugs such as phencyclidine and ketamine can mimic the symptoms and cognitive problems associated with schizophrenia. Post-mortem studies consistently find that a subset of these neurons fail to express GAD67 (GAD1), in addition to abnormalities in brain morphometry. The subsets of interneurons that are abnormal in schizophrenia are responsible for the synchronizing of neural ensembles needed during working memory tasks. These give the neural oscillations produced as gamma waves that have a frequency of between 30 and 80 hertz. Both working memory tasks and gamma waves are impaired in schizophrenia, which may reflect abnormal interneuron functionality. An important process that may be disrupted in neurodevelopment is astrogenesis – the formation of astrocytes. Astrocytes are crucial in contributing to the formation and maintenance of neural circuits and it is believed that disruption in this role can result in a number of neurodevelopmental disorders including schizophrenia. Evidence suggests that reduced numbers of astrocytes in deeper cortical layers are assocociated with a diminished expression of EAAT2, a glutamate transporter in astrocytes; supporting the glutamate hypothesis.

Deficits in executive functions, such as planning, inhibition, and working memory, are pervasive in schizophrenia. Although these functions are separable, their dysfunction in schizophrenia may reflect an underlying deficit in the ability to represent goal related information in working memory, and to use this to direct cognition and behavior. These impairments have been linked to a number of neuroimaging and neuropathological abnormalities. For example, functional neuroimaging studies report evidence of reduced neural processing efficiency, whereby the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is activated to a greater degree to achieve a certain level of performance relative to controls on working memory tasks. These abnormalities may be linked to the consistent post-mortem finding of reduced neuropil, evidenced by increased pyramidal cell density and reduced dendritic spine density. These cellular and functional abnormalities may also be reflected in structural neuroimaging studies that find reduced grey matter volume in association with deficits in working memory tasks.

Positive symptoms have been linked to cortical thinning in the superior temporal gyrus. The severity of negative symptoms has been linked to reduced thickness in the left medial orbitofrontal cortex. Anhedonia, traditionally defined as a reduced capacity to experience pleasure, is frequently reported in schizophrenia. However, a large body of evidence suggests that hedonic responses are intact in schizophrenia, and that what is reported to be anhedonia is a reflection of dysfunction in other processes related to reward. Overall, a failure of reward prediction is thought to lead to impairment in the generation of cognition and behavior required to obtain rewards, despite normal hedonic responses.

Another theory links abnormal brain lateralization to the development of being left-handed which is significantly more common in those with schizophrenia. This abnormal development of hemispheric asymmetry is noted in schizophrenia. Studies have concluded that the link is a true and verifiable effect that may reflect a genetic link between lateralization and schizophrenia.

Bayesian models of brain functioning have been used to link abnormalities in cellular functioning to symptoms. Both hallucinations and delusions have been suggested to reflect improper encoding of prior expectations, thereby causing expectation to excessively influence sensory perception and the formation of beliefs. In approved models of circuits that mediate predictive coding, reduced NMDA receptor activation, could in theory result in the positive symptoms of delusions and hallucinations.

==Diagnosis==
===Criteria===
Schizophrenia is diagnosed based on criteria in either the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot; (DSM) published by the American Psychiatric Association or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD) published by the World Health Organization (WHO). These criteria use the self-reported experiences of the person and reported abnormalities in behavior, followed by a psychiatric assessment. The mental status examination is an important part of the assessment. An established tool for assessing the severity of positive and negative symptoms is the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). This has been seen to have shortcomings relating to negative symptoms, and other scales – the &quot;Clinical Assessment Interview for Negative Symptoms&quot; (CAINS), and the &quot;Brief Negative Symptoms Scale&quot; (BNSS) have been introduced. The DSM-5, published in 2013, gives a &quot;Scale to Assess the Severity of Symptom Dimensions&quot; outlining eight dimensions of symptoms.

DSM-5 states that to be diagnosed with schizophrenia, two diagnostic criteria have to be met over the period of one month, with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months. One of the symptoms needs to be either delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be one of the negative symptoms, or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour. A different diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder can be made before the six months needed for the diagnosis of schizophrenia.

In Australia, the guideline for diagnosis is for six months or more with symptoms severe enough to affect ordinary functioning. In the UK diagnosis is based on having the symptoms for most of the time for one month, with symptoms that significantly affect the ability to work, study, or carry on ordinary daily living, and with other similar conditions ruled out.

The ICD criteria are typically used in European countries; the DSM criteria are used predominantly in the United States and Canada, and are prevailing in research studies. In practice, agreement between the two systems is high. The current proposal for the ICD-11 criteria for schizophrenia recommends adding self-disorder as a symptom.

A major unresolved difference between the two diagnostic systems is that of the requirement in DSM of an impaired functional outcome. WHO for ICD argues that not all people with schizophrenia have functional deficits and so these are not specific for the diagnosis.

=== Neuroimaging techniques ===
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become a tool in understanding brain activity and connectivity differences in individuals with schizophrenia. Through resting-state fMRI, researchers have observed altered connectivity patterns within several key brain networks, such as the default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN), and central executive network (CEN). Alterations may underlie cognitive and emotional symptoms in schizophrenia, such as disorganized thinking, impaired attention, and emotional dysregulation.

===Comorbidities===

Many people with schizophrenia may have one or more other mental disorders, such as anxiety disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder, or substance use disorder. These are separate disorders that require treatment. When comorbid with schizophrenia, substance use disorder and antisocial personality disorder both increase the risk for violence. Comorbid substance use disorder also increases the risk of suicide.

Sleep disorders often co-occur with schizophrenia, and may be an early sign of relapse. Sleep disorders are linked with positive symptoms such as disorganized thinking and can adversely affect cortical plasticity and cognition. The consolidation of memories is disrupted in sleep disorders. They are associated with severity of illness, a poor prognosis, and poor quality of life. Sleep onset and maintenance insomnia is a common symptom, regardless of whether treatment has been received or not. Genetic variations have been found associated with these conditions involving the circadian rhythm, dopamine and histamine metabolism, and signal transduction.

Schizophrenia is also associated with a number of somatic comorbidities including diabetes mellitus type 2, autoimmune diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. The association of these with schizophrenia may be partially due to medications (e.g. dyslipidemia from antipsychotics), environmental factors (e.g. complications from an increased rate of cigarette smoking), or associated with the disorder itself (e.g. diabetes mellitus type 2 and some cardiovascular diseases are thought to be genetically linked). These somatic comorbidities contribute to reduced life expectancy among persons with the disorder.

===Differential diagnosis===

To make a diagnosis of schizophrenia other possible causes of psychosis need to be excluded. Psychotic symptoms lasting less than a month may be diagnosed as brief psychotic disorder, or as schizophreniform disorder. Psychosis is noted in &quot;Other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders&quot; as a DSM-5 category. Schizoaffective disorder is diagnosed if symptoms of mood disorder are substantially present alongside psychotic symptoms. Psychosis that results from a general medical condition or substance is termed secondary psychosis.

Psychotic symptoms may be present in several other conditions, including bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder, substance intoxication, substance-induced psychosis, and a number of drug withdrawal syndromes. Non-bizarre delusions are also present in delusional disorder, and social withdrawal in social anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder has symptoms that are similar but less severe than those of schizophrenia. Schizophrenia occurs along with obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) considerably more often than could be explained by chance, although it can be difficult to distinguish obsessions that occur in OCD from the delusions of schizophrenia. There can be considerable overlap with the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.

A more general medical and neurological examination may be needed to rule out medical illnesses which may rarely produce psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as metabolic disturbance, systemic infection, syphilis, HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder, epilepsy, limbic encephalitis, and brain lesions. Stroke, multiple sclerosis, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and dementias such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Huntington&#x27;s disease, frontotemporal dementia, and the Lewy body dementias may also be associated with schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms. It may be necessary to rule out a delirium, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, and indicates an underlying medical illness. Investigations are not generally repeated for relapse unless there is a specific &quot;medical&quot; indication or possible adverse effects from antipsychotic medication. In children hallucinations must be separated from typical childhood fantasies. It is difficult to distinguish childhood schizophrenia from autism.

==Prevention==
Prevention of schizophrenia is difficult as there are no reliable markers for the later development of the disorder.

Early intervention programs diagnose and treat patients in the prodromal phase of the illness. There is some evidence that these programs reduce symptoms. Patients tend to prefer early treatment programs to ordinary treatment and are less likely to disengage from them. As of 2020, it is unclear whether the benefits of early treatment persist once the treatment is terminated.

Cognitive behavioral therapy may reduce the risk of psychosis in those at high risk after a year and is recommended in this group, by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Another preventive measure is to avoid drugs that have been associated with development of the disorder, including cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamines.

Antipsychotics are prescribed following a first-episode psychosis, and following remission, a preventive maintenance use is continued to avoid relapse. However, it is recognized that some people do recover following a single episode and that long-term use of antipsychotics will not be needed but there is no way of identifying this group.

==Management==

The primary treatment of schizophrenia is the use of antipsychotic medications, often in combination with psychosocial interventions and social supports. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment, and support groups are common. The time between the onset of psychotic symptoms to being given treatment – the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) – is associated with a poorer outcome in both the short term and the long term.

Voluntary or involuntary admission to hospital may be imposed by doctors and courts who deem a person to be having a severe episode. In the UK, large mental hospitals termed asylums began to be closed down in the 1950s with the advent of antipsychotics, and with an awareness of the negative impact of long-term hospital stays on recovery. This process was known as deinstitutionalization, and community and supportive services were developed to support this change. Many other countries followed suit with the US starting in the 60s. There still remain a smaller group of people who do not improve enough to be discharged. In some countries that lack the necessary supportive and social services, long-term hospital stays are more usual.

===Medication===
The first-line treatment for schizophrenia is an antipsychotic. The first-generation antipsychotics, now called typical antipsychotics, like haloperidol, are dopamine antagonists that block D2 receptors, and affect the neurotransmission of dopamine. Those brought out later, the second-generation antipsychotics known as atypical antipsychotics, including olanzapine and risperidone, can also have an effect on another neurotransmitter, serotonin. Antipsychotics can reduce the symptoms of anxiety within hours of their use, but, for other symptoms, they may take several days or weeks to reach their full effect. They have little effect on negative and cognitive symptoms, which may be helped by additional psychotherapies and medications. There is no single antipsychotic suitable for first-line treatment for everyone, as responses and tolerances vary between people. Stopping medication may be considered after a single psychotic episode where there has been a full recovery with no symptoms for twelve months. Repeated relapses worsen the long-term outlook and the risk of relapse following a second episode is high, and long-term treatment is usually recommended.

About half of those with schizophrenia will respond favourably to antipsychotics, and have a good return of functioning. However, positive symptoms persist in up to a third of people. Following two trials of different antipsychotics over six weeks, that also prove ineffective, they will be classed as having treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS), and clozapine will be offered. Clozapine is of benefit to around half of this group although it has the potentially serious side effect of agranulocytosis (lowered white blood cell count) in less than 4% of people.

About 30 to 50 percent of people with schizophrenia do not accept that they have an illness or comply with their recommended treatment. For those who are unwilling or unable to take medication regularly, long-acting injections of antipsychotics may be used, which reduce the risk of relapse to a greater degree than oral medications. When used in combination with psychosocial interventions, they may improve long-term adherence to treatment.

The fixed-dose combination medication xanomeline/trospium chloride (Cobenfy) was approved for medical use in the United States in September 2024. It is the first cholinergic agonist approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat schizophrenia.

Negative and cognitive symptoms are an unmet clinical need in antipsychotic-based treatment approaches. Psychostimulant drugs have been found effective in the treatment of negative symptoms, but are rarely prescribed due to concerns about the excacerbation of positive symptoms. It is possible that low-dose psychedelic therapies could be of benefit in schizophrenia through their prosocial and procognitive effects, although there is a serious risk that high dose psychedelic therapies could lead to worsening of positive symptoms.

====Adverse effects====
Extrapyramidal symptoms, including akathisia, are associated with all commercially available antipsychotic to varying degrees. There is little evidence that second generation antipsychotics have reduced levels of extrapyramidical symptoms compared to typical antipsychotics. Tardive dyskinesia can occur due to long-term use of antipsychotics, developing after months or years of use. The antipsychotic clozapine is also associated with thromboembolism (including pulmonary embolism), myocarditis, and cardiomyopathy.

===Psychosocial interventions===

A number of psychosocial interventions that include several types of psychotherapy may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia such as: family therapy, group therapy, cognitive remediation therapy (CRT), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and metacognitive training. Skills training, help with substance use, and weight management – often needed as a side effect of an antipsychotic – are also offered. In the US, interventions for first episode psychosis have been brought together in an overall approach known as coordinated speciality care (CSC) and also includes support for education. In the UK &quot;care across all phases&quot; is a similar approach that covers many of the treatment guidelines recommended. The aim is to reduce the number of relapses and stays in the hospital.

Other support services for education, employment, and housing are usually offered. For people with severe schizophrenia, who are discharged from a stay in the hospital, these services are often brought together in an integrated approach to offer support in the community away from the hospital setting. In addition to medicine management, housing, and finances, assistance is given for more routine matters such as help with shopping and using public transport. This approach is known as assertive community treatment (ACT) and has been shown to achieve positive results in symptoms, social functioning and quality of life. Another more intense approach is known as &quot;intensive care management&quot; (ICM). ICM is a stage further than ACT and emphasises support of high intensity in smaller caseloads, (less than twenty). This approach is to provide long-term care in the community. Studies show that ICM improves many of the relevant outcomes including social functioning.

Some studies have shown little evidence for the effectiveness of CBT in either reducing symptoms or preventing relapse. However, other studies have found that CBT does improve overall psychotic symptoms (when in use with medication) and it has been recommended in Canada, but has been seen to have no effect on social function, relapse, or quality of life. In the UK it is recommended as an add-on therapy in the treatment of schizophrenia. Arts therapies are seen to improve negative symptoms in some people, and are recommended by NICE in the UK. This approach is criticised as having not been well-researched, and arts therapies are not recommended in Australian guidelines for example. Peer support, in which people with personal experience of schizophrenia, provide help to each other, is of unclear benefit.

===Other===
Exercise including aerobic exercise has been shown to improve positive and negative symptoms, cognition, working memory, and improve quality of life. Exercise has also been shown to increase the volume of the hippocampus in those with schizophrenia. A decrease in hippocampal volume is one of the factors linked to the development of the disease. However, there still remains the problem of increasing motivation for, and maintaining participation in physical activity. Supervised sessions are recommended. In the UK healthy eating advice is offered alongside exercise programs.

An inadequate diet is often found in schizophrenia, and associated vitamin deficiencies including those of folate, and vitamin D are linked to the risk factors for the development of schizophrenia and for early death including heart disease. Those with schizophrenia possibly have the worst diet of all the mental disorders. Lower levels of folate and vitamin D have been noted as significantly lower in first episode psychosis. The use of supplemental folate is recommended. A zinc deficiency has also been noted. Vitamin B12 is also often deficient and this is linked to worse symptoms. Supplementation with B vitamins has been shown to significantly improve symptoms, and to put in reverse some of the cognitive deficits. It is also suggested that the noted dysfunction in gut microbiota might benefit from the use of probiotics.

==Prognosis==

Schizophrenia has great human and economic costs. It decreases life expectancy by between 10 and 28 years. This is primarily because of its association with heart disease, diabetes, obesity, poor diet, a sedentary lifestyle, and smoking, with an increased rate of suicide playing a lesser role. Side effects of antipsychotics may also increase the risk.

Almost 40% of those with schizophrenia die from complications of cardiovascular disease which is seen to be increasingly associated. An underlying factor of sudden cardiac death may be Brugada syndrome (BrS) – BrS mutations that overlap with those linked with schizophrenia are the calcium channel mutations. BrS may also be drug-induced from certain antipsychotics and antidepressants. Primary polydipsia, or excessive fluid intake, is relatively common in people with chronic schizophrenia. This may lead to hyponatremia which can be life-threatening. Antipsychotics can lead to a dry mouth, but there are several other factors that may contribute to the disorder; it may reduce life expectancy by 13 percent. Barriers to improving the mortality rate in schizophrenia are poverty, overlooking the symptoms of other illnesses, stress, stigma, and medication side effects.
Schizophrenia is a major cause of disability. In 2016, it was classed as the 12th most disabling condition. Approximately 75% of people with schizophrenia have ongoing disability with relapses. Some people do recover completely and others function well in society. Most people with schizophrenia live independently with community support. About 85% are unemployed. In people with a first episode of psychosis in schizophrenia a good long-term outcome occurs in 31%, an intermediate outcome in 42% and a poor outcome in 31%. Males are affected more often than females, and have a worse outcome. Studies showing that outcomes for schizophrenia appear better in the developing than the developed world have been questioned. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty, homelessness, exploitation, stigmatization and victimization are common consequences, and lead to social exclusion.
There is a higher than average suicide rate associated with schizophrenia estimated at 5% to 6%, most often occurring in the period following onset or first hospital admission. Several times more (20 to 40%) attempt suicide at least once. There are a variety of risk factors, including male sex, depression, a high IQ, heavy smoking, and substance use. Repeated relapse is linked to an increased risk of suicidal behavior. The use of clozapine can reduce the risk of suicide, and of aggression.
A strong association between schizophrenia and tobacco smoking has been shown in worldwide studies. Smoking is especially high in those diagnosed with schizophrenia, with estimates ranging from 80 to 90% being regular smokers, as compared to 20% of the general population. Those who smoke tend to smoke heavily, and additionally smoke cigarettes with high nicotine content. Some propose that this is in an effort to improve symptoms. Among people with schizophrenia use of cannabis is also common.

Schizophrenia leads to an increased risk of dementia.

===Violence===
Most people with schizophrenia are not aggressive, and are more likely to be victims of violence rather than perpetrators. People with schizophrenia are commonly exploited and victimized by violent crime as part of a broader dynamic of social exclusion. People diagnosed with schizophrenia are also subject to forced drug injections, seclusion, and restraint at high rates.

The risk of violence by people with schizophrenia is small. There are minor subgroups where the risk is high. This risk is usually associated with a comorbid disorder such as a substance use disorder – in particular alcohol, or with antisocial personality disorder. Substance use disorder is strongly linked, and other risk factors are linked to deficits in cognition and social cognition including facial perception and insight that are in part included in theory of mind impairments. Poor cognitive functioning, decision-making, and facial perception may contribute to making a wrong judgement of a situation that could result in an inappropriate response such as violence. These associated risk factors are also present in antisocial personality disorder which when present as a comorbid disorder greatly increases the risk of violence.

==Epidemiology==
In 2017, the Global Burden of Disease Study estimated there were 1.1 million new cases; in 2022 the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a total of 24 million cases globally. Schizophrenia affects around 0.3–0.7% of people at some point in their life. In areas of conflict this figure can rise to between 4.0 and 6.5%. It occurs 1.4 times more frequently in males than females and typically appears earlier in men.

Worldwide, schizophrenia is the most common psychotic disorder. The frequency of schizophrenia varies across the world, within countries, and at the local and neighborhood level; this variation in prevalence between studies over time, across geographical locations, and by gender is as high as fivefold.

Schizophrenia causes approximately one percent of worldwide disability adjusted life years and resulted in 17,000 deaths in 2015.

In 2000, WHO found the percentage of people affected and the number of new cases that develop each year is roughly similar around the world, with age-standardized prevalence per 100,000 ranging from 343 in Africa to 544 in Japan and Oceania for men, and from 378 in Africa to 527 in Southeastern Europe for women.

==History==
===Conceptual development===

Accounts of a schizophrenia-like syndrome are rare in records before the 19th century; the earliest case reports were in 1797 and 1809. The term &quot;dementia praecox&quot; (&quot;premature dementia&quot;) was used by German psychiatrist Heinrich Schüle in 1886 and then in 1891 by Arnold Pick in a case report of hebephrenia. In 1893 Emil Kraepelin used the term in making a distinction, known as the Kraepelinian dichotomy, between the two psychoses: dementia praecox and manic depression (now called bipolar disorder). When it became evident that the disorder was not a degenerative dementia, it was renamed &quot;schizophrenia&quot; by Eugen Bleuler in 1908.

The word &quot;schizophrenia&quot; (&quot;splitting of the mind&quot;) is Modern Latin, derived from the Greek &quot;schizein&quot; () and &quot;phrēn&quot; (). Its use was intended to describe the separation of function between personality, thinking, memory, and perception.

In the early 20th century, the psychiatrist Kurt Schneider categorized the psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia into two groups: hallucinations and delusions. The hallucinations were listed as specific to auditory and the delusions included thought disorders. These were seen as important symptoms, termed &quot;first-rank&quot;. The most common first-rank symptom was found to belong to thought disorders. In 2013 the first-rank symptoms were excluded from the DSM-5 criteria; while they may not be useful in diagnosing schizophrenia, they can assist in differential diagnosis.

Subtypes of schizophrenia—classified as paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated, and residual—were difficult to distinguish and are no longer recognized as separate conditions by DSM-5 (2013) or ICD-11.

=== Breadth of diagnosis ===
Before the 1960s, nonviolent petty criminals and women were sometimes diagnosed with schizophrenia, categorizing the latter as ill for not performing their duties as wives and mothers. In the mid- to late 1960s, black men were categorized as &quot;hostile and aggressive&quot; and diagnosed as schizophrenic at much higher rates, their civil rights and Black Power activism labeled as delusions.

In the early 1970s in the United States, the diagnostic model for schizophrenia was broad and clinically based using DSM II. Schizophrenia was diagnosed far more in the United States than in Europe, where the ICD-9 criteria were followed. The US model was criticised for failing to demarcate clearly those people with a mental illness. In 1980 DSM III was published and showed a shift in focus from the clinically based biopsychosocial model to a reason-based medical model. DSM IV brought an increased focus on an evidence-based medical model.

=== Historical treatment ===
In the 1930s a number of shock procedures which induced seizures (convulsions) or comas were used to treat schizophrenia. Insulin shock involved injecting large doses of insulin to induce comas, which in turn produced hypoglycemia and convulsions. The use of electricity to induce seizures was in use as electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) by 1938.

Carried out from the 1930s until the 1970s in the United States and until the 1980s in France, psychosurgery, including such modalities as the lobotomy, is recognized as a human rights abuse. In the mid-1950s, chlorpromazine, the first typical antipsychotic, was introduced, followed in the 1970s by clozapine, the first atypical antipsychotic.

=== Political abuse ===

From the 1960s until 1989, psychiatrists in the USSR and Eastern Bloc diagnosed thousands of people with sluggish schizophrenia, without signs of psychosis, based on &quot;the assumption that symptoms would later appear&quot;. Now discredited, the diagnosis provided a convenient way to confine political dissidents.

==Society and culture==
In the United States, the annual cost of schizophrenia – including direct costs (outpatient, inpatient, drugs, and long-term care) and non-healthcare costs (law enforcement, reduced workplace productivity, and unemployment) – was estimated at $62.7 billion for the year 2002. In the UK the cost in 2016 was put at £11.8 billion per year with a third of that figure directly attributable to the cost of hospital, social care and treatment.

=== Stigma ===
In 2002, the term for schizophrenia in Japan was changed from to to reduce stigma and confusion with &quot;multiple personalities&quot;. The new name, also interpreted as &quot;integration disorder&quot;, was inspired by the biopsychosocial model. A similar change was made in South Korea in 2012 to attunement disorder.

Stigma may prevent further research and treatment as in history treated some in the past invariably worse to recovery.

=== Cultural depictions ===
Media coverage, especially movies, reinforce the public perception of an association between schizophrenia and violence. A majority of movies have historically depicted characters with schizophrenia as criminal, dangerous, violent, unpredictable and homicidal, and depicted delusions and hallucinations as the main symptoms of schizophrenic characters, ignoring other common symptoms, furthering stereotypes of schizophrenia including the idea of a split personality.

The book &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot; chronicled the life of John Forbes Nash who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences. The book was made into a film with the same name; an earlier documentary film was &quot;A Brilliant Madness&quot;.

In the UK, guidelines for reporting conditions and award campaigns have shown a reduction in negative reporting since 2013.

In 1964 a case study of three males diagnosed with schizophrenia who each had the delusional belief that they were Jesus Christ was published as &quot;The Three Christs of Ypsilanti&quot;; a film with the title &quot;Three Christs&quot; was released in 2020.

==Research directions==

A 2015 Cochrane review found unclear evidence of benefit from brain stimulation techniques to treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, in particular auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs). Most studies focus on transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCM), and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). Techniques based on focused ultrasound for deep brain stimulation could provide insight for the treatment of AVHs.

The study of potential biomarkers that would help in diagnosis and treatment of schizophrenia is an active area of research as of 2020. Possible biomarkers include markers of inflammation, neuroimaging, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and speech analysis. Some markers such as C-reactive protein are useful in detecting levels of inflammation implicated in some psychiatric disorders but they are not disorder-specific. Other inflammatory cytokines are found to be elevated in first episode psychosis and acute relapse that are normalized after treatment with antipsychotics, and these may be considered as state markers. Deficits in sleep spindles in schizophrenia may serve as a marker of an impaired thalamocortical circuit, and a mechanism for memory impairment. MicroRNAs are highly influential in early neuronal development, and their disruption is implicated in several CNS disorders; circulating microRNAs (cimiRNAs) are found in body fluids such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and changes in their levels are seen to relate to changes in microRNA levels in specific regions of brain tissue. These studies suggest that cimiRNAs have the potential to be early and accurate biomarkers in a number of disorders including schizophrenia.

Ongoing fMRI research aims to identify biomarkers within these brain networks, potentially aiding in earlier diagnosis and better tracking of treatment responses in schizophrenia.

<doc id="27791" wikidata="Q7103" url="?curid=27791" title="Sophie Germain">
<text>Marie-Sophie Germain (; 1 April 1776 – 27 June 1831) was a French mathematician, physicist, and philosopher. Despite initial opposition from her parents and difficulties presented by society, she gained education from books in her father&#x27;s library, including ones by Euler, and from correspondence with famous mathematicians such as Lagrange, Legendre, and Gauss (under the pseudonym of Monsieur Le Blanc). One of the pioneers of elasticity theory, she won the grand prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences for her essay on the subject. Her work on Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem provided a foundation for mathematicians exploring the subject for hundreds of years after. Because of prejudice against her sex, she was unable to make a career out of mathematics, but she worked independently throughout her life. Before her death, Gauss had recommended that she be awarded an honorary degree, but that never occurred. On 27 June 1831, she died from breast cancer. At the centenary of her life, a street and a girls&#x27; school were named after her. The Academy of Sciences established the Sophie Germain Prize in her honour.

==Early life==

===Family===

Marie-Sophie Germain was born in a house on Rue Saint-Denis on 1 April 1776, in Paris, France. According to most sources, her father, Ambroise-François, was a wealthy silk merchant, though some believe he was a goldsmith. In 1789, he was elected as a representative of the bourgeoisie to the États-Généraux, which he saw change into the National Assembly. It is therefore assumed that Sophie witnessed many discussions between her father and his friends on politics and philosophy. Gray proposes that after his political career, Ambroise-François became the director of a bank; in any case, the family remained well-off enough to support Germain throughout her adult life.

Marie-Sophie had one younger sister, Angélique-Ambroise, and one older sister, Marie-Madeline. Her mother was also named Marie-Madeline, and this plethora of &quot;Maries&quot; may have been the reason she went by Sophie. Germain&#x27;s nephew Armand-Jacques Lherbette, Marie-Madeline&#x27;s son, published some of Germain&#x27;s work after she died (see Work in Philosophy).

===Introduction to mathematics===
When Germain was 13, the Bastille fell, and the revolutionary atmosphere of the city forced her to stay inside. For entertainment, she turned to her father&#x27;s library. Here she found J. E. Montucla&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Histoire des Mathématiques&quot;, and his story of the death of Archimedes intrigued her.

Germain thought that if the geometry method, which at that time referred to all of pure mathematics, could hold such fascination for Archimedes, it was a subject worthy of study. So she pored over every book on mathematics in her father&#x27;s library, even teaching herself Latin and Greek, so she could read works like those of Sir Isaac Newton and Leonhard Euler. She also enjoyed by Étienne Bézout and by Jacques Antoine-Joseph Cousin. Later, Cousin visited Germain at home, encouraging her in her studies.

Germain&#x27;s parents did not at all approve of her sudden fascination with mathematics, which was then thought inappropriate for a woman. When night came, they would deny her warm clothes and a fire for her bedroom to try to keep her from studying, but after they left, she would take out candles, wrap herself in quilts and do mathematics. After some time, her mother even secretly supported her.

===École Polytechnique===

In 1794, when Germain was 18, the École Polytechnique opened. As a woman, Germain was barred from attending, but the new system of education made the &quot;lecture notes available to all who asked&quot;. The new method also required the students to &quot;submit written observations&quot;. Germain obtained the lecture notes and began sending her work to Joseph Louis Lagrange, a faculty member. She used the name of a former student Monsieur Antoine-Auguste Le Blanc, &quot;fearing&quot;, as she later explained to Gauss, &quot;the ridicule attached to a female scientist&quot;. When Lagrange saw the intelligence of M. Le Blanc, he requested a meeting, and thus Sophie was forced to disclose her true identity. Fortunately, Lagrange did not mind that Germain was a woman, and he became her mentor.

==Early work in number theory==

===Correspondence with Legendre===
Germain first became interested in number theory in 1798 when Adrien-Marie Legendre published . After studying the work, she opened correspondence with him on number theory, and later, elasticity. Legendre included some of Germain&#x27;s work in the to his second edition of the , where he calls it (&quot;very ingenious&quot;). See also Her work on Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem below.

===Correspondence with Gauss===
Germain&#x27;s interest in number theory was renewed when she read Carl Friedrich Gauss&#x27;s monumental work . After three years of working through the exercises and trying her own proofs for some of the theorems, she wrote, again under the pseudonym of M. Le Blanc, to the author himself, who was one year younger than she. The first letter, dated 21 November 1804, discussed Gauss&#x27;s and presented some of Germain&#x27;s work on Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. In the letter, Germain claimed to have proved the theorem for &quot;n&quot; = &quot;p&quot; − 1, where &quot;p&quot; is a prime number of the form &quot;p&quot; = 8&quot;k&quot; + 7. However, her proof contained a weak assumption, and Gauss&#x27;s reply did not comment on Germain&#x27;s proof.

Around 1807 (sources differ), during the Napoleonic wars, the French were occupying the German town of Braunschweig, where Gauss lived. Germain, concerned that he might suffer the fate of Archimedes, wrote to General Pernety (Joseph Marie de Pernety), a family friend, requesting that he ensure Gauss&#x27;s safety. General Pernety sent the chief of a battalion to meet with Gauss personally to see that he was safe. As it turned out, Gauss was fine, but he was confused by the mention of Sophie&#x27;s name.

Three months after the incident, Germain disclosed her true identity to Gauss. He replied:
Gauss&#x27;s letters to Olbers show that his praise for Germain was sincere. In the same 1807 letter, Germain claimed that if formula_1 is of the form formula_2, then formula_3 is also of that form. Gauss replied with a counterexample: formula_4 can be written as formula_5, but formula_6 cannot.

Although Gauss thought well of Germain, his replies to her letters were often delayed, and he generally did not review her work. Eventually his interests turned away from number theory, and in 1809 the letters ceased. Despite the friendship of Germain and Gauss, they never met.

==Work in elasticity==

===Germain&#x27;s first attempt for the Academy Prize===

When Germain&#x27;s correspondence with Gauss ceased, she took interest in a contest sponsored by the Paris Academy of Sciences concerning Ernst Chladni&#x27;s experiments with vibrating metal plates. The object of the competition, as stated by the academy, was &quot;to give the mathematical theory of the vibration of an elastic surface and to compare the theory to experimental evidence&quot;. Lagrange&#x27;s comment that a solution to the problem would require the invention of a new branch of analysis deterred all but two contestants, Denis Poisson and Germain. Then Poisson was elected to the academy, thus becoming a judge instead of a contestant, and leaving Germain as the only entrant to the competition.

In 1809 Germain began work. Legendre assisted by giving her equations, references, and current research. She submitted her paper early in the fall of 1811 and did not win the prize. The judging commission felt that &quot;the true equations of the movement were not established&quot;, even though &quot;the experiments presented ingenious results&quot;. Lagrange was able to use Germain&#x27;s work to derive an equation that was &quot;correct under special assumptions&quot;.

===Subsequent attempts for the Prize===
The contest was extended by two years, and Germain decided to try again for the prize. At first Legendre continued to offer support, but then he refused all help. Germain&#x27;s anonymous 1813 submission was still littered with mathematical errors, especially involving double integrals, and it received only an honorable mention because &quot;the fundamental base of the theory [of elastic surfaces] was not established&quot;. The contest was extended once more, and Germain began work on her third attempt. This time she consulted with Poisson. In 1814 he published his own work on elasticity and did not acknowledge Germain&#x27;s help (although he had worked with her on the subject and, as a judge on the academy commission, had had access to her work).

Germain submitted her third paper, &quot;&quot;, under her own name, and on 8 January 1816 she became the first woman to win a prize from the Paris Academy of Sciences. She did not appear at the ceremony to receive her award. Although Germain had at last been awarded the , the academy was still not fully satisfied. Germain had derived the correct differential equation (a special case of the Kirchhoff–Love equation), but her method did not predict experimental results with great accuracy, as she had relied on an incorrect equation from Euler, which led to incorrect boundary conditions. Here is Germain&#x27;s final equation for the vibration of a plane lamina:

: formula_7

where &quot;N&quot;2 is a constant.

After winning the academy contest, she was still not able to attend its sessions because of the academy&#x27;s tradition of excluding women other than the wives of members. Seven years later this situation was transformed, when she made friends with Joseph Fourier, a secretary of the academy, who obtained tickets to the sessions for her.

===Later work in elasticity===

Germain published her prize-winning essay at her own expense in 1821, mostly because she wanted to present her work in opposition to that of Poisson. In the essay she pointed out some of the errors in his method.

In 1826 she submitted a revised version of her 1821 essay to the academy. According to Andrea Del Centina, the revision included attempts to clarify her work by &quot;introducing certain simplifying hypotheses&quot;. This put the academy in an awkward position, as they felt the paper to be &quot;inadequate and trivial&quot;, but they did not want to &quot;treat her as a professional colleague, as they would any man, by simply rejecting the work&quot;. So Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who had been appointed to review her work, recommended her to publish it, and she followed his advice.

One further work of Germain&#x27;s on elasticity was published posthumously in 1831, her &quot;&quot;. She used the mean curvature in her research (see Honors in number theory).

==Later work in number theory==

===Renewed interest===
Germain&#x27;s best work was in number theory, and her most significant contribution to number theory dealt with Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. In 1815, after the elasticity contest, the academy offered a prize for a proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. It reawakened Germain&#x27;s interest in number theory, and she wrote to Gauss again after ten years of no correspondence.

In the letter, Germain said that number theory was her preferred field and that it was in her mind all the time she was studying elasticity. She outlined a strategy for a general proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, including a proof for a special case. Germain&#x27;s letter to Gauss contained her substantial progress toward a proof. She asked Gauss whether her approach to the theorem was worth pursuing. Gauss never answered.

===Her work on Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem===

Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem can be divided into two cases. Case 1 involves all powers &quot;p&quot; that do not divide any of &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, or &quot;z&quot;. Case 2 includes all &quot;p&quot; that divide at least one of &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, or &quot;z&quot;. Germain proposed the following, commonly called &quot;Sophie Germain&#x27;s theorem&quot;:
Germain used this result to prove the first case of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for all odd primes &quot;p&quot; &lt; 100, but according to Andrea Del Centina, &quot;she had actually shown that it holds for every exponent &quot;p&quot; &lt; 197&quot;. L. E. Dickson later used Germain&#x27;s theorem to prove the first case of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for all odd primes less than 1700.

In an unpublished manuscript titled , Germain showed that any counterexamples to Fermat&#x27;s theorem for &quot;p&quot; &gt; 5 must be numbers &quot;whose size frightens the imagination&quot;, around 40 digits long. Germain did not publish this work. Her theorem is known only because of the footnote in Legendre&#x27;s treatise on number theory, where he used it to prove Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem for &quot;p&quot; = 5 (see Correspondence with Legendre). Germain also proved or nearly proved several results that were attributed to Lagrange or were rediscovered years later. Del Centina states that &quot;after almost two hundred years her ideas were still central&quot;, but ultimately her method did not work.

==Work in philosophy==
In addition to mathematics, Germain studied philosophy and psychology. She wanted to classify facts and generalize them into laws that could form a system of psychology and sociology, which were then just coming into existence. Her philosophy was highly praised by Auguste Comte.

Two of her philosophical works, and , were published, both posthumously. This was due in part to the efforts of Lherbette, her nephew, who collected her philosophical writings and published them. is a collection of personal notes on scientific subjects (the writings of Tycho, Newton, and Laplace), aphorisms, and philosophical reflections. In , the work admired by Comte, Germain argues that there are no substantive differences between the sciences and the humanities.

==Final years==
In 1829 Germain learned that she had breast cancer. Despite the pain, she continued to work. In 1831 &quot;Crelle&#x27;s Journal&quot; published her paper on the curvature of elastic surfaces and &quot;a note about finding and in formula_8&quot;. Mary Gray records: &quot;She also published in an examination of principles which led to the discovery of the laws of equilibrium and movement of elastic solids.&quot; On 27 June 1831, she died in the house at 13 rue de Savoie.

Despite Germain&#x27;s intellectual achievements, her death certificate lists her as a &quot; (property holder), not a &quot;. But her work was not unappreciated by everyone. When the matter of honorary degrees came up at the University of Göttingen in 1837—six years after Germain&#x27;s death—Gauss lamented: &quot;she [Germain] proved to the world that even a woman can accomplish something worthwhile in the most rigorous and abstract of the sciences and for that reason would well have deserved an honorary degree&quot;.

==Honors==

===Memorials===

Germain&#x27;s resting place in the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris is marked by a gravestone. At the centennial celebration of her life, a street and a girls&#x27; school were named after her, and a plaque was placed at the house where she died. The school houses a bust commissioned by the Paris City Council.

In January 2020, Satellogic, a high-resolution Earth observation imaging and analytics company, launched a ÑuSat type micro-satellite named in honor of Sophie Germain.

===Honors in number theory===
E. Dubouis defined a &quot;sophien&quot; of a prime to be a prime where , for such that yield such that has no solutions when and are prime to .

A Sophie Germain prime is a prime such that is also prime.

The &quot;Germain curvature&quot; (also called mean curvature) is formula_9, where and are the maximum and minimum values of the normal curvature.

Sophie Germain&#x27;s identity states that for any ,

==Assessments==

===Contemporary assessments===
Vesna Petrovich found that the educated world&#x27;s response to the publication in 1821 of Germain&#x27;s prize-winning essay &quot;ranged from polite to indifferent&quot;. Yet, some critics had high praise for it. Of her essay in 1821, Cauchy said: &quot;[it] was a work for which the name of its author and the importance of the subject both deserved the attention of mathematicians&quot;. Germain was also included in H. J. Mozans&#x27; 1913 book &quot;Woman in Science&quot;, although Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie claims that the biography &quot;is inaccurate and the notes and bibliography are unreliable&quot;. Nevertheless, it quotes the mathematician Claude-Louis Navier as saying that &quot;it is a work which few men are able to read and which only one woman was able to write&quot;.

Germain&#x27;s contemporaries also had good things to say relating to her work in mathematics. Gauss certainly thought highly of her and recognized that European culture presented special difficulties to a woman in mathematics (see Correspondence with Gauss).

===Modern assessments===
The modern view generally acknowledges that although Germain had great talent as a mathematician, her haphazard education had left her without the strong base she needed to truly excel. As explained by Gray, &quot;Germain&#x27;s work in elasticity suffered generally from an absence of rigor, which might be attributed to her lack of formal training in the rudiments of analysis.&quot; Petrovich adds: &quot;This proved to be a major handicap when she could no longer be regarded as a young prodigy to be admired but was judged by her peer mathematicians.&quot;

Notwithstanding the problems with Germain&#x27;s theory of vibrations, Gray states that &quot;Germain&#x27;s work was fundamental in the development of a general theory of elasticity.&quot; Mozans writes, however, that when the Eiffel Tower was built and the architects inscribed the names of 72 great French scientists, Germain&#x27;s name was not among them, despite the salience of her work to the tower&#x27;s construction. Mozans asked: &quot;Was she excluded from this list ... because she was a woman? It would seem so.&quot;

Concerning her early work in number theory, J. H. Sampson states: &quot;She was clever with formal algebraic manipulations; but there is little evidence that she really understood the , and her work of that period that has come down to us seems to touch only on rather superficial matters.&quot; Gray adds on to say &quot;The inclination of sympathetic mathematicians to praise her work rather than to provide substantive criticism from which she might learn was crippling to her mathematical development.&quot; Yet Marilyn Bailey Ogilvie recognizes that &quot;Sophie Germain&#x27;s creativity manifested itself in pure and applied mathematics ... [she] provided imaginative and provocative solutions to several important problems&quot;, and, as Petrovich proposes, it may have been her very lack of training that gave her unique insights and approaches. Louis Bucciarelli and Nancy Dworsky, Germain&#x27;s biographers, summarize as follows: &quot;All the evidence argues that Sophie Germain had a mathematical brilliance that never reached fruition due to a lack of rigorous training available only to men.&quot;

==Germain in popular culture==
Germain was referenced and quoted in David Auburn&#x27;s 2001 play &quot;Proof.&quot; The protagonist is a young struggling female mathematician, Catherine, who found great inspiration in the work of Germain. Germain was also mentioned in John Madden&#x27;s film adaptation of the same name in a conversation between Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Hal (Jake Gyllenhaal).

In the fictional work &quot;The Last Theorem&quot; by Arthur C. Clarke and Frederik Pohl, Sophie Germain was credited with inspiring the central character, Ranjit Subramanian, to solve Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem.

A musical about Sophie Germain&#x27;s life, entitled &quot;The Limit&quot;, premiered at VAULT Festival in London, 2019.

Sophie Germain is referenced in Season 1 Episode 3 of the 2025 British miniseries &quot;Prime Target&quot;. A library book entitled &quot;Sophie Germain: The Unsolved Riddle&quot; (there appears to be no such book) serves as a &quot;mailbox&quot; for a brilliant, deceased prime number theorist named Safiya Zamil to have passed a handwritten note to a future mathematician on a similar prime number quest.

==Sophie Germain Prize==

The Sophie Germain Prize (), awarded annually by the Foundation Sophie Germain, is conferred by the Academy of Sciences in Paris. Its purpose is to honour a French mathematician for research in the foundations of mathematics. This award, in the amount of €8,000, was established in 2003, under the auspices of the Institut de France.

<doc id="27796" wikidata="Q715822" url="?curid=27796" title="Succubus">
<text>A succubus (: succubi) is a female demon or supernatural entity in folklores who appears in dreams to seduce men, mostly through sexual activity. According to some folklore, a succubus needs male semen to survive; repeated sexual activity with a succubus will result in a bond being formed between the succubus and the person; and a succubus will drain or harm the man with whom she is having intercourse.

In modern representations, a succubus is often depicted as a beautiful seductress or enchantress, rather than as demonic or frightening to attract people instead of frighten. The male counterpart to the succubus is the incubus.

==Etymology==
The term derives from Late Latin &#x27; &quot;paramour&quot; from &#x27; &quot;to lie beneath&quot; (&quot;-&quot; &quot;under&quot; and &quot;&quot; &quot;to lie&quot;), used to describe this being&#x27;s implied sexual position relative to the sleeper&#x27;s position. The English word &quot;succubus&quot; dates from the late 14th century. The succubus is also known as the earth wanderer.

==In folklore==
As depicted in the Jewish mystical treatise &quot;Zohar&quot; and the medieval Jewish satirical text &quot;Alphabet of Ben Sira&quot;, Lilith was Adam&#x27;s first wife, who later became a succubus. She left Adam and refused to return to the Garden of Eden after she mated with the archangel Samael. In Zoharistic Kabbalah, there were four succubi who mated with the archangel Samael. The four original queens of the demons were Lilith, Eisheth Zenunim, Agrat bat Mahlat, and Naamah. A succubus may take a form of a beautiful woman, but closer inspection may reveal deformities of her body, such as bird-like claws or serpentine tails. Folklore also describes men being forced to perform the act of cunnilingus. In later folklore, a succubus took the form of a siren.

Throughout history, priests and rabbis, including Hanina ben Dosa and Abaye, tried to curb the power of succubi over humans. However, not all succubi were malevolent. According to Walter Map in the satire &quot;&quot; (&quot;Trifles of Courtiers&quot;), Pope Sylvester II (999–1003) was allegedly involved with a succubus named Meridiana, who helped him achieve his high rank in the Catholic Church. Before his death, he confessed of his sins and died repentant.

==Ability to reproduce==
According to the Kabbalah and the school of Rashba, the original three queens of the demons, Agrat bat Mahlat, Naamah, Eisheth Zenunim, and all their cohorts give birth to children, except Lilith. According to other legends, the children of Lilith are called Lilin.

According to the &quot;&quot;, or &quot;Witches&#x27; Hammer&quot;, written by Heinrich Kramer (Institoris) in 1486, succubi collect semen from men they seduce. Incubi, or male demons, then use the semen to impregnate human females, thus explaining how demons could apparently sire children, despite the traditional belief that they were incapable of reproduction. Children so begotten—cambions—were supposed to be those that were born deformed, or more susceptible to supernatural influences.

King James in his dissertation titled &quot;Dæmonologie &quot;refutes the possibility for angelic entities to reproduce and instead offered a suggestion that a devil would carry out two methods of impregnating women - the first, to steal the sperm out of a dead man and deliver it into a woman. If a demon could extract the semen quickly, the substance could not be instantly transported to a female host, causing it to go cold. This explains his view that succubi and incubi were the same demonic entity, only to be described differently based on the tormented sexes being conversed with. The second method was the idea that a dead body could be possessed by a devil, causing it to rise and have sexual relations with others. However, no mention has been found of a female corpse being possessed to elicit sex from men.

A Buddhist scripture regarding prayer to Avalokiteśvara, the &quot;Dharani Sutra of Amoghapāśa&quot;, promises to those who pray that &quot;you will not be attacked by demons who either suck your energy or make love to you in your dreams.&quot;

===Arabian mythology===
In Arabian mythology, the &#x27; () is a spirit similar to the succubus, with origins possibly in ancient Egyptian religion or in the animistic beliefs of pre-Islamic Arabia. A &#x27; &quot;sleeps with the person and has relations during sleep as is known by the dreams&quot;. They are said to be invisible, but a person with &quot;second sight&quot; can see them, often in the form of a cat, dog, or other household pet. &quot;In Omdurman it is a spirit which possesses. ...Only certain people are possessed and such people cannot marry or the qarina will harm them.&quot;

In Upper Egyptian folk belief, the &quot;qarînah&quot; can be appeased by sacrificing an all-black animal to her. The animal is slaughtered without prayers, and it is cooked without salt. No one speaks during the meal and it is buried in the house of those it has afflicted.

<doc id="27797" wikidata="Q236112" url="?curid=27797" title="Suzanne Vega">
<text>Suzanne Nadine Vega ( Peck; born July 11, 1959) is an American singer-songwriter of folk-inspired music. Vega&#x27;s music career spans almost 40 years. In the mid-1980s and 1990s she released four singles that entered the Top 40 charts in the UK, &quot;Marlene on the Wall&quot;, &quot;Left of Center&quot;, &quot;Luka&quot; and &quot;No Cheap Thrill&quot;.

&quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot;, which was originally released as an &quot;a cappella&quot; recording on Vega&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Solitude Standing&quot; (1987), was remixed in 1990 as a dance track by English electronic duo DNA with Vega as featured artist, and it became a Top 10 hit in five countries. The original &quot;a cappella&quot; recording of the song was used as a test during the creation of the MP3 format. The role of her song in the development of the MP3 compression prompted Vega to be given the title of &quot;The Mother of the MP3&quot;.

Vega has released nine studio albums, the most recent being 2020’s &quot;An Evening of New York Songs and Stories&quot;.

== Early life ==
Suzanne Nadine Vega was born on July 11, 1959, in Santa Monica, California. Her parents divorced soon after her birth. Her mother, Pat Vega (née Schumacher), is a computer systems analyst of German-Swedish heritage. Her father, Richard Peck, is of English, Irish and Scottish origin. Her stepfather, Edgardo Vega Yunqué, also known as Ed Vega, was a writer and teacher from Puerto Rico. When Vega was two and a half, her family moved to New York City. She grew up in Spanish Harlem and the Upper West Side. She was not aware that Peck was her biological father until she was nine years old. Vega and Peck met for the first time in her late 20s, and they remain in contact.

She attended the High School of Performing Arts (since renamed Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School) where she studied modern dance and graduated in 1977.

== Career ==
=== 1980s ===
While majoring in English literature at Barnard College, she performed in small venues in Greenwich Village, where she was a regular contributor to Jack Hardy&#x27;s Monday night songwriters&#x27; group at the Cornelia Street Cafe and had some of her first songs published on &quot;Fast Folk&quot; anthology albums. In 1984, she received a major label recording contract, making her one of the first &#x27;Fast Folk&#x27; artists to break out on a major label.

Vega&#x27;s self-titled debut studio album was released in 1985 and was well received by critics in the U.S.; it reached platinum status in the United Kingdom. Produced by Lenny Kaye and Steve Addabbo, the songs feature Vega&#x27;s acoustic guitar in straightforward arrangements. A video was released for the album&#x27;s song &quot;Marlene on the Wall&quot;, which went into MTV and VH1&#x27;s rotations. During this period Vega also wrote lyrics for two songs (&quot;Lightning&quot; and &quot;Freezing&quot;) on &quot;Songs from Liquid Days&quot; (1986) by composer Philip Glass.

Vega&#x27;s song &quot;Left of Center&quot; co-written with Steve Addabbo for the 1986 John Hughes film &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; reached No. 32 on the UK Singles Chart in 1986.

Her next studio album, &quot;Solitude Standing&quot; (1987), garnered critical and commercial success, selling over one million copies in the U.S. It includes the international hit single &quot;Luka&quot;, which is written about, and from the point of view of, an abused child. (Not until many years later did Vega reveal the song dealt with the abuse she herself had suffered from her stepfather.) While continuing a focus on Vega&#x27;s acoustic guitar, the music of her second album is more strongly pop-oriented and features fuller arrangements. Following the success of the album, in 1989 Vega became the first female artist to headline the Glastonbury Festival. Vega performed her set whilst wearing a bulletproof vest, her band having received death threats from an obsessed fan ahead of the festival.

The a cappella &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot; from &quot;Solitude Standing&quot; became a hit in 1990, having been remixed by two British dance producers under the name DNA. The track was originally a bootleg, until Vega allowed DNA to release it through her record company, and it became her biggest hit.

=== 1990s ===
Vega&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Days of Open Hand&quot; (1990), continued in the style of her first two studio albums.

In 1992, she released her fourth studio album , which mixed folk and pop music with electronic elements. This record was awarded Gold status by the RIAA in recognition of selling over 500,000 copies in the U.S. The single &quot;Blood Makes Noise&quot; from this album peaked at number-one on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Modern Rock Tracks. Vega later married the album&#x27;s producer, Mitchell Froom.

Her fifth studio album, &quot;Nine Objects of Desire&quot;, was released in 1996. The music varies between a frugal, simple style and the industrial production of . This album contains &quot;Caramel&quot;, featured in the movie &quot;The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs&quot; (1996), and later the trailer for the movie &quot;Closer&quot; (2004). A song not included on that album, &quot;Woman on the Tier&quot;, was featured on the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; (1996).

In 1997 she took a singing part on the concept album &quot;Heaven &amp; Hell&quot;, a musical interpretation of the seven deadly sins by her colleague Joe Jackson, with whom she had already collaborated in 1986 on &quot;Left of Center&quot; from the &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; soundtrack (with Vega singing and Jackson playing piano).

In 1999, Avon Books published Vega&#x27;s book &quot;The Passionate Eye: The Collected Writings of Suzanne Vega&quot;, a volume of poems, lyrics, essays and journalistic pieces.

=== 2000s ===
In September 2001, Vega released a new studio album entitled &quot;Songs in Red and Gray&quot;. Three songs deal with Vega&#x27;s divorce from her first husband, Mitchell Froom.

At the memorial concert for her brother Tim Vega in December 2002, Vega began her role as the subject of the direct-cinema documentary, &quot;Some Journey&quot;, directed by Christopher Seufert of Mooncusser Films. The documentary has not been completed.

Underground hip hop duo Felt named a track &quot;Suzanne Vega&quot; on their studio album &quot;&quot;, released in 2002.

In 2003, the 21-song greatest hits compilation album &quot;&quot; was released. (The UK version of &quot;Retrospective&quot; included an eight-song bonus CD as well as a DVD containing 12 songs). In the same year she was invited by Grammy Award-winning jazz guitarist Bill Frisell to play at the &quot;Century of Song&quot; concerts at the famed Ruhrtriennale in Germany.

In 2003, she hosted the American Public Media radio series &quot;American Mavericks&quot;, about 20th century American composers, which received the Peabody Award for Excellence in Broadcasting.

On August 3, 2006, Vega became the first major recording artist to perform live in the Internet-based virtual world, &quot;Second Life&quot;. The event was hosted by John Hockenberry of public radio&#x27;s &quot;The Infinite Mind&quot;.

On September 17, 2006, she performed in Central Park, as part of a benefit concert for the Save Darfur Coalition. During the concert she highlighted her support for Amnesty International, of which she has been a member since 1988.

In early October 2006, Vega participated in the Academia Film Olomouc (AFO) in Olomouc, the Czech Republic, the oldest festival of documentary films in Europe, in which she appeared as a main guest. She was invited there as the subject of the documentary film by director Christopher Seufert, that had a test screening at the festival. At the end of the festival she performed her classic songs and added one brand new piece called &quot;New York Is a Woman&quot;.

Vega is also interviewed in the book &quot;Everything Is Just a Bet&quot; which was published in Czech in October 2006. The book contains 12 interview transcriptions from the talk show called &quot;Stage Talks&quot; that regularly runs in the Švandovo divadlo (Švandovo Theatre) in Prague. Vega introduced the book to the audience of the Švandovo divadlo (Švandovo Theatre), and together with some other Czech celebrities gave a signing session.

She signed a new recording contract with Blue Note Records in the spring of 2006, and released &quot;Beauty &amp; Crime&quot; on July 17, 2007. The album, produced by Jimmy Hogarth, won a Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical. Her contract was not renewed and she was released in June 2008.

In 2007, Vega followed the lead of numerous other mainstream artists and released her track &quot;Pornographer&#x27;s Dream&quot; as podsafe. The song spent two weeks at number-one during 2007 and finished as the No. 11 hit of the year on the PMC Top10&#x27;s annual countdown. In 2015, Vega joined The 14th Annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians&#x27; careers.

 She was also a judge for the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th and 13th Independent Music Awards.

In 2008, fire at a Universal Music Group vault in Los Angeles County resulted in the loss or damage of some Vega recordings.

=== 2010s ===
A partial cover version of her song &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot; was used to introduce the 2010 British movie &quot;4.3.2.1.&quot;, with its lyrics largely rewritten to echo the plot. This musical hybrid was released as &quot;Keep Moving&quot;. Vega participated in the Danger Mouse and Sparklehorse studio album &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot; (2010). She wrote both melody and lyrics for her song, which is titled &quot;Man Who Played God&quot;, inspired by a biography of Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. Vega sang lead vocals on the song &quot;Now I Am an Arsonist&quot; with singer-songwriter Jonathan Coulton on his studio album, &quot;Artificial Heart&quot; (2011).

Vega has re-recorded her back-catalogue, both for artistic and commercial (and control) reasons, in the &quot;Close-up&quot; series. Vol. 1 (&quot;Love Songs&quot;) and Vol. 2 (&quot;People &amp; Places&quot;) appeared in 2010 while Vol. 3 (&quot;States of Being&quot;) was released in July 2011 followed by Vol. 4 (&quot;Songs of Family&quot;) in September 2012. Volumes 2, 3 and 4 of the &quot;Close-Up&quot; albums included previously unrecorded material; Volumes 2 and 3 each included one new collaboratively written song, while Volume 4 included three songs that Vega had written years earlier, but had not previously gotten around to recording. In all, Vega&#x27;s &quot;Close-Up&quot; series features 60 re-recorded songs and five new compositions, representing about three-quarters of her lifetime songwriting output.

While performing live, Vega and long-term collaborator Gerry Leonard began to introduce a number of new songs into the setlist, including the live favorite &quot;I Never Wear White&quot;. Over the course of a year, the songs were completed and recorded in a live-studio setting with the help of a number of guests. Produced by Leonard, &quot;Tales from the Realm of the Queen of Pentacles&quot; was released in February 2014. It was her first album of new material in seven years and became Vega&#x27;s first studio album to reach the UK Top 40 since 1992, peaking at No. 37.

Vega&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Lover, Beloved: Songs from an Evening with Carson McCullers&quot;, was released on October 14, 2016.

=== 2020s ===
In February and March 2023, Vega was to tour the UK.

== Songwriting ==
At the age of nine she began to write poetry. She was encouraged to do so by her stepfather. It took her three years to write her first song, &quot;Brother Mine&quot;, which was finished at the age of 14. It was first published on &quot;Close-Up Vol. 4, Songs of Family&quot; (2012), along with her other early song, &quot;The Silver Lady&quot;.

Vega has not learned to read musical notation; she sees the melody as a shape and chords as colors. She focuses on lyrics and melodic ideas; for advanced features – like intros or bridges – she relies on other artists with whom she works. Most of her albums, except the first one, were made in such cooperation.

Vega finishes 80% of the songs she starts writing. She got the melody of &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot; while walking down Broadway in New York. She was thinking of French New Wave films.

The most important artistic influences on her work come from Lou Reed, Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen. Some other important artists for her are Paul Simon and Laura Nyro.

== Guitars ==
Suzanne Vega currently plays Furch guitars, a brand made in the Czech Republic and was the focus of a win-a-guitar competition run by Furch in 2021. In the mid-1980s she played Guild guitars, and in the 1990s she played Yamaha and Taylor guitars at different times.

== Theater ==
Vega and Duncan Sheik wrote a play &quot;Carson McCullers Talks About Love&quot;, about the life of the writer Carson McCullers. In the play directed by Kay Matschullat, which premiered in 2011, Vega alternates between monologue and songs. Vega and Sheik were nominated for Outstanding Music in a Play for the 57th annual Drama Desk awards.

The album &quot;Lover, Beloved: Songs from an Evening with Carson McCullers&quot;, based on this play, was released in 2016. Vega considers it to be a third version, because it&#x27;s rewritten, and she made the first version in college.

In early 2020, Vega played the role of &quot;Band Leader&quot; in an off-Broadway musical based on the 1969 movie &quot;Bob &amp; Carol &amp; Ted &amp; Alice&quot;, directed by Scott Elliott and produced at The New Group in New York City. She replaced Sheik, who wrote the show&#x27;s music and co-wrote the lyrics with Amanda Green. In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, critic Ben Brantley called the &quot;brandy-voiced&quot; Vega &quot;a delightful, smoothly sardonic presence.&quot;

== Amanuensis Productions ==
Vega established her own recording label after the 2008 economic crisis. From that point, she stopped working for Blue Note Records and started thinking about re-recording her back catalog with new arrangements and gaining control over her works (which she eventually did with the 2014 &quot;Close-Up Series&quot;).

The name &quot;Amanuensis Productions&quot; was meant as a private joke about &quot;servant&quot; (amanuensis) owning the &quot;masters&quot; (recording masters), also a pun at A&amp;M still legally owning her previous master tapes.

Running the label proved to be harder than she expected. In 2015, it barely &quot;broke even&quot;, but new licenses were coming for &quot;Tom&#x27;s Diner&quot;.

== Personal life ==
On March 17, 1995, Vega married Mitchell Froom, a musician and a record producer (who played on and produced and &quot;Nine Objects of Desire&quot;). They have a daughter, Ruby Froom (born July 8, 1994). The alternative rock band Soul Coughing&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Ruby Vroom&quot; (1994) was named for her, with Vega&#x27;s approval. Vega and Froom separated and divorced in 1998.

On February 11, 2006, Vega married Paul Mills, a lawyer and poet, &quot;22 years after he first proposed to her.&quot;

Beginning in 2010, Ruby has occasionally performed with her mother on tour.

Vega practices Nichiren Buddhism and is a member of the American branch of the worldwide Buddhist association Soka Gakkai International.

<text>In mathematics, a semigroup is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an associative internal binary operation on it.

The binary operation of a semigroup is most often denoted multiplicatively (just notation, not necessarily the elementary arithmetic multiplication): , or simply &quot;xy&quot;, denotes the result of applying the semigroup operation to the ordered pair . Associativity is formally expressed as that for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; in the semigroup.

Semigroups may be considered a special case of magmas, where the operation is associative, or as a generalization of groups, without requiring the existence of an identity element or inverses. As in the case of groups or magmas, the semigroup operation need not be commutative, so is not necessarily equal to ; a well-known example of an operation that is associative but non-commutative is matrix multiplication. If the semigroup operation is commutative, then the semigroup is called a &quot;commutative semigroup&quot; or (less often than in the analogous case of groups) it may be called an &quot;abelian semigroup&quot;.

A monoid is an algebraic structure intermediate between semigroups and groups, and is a semigroup having an identity element, thus obeying all but one of the axioms of a group: existence of inverses is not required of a monoid. A natural example is strings with concatenation as the binary operation, and the empty string as the identity element. Restricting to non-empty strings gives an example of a semigroup that is not a monoid. Positive integers with addition form a commutative semigroup that is not a monoid, whereas the non-negative integers do form a monoid. A semigroup without an identity element can be easily turned into a monoid by just adding an identity element. Consequently, monoids are studied in the theory of semigroups rather than in group theory. Semigroups should not be confused with quasigroups, which are generalization of groups in a different direction; the operation in a quasigroup need not be associative but quasigroups preserve from groups the notion of division. Division in semigroups (or in monoids) is not possible in general.

The formal study of semigroups began in the early 20th century. Early results include a Cayley theorem for semigroups realizing any semigroup as a transformation semigroup, in which arbitrary functions replace the role of bijections in group theory. A deep result in the classification of finite semigroups is Krohn–Rhodes theory, analogous to the Jordan–Hölder decomposition for finite groups. Some other techniques for studying semigroups, like Green&#x27;s relations, do not resemble anything in group theory.

The theory of finite semigroups has been of particular importance in theoretical computer science since the 1950s because of the natural link between finite semigroups and finite automata via the syntactic monoid. In probability theory, semigroups are associated with Markov processes. In other areas of applied mathematics, semigroups are fundamental models for linear time-invariant systems. In partial differential equations, a semigroup is associated to any equation whose spatial evolution is independent of time.

There are numerous special classes of semigroups, semigroups with additional properties, which appear in particular applications. Some of these classes are even closer to groups by exhibiting some additional but not all properties of a group. Of these we mention: regular semigroups, orthodox semigroups, semigroups with involution, inverse semigroups and cancellative semigroups. There are also interesting classes of semigroups that do not contain any groups except the trivial group; examples of the latter kind are bands and their commutative subclass – semilattices, which are also ordered algebraic structures.

== Definition ==

A semigroup is a set &quot;S&quot; together with a binary operation ⋅ (that is, a function ) that satisfies the associative property:
: For all &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;, the equation holds.

More succinctly, a semigroup is an associative magma.

== Examples of semigroups ==
* Empty semigroup: the empty set forms a semigroup with the empty function as the binary operation.
* Semigroup with one element: there is essentially only one (specifically, only one up to isomorphism), the singleton {&quot;a&quot;} with operation .
* Semigroup with two elements: there are five that are essentially different.
* A null semigroup on any nonempty set with a chosen zero, or a left/right zero semigroup on any set.
* The &quot;flip-flop&quot; monoid: a semigroup with three elements representing the three operations on a switch – set, reset, and do nothing.
* The set of positive integers with addition. (With 0 included, this becomes a monoid.)
* The set of integers with minimum or maximum. (With positive/negative infinity included, this becomes a monoid.)
* Square nonnegative matrices of a given size with matrix multiplication.
* Any ideal of a ring with the multiplication of the ring.
* The set of all finite strings over a fixed alphabet Σ with concatenation of strings as the semigroup operation – the so-called &quot;free semigroup over Σ&quot;. With the empty string included, this semigroup becomes the free monoid over Σ.
* A probability distribution &quot;F&quot; together with all convolution powers of &quot;F&quot;, with convolution as the operation. This is called a convolution semigroup.
* Transformation semigroups and monoids.
* The set of continuous functions from a topological space to itself with composition of functions forms a monoid with the identity function acting as the identity. More generally, the endomorphisms of any object of a category form a monoid under composition.
* The product of faces of an arrangement of hyperplanes.

== Basic concepts ==

=== Identity and zero ===
A left identity of a semigroup &quot;S&quot; (or more generally, magma) is an element &quot;e&quot; such that for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, . Similarly, a right identity is an element &quot;f&quot; such that for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, . Left and right identities are both called one-sided identities. A semigroup may have one or more left identities but no right identity, and vice versa.

A two-sided identity (or just identity) is an element that is both a left and right identity. Semigroups with a two-sided identity are called monoids. A semigroup may have at most one two-sided identity. If a semigroup has a two-sided identity, then the two-sided identity is the only one-sided identity in the semigroup. If a semigroup has both a left identity and a right identity, then it has a two-sided identity (which is therefore the unique one-sided identity).

A semigroup &quot;S&quot; without identity may be embedded in a monoid formed by adjoining an element to &quot;S&quot; and defining for all . The notation &quot;S&quot;1 denotes a monoid obtained from &quot;S&quot; by adjoining an identity &quot;if necessary&quot; ( for a monoid).

Similarly, every magma has at most one absorbing element, which in semigroup theory is called a zero. Analogous to the above construction, for every semigroup &quot;S&quot;, one can define &quot;S&quot;0, a semigroup with 0 that embeds &quot;S&quot;.

=== Subsemigroups and ideals ===

The semigroup operation induces an operation on the collection of its subsets: given subsets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; of a semigroup &quot;S&quot;, their product , written commonly as &quot;AB&quot;, is the set (This notion is defined identically as it is for groups.) In terms of this operation, a subset &quot;A&quot; is called
* a subsemigroup if &quot;AA&quot; is a subset of &quot;A&quot;,
* a right ideal if &quot;AS&quot; is a subset of &quot;A&quot;, and
* a left ideal if &quot;SA&quot; is a subset of &quot;A&quot;.

If &quot;A&quot; is both a left ideal and a right ideal then it is called an ideal (or a two-sided ideal).

If &quot;S&quot; is a semigroup, then the intersection of any collection of subsemigroups of &quot;S&quot; is also a subsemigroup of &quot;S&quot;.
So the subsemigroups of &quot;S&quot; form a complete lattice.

An example of a semigroup with no minimal ideal is the set of positive integers under addition. The minimal ideal of a commutative semigroup, when it exists, is a group.

Green&#x27;s relations, a set of five equivalence relations that characterise the elements in terms of the principal ideals they generate, are important tools for analysing the ideals of a semigroup and related notions of structure.

The subset with the property that every element commutes with any other element of the semigroup is called the center of the semigroup. The center of a semigroup is actually a subsemigroup.

=== Homomorphisms and congruences ===

A semigroup homomorphism is a function that preserves semigroup structure. A function between two semigroups is a homomorphism if the equation
holds for all elements &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; in &quot;S&quot;, i.e. the result is the same when performing the semigroup operation after or before applying the map &quot;f&quot;.

A semigroup homomorphism between monoids preserves identity if it is a monoid homomorphism. But there are semigroup homomorphisms that are not monoid homomorphisms, e.g. the canonical embedding of a semigroup &quot;S&quot; without identity into &quot;S&quot;1. Conditions characterizing monoid homomorphisms are discussed further. Let be a semigroup homomorphism. The image of &quot;f&quot; is also a semigroup. If &quot;S&quot;0 is a monoid with an identity element &quot;e&quot;0, then &quot;f&quot;(&quot;e&quot;0) is the identity element in the image of &quot;f&quot;. If &quot;S&quot;1 is also a monoid with an identity element &quot;e&quot;1 and &quot;e&quot;1 belongs to the image of &quot;f&quot;, then , i.e. &quot;f&quot; is a monoid homomorphism. Particularly, if &quot;f&quot; is surjective, then it is a monoid homomorphism.

Two semigroups &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are said to be isomorphic if there exists a bijective semigroup homomorphism . Isomorphic semigroups have the same structure.

A semigroup congruence ~ is an equivalence relation that is compatible with the semigroup operation. That is, a subset that is an equivalence relation and and implies for every &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;v&quot; in &quot;S&quot;. Like any equivalence relation, a semigroup congruence ~ induces congruence classes
: [&quot;a&quot;]~ = 
and the semigroup operation induces a binary operation ∘ on the congruence classes:
: [&quot;u&quot;]~ ∘ [&quot;v&quot;]~ = [&quot;uv&quot;]~

Because ~ is a congruence, the set of all congruence classes of ~ forms a semigroup with ∘, called the quotient semigroup or factor semigroup, and denoted . The mapping is a semigroup homomorphism, called the quotient map, canonical surjection or projection; if &quot;S&quot; is a monoid then quotient semigroup is a monoid with identity [1]~. Conversely, the kernel of any semigroup homomorphism is a semigroup congruence. These results are nothing more than a particularization of the first isomorphism theorem in universal algebra. Congruence classes and factor monoids are the objects of study in string rewriting systems.

A nuclear congruence on &quot;S&quot; is one that is the kernel of an endomorphism of &quot;S&quot;.

A semigroup &quot;S&quot; satisfies the maximal condition on congruences if any family of congruences on &quot;S&quot;, ordered by inclusion, has a maximal element. By Zorn&#x27;s lemma, this is equivalent to saying that the ascending chain condition holds: there is no infinite strictly ascending chain of congruences on &quot;S&quot;.

Every ideal &quot;I&quot; of a semigroup induces a factor semigroup, the Rees factor semigroup, via the congruence ρ defined by if either , or both &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are in &quot;I&quot;.

=== Quotients and divisions ===
The following notions introduce the idea that a semigroup is contained in another one.

A semigroup &quot;T&quot; is a quotient of a semigroup &quot;S&quot; if there is a surjective semigroup morphism from &quot;S&quot; to &quot;T&quot;. For example, is a quotient of , using the morphism consisting of taking the remainder modulo 2 of an integer.

A semigroup &quot;T&quot; divides a semigroup &quot;S&quot;, denoted if &quot;T&quot; is a quotient of a subsemigroup &quot;S&quot;. In particular, subsemigroups of &quot;S&quot; divides &quot;T&quot;, while it is not necessarily the case that there are a quotient of &quot;S&quot;.

Both of those relations are transitive.

== Structure of semigroups ==
For any subset &quot;A&quot; of &quot;S&quot; there is a smallest subsemigroup &quot;T&quot; of &quot;S&quot; that contains &quot;A&quot;, and we say that &quot;A&quot; generates &quot;T&quot;. A single element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;S&quot; generates the subsemigroup . If this is finite, then &quot;x&quot; is said to be of finite order, otherwise it is of infinite order.
A semigroup is said to be periodic if all of its elements are of finite order.
A semigroup generated by a single element is said to be monogenic (or cyclic). If a monogenic semigroup is infinite then it is isomorphic to the semigroup of positive integers with the operation of addition.
If it is finite and nonempty, then it must contain at least one idempotent.
It follows that every nonempty periodic semigroup has at least one idempotent.

A subsemigroup that is also a group is called a subgroup. There is a close relationship between the subgroups of a semigroup and its idempotents. Each subgroup contains exactly one idempotent, namely the identity element of the subgroup. For each idempotent &quot;e&quot; of the semigroup there is a unique maximal subgroup containing &quot;e&quot;. Each maximal subgroup arises in this way, so there is a one-to-one correspondence between idempotents and maximal subgroups. Here the term &quot;maximal subgroup&quot; differs from its standard use in group theory.

More can often be said when the order is finite. For example, every nonempty finite semigroup is periodic, and has a minimal ideal and at least one idempotent. The number of finite semigroups of a given size (greater than 1) is (obviously) larger than the number of groups of the same size. For example, of the sixteen possible &quot;multiplication tables&quot; for a set of two elements , eight form semigroups whereas only four of these are monoids and only two form groups. For more on the structure of finite semigroups, see &quot;Krohn–Rhodes theory&quot;.

== Special classes of semigroups ==

* A monoid is a semigroup with an identity element.
* A group is a monoid in which every element has an inverse element.
* A subsemigroup is a subset of a semigroup that is closed under the semigroup operation.
* A cancellative semigroup is one having the cancellation property: implies and similarly for . Every group is a cancellative semigroup, and every finite cancellative semigroup is a group.
* A band is a semigroup whose operation is idempotent.
* A semilattice is a semigroup whose operation is idempotent and commutative.
* 0-simple semigroups.
* Transformation semigroups: any finite semigroup &quot;S&quot; can be represented by transformations of a (state-) set &quot;Q&quot; of at most states. Each element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;S&quot; then maps &quot;Q&quot; into itself and sequence &quot;xy&quot; is defined by for each &quot;q&quot; in &quot;Q&quot;. Sequencing clearly is an associative operation, here equivalent to function composition. This representation is basic for any automaton or finite-state machine (FSM).
* The bicyclic semigroup is in fact a monoid, which can be described as the free semigroup on two generators &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;, under the relation .
* C0-semigroups.
* Regular semigroups. Every element &quot;x&quot; has at least one inverse &quot;y&quot; that satisfies and ; the elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are sometimes called &quot;mutually inverse&quot;.
* Inverse semigroups are regular semigroups where every element has exactly one inverse. Alternatively, a regular semigroup is inverse if and only if any two idempotents commute.
* Affine semigroup: a semigroup that is isomorphic to a finitely-generated subsemigroup of Zd. These semigroups have applications to commutative algebra.

== Structure theorem for commutative semigroups ==

There is a structure theorem for commutative semigroups in terms of semilattices. A semilattice (or more precisely a meet-semilattice) is a partially ordered set where every pair of elements has a greatest lower bound, denoted . The operation ∧ makes &quot;L&quot; into a semigroup that satisfies the additional idempotence law .

Given a homomorphism from an arbitrary semigroup to a semilattice, each inverse image is a (possibly empty) semigroup. Moreover, &quot;S&quot; becomes graded by &quot;L&quot;, in the sense that .

If &quot;f&quot; is onto, the semilattice &quot;L&quot; is isomorphic to the quotient of &quot;S&quot; by the equivalence relation ~ such that if and only if . This equivalence relation is a semigroup congruence, as defined above.

Whenever we take the quotient of a commutative semigroup by a congruence, we get another commutative semigroup. The structure theorem says that for any commutative semigroup &quot;S&quot;, there is a finest congruence ~ such that the quotient of &quot;S&quot; by this equivalence relation is a semilattice. Denoting this semilattice by &quot;L&quot;, we get a homomorphism &quot;f&quot; from &quot;S&quot; onto &quot;L&quot;. As mentioned, &quot;S&quot; becomes graded by this semilattice.

Furthermore, the components &quot;S&quot;&quot;a&quot; are all Archimedean semigroups. An Archimedean semigroup is one where given any pair of elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y &quot;, there exists an element &quot;z&quot; and such that .

The Archimedean property follows immediately from the ordering in the semilattice &quot;L&quot;, since with this ordering we have if and only if for some &quot;z&quot; and .

== Group of fractions ==
The group of fractions or group completion of a semigroup &quot;S&quot; is the group generated by the elements of &quot;S&quot; as generators and all equations that hold true in &quot;S&quot; as relations. There is an obvious semigroup homomorphism that sends each element of &quot;S&quot; to the corresponding generator. This has a universal property for morphisms from &quot;S&quot; to a group: given any group &quot;H&quot; and any semigroup homomorphism , there exists a unique group homomorphism with . We may think of &quot;G&quot; as the &quot;most general&quot; group that contains a homomorphic image of &quot;S&quot;.

An important question is to characterize those semigroups for which this map is an embedding. This need not always be the case: for example, take &quot;S&quot; to be the semigroup of subsets of some set &quot;X&quot; with set-theoretic intersection as the binary operation (this is an example of a semilattice). Since holds for all elements of &quot;S&quot;, this must be true for all generators of &quot;G&quot;(&quot;S&quot;) as well, which is therefore the trivial group. It is clearly necessary for embeddability that &quot;S&quot; have the cancellation property. When &quot;S&quot; is commutative this condition is also sufficient and the Grothendieck group of the semigroup provides a construction of the group of fractions. The problem for non-commutative semigroups can be traced to the first substantial paper on semigroups. Anatoly Maltsev gave necessary and sufficient conditions for embeddability in 1937.

== Semigroup methods in partial differential equations ==
Semigroup theory can be used to study some problems in the field of partial differential equations. Roughly speaking, the semigroup approach is to regard a time-dependent partial differential equation as an ordinary differential equation on a function space. For example, consider the following initial/boundary value problem for the heat equation on the spatial interval and times :
: formula_1

Let be the &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; space of square-integrable real-valued functions with domain the interval and let &quot;A&quot; be the second-derivative operator with domain
: formula_2
where formula_3 is a Sobolev space. Then the above initial/boundary value problem can be interpreted as an initial value problem for an ordinary differential equation on the space &quot;X&quot;:
: formula_4

On an heuristic level, the solution to this problem &quot;ought&quot; to be
formula_5
However, for a rigorous treatment, a meaning must be given to the exponential of &quot;tA&quot;. As a function of &quot;t&quot;, exp(&quot;tA&quot;) is a semigroup of operators from &quot;X&quot; to itself, taking the initial state &quot;u&quot;0 at time to the state at time &quot;t&quot;. The operator &quot;A&quot; is said to be the infinitesimal generator of the semigroup.

== History ==
The study of semigroups trailed behind that of other algebraic structures with more complex axioms such as groups or rings. A number of sources attribute the first use of the term (in French) to J.-A. de Séguier in &quot;Élements de la Théorie des Groupes Abstraits&quot; (Elements of the Theory of Abstract Groups) in 1904. The term is used in English in 1908 in Harold Hinton&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Groups of Finite Order&quot;.

Anton Sushkevich obtained the first non-trivial results about semigroups. His 1928 paper &quot;Über die endlichen Gruppen ohne das Gesetz der eindeutigen Umkehrbarkeit&quot; (&quot;On finite groups without the rule of unique invertibility&quot;) determined the structure of finite simple semigroups and showed that the minimal ideal (or Green&#x27;s relations J-class) of a finite semigroup is simple. From that point on, the foundations of semigroup theory were further laid by David Rees, James Alexander Green, , Alfred H. Clifford and Gordon Preston. The latter two published a two-volume monograph on semigroup theory in 1961 and 1967 respectively. In 1970, a new periodical called &quot;Semigroup Forum&quot; (currently published by Springer Verlag) became one of the few mathematical journals devoted entirely to semigroup theory.

The representation theory of semigroups was developed in 1963 by Boris Schein using binary relations on a set &quot;A&quot; and composition of relations for the semigroup product. At an algebraic conference in 1972 Schein surveyed the literature on B&quot;A&quot;, the semigroup of relations on &quot;A&quot;. In 1997 Schein and Ralph McKenzie proved that every semigroup is isomorphic to a transitive semigroup of binary relations.

In recent years researchers in the field have become more specialized with dedicated monographs appearing on important classes of semigroups, like inverse semigroups, as well as monographs focusing on applications in algebraic automata theory, particularly for finite automata, and also in functional analysis.

== Generalizations ==

If the associativity axiom of a semigroup is dropped, the result is a magma, which is nothing more than a set &quot;M&quot; equipped with a binary operation that is closed .

Generalizing in a different direction, an n&quot;-ary semigroup (also n&quot;-semigroup, polyadic semigroup or multiary semigroup) is a generalization of a semigroup to a set &quot;G&quot; with a &quot;n&quot;-ary operation instead of a binary operation. The associative law is generalized as follows: ternary associativity is , i.e. the string &quot;abcde&quot; with any three adjacent elements bracketed. &quot;n&quot;-ary associativity is a string of length with any &quot;n&quot; adjacent elements bracketed. A 2-ary semigroup is just a semigroup. Further axioms lead to an &quot;n&quot;-ary group.

A third generalization is the semigroupoid, in which the requirement that the binary relation be total is lifted. As categories generalize monoids in the same way, a semigroupoid behaves much like a category but lacks identities.

Infinitary generalizations of commutative semigroups have sometimes been considered by various authors.

<doc id="27801" wikidata="Q1061560" url="?curid=27801" title="Super Mario Kart">
<text>is a 1992 kart racing game developed and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The first game in the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series, it was released in Japan and North America in 1992, and in Europe the following year in 1993. Selling 8.76 million copies worldwide, the game went on to become the fourth best-selling SNES game of all time. &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; was re-released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2009, on the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2013, and on the New Nintendo 3DS&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2016. Nintendo re-released &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; in 2017 as part of the company&#x27;s Super NES Classic Edition.

In &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;, the player takes control of one of eight &quot;Mario&quot; series characters, each with differing capabilities. In single player mode players can race against computer-controlled characters in 4 multi-race cups consisting of 20 tracks (5 in each cup) over three difficulty levels (50cc, 100cc and 150cc). During the races, offensive and speed boosting power-ups can be used to gain an advantage. Alternatively players can race against the clock in a Time Trial mode. In multiplayer mode two players can simultaneously take part in the cups or can race against each other one-on-one in Match Race mode. In a third multiplayer mode – Battle Mode – the aim is to defeat the other players by attacking them with power-ups, destroying balloons which surround each kart.

&quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; received positive reviews and was praised for its presentation, innovation and use of Mode 7 graphics. It has been ranked among the greatest video games of all time by several magazines and organizations. It is often credited with creating the kart-racing subgenre of video games, leading other developers to try to duplicate its success. The game is seen as having been key to expanding the &quot;Mario&quot; series into non-platforming games; this diversity has led to it becoming the best-selling game franchise of all time. Several sequels to &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; have been released, for consoles, handhelds and in arcades, each enjoying critical and commercial success. While some elements have developed throughout the series, the core experience from &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; has remained intact.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; is a kart racing game featuring several single and multiplayer modes. During the game, players take control of one of eight &quot;Mario&quot; franchise characters, each with differing capabilities, and drive karts around tracks with a &quot;Mario&quot; franchise theme. In order for them to begin driving, Lakitu appears with a traffic light hanging on his fishing pole at the starting line, which starts the countdown. When the light turns green, the race or battle begins. During a race, the player&#x27;s viewpoint is from behind their kart. The goal of the game is to either finish a race ahead of other racers, who are controlled by the computer and other players, or complete a circuit in the fastest time. There is a battle mode in which the aim is to attack the karts of the other human players.

Some tracks feature chevron-shaped boost panels to increase speed for a brief moment. In addition, there are also short ramps that cause racers to jump when driven over. A combination of the two makes the player jump higher and a high speed.

Tiles marked with question marks are arrayed on the race tracks; they give special abilities (power-ups) to a player&#x27;s kart if the vehicle passes over them. Power-ups, such as the ability to throw shells and bananas, allow racers to hit others with the objects, causing them to spin and lose control. A kart that obtains the star power-up is temporarily invincible. Computer players have specific special powers associated with each character that they are able to use throughout the race. Lines of coins are found on the tracks in competitive race modes. By running over these coins, a kart collects them and increases its top speed. Having coins helps players when their kart is hit by another: instead of spinning and losing control, they lose a coin. Coins are lost when karts are struck by power-ups or fall off the tracks.

The game features advanced maneuvers such as power sliding and hopping. Power sliding allows a kart to maintain its speed while turning, although executing the maneuver for too long causes the kart to spin. Hopping helps a kart execute tighter turns: the kart makes a short hop and turns in the air, speeding off in the new direction when it lands. Reviewers praised &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;″s gameplay, describing the battle mode as &quot;addictive&quot; and the single player gameplay as &quot;incredible&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; stated that the gameplay mechanics defined the genre.

===Modes===

&quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; has two single-player modes: Mario Kart GP (which stands for Grand Prix) and Time Trial. In Mario Kart GP, one player is required to race against seven computer-controlled characters in a series of five races which are called cups. Initially, there are three cups available – the Mushroom Cup, Flower Cup, and Star Cup – at two difficulty levels, 50cc and 100cc. By winning all three of the cups at the 100cc level, a fourth cup – the Special Cup – is unlocked. Winning all four cups at 100cc unlocks a new difficulty level, 150cc. Each cup consists of five five-lap races, each taking place on a distinct track. In order to continue through a cup, a position of fourth or higher must be achieved in each race. If a player finishes in the fifth to eighth position, they are &quot;ranked out&quot; and the race must be replayed – at the cost of one of a limited number of lives – until a placing of fourth or above is achieved. If the player has no lives when they rank out, the game is over. Points are accrued by finishing in the top four positions in a race; first to fourth place receive nine, six, three and one points. If a player finishes in the same position three times in a row, then an extra life is awarded. The finishing order for that race will then become the starting grid for the next race; for example, if a player finishes in first place, then that player will start the next race in the same position. The racer with the highest number of points after all five races have been completed wins the cup. In time trial mode, players race against the clock through the same tracks that are present in Mario Kart GP mode, attempting to set the fastest time possible.

&quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; has three multiplayer modes; Mario Kart GP, Match Race, and Battle Mode. The multiplayer modes support two players and the second player uses the bottom half of the screen which is used as a map in the single-player modes. Mario Kart GP is the same as in single-player, the only difference being that there are two human-controlled and six computer-controlled drivers. Match Race involves the two players going head to head on a track of their choice without any opponents. In Battle Mode, the two players again go head to head, but this time in one of four dedicated Battle Mode courses. Each player starts with three balloons around their kart which can be popped by power-ups fired by the other player. The first player to have all three of their balloons popped loses.

===Characters===
&quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; features eight playable characters from the &quot;Mario&quot; series – Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Yoshi, Bowser, Donkey Kong Jr., Koopa Troopa and Toad. Each character&#x27;s kart has different capabilities with differing levels of top speed, acceleration and handling. During races, computer-controlled characters have special items, or superpowers, which they are able to use. These powers are specific to each character; for example, Yoshi drops eggs which cause players who hit them to lose coins and spin, while Donkey Kong Jr. throws bananas.

The characters are rendered as sprites portrayed from sixteen different angles. In 2005, Nintendojo called the sprites &quot;not-so-pretty&quot; when they are rendered at a distance, and &quot;IGN&quot; has commented on the dated look of the game. &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; was the first game to feature playable characters from the &quot;Mario&quot; series other than Mario or Luigi in a non-platforming game and the selection and different attributes of the characters is regarded as one of the game&#x27;s strengths, &quot;IGN&quot; describing a well-balanced &quot;all-star cast&quot;. All of the characters present in &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; have gone on to appear in later games in the series, except for Donkey Kong Jr. and Koopa Troopa, who have only appeared intermittently after being replaced by Donkey Kong and Wario respectively in &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;.

===Tracks===
The tracks in &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; are based on locations in &quot;Super Mario World&quot; such as Donut Plains. Each of the four cups contains five different tracks for a total of twenty unique tracks, additionally there are four unique Battle Mode courses. The course outlines are marked out by impassable barriers and feature a variety of bends ranging from sharp hairpins to wide curves which players can power slide around. Numerous obstacles themed from the &quot;Mario&quot; series appear, such as Thwomps in the Bowser&#x27;s Castle tracks, the Cheep-Cheeps from &quot;Super Mario World&quot; in Koopa Beach and pipe barriers which are found in the Mario Circuit tracks. Other features include off-road sections which slow down the karts such as the mud bogs in the Choco Island tracks. Each cup track is littered with coins and power-up tiles, as well as turbo tiles which give the karts a boost of speed and jumps which launch the karts into the air.

The tracks have received positive commentary, with GameSpy describing them as wonderfully designed and &quot;IGN&quot; calling them perfect. When naming its top five &quot;Mario Kart&quot; tracks of all time in 2008, &quot;1UP.com&quot; named Battle Mode Course 4 at number three and Rainbow Road – along with its subsequent versions in the series – at number one. The track themes in &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; influenced later games in the series; recurring themes that first appeared in &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; include haunted tracks, Bowser&#x27;s Castle and Rainbow Road. Some of the tracks from &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; have been duplicated in later games. All twenty of the original tracks are unlockable as an extra feature in the Game Boy Advance title &quot;Mario Kart: Super Circuit&quot;. Remakes of Mario Circuit 1, Donut Plains 1, Koopa Beach 2 and Choco Island 2 appear as part of the Retro Grand Prix series in &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;, remakes of Ghost Valley 2, Mario Circuit 3, and Battle Course 4 appear as part of the Retro Grand Prix and battles in &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot;, remakes of Mario Circuit 2 and Rainbow Road appear as part of the Retro Grand Prix in &quot;Mario Kart 7&quot;, a remake of Donut Plains 3 appears as part of the Retro Grand Prix and battles in &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot;, a second remake of Rainbow Road appears in &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot;″s first downloadable content pack, a remake of Battle Course 1 appears as a Retro Battle Course in &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot;, and remakes of Mario Circuit 3 and Bowser Castle 3 appear in the second and sixth waves respectively of &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot;″s Booster Course Pass.

==Development==

&quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; was produced by &quot;Mario&quot; creator Shigeru Miyamoto and directed by Tadashi Sugiyama and Hideki Konno. The development team set out to produce a racing game capable of displaying two players on the same game screen simultaneously, in contrast to the single-player gameplay &quot;F-Zero&quot;. This led to simpler tracks than those of &quot;F-Zero&quot;. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; suggest that this initial emphasis on creating a two player experience is the reason for the game&#x27;s horizontal split-screen during single-player. Battle Mode was developed from the desire to create a one-on-one mode where victory was not determined simply by competing for rank. Masato Kimura, who worked on &quot;F-Zero&quot;, served as the lead programmer for &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;.

The game did not start out as a &quot;Mario&quot; series game and the first prototype featured a generic kart racer character; the team decided that characters three heads tall would best suit the design of the karts. They did not decide to incorporate &quot;Mario&quot; characters until a few months into development. The choice was made after the development team observed how one kart looked to another driving past it, decided to see what it would look like with Mario in the kart. Thinking that having Mario in the kart looked better than previous designs, the idea of a Mario themed racing game was born.

Notable in the development of &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; was its use of Mode 7 graphics. First seen in &quot;F-Zero&quot;, Mode 7 is a form of texture mapping available on the SNES which allows a plane to be rotated and scaled freely, achieving a pseudo-three-dimensional appearance. &quot;1UP.com&quot; have credited the use of Mode 7 with giving the game graphics which at the time of release were considered to be &quot;breathtaking&quot;. Retrospective reflection on the Mode 7 visuals was mixed, with &quot;IGN&quot; stating that the once revolutionary technology now looks &quot;crude and flickery&quot;. &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; featured a DSP (Digital Signal Processor) chip; DSPs were used in SNES games as they provided a better handling of floating point calculations to assist with three-dimensional maths. The DSP-1 chip that was used in &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; went on to be the most popular DSP chip to be used in SNES games. The music for the game was created by composer Soyo Oka, who previously composed games for Nintendo such as &quot;Pilotwings&quot; and &quot;Ice Hockey&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; received critical acclaim and proved to be a commercial success; it received a Player&#x27;s Choice release after selling one million copies and went on to sell 8.76 million copies worldwide, becoming the fourth best-selling game ever for the SNES. In Japan, it was the top-selling game in September 1992 and became a multi-million seller in 1992, eventually selling a total of in Japan. In Europe, it was the top-selling game during the first quarter of 1993, above the Sega Mega Drive titles &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&quot; and &quot;Streets of Rage 2&quot; during the same period. In the United Kingdom, &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; was the top-selling Super NES game in February 1993, and it went on to be the seventh best-selling game of 1993 with more than 250,000 sales in the country.

Aggregate scoring sites GameRankings and MobyGames both give an average of more than 90 percent. Critics praised the game&#x27;s Mode 7 graphics. Another aspect of the game to have been praised is its gameplay, which &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; has described as the &quot;deepest [and] most addictive... to be found on the SNES console&quot;. Retrospective reviews of the game have been positive with perfect scores given by review sites including &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; and &quot;HonestGamers&quot;. The use of the style and characters from the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise was also praised as well as the individual characteristics of each racer. &quot;Mean Machines&quot; described the game as having &quot;struck gold&quot; in a way that no other – not even its sequels – has matched and &quot;GameSpot&quot; named the game as one of the greatest games of all time for its innovation, gameplay and visual style. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that although the game might appear to be a &quot;cynical attempt by Nintendo to cash in on its &quot;Super Mario&quot; franchise&quot; the review concluded that &quot;plunking the familiar characters down in souped-up go-carts actually makes for a delightful racing game.&quot; &quot;GamePro&quot; said the game &quot;does an excellent job of capturing the thrill of Go-cart racing, and wraps it up in the familiar, fun, &quot;Mario&quot;-land atmosphere.&quot; The reviewer also praised the use of Mode 7 and challenging CPU-controlled opponents.

&quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; has been listed among the best games ever made several times. In 1995, &quot;Total!&quot; rated the game 16th on its &quot;Top 100 SNES Games.&quot; In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed it as number 37 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that the controls are elegantly designed to offer &quot;supreme fun&quot;. In 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; ranked the game 16th on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;. In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; as number 7 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting that, &quot;Imitated a thousand times, but never, ever, equalled, &quot;Mario Kart&quot; changed the rules for the driving game and gave the world one of the most engrossing and addictive two-player experiences ever&quot;. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; ranked it as the 15th best console video game of all time, attributing its higher ranking than &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; (which came in 49th) to its superior track design and powerups. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked it as the 15th best game ever in 2005, describing it as &quot;the original karting masterpiece&quot; and as the 23rd best game ever in 2007, discussing its originality at time of release. &quot;The Age&quot; placed it at number 19 on their list of the 50 best games in 2005 and in 2007 &quot;Edge&quot; ranked &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; at number 14 on a list of their 100 best games, noting its continued influence on video game design. The game is included in Yahoo! Games UK&#x27;s list of the hundred greatest games of all time which praises the appealing characters and power ups and &quot;1UP.com&quot;″s &quot;Essential 50&quot;, a list of the fifty most important games ever made. The game placed 13th in &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot;″s 100 greatest Nintendo games of all time. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; ranked it at number 1 on a list of the top 50 console games of all time based on initial impact and lasting legacy. &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked the game at 35 on their top 100 games of all time in 2001 praising how the game&#x27;s Mode 7 revolutionized racing games. In 2018, &quot;Complex&quot; listed &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; seventh on its &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;. In 2019, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; to its World Video Game Hall of Fame.

==Legacy==

&quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; has been credited with inventing the &quot;kart racing&quot; subgenre of video gaming; after its release, several other developers attempted to duplicate its success. In 1994, less than two years after the release of &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;, Sega released &quot;Sonic Drift&quot;; a kart racing game featuring characters from the &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; series. Also in 1994, Ubisoft released &quot;Street Racer&quot;, a kart racing game for the SNES and Mega Drive/Genesis which included a four player mode not present in &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;. Apogee Software released &quot;Wacky Wheels&quot; for PC and Atari Corporation released &quot;Atari Karts&quot; for the Atari Jaguar in 1995. Future games that followed in the mould of &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; include &quot;South Park Rally&quot;, &quot;Konami Krazy Racers&quot;, &quot;Diddy Kong Racing&quot;, &quot;Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing&quot; and several racing games in the &quot;Crash Bandicoot&quot; series. Response to the karting games released since &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; has been mixed, with &quot;GameSpot&quot; describing them as tending to be bad while &quot;1UP.com&quot; notes that countless developers have tried to improve upon the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; formula without success.

&quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; is credited as being the first non-platforming game to feature multiple playable characters from the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise. As well as several sequels Nintendo has released numerous other sporting and non-sporting Mario spin-offs since &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;; a trend in part accredited to the commercial and critical success of the game. The &quot;Mario&quot; characters have appeared in many sports games including those relating to basketball, baseball, golf, tennis, and association football (soccer). Non-sporting franchises using the &quot;Mario&quot; characters have been created, including the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series of fighting games and the &quot;Mario Party&quot; series of board game-based party games. &quot;Mario&quot; series characters have made cameos in games from other series such as &quot;SSX on Tour&quot; and &quot;NBA Street V3&quot;, both published by EA Sports. The genre-spanning nature of the &quot;Mario&quot; series that was sparked off by the success of &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; has been described as key to the success and longevity of the franchise; keeping people interested despite the infrequency of traditional &quot;Mario&quot; platforming games. Following this model the &quot;Mario&quot; series has gone on to become the best selling video game franchise of all time with 193 million units sold as of January 2007, almost 40 million units ahead of second-ranked franchise &quot;Pokémon&quot;, also by Nintendo.

&quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; was re-released on the Japanese Virtual Console on June 9, 2009, and later in North America on November 23, 2009. Previously, when naming it as one of the most wanted games for the platform in November 2008, &quot;Eurogamer&quot; stated that problems emulating the Mode 7 graphics were responsible for its absence.

The game was released for the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan during June 2013, and in Europe on March 27, 2014. In addition, North American users were able to get the game starting from August 6, 2014 to celebrate the 22nd anniversary of the game, which included the new game update of &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot; on August 27, 2014.

In 2016, the game was re-released for the New Nintendo 3DS.

Nintendo re-released &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; in 2017 as part of the company&#x27;s Super NES Classic Edition.

&quot;Super Mario 3D World&quot; has a stage with a look based on the Mario Circuit racetracks from &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;. A remixed version of the music can be heard. &quot;Super Mario Odyssey&quot; has a remix, when racing an RC car around a track in New Donk City in the Metro Kingdom.

Several future &quot;Mario Kart&quot; games contain re-imaginings of courses from &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;. &quot;Mario Kart: Super Circuit&quot; contains all of them, though they need to be unlocked. &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot; contains remakes of the Mario Circuit 1, Donut Plains 1, Koopa Beach 2, and Choco Island 2 courses. &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot; has remakes of the Ghost Valley 2 and Mario Circuit 3 courses. &quot;Mario Kart 7&quot; has remakes of the Mario Circuit 2 and Rainbow Road courses. The most recent entry, &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot;, has remakes of the Donut Plains 3 and Rainbow Road courses, though the latter is only available as downloadable content in the original release. The enhanced Nintendo Switch port of &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot;, later added remakes of the Mario Circuit 3 and Bowser Castle 3 courses as downloadable content.

===Sequels===

Several sequels to &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; have been released for successive generations of Nintendo consoles, each receiving commercial success and critical acclaim. While some elements have developed throughout the series, the core experience from &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; has remained intact. The first sequel, &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;, was released in 1996 for the Nintendo 64 and was the first &quot;Mario Kart&quot; game to feature fully 3D graphics. Although reviewers including &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot; felt that the single-player gameplay was lacking compared to its predecessor, the simultaneous four-person multiplayer modes – a first for the Nintendo 64 – were praised. The second sequel, &quot;Mario Kart: Super Circuit&quot;, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2001. It was described by &quot;GameSpot&quot; as more of a remake of &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; than a sequel to &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; and featured a return to the graphical style of the original. As well as featuring new tracks, players are able to unlock the original SNES tracks if certain achievements are completed. &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash&quot; was released for the GameCube in 2003. Unlike any other &quot;Mario Kart&quot; game before or since, it features two riders in each kart, allowing for a new form of cooperative multiplayer where one player controls the kart&#x27;s movement and the other fires weapons. &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;, released for the Nintendo DS in 2005, was the first &quot;Mario Kart&quot; game to include online play via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. It went on to become the best selling handheld racing game of all time, selling 7.83 million units. The game marks the debut of tracks appearing in previous games. &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot; was released for the Wii in 2008 and incorporates motion controls and 12-player racing. Like &quot;Mario Kart DS&quot;, it includes online play; it allows racers to play as user-created Miis (after unlocking the Mii character) as well as &quot;Mario&quot; series characters and comes packaged with the Wii Wheel peripheral, which can act as the game&#x27;s primary control mechanism when coupled with a Wii Remote. &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot; went on to be the worldwide best-selling game of 2008. &quot;Mario Kart 7&quot; for the Nintendo 3DS was released in 2011, which features racing on land, sea, and air. &quot;Mario Kart 7&quot; added the ability to customize the kart and to race in first-person mode. Three &quot;Mario Kart&quot; arcade games have been released, &quot;Mario Kart Arcade GP&quot; in 2005, &quot;Mario Kart Arcade GP 2&quot; in 2007, and &quot;Mario Kart Arcade GP DX&quot; in 2013. All of them were developed jointly by Nintendo and Namco and feature Namco characters including Pac-Man and Blinky. The most recent entry in the series is &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot; for the Wii U, which was released at the end of May 2014, which brings back gliders and propellers from &quot;Mario Kart 7&quot; as well as 12-player racing in &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot;. &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot; includes a new feature called Mario Kart TV, where players can watch highlights of previous races and uploading them to YouTube. Another new feature is anti-gravity racing, where players can race on walls and ceilings. An enhanced port, &quot;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&quot;, was released on the Nintendo Switch on April 28, 2017. The game keeps most elements from the Wii U version, while adding more characters, kart parts, battle modes, and battle stages. The port received universal critical acclaim, and has sold over 61 million copies as of March 2024, becoming the best selling game for the console. Furthermore, the number of copies sold exceeded that of &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, released on the Nintendo Entertainment System, making it the first &quot;Mario&quot; title to outsell a previous instalment.

As the series has progressed, many aspects included in &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; have been developed and altered. The power-up boxes which are flat against the track in &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; due to the technical limitations of the SNES became floating boxes in later games. The roster of racers has expanded in recent games to include a greater selection of Nintendo characters including some which had not been created at the time of &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;″s release – such as Petey Piranha from &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot; who appeared in &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash!!&quot;. Multiplayer has remained a key feature of the series and has expanded from the two-player modes available in &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot;: first to allow up to four simultaneous players in split-screen in &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot;; then leveraging the GameCube&#x27;s LAN Adapter for up to sixteen players in &quot;Mario Kart Double Dash!!&quot;; and eventually supporting up to twelve simultaneous online players in &quot;Mario Kart Wii&quot;. Many of the track themes have been retained throughout the series, including Rainbow Road – the final track of the Special Cup – which has appeared in every &quot;Mario Kart&quot; console game. Other features present in &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; have disappeared from the series. These include the &quot;superpowers&quot; of the computer characters, the feather power-up which allows players to jump high into the air and having a restricted number of lives. The only other &quot;Mario Kart&quot; games to feature the coin collecting of the original are &quot;Mario Kart: Super Circuit&quot;, &quot;Mario Kart 7&quot;, and &quot;Mario Kart 8&quot;. The aspects of style and gameplay from &quot;Super Mario Kart&quot; that have been retained throughout the series have led Nintendo to face criticism for a lack of originality but the franchise is still considered to be a beloved household name by many, known for its familiar core gameplay.

<text>Seymour Aubrey Papert (; 29 February 1928 – 31 July 2016) was a South African-born American mathematician, computer scientist, and educator, who spent most of his career teaching and researching at MIT. He was one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence, and of the constructionist movement in education. He was co-inventor, with Wally Feurzeig and Cynthia Solomon, of the Logo programming language.

==Early years and education==
Born to a Jewish family, Papert attended the University of the Witwatersrand, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in philosophy in 1949 followed by a PhD in mathematics in 1952. He then went on to receive a second doctorate, also in mathematics, at the University of Cambridge (1959), supervised by Frank Smithies.

==Career==
Papert worked as a researcher in a variety of places, including St. John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, the Henri Poincaré Institute at the University of Paris, the University of Geneva, and the National Physical Laboratory in London before becoming a research associate at MIT in 1963. He held this position until 1967, when he became professor of applied math and was made co-director of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by its founding director Professor Marvin Minsky, until 1981; he also served as Cecil and Ida Green professor of education at MIT from 1974 to 1981.

==Research==
Papert worked on learning theories, and was known for focusing on the impact of new technologies on learning in general, and in schools as learning organizations in particular.

===Constructionism===
At MIT, Papert went on to create the Epistemology and Learning Research Group at the MIT Architecture Machine Group which later became the MIT Media Lab. Here, he was the developer of a theory on learning called constructionism, built upon the work of Jean Piaget in constructivist learning theories. Papert had worked with Piaget at the University of Geneva from 1958 to 1963 and was one of Piaget&#x27;s protégés; Piaget himself once said that &quot;no one understands my ideas as well as Papert&quot;. Papert has rethought how schools should work, based on these theories of learning.

===Logo===
Papert used Piaget&#x27;s work in his development of the Logo programming language while at MIT. He created Logo as a tool to improve the way children think and solve problems. A small mobile robot called the &quot;Logo Turtle&quot; was developed, and children were shown how to use it to solve simple problems in an environment of play. A main purpose of the Logo Foundation research group is to strengthen the ability to learn knowledge. Papert insisted a simple language or program that children can learn—like Logo—can also have advanced functionality for expert users.

===Other work===
As part of his work with technology, Papert has been a proponent of the Knowledge Machine. He was one of the principals for the One Laptop Per Child initiative to manufacture and distribute The Children&#x27;s Machine in developing nations.

Papert also collaborated with the construction toy manufacturer Lego on their Logo-programmable Lego Mindstorms robotics kits, which were named after his groundbreaking 1980 book.

A curated archive of Papert&#x27;s articles, speeches, and interviews may be found on a website dedicated to Papert at: The Daily Papert.

==Personal life==
Papert became a political and anti-apartheid activist early in his life in South Africa. He subsequently chose self exile. He was a leading figure in the revolutionary socialist circle around &quot;Socialist Review&quot; while living in London in the 1950s. Papert was also a prominent activist against South African apartheid policies during his university education.

Papert was married to Dona Strauss, and later to Androula Christofides Henriques.

Papert&#x27;s third wife was MIT professor Sherry Turkle, and together they wrote the influential paper &quot;Epistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete&quot;.

In his final 24 years, Papert was married to Suzanne Massie, who is a Russian scholar and author of &quot;Pavlovsk: The Life of a Russian Palace&quot; and &quot;Land of the Firebird&quot;.

===Accident in Hanoi===
Papert (then aged 78), received a serious brain injury when struck by a motor scooter on 5 December 2006 while crossing the street with colleague Uri Wilensky when they were both attending the 17th International Commission on Mathematical Instruction (ICMI) Study conference in Hanoi, Vietnam. He underwent emergency surgery to remove a blood clot at the French Hospital of Hanoi before being transferred in a complex operation by Swiss Air Ambulance (REGA ) Bombardier Challenger Jet to Boston, Massachusetts, where he spent approximately four weeks in intensive care. He was moved to a hospital closer to his home in January 2007, but then developed sepsis which damaged a heart valve, which was later replaced.

By 2008 he had returned home, could think and communicate clearly and walk &quot;almost unaided&quot;, but still had &quot;some complicated speech problems&quot; and was in receipt of extensive rehabilitation support. His rehabilitation team used some of the very principles of experiential, hands-on learning that he had pioneered.

Papert died at his home in Blue Hill, Maine, on 31 July 2016.

==Awards, honours, and legacy==
Papert&#x27;s work has been used by other researchers in the fields of education and computer science. He influenced the work of Uri Wilensky in the design of NetLogo and collaborated with him on the study of knowledge restructurations, as well as the work of Andrea diSessa and the development of &quot;dynaturtles&quot;. In 1981, Papert along with several others in the Logo group at MIT, started Logo Computer Systems Inc. (LCSI), of which he was board chair for over 20 years. Working with LCSI, Papert designed a number of award-winning programs, including LogoWriter and Lego/Logo (marketed as Lego Mindstorms). He also influenced the research of Idit Harel Caperton, coauthoring articles and the book &quot;Constructionism&quot;, and chairing the advisory board of the company MaMaMedia. He also influenced Alan Kay and the Dynabook concept, and worked with Kay on various projects.

Papert won a Guggenheim fellowship in 1980, a Marconi International fellowship in 1981, the Software Publishers Association Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994, and the Smithsonian Award from &quot;Computerworld&quot; in 1997. Papert has been called by Marvin Minsky &quot;the greatest living mathematics educator&quot;.

MIT President L. Rafael Reif summarized Papert&#x27;s lifetime of accomplishments: &quot;With a mind of extraordinary range and creativity, Seymour Papert helped revolutionize at least three fields, from the study of how children make sense of the world, to the development of artificial intelligence, to the rich intersection of technology and learning. The stamp he left on MIT is profound. Today, as MIT continues to expand its reach and deepen its work in digital learning, I am particularly grateful for Seymour&#x27;s groundbreaking vision, and we hope to build on his ideas to open doors to learners of all ages, around the world.&quot;

In 2016 Papert&#x27;s alma mater, University of Witwatersrand, awarded him the degree of &quot;Doctor of Science in Engineering, honoris causa&quot;.

<text>In computing, a search engine is an information retrieval software system designed to help find information stored on one or more computer systems. Search engines discover, crawl, transform, and store information for retrieval and presentation in response to user queries. The search results are usually presented in a list and are commonly called &quot;hits&quot;. The most widely used type of search engine is a web search engine, which searches for information on the World Wide Web.

A search engine normally consists of four components, as follows: a search interface, a crawler (also known as a spider or bot), an indexer, and a database. The crawler traverses a document collection, deconstructs document text, and assigns surrogates for storage in the search engine index. Online search engines store images, link data and metadata for the document.

==How search engines work==
Search engines provide an interface to a group of items that enables users to specify criteria about an item of interest and have the engine find the matching items. The criteria are referred to as a search query. In the case of text search engines, the search query is typically expressed as a set of words that identify the desired concept that one or more documents may contain. There are several styles of search query syntax that vary in strictness. It can also switch names within the search engines from previous sites. Whereas some text search engines require users to enter two or three words separated by white space, other search engines may enable users to specify entire documents, pictures, sounds, and various forms of natural language. Some search engines apply improvements to search queries to increase the likelihood of providing a quality set of items through a process known as query expansion. Query understanding methods can be used as standardized query language.

The list of items that meet the criteria specified by the query is typically sorted, or ranked. Ranking items by relevance (from highest to lowest) reduces the time required to find the desired information. Probabilistic search engines rank items based on measures of similarity (between each item and the query, typically on a scale of 1 to 0, 1 being most similar) and sometimes popularity or authority (see Bibliometrics) or use relevance feedback. Boolean search engines typically only return items which match exactly without regard to order, although the term &quot;Boolean search engine&quot; may simply refer to the use of Boolean-style syntax (the use of operators AND, OR, NOT, and XOR) in a probabilistic context.

To provide a set of matching items that are sorted according to some criteria quickly, a search engine will typically collect metadata about the group of items under consideration beforehand through a process referred to as indexing. The index typically requires a smaller amount of computer storage, which is why some search engines only store the indexed information and not the full content of each item, and instead provide a method of navigating to the items in the search engine result page. Alternatively, the search engine may store a copy of each item in a cache so that users can see the state of the item at the time it was indexed or for archive purposes or to make repetitive processes work more efficiently and quickly.

Other types of search engines do not store an index. Crawler, or spider type search engines (a.k.a. real-time search engines) may collect and assess items at the time of the search query, dynamically considering additional items based on the contents of a starting item (known as a seed, or seed URL in the case of an Internet crawler). Meta search engines store neither an index nor a cache and instead simply reuse the index or results of one or more other search engine to provide an aggregated, final set of results.

Database size, which had been a significant marketing feature through the early 2000s, was similarly displaced by emphasis on relevancy ranking, the methods by which search engines attempt to sort the best results first. Relevancy ranking first became a major issue , when it became apparent that it was impractical to review full lists of results. Consequently, algorithms for relevancy ranking have continuously improved. Google&#x27;s PageRank method for ordering the results has received the most press, but all major search engines continually refine their ranking methodologies with a view toward improving the ordering of results. As of 2006, search engine rankings are more important than ever, so much so that an industry has developed (&quot;search engine optimizers&quot;, or &quot;SEO&quot;) to help web-developers improve their search ranking, and an entire body of case law has developed around matters that affect search engine rankings, such as use of trademarks in metatags. The sale of search rankings by some search engines has also created controversy among librarians and consumer advocates.

Search engine experience for users continues to be enhanced. Google&#x27;s addition of the Google Knowledge Graph has had wider ramifications for the Internet, possibly even limiting certain websites traffic, for example Wikipedia. By pulling information and presenting it on Google&#x27;s page, some argue that it can negatively affect other sites. However, there have been no major concerns.

==Search engine categories==
===Web search engines===

Search engines that are expressly designed for searching web pages, documents, and images were developed to facilitate searching through a large, nebulous blob of unstructured resources. They are engineered to follow a multi-stage process: crawling the infinite stockpile of pages and documents to skim the figurative foam from their contents, indexing the foam/buzzwords in a sort of semi-structured form (database or something), and at last, resolving user entries/queries to return mostly relevant results and links to those skimmed documents or pages from the inventory.

====Crawl====
In the case of a wholly textual search, the first step in classifying web pages is to find an ‘index item’ that might relate expressly to the ‘search term.’ In the past, search engines began with a small list of URLs as a so-called seed list, fetched the content, and parsed the links on those pages for relevant information, which subsequently provided new links. The process was highly cyclical and continued until enough pages were found for the searcher&#x27;s use.
These days, a continuous crawl method is employed as opposed to an incidental discovery based on a seed list. The crawl method is an extension of aforementioned discovery method.

Most search engines use sophisticated scheduling algorithms to “decide” when to revisit a particular page, to appeal to its relevance. These algorithms range from constant visit-interval with higher priority for more frequently changing pages to adaptive visit-interval based on several criteria such as frequency of change, popularity, and overall quality of site. The speed of the web server running the page as well as resource constraints like amount of hardware or bandwidth also figure in.

====Link map====
Pages that are discovered by web crawls are often distributed and fed into another computer that creates a map of resources uncovered. The bunchy clustermass looks a little like a graph, on which the different pages are represented as small nodes that are connected by links between the pages. 
The excess of data is stored in multiple data structures that permit quick access to said data by certain algorithms that compute the popularity score of pages on the web based on how many links point to a certain web page, which is how people can access any number of resources concerned with diagnosing psychosis. Another example would be the accessibility/rank of web pages containing information on Mohamed Morsi versus the very best attractions to visit in Cairo after simply entering ‘Egypt’ as a search term. One such algorithm, PageRank, proposed by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is well known and has attracted a lot of attention because it highlights repeat mundanity of web searches courtesy of students that don&#x27;t know how to properly research subjects on Google. 

The idea of doing link analysis to compute a popularity rank is older than PageRank. However, In October 2014, Google’s John Mueller confirmed that Google is not going to be updating it (Page Rank) going forward. Other variants of the same idea are currently in use – grade schoolers do the same sort of computations in picking kickball teams. These ideas can be categorized into three main categories: rank of individual pages and nature of web site content. Search engines often differentiate between internal links and external links, because web content creators are not strangers to shameless self-promotion. Link map data structures typically store the anchor text embedded in the links as well, because anchor text can often provide a “very good quality” summary of a web page&#x27;s content.

===Database Search Engines===
Searching for text-based content in databases presents a few special challenges from which a number of specialized search engines flourish. Databases can be slow when solving complex queries (with multiple logical or string matching arguments). Databases allow pseudo-logical queries which full-text searches do not use. There is no crawling necessary for a database since the data is already structured. However, it is often necessary to index the data in a more economized form to allow a more expeditious search.

===Mixed Search Engines===
Sometimes, data searched contains both database content and web pages or documents. Search engine technology has developed to respond to both sets of requirements. Most mixed search engines are large Web search engines, like Google. They search both through structured and unstructured data sources. Take for example, the word ‘ball.’ In its simplest terms, it returns more than 40 variations on Wikipedia alone. Did you mean a ball, as in the social gathering/dance? A soccer ball? The ball of the foot? Pages and documents are crawled and indexed in a separate index. Databases are indexed also from various sources. Search results are then generated for users by querying these multiple indices in parallel and compounding the results according to “rules.”

==History of search technology==
===The Memex===

The concept of hypertext and a memory extension originates from an article that was published in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in July 1945 written by Vannevar Bush, titled &quot;As We May Think&quot;. Within this article Vannevar urged scientists to work together to help build a body of knowledge for all mankind. He then proposed the idea of a virtually limitless, fast, reliable, extensible, associative memory storage and retrieval system. He named this device a memex.

Bush regarded the notion of “associative indexing” as his key conceptual contribution. As he explained, this was “a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another. This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing.

All of the documents used in the memex would be in the form of microfilm copy acquired as such or, in the case of personal records, transformed to microfilm by the machine itself. Memex would also employ new retrieval techniques based on a new kind of associative indexing the basic idea of which is a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another to create personal &quot;trails&quot; through linked documents. The new procedures, that Bush anticipated facilitating information storage and retrieval would lead to the development of wholly new forms of the encyclopedia.

The most important mechanism, conceived by Bush, is the associative trail. It would be a way to create a new linear sequence of microfilm frames across any arbitrary sequence of microfilm frames by creating a chained sequence of links in the way just described, along with personal comments and side trails.

In 1965, Bush took part in the project INTREX of MIT, for developing technology for mechanization the processing of information for library use. In his 1967 essay titled &quot;Memex Revisited&quot;, he pointed out that the development of the digital computer, the transistor, the video, and other similar devices had heightened the feasibility of such mechanization, but costs would delay its achievements.

===SMART===
Gerard Salton, who died on August 28 of 1995, was the father of modern search technology. His teams at Harvard and Cornell developed the SMART informational retrieval system. Salton&#x27;s Magic Automatic Retriever of Text included important concepts like the vector space model, Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), Term Frequency (TF), term discrimination values, and relevancy feedback mechanisms.

He authored a 56-page book called &quot;A Theory of Indexing&quot; which explained many of his tests, upon which search is still largely based.

===String Search Engines===
In 1987, an article was published detailing the development of a character string search engine (SSE) for rapid text retrieval on a double-metal 1.6-μm n-well CMOS solid-state circuit with 217,600 transistors lain out on a 8.62x12.76-mm die area. The SSE accommodated a novel string-search architecture which combines a 512-stage finite-state automaton (FSA) logic with a content addressable memory (CAM) to achieve an approximate string comparison of 80 million strings per second. The CAM cell consisted of four conventional static RAM (SRAM) cells and a read/write circuit. Concurrent comparison of 64 stored strings with variable length was achieved in 50 ns for an input text stream of 10 million characters/s, permitting performance despite the presence of single character errors in the form of character codes. Furthermore, the chip allowed nonanchor string search and variable-length `don&#x27;t care&#x27; (VLDC) string search.

<text>Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique that is usually performed with flashcards. Newly introduced and more difficult flashcards are shown more frequently, while older and less difficult flashcards are shown less frequently in order to exploit the psychological spacing effect. The use of spaced repetition has been proven to increase the rate of learning.

Although the principle is useful in many contexts, spaced repetition is commonly applied in contexts in which a learner must acquire many items and retain them indefinitely in memory. It is, therefore, well suited for the problem of vocabulary acquisition in the course of second-language learning. A number of spaced repetition software programs have been developed to aid the learning process. It is also possible to perform spaced repetition with physical flashcards using the Leitner system. The testing effect and spaced repetition can be combined to improve long-term memory. Therefore, memorization can be easier to do.

== History ==
The method of spaced repetition was first conceived of in the 1880s by German scientist Hermann Ebbinghaus. Ebbinghaus created the &#x27;forgetting curve&#x27; - a graph portraying the loss of learned information over time - and postulated that it can be curbed by reviewing such information at several intervals over a period of time.

It was also tested by Thomas Landauer and Robert A. Bjork in 1978; they gathered a group of psychology students, showing the students pictures of a certain individual followed by that individual&#x27;s name. This is also known as a face-name association. With the repetition of seeing the person&#x27;s name and face they were able to associate the name and face of that individual shown with the expansion of time due to the spaced repetition.

Schacter, Rich, and Stampp in 1985 expanded the research to include people who have amnesia and other memory disorders. The findings showed that using spaced repetition can not only help students with name face association but patients dealing with memory impairments.

In 1989, C. J. Camp decided that using this technique with Alzheimer&#x27;s patients may increase their duration of remembering particular things. These results show that the expansion of the time interval shows the strongest benefits for memory.

Spaced repetition is a method where the subject is asked to remember a certain fact with the time intervals increasing each time the fact is presented or said. If the subject is able to recall the information correctly the time is doubled to further help them keep the information fresh in their mind to recall in the future. With this method, the patient is able to place the information in their long-term memory. If they are unable to remember the information they go back to the previous step and continue to practice to help make the technique lasting (Vance &amp; Farr, 2007).

The expansion is done to ensure a high success level of recalling the information on the first time and increasing the time interval to make the information long-lasting to help keep the information always accessible in their mind.
Throughout the development of spaced repetition, they have found that patients using this technique with dementia are able to recall the information weeks—even months—later. The technique has been successful in helping dementia patients remember particular objects&#x27; names, daily tasks, name face association, information about themselves, and many other facts and behaviors (Small, 2012). Sufficient test evidence shows that spaced repetition is valuable in learning new information and recalling information from the past.

Small combines the works and findings of quite a few scientists to come up with five reasons why spaced repetition works: it helps show the relationship of routine memories, it shows the benefits of learning things with an expansion of time, it helps the patient with Alzheimer&#x27;s dementia keep their brain active, it has a high success level with little to no errors, and the technique is meaningful for the patient to do and remember more thing) Joltin et al. (2003), had a caregiver train a woman with Alzheimer&#x27;s by giving her the name of her grandchild over the phone while asking her to associate with the picture of the grandchild posted on the refrigerator. After training, the woman was able to recall the name of her grandchild five days later.

==Research and application==
The notion that spaced repetition could be used for improving learning was first proposed in the book &quot;Psychology of Study&quot; by C. A. Mace in 1932: &quot;Perhaps the most important discoveries are those which relate to the appropriate distribution of the periods of study... Acts of revision should be spaced in gradually increasing intervals, roughly intervals of one day, two days, four days, eight days, and so on.&quot;

In 1939, H. F. Spitzer tested the effects of a type of spaced repetition on sixth-grade students in Iowa who were learning science facts. Spitzer tested over 3600 students in Iowa and showed that spaced repetition was effective. This early work went unnoticed, and the field was relatively quiet until the late 1960s when cognitive psychologists, including Melton and Landauer and Bjork, explored manipulation of repetition timing as a means to improve recall. Around the same time, Pimsleur language courses pioneered the practical application of spaced repetition theory to language learning, and in 1973 Sebastian Leitner devised his &quot;Leitner system&quot;, an all-purpose spaced repetition learning system based on flashcards.

With the increase in access to personal computers in the 1980s, spaced repetition began to be implemented with computer-assisted language learning software-based solutions (see ), enabling automated scheduling and statistic gathering, scaling to thousands of cards scheduled individually. To enable the user to reach a target level of achievement (e.g. 90% of all material correctly recalled at any given time point), the software adjusts the repetition spacing interval. Material that is hard appears more often and material that is easy less often, with difficulty defined according to the ease with which the user is able to produce a correct response.

The data behind this initial research indicated that an increasing space between rehearsals (expanding) would yield a greater percentage of accuracy at test points. Spaced repetition with expanding intervals is believed to be so effective because with each expanded interval of repetition it becomes more difficult to retrieve the information because of the time elapsed between test periods; this creates a deeper level of processing of the learned information in long-term memory at each point. Another reason that the expanding repetition model is believed to work so effectively is that the first test happens early on in the rehearsal process. The purpose of this is to increase repetition success. By having a first test that followed initial learning with a successful repetition, people are more likely to remember this successful repetition on the following tests. Although expanding retrieval is commonly associated with spaced repetition, a uniform retrieval schedule is also a form of spaced repetition procedure.

A study conducted by Bui et al. (2013) examined how the advantages of spaced repetition can be influenced by the difference in working memory and the complexity of tasks that occurs between the repetitions. The researchers found participants with a higher working memory benefited from spaced repetition and showed better performance on challenging tasks.

Spaced repetition is typically studied through the use of memorizing facts. Traditionally speaking, it has not been applied to fields that required some manipulation or thought beyond simple factual/semantic information. A more recent study has shown that spaced repetition can benefit tasks such as solving math problems. In a study conducted by Pashler, Rohrer, Cepeda, and Carpenter, participants had to learn a simple math principle in either a spaced or massed retrieval schedule. The participants given the spaced repetition learning tasks showed higher scores on a final test distributed after their final practice session.

This is unique in the sense that it shows spaced repetition can be used to not only remember simple facts or contextual data but it can also be used in fields, such as math, where manipulation and the use of particular principles or formulas (e.g. y = mx + b) is necessary. These researchers also found that it is beneficial for feedback to be applied when administering the tests. When a participant gave a wrong response, they were likely to get it correct on the following tests if the researcher gave them the correct answer after a delayed period. 

Building on this, more recent studies have applied spaced repetition to procedural skill acquisition in complex domains. For example, a pilot study in neurosurgery training found that incorporating spaced repetition into a six-week simulation module improved residents’ proficiency in performing complex surgical procedures. Participants who engaged in structured, repeated practice showed significant improvements in objective performance metrics compared to those who trained using traditional methods alone. This suggests that spaced repetition can effectively facilitate the acquisition of procedural knowledge in surgical contexts, including its demonstrated applications in other areas of medical training.

Spaced repetition is a useful tool for learning that is relevant to many domains such as fact learning, mathematics, and procedural skills, and many different tasks (expanding or uniform retrieval). Many studies over the years have contributed to the use and implementation of spaced repetition, and it still remains a subject of interest for many researchers.

Over the years, techniques and tests have been formed to better patients with memory difficulties. Spaced repetition is one of these solutions to help better the patients&#x27; minds. Spaced repetition is used in many different areas of memory from remembering facts to remembering how to ride a bike to remembering past events from childhood. Recovery practice is used to see if an individual is able to recall something immediately after they have seen or studied it. Increasing recovery practice is frequently used as a technique in improving long-term memory, essentially for young children trying to learn and older individuals with memory diseases.

==Algorithms==
There are several families of spaced repetition algorithms:

* Leitner system: 5 levels and an arbitrary number of stages
* Neural network based
* SM family of algorithms (SuperMemo#Algorithms): SM-0 (a paper implementation) to SM-18 (in SuperMemo 18)
* DASH (&quot;Difficulty, Ability and Study History&quot;) family
* SSP-MMC (&quot;Stochastic Shortest Path Minimize Memorization Cost&quot;) and the closely related FSRS (&quot;Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler&quot;), the latter is available in Anki from release 23.10 and in RemNote from release 1.16

Some have theorized that the precise length of intervals does not have a great impact on algorithm effectiveness, although it has been suggested by others that the interval (expanded interval vs. fixed interval, etc.) is quite important. The experimental results regarding this point are mixed.

== Implementations ==
===Software===
Most spaced repetition software (SRS) is modeled after the manual style of learning with physical flashcards: items to memorize are entered into the program as question-answer pairs. When a pair is due to be reviewed, the question is displayed on a screen, and the user must attempt to answer. After answering, the user manually reveals the answer and then tells the program (subjectively) how difficult answering was. The program schedules pairs based on spaced repetition algorithms. Without a computer program, the user has to schedule physical flashcards; this is time-intensive and limits users to simple algorithms like the Leitner system.

To optimize review schedules, developments in spaced repetition algorithms focus on predictive modeling. These algorithms use randomly determined equations to determine the most effective timing for review sessions.

Further refinements with regard to software:
* &quot;&quot;: A user rates their confidence in each digital flashcard, e.g. on a scale of 1–5; a lower-confidence card is repeated more frequently until the user upgrades their confidence rating in it.
* Questions and/or answers can be a sound file to train recognition of spoken words.
* Automatic generation of pairs (e.g. for vocabulary, it is useful to generate three question-pairs: &quot;written foreign word&quot;, its &quot;pronunciation&quot; and its &quot;meaning&quot;, but data only has to be entered once.)
* Additional information retrieved automatically is available, such as example sentences containing a word.
* Opportunities to combine spaced repetition with online community functions, e.g. sharing courses.

=== Paper flash cards ===
The Leitner system is a widely used method of efficiently using flashcards that was proposed by the German science journalist Sebastian Leitner in the 1970s. It is a simple implementation of the principle of spaced repetition, where cards are reviewed at increasing intervals.

In this method, flashcards are sorted into groups according to how well the learner knows each one in Leitner&#x27;s learning box. The learners try to recall the solution written on a flashcard. If they succeed, they send the card to the next group. If they fail, they send it back to the first group. Each succeeding group has a longer period of time before the learner is required to revisit the cards. In Leitner&#x27;s original method, published in his book &quot;&quot; (&quot;How To Learn To Learn&quot;), the schedule of repetition was governed by the size of the partitions in the learning box. These were 1, 2, 5, 8 and 14 cm. Only when a partition became full was the learner to review some of the cards it contained, moving them forward or back, depending on whether they remembered them.

=== Audio instruction ===
Graduated-interval recall is a type of spaced repetition published by Paul Pimsleur in 1967. It is used in the Pimsleur language learning system and is particularly suited to programmed audio instruction due to the very short times (measured in seconds or minutes) between the first few repetitions, as compared to other forms of spaced repetition which may not require such precise timings. The intervals published in Pimsleur&#x27;s paper were: 5 seconds, 25 seconds, 2 minutes, 10 minutes, 1 hour, 5 hours, 1 day, 5 days, 25 days, 4 months, and 2 years.

==Criticism==

Spaced repetition with expanding intervals has long been argued to be the most beneficial version of this learning procedure, but research, which compared repetition procedures, has shown the difference between expanding repetition and uniform retrieval is either very little to nonexistent. A paper authored by John L Dobson has found cases where uniform retrieval is better than expanding. The main speculation for this range of results is that prior research has not accounted for the possibility of their results being affected by either the spacing condition or the number of successful repetitions during study periods.

There are two forms of implementing spacing in spaced repetition. The first form is absolute spacing. Absolute spacing is the measurement of all the trials within the learning and testing periods. An example of this would be that participants would study for a total of thirty trial periods, but the spacing of these trials can either be expanding or uniform. The second form is called relative spacing. Relative spacing measures the spacing of trials between each test. An example of this would be if the absolute spacing was thirty, participants would either have expanding intervals (1–5–10–14) or uniform intervals (5–5–5–5–5–5). This is important in measuring whether or not one type of repetition schedule is more beneficial than the other.

A common criticism of repetition research has argued that many of the tests involved have simply measured retention on a short-term scale. A study conducted by Karpicke and Bauernschmidt used this principle to determine the major differences between the different types of repetition. The two focused on studying long-term retention by testing participants over the course of one week. The participants were either assigned to a uniform schedule or an expanding schedule. No matter what type of spacing was assigned to the ninety-six participants, each completed three repeated tests at the end of their rehearsal intervals. Once those tests were completed, participants came back one week later to complete a final retention test. The researchers concluded that it did not matter what kind of repetition schedule was used. The biggest contribution to effective long-term learning was the spacing between the repeated tests (absolute spacing).

<doc id="27806" wikidata="Q3099491" url="?curid=27806" title="SuperMemo">
<text>SuperMemo (from &quot;Super Memory&quot;) is a learning method and software package developed by SuperMemo World and SuperMemo R&amp;D with Piotr Woźniak in Poland from 1985 to the present. It is based on research into long-term memory, and is a practical application of the spaced repetition learning method that has been proposed for efficient instruction by a number of psychologists as early as in the 1930s.

The method is available as a computer program for Windows, Windows CE, Windows Mobile, (Pocket PC), Palm OS (PalmPilot), etc. Course software by the same company (&quot;SuperMemo World&quot;) can also be used in a web browser or even without a computer.

The desktop version of SuperMemo started as a flashcard software (SuperMemo 1.0 (1987)). Since SuperMemo 10 (2000), it began to support incremental reading.

==Software implementation==

The SuperMemo program stores a database of questions and answers constructed by the user. When reviewing information saved in the database, the program uses the SuperMemo algorithm to decide what questions to show the user. The user then answers the question and rates their relative ease of recall - with grades of 0 to 5 (0 is the hardest, 5 is the easiest) - and their rating is used to calculate how soon they should be shown the question again. While the exact algorithm varies with the version of SuperMemo, in general, items that are harder to remember show up more frequently.

Besides simple text questions and answers, the latest version of SuperMemo supports images, video, and HTML questions and answers.

Since 2000, SuperMemo has had a unique set of features that distinguish it from other spaced repetition programs, called incremental reading (IR or &quot;&quot;). Whereas earlier versions were built around users entering information they wanted to use, using IR, users can import text that they want to learn from. The user reads the text inside of SuperMemo, and tools are provided to bookmark one&#x27;s location in the text and automatically schedule it to be revisited later, extract valuable information, and turn extracts into questions for the user to learn. By automating the entire process of reading and extracting knowledge to be remembered all in the same program, time is saved from having to manually prepare information, and insights into the nature of learning can be used to make the entire process more natural for the user. Furthermore, since the process of extracting knowledge can often lead to the extraction of more information than can actually be feasibly remembered, a priority system is implemented that allows the user to ensure that the most important information is remembered when they can&#x27;t review all information in the system.

== Algorithms ==
The specific algorithms SuperMemo uses have been published, and re-implemented in other programs.

Different algorithms have been used; SM-0 refers to the original (non-computer-based) algorithm, while SM-2 refers to the original computer-based algorithm released in 1987 (used in SuperMemo versions 1.0 through 3.0, referred to as SM-2 because SuperMemo version 2 was the most popular of these). Subsequent versions of the software have claimed to further optimize the algorithm.

Piotr Woźniak, the developer of SuperMemo algorithms, released the description for SM-5 in a paper titled &quot;Optimization of repetition spacing in the practice of learning.&quot; Little detail is specified in the algorithms released later than that.

In 1995, SM-8, which capitalized on data collected by users of SuperMemo 6 and SuperMemo 7 and added a number of improvements that strengthened the theoretical validity of the function of optimum intervals and made it possible to accelerate its adaptation, was introduced in SuperMemo 8.

In 2002, SM-11, the first SuperMemo algorithm that was resistant to interference from the delay or advancement of repetitions was introduced in SuperMemo 11 (aka SuperMemo 2002). In 2005, SM-11 was tweaked to introduce boundaries on A and B parameters computed from the Grade vs. Forgetting Index data.

In 2011, SM-15, which notably eliminated two weaknesses of SM-11 that would show up in heavily overloaded collections with very large item delays, was introduced in Supermemo 15.

In 2016, SM-17, the first version of the algorithm to incorporate the two component model of memory, was introduced in SuperMemo 17.

The latest version of the SuperMemo algorithm is SM-18, released in 2019.

=== Description of SM-2 algorithm ===

The first computer-based SuperMemo algorithm (SM-2) tracks three properties for each card being studied:

* The repetition number n, which is the number of times the card has been successfully recalled (meaning it was given a grade ≥ 3) in a row since the last time it was not.
* The easiness factor EF, which loosely indicates how &quot;easy&quot; the card is (more precisely, it determines how quickly the inter-repetition interval grows). The initial value of EF is 2.5.
* The inter-repetition interval I, which is the length of time (in days) SuperMemo will wait after the previous review before asking the user to review the card again.

Every time the user starts a review session, SuperMemo provides the user with the cards whose last review occurred at least I days ago. For each review, the user tries to recall the information and (after being shown the correct answer) specifies a grade q (from 0 to 5) indicating a self-evaluation the quality of their response, with each grade having the following meaning:

* 0: &quot;Total blackout&quot;, complete failure to recall the information.
* 1: Incorrect response, but upon seeing the correct answer it felt familiar.
* 2: Incorrect response, but upon seeing the correct answer it seemed easy to remember.
* 3: Correct response, but required significant effort to recall.
* 4: Correct response, after some hesitation.

After all scheduled reviews are complete, SuperMemo asks the user to re-review any cards they marked with a grade less than 4 repeatedly until they give a grade ≥ 4.

=== Non-SuperMemo implementations ===
Some of the algorithms have been re-implemented in other, often free programs such as Anki, Mnemosyne, and Emacs Org-mode&#x27;s Org-drill. See full list of flashcard software.

The SM-2 algorithm has proven most popular in other applications, and is used (in modified form) in Anki and Mnemosyne, among others. Org-drill implements SM-5 by default, and optionally other algorithms such as SM-2 and a simplified SM-8.

<text>Samuel Pepys ( ; 23 February 1633 – 26 May 1703) was an English writer and Tory politician. He served as an official in the Navy Board and Member of Parliament, but is most remembered today for the diary he kept for almost a decade. Though he had no maritime experience, Pepys rose to be the Chief Secretary to the Admiralty under both Charles II and James II through patronage, diligence, and his talent for administration. His influence and reforms at the English Admiralty were important in the early professionalisation of the Royal Navy.

The detailed private diary that Pepys kept from 1660 until 1669 was first published in the 19th century and is one of the most important primary sources of the Stuart Restoration. It provides a combination of personal revelation and eyewitness accounts of great events, such as the Great Plague of London, the Second Anglo-Dutch War and the Great Fire of London.

==Early life==
Pepys was born in Salisbury Court, Fleet Street, London, on 23 February 1633, the son of John Pepys (1601–1680), a tailor, and Margaret Pepys (&quot;née&quot; Kite; died 1667), daughter of a Whitechapel butcher. His great uncle Talbot Pepys was Recorder and briefly Member of Parliament (MP) for Cambridge in 1625. His father&#x27;s first cousin Sir Richard Pepys was elected MP for Sudbury in 1640, appointed Baron of the Exchequer on 30 May 1654, and appointed Lord Chief Justice of Ireland on 25 September 1655.

Pepys was the fifth of 11 children, but child mortality was high and he was soon the oldest survivor. He was baptised at St Bride&#x27;s Church on 3 March 1633. Pepys did not spend all of his infancy in London; for a while, he was sent to live with nurse Goody Lawrence at Kingsland, just north of the city. In about 1644, Pepys attended Huntingdon Grammar School before being educated at St Paul&#x27;s School, London, –1650. He attended the execution of Charles I in 1649.
In 1650, he went to the University of Cambridge, having received two exhibitions from St Paul&#x27;s School (perhaps owing to the influence of George Downing, who was chairman of the judges and for whom he later worked at the Exchequer) and a grant from the Mercers&#x27; Company. In October, he was admitted as a sizar to Magdalene College; he moved there in March 1651 and took his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1654.

Later in 1654 or early in 1655, he entered the household of one of his father&#x27;s cousins, Sir Edward Montagu, who was later created the 1st Earl of Sandwich.

When he was 22, Pepys married 14-year-old Elisabeth de St Michel, a descendant of French Huguenot immigrants, first in a religious ceremony on 10 October 1655 and later in a civil ceremony on 1 December 1655 at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster.

===Illness===

From a young age, Pepys suffered from bladder stones in his urinary tract — a condition from which his mother and brother John also later suffered. He was almost never without pain, as well as other symptoms, including &quot;blood in the urine&quot; (haematuria). By the time of his marriage, the condition was very severe.

In 1657, Pepys decided to undergo surgery; not an easy option, as the operation was known to be especially painful and hazardous. Nevertheless, Pepys consulted surgeon Thomas Hollier and, on 26 March 1658, the operation took place in a bedroom in the house of Pepys&#x27; cousin Jane Turner. Pepys&#x27; stone was successfully removed and he resolved to hold a celebration on every anniversary of the operation, which he did for several years. However, there were long-term effects from the operation. The incision on his bladder broke open again late in his life. The procedure may have left him sterile, though there is no direct evidence for this, as he was childless before the operation. In mid-1658 Pepys moved to Axe Yard, near the modern Downing Street. He worked as a teller in the Exchequer under George Downing.

== Diary ==


On 1 January 1660 (&quot;1 January 1659/1660&quot; in contemporary terms), Pepys began to keep a diary. He recorded his daily life for almost 10 years. This record of a decade of Pepys&#x27; life is more than a million words long and is often regarded as Britain&#x27;s most celebrated diary. Pepys has been called the greatest diarist of all time due to his frankness in writing concerning his own weaknesses and the accuracy with which he records events of daily British life and major events in the 17th century. Pepys wrote about the contemporary court and theatre (including his amorous affairs with the actresses), his household, and major political and social occurrences. Historians have used his diary to gain greater insight and understanding of life in London in the 17th century. Pepys wrote consistently on subjects such as personal finances, the time he got up in the morning, the weather, and what he ate. He wrote at length about his new watch which he was very proud of (and which had an alarm, a new accessory at the time), a country visitor who did not enjoy his time in London because he felt that it was too crowded, and his cat waking him up at one in the morning. Pepys&#x27; diary is one of a very few sources which provides such length in details of everyday life of an upper-middle-class man during the 17th century. The descriptions of the lives of his servants like Jane Birch provide a valuable detailed insight into their lives.

Aside from day-to-day activities, Pepys also commented on the significant and turbulent events of his nation. England was in disarray when he began writing his diary. Oliver Cromwell had died just a few years before, creating a period of civil unrest and a large power vacuum to be filled. Pepys had been a strong supporter of Cromwell, but he converted to the Royalist cause upon the Protector&#x27;s death. He was on the ship that returned Charles II to England to take up his throne and gave first-hand accounts of other significant events from the early years of the Restoration, such as the coronation of Charles II, the Great Plague, the Great Fire of London, and the Anglo–Dutch Wars.

Pepys did not plan on his contemporaries ever seeing his diary, which is evident from the fact that he wrote in shorthand and sometimes in a &quot;code&quot; of various Spanish, French, and Italian words (especially when describing his illicit affairs). However, Pepys often juxtaposed profanities in his native English amidst his &quot;code&quot; of foreign words, a practice which would reveal the details to any casual reader. He did intend for future generations to see the diary, as evidenced by its inclusion in his library and its catalogue before his death along with the shorthand guide he used and the elaborate planning by which he ensured his library survived intact after his death.

The women he pursued, his friends, and his dealings are all laid out. His diary reveals his jealousies, insecurities, trivial concerns, and his fractious relationship with his wife. It has been an important account of London in the 1660s. The juxtaposition of his commentary on politics and national events, alongside the very personal, can be seen from the beginning. His opening paragraphs, written in January 1660, begin:

The entries from the first few months were filled with news of General George Monck&#x27;s march on London. In April and May of that year, he encountered problems with his wife, and he accompanied Montagu&#x27;s fleet to the Netherlands to bring Charles II back from exile. Montagu was made Earl of Sandwich on 18 June, and Pepys secured the position of Clerk of the Acts to the Navy Board on 13 July. As secretary to the board, Pepys was entitled to a £350 annual salary plus the various gratuities and benefits that came with the job—including bribes. He rejected an offer of £1,000 for the position from a rival and soon afterward moved to official accommodation in Seething Lane in the City of London.

Pepys stopped writing his diary in 1669. His eyesight began to trouble him and he feared that writing in dim light was damaging his eyes. He did imply in his last entries that he might have others write his diary for him, but doing so would result in a loss of privacy and it seems that he never went through with those plans. In the end, Pepys lived another 34 years without going blind, but he never took to writing his diary again.

However, Pepys dictated a journal for two months in 1669–70 as a record of his dealings with the Commissioners of Accounts at that period. He also kept a diary for a few months in 1683 when he was sent to Tangier as the most senior civil servant in the Navy, during the English evacuation. The diary mostly covers work-related matters.

===Public life===
On the Navy Board, Pepys proved to be a more able and efficient worker than colleagues in higher positions. This often annoyed Pepys and provoked much harsh criticism in his diary. Among his colleagues were Admiral Sir William Penn, Sir George Carteret, Sir John Mennes, and Sir William Batten.

Pepys learned arithmetic from a private tutor and used models of ships to make up for his lack of first-hand nautical experience, and ultimately came to play a significant role in the board&#x27;s activities. In September 1660, he was made a Justice of the Peace; on 15 February 1662, Pepys was admitted as a Younger Brother of Trinity House; and on 30 April, he received the freedom of Portsmouth. Through Sandwich, he was involved in the administration of the short-lived English colony at Tangier. He joined the Tangier committee in August 1662 when the colony was first founded and became its treasurer in 1665. In 1663, he independently negotiated a £3,000 contract for Norwegian masts, demonstrating the freedom of action that his superior abilities allowed. He was appointed to a commission of the royal fishery on 8 April 1664.

Pepys&#x27; job required him to meet many people to dispense money and make contracts. He often laments how he &quot;lost his labour&quot; having gone to some appointment at a coffee house or tavern, only to discover that the person whom he was seeking was not there. These occasions were a constant source of frustration to Pepys.

===Major events===
Pepys&#x27; diary provides a first-hand account of the Restoration, and includes detailed accounts of several major events of the 1660s, along with the lesser known diary of John Evelyn. In particular, it is an invaluable source for the study of the Second Anglo-Dutch War of 1665–7, the Great Plague of 1665, and the Great Fire of London in 1666. In relation to the Plague and Fire, C. S. Knighton has written: &quot;From its reporting of these two disasters to the metropolis in which he thrived, Pepys&#x27;s diary has become a national monument.&quot; Robert Latham, editor of the definitive edition of the diary, remarks concerning the Plague and Fire: &quot;His descriptions of both—agonisingly vivid—achieve their effect by being something more than superlative reporting; they are written with compassion. As always with Pepys it is people, not literary effects, that matter.&quot;

====Second Anglo-Dutch War====

In early 1665, the start of the Second Anglo-Dutch War placed great pressure on Pepys. His colleagues were either engaged elsewhere or incompetent, and Pepys had to conduct a great deal of business himself. He excelled under the pressure, which was extreme due to the complexity and underfunding of the Royal Navy. At the outset, he proposed a centralised approach to supplying the fleet. His idea was accepted, and he was made surveyor-general of victualling in October 1665. The position brought a further £300 a year.

Pepys wrote about the Second Anglo-Dutch War: &quot;In all things, in wisdom, courage, force and success, the Dutch have the best of us and do end the war with victory on their side&quot;. And King Charles II said: &quot;Don&#x27;t fight the Dutch, imitate them&quot;.

In 1667, with the war lost, Pepys helped to discharge the navy. The Dutch had defeated England on open water and now began to threaten English soil itself. In June 1667, they conducted their Raid on the Medway, broke the defensive chain at Gillingham, and towed away the , one of the Royal Navy&#x27;s most important ships. As he had done during the Fire and the Plague, Pepys again removed his wife and his gold from London.

The Dutch raid was a major concern in itself, but Pepys was personally placed under a different kind of pressure: the Navy Board and his role as Clerk of the Acts came under scrutiny from the public and from Parliament. The war ended in August and, on 17 October, the House of Commons created a committee of &quot;miscarriages&quot;. On 20 October, a list was demanded from Pepys of ships and commanders at the time of the division of the fleet in 1666. However, these demands were actually quite desirable for him, as tactical and strategic mistakes were not the responsibility of the Navy Board.

The Board did face some allegations regarding the Medway raid, but they could exploit the criticism already attracted by Commissioner of Chatham Peter Pett to deflect criticism from themselves. The committee accepted this tactic when they reported in February 1668. The Board was, however, criticised for its use of tickets to pay seamen. These tickets could only be exchanged for cash at the Navy&#x27;s treasury in London. Pepys made a long speech at the bar of the Commons on 5 March 1668 defending this practice. It was, in the words of C. S. Knighton, a &quot;virtuoso performance&quot;.

The commission was followed by an investigation led by a more powerful authority, the commissioners of accounts. They met at Brooke House, Holborn and spent two years scrutinising how the war had been financed. In 1669, Pepys had to prepare detailed answers to the committee&#x27;s eight &quot;Observations&quot; on the Navy Board&#x27;s conduct. In 1670, he was forced to defend his own role. A seaman&#x27;s ticket with Pepys&#x27; name on it was produced as incontrovertible evidence of his corrupt dealings but, thanks to the intervention of the king, Pepys emerged from the sustained investigation relatively unscathed.

====Great Plague====

Outbreaks of plague were not unusual events in London; major epidemics had occurred in 1592, 1603, 1625 and 1636. Furthermore, Pepys was not among the group of people who were most at risk. He did not live in cramped housing, he did not routinely mix with the poor, and he was not required to keep his family in London in the event of a crisis. It was not until June 1665 that the unusual seriousness of the plague became apparent, so Pepys&#x27; activities in the first five months of 1665 were not significantly affected by it. Claire Tomalin wrote that 1665 was, to Pepys, one of the happiest years of his life. He worked very hard that year, and the outcome was that he quadrupled his fortune. In his annual summary on 31 December, he wrote, &quot;I have never lived so merrily (besides that I never got so much) as I have done this plague time&quot;.

Nonetheless, Pepys was certainly concerned about the plague. On 16 August he wrote:
He also chewed tobacco as a protection against infection, and worried that wig-makers might be using hair from the corpses as a raw material. Furthermore, it was Pepys who suggested that the Navy Office should evacuate to Greenwich, although he did offer to remain in town himself. He later took great pride in his stoicism. Meanwhile, Elisabeth Pepys was sent to Woolwich. She did not return to Seething Lane until January 1666 and was shocked by the sight of St Olave&#x27;s churchyard, where 300 people had been buried.

====Great Fire of London====


In the early hours of 2 September 1666, Pepys was awakened by Jane the maid, his servant, who had spotted a fire in the Billingsgate area. He decided that the fire was not particularly serious and returned to bed. Shortly after waking, his servant returned and reported that 300 houses had been destroyed and that London Bridge was threatened. Pepys went to the Tower of London to get a better view. Without returning home, he took a boat and observed the fire for over an hour. In his diary, Pepys recorded his observations as follows:

The wind was driving the fire westward, so he ordered the boat to go to Whitehall and became the first person to inform the king of the fire. According to his entry of 2 September 1666, Pepys recommended to the king that homes be pulled down in the path of the fire in order to stem its progress. Accepting this advice, the king told him to go to Lord Mayor Thomas Bloodworth and tell him to start pulling down houses. Pepys took a coach back as far as St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral before setting off on foot through the burning city. He found the Lord Mayor, who said, &quot;Lord! what can I do? I am spent: people will not obey me. I have been pulling down houses; but the fire overtakes us faster than we can do it.&quot; At noon, he returned home and &quot;had an extraordinary good dinner, and as merry, as at this time we could be&quot;, before returning to watch the fire in the city once more. Later, he returned to Whitehall, then met his wife in St James&#x27;s Park. In the evening, they watched the fire from the safety of Bankside. Pepys writes that &quot;it made me weep to see it&quot;. Returning home, Pepys met his clerk Tom Hayter who had lost everything. Hearing news that the fire was advancing, he started to pack up his possessions by moonlight.

A cart arrived at 4 a.m. on 3 September and Pepys spent much of the day arranging the removal of his possessions. Many of his valuables, including his diary, were sent to a friend from the Navy Office at Bethnal Green. At night, he &quot;fed upon the remains of yesterday&#x27;s dinner, having no fire nor dishes, nor any opportunity of dressing any thing.&quot; The next day, Pepys continued to arrange the removal of his possessions. By then, he believed that Seething Lane was in grave danger, so he suggested calling men from Deptford to help pull down houses and defend the king&#x27;s property. He described the chaos in the city and his curious attempt at saving his own goods:

Pepys had taken to sleeping on his office floor; on Wednesday, 5 September, he was awakened by his wife at 2 a.m. She told him that the fire had almost reached All Hallows-by-the-Tower and that it was at the foot of Seething Lane. He decided to send her and his gold — about £2,350 — to Woolwich. In the following days, Pepys witnessed looting, disorder, and disruption. On 7 September, he went to Paul&#x27;s Wharf and saw the ruins of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, of his old school, of his father&#x27;s house, and of the house in which he had had his bladder stone removed. Despite all this destruction, Pepys&#x27; house, office, and diary were saved.

===Personal life===

The diary gives a detailed account of Pepys&#x27; personal life. He was fond of wine, plays, and the company of other people. He also spent time evaluating his fortune and his place in the world. He was always curious and often acted on that curiosity, as he acted upon almost all his impulses. Periodically, he would resolve to devote more time to hard work instead of leisure. For example, in his entry for New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1661, he writes: &quot;I have newly taken a solemn oath about abstaining from plays and wine…&quot; The following months reveal his lapses to the reader; by 17 February, it is recorded, &quot;Here I drank wine upon necessity, being ill for the want of it.&quot;

Pepys was one of the most important civil servants of his age, and was also a widely cultivated man, taking an interest in books, music, the theatre, and science. Aside from English, he was fluent in French and read many texts in Latin. His favourite author was Virgil. He was passionately interested in music; he composed, sang, and played for pleasure, and even arranged music lessons for his servants. He played the lute, viol, violin, flageolet, recorder, and spinet to varying degrees of proficiency. He was also a keen singer, performing at home, in coffee houses, and even in Westminster Abbey. He and his wife took flageolet lessons from master Thomas Greeting. He also taught his wife to sing and paid for dancing lessons for her (although these stopped when he became jealous of the dancing master).

Pepys was an investor in the Company of Royal Adventurers Trading to Africa, which held the Royal monopoly on trading along the west coast of Africa in gold, silver, ivory, and slaves.

====Sexual relations====

Propriety did not prevent him from engaging in a number of extramarital liaisons with various women that were chronicled in his diary, often in some detail when relating the intimate details. The most dramatic of these encounters was with Deborah Willet, a young woman engaged as a companion for Elisabeth Pepys. On 25 October 1668, Pepys was surprised by his wife as he embraced Deb Willet; he writes that his wife &quot;coming up suddenly, did find me imbracing the girl con &quot;[with]&quot; my hand sub &quot;[under]&quot; su &quot;[her]&quot; coats; and endeed I was with my main &quot;[hand]&quot; in her cunny. I was at a wonderful loss upon it and the girl also...&quot; Following this event, he was characteristically filled with remorse, but (equally characteristically) continued to pursue Willet after she had been dismissed from the Pepys household. Pepys also had a habit of fondling the breasts of his maid Mary Mercer while she dressed him in the morning.

Pepys may also have dallied with a leading actress of the Restoration period, Mary Knep. &quot;Mrs Knep was the wife of a Smithfield horsedealer, and the mistress of Pepys&quot;—or at least &quot;she granted him a share of her favours&quot;. Scholars disagree on the full extent of the Pepys/Knep relationship, but much of later generations&#x27; knowledge of Knep comes from the diary. Pepys first met Knep on 6 December 1665. He described her as &quot;pretty enough, but the most excellent, mad-humoured thing, and sings the noblest that I ever heard in my life.&quot; He called her husband &quot;an ill, melancholy, jealous-looking fellow&quot; and suspected him of abusing his wife. Knep provided Pepys with backstage access and was a conduit for theatrical and social gossip. When they wrote notes to each other, Pepys signed himself &quot;Dapper Dickey&quot;, while Knep was &quot;Barbry Allen&quot; (a popular song that was an item in her musical repertory).
Pepys&#x27; reference to purchasing the pornographic book &quot;L&#x27;Escole des Filles&quot; appears to be the first English reference to pornography. He writes in his diary that it was a &quot;mighty lewd book,&quot; and burned it after reading it.

Much of Pepys&#x27; behavior towards women, which he cataloged himself in his diary, would today be considered sexual harassment, sexual assault, and rape. Despite his kindness and emotional loyalty towards some women in his life, Pepys ultimately believed men were entitled to the bodies of girls and women. Kate Loveman of Cambridge University describes this belief: &quot;[In his diary] Pepys&#x27;s sexual language of being ‘kind’, ‘touching’, and ‘tumbling’ emphasized his indulgence and playfulness, while masking coercion and violence; meanwhile, [his victim] Lane&#x27;s claims of assault he regarded as exemplifying a woman&#x27;s ‘falseness’, not because he thought there had been no violence, but because she had no moral right to protest.&quot;

===Text of the diary===
The diary was written in one of the many standard forms of shorthand used in Pepys&#x27; time, in this case called tachygraphy, and devised by Thomas Shelton. It is clear from its content that it was written as a purely personal record of his life and not for publication, yet there are indications that Pepys took steps to preserve the bound manuscripts of his diary. He wrote it out in fair copy from rough notes, and he also had the loose pages bound into six volumes, catalogued them in his library with all his other books, and is likely to have suspected that eventually someone would find them interesting.

==After the diary==

Pepys&#x27; health suffered from the long hours that he worked throughout the period of the diary. Specifically, he believed that his eyesight had been affected by his work. He reluctantly concluded in his last entry, dated 31 May 1669, that he should completely stop writing for the sake of his eyes, and only dictate to his clerks from then on, which meant that he could no longer keep his diary.

Pepys and his wife took a holiday to France and the Low Countries in June–October 1669; on their return, Elisabeth fell ill and died on 10 November 1669. Pepys erected a monument to her in the church of St Olave&#x27;s, Hart Street, London. Pepys never remarried, but he did have a long-term housekeeper named Mary Skinner who was assumed by many of his contemporaries to be his mistress and sometimes referred to as Mrs. Pepys. In his will, he left her an annuity of £200 and many of his possessions.

===Member of Parliament and Secretary of the Admiralty===

In 1672, he became an Elder Brother of Trinity House and served in this capacity until 1689; he was Master of Trinity House in 1676–1677 and again in 1685–1686. In 1673, he was promoted to Secretary of the Admiralty Commission and elected MP for Castle Rising in Norfolk.

In 1673, he was involved with the establishment of the Royal Mathematical School at Christ&#x27;s Hospital, which was to train 40 boys annually in navigation, for the benefit of the Royal Navy and the English Merchant Navy. In 1675, he was appointed a Governor of Christ&#x27;s Hospital and for many years he took a close interest in its affairs. Among his papers are two detailed memoranda on the administration of the school. In 1699, after the successful conclusion of a seven-year campaign to get the master of the Mathematical School replaced by a man who knew more about the sea, he was rewarded for his service as a Governor by being made a Freeman of the City of London. He also served as Master (without ever having been a Freeman or Liveryman) of the Clothworkers&#x27; Company (1677-8).

At the beginning of 1679, Pepys was elected MP for Harwich in Charles II&#x27;s third parliament which formed part of the Cavalier Parliament. He was elected along with Sir Anthony Deane, a Harwich alderman and leading naval architect, to whom Pepys had been a patron since 1662. By May of that year, they were under attack from their political enemies. Pepys resigned as Secretary of the Admiralty. They were imprisoned in the Tower of London on suspicion of treasonable correspondence with France, specifically leaking naval intelligence. The charges are believed to have been fabricated under the direction of Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury. Pepys was accused, among other things, of being a secret member of the Catholic Church in England. Pepys and Deane were released in July, but proceedings against them were not dropped until June 1680.
Though he had resigned from the Tangier committee in 1679, in 1683 he was sent to Tangier to assist Lord Dartmouth with the evacuation and abandonment of the English colony. After six months&#x27; service, he travelled back through Spain accompanied by the naval engineer Edmund Dummer, returning to England after a particularly rough passage on 30 March 1684. In June 1684, once more in favour, he was appointed King&#x27;s Secretary for the affairs of the Admiralty, a post that he retained after the death of Charles II (February 1685) and the accession of James II. The phantom Pepys Island, alleged to be near South Georgia, was named after him in 1684, having been first &quot;discovered&quot; during his tenure at the Admiralty.

From 1685 to 1688, he was active not only as Secretary of the Admiralty, but also as MP for Harwich. He had been elected MP for Sandwich, but this election was contested and he immediately withdrew to Harwich. When James fled the country at the end of 1688, Pepys&#x27;s career also came to an end. In January 1689, he was defeated in the parliamentary election at Harwich; in February, one week after the accession of William III and Mary II, he resigned his secretaryship.

===Royal Society===
He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1665 and served as its President from 1 December 1684 to 30 November 1686. Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; was published during this period, and its title page bears Pepys&#x27; name. There is a probability problem called the &quot;Newton–Pepys problem&quot; that arose out of correspondence between Newton and Pepys about whether one is more likely to roll at least one six with six dice or at least two sixes with twelve dice. It has only recently been noted that the gambling advice that Newton gave Pepys was correct, while the logical argument with which Newton accompanied it was unsound.

===Retirement and death===
He was imprisoned on suspicion of Jacobitism from May to July 1689 and again in June 1690, but no charges were ever successfully brought against him. After his release, he retired from public life at age 57. He moved out of London 10 years later (1701) to a house in Clapham owned by his friend William Hewer, who had begun his career working for Pepys in the admiralty. Clapham was in the country at the time; it is now part of inner London.

Pepys lived there until his death on 26 May 1703. He had no children and bequeathed his estate to his unmarried nephew John Jackson. Pepys had disinherited his nephew Samuel Jackson for marrying contrary to his wishes. When John Jackson died in 1724, Pepys&#x27; estate reverted to Anne, daughter of Archdeacon Samuel Edgeley, niece of Will Hewer and sister of Hewer Edgeley, nephew and godson of Pepys&#x27; old Admiralty employee and friend Will Hewer. Hewer was also childless and left his immense estate to his nephew Hewer Edgeley (consisting mostly of the Clapham property, as well as lands in Clapham, London, Westminster, and Norfolk) on condition that the nephew (and godson) would adopt the surname Hewer. So Will Hewer&#x27;s heir became Hewer Edgeley-Hewer, and he adopted the old Will Hewer home in Clapham as his residence. That is how the Edgeley family acquired the estates of both Samuel Pepys and Will Hewer, with sister Anne inheriting Pepys&#x27; estate, and brother Hewer inheriting that of Will Hewer. On the death of Hewer Edgeley-Hewer in 1728, the old Hewer estate went to Edgeley-Hewer&#x27;s widow Elizabeth, who left the estate to Levett Blackborne, the son of Abraham Blackborne, merchant of Clapham, and other family members, who later sold it off in lots. Lincoln&#x27;s Inn barrister Levett Blackborne also later acted as attorney in legal scuffles for the heirs who had inherited the Pepys estate.

Pepys&#x27; former protégé and friend Hewer acted as the executor of Pepys&#x27;s estate.

Pepys was buried along with his wife in St Olave&#x27;s Church, Hart Street in London.

==Pepys Library==

Pepys was a lifelong bibliophile and carefully nurtured his large collection of books, manuscripts, and prints. At his death, there were more than 3,000 volumes, including the diary, all carefully catalogued and indexed; they form one of the most important surviving 17th-century private libraries. The most important items in the Library are the six original bound manuscripts of Pepys&#x27; diary, but there are other remarkable holdings, including:
* Incunabula by William Caxton, Wynkyn de Worde, and Richard Pynson
* Sixty medieval manuscripts
* The &quot;Pepys Manuscript&quot;, a late-15th-century English choirbook
* Naval records such as two of the &#x27;Anthony Rolls&#x27;, illustrating the Royal Navy&#x27;s ships , including the &quot;Mary Rose&quot;
* Sir Francis Drake&#x27;s personal almanac
* Over 1,800 printed ballads, one of the finest collections in existence.

Pepys made detailed provisions in his will for the preservation of his book collection. His nephew and heir John Jackson died in 1723, when it was transferred intact to Magdalene College, Cambridge, where it can be seen in the Pepys Library. The bequest included all the original bookcases and his elaborate instructions that placement of the books &quot;be strictly reviewed and, where found requiring it, more nicely adjusted&quot;.

The Ephemera Society emblem uses Pepys&#x27; portrait and characterizes him as “the first general ephemerist.” Two large albums of ephemera saved by Pepys are in his library.

==Publication history of the diary==
Motivated by the publication of John Evelyn&#x27;s Diary in 1818, Lord Granville deciphered a few pages. John Smith (later the Rector of St Mary the Virgin in Baldock) was then engaged to transcribe the diaries into plain English. He laboured at this task for three years, from 1819 to 1822, unaware until nearly finished that a key to the shorthand system was stored in Pepys&#x27; library a few shelves above the diary volumes. Others had apparently succeeded in reading the diary earlier, perhaps knowing about the key, because a work of 1812 quotes from a passage of it. Smith&#x27;s transcription, which is also kept in the Pepys Library, was the basis for the first published edition of the diary, edited by Lord Braybrooke, released in two volumes in 1825.

A second transcription, done with the benefit of the key, but often less accurately, was completed in 1875 by Mynors Bright and published in 1875–1879. This added about a third to the previously published text, but still left only about 80% of the diary in print. Henry B. Wheatley, drawing on both his predecessors, produced a new edition in 1893–1899, revised in 1926, with extensive notes and an index.

All of these editions omitted passages (chiefly about Pepys&#x27; sexual adventures) that the editors thought were too obscene ever to be printed. Wheatley, in the preface to his edition, noted, &quot;a few passages which cannot possibly be printed. It may be thought by some that these omissions are due to an unnecessary squeamishness, but it is not really so, and readers are therefore asked to have faith in the judgement of the editor.&quot; Wheatley claims to have indicated all such omissions with an ellipsis, but comparison with the modern text indicates that he did not always do this, and that he silently bowdlerised a number of words.

The complete, unexpurgated, and definitive edition, edited and transcribed by Robert Latham and William Matthews, was published by Bell &amp; Hyman, London, and the University of California Press, Berkeley, in nine volumes, along with separate Companion and Index volumes, over the years 1970–1983. Various single-volume abridgements of this text are also available.

The Introduction in Volume I provides a scholarly but readable account of &quot;The Diarist&quot;, &quot;The Diary&quot; (&quot;The Manuscript&quot;, &quot;The Shorthand&quot;, and &quot;The Text&quot;), &quot;History of Previous Editions&quot;, &quot;The Diary as Literature&quot;, and &quot;The Diary as History&quot;. The Companion provides a long series of detailed essays about Pepys and his world.

The first unabridged recording of the diary as an audiobook was published in 2015 by &quot;Naxos AudioBooks&quot;.

On 1 January 2003 Phil Gyford started a weblog, pepysdiary.com, that serialised the diary one day each evening together with annotations from the public and experts alike. In December 2003 the blog won the best specialist blog award in &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s Best of British Blogs. In 2021, Gyford noted the existence of the Samuel Pepys Twitter account; set up in 2008, the account similarly serialises Pepys&#x27; diary each day.

==Adaptations==
In 1958, the BBC produced a serial called &quot;The Diary of Samuel Pepys&quot;, in which Peter Sallis played the title role. In 2003, a television film, &quot;The Private Life of Samuel Pepys&quot; aired on BBC2, in which Steve Coogan played Pepys. The 2004 film &quot;Stage Beauty&quot; concerns London theatre in the 17th century and is based on Jeffrey Hatcher&#x27;s play &quot;Compleat Female Stage Beauty&quot;, which in turn was inspired by a reference in Pepys&#x27; diary to the actor Edward Kynaston, who played female roles in the days when women were forbidden to appear on stage. Pepys is a character in the film and is portrayed as an ardent devotee of the theatre. Hugh Bonneville plays Pepys. Daniel Mays portrays Pepys in &quot;The Great Fire&quot;, a 2014 BBC television miniseries. Pepys has also been portrayed in various other film and television productions, played by diverse actors including Mervyn Johns, Michael Palin, Michael Graham Cox, and Philip Jackson.

BBC Radio 4 has broadcast serialised radio dramatisations of the diary. In the 1990s it was performed as a &quot;Classic Serial&quot; starring Bill Nighy, and in the 2010s it was serialised as part of the &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot; radio magazine programme. One audiobook edition of Pepys&#x27; diary selections is narrated by Kenneth Branagh. A fictionalised Pepys narrates the second chapter of Harry Turtledove&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;A Different Flesh&quot; (serialised 1985–1988, book form 1988). This chapter is entitled &quot;And So to Bed&quot; and written in the form of entries from the Pepys diary. The entries detail Pepys&#x27; encounter with American &quot;Homo erectus&quot; specimens (imported to London as beasts of burden) and his formation of the &quot;transformational theory of life&quot;, thus causing evolutionary theory to gain a foothold in scientific thought in the 17th century rather than the 19th. Deborah Swift&#x27;s 2017 novel &quot;Pleasing Mr Pepys&quot; is described as a &quot;re-imagining of the events in Samuel Pepys&#x27;s Diary&quot;. The 2022 book &quot;The Lost Diary of Samuel Pepys&quot; by Jack Jewers imagined a secret continuation of Pepys&#x27; diaries, in which he became an unwilling agent for the crown. The novel, which was named a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; historical fiction book of the year, is to be followed by a sequel, &quot;The King&#x27;s Man&quot;, in 2025.

==Biographical studies==

Several detailed studies of Pepys&#x27; life are available. Arthur Bryant published his three-volume study in 1933–1938, long before the definitive edition of the diary, but, thanks to Bryant&#x27;s lively style, it is still of interest. In 1974, Richard Ollard produced a new biography that drew on Latham&#x27;s and Matthew&#x27;s work on the text, benefiting from the author&#x27;s deep knowledge of Restoration politics. Other biographies include: &quot;Samuel Pepys: A Life&quot;, by Stephen Coote (London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 2000) and, &quot;Samuel Pepys and His World&quot;, by Geoffrey Trease (London: Thames and Hudson, 1972).

The most recent general study, &quot;Samuel Pepys: The Unequalled Self&quot;, is by Claire Tomalin. Tomalin&#x27;s book won the 2002 Whitbread Book of the Year award, the judges calling it a &quot;rich, thoughtful and deeply satisfying&quot; account that unearths &quot;a wealth of material about the uncharted life of Samuel Pepys&quot;.

<text>Chemical synapses are biological junctions through which neurons&#x27; signals can be sent to each other and to non-neuronal cells such as those in muscles or glands. Chemical synapses allow neurons to form circuits within the central nervous system. They are crucial to the biological computations that underlie perception and thought. They allow the nervous system to connect to and control other systems of the body.

At a chemical synapse, one neuron releases neurotransmitter molecules into a small space (the synaptic cleft) that is adjacent to another neuron. The neurotransmitters are contained within small sacs called synaptic vesicles, and are released into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis. These molecules then bind to neurotransmitter receptors on the postsynaptic cell. Finally, the neurotransmitters are cleared from the synapse through one of several potential mechanisms including enzymatic degradation or re-uptake by specific transporters either on the presynaptic cell or on some other neuroglia to terminate the action of the neurotransmitter.

The adult human brain is estimated to contain from 1014 to 5 × 1014 (100–500 trillion) synapses. Every cubic millimeter of cerebral cortex contains roughly a billion (short scale, i.e. 109) of them. The number of synapses in the human cerebral cortex has separately been estimated at 0.15 quadrillion (150 trillion)

The word &quot;synapse&quot; was introduced by Sir Charles Scott Sherrington in 1897. Chemical synapses are not the only type of biological synapse: electrical and immunological synapses also exist. Without a qualifier, however, &quot;synapse&quot; commonly refers to chemical synapses.

==Structure==
Synapses are functional connections between neurons, or between neurons and other types of cells. A typical neuron gives rise to several thousand synapses, although there are some types that make far fewer. Most synapses connect axons to dendrites, but there are also other types of connections, including axon-to-cell-body, axon-to-axon, and dendrite-to-dendrite. Synapses are generally too small to be recognizable using a light microscope except as points where the membranes of two cells appear to touch, but their cellular elements can be visualized clearly using an electron microscope.

Chemical synapses pass information directionally from a presynaptic cell to a postsynaptic cell and are therefore asymmetric in structure and function. The presynaptic axon terminal, or synaptic bouton, is a specialized area within the axon of the presynaptic cell that contains neurotransmitters enclosed in small membrane-bound spheres called synaptic vesicles (as well as a number of other supporting structures and organelles, such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum). Synaptic vesicles are docked at the presynaptic plasma membrane at regions called active zones.

Immediately opposite is a region of the postsynaptic cell containing neurotransmitter receptors; for synapses between two neurons the postsynaptic region may be found on the dendrites or cell body. Immediately behind the postsynaptic membrane is an elaborate complex of interlinked proteins called the postsynaptic density (PSD).

Proteins in the PSD are involved in anchoring and trafficking neurotransmitter receptors and modulating the activity of these receptors. The receptors and PSDs are often found in specialized protrusions from the main dendritic shaft called dendritic spines.

Synapses may be described as symmetric or asymmetric. When examined under an electron microscope, asymmetric synapses are characterized by rounded vesicles in the presynaptic cell, and a prominent postsynaptic density. Asymmetric synapses are typically excitatory. Symmetric synapses in contrast have flattened or elongated vesicles, and do not contain a prominent postsynaptic density. Symmetric synapses are typically inhibitory.

The synaptic cleft—also called synaptic gap—is a gap between the pre- and postsynaptic cells that is about 20 nm (0.02 μ) wide. The small volume of the cleft allows neurotransmitter concentration to be raised and lowered rapidly.

An autapse is a chemical (or electrical) synapse formed when the axon of one neuron synapses with its own dendrites.

== Signaling in chemical synapses ==

===Overview===
Here is a summary of the sequence of events that take place in synaptic transmission from a presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic cell. Each step is explained in more detail below. Note that with the exception of the final step, the entire process may run only a few hundred microseconds, in the fastest synapses.
# The process begins with a wave of electrochemical excitation called an action potential traveling along the membrane of the presynaptic cell, until it reaches the synapse.
# The electrical depolarization of the membrane at the synapse causes channels to open that are permeable to calcium ions.
# Calcium ions flow through the presynaptic membrane, rapidly increasing the calcium concentration in the interior.
# The high calcium concentration activates a set of calcium-sensitive proteins attached to vesicles that contain a neurotransmitter chemical.
# These proteins change shape, causing the membranes of some &quot;docked&quot; vesicles to fuse with the membrane of the presynaptic cell, thereby opening the vesicles and dumping their neurotransmitter contents into the synaptic cleft, the narrow space between the membranes of the pre- and postsynaptic cells.
# The neurotransmitter diffuses within the cleft. Some of it escapes, but some of it binds to chemical receptor molecules located on the membrane of the postsynaptic cell.
# The binding of neurotransmitter causes the receptor molecule to be &quot;activated&quot; in some way. Several types of activation are possible, as described in more detail below. In any case, this is the key step by which the synaptic process affects the behavior of the postsynaptic cell.
# Due to thermal vibration, the motion of atoms, vibrating about their equilibrium positions in a crystalline solid, neurotransmitter molecules eventually break loose from the receptors and drift away.
# The neurotransmitter is either reabsorbed by the presynaptic cell, and then repackaged for future release, or else it is broken down metabolically.

===Neurotransmitter release===

The release of a neurotransmitter is triggered by the arrival of a nerve impulse (or action potential) and occurs through an unusually rapid process of cellular secretion (exocytosis). Within the presynaptic nerve terminal, vesicles containing neurotransmitter are localized near the synaptic membrane. The arriving action potential produces an influx of calcium ions through voltage-dependent, calcium-selective ion channels at the down stroke of the action potential (tail current). Calcium ions then bind to synaptotagmin proteins found within the membranes of the synaptic vesicles, allowing the vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. The fusion of a vesicle is a stochastic process, leading to frequent failure of synaptic transmission at the very small synapses that are typical for the central nervous system. Large chemical synapses (e.g. the neuromuscular junction), on the other hand, have a synaptic release probability, in effect, of 1. Vesicle fusion is driven by the action of a set of proteins in the presynaptic terminal known as SNAREs. As a whole, the protein complex or structure that mediates the docking and fusion of presynaptic vesicles is called the active zone. The membrane added by the fusion process is later retrieved by endocytosis and recycled for the formation of fresh neurotransmitter-filled vesicles.

An exception to the general trend of neurotransmitter release by vesicular fusion is found in the type II receptor cells of mammalian taste buds. Here the neurotransmitter ATP is released directly from the cytoplasm into the synaptic cleft via voltage gated channels.

===Receptor binding===
Receptors on the opposite side of the synaptic gap bind neurotransmitter molecules. Receptors can respond in either of two general ways. First, the receptors may directly open ligand-gated ion channels in the postsynaptic cell membrane, causing ions to enter or exit the cell and changing the local transmembrane potential. The resulting change in voltage is called a postsynaptic potential. In general, the result is &quot;excitatory&quot; in the case of depolarizing currents, and &quot;inhibitory&quot; in the case of hyperpolarizing currents. Whether a synapse is excitatory or inhibitory depends on what type(s) of ion channel conduct the postsynaptic current(s), which in turn is a function of the type of receptors and neurotransmitter employed at the synapse. The second way a receptor can affect membrane potential is by modulating the production of chemical messengers inside the postsynaptic neuron. These second messengers can then amplify the inhibitory or excitatory response to neurotransmitters.

===Termination===
After a neurotransmitter molecule binds to a receptor molecule, it must be removed to allow for the postsynaptic membrane to continue to relay subsequent EPSPs and/or IPSPs. This removal can happen through one or more processes:
* The neurotransmitter may diffuse away due to thermally-induced oscillations of both it and the receptor, making it available to be broken down metabolically outside the neuron or to be reabsorbed.
* Enzymes within the subsynaptic membrane may inactivate/metabolize the neurotransmitter.
* Reuptake pumps may actively pump the neurotransmitter back into the presynaptic axon terminal for reprocessing and re-release following a later action potential.

==Synaptic strength==
The strength of a synapse has been defined by Bernard Katz as the product of (presynaptic) release probability &quot;pr&quot;, quantal size &quot;q&quot; (the postsynaptic response to the release of a single neurotransmitter vesicle, a &#x27;quantum&#x27;), and &quot;n&quot;, the number of release sites. &quot;Unitary connection&quot; usually refers to an unknown number of individual synapses connecting a presynaptic neuron to a postsynaptic neuron. 
The amplitude of postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) can be as low as 0.4 mV to as high as 20 mV. The amplitude of a PSP can be modulated by neuromodulators or can change as a result of previous activity. Changes in the synaptic strength can be short-term, lasting seconds to minutes, or long-term (long-term potentiation, or LTP), lasting hours. Learning and memory are believed to result from long-term changes in synaptic strength, via a mechanism known as synaptic plasticity.

==Receptor desensitization==

Desensitization of the postsynaptic receptors is a decrease in response to the same neurotransmitter stimulus. It means that the strength of a synapse may in effect diminish as a train of action potentials arrive in rapid succession – a phenomenon that gives rise to the so-called frequency dependence of synapses. The nervous system exploits this property for computational purposes, and can tune its synapses through such means as phosphorylation of the proteins involved.

== Synaptic plasticity ==

Synaptic transmission can be changed by previous activity. These changes are called synaptic plasticity and may result in either a decrease in the efficacy of the synapse, called depression, or an increase in efficacy, called potentiation. These changes can either be long-term or short-term. Forms of short-term plasticity include synaptic fatigue or depression and synaptic augmentation. Forms of long-term plasticity include long-term depression and long-term potentiation. Synaptic plasticity can be either homosynaptic (occurring at a single synapse) or heterosynaptic (occurring at multiple synapses).

===Homosynaptic plasticity=== 

Homosynaptic plasticity (or also homotropic modulation) is a change in the synaptic strength that results from the history of activity at a particular synapse. This can result from changes in presynaptic calcium as well as feedback onto presynaptic receptors, i.e. a form of autocrine signaling. Homosynaptic plasticity can affect the number and replenishment rate of vesicles or it can affect the relationship between calcium and vesicle release. Homosynaptic plasticity can also be postsynaptic in nature. It can result in either an increase or decrease in synaptic strength.

One example is neurons of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which release noradrenaline, which, besides affecting postsynaptic receptors, also affects presynaptic α2-adrenergic receptors, inhibiting further release of noradrenaline. This effect is utilized with clonidine to perform inhibitory effects on the SNS.

===Heterosynaptic plasticity=== 

Heterosynaptic plasticity (or also heterotropic modulation) is a change in synaptic strength that results from the activity of other neurons. Again, the plasticity can alter the number of vesicles or their replenishment rate or the relationship between calcium and vesicle release. Additionally, it could directly affect calcium influx. Heterosynaptic plasticity can also be postsynaptic in nature, affecting receptor sensitivity.

One example is again neurons of the sympathetic nervous system, which release noradrenaline, which, in addition, generates an inhibitory effect on presynaptic terminals of neurons of the parasympathetic nervous system.

== Integration of synaptic inputs ==

In general, if an excitatory synapse is strong enough, an action potential in the presynaptic neuron will trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic cell. In many cases the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) will not reach the threshold for eliciting an action potential. When action potentials from multiple presynaptic neurons fire simultaneously, or if a single presynaptic neuron fires at a high enough frequency, the EPSPs can overlap and summate. If enough EPSPs overlap, the summated EPSP can reach the threshold for initiating an action potential. This process is known as summation, and can serve as a high pass filter for neurons.

On the other hand, a presynaptic neuron releasing an inhibitory neurotransmitter, such as GABA, can cause an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) in the postsynaptic neuron, bringing the membrane potential farther away from the threshold, decreasing its excitability and making it more difficult for the neuron to initiate an action potential. If an IPSP overlaps with an EPSP, the IPSP can in many cases prevent the neuron from firing an action potential. In this way, the output of a neuron may depend on the input of many different neurons, each of which may have a different degree of influence, depending on the strength and type of synapse with that neuron. John Carew Eccles performed some of the important early experiments on synaptic integration, for which he received the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1963.

==Volume transmission==
When a neurotransmitter is released at a synapse, it reaches its highest concentration inside the narrow space of the synaptic cleft, but some of it is certain to diffuse away before being reabsorbed or broken down. If it diffuses away, it has the potential to activate receptors that are located either at other synapses or on the membrane away from any synapse. The extrasynaptic activity of a neurotransmitter is known as &quot;volume transmission&quot;. It is well established that such effects occur to some degree, but their functional importance has long been a matter of controversy.

Recent work indicates that volume transmission may be the predominant mode of interaction for some special types of neurons. In the mammalian cerebral cortex, a class of neurons called neurogliaform cells can inhibit other nearby cortical neurons by releasing the neurotransmitter GABA into the extracellular space. Along the same vein, GABA released from neurogliaform cells into the extracellular space also acts on surrounding astrocytes, assigning a role for volume transmission in the control of ionic and neurotransmitter homeostasis. Approximately 78% of neurogliaform cell boutons do not form classical synapses. This may be the first definitive example of neurons communicating chemically where classical synapses are not present.

==Relationship to electrical synapses==
An electrical synapse is an electrically conductive link between two abutting neurons that is formed at a narrow gap between the pre- and postsynaptic cells, known as a gap junction. At gap junctions, cells approach within about 3.5 nm of each other, rather than the 20 to 40 nm distance that separates cells at chemical synapses. As opposed to chemical synapses, the postsynaptic potential in electrical synapses is not caused by the opening of ion channels by chemical transmitters, but rather by direct electrical coupling between both neurons. Electrical synapses are faster than chemical synapses. Electrical synapses are found throughout the nervous system, including in the retina, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the neocortex, and in the hippocampus. While chemical synapses are found between both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, electrical synapses are most commonly found between smaller local inhibitory neurons. Electrical synapses can exist between two axons, two dendrites, or between an axon and a dendrite. In some fish and amphibians, electrical synapses can be found within the same terminal of a chemical synapse, as in Mauthner cells.

==Effects of drugs==
One of the most important features of chemical synapses is that they are the site of action for the majority of psychoactive drugs. Synapses are affected by drugs, such as curare, strychnine, cocaine, morphine, alcohol, LSD, and countless others. These drugs have different effects on synaptic function, and often are restricted to synapses that use a specific neurotransmitter. For example, curare is a poison that stops acetylcholine from depolarizing the postsynaptic membrane, causing paralysis. Strychnine blocks the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter glycine, which causes the body to pick up and react to weaker and previously ignored stimuli, resulting in uncontrollable muscle spasms. Morphine acts on synapses that use endorphin neurotransmitters, and alcohol increases the inhibitory effects of the neurotransmitter GABA. LSD interferes with synapses that use the neurotransmitter serotonin. Cocaine blocks reuptake of dopamine and therefore increases its effects.

==History and etymology==

During the 1950s, Bernard Katz and Paul Fatt observed spontaneous miniature synaptic currents at the frog neuromuscular junction. Based on these observations, they developed the &#x27;quantal hypothesis&#x27; that is the basis for our current understanding of neurotransmitter release as exocytosis and for which Katz received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1970. In the late 1960s, Ricardo Miledi and Katz advanced the hypothesis that depolarization-induced influx of calcium ions triggers exocytosis.

Sir Charles Scott Sherringtonin coined the word &#x27;synapse&#x27; and the history of the word was given by Sherrington in a letter he wrote to John Fulton:

<text>Multiple hypotheses explain the possible connections between sleep and learning in humans. Research indicates that sleep does more than allow the brain to rest; it may also aid the consolidation of long-term memories.

REM sleep and slow-wave sleep play different roles in memory consolidation. REM is associated with the consolidation of nondeclarative (implicit) memories. An example of a nondeclarative memory would be a task we can do without consciously thinking about, such as riding a bike. Slow-wave, or non-REM (NREM) sleep, consolidates declarative (explicit) memories. These are facts that need to be consciously remembered, such as dates for a history class.

==Increased learning==
Popular sayings can reflect the notion that remolded memories produce new creative associations in the morning, and that performance often improves after a time-interval that includes sleep. Current studies demonstrate that a healthy sleep produces a significant learning-dependent performance boost. The idea is that sleep helps the brain to edit its memory, looking for important patterns and extracting overarching rules which could be described as &#x27;the gist&#x27;, and integrating this with existing memory. The &#x27;synaptic scaling&#x27; hypothesis suggests that sleep plays an important role in regulating learning that has taken place while awake, enabling more efficient and effective storage in the brain, making better use of space and energy.

Healthy sleep must include the appropriate sequence and proportion of NREM and REM phases, which play different roles in the memory consolidation-optimization process. During a normal night of sleep, a person will alternate between periods of NREM and REM sleep. Each cycle is approximately 90 minutes long, containing a 20-30 minute bout of REM sleep. NREM sleep consists of sleep stages 1–4, and is where movement can be observed. A person can still move their body when they are in NREM sleep. If someone sleeping turns, tosses, or rolls over, this indicates that they are in NREM sleep. REM sleep is characterized by the lack of muscle activity. Physiological studies have shown that aside from the occasional twitch, a person actually becomes paralyzed during REM sleep. In motor skill learning, an interval of sleep may be critical for the expression of performance gains; without sleep these gains will be delayed.

Procedural memories are a form of nondeclarative memory, so they would most benefit from the fast-wave REM sleep. In a study, procedural memories have been shown to benefit from sleep. Subjects were tested using a tapping task, where they used their fingers to tap a specific sequence of numbers on a keyboard, and their performances were measured by accuracy and speed. This finger-tapping task was used to simulate learning a motor skill. The first group was tested, retested 12 hours later while awake, and finally tested another 12 hours later with sleep in between. The other group was tested, retested 12 hours later with sleep in between, and then retested 12 hours later while awake. The results showed that in both groups, there was only a slight improvement after a 12-hour wake session, but a significant increase in performance after each group slept. This study gives evidence that REM sleep is a significant factor in consolidating motor skill procedural memories, therefore sleep deprivation can impair performance on a motor learning task. This memory decrement results specifically from the loss of stage 2, REM sleep.

Declarative memory has also been shown to benefit from sleep, but not in the same way as procedural memory. Declarative memories benefit from the slow-waves nREM sleep. A study was conducted where the subjects learned word pairs, and the results showed that sleep not only prevents the decay of memory, but also actively fixates declarative memories. Two of the groups learned word pairs, then either slept or stayed awake, and were tested again. The other two groups did the same thing, except they also learned interference pairs right before being retested to try to disrupt the previously learned word pairs. The results showed that sleep was of &quot;some&quot; help in retaining the word pair associations, while against the interference pair, sleep helped &quot;significantly&quot;.

After sleep, there is increased insight. This is because sleep helps people to reanalyze their memories. The same patterns of brain activity that occur during learning have been found to occur again during sleep, only faster. One way that sleep strengthens memories is by weeding out the less successful connections between neurons in the brain. This weeding out is essential to prevent overactivity. The brain compensates for strengthening some synapses (connections) between neurons, by weakening others. The weakening process occurs mostly during sleep. This weakening during sleep allows for strengthening of other connections while we are awake. Learning is the process of strengthening connections, therefore this process could be a major explanation for the benefits that sleep has on memory.

Research has shown that taking an afternoon nap increases learning capacity. A study tested two groups of subjects on a nondeclarative memory task. One group engaged in REM sleep, and one group did not (meaning that they engaged in NREM sleep). The investigators found that the subjects who engaged only in NREM sleep did not show much improvement. The subjects who engaged in REM sleep performed significantly better, indicating that REM sleep facilitated the consolidation of nondeclarative memories. A more recent study demonstrated that a procedural task was learned and retained better if it was encountered immediately before going to sleep, while a declarative task was learned better in the afternoon.

==Electrophysiological evidence in rats==

A 2009 study based on electrophysiological recordings of large ensembles of isolated cells in the prefrontal cortex of rats revealed that cell assemblies that formed upon learning were more preferentially active during subsequent sleep episodes. More specifically, those replay events were more prominent during slow wave sleep and were concomitant with hippocampal reactivation events. This study has shown that neuronal patterns in large brain networks are tagged during learning so that they are replayed, and supposedly consolidated, during subsequent sleep. There have been other studies that have shown similar reactivation of learning pattern during motor skill and neuroprosthetic learning. Notably, new evidence is showing that reactivation and rescaling may be co-occurring during sleep.

==Sleep in relation to school==
Sleep has been directly linked to the grades of students. One in four U.S. high school students admit to falling asleep in class at least once a week. Consequently, results have shown that those who sleep less do poorly. In the United States, sleep deprivation is common with students because almost all schools begin early in the morning and many of these students either choose to stay awake late into the night or cannot do otherwise due to delayed sleep phase syndrome. As a result, students that should be getting between 8.5 and 9.25 hours of sleep are getting only 7 hours. Perhaps because of this sleep deprivation, their grades are lower and their concentration is impaired.

Research shows that different remote learning modalities significantly affect nursing students&#x27; perceptions of their sleep quality. During the COVID-19 pandemic, a study found that students engaged in asynchronous learning reported better sleep quality compared to those in hybrid or in-person learning environments. Over half of the nursing students surveyed reported getting less than the recommended 7 hours of sleep per night; however, students who reported more sleep hours also reported better sleep quality.

Given the significant impact of sleep deprivation on academic performance and the differing sleep patterns observed in students, educational institutions have begun to reconsider start times. For instance, a school in New Zealand changed its start time to 10:30 a.m. in 2006, to allow students to keep to a schedule that allowed more sleep. In 2009, Monkseaton High School, in North Tyneside, had 800 pupils aged 13–19 starting lessons at 10 a.m. instead of the normal 9 a.m. and reported that general absence dropped by 8% and persistent absenteeism by 27%. In 2024, some 20 schools in Denmark have pushed back their start times, and there have been positive results.

College students represent one of the most sleep-deprived segments of the population. Only 11% of American college students sleep well, and 40% of students feel well rested only two days per week. About 73% have experienced at least some occasional sleep issues. This poor sleep is thought to have a severe impact on their ability to learn and remember information because the brain is being deprived of time that it needs to consolidate information which is essential to the learning process.

<text>Systematics is the study of the diversification of living forms, both past and present, and the relationships among living things through time. Relationships are visualized as evolutionary trees (synonyms: phylogenetic trees, phylogenies). Phylogenies have two components: branching order (showing group relationships, graphically represented in cladograms) and branch length (showing amount of evolution). Phylogenetic trees of species and higher taxa are used to study the evolution of traits (e.g., anatomical or molecular characteristics) and the distribution of organisms (biogeography). Systematics, in other words, is used to understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth.

The word systematics is derived from the Latin word of Ancient Greek origin &quot;,&quot; which means systematic arrangement of organisms. Carl Linnaeus used &#x27;Systema Naturae&#x27; as the title of his book.

==Branches and applications==
In the study of biological systematics, researchers use the different branches to further understand the relationships between differing organisms. These branches are used to determine the applications and uses for modern day systematics.

Biological systematics classifies species by using three specific branches. &quot;Numerical systematics&quot;, or &quot;biometry&quot;, uses biological statistics to identify and classify animals. &quot;Biochemical systematics&quot; classifies and identifies animals based on the analysis of the material that makes up the living part of a cell—such as the nucleus, organelles, and cytoplasm. &quot;Experimental systematics&quot; identifies and classifies animals based on the evolutionary units that comprise a species, as well as their importance in evolution itself. Factors such as mutations, genetic divergence, and hybridization all are considered evolutionary units.

With the specific branches, researchers are able to determine the applications and uses for modern-day systematics. These applications include: 
* Studying the diversity of organisms and the differentiation between extinct and living creatures. Biologists study the well-understood relationships by making many different diagrams and &quot;trees&quot; (cladograms, phylogenetic trees, phylogenies, etc.). 
* Including the scientific names of organisms, species descriptions and overviews, taxonomic orders, and classifications of evolutionary and organism histories.

==Definition and relation with taxonomy==

John Lindley provided an early definition of systematics in 1830, although he wrote of &quot;systematic botany&quot; rather than using the term &quot;systematics&quot;.

In 1970 Michener &quot;et al.&quot; defined &quot;systematic biology&quot; and &quot;taxonomy&quot; (terms that are often confused and used interchangeably) in relationship to one another as follows:
Systematic biology (hereafter called simply systematics) is the field that (a) provides scientific names for organisms, (b) describes them, (c) preserves collections of them, (d) provides classifications for the organisms, keys for their identification, and data on their distributions, (e) investigates their evolutionary histories, and (f) considers their environmental adaptations. This is a field with a long history that in recent years has experienced a notable renaissance, principally with respect to theoretical content. Part of the theoretical material has to do with evolutionary areas (topics e and f above), the rest relates especially to the problem of classification. Taxonomy is that part of Systematics concerned with topics (a) to (d) above.
The term &quot;taxonomy&quot; was coined by Augustin Pyramus de Candolle while the term &quot;systematic&quot; was coined by Carl Linnaeus the father of taxonomy.

Taxonomy, systematic biology, systematics, biosystematics, scientific classification, biological classification, phylogenetics: At various times in history, all these words have had overlapping, related meanings. However, in modern usage, they can all be considered synonyms of each other.

For example, Webster&#x27;s 9th New Collegiate Dictionary of 1987 treats &quot;classification&quot;, &quot;taxonomy&quot;, and &quot;systematics&quot; as synonyms. According to this work, the terms originated in 1790, c. 1828, and in 1888 respectively. Some claim systematics alone deals specifically with relationships through time, and that it can be synonymous with phylogenetics, broadly dealing with the inferred hierarchy of organisms. This means it would be a subset of taxonomy as it is sometimes regarded, but the inverse is claimed by others.

Europeans tend to use the terms &quot;systematics&quot; and &quot;biosystematics&quot; for the study of biodiversity as a whole, whereas North Americans tend to use &quot;taxonomy&quot; more frequently. However, taxonomy, and in particular alpha taxonomy, is more specifically the identification, description, and naming (i.e. nomenclature) of organisms,
while &quot;classification&quot; focuses on placing organisms within hierarchical groups that show their relationships to other organisms. All of these biological disciplines can deal with both extinct and extant organisms.

Systematics uses taxonomy as a primary tool in understanding, as nothing about an organism&#x27;s relationships with other living things can be understood without it first being properly studied and described in sufficient detail to identify and classify it correctly. Scientific classifications are aids in recording and reporting information to other scientists and to laymen. The systematist, a scientist who specializes in systematics, must, therefore, be able to use existing classification systems, or at least know them well enough to skilfully justify not using them.

Phenetics was an attempt to determine the relationships of organisms through a measure of overall similarity, making no distinction between plesiomorphies (shared ancestral traits) and apomorphies (derived traits). From the late-20th century onwards, it was superseded by cladistics, which rejects plesiomorphies in attempting to resolve the phylogeny of Earth&#x27;s various organisms through time. systematists generally make extensive use of molecular biology and of computer programs to study organisms.

==Taxonomic characters==
Taxonomic characters are the taxonomic attributes that can be used to provide the evidence from which relationships (the phylogeny) between taxa are inferred. Kinds of taxonomic characters include:
* Morphological characters
** General external morphology
** Special structures (e.g. genitalia)
** Internal morphology (anatomy)
** Embryology
** Karyology and other cytological factors
* Physiological characters
** Metabolic factors
** Body secretions
** Genic sterility factors
* Molecular characters
** Immunological distance
** Electrophoretic differences
** Amino acid sequences of proteins
** DNA hybridization
** DNA and RNA sequences
** Restriction endonuclease analyses
** Other molecular differences

* Behavioral characters
** Courtship and other ethological isolating mechanisms
** Other behavior patterns
* Ecological characters
** Habit and habitats
** Food
** Seasonal variations
** Parasites and hosts
* Geographic characters
** General biogeographic distribution patterns
** Sympatric-allopatric relationship of populations

<doc id="27834" wikidata="Q35831" url="?curid=27834" title="Sleep">
<text>Sleep is a state of reduced mental and physical activity in which consciousness is altered and certain sensory activity is inhibited. During sleep, there is a marked decrease in muscle activity and interactions with the surrounding environment. While sleep differs from wakefulness in terms of the ability to react to stimuli, it still involves active brain patterns, making it more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness.

Sleep occurs in repeating periods, during which the body alternates between two distinct modes: REM and non-REM sleep. Although REM stands for &quot;rapid eye movement&quot;, this mode of sleep has many other aspects, including virtual paralysis of the body. Dreams are a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep.

During sleep, most of the body&#x27;s systems are in an anabolic state, helping to restore the immune, nervous, skeletal, and muscular systems; these are vital processes that maintain mood, memory, and cognitive function, and play a large role in the function of the endocrine and immune systems. The internal circadian clock promotes sleep daily at night, when it is dark. The diverse purposes and mechanisms of sleep are the subject of substantial ongoing research. Sleep is a highly conserved behavior across animal evolution, likely going back hundreds of millions of years, and originating as a means for the brain to cleanse itself of waste products. In a major breakthrough, researchers have found that this cleansing may be a core purpose of sleep.

Humans may suffer from various sleep disorders, including dyssomnias, such as insomnia, hypersomnia, narcolepsy, and sleep apnea; parasomnias, such as sleepwalking and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder; bruxism; and circadian rhythm sleep disorders. The use of artificial light has substantially altered humanity&#x27;s sleep patterns. Common sources of artificial light include outdoor lighting and the screens of electronic devices such as smartphones and televisions, which emit large amounts of blue light, a form of light typically associated with daytime. This disrupts the release of the hormone melatonin needed to regulate the sleep cycle.

== Physiology ==

The most pronounced physiological changes in sleep occur in the brain. The brain uses significantly less energy during sleep than it does when awake, especially during non-REM sleep. In areas with reduced activity, the brain restores its supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the molecule used for short-term storage and transport of energy. In quiet waking, the brain is responsible for 20% of the body&#x27;s energy use, thus this reduction has a noticeable effect on overall energy consumption.

Sleep increases the sensory threshold. In other words, sleeping persons perceive fewer stimuli, but can generally still respond to loud noises and other salient sensory events.

During slow-wave sleep, humans secrete bursts of growth hormone. All sleep, even during the day, is associated with the secretion of prolactin.

Key physiological methods for monitoring and measuring changes during sleep include electroencephalography (EEG) of brain waves, electrooculography (EOG) of eye movements, and electromyography (EMG) of skeletal muscle activity. Simultaneous collection of these measurements is called polysomnography, and can be performed in a specialized sleep laboratory. Sleep researchers also use simplified electrocardiography (EKG) for cardiac activity and actigraphy for motor movements.

=== Brain waves in sleep ===
The electrical activity seen on an EEG represents brain waves. The amplitude of EEG waves at a particular frequency corresponds to various points in the sleep-wake cycle, such as being asleep, being awake, or falling asleep. Alpha, beta, theta, gamma, and delta waves are all seen in the different stages of sleep. Each waveform maintains a different frequency and amplitude. Alpha waves are seen when a person is in a resting state, but is still fully conscious. Their eyes may be closed and all of their body is resting and relatively still, where the body is starting to slow down. Beta waves take over alpha waves when a person is at attention, as they might be completing a task or concentrating on something. Beta waves consist of the highest of frequencies and the lowest of amplitude, and occur when a person is fully alert. Gamma waves are seen when a person is highly focused on a task or using all their concentration. Theta waves occur during the period of a person being awake, and they continue to transition into Stage 1 of sleep and in stage 2. Delta waves are seen in stages 3 and 4 of sleep when a person is in their deepest of sleep.

===Non-REM and REM sleep===
Sleep is divided into two broad types: non-rapid eye movement (non-REM or NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Non-REM and REM sleep are so different that physiologists identify them as distinct behavioral states. Non-REM sleep occurs first and after a transitional period is called slow-wave sleep or deep sleep. During this phase, body temperature and heart rate fall, and the brain uses less energy. REM sleep, also known as paradoxical sleep, represents a smaller portion of total sleep time. It is the main occasion for dreams (or nightmares), and is associated with desynchronized and fast brain waves, eye movements, loss of muscle tone, and suspension of homeostasis.

The sleep cycle of alternate NREM and REM sleep takes an average of 90 minutes, occurring 4–6 times in a good night&#x27;s sleep. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) divides NREM into three stages: N1, N2, and N3, the last of which is also called delta sleep or slow-wave sleep. The whole period normally proceeds in the order: N1 → N2 → N3 → N2 → REM. REM sleep occurs as a person returns to stage 2 or 1 from a deep sleep. There is a greater amount of deep sleep (stage N3) earlier in the night, while the proportion of REM sleep increases in the two cycles just before natural awakening.

=== Awakening ===

Awakening can mean the end of sleep, or simply a moment to survey the environment and readjust body position before falling back asleep. Sleepers typically awaken soon after the end of a REM phase or sometimes in the middle of REM. Internal circadian indicators, along with a successful reduction of homeostatic sleep need, typically bring about awakening and the end of the sleep cycle. Awakening involves heightened electrical activation in the brain, beginning with the thalamus and spreading throughout the cortex.

On a typical night of sleep, there is not much time that is spent in the waking state. In various sleep studies that have been conducted using the electroencephalography, it has been found that females are awake for 0–1% during their nightly sleep while males are awake for 0–2% during that time. In adults, wakefulness increases, especially in later cycles. One study found 3% awake time in the first ninety-minute sleep cycle, 8% in the second, 10% in the third, 12% in the fourth, and 13–14% in the fifth. Most of this awake time occurred shortly after REM sleep.

Today, many humans wake up with an alarm clock; however, people can also reliably wake themselves up at a specific time with no need for an alarm. Many sleep quite differently on workdays versus days off, a pattern which can lead to chronic circadian desynchronization. Many people regularly look at television and other screens before going to bed, a factor which may exacerbate disruption of the circadian cycle. Scientific studies on sleep have shown that sleep stage at awakening is an important factor in amplifying sleep inertia.

Determinants of alertness after waking up include quantity/quality of the sleep, physical activity the day prior, a carbohydrate-rich breakfast, and a low blood glucose response to it.

== Timing ==
Sleep timing is controlled by the circadian clock (Process C), sleep-wake homeostasis (Process S), and to some extent by the individual will.

=== Circadian clock ===


Sleep timing depends greatly on hormonal signals from the circadian clock, or Process C, a complex neurochemical system which uses signals from an organism&#x27;s environment to recreate an internal day–night rhythm. Process C counteracts the homeostatic drive for sleep during the day (in diurnal animals) and augments it at night. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a brain area directly above the optic chiasm, is presently considered the most important nexus for this process; however, secondary clock systems have been found throughout the body.

An organism whose circadian clock exhibits a regular rhythm corresponding to outside signals is said to be &quot;entrained&quot;; an entrained rhythm persists even if the outside signals suddenly disappear. If an entrained human is isolated in a bunker with constant light or darkness, he or she will continue to experience rhythmic increases and decreases of body temperature and melatonin, on a period that slightly exceeds 24 hours. Scientists refer to such conditions as free-running of the circadian rhythm. Under natural conditions, light signals regularly adjust this period downward, so that it corresponds better with the exact 24 hours of an Earth day.

The circadian clock exerts constant influence on the body, affecting sinusoidal oscillation of body temperature between roughly 36.2 °C and 37.2 °C. The suprachiasmatic nucleus itself shows conspicuous oscillation activity, which intensifies during subjective day (i.e., the part of the rhythm corresponding with daytime, whether accurately or not) and drops to almost nothing during subjective night. The circadian pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nucleus has a direct neural connection to the pineal gland, which releases the hormone melatonin at night. Cortisol levels typically rise throughout the night, peak in the awakening hours, and diminish during the day. Circadian prolactin secretion begins in the late afternoon, especially in women, and is subsequently augmented by sleep-induced secretion, to peak in the middle of the night. Circadian rhythm exerts some influence on the nighttime secretion of growth hormone.

The circadian rhythm influences the ideal timing of a restorative sleep episode. Sleepiness increases during the night. REM sleep occurs more during body temperature minimum within the circadian cycle, whereas slow-wave sleep can occur more independently of circadian time.

The internal circadian clock is profoundly influenced by changes in light, since these are its main clues about what time it is. Exposure to even small amounts of light during the night can suppress melatonin secretion, and increase body temperature and wakefulness. Short pulses of light, at the right moment in the circadian cycle, can significantly &#x27;reset&#x27; the internal clock. Blue light, in particular, exerts the strongest effect, leading to concerns that use of a screen before bed may interfere with sleep.

Modern humans often find themselves desynchronized from their internal circadian clock, due to the requirements of work (especially night shifts), long-distance travel, and the influence of universal indoor lighting. Even if they have sleep debt, or feel sleepy, people can have difficulty staying asleep at the peak of their circadian cycle. Conversely, they can have difficulty waking up in the trough of the cycle. A healthy young adult entrained to the sun will (during most of the year) fall asleep a few hours after sunset, experience body temperature minimum at 6 a.m., and wake up a few hours after sunrise.

=== Process S ===

Generally speaking, the longer an organism is awake, the more it feels a need to sleep (&quot;sleep debt&quot;). This driver of sleep is referred to as Process S. The balance between sleeping and waking is regulated by a process called homeostasis. Induced or perceived lack of sleep is called sleep deprivation.

Process S is driven by the depletion of glycogen and accumulation of adenosine in the forebrain that disinhibits the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus, allowing for inhibition of the ascending reticular activating system.

Sleep deprivation tends to cause slower brain waves in the frontal cortex, shortened attention span, higher anxiety, impaired memory, and a grouchy mood. Conversely, a well-rested organism tends to have improved memory and mood. Neurophysiological and functional imaging studies have demonstrated that frontal regions of the brain are particularly responsive to homeostatic sleep pressure.

There is disagreement on how much sleep debt is possible to accumulate, and whether sleep debt is accumulated against an individual&#x27;s average sleep or some other benchmark. It is also unclear whether the prevalence of sleep debt among adults has changed appreciably in the industrialized world in recent decades. Sleep debt does show some evidence of being cumulative. Subjectively, however, humans seem to reach maximum sleepiness 30 hours after waking. It is likely that in Western societies, children are sleeping less than they previously have.

One neurochemical indicator of sleep debt is adenosine, a neurotransmitter that inhibits many of the bodily processes associated with wakefulness. Adenosine levels increase in the cortex and basal forebrain during prolonged wakefulness, and decrease during the sleep-recovery period, potentially acting as a homeostatic regulator of sleep. Coffee, tea, and other sources of caffeine temporarily block the effect of adenosine, prolong sleep latency, and reduce total sleep time and quality.

=== Social timing ===
Humans are also influenced by aspects of &quot;social time&quot;, such as the hours when other people are awake, the hours when work is required, the time on clocks, etc. Time zones, standard times used to unify the timing for people in the same area, correspond only approximately to the natural rising and setting of the sun. An extreme example of the approximate nature of time zones is China, a country which used to span five time zones and now officially uses only one (UTC+8).

=== Distribution ===
In polyphasic sleep, an organism sleeps several times in a 24-hour cycle, whereas in monophasic sleep this occurs all at once. Under experimental conditions, humans tend to alternate more frequently between sleep and wakefulness (i.e., exhibit more polyphasic sleep) if they have nothing better to do. Given a 14-hour period of darkness in experimental conditions, humans tended towards bimodal sleep, with two sleep periods concentrated at the beginning and at the end of the dark time. Bimodal sleep in humans was more common before the Industrial Revolution.

Different characteristic sleep patterns, such as the familiarly so-called &quot;early bird&quot; and &quot;night owl&quot;, are called &quot;chronotypes&quot;. Genetics and sex have some influence on chronotype, but so do habits. Chronotype is also liable to change over the course of a person&#x27;s lifetime. Seven-year-olds are better disposed to wake up early in the morning than are fifteen-year-olds. Chronotypes far outside the normal range are called circadian rhythm sleep disorders.

====Naps====
Naps are short periods of sleep that one might take during the daytime, often in order to get the necessary amount of rest. Napping is often associated with childhood, but around one-third of American adults partake in it daily. The optimal nap duration is around 10–20 minutes, as researchers have proven that it takes at least 30 minutes to enter slow-wave sleep, the deepest period of sleep. Napping too long and entering the slow wave cycles can make it difficult to awake from the nap and leave one feeling unrested. This period of drowsiness is called sleep inertia.
The siesta habit has recently been associated with a 37% lower coronary mortality, possibly due to reduced cardiovascular stress mediated by daytime sleep. Short naps at mid-day and mild evening exercise were found to be effective for improved sleep, cognitive tasks, and mental health in elderly people.

=== Genetics ===
Monozygotic (identical) but not dizygotic (fraternal) twins tend to have similar sleep habits. Neurotransmitters, molecules whose production can be traced to specific genes, are one genetic influence on sleep that can be analyzed. The circadian clock has its own set of genes. Genes which may influence sleep include ABCC9, DEC2, Dopamine receptor D2 and variants near PAX 8 and VRK2. While the latter have been found in a GWAS study that primarily detects correlations (but not necessarily causation), other genes have been shown to have a more direct effect. For instance, mice lacking dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (Dpyd) had 78.4 min less sleep during the lights-off period than wild-type mice. Dpyd encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in the metabolic pathway that catabolizes uracil and thymidine to β-alanine, an inhibitory neurotransmitter. This also supports the role of β-alanine as a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep in mice.

==== Genes for short sleep duration ====
 The genes DEC2, ADRB1, NPSR1 and GRM1 are implicated in enabling short sleep.

=== Quality ===
The quality of sleep may be evaluated from an objective and a subjective point of view. Objective sleep quality refers to how difficult it is for a person to fall asleep and remain in a sleeping state, and how many times they wake up during a single night. Poor sleep quality disrupts the cycle of transition between the different stages of sleep. Subjective sleep quality in turn refers to a sense of being rested and regenerated after awaking from sleep. A study by A. Harvey et al. (2002) found that insomniacs were more demanding in their evaluations of sleep quality than individuals who had no sleep problems.

Homeostatic sleep propensity (the need for sleep as a function of the amount of time elapsed since the last adequate sleep episode) must be balanced against the circadian element for satisfactory sleep. Along with corresponding messages from the circadian clock, this tells the body it needs to sleep. The timing is correct when the following two circadian markers occur after the middle of the sleep episode and before awakening: maximum concentration of the hormone melatonin, and minimum core body temperature.

== Ideal duration ==

Human sleep-needs vary by age and amongst individuals; sleep is considered to be adequate when there is no daytime sleepiness or dysfunction. Moreover, self-reported sleep duration is only moderately correlated with actual sleep time as measured by actigraphy, and those affected with sleep state misperception may typically report having slept only four hours despite having slept a full eight hours.

Researchers have found that sleeping 6–7 hours each night correlates with longevity and cardiac health in humans, though many underlying factors may be involved in the causality behind this relationship.

Sleep difficulties are furthermore associated with psychiatric disorders such as depression, alcoholism, and bipolar disorder. Up to 90 percent of adults with depression are found to have sleep difficulties. Dysregulation detected by EEG includes disturbances in sleep continuity, decreased delta sleep and altered REM patterns with regard to latency, distribution across the night and density of eye movements.

Sleep duration can also vary according to season. Up to 90% of people report longer sleep duration in winter, which may lead to more pronounced seasonal affective disorder.

=== Children ===

By the time infants reach the age of two, their brain size has reached 90 percent of an adult-sized brain; a majority of this brain growth has occurred during the period of life with the highest rate of sleep. The hours that children spend asleep influence their ability to perform on cognitive tasks. Children who sleep through the night and have few night waking episodes have higher cognitive attainments and easier temperaments than other children.

Sleep also influences language development. To test this, researchers taught infants a faux language and observed their recollection of the rules for that language. Infants who slept within four hours of learning the language could remember the language rules better, while infants who stayed awake longer did not recall those rules as well. There is also a relationship between infants&#x27; vocabulary and sleeping: infants who sleep longer at night at 12 months have better vocabularies at 26 months.

Children can greatly benefit from a structured bedtime routine. This can look differently among families, but will generally consist of a set of rituals such as reading a bedtime story, a bath, brushing teeth, and can also include a show of affection from the parent to the child such as a hug or kiss before bed. A bedtime routine will also include a consistent time that the child is expected to be in bed ready for sleep. Having a reliable bedtime routine can help improve a child&#x27;s quality of sleep as well as prepare them to make and keep healthy sleep hygiene habits in the future.

=== Recommended duration ===
Children need many hours of sleep per day in order to develop and function properly: up to 18 hours for newborn babies, with a declining rate as a child ages. Early in 2015, after a two-year study, the National Sleep Foundation in the US announced newly revised recommendations as shown in the table below.

== Functions ==
===Restoration===
The sleeping brain has been shown to remove metabolic end products at a faster rate than during an awake state, by increasing the flow of cerebrospinal fluid during sleep. The mechanism for this removal appears to be the glymphatic system, a system that does for the brain what the lymphatic system does for the body. Further research has shown that the glymphatic system is driven by pulses of hormones that in turn create surges in blood flow that cause the cerebrospinal fluid to flow, carrying away metabolites.

Sleep may facilitate the synthesis of molecules that help repair and protect the brain from metabolic end products generated during waking. Anabolic hormones, such as growth hormones, are secreted preferentially during sleep. The brain concentration of glycogen increases during sleep, and is depleted through metabolism during wakefulness.

The human organism physically restores itself during sleep, occurring mostly during slow-wave sleep during which body temperature, heart rate, and brain oxygen consumption decrease. In both the brain and body, the reduced rate of metabolism enables countervailing restorative processes. While the body benefits from sleep, the brain actually requires sleep for restoration, whereas these processes can take place during quiescent waking in the rest of the body. The essential function of sleep may be its restorative effect on the brain: &quot;Sleep is of the brain, by the brain and for the brain.&quot; Furthermore, this includes almost any brain, no matter how small: sleep is observed to be a necessary behavior across most of the animal kingdom, including some of the least cognitively advanced animals, implying that sleep is essential to the most fundamental brain processes, i.e. neuronal firing. This shows that sleep is vital even when there is no need for other functions of sleep, such as memory consolidation or dreaming.

=== Memory processing ===
It has been widely accepted that sleep must support the formation of long-term memory, and generally increasing previous learning and experiences recalls. However, its benefit seems to depend on the phase of sleep and the type of memory. For example, declarative and procedural memory-recall tasks applied over early and late nocturnal sleep, as well as wakefulness controlled conditions, have been shown that declarative memory improves more during early sleep (dominated by SWS) while procedural memory during late sleep (dominated by REM sleep) does so.

With regard to declarative memory, the functional role of SWS has been associated with hippocampal replays of previously encoded neural patterns that seem to facilitate long-term memory consolidation. This assumption is based on the active system consolidation hypothesis, which states that repeated reactivations of newly encoded information in the hippocampus during slow oscillations in NREM sleep mediate the stabilization and gradual integration of declarative memory with pre-existing knowledge networks on the cortical level. It assumes the hippocampus might hold information only temporarily and in a fast-learning rate, whereas the neocortex is related to long-term storage and a slow-learning rate. This dialogue between the hippocampus and neocortex occurs in parallel with hippocampal sharp-wave ripples and thalamo-cortical spindles, synchrony that drives the formation of the spindle-ripple event which seems to be a prerequisite for the formation of long-term memories.

Reactivation of memory also occurs during wakefulness and its function is associated with serving to update the reactivated memory with newly encoded information, whereas reactivations during SWS are presented as crucial for memory stabilization. Based on targeted memory reactivation (TMR) experiments that use associated memory cues to triggering memory traces during sleep, several studies have been reassuring the importance of nocturnal reactivations for the formation of persistent memories in neocortical networks, as well as highlighting the possibility of increasing people&#x27;s memory performance at declarative recalls.

Furthermore, nocturnal reactivation seems to share the same neural oscillatory patterns as reactivation during wakefulness, processes which might be coordinated by theta activity. During wakefulness, theta oscillations have been often related to successful performance in memory tasks, and cued memory reactivations during sleep have been showing that theta activity is significantly stronger in subsequent recognition of cued stimuli as compared to uncued ones, possibly indicating a strengthening of memory traces and lexical integration by cuing during sleep. However, the beneficial effect of TMR for memory consolidation seems to occur only if the cued memories can be related to prior knowledge.

=== Dreaming ===

During sleep, especially REM sleep, humans tend to experience dreams. These are elusive and mostly unpredictable first-person experiences which seem logical and realistic to the dreamer while they are in progress, despite their frequently bizarre, irrational, and/or surreal qualities that become apparent when assessed after waking. Dreams often seamlessly incorporate concepts, situations, people, and objects within a person&#x27;s mind that would not normally go together. They can include apparent sensations of all types, especially vision and movement.

Dreams tend to rapidly fade from memory after waking. Some people choose to keep a dream journal, which they believe helps them build dream recall and facilitate the ability to experience lucid dreams.

A lucid dream is a type of dream in which the dreamer becomes aware that they are dreaming while dreaming. In a preliminary study, dreamers were able to consciously communicate with experimenters via eye movements or facial muscle signals, and were able to comprehend complex questions and use working memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1016/j.cub.2021.01.026&quot;&gt; Available under CC BY 4.0 .&lt;/ref&gt;

People have proposed many hypotheses about the functions of dreaming. Sigmund Freud postulated that dreams are the symbolic expression of frustrated desires that have been relegated to the unconscious mind, and he used dream interpretation in the form of psychoanalysis in attempting to uncover these desires.

Counterintuitively, penile erections during sleep are not more frequent during sexual dreams than during other dreams. The parasympathetic nervous system experiences increased activity during REM sleep which may cause erection of the penis or clitoris. In males, 80% to 95% of REM sleep is normally accompanied by partial to full penile erection, while only about 12% of men&#x27;s dreams contain sexual content.

==Disorders==
===Insomnia===
Insomnia is a general term for difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep. Insomnia is the most common sleep problem, with many adults reporting occasional insomnia, and 10–15% reporting a chronic condition. Insomnia can have many different causes, including psychological stress, a poor sleep environment, an inconsistent sleep schedule, or excessive mental or physical stimulation in the hours before bedtime. Insomnia is often treated through behavioral changes like keeping a regular sleep schedule, avoiding stimulating or stressful activities before bedtime, and cutting down on stimulants such as caffeine. The sleep environment may be improved by installing heavy drapes to shut out all sunlight, and keeping computers, televisions, and work materials out of the sleeping area.

A 2010 review of published scientific research suggested that exercise generally improves sleep for most people, and helps sleep disorders such as insomnia. The optimum time to exercise &quot;may&quot; be 4 to 8 hours before bedtime, though exercise at any time of day is beneficial, with the exception of heavy exercise taken shortly before bedtime, which may disturb sleep. However, there is insufficient evidence to draw detailed conclusions about the relationship between exercise and sleep. Nonbenzodiazepine sleeping medications such as Ambien, Imovane, and Lunesta (also known as &quot;Z-drugs&quot;), while initially believed to be better and safer than earlier generations of including benzodiazepine are now known to be almost entirely the same as benzodiazepines in terms of their pharmacodynamics, differing only at the molecular level in their chemical structure, and therefore exhibit similar benefits, side-effects, and risks. White noise appears to be a promising treatment for insomnia.

==Sleep health==
===Sleep duration and quality===
Sleep duration measures the length of sleep, whereas sleep quality includes factors such as speed in falling asleep and whether sleep is unbroken. Adequate quality sleep is linked with better mood and the abilities to express and quickly process emotion.

Low quality sleep has been linked with health conditions like cardiovascular disease, obesity, and mental illness. While poor sleep is common among those with cardiovascular disease, some research indicates that poor sleep can be a contributing cause. Short sleep duration of less than seven hours is correlated with coronary heart disease and increased risk of death from coronary heart disease. Sleep duration greater than nine hours is also correlated with coronary heart disease, as well as stroke and cardiovascular events.

In both children and adults, short sleep duration is associated with an increased risk of obesity, with various studies reporting an increased risk of 45–55%. Other aspects of sleep health have been associated with obesity, including daytime napping, sleep timing, the variability of sleep timing, and low sleep efficiency. However, sleep duration is the most-studied for its impact on obesity.

Sleep problems have been frequently viewed as a symptom of mental illness rather than a causative factor. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that they are both a cause and a symptom of mental illness. Insomnia is a significant predictor of major depressive disorder; a meta-analysis of 170,000 people showed that insomnia at the beginning of a study period indicated a more than the twofold increased risk for major depressive disorder. Some studies have also indicated correlation between insomnia and anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and suicide. Sleep disorders can increase the risk of psychosis and worsen the severity of psychotic episodes.

Sleep research also displays differences in race and class. Short sleep and poor sleep are observed more frequently in ethnic minorities than in whites in the US. African-Americans report experiencing short durations of sleep five times more often than whites, possibly as a result of social and environmental factors. A study done in the USA suggested that higher rates of sleep apnea (and poorer responses to treatment) are suffered by children in disadvantaged neighborhoods (which, in context, includes a disproportionate effect on children of African-American descent).

===Sleep hygiene===
Sleep health can be improved through implementing good sleep hygiene habits. Having good sleep hygiene can help to improve your physical and mental health by providing your body with the necessary rejuvenation only restful sleep can provide. Some ways to improve sleep health include going to sleep at consistent times every night, avoiding any electronic devices such as televisions in the bedroom, getting adequate exercise throughout your day, and avoiding caffeine in the hours before going to sleep. Another way to greatly improve sleep hygiene is by creating a peaceful and relaxing sleep environment. Sleeping in a dark and clean room with things like a white noise maker can help facilitate restful sleep. However, noise, with the exception of white noise, may not be good for sleep.

==Drugs and diet==

Drugs which induce sleep, known as hypnotics, include benzodiazepines (although these interfere with REM); nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics such as eszopiclone (Lunesta), zaleplon (Sonata), and zolpidem (Ambien); antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and doxylamine; alcohol (ethanol), (which exerts an excitatory rebound effect later in the night and intereferes with REM) barbiturates (which have the same problem), melatonin (a component of the circadian clock) and cannabis (which may also interfere with REM). Some opioids (including morphine, codeine, heroin, and oxycodone) also induce sleep, and can disrupt sleep architecture and sleep stage distribution. The endogenously produced drug gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is capable of producing high quality sleep that is indistinguishable from natural sleep architecture in humans.

Stimulants, which inhibit sleep, include caffeine, an adenosine antagonist; amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, empathogen-entactogens, and related drugs; cocaine, which can alter the circadian rhythm, and methylphenidate, which acts similarly; and eugeroic drugs like modafinil and armodafinil with poorly understood mechanisms. Consuming high amounts of the stimulant caffeine can result in interrupted sleep patterns and sometimes sleep deprivation. This vicious cycle can result in drowsiness which can then result in a higher consumption of caffeine in order to stay awake the next day. This cycle can lead to decreased cognitive function and an overall feeling of fatigue.

Some drugs may alter sleep architecture without inhibiting or inducing sleep. Drugs that amplify or inhibit endocrine and immune system secretions associated with certain sleep stages have been shown to alter sleep architecture. The growth hormone releasing hormone receptor agonist MK-677 has been shown to increase REM in older adults as well as stage IV sleep in younger adults by approximately 50%.

===Diet===
Dietary and nutritional choices may affect sleep duration and quality. One 2016 review indicated that a high-carbohydrate diet promoted a shorter onset to sleep and a longer duration of sleep than a high-fat diet. A 2012 investigation indicated that mixed micronutrients and macronutrients are needed to promote quality sleep. A varied diet containing fresh fruits and vegetables, low saturated fat, and whole grains may be optimal for individuals seeking to improve sleep quality. Epidemiological studies indicate fewer insomnia symptoms and better sleep quality with a Mediterranean diet. Two studies have indicated a benefit of tart cherry juice for insomnia, or for increasing sleep efficiency as well as total sleep time. High-quality clinical trials on long-term dietary practices are needed to better define the influence of diet on sleep quality.

==In culture==

===Anthropology===
Research suggests that sleep patterns vary significantly across cultures. The most striking differences are observed between societies that have plentiful sources of artificial light and ones that do not. The primary difference appears to be that pre-light cultures have more broken-up sleep patterns. For example, people without artificial light might go to sleep far sooner after the sun sets, but then wake up several times throughout the night, punctuating their sleep with periods of wakefulness, perhaps lasting several hours. During pre-industrial Europe, biphasic (bimodal) sleeping was considered the norm. Sleep onset was determined not by a set bedtime, but by whether there were things to do.

The boundaries between sleeping and waking are blurred in these societies. Some observers believe that nighttime sleep in these societies is most often split into two main periods, the first characterized primarily by deep sleep and the second by REM sleep.

Some societies display a fragmented sleep pattern in which people sleep at all times of the day and night for shorter periods. In many nomadic or hunter-gatherer societies, people sleep on and off throughout the day or night depending on what is happening. Plentiful artificial light has been available in the industrialized West since at least the mid-19th century, and sleep patterns have changed significantly everywhere that lighting has been introduced. In general, people sleep in a more concentrated burst through the night, going to sleep much later, although this is not always the case.

Historian A. Roger Ekirch thinks that the traditional pattern of &quot;segmented sleep,&quot; as it is called, began to disappear among the urban upper class in Europe in the late 17th century and the change spread over the next 200 years; by the 1920s &quot;the idea of a first and second sleep had receded entirely from our social consciousness.&quot; Ekirch attributes the change to increases in &quot;street lighting, domestic lighting and a surge in coffee houses,&quot; which slowly made nighttime a legitimate time for activity, decreasing the time available for rest. Today in most societies people sleep during the night, but in very hot climates they may sleep during the day. During Ramadan, many Muslims sleep during the day rather than at night.

In some societies, people sleep with at least one other person (sometimes many) or with animals. In other cultures, people rarely sleep with anyone except for an intimate partner. In almost all societies, sleeping partners are strongly regulated by social standards. For example, a person might only sleep with the immediate family, the extended family, a spouse or romantic partner, children, children of a certain age, children of a specific gender, peers of a certain gender, friends, peers of equal social rank, or with no one at all. Sleep may be an actively social time, depending on the sleep groupings, with no constraints on noise or activity.

People sleep in a variety of locations. Some sleep directly on the ground; others on a skin or blanket; others sleep on platforms or beds. Some sleep with blankets, some with pillows, some with simple headrests, some with no head support. These choices are shaped by a variety of factors, such as climate, protection from predators, housing type, technology, personal preference, and the incidence of pests.

===In mythology and literature===

Sleep has been seen in culture as similar to death since antiquity; in Greek mythology, Hypnos (the god of sleep) and Thanatos (the god of death) were both said to be the children of Nyx (the goddess of night). John Donne, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats and other poets have all written poems about the relationship between sleep and death. Shelley describes them as &quot;both so passing, strange and wonderful!&quot; Keats similarly poses the question: &quot;Can death be sleep, when life is but a dream&quot;. Many people consider dying in one&#x27;s sleep is the most peaceful way to die. Phrases such as &quot;big sleep&quot; and &quot;rest in peace&quot; are often used in reference to death, possibly in an effort to lessen its finality. Sleep and dreaming have sometimes been seen as providing the potential for visionary experiences. In medieval Irish tradition, in order to become a filí, the poet was required to undergo a ritual called the &quot;imbas forosnai&quot;, in which they would enter a mantic, trancelike sleep.

Many cultural stories have been told about people falling asleep for extended periods of time. The earliest of these stories is the ancient Greek legend of Epimenides of Knossos. According to the biographer Diogenes Laërtius, Epimenides was a shepherd on the Greek island of Crete. One day, one of his sheep went missing and he went out to look for it, but became tired and fell asleep in a cave under Mount Ida. When he awoke, he continued searching for the sheep, but could not find it, so he returned to his old farm, only to discover that it was now under new ownership. He went to his hometown, but discovered that nobody there knew him. Finally, he met his younger brother, who was now an old man, and learned that he had been asleep in the cave for fifty-seven years.

A far more famous instance of a &quot;long sleep&quot; today is the Christian legend of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, in which seven Christians flee into a cave during pagan times in order to escape persecution, but fall asleep and wake up 360 years later to discover, to their astonishment, that the Roman Empire is now predominantly Christian. The American author Washington Irving&#x27;s short story &quot;Rip Van Winkle&quot;, first published in 1819 in his collection of short stories &quot;The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent.&quot;, is about a man in colonial America named Rip Van Winkle who falls asleep on one of the Catskill Mountains and wakes up twenty years later after the American Revolution. The story is now considered one of the greatest classics of American literature.

===In studies on consciousness and philosophy===
As an altered state of consciousness, dreamless deep sleep has been used as a way to investigate animal/human consciousness and qualia. Insights about differences of the living sleeping brain to its wakeful state and the transition period may have implications for potential explanations of human subjective experience, the so-called hard problem of consciousness, often delegated to the realm of philosophy, including neurophilosophy (or in some cases to religion and similar approaches).

===In art===
Of the thematic representations of sleep in art, physician and sleep researcher Meir Kryger wrote, &quot;[Artists] have intense fascination with mythology, dreams, religious themes, the parallel between sleep and death, reward, abandonment of conscious control, healing, a depiction of innocence and serenity, and the erotic.&quot;

<text>Superoxide dismutase (SOD, ) is an enzyme that alternately catalyzes the dismutation (or partitioning) of the superoxide () anion radical into normal molecular oxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (). Superoxide is produced as a by-product of oxygen metabolism and, if not regulated, causes many types of cell damage. Hydrogen peroxide is also damaging and is degraded by other enzymes such as catalase. Thus, SOD is an important antioxidant defense in nearly all living cells exposed to oxygen. One exception is &quot;Lactobacillus plantarum&quot; and related lactobacilli, which use intracellular manganese to prevent damage from reactive .

== Chemical reaction ==
SODs catalyze the disproportionation of superoxide:
In this way, is converted into two less damaging species.

The general form, applicable to all the different metal−coordinated forms of SOD, can be written as follows:
* + + → + 

The reactions by which SOD−catalyzed dismutation of superoxide for Cu,Zn SOD can be written as follows:
* + → + (reduction of copper; oxidation of superoxide)
* + + → + (oxidation of copper; reduction of superoxide)

where M = Cu (n=1); Mn (n=2); Fe (n=2); Ni (n=2) only in prokaryotes.

In a series of such reactions, the oxidation state and the charge of the metal cation oscillates between n and n+1: +1 and +2 for Cu, or +2 and +3 for the other metals .

== Types ==

=== General ===

Irwin Fridovich and Joe McCord at Duke University discovered the enzymatic activity of superoxide dismutase in 1968. SODs were previously known as a group of metalloproteins with unknown function; for example, CuZnSOD was known as erythrocuprein (or hemocuprein, or cytocuprein) or as the veterinary anti-inflammatory drug &quot;Orgotein&quot;. Likewise, Brewer (1967) identified a protein that later became known as superoxide dismutase as an indophenol oxidase by protein analysis of starch gels using the phenazine-tetrazolium technique.

There are three major families of superoxide dismutase, depending on the protein fold and the metal cofactor: the Cu/Zn type (which binds both copper and zinc), Fe and Mn types (which bind either iron or manganese), and the Ni type (which binds nickel).
* Copper and zinc – most commonly used by eukaryotes, including humans. The cytosols of virtually all eukaryotic cells contain a SOD enzyme with copper and zinc (Cu-Zn-SOD). For example, Cu-Zn-SOD available commercially is normally purified from bovine red blood cells. The bovine Cu-Zn enzyme is a homodimer of molecular weight 32,500. It was the first SOD whose atomic-detail crystal structure was solved, in 1975. It is an 8-stranded &quot;Greek key&quot; beta-barrel, with the active site held between the barrel and two surface loops. The two subunits are tightly joined back-to-back, mostly by hydrophobic and some electrostatic interactions. The ligands of the copper and zinc are six histidine and one aspartate side-chains; one histidine is bound between the two metals. 
*Iron or manganese – used by prokaryotes and protists, and in mitochondria and chloroplasts
** Iron – Many bacteria contain a form of the enzyme with iron (Fe-SOD); some bacteria contain Fe-SOD, others Mn-SOD, and some (such as &quot;E. coli&quot;) contain both. Fe-SOD can also be found in the chloroplasts of plants. The 3D structures of the homologous Mn and Fe superoxide dismutases have the same arrangement of alpha-helices, and their active sites contain the same type and arrangement of amino acid side-chains. They are usually dimers, but occasionally tetramers.
** Manganese – Nearly all mitochondria, and many bacteria, contain a form with manganese (Mn-SOD): For example, the Mn-SOD found in human mitochondria. The ligands of the manganese ions are 3 histidine side-chains, an aspartate side-chain and a water molecule or hydroxy ligand, depending on the Mn oxidation state (respectively II and III).
* Nickel – prokaryotic. This has a hexameric (6-copy) structure built from right-handed 4-helix bundles, each containing N-terminal hooks that chelate a Ni ion. The Ni-hook contains the motif His-Cys-X-X-Pro-Cys-Gly-X-Tyr; it provides most of the interactions critical for metal binding and catalysis and is, therefore, a likely diagnostic of NiSODs.

In higher plants, SOD isozymes have been localized in different cell compartments. Mn-SOD is present in mitochondria and peroxisomes. Fe-SOD has been found mainly in chloroplasts but has also been detected in peroxisomes, and CuZn-SOD has been localized in cytosol, chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and apoplast.

=== Human ===

There are three forms of superoxide dismutase present in humans, in all other mammals, and most chordates. SOD1 is located in the cytoplasm, SOD2 in the mitochondria, and SOD3 is extracellular. The first is a dimer (consists of two units), whereas the others are tetramers (four subunits). SOD1 and SOD3 contain copper and zinc, whereas SOD2, the mitochondrial enzyme, has manganese in its reactive centre. The genes are located on chromosomes 21, 6, and 4, respectively (21q22.1, 6q25.3 and 4p15.3-p15.1).
=== Plants ===

In higher plants, superoxide dismutase enzymes (SODs) act as antioxidants and protect cellular components from being oxidized by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can form as a result of drought, injury, herbicides and pesticides, ozone, plant metabolic activity, nutrient deficiencies, photoinhibition, temperature above and below ground, toxic metals, and UV or gamma rays. To be specific, molecular O2 is reduced to (a ROS called superoxide) when it absorbs an excited electron released from compounds of the electron transport chain. Superoxide is known to denature enzymes, oxidize lipids, and fragment DNA. SODs catalyze the production of O2 and from superoxide (), which results in less harmful reactants.

When acclimating to increased levels of oxidative stress, SOD concentrations typically increase with the degree of stress conditions. The compartmentalization of different forms of SOD throughout the plant makes them counteract stress very effectively. There are three well-known and -studied classes of SOD metallic coenzymes that exist in plants. First, Fe SODs consist of two species, one homodimer (containing 1–2 g Fe) and one tetramer (containing 2–4 g Fe). They are thought to be the most ancient SOD metalloenzymes and are found within both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Fe SODs are most abundantly localized inside plant chloroplasts, where they are indigenous. Second, Mn SODs consist of a homodimer and homotetramer species each containing a single Mn(III) atom per subunit. They are found predominantly in mitochondrion and peroxisomes. Third, Cu-Zn SODs have electrical properties very different from those of the other two classes. These are concentrated in the chloroplast, cytosol, and in some cases the extracellular space. Note that Cu-Zn SODs provide less protection than Fe SODs when localized in the chloroplast.

=== Bacteria ===

Human white blood cells use enzymes such as NADPH oxidase to generate superoxide and other reactive oxygen species to kill bacteria. During infection, some bacteria (e.g., &quot;Burkholderia pseudomallei&quot;) therefore produce superoxide dismutase to protect themselves from being killed.

== Biochemistry ==

SOD out-competes damaging reactions of superoxide, thus protecting the cell from superoxide toxicity.
The reaction of superoxide with non-radicals is spin-forbidden. In biological systems, this means that its main reactions are with itself (dismutation) or with another biological radical such as nitric oxide (NO) or with a transition-series metal. The superoxide anion radical () spontaneously dismutes to O2 and hydrogen peroxide () quite rapidly (~105 M−1s−1 at pH 7). SOD is necessary because superoxide reacts with sensitive and critical cellular targets. For example, it reacts with the NO radical, and makes toxic peroxynitrite.

Because the uncatalysed dismutation reaction for superoxide requires two superoxide molecules to react with each other, the dismutation rate is second-order with respect to initial superoxide concentration. Thus, the half-life of superoxide, although very short at high concentrations (e.g., 0.05 seconds at 0.1mM) is actually quite long at low concentrations (e.g., 14 hours at 0.1 nM). In contrast, the reaction of superoxide with SOD is first order with respect to superoxide concentration. Moreover, superoxide dismutase has the largest &quot;k&quot;cat/&quot;K&quot;M (an approximation of catalytic efficiency) of any known enzyme (~7 x 109 M−1s−1), this reaction being limited only by the frequency of collision between itself and superoxide. That is, the reaction rate is &quot;diffusion-limited&quot;.

The high efficiency of superoxide dismutase seems necessary: even at the subnanomolar concentrations achieved by the high concentrations of SOD within cells, superoxide inactivates the citric acid cycle enzyme aconitase, can poison energy metabolism, and releases potentially toxic iron. Aconitase is one of several iron-sulfur-containing (de)hydratases in metabolic pathways shown to be inactivated by superoxide.

== Stability and folding mechanism ==

SOD1 is an extremely stable protein. In the holo form (both copper and zinc bound) the melting point is &gt; 90 °C. In the apo form (no copper or zinc bound) the melting point is ~60 °C. By differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), holo SOD1 unfolds by a two-state mechanism: from dimer to two unfolded monomers. In chemical denaturation experiments, holo SOD1 unfolds by a three-state mechanism with observation of a folded monomeric intermediate.

== Physiology ==

Superoxide is one of the main reactive oxygen species in the cell. As a consequence, SOD serves a key antioxidant role. The physiological importance of SODs is illustrated by the severe pathologies evident in mice genetically engineered to lack these enzymes. Mice lacking SOD2 die several days after birth, amid massive oxidative stress. Mice lacking SOD1 develop a wide range of pathologies, including hepatocellular carcinoma, an acceleration of age-related muscle mass loss, an earlier incidence of cataracts, and a reduced lifespan. Mice lacking SOD3 do not show any obvious defects and exhibit a normal lifespan, though they are more sensitive to hyperoxic injury. Knockout mice of any SOD enzyme are more sensitive to the lethal effects of superoxide-generating compounds, such as paraquat and diquat (herbicides).

&quot;Drosophila&quot; lacking SOD1 have a dramatically shortened lifespan, whereas flies lacking SOD2 die before birth. Depletion of SOD1 and SOD2 in the nervous system and muscles of &quot;Drosophila&quot; is associated with reduced lifespan. The accumulation of neuronal and muscular ROS appears to contribute to age-associated impairments. When overexpression of mitochondrial SOD2 is induced, the lifespan of adult &quot;Drosophila&quot; is extended.

Among black garden ants (&quot;Lasius niger&quot;), the lifespan of queens is an order of magnitude greater than of workers despite no systematic nucleotide sequence difference between them. The &quot;SOD3&quot; gene was found to be the most differentially over-expressed in the brains of queen vs worker ants. This finding raises the possibility of an important role of antioxidant function in modulating lifespan.

SOD knockdowns in the worm &quot;C. elegans&quot; do not cause major physiological disruptions. However, the lifespan of &quot;C. elegans&quot; can be extended by superoxide/catalase mimetics suggesting that oxidative stress is a major determinant of the rate of aging.

Knockout or null mutations in SOD1 are highly detrimental to aerobic growth in the budding yeast &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; and result in a dramatic reduction in post-diauxic lifespan. In wild-type &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;, DNA damage rates increased 3-fold with age, but more than 5-fold in mutants deleted for either the &quot;SOD1&quot; or &quot;SOD2&quot; genes. Reactive oxygen species levels increase with age in these mutant strains and show a similar pattern to the pattern of DNA damage increase with age. Thus it appears that superoxide dismutase plays a substantial role in preserving genome integrity during aging in &quot;S. cerevisiae&quot;.
SOD2 knockout or null mutations cause growth inhibition on respiratory carbon sources in addition to decreased post-diauxic lifespan.

In the fission yeast &quot;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&quot;, deficiency of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase SOD2 accelerates chronological aging.

Several prokaryotic SOD null mutants have been generated, including &quot;E. coli&quot;. The loss of periplasmic CuZnSOD causes loss of virulence and might be an attractive target for new antibiotics.

== Role in disease ==

Mutations in the first SOD enzyme (SOD1) can cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, a form of motor neuron disease). The most common mutation in the U.S. is A4V, while the most intensely studied is G93A. Inactivation of SOD1 causes hepatocellular carcinoma. Diminished SOD3 activity has been linked to lung diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Superoxide dismutase is not expressed in neural crest cells in the developing fetus. Hence, high levels of free radicals can cause damage to them and induce dysraphic anomalies (neural tube defects).

Mutations in SOD1 can cause familial ALS (several pieces of evidence also show that wild-type SOD1, under conditions of cellular stress, is implicated in a significant fraction of sporadic ALS cases, which represent 90% of ALS patients.), by a mechanism that is presently not understood, but not due to loss of enzymatic activity or a decrease in the conformational stability of the SOD1 protein. Overexpression of SOD1 has been linked to the neural disorders seen in Down syndrome. In patients with thalassemia, SOD will increase as a form of compensation mechanism. However, in the chronic stage, SOD does not seem to be sufficient and tends to decrease due to the destruction of proteins from the massive reaction of oxidant-antioxidant.

In mice, the extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3, ecSOD) contributes to the development of hypertension. Inactivation of SOD2 in mice causes perinatal lethality.

== Medical uses ==

Supplementary superoxide dimutase has been suggested as a treatment to prevent bronchopulmonary dysplasia in infants who are born preterm, however the effectiveness of his treatment is not clear.

== Research ==
SOD has been used in experimental treatment of chronic inflammation in inflammatory bowel conditions. SOD may ameliorate cis-platinum-induced nephrotoxicity (rodent studies). As &quot;Orgotein&quot; or &quot;ontosein&quot;, a pharmacologically-active purified bovine liver SOD, it is also effective in the treatment of urinary tract inflammatory disease in man. For a time, bovine liver SOD even had regulatory approval in several European countries for such use. This was cut short by concerns about prion disease.

An SOD-mimetic agent, TEMPOL, is currently in clinical trials for radioprotection and to prevent radiation-induced dermatitis. TEMPOL and similar SOD-mimetic nitroxides exhibit a multiplicity of actions in diseases involving oxidative stress.

The synthesis of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, L-ascorbate oxidase, and Delta 1 DNA polymerase is initiated in plants with the activation of genes associated with stress conditions for plants. The most common stress conditions can be injury, drought or soil salinity. Limiting this process initiated by the conditions of strong soil salinity can be achieved by administering exogenous glutamine to plants. The decrease in the level of expression of genes responsible for the synthesis of superoxide dismutase increases with the increase in glutamine concentration.

== Cosmetic uses ==

SOD may reduce free radical damage to skin—for example, to reduce fibrosis following radiation for breast cancer. Studies of this kind must be regarded as tentative, however, as there were not adequate controls in the study including a lack of randomization, double-blinding, or placebo. Superoxide dismutase is known to reverse fibrosis, possibly through de-differentiation of myofibroblasts back to fibroblasts.

== Commercial sources ==

SOD is commercially obtained from marine phytoplankton, bovine liver, horseradish, cantaloupe, and certain bacteria. For therapeutic purpose, SOD is usually injected locally. There is no evidence that ingestion of unprotected SOD or SOD-rich foods can have any physiological effects, as all ingested SOD is broken down into amino acids before being absorbed. However, ingestion of SOD bound to wheat proteins could improve its therapeutic activity, at least in theory.

<text>In mathematics, a sequence is an enumerated collection of objects in which repetitions are allowed and order matters. Like a set, it contains members (also called &quot;elements&quot;, or &quot;terms&quot;). The number of elements (possibly infinite) is called the &quot;length&quot; of the sequence. Unlike a set, the same elements can appear multiple times at different positions in a sequence, and unlike a set, the order does matter. Formally, a sequence can be defined as a function from natural numbers (the positions of elements in the sequence) to the elements at each position. The notion of a sequence can be generalized to an indexed family, defined as a function from an &quot;arbitrary&quot; index set.

For example, (M, A, R, Y) is a sequence of letters with the letter &quot;M&quot; first and &quot;Y&quot; last. This sequence differs from (A, R, M, Y). Also, the sequence (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8), which contains the number 1 at two different positions, is a valid sequence. Sequences can be &quot;finite&quot;, as in these examples, or &quot;infinite&quot;, such as the sequence of all even positive integers (2, 4, 6, ...).

The position of an element in a sequence is its &quot;rank&quot; or &quot;index&quot;; it is the natural number for which the element is the image. The first element has index 0 or 1, depending on the context or a specific convention. In mathematical analysis, a sequence is often denoted by letters in the form of formula_1, formula_2 and formula_3, where the subscript &quot;n&quot; refers to the &quot;n&quot;th element of the sequence; for example, the &quot;n&quot;th element of the Fibonacci sequence &quot;formula_4&quot; is generally denoted as &quot;formula_5&quot;.

In computing and computer science, finite sequences are usually called &quot;strings&quot;, &quot;words&quot; or &quot;lists,&quot; with the specific technical term chosen depending on the type of object the sequence enumerates and the different ways to represent the sequence in computer memory. Infinite sequences are called &quot;streams&quot;.

The empty sequence ( ) is included in most notions of sequence. It may be excluded depending on the context.

==Examples and notation==
A sequence can be thought of as a list of elements with a particular order. Sequences are useful in a number of mathematical disciplines for studying functions, spaces, and other mathematical structures using the convergence properties of sequences. In particular, sequences are the basis for series, which are important in differential equations and analysis. Sequences are also of interest in their own right, and can be studied as patterns or puzzles, such as in the study of prime numbers.

There are a number of ways to denote a sequence, some of which are more useful for specific types of sequences. One way to specify a sequence is to list all its elements. For example, the first four odd numbers form the sequence (1, 3, 5, 7). This notation is used for infinite sequences as well. For instance, the infinite sequence of positive odd integers is written as (1, 3, 5, 7, ...). Because notating sequences with ellipsis leads to ambiguity, listing is most useful for customary infinite sequences which can be easily recognized from their first few elements. Other ways of denoting a sequence are discussed after the examples.

===Examples===
The prime numbers are the natural numbers greater than 1 that have no divisors but 1 and themselves. Taking these in their natural order gives the sequence (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...). The prime numbers are widely used in mathematics, particularly in number theory where many results related to them exist.

The Fibonacci numbers comprise the integer sequence in which each element is the sum of the previous two elements. The first two elements are either 0 and 1 or 1 and 1 so that the sequence is (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...).

Other examples of sequences include those made up of rational numbers, real numbers and complex numbers. The sequence (.9, .99, .999, .9999, ...), for instance, approaches the number 1. In fact, every real number can be written as the limit of a sequence of rational numbers (e.g. via its decimal expansion, also see &quot;completeness of the real numbers&quot;). As another example,  is the limit of the sequence (3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, ...), which is increasing. A related sequence is the sequence of decimal digits of , that is, (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, ...). Unlike the preceding sequence, this sequence does not have any pattern that is easily discernible by inspection.

Other examples are sequences of functions, whose elements are functions instead of numbers.

The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences comprises a large list of examples of integer sequences.

===Indexing===
Other notations can be useful for sequences whose pattern cannot be easily guessed or for sequences that do not have a pattern such as the digits of . One such notation is to write down a general formula for computing the &quot;n&quot;th term as a function of &quot;n&quot;, enclose it in parentheses, and include a subscript indicating the set of values that &quot;n&quot; can take. For example, in this notation the sequence of even numbers could be written as formula_6. The sequence of squares could be written as formula_7. The variable &quot;n&quot; is called an index, and the set of values that it can take is called the index set.

It is often useful to combine this notation with the technique of treating the elements of a sequence as individual variables. This yields expressions like formula_8, which denotes a sequence whose &quot;n&quot;th element is given by the variable formula_1. For example:
:formula_10
One can consider multiple sequences at the same time by using different variables; e.g. formula_11 could be a different sequence than formula_8. One can even consider a sequence of sequences: formula_13 denotes a sequence whose &quot;m&quot;th term is the sequence formula_14.

An alternative to writing the domain of a sequence in the subscript is to indicate the range of values that the index can take by listing its highest and lowest legal values. For example, the notation formula_15 denotes the ten-term sequence of squares formula_16. The limits formula_17 and formula_18 are allowed, but they do not represent valid values for the index, only the supremum or infimum of such values, respectively. For example, the sequence formula_19 is the same as the sequence formula_8, and does not contain an additional term &quot;at infinity&quot;. The sequence formula_21 is a bi-infinite sequence, and can also be written as formula_22.

In cases where the set of indexing numbers is understood, the subscripts and superscripts are often left off. That is, one simply writes formula_23 for an arbitrary sequence. Often, the index &quot;k&quot; is understood to run from 1 to ∞. However, sequences are frequently indexed starting from zero, as in
:formula_24
In some cases, the elements of the sequence are related naturally to a sequence of integers whose pattern can be easily inferred. In these cases, the index set may be implied by a listing of the first few abstract elements. For instance, the sequence of squares of odd numbers could be denoted in any of the following ways.

* formula_25
* formula_26
* formula_27
* formula_28
* formula_29

Moreover, the subscripts and superscripts could have been left off in the third, fourth, and fifth notations, if the indexing set was understood to be the natural numbers. In the second and third bullets, there is a well-defined sequence formula_30, but it is not the same as the sequence denoted by the expression.

===Defining a sequence by recursion===

Sequences whose elements are related to the previous elements in a straightforward way are often defined using recursion. This is in contrast to the definition of sequences of elements as functions of their positions.

To define a sequence by recursion, one needs a rule, called &quot;recurrence relation&quot; to construct each element in terms of the ones before it. In addition, enough initial elements must be provided so that all subsequent elements of the sequence can be computed by successive applications of the recurrence relation.

The Fibonacci sequence is a simple classical example, defined by the recurrence relation
:formula_31
with initial terms formula_32 and formula_33. From this, a simple computation shows that the first ten terms of this sequence are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.

A complicated example of a sequence defined by a recurrence relation is Recamán&#x27;s sequence, defined by the recurrence relation
:formula_34
with initial term formula_35

A &quot;linear recurrence with constant coefficients&quot; is a recurrence relation of the form
:formula_36
where formula_37 are constants. There is a general method for expressing the general term formula_1 of such a sequence as a function of ; see Linear recurrence. In the case of the Fibonacci sequence, one has formula_39 and the resulting function of is given by Binet&#x27;s formula.

A holonomic sequence is a sequence defined by a recurrence relation of the form 
:formula_40
where formula_41 are polynomials in . For most holonomic sequences, there is no explicit formula for expressing formula_1 as a function of . Nevertheless, holonomic sequences play an important role in various areas of mathematics. For example, many special functions have a Taylor series whose sequence of coefficients is holonomic. The use of the recurrence relation allows a fast computation of values of such special functions.

Not all sequences can be specified by a recurrence relation. An example is the sequence of prime numbers in their natural order (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...).

==Formal definition and basic properties==
There are many different notions of sequences in mathematics, some of which (&quot;e.g.&quot;, exact sequence) are not covered by the definitions and notations introduced below.

===Definition===
In this article, a sequence is formally defined as a function whose domain is an interval of integers. This definition covers several different uses of the word &quot;sequence&quot;, including one-sided infinite sequences, bi-infinite sequences, and finite sequences (see below for definitions of these kinds of sequences). However, many authors use a narrower definition by requiring the domain of a sequence to be the set of natural numbers. This narrower definition has the disadvantage that it rules out finite sequences and bi-infinite sequences, both of which are usually called sequences in standard mathematical practice. Another disadvantage is that, if one removes the first terms of a sequence, one needs reindexing the remainder terms for fitting this definition. In some contexts, to shorten exposition, the codomain of the sequence is fixed by context, for example by requiring it to be the set R of real numbers, the set C of complex numbers, or a topological space.

Although sequences are a type of function, they are usually distinguished notationally from functions in that the input is written as a subscript rather than in parentheses, that is, rather than . There are terminological differences as well: the value of a sequence at the lowest input (often 1) is called the &quot;first element&quot; of the sequence, the value at the second smallest input (often 2) is called the &quot;second element&quot;, etc. Also, while a function abstracted from its input is usually denoted by a single letter, e.g. &quot;f&quot;, a sequence abstracted from its input is usually written by a notation such as formula_43, or just as formula_44 Here is the domain, or index set, of the sequence.

Sequences and their limits (see below) are important concepts for studying topological spaces. An important generalization of sequences is the concept of nets. A net is a function from a (possibly uncountable) directed set to a topological space. The notational conventions for sequences normally apply to nets as well.

===Finite and infinite===

The length of a sequence is defined as the number of terms in the sequence.

A sequence of a finite length &quot;n&quot; is also called an &quot;n&quot;-tuple. Finite sequences include the empty sequence ( ) that has no elements.
Normally, the term &quot;infinite sequence&quot; refers to a sequence that is infinite in one direction, and finite in the other—the sequence has a first element, but no final element. Such a sequence is called a singly infinite sequence or a one-sided infinite sequence when disambiguation is necessary. In contrast, a sequence that is infinite in both directions—i.e. that has neither a first nor a final element—is called a bi-infinite sequence, two-way infinite sequence, or doubly infinite sequence. A function from the set Z of &quot;all&quot; integers into a set, such as for instance the sequence of all even integers ( ..., −4, −2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, ... ), is bi-infinite. This sequence could be denoted formula_45.

===Increasing and decreasing===
A sequence is said to be &quot;monotonically increasing&quot; if each term is greater than or equal to the one before it. For example, the sequence formula_46 is monotonically increasing if and only if formula_47 for all formula_48 If each consecutive term is strictly greater than (&gt;) the previous term then the sequence is called strictly monotonically increasing. A sequence is monotonically decreasing if each consecutive term is less than or equal to the previous one, and is strictly monotonically decreasing if each is strictly less than the previous. If a sequence is either increasing or decreasing it is called a monotone sequence. This is a special case of the more general notion of a monotonic function.

The terms nondecreasing and nonincreasing are often used in place of &quot;increasing&quot; and &quot;decreasing&quot; in order to avoid any possible confusion with &quot;strictly increasing&quot; and &quot;strictly decreasing&quot;, respectively.

===Bounded===
If the sequence of real numbers (&quot;an&quot;) is such that all the terms are less than some real number &quot;M&quot;, then the sequence is said to be bounded from above. In other words, this means that there exists &quot;M&quot; such that for all &quot;n&quot;, &quot;an&quot; ≤ &quot;M&quot;. Any such &quot;M&quot; is called an &quot;upper bound&quot;. Likewise, if, for some real &quot;m&quot;, &quot;an&quot; ≥ &quot;m&quot; for all &quot;n&quot; greater than some &quot;N&quot;, then the sequence is bounded from below and any such &quot;m&quot; is called a &quot;lower bound&quot;. If a sequence is both bounded from above and bounded from below, then the sequence is said to be bounded.

===Subsequences===
A subsequence of a given sequence is a sequence formed from the given sequence by deleting some of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements. For instance, the sequence of positive even integers (2, 4, 6, ...) is a subsequence of the positive integers (1, 2, 3, ...). The positions of some elements change when other elements are deleted. However, the relative positions are preserved.

Formally, a subsequence of the sequence formula_49 is any sequence of the form formula_50, where formula_51 is a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers.

===Other types of sequences===
Some other types of sequences that are easy to define include:
* An integer sequence is a sequence whose terms are integers.
* A polynomial sequence is a sequence whose terms are polynomials.
* A positive integer sequence is sometimes called multiplicative, if &quot;a&quot;&quot;nm&quot; = &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; &quot;a&quot;&quot;m&quot; for all pairs &quot;n&quot;, &quot;m&quot; such that &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot; are coprime. In other instances, sequences are often called &quot;multiplicative&quot;, if &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;na&quot;1 for all &quot;n&quot;. Moreover, a &quot;multiplicative&quot; Fibonacci sequence satisfies the recursion relation &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot; = &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;−1 &quot;a&quot;&quot;n&quot;−2.
* A binary sequence is a sequence whose terms have one of two discrete values, e.g. base 2 values (0,1,1,0, ...), a series of coin tosses (Heads/Tails) H,T,H,H,T, ..., the answers to a set of True or False questions (T, F, T, T, ...), and so on.

==Limits and convergence==


An important property of a sequence is &quot;convergence&quot;. If a sequence converges, it converges to a particular value known as the &quot;limit&quot;. If a sequence converges to some limit, then it is convergent. A sequence that does not converge is divergent.

Informally, a sequence has a limit if the elements of the sequence become closer and closer to some value formula_52 (called the limit of the sequence), and they become and remain &quot;arbitrarily&quot; close to formula_52, meaning that given a real number formula_54 greater than zero, all but a finite number of the elements of the sequence have a distance from formula_52 less than formula_54.

For example, the sequence formula_57 shown to the right converges to the value 0. On the other hand, the sequences formula_58 (which begins 1, 8, 27, ...) and formula_59 (which begins −1, 1, −1, 1, ...) are both divergent.

If a sequence converges, then the value it converges to is unique. This value is called the limit of the sequence. The limit of a convergent sequence formula_60 is normally denoted formula_61. If formula_60 is a divergent sequence, then the expression formula_61 is meaningless.

=== Formal definition of convergence===

A sequence of real numbers formula_60 converges to a real number formula_52 if, for all formula_66, there exists a natural number formula_67 such that for all formula_68 we have 
:formula_69

If formula_60 is a sequence of complex numbers rather than a sequence of real numbers, this last formula can still be used to define convergence, with the provision that formula_71 denotes the complex modulus, i.e. formula_72. If formula_60 is a sequence of points in a metric space, then the formula can be used to define convergence, if the expression formula_74 is replaced by the expression formula_75, which denotes the distance between formula_1 and formula_52.

===Applications and important results===
If formula_60 and formula_79 are convergent sequences, then the following limits exist, and can be computed as follows:

* formula_80
* formula_81 for all real numbers formula_82
* formula_83
* formula_84, provided that formula_85
* formula_86 for all formula_87 and formula_88

Moreover:
* If formula_89 for all formula_90 greater than some formula_67, then formula_92.
* (Squeeze Theorem)&lt;br&gt;If formula_93 is a sequence such that formula_94 for all formula_95 &lt;br&gt;then formula_93 is convergent, and formula_97.
* If a sequence is bounded and monotonic then it is convergent.
* A sequence is convergent if and only if all of its subsequences are convergent.

===Cauchy sequences===


A Cauchy sequence is a sequence whose terms become arbitrarily close together as n gets very large. The notion of a Cauchy sequence is important in the study of sequences in metric spaces, and, in particular, in real analysis. One particularly important result in real analysis is &quot;Cauchy characterization of convergence for sequences&quot;:
:A sequence of real numbers is convergent (in the reals) if and only if it is Cauchy.
In contrast, there are Cauchy sequences of rational numbers that are not convergent in the rationals, e.g. the sequence defined by formula_98 and formula_99 is Cauchy, but has no rational limit (cf. ). More generally, any sequence of rational numbers that converges to an irrational number is Cauchy, but not convergent when interpreted as a sequence in the set of rational numbers.

Metric spaces that satisfy the Cauchy characterization of convergence for sequences are called complete metric spaces and are particularly nice for analysis.

=== Infinite limits ===

In calculus, it is common to define notation for sequences which do not converge in the sense discussed above, but which instead become and remain arbitrarily large, or become and remain arbitrarily negative. If formula_1 becomes arbitrarily large as formula_101, we write
:formula_102
In this case we say that the sequence diverges, or that it converges to infinity. An example of such a sequence is .

If formula_1 becomes arbitrarily negative (i.e. negative and large in magnitude) as formula_101, we write
:formula_105
and say that the sequence diverges or converges to negative infinity.

==Series==

A series is, informally speaking, the sum of the terms of a sequence. That is, it is an expression of the form formula_106 or formula_107, where formula_60 is a sequence of real or complex numbers. The partial sums of a series are the expressions resulting from replacing the infinity symbol with a finite number, i.e. the &quot;N&quot;th partial sum of the series formula_106 is the number
:formula_110
The partial sums themselves form a sequence formula_111, which is called the sequence of partial sums of the series formula_106. If the sequence of partial sums converges, then we say that the series formula_106 is convergent, and the limit formula_114 is called the value of the series. The same notation is used to denote a series and its value, i.e. we write formula_115.

===Topology===
Sequences play an important role in topology, especially in the study of metric spaces. For instance:
* A metric space is compact exactly when it is sequentially compact.
* A function from a metric space to another metric space is continuous exactly when it takes convergent sequences to convergent sequences.
* A metric space is a connected space if and only if, whenever the space is partitioned into two sets, one of the two sets contains a sequence converging to a point in the other set.
* A topological space is separable exactly when there is a dense sequence of points.

Sequences can be generalized to nets or filters. These generalizations allow one to extend some of the above theorems to spaces without metrics.

====Product topology====
The topological product of a sequence of topological spaces is the cartesian product of those spaces, equipped with a natural topology called the product topology.

More formally, given a sequence of spaces formula_116, the product space

:formula_117

is defined as the set of all sequences formula_118 such that for each &quot;i&quot;, formula_119 is an element of formula_120. The canonical projections are the maps &quot;pi&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Xi&quot; defined by the equation formula_121. Then the product topology on &quot;X&quot; is defined to be the coarsest topology (i.e. the topology with the fewest open sets) for which all the projections &quot;pi&quot; are continuous. The product topology is sometimes called the Tychonoff topology.

===Analysis===
When discussing sequences in analysis, one will generally consider sequences of the form
:formula_122
which is to say, infinite sequences of elements indexed by natural numbers.

A sequence may start with an index different from 1 or 0. For example, the sequence defined by &quot;xn&quot; = 1/log(&quot;n&quot;) would be defined only for &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2. When talking about such infinite sequences, it is usually sufficient (and does not change much for most considerations) to assume that the members of the sequence are defined at least for all indices large enough, that is, greater than some given &quot;N&quot;.

The most elementary type of sequences are numerical ones, that is, sequences of real or complex numbers. This type can be generalized to sequences of elements of some vector space. In analysis, the vector spaces considered are often function spaces. Even more generally, one can study sequences with elements in some topological space.

====Sequence spaces====

A sequence space is a vector space whose elements are infinite sequences of real or complex numbers. Equivalently, it is a function space whose elements are functions from the natural numbers to the field &quot;K&quot;, where &quot;K&quot; is either the field of real numbers or the field of complex numbers. The set of all such functions is naturally identified with the set of all possible infinite sequences with elements in &quot;K&quot;, and can be turned into a vector space under the operations of pointwise addition of functions and pointwise scalar multiplication. All sequence spaces are linear subspaces of this space. Sequence spaces are typically equipped with a norm, or at least the structure of a topological vector space.

The most important sequences spaces in analysis are the ℓ&quot;p&quot; spaces, consisting of the &quot;p&quot;-power summable sequences, with the &quot;p&quot;-norm. These are special cases of L&quot;p&quot; spaces for the counting measure on the set of natural numbers. Other important classes of sequences like convergent sequences or null sequences form sequence spaces, respectively denoted &quot;c&quot; and &quot;c&quot;0, with the sup norm. Any sequence space can also be equipped with the topology of pointwise convergence, under which it becomes a special kind of Fréchet space called an FK-space.

===Linear algebra===
Sequences over a field may also be viewed as vectors in a vector space. Specifically, the set of &quot;F&quot;-valued sequences (where &quot;F&quot; is a field) is a function space (in fact, a product space) of &quot;F&quot;-valued functions over the set of natural numbers.

===Abstract algebra===
Abstract algebra employs several types of sequences, including sequences of mathematical objects such as groups or rings.

====Free monoid====

If &quot;A&quot; is a set, the free monoid over &quot;A&quot; (denoted &quot;A&quot;*, also called Kleene star of &quot;A&quot;) is a monoid containing all the finite sequences (or strings) of zero or more elements of &quot;A&quot;, with the binary operation of concatenation. The free semigroup &quot;A&quot;+ is the subsemigroup of &quot;A&quot;* containing all elements except the empty sequence.

====Exact sequences====

In the context of group theory, a sequence
:formula_123
of groups and group homomorphisms is called exact, if the image (or range) of each homomorphism is equal to the kernel of the next:
:formula_124

The sequence of groups and homomorphisms may be either finite or infinite.

A similar definition can be made for certain other algebraic structures. For example, one could have an exact sequence of vector spaces and linear maps, or of modules and module homomorphisms.

====Spectral sequences====

In homological algebra and algebraic topology, a spectral sequence is a means of computing homology groups by taking successive approximations. Spectral sequences are a generalization of exact sequences, and since their introduction by , they have become an important research tool, particularly in homotopy theory.

===Set theory===
An ordinal-indexed sequence is a generalization of a sequence. If α is a limit ordinal and &quot;X&quot; is a set, an α-indexed sequence of elements of &quot;X&quot; is a function from α to &quot;X&quot;. In this terminology an ω-indexed sequence is an ordinary sequence.

===Computing===
In computer science, finite sequences are called lists. Potentially infinite sequences are called streams. Finite sequences of characters or digits are called strings.

===Streams===
Infinite sequences of digits (or characters) drawn from a finite alphabet are of particular interest in theoretical computer science. They are often referred to simply as &quot;sequences&quot; or &quot;streams&quot;, as opposed to finite &quot;strings&quot;. Infinite binary sequences, for instance, are infinite sequences of bits (characters drawn from the alphabet {0, 1}). The set &quot;C&quot; = {0, 1}∞ of all infinite binary sequences is sometimes called the Cantor space.

An infinite binary sequence can represent a formal language (a set of strings) by setting the &quot;n&quot; th bit of the sequence to 1 if and only if the &quot;n&quot; th string (in shortlex order) is in the language. This representation is useful in the diagonalization method for proofs.

<doc id="27840" wikidata="Q1321402" url="?curid=27840" title="Senryū">
<text>is a Japanese form of short poetry similar to haiku in construction: three lines with 17 (or , often translated as syllables, but see the article on for distinctions). tend to be about human foibles while haiku tend to be about nature, and are often cynical or darkly humorous while haiku are more serious.

Like haiku, senryū originated as an opening part (hokku) of a larger Japanese poem called renga. Unlike haiku, do not include a (cutting word), and do not generally include a , or season word.

==Form and content==
 is named after Edo period poet , whose collection launched the genre into the public consciousness. A typical example from the collection:

This , which can also be translated &quot;Catching him / I see the robber / is my son,&quot; is not so much a personal experience of the author as an example of a type of situation (provided by a short comment called a or fore-verse, which usually prefaces a number of examples) and/or a brief or witty rendition of an incident from history or the arts (plays, songs, tales, poetry, etc.).

==Senryū in the United States==
The first senryū circle in the United States was reportedly started by Japanese immigrants in Yakima, Washington, during the early 1900s. Over time, other senryū circles were established in Seattle and other Japanese communities in the Pacific Northwest. In 1938, the Los Angeles–based Kashu Mainichi Shimbun published its first senryū section. 

During the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II, senryū was a popular activity in the camps.

===English-language publications===
In the 1970s, Michael McClintock edited &quot;Seer Ox: American Senryu Magazine&quot;. In 1993, Michael Dylan Welch edited and published &quot;Fig Newtons:&quot; &quot;to Go&quot;, the first anthology of English-language .
*&quot;Prune Juice&quot;, a journal of and , is edited by Aaron Barry, Antoinette Cheung, and P. H. Fischer.
*&quot;Failed Haiku&quot; is edited by Bryan Rickert and Hemapriya Chellappan.
*&quot;Simply Haiku&quot; archives (final publication in 2009) contain a regular column edited by Alan Pizzarelli.

Additionally, one can regularly find and related articles in some haiku publications. For example, the &quot;World Haiku Review&quot; has regularly published . regularly appear or appeared in the pages of &quot;Modern Haiku&quot;, &quot;Frogpond&quot;, &quot;Bottle Rockets&quot;, &quot;Woodnotes&quot;, &quot;Tundra&quot;, &quot;Haiku Canada Review&quot;, &quot;Presence&quot;, &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, &quot;Kingfisher&quot;, and other haiku journals, often unsegregated from haiku.

<text>Sorious Samura (born 27 October 1963) is a Sierra Leonean journalist. He is best known for two CNN documentary films: &quot;Cry Freetown&quot; (2000) and &quot;Exodus from Africa&quot; (2001). The self-funded &quot;Cry Freetown&quot; depicts the most brutal period of the civil war in Sierra Leone with RUF rebels capturing the capital city (January 1999). The film won, among other awards, an Emmy Award and a Peabody. &quot;Exodus from Africa&quot; shows the harrowing effort by the best of young African male blood to break through to Europe via death- and danger-ridden paths from Sierra Leone and Nigeria, via Mali, the Sahara desert, Algeria, and Morocco through the Strait of Gibraltar to Spain.

In his recent two projects &quot;Living with Hunger&quot; and &quot;Living with Refugees&quot; (nominated for an Emmy award), he takes reality television to its extreme, becoming the central character in the films by living the lifestyle of an Ethiopian villager and Sudanese refugee respectively; in doing this, he tries to break the boundary between &quot;us&quot; (the people watching on TV) and &quot;them&quot; (those before the camera) by becoming one of them (albeit for just a month). &quot;Living with Corruption&quot;, his latest documentary to be shown on CNN, describes the shocking reality of how corruption is spread across society both in Sierra Leone and Kenya, affecting mostly the poor.

In 2010, Samura investigated attitudes to homosexuality in Africa in the Dispatches documentary &quot;Africa&#x27;s Last Taboo&quot;, produced for Channel 4. Samura is also one of the directors of Insight News TV, an independent television production company in the UK focused on international current affairs programming.

Samura attended the Methodist Boys High School in the east end of Freetown. , he works in London, UK, and considers both London and Freetown his hometowns.

<text>Stephen Gary Wozniak (; born August 11, 1950), also known by his nickname Woz, is an American technology entrepreneur, electrical engineer, computer programmer, philanthropist, and inventor. In 1976, he co-founded Apple Computer with his early business partner Steve Jobs. Through his work at Apple in the 1970s and 1980s, he is widely recognized as one of the most prominent pioneers of the personal computer revolution.

In 1975, Wozniak started developing the Apple I into the computer that launched Apple when he and Jobs first began marketing it the following year. He was the primary designer of the Apple II, introduced in 1977, known as one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers, while Jobs oversaw the development of its foam-molded plastic case and early Apple employee Rod Holt developed its switching power supply. 

With human–computer interface expert Jef Raskin, Wozniak had a major influence over the initial development of the original Macintosh concepts from 1979 to 1981, when Jobs took over the project following Wozniak&#x27;s brief departure from the company due to a traumatic airplane accident. After permanently leaving Apple in 1985, Wozniak founded CL 9 and created the first programmable universal remote, released in 1987. He then pursued several other businesses and philanthropic ventures throughout his career, focusing largely on technology in K–12 schools.

As of June 2024, Wozniak has remained an employee of Apple in a ceremonial capacity since stepping down in 1985. In recent years, he has helped fund multiple entrepreneurial efforts dealing in areas such as GPS and telecommunications, flash memory, technology and pop culture conventions, technical education, ecology, satellites and more.

==Early life==
Stephen Gary Wozniak was born on August 11, 1950, in San Jose, California. His mother, Margaret Louise Wozniak (née Kern) (1923–2014), was from Washington state, and his father, Francis Jacob &quot;Jerry&quot; Wozniak (1925–1994) of Michigan, was an engineer for the Lockheed Corporation. Wozniak graduated from Homestead High School in 1968, in Cupertino, California. Steve has one brother, Mark Wozniak, a former tech executive who lives in Menlo Park. He also has one sister, Leslie Wozniak. She attended Homestead High School in Cupertino. She is a grant adviser at Five Bridges Foundation, which helps at-risk youths in San Francisco. She once said it was her mother who introduced activism to her and her siblings.
The name on Wozniak&#x27;s birth certificate is &quot;Stephan Gary Wozniak&quot;, but his mother said that she intended it to be spelled &quot;Stephen&quot;, which is what he uses. He has mentioned the surname &quot;Wozniak&quot; being Polish. In the early 1970s, Wozniak&#x27;s blue box design earned him the nickname &quot;Berkeley Blue&quot; in the phreaking community. Wozniak has credited watching &quot;Star Trek&quot; and attending &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions while in his youth as a source of inspiration for his starting Apple Computer. In his autobiography, &quot;iWoz&quot;, he also credits the Tom Swift Jr. books as an inspiration for becoming an engineer.

==Career==
===Pre-Apple===

In 1969, Wozniak returned to the San Francisco Bay Area after being expelled from the University of Colorado Boulder in his first year for hacking the university&#x27;s computer system. He re-enrolled at De Anza College in Cupertino before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley, in 1971. In June of that year, for a self-taught engineering project, Wozniak designed and built his first computer with his friend Bill Fernandez. 

Predating useful microprocessors, screens, and keyboards, and using punch cards and only 20 TTL chips donated by an acquaintance, they named it &quot;Cream Soda&quot; after their favorite beverage. A newspaper reporter stepped on the power supply cable and blew up the computer, but it served Wozniak as &quot;a good prelude to my thinking 5 years later with the Apple I and Apple II computers&quot;. Before focusing his attention on Apple, he was employed at Hewlett-Packard (HP), where he designed calculators. It was during this time that he dropped out of Berkeley and befriended Steve Jobs.

Wozniak was introduced to Jobs by Fernandez, who attended Homestead High School with Jobs in 1971. Jobs and Wozniak became friends when Jobs worked for the summer at HP, where Wozniak, too, was employed, working on a mainframe computer.

Their first business partnership began later that year when Wozniak read an article titled &quot;Secrets of the Little Blue Box&quot; from the October 1971 issue of &quot;Esquire&quot;, and started to build his own &quot;blue boxes&quot; that enabled one to make long-distance phone calls at no cost. Jobs, who handled the sales of the blue boxes, managed to sell some two hundred of them for $150 each, and split the profit with Wozniak. Jobs later told his biographer that if it had not been for Wozniak&#x27;s blue boxes, &quot;there wouldn&#x27;t have been an Apple.&quot;

In 1973, Jobs was working for arcade game company Atari, Inc. in Los Gatos, California. He was assigned to create a circuit board for the arcade video game &quot;Breakout&quot;. According to Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell, Atari offered $100 () for each chip that was eliminated in the machine. Jobs had little knowledge of circuit board design and made a deal with Wozniak to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips. Wozniak reduced the number of chips by 50, by using RAM for the brick representation. The fact that this prototype had no scoring or coin mechanisms meant Woz&#x27;s prototype could not be used. Jobs was paid the full bonus regardless. Jobs told Wozniak that Atari gave them only $700 and that Wozniak&#x27;s share was thus $350 (). Wozniak did not learn about the actual $5,000 bonus () until ten years later. While dismayed, he said that if Jobs had told him about it and had said he needed the money, Wozniak would have given it to him.

In 1975, Wozniak began designing and developing the computer that would eventually make him famous, the Apple I. With the Apple I, Wozniak was largely working to impress other members of the Palo Alto–based Homebrew Computer Club, a local group of electronics hobbyists interested in computing. The club was one of several key centers which established the home hobbyist era, essentially creating the microcomputer industry over the next few decades. Unlike other custom Homebrew designs, the Apple had an easy-to-achieve video capability that drew a crowd when it was unveiled.

===Apple formation and success===


By March 1, 1976, Wozniak completed the basic design of the Apple I computer. He alone designed the hardware, circuit board designs, and operating system for the computer. Wozniak originally offered the design to HP while working there, but was denied by the company on five occasions. Jobs then advised Wozniak to start a business of their own to build and sell bare printed circuit boards of the Apple I. Wozniak, at first skeptical, was later convinced by Jobs that even if they were not successful they could at least say to their grandchildren that they had had their own company. To raise the money they needed to build the first batch of the circuit boards, Wozniak sold his HP scientific calculator while Jobs sold his Volkswagen van.

On April 1, 1976, Jobs and Wozniak formed the Apple Computer Company (now called Apple Inc.) along with administrative supervisor Ronald Wayne, whose participation in the new venture was short-lived. The two decided on the name &quot;Apple&quot; shortly after Jobs returned from Oregon and told Wozniak about his time spent on an apple orchard there.

After the company was formed, Jobs and Wozniak made one last trip to the Homebrew Computer Club to give a presentation of the fully assembled version of the Apple I. Paul Terrell, who was starting a new computer shop in Mountain View, California, called the Byte Shop, saw the presentation and was impressed by the machine. Terrell told Jobs that he would order 50 units of the Apple I and pay $500 () each on delivery, but only if they came fully assembled, as he was not interested in buying bare printed circuit boards.

Together the duo assembled the first boards in Jobs&#x27;s parents&#x27; Los Altos home; initially in his bedroom and later (when there was no space left) in the garage. Wozniak&#x27;s apartment in San Jose was filled with monitors, electronic devices, and computer games that he had developed. The Apple I sold for $666.66. Wozniak later said he had no idea about the relation between the number and the mark of the beast, and that he came up with the price because he liked &quot;repeating digits&quot;. They sold their first 50 system boards to Terrell later that year.
In November 1976, Jobs and Wozniak received substantial funding from a then-semi-retired Intel product marketing manager and engineer named Mike Markkula. At the request of Markkula, Wozniak resigned from his job at HP and became the vice president in charge of research and development at Apple. Wozniak&#x27;s Apple I was similar to the Altair 8800, the first commercially available microcomputer, except the Apple I had no provision for internal expansion cards. With expansion cards, the Altair could attach to a computer terminal and be programmed in BASIC. In contrast, the Apple I was a hobbyist machine. Wozniak&#x27;s design included a $25 CPU (MOS 6502) on a single circuit board with 256 bytes of ROM, 4K or 8K bytes of RAM, and a 40-character by 24-row display controller. Apple&#x27;s first computer lacked a case, power supply, keyboard, and displayall components that had to be provided by the user. Eventually about 200 Apple I computers were produced in total.
After the success of the Apple I, Wozniak designed the Apple II, the first personal computer with the ability to display color graphics, and BASIC programming language built in. Inspired by &quot;the technique Atari used to simulate colors on its first arcade games&quot;, Wozniak found a way of putting colors into the NTSC system by using a chip, while colors in the PAL system are achieved by &quot;accident&quot; when a dot occurs on a line, and he says that to this day he has no idea how it works. During the design stage, Jobs argued that the Apple II should have two expansion slots, while Wozniak wanted eight. After a heated argument, during which Wozniak threatened that Jobs should &quot;go get himself another computer&quot;, they decided to go with eight slots. Jobs and Wozniak introduced the Apple II at the April 1977 West Coast Computer Faire. Wozniak&#x27;s first article about the Apple II was in &quot;Byte&quot; magazine in May 1977. It became one of the first highly successful mass-produced personal computers in the world. Wozniak also designed the Disk II floppy disk drive, released in 1978 specifically for use with the Apple II to replace the slower cassette tape storage.

In 1980, Apple went public to instant and significant financial profitability, making Jobs and Wozniak both millionaires. The Apple II&#x27;s intended successor, the Apple III, released the same year, was a commercial failure and was discontinued in 1984. According to Wozniak, the Apple III &quot;had 100 percent hardware failures&quot;, and that the primary reason for these failures was that the system was designed by Apple&#x27;s marketing department, unlike Apple&#x27;s previous engineering-driven projects.
During the early design and development phase of the original Macintosh, Wozniak had a heavy influence over the project along with Jef Raskin, who conceived the computer. Later named the &quot;Macintosh 128k&quot;, it would become the first mass-market personal computer featuring an integral graphical user interface and mouse. The Macintosh would also go on to introduce the desktop publishing industry with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. In a 2013 interview, Wozniak said that in 1981, &quot;Steve [Jobs] really took over the project when I had a plane crash and wasn&#x27;t there.&quot;

===Plane crash and temporary leave from Apple===
On February 7, 1981, the Beechcraft Bonanza A36TC which Wozniak was piloting (and not qualified to operate) crashed soon after takeoff from the Sky Park Airport in Scotts Valley, California. The airplane stalled while climbing, then bounced down the runway, broke through two fences, and crashed into an embankment. Wozniak and his three passengers—then-fiancée Candice Clark, her brother Jack Clark, and Jack&#x27;s girlfriend, Janet Valleau—were injured. Wozniak sustained severe face and head injuries, including losing a tooth, and also suffered for the following five weeks from anterograde amnesia, the inability to create new memories. He had no memory of the crash, and did not remember his name while in the hospital or the things he did for a time after he was released. He would later state that Apple II computer games were what helped him regain his memory. The National Transportation Safety Board investigation report cited premature liftoff and pilot inexperience as probable causes of the crash.

Wozniak did not immediately return to Apple after recovering from the airplane crash, seeing it as a good reason to leave. &quot;Infinite Loop&quot; characterized this time: &quot;Coming out of the semi-coma had been like flipping a reset switch in Woz&#x27;s brain. It was as if in his thirty-year old body he had regained the mind he&#x27;d had at eighteen before all the computer madness had begun. And when that happened, Woz found he had little interest in engineering or design. Rather, in an odd sort of way, he wanted to start over fresh.&quot;

===UC Berkeley and US Festivals===

Later in 1981, after recovering from the plane crash, Wozniak re-enrolled at UC Berkeley to complete his Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences degree that he started there in 1971 (and which he would finish in 1986). Because his name was well known at this point, he enrolled under the name Rocky Raccoon Clark, which is the name listed on his diploma, although he did not officially receive his degree in electrical engineering and computer sciences until 1987.

In May 1982 and 1983, Wozniak, with help from professional concert promoter Bill Graham, founded the company Unuson, an abbreviation of &quot;unite us in song&quot;, which sponsored two US Festivals, with &quot;US&quot; pronounced like the pronoun, not as initials. Initially intended to celebrate evolving technologies, the festivals ended up as a technology exposition and a rock festival as a combination of music, computers, television, and people. After losing several million dollars on the 1982 festival, Wozniak stated that unless the 1983 event turned a profit, he would end his involvement with rock festivals and get back to designing computers. Later that year, Wozniak returned to Apple product development, desiring no more of a role than that of an engineer and a motivational factor for the Apple workforce.

===Return to Apple product development===

Starting in the mid-1980s, as the Macintosh experienced slow but steady growth, Apple&#x27;s corporate leadership, including Steve Jobs, increasingly disrespected its flagship cash cow Apple II seriesand Wozniak along with it. The Apple II divisionother than Wozniakwas not invited to the Macintosh introduction event, and Wozniak was seen kicking the dirt in the parking lot. Although Apple II products provided about 85% of Apple&#x27;s sales in early 1985, the company&#x27;s January 1985 annual meeting did not mention the Apple II division or its employees, a typical situation that frustrated Wozniak.

===Final departure from Apple workforce===
Even with the success he had helped to create at Apple, Wozniak believed that the company was hindering him from being who he wanted to be, and that it was &quot;the bane of his existence&quot;. He enjoyed engineering, not management, and said that he missed &quot;the fun of the early days&quot;. As other talented engineers joined the growing company, he no longer believed he was needed there. By early 1985, Wozniak left Apple again and sold most of his stock. Media coverage attributed his departure to disagreements with Apple management, quoting his statement that Apple had &quot;been going in the wrong direction for the last five years&quot;, but Wozniak later objected to this portrayal and stated that he left primarily because he was excited to start CL 9 and recapture the fun of developing a new technology.

The Apple II platform financially carried the company well into the Macintosh era of the late 1980s; it was made semi-portable with the Apple IIc of 1984, and was extended, with some input from Wozniak, by the 16-bit Apple IIGS of 1986, and was discontinued altogether when the Apple IIe was discontinued on November 15, 1993 (although the Apple IIe card, which allowed compatible Macintosh computers to run Apple II software and use certain Apple II peripherals, was produced until May 1995).

===Post-Apple===

After his career at Apple, Wozniak founded CL 9 in 1985, which developed and brought the first programmable universal remote control to market in 1987, called the &quot;CORE&quot;. Beyond engineering, Wozniak&#x27;s second lifelong goal had always been to teach elementary school because of the important role teachers play in students&#x27; lives. Eventually, he did teach computer classes to children from the fifth through ninth grades, and teachers as well. Unuson continued to support this, funding additional teachers and equipment.

In 2001, Wozniak founded Wheels of Zeus (WOZ) to create wireless GPS technology to &quot;help everyday people find everyday things much more easily&quot;. In 2002, he joined the board of directors of Ripcord Networks, Inc., joining Apple alumni Ellen Hancock, Gil Amelio, Mike Connor, and Wheels of Zeus co-founder Alex Fielding in a new telecommunications venture. Later the same year he joined the board of directors of Danger, Inc., the maker of the Hip Top.

In 2006, Wheels of Zeus was closed, and Wozniak founded Acquicor Technology, a holding company for acquiring technology companies and developing them, with Apple alumni Hancock and Amelio. From 2009 through 2014 he was chief scientist at Fusion-io. In 2014 he became chief scientist at Primary Data, which was founded by some former Fusion-io executives. Silicon Valley Comic Con (SVCC) is an annual pop culture and technology convention at the San Jose McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, California. The convention was co-founded by Wozniak and Rick White, with Trip Hunter as CEO. Wozniak announced the annual event in 2015 along with Marvel legend Stan Lee. In October 2017, Wozniak founded Woz U, an online educational technology service for independent students and employees. As of December 2018, Woz U was licensed as a school with the Arizona state board.

Though permanently leaving Apple as an active employee in 1985, Wozniak chose to never remove himself from the official employee list, and continues to represent the company at events or in interviews. Today he receives a stipend from Apple for this role, estimated in 2006 to be per year. He is also an Apple shareholder. He maintained a friendly acquaintance with Steve Jobs until Jobs&#x27;s death in October 2011. However, in 2006, Wozniak stated that he and Jobs were not as close as they used to be. 

In a 2013 interview, Wozniak said that the original Macintosh &quot;failed&quot; under Steve Jobs, and that it was not until Jobs left that it became a success. He called the Apple Lisa group the team that had kicked Jobs out, and that Jobs liked to call the Lisa group &quot;idiots for making [the Lisa computer] too expensive&quot;. To compete with the Lisa, Jobs and his new team produced a cheaper computer, one that, according to Wozniak, was &quot;weak&quot;, &quot;lousy&quot; and &quot;still at a fairly high price&quot;. &quot;He made it by cutting the RAM down, by forcing you to swap disks here and there&quot;, says Wozniak. He attributed the eventual success of the Macintosh to people like John Sculley &quot;who worked to build a Macintosh market when the Apple II went away&quot;.

At the end of 2020, Wozniak announced the launch of a new company helmed by him, Efforce. Efforce is described as a marketplace for funding ecologically friendly projects. It used a WOZX cryptocurrency token for funding and blockchain to redistribute the profit to token holders and businesses engaged on the platform. In September 2021, it was reported that Wozniak was also starting a company alongside co-founder Alex Fielding named Privateer Space to address the problem of space debris. Privateer Space debuted the first version of its space traffic monitoring software on March 1, 2022. In 2024, Wozniak sued YouTube in respect to a scam that was being circulated on the platform using his likeness. Later, he won after a San Jose appeals court ruled YouTube was liable for failing to combat it.

==Inventions==

Wozniak is listed as the sole inventor on the following Apple patents:
* US Patent No. 4,136,359: &quot;Microcomputer for use with video display&quot;—for which he was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.
* US Patent No. 4,210,959: &quot;Controller for magnetic disc, recorder, or the like&quot;
* US Patent No. 4,217,604: &quot;Apparatus for digitally controlling PAL color display&quot;
* US Patent No. 4,278,972: &quot;Digitally-controlled color signal generation means for use with display&quot;

==Philanthropy==
In 1990, Wozniak helped found the Electronic Frontier Foundation, providing some of the organization&#x27;s initial funding and serving on its founding Board of Directors. He is the founding sponsor of the Tech Museum, Silicon Valley Ballet and Children&#x27;s Discovery Museum of San Jose. Also since leaving Apple, Wozniak has provided all the money, and much onsite technical support, for the technology program in his local school district in Los Gatos. Un.U.Son. (Unite Us In Song), an organization Wozniak formed to organize the two US festivals, is now primarily tasked with supporting his educational and philanthropic projects. In 1986, Wozniak lent his name to the Stephen G. Wozniak Achievement Awards (popularly known as &quot;Wozzie Awards&quot;), which he presented to six Bay Area high school and college students for their innovative use of computers in the fields of business, art, and music. Wozniak is the subject of a student-made film production of his friend&#x27;s (Joe Patane) nonprofit Dream Camp Foundation for high-level-need youth entitled &quot;Camp Woz: The Admirable Lunacy of Philanthropy&quot;.

==Views on artificial superintelligence==

In March 2015, Wozniak stated that while he had originally dismissed Ray Kurzweil&#x27;s opinion that machine intelligence would outpace human intelligence within several decades, Wozniak had changed his mind: Wozniak stated that he had started to identify a contradictory sense of foreboding about artificial intelligence, while still supporting the advance of technology.

By June 2015, Wozniak changed his mind again, stating that a superintelligence takeover would be good for humans: 

In 2016, Wozniak changed his mind again, stating that he no longer worried about the possibility of superintelligence emerging because he is skeptical that computers will be able to compete with human &quot;intuition&quot;: &quot;A computer could figure out a logical endpoint decision, but that&#x27;s not the way intelligence works in humans&quot;. Wozniak added that if computers do become superintelligent, &quot;they&#x27;re going to be partners of humans over all other species just forever&quot;. 

Wozniak signed a 2023 open letter from the Future of Life Institute calling for &quot;all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4&quot;. In an interview to the BBC in May 2023 Wozniak said that AI may make scams more difficult to detect, noting that &quot;AI is so intelligent it&#x27;s open to the bad players, the ones that want to trick you about who they are&quot;.

==Personal life==

Wozniak lives in Los Gatos, California. He applied for Australian citizenship in 2012, and has stated that he would like to live in Melbourne, Australia in the future. Wozniak has been referred to frequently by the nickname &quot;Woz&quot;, or &quot;The Woz&quot;; he has also been called &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Woz&quot; and &quot;The Second Steve&quot; (in regard to his early business partner and longtime friend, Steve Jobs). &quot;WoZ&quot; (short for &quot;Wheels of Zeus&quot;) is the name of a company he founded in 2002; it closed in 2006.

Wozniak describes his impetus for joining the Freemasons in 1979 as being able to spend more time with his then-wife, Alice Robertson, who belonged to the Order of the Eastern Star, associated with the Masons. He was initiated in 1979 at Charity Lodge No. 362 in Campbell, California, now part of Mt. Moriah Lodge No. 292 in Los Gatos. Today he is no longer involved: &quot;I did become a Freemason and know what it&#x27;s about but it doesn&#x27;t really fit my tech/geek personality. Still, I can be polite to others from other walks of life. After our divorce was filed I never attended again but I did contribute enough for a lifetime membership.&quot;

Wozniak was married to slalom canoe gold-medalist Candice Clark from June 1981 to 1987. They have three children together, the youngest being born after their divorce was finalized. After a high-profile relationship with actress Kathy Griffin, who described him on &quot;Tom Green&#x27;s House Tonight&quot; in 2008 as &quot;the biggest techno-nerd in the Universe&quot;, Wozniak married Janet Hill, his current spouse. On his religious views, Wozniak has called himself an &quot;atheist or agnostic&quot;.

He is a member of a Segway Polo team, the &quot;Silicon Valley Aftershocks&quot;, and is considered a &quot;super fan&quot; of the NHL ice hockey team San Jose Sharks. In 1998, he co-authored with Larry Wilde &quot;The Official Computer Freaks Joke Book&quot;. In 2006, he co-authored with Gina Smith his autobiography, &quot;iWoz: From Computer Geek to Cult Icon: How I Invented the Personal Computer, Co-Founded Apple, and Had Fun Doing It&quot;. The book made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

Wozniak has discussed his personal disdain for money and accumulating large amounts of wealth. He told &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine in 2017, &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to be near money, because it could corrupt your values ... I really didn&#x27;t want to be in that super &#x27;more than you could ever need&#x27; category.&quot; He also said that he only invests in things &quot;close to his heart&quot;. When Apple first went public in 1980, Wozniak offered $10 million of his own stock to early Apple employees, something Jobs refused to do.

He has the condition prosopagnosia (face blindness). Wozniak has expressed support for the right to repair movement. In July 2021, he made a Cameo video in response to right to repair activist Louis Rossmann, in which he described the issue as something that has &quot;really affected me emotionally&quot;, and credited Apple&#x27;s early breakthroughs to open technology of the 1970s. In November 2023, Wozniak suffered a minor stroke while preparing to speak at a conference in Mexico City. He was hospitalized briefly before returning home. Wozniak became a Serbian citizen in December 2023. He said that he and his wife Janet, who is also getting a passport, will from now on &quot;promote&quot; Serbia while living in the U.S.

<text>The Saxons, sometimes called the Old Saxons or Continental Saxons, were the Germanic people of early medieval &quot;Old&quot; Saxony () which became a Carolingian &quot;stem duchy&quot; in 804, in what is now northern Germany. Many of their neighbours were, like them, speakers of West Germanic dialects, including the inland Franks and Thuringians to the south, and the coastal Frisians and Angles to the north who were among the peoples who were originally referred to as &quot;Saxons&quot; in the context of early raiding and settlements in Roman Britain and Gaul. To their east were Obotrites and other Slavic-speaking peoples.

The political history of these continental Saxons is unclear until the 8th century and the conflict between their semi-legendary hero Widukind and the Frankish emperor Charlemagne. They do not appear to have been politically united until about the generations leading up to that conflict, and before then they were reportedly ruled by regional &quot;satraps&quot;. Previous Frankish rulers of Austrasia, both Merovingian and Carolingian, fought numerous campaigns against Saxons, both in the west near the Lippe, Ems and Weser, and further east, near Thuringia and Bohemia, in the area which later medieval sources referred to as &quot;North Swabia&quot;. 

Charlemagne conquered all the Saxons after winning the long Saxon Wars (772–804), and forced them to convert to Christianity, annexing Saxony into the Carolingian domain. Under the Carolingian Franks, Saxony became a single duchy, fitting it within the basic political structure of the later Holy Roman Empire. The early rulers of this Duchy of Saxony expanded their territories, and therefore those of the Holy Roman empire, to the east, at the expense of Slavic-speaking Wends. 

Long before any clear historical mention of Saxony as a country, the name &quot;Saxons&quot; was also used to refer to coastal raiders who attacked the Roman Empire from north of the Rhine, in a similar sense to the much later term &quot;Viking&quot;. These early raiders and settlers included Frisians, Angles and Jutes, and the term Saxon was not at that time a term for any specific tribe. There is however a single possible classical reference to a smaller and much earlier Saxon tribe, but the interpretation of this text (&quot;Axones&quot; in most surviving manuscripts) is disputed. According to this proposal, the original Saxon tribe lived north of the mouth of the Elbe, close to the probable homeland of the Angles, in the Saxon area which came to be known later as Nordalbingia.

Today the Saxons of Germany no longer form a distinctive ethnic group or country, but their name lives on in the names of several regions and states of Germany, including Lower Saxony () which includes most of the original duchy. Their language evolved into Low German which was the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Hanseatic League, but has faced a long and gradual decline since the Late Medieval period as a literary, administrative and, to a significant extent, cultural language in favor of Dutch and German.

==Name of the Saxons and Anglo-Saxons==

The name of the Saxons has traditionally been said to derive from a kind of knife used in this period and called a in Old English, and in Old High German. 

The term &quot;Saxon&quot; was first definitely used in written records to describe coastal raiders who attacked the Roman Empire from regions north of the Rhine using boats. At this time, the term had a similar sense to the much later term &quot;Viking&quot;. These early raiders and settlers called Saxons included Frisians, Angles and Jutes, whose countries stretched from what is now the Netherlands to what is now Denmark, and included coastal parts of the territory which came to be called Saxony. It has been proposed that these coastal Saxons and the later Saxons of Carolingian times should be seen as distinct but related peoples, who were referred to by the same name, such as the Dutch and &quot;Deutschen&quot; (Germans) today. 

Significant numbers of these early Saxons settled within the empire, in what later became northern France and England. England, rather than Saxony, was sometimes written of as the Saxon homeland. To avoid confusion, later writers in the eighth century such as Bede and the author of the &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot; referred to the Saxons of Saxony in Germany as the &quot;old Saxons&quot;, and their country as &quot;old Saxony&quot;, and this differentiation is still often used by historians today when discussing this period. In contrast, the settlers once called Saxons in England became part of a new Old English-speaking nation, now commonly referred to as the Anglo Saxons, or simply &quot;the English&quot;. This brought together local Romano-British populations, Saxons, and other migrants from the same North Sea region, including Frisians, Jutes, and Angles. The Angles are the source of the term &quot;English&quot; which became the more commonly-used collective term. The term &quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot;, combining the names of the Angles and the Saxons, also came into use by the eighth century, initially in the work of Paul the Deacon, to distinguish the Germanic-speaking inhabitants of Britain from continental Saxons. However, both the Saxons of Britain and those of Old Saxony in northern Germany long continued to be referred to as &quot;Saxons&quot; in an indiscriminate manner.

==Possible mention in Ptolemy (2nd century AD)==

Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot;, written in the second century, is sometimes considered to contain the first mention of the Saxons. Some copies of this text mention a tribe called &quot;Saxones&quot; in the area just to the north of the lower Elbe, and there were also three islands north of the Elbe&#x27;s mouth which were called the Saxon islands. However, other versions refer to the same tribe as &quot;Axones&quot;. Some scholars such as Mathias Springer have proposed that this may be a misspelling of the tribe that Tacitus in his &quot;Germania&quot; called &quot;Aviones&quot;. According to this theory, &quot;Saxones&quot; was the result of later scribes trying to correct a name that meant nothing to them. On the other hand, Schütte, in his analysis of such problems in &quot;Ptolemy&#x27;s Maps of Northern Europe&quot;, believed that &quot;Saxones&quot; is correct. He notes that the loss of first letters occurs in numerous places in various copies of Ptolemy&#x27;s work, and also that the manuscripts without &quot;Saxones&quot; are generally inferior overall. According to Liccardo &quot;Even though the reference is found in a section of the &quot;Geographia&quot; difficult to interpret, the scholarly consensus considers this passage to be genuine&quot;. 

For the majority of scholars who accept the existence of Saxons in Ptolemy, their reappearance as a much more important and widespread people in third century records is nonetheless remarkable.

==Saxon raiders (3rd and 4th centuries AD)==
Eutropius the historian, a contemporary and companion of emperor Julian (died 363), claimed that Saxon and Frankish raiders had already attacked the North Sea coast near Boulogne-sur-Mer almost a century earlier in about 285, when Carausius was posted there to defend against them. However, because the terms Saxon and Frank were used for peoples from north of the Rhine in the time Eutropius and Julian, it is very likely that he was using the terms anachronistically. The &quot;Panegyrici Latini&quot;, which were written soon after those events instead mention Franks, Chamavi and Frisians, but not Saxons, indicating that these and possibly others entered the Rhine and Scheldt delta areas within the empire and held control of it for decades. The panegyrics seem to imply that the Chamavi and Frisians were types of Franks, at this time. The area was brought under Roman governance, by Constantius Chlorus, who settled many of the conquered in underpopulated parts of Gaul. Constantius also defeated the rebel Carausius in Britain, and his Roman forces are said to have slaughtered barbarian mercenaries there, and &quot;those who lately imitated the barbarian in their mode of dress and flowing red hair&quot;. 

The first undisputed mentions of the Saxon name come from the 4th century. In about 314 AD the Laterculus Veronensis mentions the Saxons in a list of barbarian peoples under the influence of Rome. By about 400 AD the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; shows that the Romans (perhaps already much earlier) had created several military commands specifically to defend against Saxon raiders. The (&#x27;Saxon Shore&#x27;), was composed of nine forts stretching around the south-eastern corner of England. On the other side of the English channel two coastal military commands were created, over the &quot;Tractus Armoricanus&quot; in what is now Brittany and Normandy, and the coast of Belgica Secunda in what later became Flanders and Picardy. The &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; also lists the existence of a Saxon military unit (an &quot;Ala&quot;) in the Roman military, which was stationed in what is now Lebanon and northern Palestine. This already existed by 363 when Julian used them in Arabia against the Persian empire. Roman military accessories are found in northern Germany in the 4th and 5th centuries apparently indicating the return of soldiers who had served the empire. 

During the 4th century Julian himself mentioned the Saxons in a speech as close allies of Magnentius in 350 when he declared himself emperor in Gaul. Julian described the Saxons and Franks as kinsmen of Magnentius himself, living &quot;beyond the Rhine and on the shores of the western sea&quot;. In 357/8 Julian apparently came into conflict with Saxons himself when he campaigned in the Rhine regions against Alemanni, Franks and Saxons. The later historian Zosimus, writing about 500 AD about this period, reported the involvement of the Saxons, &quot;who exceed all the barbarians in those regions, in courage, strength and hardiness&quot;. They sent out, according to Zosimus, the &quot;Quadi&quot;, a part of the Saxons, against the Roman lands but they were blocked by the Franks who resided near them. These &quot;Quadi&quot; therefore used boats to get around the Franks, and made it to Batavia (Betuwe) in the Rhine delta. Scholars generally believe the name &quot;Quadi&quot; to be a mistake, perhaps by a copyist. Based upon other more contemporary reports of these campaigns it is likely he was referring to the Chamavi, who were however normally listed as Franks. This implies that the term &quot;Saxon&quot; was probably not a clear ethnic distinction at this time, but perhaps rather designated those who attack by boat. 

Several more records mentioning 4th century Saxons can be dated:
*In 368, during the reign of Valentinian I, Ammianus (books 26 and 27) reported that Britain was troubled by the Scoti, two tribes of Picts (the Dicalydones and Verturiones), the Attacotti and the Saxons. Count Theodosius, the father of the future emperor Theodosius I led a successful campaign to recover control in Britain. In an inscription preserved in Stobi in North Macedonia Theodosius was described as the terror of Saxony. This is the earliest known reference to a country of the Saxons apart from the disputed mention by Ptolemy, but this Saxony is likely to be in Britain. A poetic account of his battle with the Saxons associates it with the Orkney islands off Scotland, but he probably also battled Saxons in the Rhine delta region. 
*In Gaul in 370 (Ammianus, books 28 and 30) the Saxons &quot;overcoming the dangers of the Ocean advanced at rapid pace towards the Roman frontier&quot; invading the maritime districts in Gaul. Valentinian&#x27;s forces tricked and overwhelmed them, by a &quot;device which was treacherous but expedient&quot;, &quot;and stripped of their booty the robbers thus forcibly crushed had almost returned enriched with the spoils which they took&quot;.
*In 373 Saxons were defeated at a place called Deuso which was in Frankish, but not Roman territory. This was therefore probably an early mention of an inland force of Saxons.
*Not long before the usurper emperor Magnus Maximus died in 388, according to Bishop Ambrose of Milan, he was attacked by Franks and Saxons as divine retribution for his rebuilding of a synagogue burned down in Rome.
*In 393 Saxons died as gladiators in Rome.

In many cases the Saxons were associated with using boats for their raids, although the first mentions also involve attacks within the Rhine-Maas delta region. Special mentions of the fearful 4th-century Saxon coastal surprise attacks were made not only by Ammianus, but also by the poet Claudian.

==5th century AD==
In the 5th century, many records link Saxons with Britain and Gaul, although a rough description of the homeland of these Saxons was given by Hilarion who says the Frankish homeland lay between the Saxons and Alemanni, placing them therefore north of the Franks. It is likely that the term Saxon was still mainly being used to describe northern raiders in general, and not a specific people. Writing in the Byzantine empire in the 6th century, the historian Procopius described only three large nations living in &quot;Brittia&quot;, Angles, Frisians, and Britons, and he does not mention Saxons at all. The reputation for shocking coastal raids continued. In the late 5th century a dramatic description of Saxon raiding was written by Sidonius Apollinaris writing to a friend who was assigned to a coastal defensive post in Saintonge near Bordeaux.

Early in this period it is believed that Stilicho, the most powerful military leader in the western Roman empire until 408, campaigned in Britain and northern Gaul, and reorganized the defences against the Saxons. Later in his career a series of crises in Italy, Gaul, Iberia and North Africa meant that military resources were not available for Britain. According to the &quot;Chronica Gallica of 452&quot;, which was probably written in present day southern France, Britain was ravaged by Saxon invaders in 409 or 410. By this time, Constantine &quot;III&quot; was declared emperor in Britain and Gaul. He was killed in 411. The Romano-British citizens reportedly expelled their Roman officials during this period, and never again re-joined the Roman empire. Writing in the mid-sixth century, Procopius states that after the overthrow of Constantine &quot;III&quot; in 411, &quot;the Romans never succeeded in recovering Britain, but it remained from that time under tyrants.&quot;

In 441–442 AD, Saxons are mentioned in the &quot;Chronica Gallica of 452&quot; which says that the &quot;British provinces, which to this time had suffered various defeats and misfortunes, are reduced to Saxon rule&quot;. Gildas, writing in the 6th century, apparently knew of these same events from his grandparents&#x27; generation. According to him, a Saxon force based in the east of Britain (Bede writing in the eighth century believed they were based on the Isle of Thanet) were invited as &quot;foederati&quot; to Britain, in order to help defend against raids by Picts and Scots. They revolted over their pay and plundered the whole country, initiating a long war which the Romano-British eventually won. However, Britain was now divided into corrupt &quot;tyrannies&quot;. There are very few records of the period, but by the time of Bede in the 8th century most of England was ruled by Anglo-Saxon kingdoms.

In what is now France, during the 460s, an apparent fragment of a chronicle preserved in the &quot;History of the Franks&quot; of Gregory of Tours, gives a confusing report about a number of battles involving one &quot;Adovacrius&quot;, who led a group of Saxons based upon islands somewhere near the Loire. He took hostages at Anger in France, but his force was subsequently retaken by Roman and Frankish forces led by Childeric I, a Frank. A &quot;great war was waged between the Saxons and the Romans but the Saxons, turning their backs, with the Romans pursuing, lost many of their men to the sword. Their islands were captured and ravaged by the Franks, many people being killed.&quot; Though there is no consensus, many historians believe that this Adovacrius may be the same person as Odoacer, the future king of Italy, who is mentioned in the same part of Gregory&#x27;s text as a person who subsequently allied with Childeric to fight Alemanni in Italy.

==Saxons in Germany during the Merovingian period==

In comparison to mentions of the early Saxons raiders and settlers in Britain or Gaul, there are few mentions of the Saxons in Germany before the 8th century. Interpretation of the records is also complicated not only by the continuing references to the other Saxons, but also because the Saxons living in present day Germany probably weren&#x27;t originally unified within one Saxon political entity. It is therefore not clear whether some early continental &quot;Saxons&quot; could also sometimes have come under other designations such as Warini, Frisians or Thuringians. Nevertheless some records during Merovingian times are clearly about Saxons living within what is now Northern Germany, north of the Franks.
*In about 531 the Franks, led by the eldest son of Clovis I, Theuderic I conquered the still independent kingdom of Thuringia, which henceforth became a kingdom under Frankish overlordship. Centuries later, medieval writers claimed that the early Saxons had assisted the Franks, and even that they had been brought from England for this purpose, but no contemporary sources mention this, and historians doubt that there was any conflict between the Saxons and the Thuringian kingdom.
*In 555, after the death of Theuderic&#x27;s grandson Theudebald, Theuderic&#x27;s younger half-brother Clothar I (also spelled Lothar) inherited rule over the Rhine regions. It is reported by Gregory of Tours (IV.10) and Marius of Avenches that Saxons &quot;revolted&quot;, and the new ruler Clothar led an army in 556 to ravage Saxony and Thuringia. Thuringia, both authors mention, had supported the Saxons. In a possibly separate incident Gregory reports that Chlothar fought Saxons in 556 or 557 who had been stirred up by his own brother Childebert I to attack his territory, going as far as Deutz on the Rhine. (Springer argues against assuming that this was one incident, or involved one single group of Saxons, because Thuringia is quite far from Deutz.) Gregory of Tours (IV.14), pursuing an ethical topic which he is known for, reported that Chlothar was forced to fight by the Franks who did not want to negotiate, and that the Franks were subsequently beaten. However, later records indicate that a group of Saxons began paying tribute to the kings of Austrasia during Chlothar&#x27;s reign.
*Sigebert I, the son of Clothar I who ruled Austrasia until 575, was praised by the poet Venantius Fortunatus for defeating the &quot;Thuringian Saxons&quot;. (Springer suggests that this was his way of distinguishing the mainland Saxons from the Anglo-Saxons of Britain.)
*In 612, Sigebert&#x27;s grandson Theuderic II attacked his own brother Theudebert II at Zülpich, with a force of Saxons, Thuringians, and other people from east of the Rhine.
*Heroic stories set in the 620s were written centuries later about Sigbert&#x27;s nephew and eventual successor in Austrasia, Chlothar II and his defeat of Saxons led by Berthoald near the Weser, together with son Dagobert I.
*In 632, Dagobert I, son of Clothar II, and the most powerful king of the Franks at that time, was met by Saxon messengers in Mainz in a period of war with the Wends under Samo, who were attacking Thuringia. These Saxons negotiated, or attempted to negotiate, the end of a tribute of 500 cows per year which they had been paying, in return for a promise to defend against the Wends at their own expense.

There were also Saxon populations in this period who were living in neither England, nor what would become Saxony. 
*In 568/9, some Saxons were living in the Austrasian kingdom of Sigebert II, possibly in the Champagne region, and they accompanied the Lombards into Italy under the leadership of Alboin and settled there for some time. Sigebert in the meantime allowed a Suevian group to replace them in Austrasia. In 572, they returned to Gaul from Italy, raiding south-eastern Gaul as far as &quot;Stablo&quot;, now Estoublon, and were defeated by the Gallo-Roman general Mummolus. They were allowed to return to Italy, gather their families and belongings and return to pass through the region again to go north. After once again plundering the countryside, they were stopped at the Rhône by Mummolus and forced to pay compensation for what they had robbed. Upon arrival at their original home they were furious about the Suevian settlers, and refused to negotiate against them. Gregory of Tours, our main source for these events, claims that there was divine intervention, allowing the much smaller Suebian group to utterly defeat the Saxons in two battles.
*One notable group lived on the Normandy coast, near Bayeux. In 589, the Saxons from the Bessin region near Bayeux wore their hair in the Breton fashion at the orders of Fredegund and fought with them as allies against Guntram. Beginning in 626, the Saxons of the Bessin were used by Dagobert I for his campaigns against the Basques. In 843 and 846 under king Charles the Bald, other official documents mention a &quot;pagus&quot; called &quot;Otlinga Saxonia&quot; in the Bessin region, but the meaning of &quot;Otlinga&quot; is unclear.
*In southwestern France, in the late 6th century Chulderic the Saxon became a Duke north of the Garonne for Childeric II, after having previously been a subject of King Guntram. A century later, Aeghyna, a &quot;Duke of Gascony&quot;, died in 638. Both men are likely to have been Bayeux Saxons, although they may for example have come from Britain.

== The Saxons and the Arnulfings ==

The continental Saxons appear to have become consolidated by the end of the eighth century, partly as a result of interaction with the powerful Frankish kingdoms. The ancestors of Charlemagne, the Arnulfings, took control of the neighbouring Austrasian kingdom of the Franks and sought to assert power over the peoples to the east including not only the Bavarians, Swabians and Thuringians, which were long under Frankish rule, but also the Saxons and Frisians. They also pressured the Saxons and Frisians to convert to Christianity. In 804 the emperor Charlemagne conquered the Saxons, and incorporated the Saxons into the Frankish empire as a Stem Duchy, similar to the older ones although there is no evidence that it had previously been a single kingdom. The Duchy of Saxony (804–1296) covered Westphalia, Eastphalia, Angria and Nordalbingia, which is roughly equivalent to Holstein, the southern part of modern-day Schleswig-Holstein state, now bordering on Denmark.
*In the 690s, Bede reported that a people known as the &quot;Boructuari&quot; were invaded by the pagan Saxons during a period when the Saint Suibert, an Anglo-Saxon missionary bishop assigned to Frisia at that time, who was doing missionary work in the area. This was probably near Frisia, and the area is widely believed to correspond to the Roman-era Bructeri, who lived had once lived near the Lippe river.
*From the same report of Bede about English missionaries in the 690s the Two Ewalds were killed somewhere in Saxony while trying to convert one of the &quot;satraps&quot; of Saxony. The Ewalds apparently had the support of this local ruler, and also Pepin of Herstal who was the effective ruler of Frankish Austrasia at this time. 
*In 715, not long after the death of Pepin of Herstal, Frankish annals report that Saxons took control of &quot;Hattuaria&quot;. In later centuries this name was given to the Frankish country near Cleves and Xanten, between Rhine and Maas, but the area involved in this takeover may have been on opposite side of the Rhine. It is named after a Roman era Frankish tribe, the Chattuarii, who had once been the eastern neighbours of the Bructeri. Ammianus Marcellinus reported them to be living north of the Rhine in the 4th century.
*In 718, Charles Martel, the son of Pepin, invaded Saxony as far as the Weser. He campaigned there again in 720, 724, 738, and possibly also in 722 and 728. 
*In the 730s, Bede wrote his &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, which mentions, for example, that the land of the Angles was once between those of the Saxons and Jutes, but was now empty. 
*Also in about this period the &quot;Ravenna Cosmography&quot; was written which uses the same term &quot;Old Saxony&quot; to refer to the apparent continental homeland of the British Saxons who the writer understood to have came from this Old Saxony with their leader named Ansehis. It describes the lands of the Saxons as lying on the Ocean coast between Frisia and the Danes. It also borders on Thuringia and contains the rivers &quot;Lamizon&quot;, &quot;Ipada&quot;, &quot;Lippa&quot; and &quot;Limac&quot; (generally interpreted as the Ems, Pader, Lippe and Leine). This work names its source as a Gothic geographer named Marcomir, who had written an earlier study of Saxony.
*In 743 two of the sons of Charles, Pepin the Short and Carloman, marched against Odilo of Bavaria, who was nominally a Frankish subject. Carloman then turned north towards Saxony, or a part of it, which had sent troops to support Bavaria. After conquering the &quot;castrum&quot; of Ho(o)hseoburg forced the Saxon duke (war leader) Theoderic to surrender at a &quot;placitum&quot; held at that same place. The brothers invaded Saxony again the next year (744) and Theoderic was captured.
*In 748 Pepin the Short marched through Thuringia to Saxony, during a period when his half brother Grifo was attempting seize power in Bavaria. The part of Saxony beyond Thuringia where he went is referred to in the Annals of Metz as &quot;North Swabia&quot; and many of the Saxons there converted to Christianity at this time. The continuation of the Chronicle of Fredegar claims that they accepted to return to go back to paying a tribute of 500 cows.
*In 751 Pepin was crowned as king, and in 753 he attacked the Saxons northeast of the Rhine in the area of Bad Iburg and Bad Oeynhausen.
*In 758 Pepin attacked Saxony once more and agreed to a tribute of 330 horses per year from the defeated Saxons.

==Charlemagne&#x27;s Saxon Wars==

The Saxons were conquered by Charlemagne after a long series of annual campaigns, the Saxon Wars (772804). With defeat came enforced baptism and conversion as well as the union of the Saxons with the rest of the Frankish empire. Their sacred tree or pillar, a symbol of Irminsul, was destroyed. Charlemagne deported 10,000 Nordalbingian Saxons to Neustria and gave their largely vacant lands in Wagria (approximately modern Plön and Ostholstein districts) to the loyal king of the Abotrites. Einhard, Charlemagne&#x27;s biographer, says on the closing of this grand conflict:

The war that had lasted so many years was at length ended by their acceding to the terms offered by the king; which were renunciation of their national religious customs and the worship of devils, acceptance of the sacraments of the Christian faith and religion, and union with the Franks to form one people.

The Saxons long resisted becoming Christians and being incorporated into the orbit of the Frankish kingdom. In 776 the Saxons promised to convert to Christianity and vow loyalty to the king, but, during Charlemagne&#x27;s campaign in Hispania (778), the Saxons advanced to Deutz on the Rhine and plundered along the river. This was an oft-repeated pattern when Charlemagne was distracted by other matters.

==The Duchy of Saxony==

Under Carolingian rule, the Saxons were reduced to tributary status. There is evidence that the Saxons, as well as Slavic tributaries such as the Abodrites and the Wends, often provided troops to their Carolingian overlords. The dukes of Saxony became kings (Henry I, the Fowler, 919) and later the first emperors (Henry&#x27;s son, Otto I, the Great) of Germany during the tenth century, but they lost this position in 1024. The duchy was divided in 1180 when Duke Henry the Lion refused to follow his cousin, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, into war in Lombardy.

During the High Middle Ages, under the Salian emperors and, later, under the Teutonic Knights, German settlers moved east of the Saale into the area of a western Slavic tribe, the Sorbs. The Sorbs were gradually Germanised. This region subsequently acquired the name Saxony through political circumstances, though it was initially called the March of Meissen. The rulers of Meissen acquired control of the Duchy of Saxe-Wittenberg (only a remnant of the previous Duchy) in 1423; they eventually applied the name &quot;Saxony&quot; to the whole of their kingdom. Since then, this part of eastern Germany has been referred to as Saxony (), a source of some misunderstanding about the original homeland of the Saxons, with a central part in the present-day German state of Lower Saxony ().

==Language==
Old English, associated with the Saxons in England, was closer to later recorded dialects of Old Frisian than the Old Saxon language. Old Frisian apparently once stretched along the North Sea coast from the northern Netherlands to southern Denmark, while Old Saxon originally didn&#x27;t extend to the coast. Linguists have noted that Old Frisian and Old Saxon, although neighbouring and related, did not form part of the same dialect continuum. In contrast, the Saxon dialects became part of the much larger Continental West Germanic continuum which stretched to the Alps, and can all be considered to be types of German. 

According to the historical linguist Elmar Seebold, this development can only be explained if continental Saxon society prior to the migration to Britain was effectively composed of two related, but different forms of West Germanic. In his view, the group of people who, in the 3rd century, first migrated southwards to what is now the northwestern portion of Lower Saxony spoke North Sea Germanic dialects closely related to Old Frisian and Old English. There, these migrants encountered an already present population whose language was significantly different from their own, i.e. belonging to the Weser–Rhine Germanic grouping, over whom they then formed an elite, lending their name to the subsequent tribal federation and region as a whole. Later, during the 5th century, as the Angles started migrating to Britain, the descendants of this elite joined them, while the descendants of the native inhabitants did not, or at least not significantly. As the languages of the Angles and this particular Saxon group were closely related, a continuum between Anglian and Saxon could form in Britain, which later became English. In the land of the Saxons itself, the departure of a large part of this former elite caused the sociopolitical landscape to change, and the original population, after the departure of the majority of the elite&#x27;s descendants, became so predominant that their dialects (presumably the language of the Chauci, the language of the Thuringians, and possibly other ancient tribes) prevailed and ultimately formed the basis for the Low Saxon dialects known today, while their speakers retained the tribal name.

==Culture==
===Social structure===
Bede, a Northumbrian writing around the year 730, remarks that &quot;the old (that is, the continental) Saxons have no king, but they are governed by several satraps who, during war, cast lots for leadership but who, in time of peace, are equal in power.&quot; The was divided into three provinces – Westphalia, Eastphalia and Angria – which comprised about one hundred &quot;pagi&quot; or &quot;Gaue&quot;. Each &quot;Gau&quot; had its own satrap with enough military power to level whole villages that opposed him.

In the mid-9th century, Nithard first described the social structure of the Saxons beneath their leaders. The caste structure was rigid; in the Saxon language the three castes, excluding slaves, were called the (related to the term &quot;aetheling&quot;), and . These terms were subsequently Latinised as or ; , or ; and , or . According to very early traditions that are presumed to contain a good deal of historical truth, the were the descendants of the Saxons who led the tribe out of Holstein and during the migrations of the sixth century. They were a conquering warrior elite. The &#x27; represented the descendants of the , and of that caste. The represented the descendants of the original inhabitants of the conquered territories, who were forced to make oaths of submission and pay tribute to the &#x27;.

The &quot;Lex Saxonum&quot; regulated the Saxons&#x27; different society. Intermarriage between the castes was forbidden by the Lex Saxonum, and wergilds were set based upon caste membership. The &#x27; were worth 1,440 solidi, or about 700 head of cattle, the highest wergild on the continent; the price of a bride was also very high. This was six times as much as that of the &#x27; and eight times as much as the &quot;&quot;. The gulf between noble and ignoble was very large, but the difference between a freeman and an indentured labourer was small.

According to the , an important source for early Saxon history, the Saxons held an annual council at Marklo (Westphalia) where they &quot;confirmed their laws, gave judgment on outstanding cases, and determined by common counsel whether they would go to war or be in peace that year.&quot; All three castes participated in the general council; twelve representatives from each caste were sent from each &quot;Gau&quot;. In 782, Charlemagne abolished the system of &quot;Gaue&quot; and replaced it with the , the system of counties typical of Francia. By prohibiting the Marklo councils, Charlemagne pushed the &#x27; and &#x27; out of political power. The old Saxon system of , lordship based on dues and taxes, was replaced by a form of feudalism based on service and labour, personal relationships and oaths.

===Religion===

====Germanic religion====

Saxon religious practices were closely related to their political practices. The annual councils of the entire tribe began with invocations of the gods. The procedure by which dukes were elected in wartime, by drawing lots, is presumed to have had religious significance, i.e. in giving trust to divine providenceit seemsto guide the random decision-making. There were also sacred rituals and objects, such as the pillars called Irminsul; these were believed to connect heaven and earth, as with other examples of trees or ladders to heaven in numerous religions. Charlemagne had one such pillar chopped down in 772 close to the Eresburg stronghold.

Early Saxon religious practices in Britain can be gleaned from place names and the Germanic calendar in use at that time. The Germanic gods Woden, Frigg, Tiw and Thunor, who are attested to in every Germanic tradition, were worshipped in Wessex, Sussex and Essex. They are the only ones directly attested to, though the names of the third and fourth months (March and April) of the Old English calendar bear the names and , meaning &#x27;month of Hretha&#x27; and &#x27;month of Ēostre&#x27;. It is presumed that these are the names of two goddesses who were worshipped around that season. The Saxons offered cakes to their gods in February (). There was a religious festival associated with the harvest, (&#x27;holy month&#x27; or &#x27;month of offerings&#x27;, September). The Saxon calendar began on 25 December, and the months of December and January were called Yule (or ). They contained a or &#x27;night of the mothers&#x27;, another religious festival of unknown content.

The Saxon freemen and servile class remained faithful to their original beliefs long after their nominal conversion to Christianity. Nursing a hatred of the upper class, which, with Frankish assistance, had marginalised them from political power, the lower classes (the or ) were a problem for Christian authorities as late as 836. The remarks on their obstinacy in pagan (&#x27;usage and superstition&#x27;).

====Christianity====

The conversion of the Saxons in England from their original Germanic religion to Christianity occurred in the early to late seventh century under the influence of the already converted Jutes of Kent. In the 630s, Birinus became the &quot;apostle to the West Saxons&quot; and converted Wessex, whose first Christian king was Cynegils. The West Saxons begin to emerge from obscurity only with their conversion to Christianity and keeping written records. The Gewisse, a West Saxon people, were especially resistant to Christianity; Birinus exercised more efforts against them and ultimately succeeded in conversion. In Wessex, a bishopric was founded at Dorchester. The South Saxons were first evangelised extensively under Anglian influence; Aethelwalh of Sussex was converted by Wulfhere, King of Mercia and allowed Wilfrid, Bishop of York, to evangelise his people beginning in 681. The chief South Saxon bishopric was that of Selsey. The East Saxons were more pagan than the southern or western Saxons; their territory had a superabundance of pagan sites. Their king, Saeberht, was converted early and a diocese was established at London. Its first bishop, Mellitus, was expelled by Saeberht&#x27;s heirs. The conversion of the East Saxons was completed under Cedd in the 650s and 660s.

The continental Saxons were evangelised largely by English missionaries in the late seventh and early eighth centuries. Around 695, two early English missionaries, Hewald the White and Hewald the Black, were martyred by the , that is, villagers. Throughout the century that followed, villagers and other peasants proved to be the greatest opponents of Christianisation, while missionaries often received the support of the &quot; and other noblemen. Saint Lebuin, an Englishman who between 745 and 770 preached to the Saxons, mainly in the eastern Netherlands, built a church and made many friends among the nobility. Some of them rallied to save him from an angry mob at the annual council at Marklo (near river Weser, Bremen). Social tensions arose between the Christianity-sympathetic noblemen and the pagan lower castes, who were staunchly faithful to their traditional religion.

Under Charlemagne, the Saxon Wars had as their chief object the conversion and integration of the Saxons into the Frankish empire. Though much of the highest caste converted readily, forced baptisms and forced tithing made enemies of the lower orders. Even some contemporaries found the methods employed to win over the Saxons wanting, as this excerpt from a letter of Alcuin of York to his friend Meginfrid, written in 796, shows:

If the light yoke and sweet burden of Christ were to be preached to the most obstinate people of the Saxons with as much determination as the payment of tithes has been exacted, or as the force of the legal decree has been applied for fault of the most trifling sort imaginable, perhaps they would not be averse to their baptismal vows.
Charlemagne&#x27;s successor, Louis the Pious, reportedly treated the Saxons more as Alcuin would have wished, and as a consequence they were faithful subjects. The lower classes, however, revolted against Frankish overlordship in favour of their old paganism as late as the 840s, when the rose up against the Saxon leadership, who were allied with the Frankish emperor Lothair I. After the suppression of the &quot;, in 851 Louis the German brought relics from Rome to Saxony to foster a devotion to the Roman Catholic Church. The Poeta Saxo, in his verse of Charlemagne&#x27;s reign (written between 888 and 891), laid an emphasis on his conquest of Saxony. He celebrated the Frankish monarch as on par with the Roman emperors and as the bringer of Christian salvation to people. References are made to periodic outbreaks of pagan worship, especially of Freya, among the Saxon peasantry as late as the 12th century.

=====Christian literature=====
In the ninth century, the Saxon nobility became vigorous supporters of monasticism and formed a bulwark of Christianity against the existing Slavic paganism to the east and the Nordic paganism of the Vikings to the north. Much Christian literature was produced in the vernacular Old Saxon, the notable ones being a result of the literary output and wide influence of Saxon monasteries such as Fulda, Corvey and Verden; and the theological controversy between the Augustinian, Gottschalk and Rabanus Maurus.

From an early date, Charlemagne and Louis the Pious supported Christian vernacular works in order to evangelise the Saxons more efficiently. The &quot;Heliand&quot;, a verse epic of the life of Christ in a Germanic setting, and &quot;Genesis&quot;, another epic retelling of the events of the first book of the Bible, were commissioned in the early ninth century by Louis to disseminate scriptural knowledge to the masses. A council of Tours in 813 and then a synod of Mainz in 848 both declared that homilies ought to be preached in the vernacular. The earliest preserved text in the Saxon language is a baptismal vow from the late eighth or early ninth century; the vernacular was used extensively in an effort to Christianise the lowest castes of Saxon society.

==Saxon as a demonym==
===Celtic languages===
In the Celtic languages, the words designating English nationality derive from the Latin word . The most prominent example, a loanword in English from Scottish Gaelic (older spellings: , Sassanich or Sassenagh), is the word , originally used by Gaels for both the English and the Scots language speaking lowlanders of Scotland. In the 20th century, Scots–English and Gaelic-speakers came to use it as a disparaging term for an English person. The Gaelic name for England is (older spelling: , genitive: ), and (formed with a common adjective suffix ) means &#x27;English&#x27; in reference to people and things, though not when naming the English language, which is .&lt;br&gt;

, the Irish word for an Englishman (with meaning England), has the same derivation, as do the words used in Welsh to describe the English people (, singular ) and the language and things English in general: and .

Cornish terms the English , from the same derivation. In the 16th century Cornish-speakers used the phrase to feign ignorance of the English language. The Cornish words for the English people and England are and (&#x27;Land [Pays] of Saxons&#x27;). Similarly Breton, spoken in north-western France, has (&#x27;English&#x27;), (&#x27;the English language&#x27;), and for &#x27;England&#x27;.

===Romance languages===
The label &quot;Saxons&quot; (in ) also became attached to German settlers who settled during the 12th century in southeastern Transylvania.
From Transylvania, some of these Saxons migrated to neighbouring Moldavia, as the name of the town Sascut, in present-day Romania, shows.

===Non-Indo-European languages===
The Finns and Estonians have changed their usage of the root &quot;Saxon&quot; over the centuries to apply now to the whole country of Germany ( and respectively) and the Germans ( and , respectively). The Finnish word (scissors) reflects the name of the old Saxon single-edged sword – seax – from which the name &quot;Saxon&quot; supposedly derives. In Estonian, means colloquially, &#x27;a wealthy person&#x27;. As a result of the Northern Crusades, Estonia&#x27;s upper class comprised mostly Baltic Germans, persons of supposedly Saxon origin until well into the 20th century.

==Saxony as a later toponym==
Following the downfall of Henry the Lion (11291195, Duke of Saxony 11421180), and the subsequent splitting of the Saxon tribal duchy into several territories, the name of the Saxon duchy was transferred to the lands of the Ascanian family. This led to the differentiation between Lower Saxony (lands settled by the Saxon tribe) and Upper Saxony (the lands belonging to the House of Wettin). Gradually, the latter region became known as Saxony, ultimately usurping the name&#x27;s original geographical meaning. The area formerly known as Upper Saxony now lies in Central Germany – in the eastern part of the present-day Federal Republic of Germany: note the names of the federal states of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt.
