<text>Privacy (, ) is the ability of an individual or group to seclude themselves or information about themselves, and thereby express themselves selectively.

The domain of privacy partially overlaps with security, which can include the concepts of appropriate use and protection of information. Privacy may also take the form of bodily integrity.

Throughout history, there have been various conceptions of privacy. Most cultures acknowledge the right of individuals to keep aspects of their personal lives out of the public domain. The right to be free from unauthorized invasions of privacy by governments, corporations, or individuals is enshrined in the privacy laws of many countries and, in some instances, their constitutions.

With the rise of technology, the debate regarding privacy has expanded from a bodily sense to include a digital sense. In most countries, the right to digital privacy is considered an extension of the original right to privacy, and many countries have passed acts that further protect digital privacy from public and private entities.

There are multiple techniques to invade privacy, which may be employed by corporations or governments for profit or political reasons. Conversely, in order to protect privacy, people may employ encryption or anonymity measures.

==Etymology==
The word privacy is derived from the Latin word and concept of ‘&quot;privatus&quot;’, which referred to things set apart from what is public; personal and belonging to oneself, and not to the state. Literally, ‘&quot;privatus&quot;’ is the past participle of the Latin verb ‘&quot;privere&quot;’ meaning ‘to be deprived of’.

==History==


=== Philosophical views on privacy ===
The concept of privacy has been explored and discussed by numerous philosophers throughout history.

Privacy has historical roots in ancient Greek philosophical discussions. The most well-known of these was Aristotle&#x27;s distinction between two spheres of life: the public sphere of the &quot;polis&quot;, associated with political life, and the private sphere of the &quot;oikos&quot;, associated with domestic life. Privacy is valued along with other basic necessities of life in the Jewish deutero-canonical Book of Sirach.

Islam&#x27;s holy text, the Qur&#x27;an, states the following regarding privacy: ‘Do not spy on one another’ (49:12); ‘Do not enter any houses except your own homes unless you are sure of their occupants&#x27; consent’ (24:27).

English philosopher John Locke’s (1632-1704) writings on natural rights and the social contract laid the groundwork for modern conceptions of individual rights, including the right to privacy. In his &quot;Second Treatise of Civil Government&quot;(1689), Locke argued that a man is entitled to his own self through one’s natural rights of life, liberty, and property. He believed that the government was responsible for protecting these rights so individuals were guaranteed private spaces to practice personal activities.

In the political sphere, philosophers hold differing views on the right of private judgment. German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) makes the distinction between &quot;moralität&quot;, which refers to an individual’s private judgment, and &quot;sittlichkeit&quot;, pertaining to one’s rights and obligations as defined by an existing corporate order. On the contrary, Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832), an English philosopher, interpreted law as an invasion of privacy. His theory of utilitarianism argued that legal actions should be judged by the extent of their contribution to human wellbeing, or necessary utility.

Hegel’s notions were modified by prominent 19th century English philosopher John Stuart Mill. Mill’s essay &quot;On Liberty&quot; (1859) argued for the importance of protecting individual liberty against the tyranny of the majority and the interference of the state. His views emphasized the right of privacy as essential for personal development and self-expression.

Discussions surrounding surveillance coincided with philosophical ideas on privacy. Jeremy Bentham developed the phenomenon known as the Panoptic effect through his 1791 architectural design of a prison called Panopticon. The phenomenon explored the possibility of surveillance as a general awareness of being watched that could never be proven at any particular moment. French philosopher Michel Foucault (1926-1984) concluded that the possibility of surveillance in the instance of the Panopticon meant a prisoner had no choice but to conform to the prison&#x27;s rules.

===Technology===

As technology has advanced, the way in which privacy is protected and violated has changed with it. In the case of some technologies, such as the printing press or the Internet, the increased ability to share information can lead to new ways in which privacy can be breached. It is generally agreed that the first publication advocating privacy in the United States was the 1890 article by Samuel Warren and Louis Brandeis, &quot;The Right to Privacy&quot;, and that it was written mainly in response to the increase in newspapers and photographs made possible by printing technologies.

In 1948, &quot;1984,&quot; written by George Orwell, was published. A classic dystopian novel, &quot;1984&quot; describes the life of Winston Smith in 1984, located in Oceania, a totalitarian state. The all-controlling Party, the party in power led by Big Brother, is able to control power through mass surveillance and limited freedom of speech and thought. George Orwell provides commentary on the negative effects of totalitarianism, particularly on privacy and censorship. Parallels have been drawn between &quot;1984&quot; and modern censorship and privacy, a notable example being that large social media companies, rather than the government, are able to monitor a user&#x27;s data and decide what is allowed to be said online through their censorship policies, ultimately for monetary purposes.

In the 1960s, people began to consider how changes in technology were bringing changes in the concept of privacy. Vance Packard&#x27;s &quot;The Naked Society&quot; was a popular book on privacy from that era and led US discourse on privacy at that time. In addition, Alan Westin&#x27;s &quot;Privacy and Freedom&quot; shifted the debate regarding privacy from a physical sense, how the government controls a person&#x27;s body (i.e. &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;) and other activities such as wiretapping and photography. As important records became digitized, Westin argued that personal data was becoming too accessible and that a person should have complete jurisdiction over their data, laying the foundation for the modern discussion of privacy.

New technologies can also create new ways to gather private information. In 2001, the legal case &quot;Kyllo v. United States&quot; (533 U.S. 27) determined that the use of thermal imaging devices that can reveal previously unknown information without a warrant constitutes a violation of privacy. In 2019, after developing a corporate rivalry in competing voice-recognition software, Apple and Amazon required employees to listen to intimate moments and faithfully transcribe the contents.

====Police and government====


Police and citizens often conflict on what degree the police can intrude a citizen&#x27;s digital privacy. For instance, in 2012, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in &quot;United States v. Jones&quot; (565 U.S. 400), in the case of Antoine Jones who was arrested of drug possession using a GPS tracker on his car that was placed without a warrant, that warrantless tracking infringes the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court also justified that there is some &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; in transportation since the reasonable expectation of privacy had already been established under &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; (1965). The Supreme Court also further clarified that the Fourth Amendment did not only pertain to physical instances of intrusion but also digital instances, and thus &quot;United States v. Jones&quot; became a landmark case.

In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously in &quot;Riley v. California&quot; (573 U.S. 373), where David Leon Riley was arrested after he was pulled over for driving on expired license tags when the police searched his phone and discovered that he was tied to a shooting, that searching a citizen&#x27;s phone without a warrant was an unreasonable search, a violation of the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court concluded that the cell phones contained personal information different from trivial items, and went beyond to state that information stored on the cloud was not necessarily a form of evidence. &quot;Riley v. California&quot; evidently became a landmark case, protecting the digital protection of citizen&#x27;s privacy when confronted with the police.

A recent notable occurrence of the conflict between law enforcement and a citizen in terms of digital privacy has been in the 2018 case, &quot;Carpenter v. United States&quot; (585 U.S. ____). In this case, the FBI used cell phone records without a warrant to arrest Timothy Ivory Carpenter on multiple charges, and the Supreme Court ruled that the warrantless search of cell phone records violated the Fourth Amendment, citing that the Fourth Amendment protects &quot;reasonable expectations of privacy&quot; and that information sent to third parties still falls under data that can be included under &quot;reasonable expectations of privacy&quot;.

Beyond law enforcement, many interactions between the government and citizens have been revealed either lawfully or unlawfully, specifically through whistleblowers. One notable example is Edward Snowden, who released multiple operations related to the mass surveillance operations of the National Security Agency (NSA), where it was discovered that the NSA continues to breach the security of millions of people, mainly through mass surveillance programs whether it was collecting great amounts of data through third party private companies, hacking into other embassies or frameworks of international countries, and various breaches of data, which prompted a culture shock and stirred international debate related to digital privacy.

==Internet==

The Internet and technologies built on it enable new forms of social interactions at increasingly faster speeds and larger scales. Because the computer networks which underlie the Internet introduce such a wide range of novel security concerns, the discussion of &quot;privacy&quot; on the Internet is often conflated with &quot;security&quot;. Indeed, many entities such as corporations involved in the surveillance economy inculcate a security-focused conceptualization of privacy which reduces their obligations to uphold privacy into a matter of regulatory compliance, while at the same time lobbying to minimize those regulatory requirements.

The Internet&#x27;s effect on privacy includes all of the ways that computational technology and the entities that control it can subvert the privacy expectations of their users. In particular, the right to be forgotten is motivated by both the &quot;computational ability&quot; to store and search through massive amounts of data as well as the &quot;subverted expectations&quot; of users who share information online without expecting it to be stored and retained indefinitely. Phenomena such as revenge porn and deepfakes are not merely individual because they require both the ability to obtain images without someone&#x27;s consent as well as the social and economic infrastructure to disseminate that content widely. Therefore, privacy advocacy groups such as the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative and the Electronic Frontier Foundation argue that addressing the new privacy harms introduced by the Internet requires both technological improvements to encryption and anonymity as well as societal efforts such as legal regulations to restrict corporate and government power.

While the Internet began as a government and academic effort up through the 1980s, private corporations began to enclose the hardware and software of the Internet in the 1990s, and now most Internet infrastructure is owned and managed by for-profit corporations. As a result, the ability of governments to protect their citizens&#x27; privacy is largely restricted to industrial policy, instituting controls on corporations that handle communications or personal data. Privacy regulations are often further constrained to only protect specific demographics such as children, or specific industries such as credit card bureaus.

===Social networking===
Several online social network sites (OSNs) are among the top 10 most visited websites globally. Facebook for example, as of August 2015, was the largest social-networking site, with nearly 2.7 billion members, who upload over 4.75 billion pieces of content daily. While Twitter is significantly smaller with 316 million registered users, the US Library of Congress recently announced that it will be acquiring and permanently storing the entire archive of public Twitter posts since 2006.

A review and evaluation of scholarly work regarding the current state of the value of individuals&#x27; privacy of online social networking show the following results: &quot;first, adults seem to be more concerned about potential privacy threats than younger users; second, policy makers should be alarmed by a large part of users who underestimate risks of their information privacy on OSNs; third, in the case of using OSNs and its services, traditional one-dimensional privacy approaches fall short&quot;. This is exacerbated by deanonymization research indicating that personal traits such as sexual orientation, race, religious and political views, personality, or intelligence can be inferred based on a wide variety of digital footprints, such as samples of text, browsing logs, or Facebook Likes.

Intrusions of social media privacy are known to affect employment in the United States. Microsoft reports that 75 percent of U.S. recruiters and human-resource professionals now do online research about candidates, often using information provided by search engines, social-networking sites, photo/video-sharing sites, personal web sites and blogs, and Twitter. They also report that 70 percent of U.S. recruiters have rejected candidates based on internet information. This has created a need by many candidates to control various online privacy settings in addition to controlling their online reputations, the conjunction of which has led to legal suits against both social media sites and US employers.

====Selfie culture====
Selfies are popular today. A search for photos with the hashtag #selfie retrieves over 23 million results on Instagram and 51 million with the hashtag #me. However, due to modern corporate and governmental surveillance, this may pose a risk to privacy. In a research study which takes a sample size of 3763, researchers found that for users posting selfies on social media, women generally have greater concerns over privacy than men, and that users&#x27; privacy concerns inversely predict their selfie behavior and activity.

====Online harassment====

An invasion of someone&#x27;s privacy may be widely and quickly disseminated over the Internet. When social media sites and other online communities fail to invest in content moderation, an invasion of privacy can expose people to a much greater volume and degree of harassment than would otherwise be possible. Revenge porn may lead to misogynist or homophobic harassment, such as in the suicide of Amanda Todd and the suicide of Tyler Clementi. When someone&#x27;s physical location or other sensitive information is leaked over the Internet via doxxing, harassment may escalate to direct physical harm such as stalking or swatting.

Despite the way breaches of privacy can magnify online harassment, online harassment is often used as a justification to curtail freedom of speech, by removing the expectation of privacy via anonymity, or by enabling law enforcement to invade privacy without a search warrant. In the wake of Amanda Todd&#x27;s death, the Canadian parliament proposed a motion purporting to stop bullying, but Todd&#x27;s mother herself gave testimony to parliament rejecting the bill due to its provisions for warrantless breaches of privacy, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t want to see our children victimized again by losing privacy rights.&quot;

Even where these laws have been passed despite privacy concerns, they have not demonstrated a reduction in online harassment. When the Korea Communications Commission introduced a registration system for online commenters in 2007, they reported that malicious comments only decreased by 0.9%, and in 2011 it was repealed. A subsequent analysis found that the set of users who posted the most comments actually increased the number of &quot;aggressive expressions&quot; when forced to use their real name.

In the US, while federal law only prohibits online harassment based on protected characteristics such as gender and race, individual states have expanded the definition of harassment to further curtail speech: Florida&#x27;s definition of online harassment includes &quot;any use of data or computer software&quot; that &quot;Has the effect of substantially disrupting the orderly operation of a school.&quot;

===Privacy and location-based services===
Increasingly, mobile devices facilitate location tracking. This creates user privacy problems. A user&#x27;s location and preferences constitute personal information, and their improper use violates that user&#x27;s privacy. A recent MIT study by de Montjoye et al. showed that four spatio-temporal points constituting approximate places and times are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5M people in a mobility database. The study further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets confer little privacy protection.

Several methods to protect user privacy in location-based services have been proposed, including the use of anonymizing servers and blurring of information. Methods to quantify privacy have also been proposed, to calculate the equilibrium between the benefit of obtaining accurate location information and the risks of breaching an individual&#x27;s privacy.

====Ethical controversies over location privacy====
There have been scandals regarding location privacy. One instance was the scandal concerning AccuWeather, where it was revealed that AccuWeather was selling locational data. This consisted of a user&#x27;s locational data, even if they opted out within Accuweather, which tracked users&#x27; location. Accuweather sold this data to Reveal Mobile, a company that monetizes data related to a user&#x27;s location. Other international cases are similar to the Accuweather case. In 2017, a leaky API inside the McDelivery App exposed private data, which consisted of home addresses, of 2.2 million users.

In the wake of these types of scandals, many large American technology companies such as Google, Apple, and Facebook have been subjected to hearings and pressure under the U.S. legislative system. In 2011, US Senator Al Franken wrote an open letter to Steve Jobs, noting the ability of iPhones and iPads to record and store users&#x27; locations in unencrypted files. Apple claimed this was an unintentional software bug, but Justin Brookman of the Center for Democracy and Technology directly challenged that portrayal, stating &quot;I&#x27;m glad that they are fixing what they call bugs, but I take exception with their strong denial that they track users.&quot; In 2021, the U.S. state of Arizona found in a court case that Google misled its users and stored the location of users regardless of their location settings.

===Advertising===


The Internet has become a significant medium for advertising, with digital marketing making up approximately half of the global ad spending in 2019. While websites are still able to sell advertising space without tracking, including via contextual advertising, digital ad brokers such as Facebook and Google have instead encouraged the practice of behavioral advertising, providing code snippets used by website owners to track their users via HTTP cookies. This tracking data is also sold to other third parties as part of the mass surveillance industry. Since the introduction of mobile phones, data brokers have also been planted within apps, resulting in a $350 billion digital industry especially focused on mobile devices.

Digital privacy has become the main source of concern for many mobile users, especially with the rise of privacy scandals such as the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Apple has received some reactions for features that prohibit advertisers from tracking a user&#x27;s data without their consent. Google attempted to introduce an alternative to cookies named FLoC which it claimed reduced the privacy harms, but it later retracted the proposal due to antitrust probes and analyses that contradicted their claims of privacy.

===Metadata===

The ability to do online inquiries about individuals has expanded dramatically over the last decade. Importantly, directly observed behavior, such as browsing logs, search queries, or contents of a public Facebook profile, can be automatically processed to infer secondary information about an individual, such as sexual orientation, political and religious views, race, substance use, intelligence, and personality.

In Australia, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Act 2015 made a distinction between collecting the contents of messages sent between users and the metadata surrounding those messages.

==Legal right to privacy==


Most countries give citizens rights to privacy in their constitutions. Representative examples of this include the Constitution of Brazil, which says &quot;the privacy, private life, honor and image of people are inviolable&quot;; the Constitution of South Africa says that &quot;everyone has a right to privacy&quot;; and the Constitution of the Republic of Korea says &quot;the privacy of no citizen shall be infringed.&quot; The Italian Constitution also defines the right to privacy. Among most countries whose constitutions do not explicitly describe privacy rights, court decisions have interpreted their constitutions to intend to give privacy rights.
Many countries have broad privacy laws outside their constitutions, including Australia&#x27;s Privacy Act 1988, Argentina&#x27;s Law for the Protection of Personal Data of 2000, Canada&#x27;s 2000 Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, and Japan&#x27;s 2003 Personal Information Protection Law.

Beyond national privacy laws, there are international privacy agreements. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights says &quot;No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with [their] privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon [their] honor and reputation.&quot; The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development published its Privacy Guidelines in 1980. The European Union&#x27;s 1995 Data Protection Directive guides privacy protection in Europe. The 2004 Privacy Framework by the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation is a privacy protection agreement for the members of that organization.

===Free market vs consumer protection===
Approaches to privacy can, broadly, be divided into two categories: free market or consumer protection.

One example of the free market approach is to be found in the voluntary OECD Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder Flows of Personal Data. The principles reflected in the guidelines, free of legislative interference, are analyzed in an article putting them into perspective with concepts of the GDPR put into law later in the European Union.

In a consumer protection approach, in contrast, it is claimed that individuals may not have the time or knowledge to make informed choices, or may not have reasonable alternatives available. In support of this view, Jensen and Potts showed that most privacy policies are above the reading level of the average person.

===By country===
====Australia====
The &quot;Privacy Act 1988&quot; is administered by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. The initial introduction of privacy law in 1998 extended to the public sector, specifically to Federal government departments, under the Information Privacy Principles. State government agencies can also be subject to state based privacy legislation. This built upon the already existing privacy requirements that applied to telecommunications providers (under Part 13 of the &quot;Telecommunications Act 1997&quot;), and confidentiality requirements that already applied to banking, legal and patient / doctor relationships.

In 2008 the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) conducted a review of Australian privacy law and produced a report titled &quot;For Your Information&quot;. Recommendations were taken up and implemented by the Australian Government via the Privacy Amendment (Enhancing Privacy Protection) Bill 2012.

In 2015, the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Amendment (Data Retention) Act 2015 was passed, to some controversy over its human rights implications and the role of media.

==== Canada ====

Canada is a federal state whose provinces and territories abide by the common law save the province of Quebec whose legal tradition is the civil law. Privacy in Canada was first addressed through the &quot;Privacy Act&quot;, a 1985 piece of legislation applicable to personal information held by government institutions. The provinces and territories would later follow suit with their own legislation. Generally, the purposes of said legislation are to provide individuals rights to access personal information; to have inaccurate personal information corrected; and to prevent unauthorized collection, use, and disclosure of personal information. In terms of regulating personal information in the private sector, the federal &quot;Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act&quot; (&quot;PIPEDA&quot;) is enforceable in all jurisdictions unless a substantially similar provision has been enacted on the provincial level. However, inter-provincial or international information transfers still engage PIPEDA. PIPEDA has gone through two law overhaul efforts in 2021 and 2023 with the involvement of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and Canadian academics. In the absence of a statutory private right of action absent an OPC investigation, the common law torts of intrusion upon seclusion and public disclosure of private facts, as well as the Civil Code of Quebec may be brought for an infringement or violation of privacy. Privacy is also protected under ss. 7 and 8 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; which is typically applied in the criminal law context. In Quebec, individuals&#x27; privacy is safeguarded by articles 3 and 35 to 41 of the Civil Code of Quebec as well as by s. 5 of the Charter of human rights and freedoms.

====European Union====
In 2016, the European Union passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which was intended to reduce the misuse of personal data and enhance individual privacy, by requiring companies to receive consent before acquiring personal information from users.

Although there are comprehensive regulations for data protection in the European Union, one study finds that despite the laws, there is a lack of enforcement in that no institution feels responsible to control the parties involved and enforce their laws. The European Union also champions the Right to be Forgotten concept in support of its adoption by other countries.

====India====
Since the introduction of the Aadhaar project in 2009, which resulted in all 1.2 billion Indians being associated with a 12-digit biometric-secured number. Aadhaar has uplifted the poor in India by providing them with a form of identity and preventing the fraud and waste of resources, as normally the government would not be able to allocate its resources to its intended assignees due to the ID issues. With the rise of Aadhaar, India has debated whether Aadhaar violates an individual&#x27;s privacy and whether any organization should have access to an individual&#x27;s digital profile, as the Aadhaar card became associated with other economic sectors, allowing for the tracking of individuals by both public and private bodies. Aadhaar databases have suffered from security attacks as well and the project was also met with mistrust regarding the safety of the social protection infrastructures. In 2017, where the Aadhar was challenged, the Indian Supreme Court declared privacy as a human right, but postponed the decision regarding the constitutionality of Aadhaar for another bench. In September 2018, the Indian Supreme Court determined that the Aadhaar project did not violate the legal right to privacy.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, it is not possible to bring an action for invasion of privacy. An action may be brought under another tort (usually breach of confidence) and privacy must then be considered under EC law. In the UK, it is sometimes a defence that disclosure of private information was in the public interest. There is, however, the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office (ICO), an independent public body set up to promote access to official information and protect personal information. They do this by promoting good practice, ruling on eligible complaints, giving information to individuals and organisations, and taking action when the law is broken. The relevant UK laws include: Data Protection Act 1998; Freedom of Information Act 2000; Environmental Information Regulations 2004; Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003. The ICO has also provided a &quot;Personal Information Toolkit&quot; online which explains in more detail the various ways of protecting privacy online.

====United States====
In the United States, more systematic treatises of privacy did not appear until the 1890s, with the development of privacy law in America. Although the US Constitution does not explicitly include the right to privacy, individual as well as locational privacy may be implicitly granted by the Constitution under the 4th Amendment. The Supreme Court of the United States has found that other guarantees have &quot;penumbras&quot; that implicitly grant a right to privacy against government intrusion, for example in &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot; and &quot;Roe v. Wade.&quot; &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; later overruled &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas characterizing &quot;Griswold&quot;&#x27;s penumbral argument as having a &quot;facial absurdity&quot;, casting doubt on the validity of a constitutional right to privacy in the United States and of previous decisions relying on it. In the United States, the right of freedom of speech granted in the First Amendment has limited the effects of lawsuits for breach of privacy. Privacy is regulated in the US by the Privacy Act of 1974, and various state laws. The Privacy Act of 1974 only applies to federal agencies in the executive branch of the federal government. Certain privacy rights have been established in the United States via legislation such as the Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLB), and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
Unlike the EU and most EU-member states, the US does not recognize the right to privacy of non-US citizens. The UN&#x27;s Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy, Joseph A. Cannataci, criticized this distinction.

==Conceptions of privacy==

===Privacy as contextual integrity===
The theory of contextual integrity, developed by Helen Nissenbaum, defines privacy as an appropriate information flow, where appropriateness, in turn, is defined as conformance with legitimate, informational norms specific to social contexts.

===Right to be let alone===
In 1890, the United States jurists Samuel D. Warren and Louis Brandeis wrote &quot;The Right to Privacy&quot;, an article in which they argued for the &quot;right to be let alone&quot;, using that phrase as a definition of privacy. This concept relies on the theory of natural rights and focuses on protecting individuals. The citation was a response to recent technological developments, such as photography, and sensationalist journalism, also known as yellow journalism.

There is extensive commentary over the meaning of being &quot;let alone&quot;, and among other ways, it has been interpreted to mean the right of a person to choose seclusion from the attention of others if they wish to do so, and the right to be immune from scrutiny or being observed in private settings, such as one&#x27;s own home. Although this early vague legal concept did not describe privacy in a way that made it easy to design broad legal protections of privacy, it strengthened the notion of privacy rights for individuals and began a legacy of discussion on those rights in the US.

===Limited access===
Limited access refers to a person&#x27;s ability to participate in society without having other individuals and organizations collect information about them.

Various theorists have imagined privacy as a system for limiting access to one&#x27;s personal information. Edwin Lawrence Godkin wrote in the late 19th century that &quot;nothing is better worthy of legal protection than private life, or, in other words, the right of every man to keep his affairs to himself, and to decide for himself to what extent they shall be the subject of public observation and discussion.&quot; Adopting an approach similar to the one presented by Ruth Gavison Nine years earlier, Sissela Bok said that privacy is &quot;the condition of being protected from unwanted access by others—either physical access, personal information, or attention.&quot;

===Control over information===
Control over one&#x27;s personal information is the concept that &quot;privacy is the claim of individuals, groups, or institutions to determine for themselves when, how, and to what extent information about them is communicated to others.&quot; Generally, a person who has consensually formed an interpersonal relationship with another person is not considered &quot;protected&quot; by privacy rights with respect to the person they are in the relationship with. Charles Fried said that &quot;Privacy is not simply an absence of information about us in the minds of others; rather it is the control we have over information about ourselves. Nevertheless, in the era of big data, control over information is under pressure.

=== States of privacy ===
Alan Westin defined four states—or experiences—of privacy: solitude, intimacy, anonymity, and reserve. Solitude is a physical separation from others; Intimacy is a &quot;close, relaxed; and frank relationship between two or more individuals&quot; that results from the seclusion of a pair or small group of individuals. Anonymity is the &quot;desire of individuals for times of &#x27;public privacy.&#x27;&quot; Lastly, reserve is the &quot;creation of a psychological barrier against unwanted intrusion&quot;; this creation of a psychological barrier requires others to respect an individual&#x27;s need or desire to restrict communication of information concerning themself.

In addition to the psychological barrier of reserve, Kirsty Hughes identified three more kinds of privacy barriers: physical, behavioral, and normative. Physical barriers, such as walls and doors, prevent others from accessing and experiencing the individual. (In this sense, &quot;accessing&quot; an individual includes accessing personal information about them.) Behavioral barriers communicate to others—verbally, through language, or non-verbally, through personal space, body language, or clothing—that an individual does not want the other person to access or experience them. Lastly, normative barriers, such as laws and social norms, restrain others from attempting to access or experience an individual.

=== Privacy as personal control ===
Psychologist Carl A. Johnson has identified the psychological concept of “personal control” as closely tied to privacy. His concept was developed as a process containing four stages and two behavioural outcome relationships, with one’s outcomes depending on situational as well as personal factors. Privacy is described as “behaviors falling at specific locations on these two dimensions”.

Johnson examined the following four stages to categorize where people exercise personal control: outcome choice control is the selection between various outcomes. Behaviour selection control is the selection between behavioural strategies to apply to attain selected outcomes. Outcome effectance describes the fulfillment of selected behaviour to achieve chosen outcomes. Outcome realization control is the personal interpretation of one’s achieved outcome. The relationship between two factors– primary and secondary control, is defined as the two-dimensional phenomenon where one reaches personal control: primary control describes behaviour directly causing outcomes, while secondary control is behaviour indirectly causing outcomes. Johnson explores the concept that privacy is a behaviour that has secondary control over outcomes.

Lorenzo Magnani expands on this concept by highlighting how privacy is essential in maintaining personal control over one&#x27;s identity and consciousness. He argues that consciousness is partly formed by external representations of ourselves, such as narratives and data, which are stored outside the body. However, much of our consciousness consists of internal representations that remain private and are rarely externalized. This internal privacy, which Magnani refers to as a form of &quot;information property&quot; or &quot;moral capital,&quot; is crucial for preserving free choice and personal agency. According to Magnani, when too much of our identity and data is externalized and subjected to scrutiny, it can lead to a loss of personal control, dignity, and responsibility. The protection of privacy, therefore, safeguards our ability to develop and pursue personal projects in our own way, free from intrusive external forces. 

Acknowledging other conceptions of privacy while arguing that the fundamental concern of privacy is behavior selection control, Johnson converses with other interpretations including those of Maxine Wolfe and Robert S. Laufer, and Irwin Altman. He clarifies the continuous relationship between privacy and personal control, where outlined behaviours not only depend on privacy, but the conception of one’s privacy also depends on his defined behavioural outcome relationships.

===Secrecy===
Privacy is sometimes defined as an option to have secrecy. Richard Posner said that privacy is the right of people to &quot;conceal information about themselves that others might use to their disadvantage&quot;.

In various legal contexts, when privacy is described as secrecy, a conclusion is reached: if privacy is secrecy, then rights to privacy do not apply for any information which is already publicly disclosed. When privacy-as-secrecy is discussed, it is usually imagined to be a selective kind of secrecy in which individuals keep some information secret and private while they choose to make other information public and not private.

===Personhood and autonomy===
Privacy may be understood as a necessary precondition for the development and preservation of personhood. Jeffrey Reiman defined privacy in terms of a recognition of one&#x27;s ownership of their physical and mental reality and a moral right to self-determination. Through the &quot;social ritual&quot; of privacy, or the social practice of respecting an individual&#x27;s privacy barriers, the social group communicates to developing children that they have exclusive moral rights to their bodies—in other words, moral ownership of their body. This entails control over both active (physical) and cognitive appropriation, the former being control over one&#x27;s movements and actions and the latter being control over who can experience one&#x27;s physical existence and when.

Alternatively, Stanley Benn defined privacy in terms of a recognition of oneself as a subject with agency—as an individual with the capacity to choose. Privacy is required to exercise choice. Overt observation makes the individual aware of himself or herself as an object with a &quot;determinate character&quot; and &quot;limited probabilities.&quot; Covert observation, on the other hand, changes the conditions in which the individual is exercising choice without his or her knowledge and consent.

In addition, privacy may be viewed as a state that enables autonomy, a concept closely connected to that of personhood. According to Joseph Kufer, an autonomous self-concept entails a conception of oneself as a &quot;purposeful, self-determining, responsible agent&quot; and an awareness of one&#x27;s capacity to control the boundary between self and other—that is, to control who can access and experience him or her and to what extent. Furthermore, others must acknowledge and respect the self&#x27;s boundaries—in other words, they must respect the individual&#x27;s privacy.

The studies of psychologists such as Jean Piaget and Victor Tausk show that, as children learn that they can control who can access and experience them and to what extent, they develop an autonomous self-concept. In addition, studies of adults in particular institutions, such as Erving Goffman&#x27;s study of &quot;total institutions&quot; such as prisons and mental institutions, suggest that systemic and routinized deprivations or violations of privacy deteriorate one&#x27;s sense of autonomy over time.

=== Self-identity and personal growth ===
Privacy may be understood as a prerequisite for the development of a sense of self-identity. Privacy barriers, in particular, are instrumental in this process. According to Irwin Altman, such barriers &quot;define and limit the boundaries of the self&quot; and thus &quot;serve to help define [the self].&quot; This control primarily entails the ability to regulate contact with others. Control over the &quot;permeability&quot; of the self&#x27;s boundaries enables one to control what constitutes the self and thus to define what is the self.

In addition, privacy may be seen as a state that fosters personal growth, a process integral to the development of self-identity. Hyman Gross suggested that, without privacy—solitude, anonymity, and temporary releases from social roles—individuals would be unable to freely express themselves and to engage in self-discovery and self-criticism. Such self-discovery and self-criticism contributes to one&#x27;s understanding of oneself and shapes one&#x27;s sense of identity.

===Intimacy===
In a way analogous to how the personhood theory imagines privacy as some essential part of being an individual, the intimacy theory imagines privacy to be an essential part of the way that humans have strengthened or intimate relationships with other humans. Because part of human relationships includes individuals volunteering to self-disclose most if not all personal information, this is one area in which privacy does not apply.

James Rachels advanced this notion by writing that privacy matters because &quot;there is a close connection between our ability to control who has access to us and to information about us, and our ability to create and maintain different sorts of social relationships with different people.&quot; Protecting intimacy is at the core of the concept of sexual privacy, which law professor Danielle Citron argues should be protected as a unique form of privacy.

===Physical privacy===
Physical privacy could be defined as preventing &quot;intrusions into one&#x27;s physical space or solitude.&quot; An example of the legal basis for the right to physical privacy is the U.S. Fourth Amendment, which guarantees &quot;the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures&quot;.

Physical privacy may be a matter of cultural sensitivity, personal dignity, and/or shyness. There may also be concerns about safety, if, for example one is wary of becoming the victim of crime or stalking. There are different things that can be prevented to protect one&#x27;s physical privacy, including people watching (even through recorded images) one&#x27;s intimate behaviours or intimate parts and unauthorized access to one&#x27;s personal possessions or places. Examples of possible efforts used to avoid the former, especially for modesty reasons, are clothes, walls, fences, privacy screens, cathedral glass, window coverings, etc.

===Organizational===
Government agencies, corporations, groups/societies and other organizations may desire to keep their activities or secrets from being revealed to other organizations or individuals, adopting various security practices and controls in order to keep private information confidential. Organizations may seek legal protection for their secrets. For example, a government administration may be able to invoke executive privilege or declare certain information to be classified, or a corporation might attempt to protect valuable proprietary information as trade secrets.

====Privacy self-synchronization====
Privacy self-synchronization is a hypothesized mode by which the stakeholders of an enterprise privacy program spontaneously contribute collaboratively to the program&#x27;s maximum success. The stakeholders may be customers, employees, managers, executives, suppliers, partners or investors. When self-synchronization is reached, the model states that the personal interests of individuals toward their privacy is in balance with the business interests of enterprises who collect and use the personal information of those individuals.

===An individual right===
David Flaherty believes networked computer databases pose threats to privacy. He develops &#x27;data protection&#x27; as an aspect of privacy, which involves &quot;the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information&quot;. This concept forms the foundation for fair information practices used by governments globally. Flaherty forwards an idea of privacy as information control, &quot;[i]ndividuals want to be left alone and to exercise some control over how information about them is used&quot;.

Richard Posner and Lawrence Lessig focus on the economic aspects of personal information control. Posner criticizes privacy for concealing information, which reduces market efficiency. For Posner, employment is selling oneself in the labour market, which he believes is like selling a product. Any &#x27;defect&#x27; in the &#x27;product&#x27; that is not reported is fraud. For Lessig, privacy breaches online can be regulated through code and law. Lessig claims &quot;the protection of privacy would be stronger if people conceived of the right as a property right&quot;, and that &quot;individuals should be able to control information about themselves&quot;.

===A collective value and a human right===
There have been attempts to establish privacy as one of the fundamental human rights, whose social value is an essential component in the functioning of democratic societies.

Priscilla Regan believes that individual concepts of privacy have failed philosophically and in policy. She supports a social value of privacy with three dimensions: shared perceptions, public values, and collective components. Shared ideas about privacy allows freedom of conscience and diversity in thought. Public values guarantee democratic participation, including freedoms of speech and association, and limits government power. Collective elements describe privacy as collective good that cannot be divided. Regan&#x27;s goal is to strengthen privacy claims in policy making: &quot;if we did recognize the collective or public-good value of privacy, as well as the common and public value of privacy, those advocating privacy protections would have a stronger basis upon which to argue for its protection&quot;.

Leslie Regan Shade argues that the human right to privacy is necessary for meaningful democratic participation, and ensures human dignity and autonomy. Privacy depends on norms for how information is distributed, and if this is appropriate. Violations of privacy depend on context. The human right to privacy has precedent in the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights: &quot;Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.&quot; Shade believes that privacy must be approached from a people-centered perspective, and not through the marketplace.

Dr. Eliza Watt, Westminster Law School, University of Westminster in London, UK, proposes application of the International Human Right Law (IHRL) concept of “virtual control” as an approach to deal with extraterritorial mass surveillance by state intelligence agencies. Dr. Watt envisions the “virtual control” test, understood as a remote control over the individual&#x27;s right to privacy of communications, where privacy is recognized under the ICCPR, Article 17. This, she contends, may help to close the normative gap that is being exploited by nation states.

===Privacy paradox and economic valuation===
The &quot;privacy paradox&quot; is a phenomenon in which online users state that they are concerned about their privacy but behave as if they were not. While this term was coined as early as 1998, it was not used in its current popular sense until the year 2000.

Susan B. Barnes similarly used the term &quot;privacy paradox&quot; to refer to the ambiguous boundary between private and public space on social media. When compared to adults, young people tend to disclose more information on social media. However, this does not mean that they are not concerned about their privacy. Susan B. Barnes gave a case in her article: in a television interview about Facebook, a student addressed her concerns about disclosing personal information online. However, when the reporter asked to see her Facebook page, she put her home address, phone numbers, and pictures of her young son on the page.

The privacy paradox has been studied and scripted in different research settings. Several studies have shown this inconsistency between privacy attitudes and behavior among online users. However, by now an increasing number of studies have also shown that there are significant and at times large correlations between privacy concerns and information sharing behavior, which speaks against the privacy paradox. A meta-analysis of 166 studies published on the topic reported an overall small but significant relation between privacy concerns and informations sharing or use of privacy protection measures. So although there are several individual instances or anecdotes where behavior appear paradoxical, on average privacy concerns and privacy behaviors seem to be related, and several findings question the general existence of the privacy paradox.

However, the relationship between concerns and behavior is likely only small, and there are several arguments that can explain why that is the case. According to the attitude-behavior gap, attitudes and behaviors are &quot;in general&quot; and in most cases not closely related. A main explanation for the partial mismatch in the context of privacy specifically is that users lack awareness of the risks and the degree of protection. Users may underestimate the harm of disclosing information online. On the other hand, some researchers argue that the mismatch comes from lack of technology literacy and from the design of sites. For example, users may not know how to change their default settings even though they care about their privacy. Psychologists Sonja Utz and Nicole C. Krämer particularly pointed out that the privacy paradox can occur when users must trade-off between their privacy concerns and impression management.

====Research on irrational decision making====
A study conducted by Susanne Barth and Menno D.T. de Jo demonstrates that decision making takes place on an irrational level, especially when it comes to mobile computing. Mobile applications in particular are often built up in such a way that spurs decision making that is fast and automatic without assessing risk factors. Protection measures against these unconscious mechanisms are often difficult to access while downloading and installing apps. Even with mechanisms in place to protect user privacy, users may not have the knowledge or experience to enable these mechanisms.

Users of mobile applications generally have very little knowledge of how their personal data are used. When they decide which application to download, they typically are not able to effectively interpret the information provided by application vendors regarding the collection and use of personal data. Other research finds that this lack of interpretability means users are much more likely to be swayed by cost, functionality, design, ratings, reviews and number of downloads than requested permissions for usage of their personal data.

====The economic valuation of privacy====
The willingness to incur a privacy risk is suspected to be driven by a complex array of factors including risk attitudes, personal value for private information, and general attitudes to privacy (which are typically measured using surveys). One experiment aiming to determine the monetary value of several types of personal information indicated relatively low evaluations of personal information. Despite claims that ascertaining the value of data requires a &quot;stock-market for personal information&quot;, surveillance capitalism and the mass surveillance industry regularly place price tags on this form of data as it is shared between corporations and governments.

=====Information asymmetry=====
Users are not always given the tools to live up to their professed privacy concerns, and they are sometimes willing to trade private information for convenience, functionality, or financial gain, even when the gains are very small. One study suggests that people think their browser history is worth the equivalent of a cheap meal. Another finds that attitudes to privacy risk do not appear to depend on whether it is already under threat or not. The methodology of user empowerment describes how to provide users with sufficient context to make privacy-informed decisions.

======Inherent necessity for privacy violation======
It is suggested by Andréa Belliger and David J. Krieger that the privacy paradox should not be considered a paradox, but more of a &quot;privacy dilemma&quot;, for services that cannot exist without the user sharing private data. However, the general public is typically not given the choice whether to share private data or not, making it difficult to verify any claim that a service truly cannot exist without sharing private data.

====== Privacy calculus model======
The privacy calculus model posits that two factors determine privacy behavior, namely privacy concerns (or perceived risks) and expected benefits. By now, the privacy calculus has been supported by several studies.

==Actions which reduce privacy==
As with other conceptions of privacy, there are various ways to discuss what kinds of processes or actions remove, challenge, lessen, or attack privacy. In 1960 legal scholar William Prosser created the following list of activities which can be remedied with privacy protection:

# Intrusion into a person&#x27;s private space, own affairs, or wish for solitude
# Public disclosure of personal information about a person which could be embarrassing for them to have revealed
# Promoting access to information about a person which could lead the public to have incorrect beliefs about them
# Encroaching someone&#x27;s personality rights, and using their likeness to advance interests which are not their own

From 2004 to 2008, building from this and other historical precedents, Daniel J. Solove presented another classification of actions which are harmful to privacy, including collection of information which is already somewhat public, processing of information, sharing information, and invading personal space to get private information.

===Collecting information===
In the context of harming privacy, information collection means gathering whatever information can be obtained by doing something to obtain it. Examples include surveillance and interrogation. Another example is how consumers and marketers also collect information in the business context through facial recognition which has recently caused a concern for things such as privacy. There is currently research being done related to this topic.

Companies like Google and Meta collect vast amounts of personal data from their users through various services and platforms. This data includes browsing habits, search history, location information, and even personal communications. These companies then analyze and aggregate this data to create detailed user profiles, which are sold to advertisers and other third parties. This practice is often done without explicit user consent, leading to an invasion of privacy as individuals have little control over how their information is used. The sale of personal data can result in targeted advertising, manipulation, and even potential security risks, as sensitive information can be exploited by malicious actors. This commercial exploitation of personal data undermines user trust and raises significant ethical and legal concerns regarding data protection and privacy rights. 

===Aggregating information===
It can happen that privacy is not harmed when information is available, but that the harm can come when that information is collected as a set, then processed together in such a way that the collective reporting of pieces of information encroaches on privacy. Actions in this category which can lessen privacy include the following:

* data aggregation, which is connecting many related but unconnected pieces of information
* identification, which can mean breaking the de-identification of items of data by putting it through a de-anonymization process, thus making facts which were intended to not name particular people to become associated with those people
* insecurity, such as lack of data security, which includes when an organization is supposed to be responsible for protecting data instead suffers a data breach which harms the people whose data it held
* secondary use, which is when people agree to share their data for a certain purpose, but then the data is used in ways without the data donors&#x27; informed consent
* exclusion is the use of a person&#x27;s data without any attempt to give the person an opportunity to manage the data or participate in its usage

===Information dissemination===
Information dissemination is an attack on privacy when information which was shared in confidence is shared or threatened to be shared in a way that harms the subject of the information.

There are various examples of this. Breach of confidentiality is when one entity promises to keep a person&#x27;s information private, then breaks that promise. Disclosure is making information about a person more accessible in a way that harms the subject of the information, regardless of how the information was collected or the intent of making it available. Exposure is a special type of disclosure in which the information disclosed is emotional to the subject or taboo to share, such as revealing their private life experiences, their nudity, or perhaps private body functions. Increased accessibility means advertising the availability of information without actually distributing it, as in the case of doxing. Blackmail is making a threat to share information, perhaps as part of an effort to coerce someone. Appropriation is an attack on the personhood of someone, and can include using the value of someone&#x27;s reputation or likeness to advance interests which are not those of the person being appropriated. Distortion is the creation of misleading information or lies about a person.

===Invasion===
Invasion of privacy, a subset of expectation of privacy, is a different concept from the collecting, aggregating, and disseminating information because those three are a misuse of available data, whereas invasion is an attack on the right of individuals to keep personal secrets. An invasion is an attack in which information, whether intended to be public or not, is captured in a way that insults the personal dignity and right to private space of the person whose data is taken.

====Intrusion====
An &quot;intrusion&quot; is any unwanted entry into a person&#x27;s private personal space and solitude for any reason, regardless of whether data is taken during that breach of space. &quot;Decisional interference&quot; is when an entity somehow injects itself into the personal decision-making process of another person, perhaps to influence that person&#x27;s private decisions but in any case doing so in a way that disrupts the private personal thoughts that a person has.

====Examples of invasions of privacy====
* In 2019, contract workers for Apple and Amazon reported being forced to continue listening to &quot;intimate moments&quot; captured on the companies&#x27; smart speakers in order to improve the quality of their automated speech recognition software.

==Techniques to improve privacy==
Similarly to actions which reduce privacy, there are multiple angles of privacy and multiple techniques to improve them to varying extents. When actions are done at an organizational level, they may be referred to as cybersecurity.

===Encryption===

Individuals can encrypt e-mails via enabling either two encryption protocols, S/MIME, which is built into companies like Apple or Outlook and thus most common, or PGP. The Signal messaging app, which encrypts messages so that only the recipient can read the message, is notable for being available on many mobile devices and implementing a form of perfect forward secrecy. Signal has received praise from whistleblower Edward Snowden. Encryption and other privacy-based security measures are also used in some cryptocurrencies such as Monero and ZCash.

===Anonymity===
Anonymizing proxies or anonymizing networks like I2P and Tor can be used to prevent Internet service providers (ISP) from knowing which sites one visits and with whom one communicates, by hiding IP addresses and location, but does not necessarily protect a user from third party data mining. Anonymizing proxies are built into a user&#x27;s device, in comparison to a Virtual Private Network (VPN), where users must download software. Using a VPN hides all data and connections that are exchanged between servers and a user&#x27;s computer, resulting in the online data of the user being unshared and secure, providing a barrier between the user and their ISP, and is especially important to use when a user is connected to public Wi-Fi. However, users should understand that all their data does flow through the VPN&#x27;s servers rather than the ISP. Users should decide for themselves if they wish to use either an anonymizing proxy or a VPN.

In a more non-technical sense, using incognito mode or private browsing mode will prevent a user&#x27;s computer from saving history, Internet files, and cookies, but the ISP will still have access to the users&#x27; search history. Using anonymous search engines will not share a user&#x27;s history, clicks, and will obstruct ad blockers.

===User empowerment===

Concrete solutions on how to solve paradoxical behavior still do not exist. Many efforts are focused on processes of decision making, like restricting data access permissions during application installation, but this would not completely bridge the gap between user intention and behavior. Susanne Barth and Menno D.T. de Jong believe that for users to make more conscious decisions on privacy matters, the design needs to be more user-oriented.

===Other security measures===
In a social sense, simply limiting the amount of personal information that users posts on social media could increase their security, which in turn makes it harder for criminals to perform identity theft. Moreover, creating a set of complex passwords and using two-factor authentication can allow users to be less susceptible to their accounts being compromised when various data leaks occur. Furthermore, users should protect their digital privacy by using anti-virus software, which can block harmful viruses like a pop-up scanning for personal information on a users&#x27; computer.

===Legal methods===
Although there are laws that promote the protection of users, in some countries, like the U.S., there is no federal digital privacy law and privacy settings are essentially limited by the state of current enacted privacy laws. To further their privacy, users can start conversing with representatives, letting representatives know that privacy is a main concern, which in turn increases the likelihood of further privacy laws being enacted.

==Privacy in non-human animals==
David Attenborough, a biologist and natural historian, affirmed that gorillas &quot;value their privacy&quot; while discussing a brief escape by a gorilla in London Zoo.

Lack of privacy in public spaces, caused by overcrowding, increases health issues in animals, including heart disease and high blood pressure. Also, the stress from overcrowding is connected to an increase in infant mortality rates and maternal stress. The lack of privacy that comes with overcrowding is connected to other issues in animals, which causes their relationships with others to diminish. How they present themselves to others of their species is a necessity in their life, and overcrowding causes the relationships to become disordered.

For example, David Attenborough claims that the gorilla&#x27;s right to privacy is being violated when they are looked at through glass enclosures. They are aware that they are being looked at, therefore they do not have control over how much the onlookers can see of them. Gorillas and other animals may be in the enclosures due to safety reasons, however Attenborough states that this is not an excuse for them to be constantly watched by unnecessary eyes. Also, animals will start hiding in unobserved spaces. Animals in zoos have been found to exhibit harmful or different behaviours due to the presence of visitors watching them:
* Cotton-top tamarins in zoos engage in less social behaviours, including physical contact and sex, than ones in off-exhibit buildings.
* Chimpanzees become more aggressive towards each other.
* Lion-tailed macaques pace and bite themselves more in direct proportions to human visitors.
* In one zoo, orangutans have been shown to cover their heads less as the density of visitors decreased.

<text>The proton–proton chain, also commonly referred to as the chain, is one of two known sets of nuclear fusion reactions by which stars convert hydrogen to helium. It dominates in stars with masses less than or equal to that of the Sun, whereas the CNO cycle, the other known reaction, is suggested by theoretical models to dominate in stars with masses greater than about 1.3 solar masses.

In general, proton–proton fusion can occur only if the kinetic energy (temperature) of the protons is high enough to overcome their mutual electrostatic repulsion.

In the Sun, deuteron-producing events are rare. Diprotons are the much more common result of proton–proton reactions within the star, and diprotons almost immediately decay back into two protons. Since the conversion of hydrogen to helium is slow, the complete conversion of the hydrogen initially in the core of the Sun is calculated to take more than ten billion years.

Although sometimes called the &quot;proton–proton chain reaction&quot;, it is not a chain reaction in the normal sense. In most nuclear reactions, a chain reaction designates a reaction that produces a product, such as neutrons given off during fission, that quickly induces another such reaction. 
The proton–proton chain is, like a decay chain, a series of reactions. The product of one reaction is the starting material of the next reaction. There are two main chains leading from hydrogen to helium in the Sun. One chain has five reactions, the other chain has six.

==History of the theory==
The theory that proton–proton reactions are the basic principle by which the Sun and other stars burn was advocated by Arthur Eddington in the 1920s. At the time, the temperature of the Sun was considered to be too low to overcome the Coulomb barrier. After the development of quantum mechanics, it was discovered that tunneling of the wavefunctions of the protons through the repulsive barrier allows for fusion at a lower temperature than the classical prediction.

In 1939, Hans Bethe attempted to calculate the rates of various reactions in stars. Starting with two protons combining to give a deuterium nucleus and a positron he found what we now call Branch II of the proton–proton chain. But he did not consider the reaction of two nuclei (Branch I) which we now know to be important. This was part of the body of work in stellar nucleosynthesis for which Bethe won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1967.

==The proton–proton chain==
The first step in all the branches is the fusion of two protons into a deuteron. As the protons fuse, one of them undergoes beta plus decay, converting into a neutron by emitting a positron and an electron neutrino (though a small amount of deuterium nuclei is produced by the &quot;pep&quot; reaction, see below):

The positron will annihilate with an electron from the environment into two gamma rays. Including this annihilation and the energy of the neutrino, the net reaction

(which is the same as the PEP reaction, see below) has a &quot;Q&quot; value (released energy) of 1.442 MeV:
The relative amounts of energy going to the neutrino and to the other products is variable.

This is the rate-limiting reaction and is extremely slow due to it being initiated by the weak nuclear force. The average proton in the core of the Sun waits 9 billion years before it successfully fuses with another proton. It has not been possible to measure the cross-section of this reaction experimentally because it is so low but it can be calculated from theory.

After it is formed, the deuteron produced in the first stage can fuse with another proton to produce the stable, light isotope of helium, :

This process, mediated by the strong nuclear force rather than the weak force, is extremely fast by comparison to the first step. It is estimated that, under the conditions in the Sun&#x27;s core, each newly created deuterium nucleus exists for only about one second before it is converted into helium-3.

In the Sun, each helium-3 nucleus produced in these reactions exists for only about 400 years before it is converted into helium-4. Once the helium-3 has been produced, there are four possible paths to generate . In , helium-4 is produced by fusing two helium-3 nuclei; the and branches fuse with pre-existing to form beryllium-7, which undergoes further reactions to produce two helium-4 nuclei.

About 99% of the energy output of the sun comes from the various chains, with the other 1% coming from the CNO cycle. According to one model of the sun, 83.3 percent of the produced by the various branches is produced via branch I while produces 16.68 percent and 0.02 percent. Since half the neutrinos produced in branches II and III are produced in the first step (synthesis of a deuteron), only about 8.35 percent of neutrinos come from the later steps (see below), and about 91.65 percent are from deuteron synthesis. However, another solar model from around the same time gives only 7.14 percent of neutrinos from the later steps and 92.86 percent from the synthesis of deuterium nuclei. The difference is apparently due to slightly different assumptions about the composition and metallicity of the sun.

There is also the extremely rare branch. Other even rarer reactions may occur. The rate of these reactions is very low due to very small cross-sections, or because the number of reacting particles is so low that any reactions that might happen are statistically insignificant.

The overall reaction is:

releasing 26.73 MeV of energy, some of which is lost to the neutrinos.

===The branch===

The complete chain releases a net energy of but 2.2 percent of this energy (0.59 MeV) is lost to the neutrinos that are produced.
The branch is dominant at temperatures of 10 to .
Below , the chain proceeds at slow rate, resulting in a low production of .

===The branch===
:

The branch is dominant at temperatures of 18 to .

Note that the energies in the second reaction above are the energies of the neutrinos that are produced by the reaction. 90 percent of the neutrinos produced in the reaction of to carry an energy of , while the remaining 10 percent carry . The difference is whether the lithium-7 produced is in the ground state or an excited (metastable) state, respectively. The total energy released going from to stable is about 0.862 MeV, almost all of which is lost to the neutrino if the decay goes directly to the stable lithium.

===The branch===

The last three stages of this chain, plus the positron annihilation, contribute a total of 18.209 MeV, though much of this is lost to the neutrino.

The chain is dominant if the temperature exceeds .

The chain is not a major source of energy in the Sun, but it was very important in the solar neutrino problem because it generates very high energy neutrinos (up to ).

===The (Hep) branch===
This reaction is predicted theoretically, but it has never been observed due to its rarity (about in the Sun). In this reaction, helium-3 captures a proton directly to give helium-4, with an even higher possible neutrino energy (up to ).

The mass–energy relationship gives for the energy released by this reaction plus the ensuing annihilation, some of which is lost to the neutrino.

===Energy release===
Comparing the mass of the final helium-4 nucleus with the masses of the four protons reveals that 0.7 percent of the mass of the original protons has been lost. This mass has been converted into energy, in the form of kinetic energy of produced particles, gamma rays, and neutrinos released during each of the individual reactions. The total energy yield of one whole chain is .

Energy released as gamma rays will interact with electrons and protons and heat the interior of the Sun. Also kinetic energy of fusion products (e.g. of the two protons and the from the reaction) adds energy to the plasma in the Sun. This heating keeps the core of the Sun hot and prevents it from collapsing under its own weight as it would if the sun were to cool down.

Neutrinos do not interact significantly with matter and therefore do not heat the interior and thereby help support the Sun against gravitational collapse. Their energy is lost: the neutrinos in the , , and chains carry away 2.0%, 4.0%, and 28.3% of the energy in those reactions, respectively.

The following table calculates the amount of energy lost to neutrinos and the amount of &quot;solar luminosity&quot; coming from the three branches. &quot;Luminosity&quot; here means the amount of energy given off by the Sun as electromagnetic radiation rather than as neutrinos. The starting figures used are the ones mentioned higher in this article. The table concerns only the 99% of the power and neutrinos that come from the reactions, not the 1% coming from the CNO cycle.

==The PEP reaction==

A deuteron can also be produced by the rare pep (proton–electron–proton) reaction (electron capture):

In the Sun, the frequency ratio of the pep reaction versus the reaction is 1:400. However, the neutrinos released by the pep reaction are far more energetic: while neutrinos produced in the first step of the reaction range in energy up to , the pep reaction produces sharp-energy-line neutrinos of . Detection of solar neutrinos from this reaction were reported by the Borexino collaboration in 2012.

Both the pep and reactions can be seen as two different Feynman representations of the same basic interaction, where the electron passes to the right side of the reaction as a positron. This is represented in the figure of proton–proton and electron-capture reactions in a star, available at the NDM&#x27;06 web site.

<doc id="25011" wikidata="Q25367" url="?curid=25011" title="Plankton">
<text>Plankton are the diverse collection of organisms that drift in water (or air) but are unable to actively propel themselves against currents (or wind). The individual organisms constituting plankton are called plankters. In the ocean, they provide a crucial source of food to many small and large aquatic organisms, such as bivalves, fish, and baleen whales.

Marine plankton include bacteria, archaea, algae, protozoa, microscopic fungi, and drifting or floating animals that inhabit the saltwater of oceans and the brackish waters of estuaries. Freshwater plankton are similar to marine plankton, but are found in lakes and rivers. Mostly, plankton just drift where currents take them, though some, like jellyfish, swim slowly but not fast enough to generally overcome the influence of currents.

Although plankton are usually thought of as inhabiting water, there are also airborne versions that live part of their lives drifting in the atmosphere. These &quot;aeroplankton&quot; include plant spores, pollen and wind-scattered seeds. They may also include microorganisms swept into the air from terrestrial dust storms and oceanic plankton swept into the air by sea spray.

Though many planktonic species are microscopic in size, &quot;plankton&quot; includes organisms over a wide range of sizes, including large organisms such as jellyfish. This is because plankton are defined by their ecological niche and level of motility rather than by any phylogenetic or taxonomic classification. The &quot;plankton&quot; category differentiates these organisms from those that float on the water&#x27;s surface, called &quot;neuston,&quot; those that can swim against a current, called &quot;nekton&quot;, and those that live on the deep sea floor, called &quot;benthos&quot;.

== Terminology ==
The name &quot;plankton&quot; was coined by German marine biologist Victor Hensen in 1887 from shortening the word &quot;halyplankton&quot; from Greek &quot;háls&quot; &quot;sea&quot; and &quot;planáō&quot; to &quot;drift&quot; or &quot;wander&quot;. While some forms are capable of independent movement and can swim hundreds of meters vertically in a single day (a behavior called diel vertical migration), their horizontal position is primarily determined by the surrounding water movement, and plankton typically flow with ocean currents. This is in contrast to nekton organisms, such as fish, squid and marine mammals, which can swim against the ambient flow and control their position in the environment.

Within the plankton, holoplankton spend their entire life cycle as plankton (e.g. most algae, copepods, salps, and some jellyfish). By contrast, meroplankton are only planktic for part of their lives (usually the larval stage), and then graduate to either a nektic (swimming) or benthic (sea floor) existence. Examples of meroplankton include the larvae of sea urchins, starfish, crustaceans, marine worms, and most fish.

The amount and distribution of plankton depends on available nutrients, the state of water and a large amount of other plankton.

The study of plankton is termed planktology and a planktonic individual is referred to as a plankter. The adjective &quot;planktonic&quot; is widely used in both the scientific and popular literature, and is a generally accepted term. However, from the standpoint of prescriptive grammar, the less-commonly used &quot;planktic&quot; is more strictly the correct adjective. When deriving English words from their Greek or Latin roots, the gender-specific ending (in this case, &quot;-on&quot; which indicates the word is neuter) is normally dropped, using only the root of the word in the derivation.


== Trophic groups ==
Plankton are primarily divided into broad functional (or trophic level) groups: 
*Phytoplankton (from Greek &quot;phyton&quot;, or plant) are autotrophic prokaryotic or eukaryotic algae that live near the water surface where there is sufficient light to support photosynthesis. Among the more important groups are the diatoms, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, and coccolithophores.
*Zooplankton (from Greek &quot;zoon&quot;, or animal) are small protozoans or metazoans (e.g. crustaceans and other animals) that feed on other plankton. Some of the eggs and larvae of larger nektonic animals, such as fish, crustaceans, and annelids, are included here.
*Mycoplankton include fungi and fungus-like organisms, which, like bacterioplankton, are also significant in remineralisation and nutrient cycling.
*Bacterioplankton include bacteria and archaea, which play an important role in remineralising organic material down the water column (note that prokaryotic phytoplankton are also bacterioplankton).
*Virioplankton are viruses. Viruses are more abundant in the plankton than bacteria and archaea, though much smaller.

=== Mixoplankton ===
*Mixotrophs. Plankton have traditionally been categorized as producer, consumer, and recycler groups, but some plankton are able to benefit from more than just one trophic level. In this mixed trophic strategy—known as mixotrophy—organisms act as both producers and consumers, either at the same time or switching between modes of nutrition in response to ambient conditions. This makes it possible to use photosynthesis for growth when nutrients and light are abundant, but switch to eating phytoplankton, zooplankton or each other when growing conditions are poor. Mixotrophs are divided into two groups; constitutive mixotrophs (CMs) which are able to perform photosynthesis on their own, and non-constitutive mixotrophs (NCMs) which use phagocytosis to engulf phototrophic prey that are either kept alive inside the host cell, which benefits from its photosynthesis, or they digested, except for the plastids, which continue to perform photosynthesis (kleptoplasty).
Recognition of the importance of mixotrophy as an ecological strategy is increasing, as well as the wider role this may play in marine biogeochemistry. Studies have shown that mixotrophs are much more important for marine ecology than previously assumed and comprise more than half of all microscopic plankton. Their presence acts as a buffer that prevents the collapse of ecosystems during times with little to no light.

== Size groups ==
Plankton are also often described in terms of size. Usually the following divisions are used: 
 
However, some of these terms may be used with very different boundaries, especially on the larger end. The existence and importance of nano- and even smaller plankton was only discovered during the 1980s, but they are thought to make up the largest proportion of all plankton in number and diversity.

The microplankton and smaller groups are microorganisms and operate at low Reynolds numbers, where the viscosity of water is more important than its mass or inertia.


==Habitat groups==

===Marine plankton===
Marine plankton includes marine bacteria and archaea, algae, protozoa and drifting or floating animals that inhabit the saltwater of oceans and the brackish waters of estuaries.

===Freshwater plankton===
Freshwater plankton are similar to marine plankton, but are found inland in the freshwaters of lakes and rivers.

===Aeroplankton===

Aeroplankton are tiny lifeforms that float and drift in the air, carried by the current of the wind; they are the atmospheric analogue to oceanic plankton. Most of the living things that make up aeroplankton are very small to microscopic in size, and many can be difficult to identify because of their tiny size. Scientists can collect them for study in traps and sweep nets from aircraft, kites or balloons. Aeroplankton is made up of numerous microbes, including viruses, about 1000 different species of bacteria, around 40,000 varieties of fungi, and hundreds of species of protists, algae, mosses and liverworts that live some part of their life cycle as aeroplankton, often as spores, pollen, and wind-scattered seeds. Additionally, peripatetic microorganisms are swept into the air from terrestrial dust storms, and an even larger amount of airborne marine microorganisms are propelled high into the atmosphere in sea spray. Aeroplankton deposits hundreds of millions of airborne viruses and tens of millions of bacteria every day on every square meter around the planet.

The sea surface microlayer, compared to the sub-surface waters, contains elevated concentration of bacteria and viruses. These materials can be transferred from the sea-surface to the atmosphere in the form of wind-generated aqueous aerosols due to their high vapour tension and a process known as volatilisation. When airborne, these microbes can be transported long distances to coastal regions. If they hit land they can have an effect on animal, vegetation and human health. Marine aerosols that contain viruses can travel hundreds of kilometers from their source and remain in liquid form as long as the humidity is high enough (over 70%). These aerosols are able to remain suspended in the atmosphere for about 31 days. Evidence suggests that bacteria can remain viable after being transported inland through aerosols. Some reached as far as 200 meters at 30 meters above sea level. The process which transfers this material to the atmosphere causes further enrichment in both bacteria and viruses in comparison to either the SML or sub-surface waters (up to three orders of magnitude in some locations).

===Geoplankton===
Many animals live in terrestrial environments by thriving in transient often microscopic bodies of water and moisture, these include rotifers and gastrotrichs which lay resilient eggs capable of surviving years in dry environments, and some of which can go dormant themselves. Nematodes are usually microscopic with this lifestyle. Water bears, despite only having lifespans of a few months, famously can enter suspended animation during dry or hostile conditions and survive for decades. This allows them to be ubiquitous in terrestrial environments despite needing water to grow and reproduce. Many microscopic crustacean groups like copepods and amphipods (of which sandhoppers are members) and seed shrimp are known to go dormant when dry and live in transient bodies of water too

==Other groups==

===Gelatinous zooplankton===

Gelatinous zooplankton are fragile animals that live in the water column in the ocean. Their delicate bodies have no hard parts and are easily damaged or destroyed. Gelatinous zooplankton are often transparent. All jellyfish are gelatinous zooplankton, but not all gelatinous zooplankton are jellyfish. The most commonly encountered organisms include ctenophores, medusae, salps, and Chaetognatha in coastal waters. However, almost all marine phyla, including Annelida, Mollusca and Arthropoda, contain gelatinous species, but many of those odd species live in the open ocean and the deep sea and are less available to the casual ocean observer.

===Ichthyoplankton===

Ichthyoplankton are the eggs and larvae of fish. They are mostly found in the sunlit zone of the water column, less than 200 metres deep, which is sometimes called the epipelagic or photic zone. Ichthyoplankton are planktonic, meaning they cannot swim effectively under their own power, but must drift with the ocean currents. Fish eggs cannot swim at all, and are unambiguously planktonic. Early stage larvae swim poorly, but later stage larvae swim better and cease to be planktonic as they grow into juveniles. Fish larvae are part of the zooplankton that eat smaller plankton, while fish eggs carry their food supply. Both eggs and larvae are themselves eaten by larger animals. Fish can produce high numbers of eggs which are often released into the open water column. Fish eggs typically have a diameter of about . The newly hatched young of oviparous fish are called larvae. They are usually poorly formed, carry a large yolk sac (for nourishment), and are very different in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous fish is relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed metamorphosis) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on zooplankton prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae. In time fish larvae become able to swim against currents, at which point they cease to be plankton and become juvenile fish.

===Holoplankton===

Holoplankton are organisms that are planktic for their entire life cycle. Holoplankton can be contrasted with meroplankton, which are planktic organisms that spend part of their life cycle in the benthic zone. Examples of holoplankton include some diatoms, radiolarians, some dinoflagellates, foraminifera, amphipods, krill, copepods, and salps, as well as some gastropod mollusk species. Holoplankton dwell in the pelagic zone as opposed to the benthic zone. Holoplankton include both phytoplankton and zooplankton and vary in size. The most common plankton are protists.

===Meroplankton===

Meroplankton are a wide variety of aquatic organisms that have both planktonic and benthic stages in their life cycles. Much of the meroplankton consists of larval stages of larger organisms. Meroplankton can be contrasted with holoplankton, which are planktonic organisms that stay in the pelagic zone as plankton throughout their entire life cycle. After some time in the plankton, many meroplankton graduate to the nekton or adopt a benthic (often sessile) lifestyle on the seafloor. The larval stages of benthic invertebrates make up a significant proportion of planktonic communities. The planktonic larval stage is particularly crucial to many benthic invertebrates in order to disperse their young. Depending on the particular species and the environmental conditions, larval or juvenile-stage meroplankton may remain in the pelagic zone for durations ranging from hours to months.

===Pseudoplankton===
Pseudoplankton are organisms that attach themselves to planktonic organisms or other floating objects, such as drifting wood, buoyant shells of organisms such as &quot;Spirula&quot;, or man-made flotsam. Examples include goose barnacles and the bryozoan &quot;Jellyella&quot;. By themselves these animals cannot float, which contrasts them with true planktonic organisms, such as &quot;Velella&quot; and the Portuguese Man o&#x27; War, which are buoyant. Pseudoplankton are often found in the guts of filtering zooplankters.

===Tychoplankton===
Tychoplankton are organisms, such as free-living or attached benthic organisms and other non-planktonic organisms, that are carried into the plankton through a disturbance of their benthic habitat, or by winds and currents. This can occur by direct turbulence or by disruption of the substrate and subsequent entrainment in the water column. Tychoplankton are, therefore, a primary subdivision for sorting planktonic organisms by duration of lifecycle spent in the plankton, as neither their entire lives nor particular reproductive portions are confined to planktonic existence. Tychoplankton are sometimes called &quot;accidental plankton&quot;.

===Mineralized plankton===


== Distribution ==
Apart from aeroplankton, plankton inhabits oceans, seas, lakes and ponds. Local abundance varies horizontally, vertically and seasonally. The primary cause of this variability is the availability of light. All plankton ecosystems are driven by the input of solar energy (but see chemosynthesis), confining primary production to surface waters, and to geographical regions and seasons having abundant light.

A secondary variable is nutrient availability. Although large areas of the tropical and sub-tropical oceans have abundant light, they experience relatively low primary production because they offer limited nutrients such as nitrate, phosphate and silicate. This results from large-scale ocean circulation and water column stratification. In such regions, primary production usually occurs at greater depth, although at a reduced level (because of reduced light).

Despite significant macronutrient concentrations, some ocean regions are unproductive (so-called HNLC regions). The micronutrient iron is deficient in these regions, and adding it can lead to the formation of phytoplankton algal blooms. Iron primarily reaches the ocean through the deposition of dust on the sea surface. Paradoxically, oceanic areas adjacent to unproductive, arid land thus typically have abundant phytoplankton (e.g., the eastern Atlantic Ocean, where trade winds bring dust from the Sahara Desert in north Africa).

While plankton are most abundant in surface waters, they live throughout the water column. At depths where no primary production occurs, zooplankton and bacterioplankton instead consume organic material sinking from more productive surface waters above. This flux of sinking material, so-called marine snow, can be especially high following the termination of spring blooms.

The local distribution of plankton can be affected by wind-driven Langmuir circulation and the biological effects of this physical process.

== Ecological significance ==

===Food chain===

As well as representing the lower levels of a food chain that supports commercially important fisheries, plankton ecosystems play a role in the biogeochemical cycles of many important chemical elements, including the ocean&#x27;s carbon cycle. Fish larvae mainly eat zooplankton, which in turn eat phytoplankton

===Carbon cycle===
Primarily by grazing on phytoplankton, zooplankton provide carbon to the planktic foodweb, either respiring it to provide metabolic energy, or upon death as biomass or detritus. Organic material tends to be denser than seawater, so it sinks into open ocean ecosystems away from the coastlines, transporting carbon along with it. This process, called the biological pump, is one reason that oceans constitute the largest carbon sink on Earth. However, it has been shown to be influenced by increments of temperature. In 2019, a study indicated that at ongoing rates of seawater acidification, Antarctic phytoplanktons could become smaller and less effective at storing carbon before the end of the century.

It might be possible to increase the ocean&#x27;s uptake of carbon dioxide () generated through human activities by increasing plankton production through iron fertilization – introducing amounts of iron into the ocean. However, this technique may not be practical at a large scale. Ocean oxygen depletion and resultant methane production (caused by the excess production remineralising at depth) is one potential drawback.

===Oxygen production===
Phytoplankton absorb energy from the Sun and nutrients from the water to produce their own nourishment or energy. In the process of photosynthesis, phytoplankton release molecular oxygen () into the water as a waste byproduct. It is estimated that about 50% of the world&#x27;s oxygen is produced via phytoplankton photosynthesis. The rest is produced via photosynthesis on land by plants. Furthermore, phytoplankton photosynthesis has controlled the atmospheric / balance since the early Precambrian Eon.

===Absorption efficiency===
The &quot;absorption efficiency&quot; (AE) of plankton is the proportion of food absorbed by the plankton that determines how available the consumed organic materials are in meeting the required physiological demands. Depending on the feeding rate and prey composition, variations in absorption efficiency may lead to variations in fecal pellet production, and thus regulates how much organic material is recycled back to the marine environment. Low feeding rates typically lead to high absorption efficiency and small, dense pellets, while high feeding rates typically lead to low absorption efficiency and larger pellets with more organic content. Another contributing factor to dissolved organic matter (DOM) release is respiration rate. Physical factors such as oxygen availability, pH, and light conditions may affect overall oxygen consumption and how much carbon is loss from zooplankton in the form of respired . The relative sizes of zooplankton and prey also mediate how much carbon is released via sloppy feeding. Smaller prey are ingested whole, whereas larger prey may be fed on more &quot;sloppily&quot;, that is more biomatter is released through inefficient consumption. There is also evidence that diet composition can impact nutrient release, with carnivorous diets releasing more dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and ammonium than omnivorous diets.

==Biomass variability==
The growth of phytoplankton populations is dependent on light levels and nutrient availability. The chief factor limiting growth varies from region to region in the world&#x27;s oceans. On a broad scale, growth of phytoplankton in the oligotrophic tropical and subtropical gyres is generally limited by nutrient supply, while light often limits phytoplankton growth in subarctic gyres. Environmental variability at multiple scales influences the nutrient and light available for phytoplankton, and as these organisms form the base of the marine food web, this variability in phytoplankton growth influences higher trophic levels. For example, at interannual scales phytoplankton levels temporarily plummet during El Niño periods, influencing populations of zooplankton, fishes, sea birds, and marine mammals.

The effects of anthropogenic warming on the global population of phytoplankton is an area of active research. Changes in the vertical stratification of the water column, the rate of temperature-dependent biological reactions, and the atmospheric supply of nutrients are expected to have important impacts on future phytoplankton productivity. Additionally, changes in the mortality of phytoplankton due to rates of zooplankton grazing may be significant.

== Planktonic relationships ==
===Fish and plankton===

Zooplankton are the initial prey item for almost all fish larvae as they switch from their yolk sacs to external feeding. Fish rely on the density and distribution of zooplankton to match that of new larvae, which can otherwise starve. Natural factors (e.g., current variations, temperature changes) and man-made factors (e.g. river dams, ocean acidification, rising temperatures) can strongly affect zooplankton populations, which can in turn strongly affect fish larval survival, and therefore breeding success.

It has been shown that plankton can be patchy in marine environments where there aren&#x27;t significant fish populations and additionally, where fish are abundant, zooplankton dynamics are influenced by the fish predation rate in their environment. Depending on the predation rate, they could express regular or chaotic behavior.

A negative effect that fish larvae can have on planktonic algal blooms is that the larvae will prolong the blooming event by diminishing available zooplankton numbers; this in turn permits excessive phytoplankton growth allowing the bloom to flourish .

The importance of both phytoplankton and zooplankton is also well-recognized in extensive and semi-intensive pond fish farming. Plankton population-based pond management strategies for fish rearing have been practiced by traditional fish farmers for decades, illustrating the importance of plankton even in man-made environments.

===Whales and plankton===
Of all animal fecal matter, it is whale feces that is the &#x27;trophy&#x27; in terms of increasing nutrient availability. Phytoplankton are the powerhouse of open ocean primary production and they can acquire many nutrients from whale feces. In the marine food web, phytoplankton are at the base of the food web and are consumed by zooplankton &amp; krill, which are preyed upon by larger and larger marine organisms, including whales, so it can be said that whale feces fuels the entire food web.

=== Humans and plankton ===
Plankton have many direct and indirect effects on humans.

Around 70% of the oxygen in the atmosphere is produced in the oceans from phytoplankton performing photosynthesis, meaning that the majority of the oxygen available for us and other organisms that respire aerobically is produced by plankton.

Plankton also make up the base of the marine food web, providing food for all the trophic levels above. Recent studies have analyzed the marine food web to see if the system runs on a top-down or bottom-up approach. Essentially, this research is focused on understanding whether changes in the food web are driven by nutrients at the bottom of the food web or predators at the top. The general conclusion is that the bottom-up approach seemed to be more predictive of food web behavior. This indicates that plankton have more sway in determining the success of the primary consumer species that prey on them than do the secondary consumers that prey on the primary consumers.

In some cases, plankton act as an intermediate host for deadly parasites in humans. One such case is that of cholera, an infection caused by several pathogenic strains of &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot;. These species have been shown to have a symbiotic relationship with chitinous zooplankton species like copepods. These bacteria benefit not only from the food provided by the chiton from the zooplankton, but also from the protection from acidic environments. Once the copepods have been ingested by a human host, the chitinous exterior protects the bacteria from the stomach acids in the stomach and proceed to the intestines. Once there, the bacteria bind with the surface of the small intestine and the host will start developing symptoms, including extreme diarrhea, within five days.

<text>Pi Day is an annual celebration of the mathematical constant (pi). Pi Day is observed on March 14 (the 3rd month) since 3, 1, and 4 are the first three significant figures of , and was first celebrated in the United States. It was founded in 1988 by Larry Shaw, an employee of a science museum in San Francisco, the Exploratorium. Celebrations often involve eating pie or holding pi recitation competitions. In 2009, the United States House of Representatives supported the designation of Pi Day. UNESCO&#x27;s 40th General Conference designated Pi Day as the International Day of Mathematics in November 2019.

Other dates when people celebrate pi include Pi Approximation Day on July 22 (22/7 in the &quot;day/month&quot; format, an approximation of) and June 28 (6.28, an approximation of 2 or tau).

== History ==
In 1988, the earliest known official or large-scale celebration of Pi Day was organized by Larry Shaw at the San Francisco Exploratorium, where Shaw worked as a physicist, with staff and public marching around one of its circular spaces, then consuming fruit pies. The Exploratorium continues to hold Pi Day celebrations.

On March 12, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution (), recognizing March 14, 2009, as National Pi Day. For Pi Day 2010, Google presented a Google Doodle celebrating the holiday, with the word Google laid over images of circles and pi symbols; and for the 30th anniversary in 2018, it was a Dominique Ansel pie with the circumference divided by its diameter.

Some observed the entire month of March 2014 (3/14) as &quot;Pi Month&quot;. In the year 2015, March 14 was celebrated as &quot;Super Pi Day&quot;. It had special significance, as the date is written as 3/14/15 in month/day/year format. At 9:26:53, the date and time together represented the first ten digits of , and later that second, &quot;Pi Instant&quot; represented all of &#x27;s digits.

== Observance ==

Pi Day has been observed in many ways, including eating pie, throwing pies and discussing the significance of the number , due to a pun based on the words &quot;pi&quot; and &quot;pie&quot; being homophones in English (), and the coincidental circular shape of many pies. Many pizza and pie restaurants offer discounts, deals, and free products on Pi Day. Also, some schools hold competitions as to which student can recall pi to the highest number of decimal places.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has often mailed its application decision letters to prospective students for delivery on Pi Day. Starting in 2012, MIT has announced it will post those decisions (privately) online on Pi Day at exactly 6:28 pm, which they have called &quot;Tau Time&quot;, to honor the rival numbers pi and tau equally. In 2015, the regular decisions were put online at 9:26 am, following that year&#x27;s &quot;pi minute&quot;, and in 2020, regular decisions were released at 1:59 pm, making the first six digits of pi.

Princeton, New Jersey, hosts numerous events in a combined celebration of Pi Day and Albert Einstein&#x27;s birthday, which is also March 14. Einstein lived in Princeton for more than twenty years while working at the Institute for Advanced Study. In addition to pie eating and recitation contests, there is an annual Einstein look-alike contest.

In 2024, the recreational mathematician Matt Parker and a team of hundreds of volunteers at City of London School spent six days calculating 139 correct digits of pi by hand, in what Parker claimed was &quot;the biggest hand calculation in a century&quot;. On 15 August 2024, the main-belt asteroid 314159 Mattparker was named in his honor. The citation highlights Parker&#x27;s biennial &quot;Pi Day challenges&quot;, stating that they have helped to popularize mathematics.

== Alternative dates ==

Pi Day is frequently observed on March 14 (3/14 in the &quot;month/day&quot; date format), but related celebrations have been held on alternative dates.

Pi Approximation Day is observed on July 22 (22/7 in the &quot;day/month&quot; date format), since the fraction is a common approximation of, which is accurate to two decimal places and dates from Archimedes. In Indonesia, a country that uses the DD/MM/YYYY date format, some people celebrate Pi Day every July 22.

Tau Day, also known as Two-Pi Day, is observed on June 28 (6/28 in the &quot;month/day&quot; format). The number , denoted by the Greek letter tau, is the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its radius; it equals 2, a common multiple in mathematical formulae, and approximately equals 6.28. Some have argued that is the clearer and more fundamental constant and that Tau Day should be celebrated alongside or instead of Pi Day. Celebrants of this date jokingly suggest eating &quot;twice the pie&quot;.

Some also celebrate pi on November 10, since it is the 314th day of the year (in leap years, on November 9).

<text>The Excellent Prismatic Spray is a magazine devoted to the fantasy role-playing game &quot;Dying Earth&quot; and the author Jack Vance on whose works the game is based. The magazine is published intermittently by Pelgrane Press and is named for one of the spells used by various wizards in the &quot;Dying Earth&quot; stories.

==Publication history==
From 1950 to 1984, the science fiction and fantasy author Jack Vance wrote four &quot;Dying Earth&quot; books, all set in the distant future when the sun is almost exhausted and magic has asserted itself as a dominant force. In 2001, Pelgrane Press published a licensed role-playing game based on Vance&#x27;s setting. To provide supplementary material for the game, Pelgrane published the first issue of &quot;The Excellent Prismatic Spray&quot; in December 2000. Two issues followed in 2001, a double issue in 2003, Number 6 in 2004, and after a four-year hiatus, another double issue in 2008.

In the 2014 book &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons&quot;, game historian Shannon Appelcline noted that Pelgrane provided good support for &quot;The Dying Earth Roleplaying Game&quot; through 2008: &quot;That support began with eight issues of Pelgrane&#x27;s &quot;Dying Earth&quot; magazine, &quot;The Excellent Prismatic Spray&quot; (2000–2008), which featured articles by RPG luminaries like Keith Baker, Monte Cook, Ed Greenwood, Gary Gygax, and Phil Masters. One or two &quot;Dying Earth&quot; supplements also appeared every year, except 2004 and 2005. This included plenty of setting books and some books intended to support the higher levels of play: &quot;Turjan&#x27;s Tome of Beauty and Horror&quot; (2003) and &quot;Rhialto&#x27;s Book of Marvels&quot; (2006). Starting in 2005, Pelgrane also began publishing PDFs for the game, which allowed them to produce more adventures – which previously appeared mostly within &quot;The Excellent Prismatic Spray&quot;.&quot;

==Reception==
In a review of &quot;The Dying Earth Roleplaying Game&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, John ONeill said &quot;Much of the content of the magazine and the additional support material were written in studied imitation of Vance&#x27;s witty and erudite style, and made terrific reading.&quot;

Writing for &quot;The Guild Companion&quot;, Nicholas Caldwell reviewed the third issue of the magazine, published in 2001, and was impressed by it, calling it &quot;a masterful addition to the series and well worth the terces.&quot; He liked the tongue-in-cheek &quot;in-character advertisements for goods and services for sale or sought on the &quot;Dying Earth&quot;&quot; and also found both the artwork and the writing style struck the right note, saying that it was &quot;handsomely illustrated by fine cover and interior artwork, and with respectful emulation of the Vancian prose style and humor.&quot; He concluded, &quot;Instruct your factor to purchase a copy before the sun goes out!&quot;

<doc id="25018" wikidata="Q2063697" url="?curid=25018" title="Pauli effect">
<text>The Pauli effect or Pauli&#x27;s device corollary is the supposed tendency of technical equipment to encounter critical failure in the presence of certain people. The term was coined after mysterious anecdotal stories involving Austrian theoretical physicist Wolfgang Pauli, describing numerous instances in which demonstrations involving equipment suffered technical problems only when he was present.

The Pauli effect is not related to the Pauli exclusion principle, which is a bona fide physical phenomenon named after Pauli. However the Pauli effect was humorously tagged as a second Pauli exclusion principle, according to which &quot;a functioning device and Wolfgang Pauli may not occupy the same room&quot;. Pauli himself was convinced that the effect named after him was real. Pauli corresponded with Hans Bender and Carl Jung and saw the effect as an example of the concept of synchronicity.

== Background ==
Since the 20th century, the work in some subfields of physics research has been divided between theorists and experimentalists. Those theorists who lack an aptitude or interest in experimental work have on occasion earned a reputation for accidentally breaking experimental equipment. Pauli was exceptional in this regard: it was postulated that he was such a good theorist that any experiments would be compromised by virtue of his presence in the vicinity. For fear of the Pauli effect, experimental physicist Otto Stern banned Pauli from his laboratory located in Hamburg despite their friendship. Pauli was convinced that the effect named after him was real. He corresponded with Carl Jung and Marie-Louise von Franz about the concept of synchronicity and did so as well with Hans Bender, lecturer at Freiburg university Institut für Grenzgebiete der Psychologie und Psychohygiene, the only parapsychology chair in Germany.

Jung and Pauli saw some parallels between physics and depth psychology. Pauli was among the honored guests at the foundation festivities of the C.G. Jung Institute in Zürich in 1948. A famous Pauli effect at the ceremony—as he entered, a china flower vase fell on the floor without any obvious reason—caused Pauli to write his article &quot;Background-Physics&quot;, in which he tries to find complementary relationships between physics and depth psychology.

== Anecdotal evidence ==

An incident occurred in the physics laboratory at the University of Göttingen. An expensive measuring device, for no apparent reason, suddenly stopped working, although Pauli was in fact &quot;absent&quot;. James Franck, the director of the institute, reported the incident to his colleague Pauli in Zürich with the humorous remark that at least this time Pauli was innocent. However, it turned out that Pauli had been on a railway journey to Zürich and had switched trains in the Göttingen rail station at about the time of the failure. The incident is reported in George Gamow&#x27;s book &quot;Thirty Years That Shook Physics&quot;, where it is also claimed the more talented the theoretical physicist, the stronger the effect.

R. Peierls describes a case when at one reception this effect was to be parodied by deliberately crashing a chandelier upon Pauli&#x27;s entrance. The chandelier was suspended on a rope to be released, but it stuck instead, thus becoming a real example of the Pauli effect.

In 1934, Pauli saw a failure of his car during a honeymoon tour with his second wife as proof of a real Pauli effect since it occurred without an obvious external cause.

In February 1950, when he was at Princeton University, the cyclotron burnt, and he asked himself if this mischief belonged to such a Pauli effect, named after him.

==Cultural references==
Philip K. Dick makes reference to &quot;Pauli&#x27;s synchronicity&quot; in his 1963 science fiction novel &quot;The Game-Players of Titan&quot; in reference to pre-cognitive psionic abilities being interfered with by other psionic abilities such as psychokinesis: &quot;an acausal connective event.&quot;

Tatsuhisa Kamijō (Lucidien Kallister in the English version) is a self-claimed &#x27;demon-embodied&#x27; human who can randomly cause electronic devices such as phones and drones to malfunction or self destruct with his hands in the series &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Sevens&quot;. The main character, Yuga Ohdo attributes this to the Pauli Effect. 

Kent, a character from the visual novel and anime Amnesia: Fated Memories, also references this event in the anime adaptation when speaking to the heroine.

Captain Lochley, a character from Babylon 5 describes this effect to Lieutenant Corwin in the movie Babylon 5: The River of Souls and draws parallel to how all sorts of crisis seem to emerge only when President Sheridan or ex-security chief Garibaldi are at the station.

<text>Patrick Eamon Mills (born 1949) is an English comics writer and editor who, along with John Wagner, revitalised British boys&#x27; comics in the 1970s, and has remained a leading light in British comics ever since. He has been called &quot;the godfather of British comics&quot;.

His comics are notable for their violence and anti-authoritarianism. He is best known for creating &quot;2000 AD&quot; and playing a major part in the development of &quot;Judge Dredd&quot;.

==Biography==

Mills started his career as a sub-editor for D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd, where he met Wagner. In 1971 both left to go freelance, and were soon writing scripts for IPC&#x27;s girls&#x27; and humour comics. After D.C. Thomson launched &quot;Warlord&quot;, a successful war-themed weekly, Mills was asked in 1975 to develop a rival title for IPC. Based in the girls&#x27; comics department to avoid the attention of the staff of the boys&#x27; department, Mills, along with Wagner and Gerry Finley-Day, worked in secret to create &quot;Battle Picture Weekly&quot;. &quot;Battle&quot;&#x27;s stories were more violent and its characters more working class than IPC&#x27;s traditional fare, and it was an immediate hit. Having made the comic ready for launch, Mills resigned as editor. He would later write the celebrated First World War series &quot;Charley&#x27;s War&quot;, drawn by Joe Colquhoun, for the title.

After launching &quot;Battle&quot;, Mills began developing a new boys&#x27; title, &quot;Action&quot;, launched in 1976. &quot;Action&quot;&#x27;s mix of violence and anti-authoritarianism proved controversial and the title lasted less than a year before being withdrawn in the face of media protests. It was briefly revived in neutered form before being merged into &quot;Battle&quot;.

His next creation was the science fiction-themed weekly &quot;2000 AD&quot;, launched in 1977. As with &quot;Battle&quot; and &quot;Action&quot; he developed most of the early series before handing them over to other writers. He took over the development of &quot;Judge Dredd&quot; when creator John Wagner temporarily walked out, and wrote many of the early stories, establishing the character and his world, before Wagner returned.

In 1978 IPC launched &quot;Starlord&quot;, a short-lived companion title for &quot;2000 AD&quot;. Mills contributed &quot;Ro-Busters&quot;, a series about a robot disaster squad, which moved to &quot;2000 AD&quot; when &quot;Starlord&quot; was cancelled. &quot;Ro-Busters&quot; was the beginning of a mini-universe of interrelated stories Mills was to create for &quot;2000 AD&quot;, including &quot;ABC Warriors&quot; and &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot;. Artist Kevin O&#x27;Neill was involved in the creation of all three. Another strand of his &quot;2000 AD&quot; work was &quot;Sláine&quot;, a barbarian fantasy based on Celtic mythology and neo-paganism, which he co-created with his then wife Angela Kincaid (with whom he also created the children&#x27;s series of books, &quot;The Butterfly Children&quot;).

Mills also had a hand in IPC&#x27;s line of comics aimed at girls, such as &quot;Chiller&quot; (a horror comic), &quot;Misty&quot; (supernatural stories) and &quot;Jinty&quot; (science fiction).

In 1986 he edited the short-lived comic &quot;Diceman&quot;, which featured characters from &quot;2000 AD&quot; in political satire regarding U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Mills wrote nearly every story.

In 1988 he was involved in the launch of &quot;Crisis&quot;, a politically aware &quot;2000 AD&quot; spin-off aimed at older readers. For it he wrote &quot;Third World War&quot;, drawn initially by Carlos Ezquerra. The title lasted until 1991 and launched the careers of talents such as Garth Ennis, John Smith and Sean Phillips.

In 1991 Mills launched &quot;Toxic!&quot;, an independent colour newsstand weekly comic with a violent, anarchic tone, perhaps as a reaction against the politically worthy &quot;Crisis&quot;, and a creator-owned ideal. Many of the stories were created by Mills and co-writer Tony Skinner, including &quot;Accident Man&quot;, an assassin who makes his hits look like accidents. &quot;Toxic!&quot; lasted less than a year, but gave a start to talents such as Duke Mighten and Martin Emond.

He has had little success in American comics, with the exception of &quot;Metalzoic&quot; and &quot;Marshal Law&quot;, published by DC and Epic comics respectively in the late 1980s, both drawn by O&#x27;Neill. Mills&#x27; &quot;Toxic&quot; strips &quot;Accident Man&quot; and &quot;Brats Bizarre&quot; were reprinted as their own US-format titles (by Dark Horse Comics and Epic, respectively) and Mills wrote &quot;Punisher 2099&quot; for Marvel, &quot;Zombie World&quot; for Dark Horse, and &quot;Death Race 2020&quot; (reuniting Mills with Kevin O&#x27;Neill) for Roger Corman&#x27;s Cosmic Comics.

In 1995, he broke into the French market, one of his life&#x27;s goals, with &quot;Sha&quot;, created with French artist Olivier Ledroit.

He continues to write &quot;Sláine&quot;, &quot;Bill Savage&quot;, &quot;Black Siddha&quot; and &quot;ABC Warriors&quot; for &quot;2000 AD&quot;, and also the Franco-Belgian comic &quot;Requiem Vampire Knight&quot;, with art by Olivier Ledroit, and its spin-off &quot;Claudia Chevalier Vampire&quot;, with art by Franck Tacito.

Two new series, &quot;Greysuit&quot;, a super-powered government agent drawn by John Higgins, and &quot;Defoe&quot;, a 17th-century zombie hunter drawn by Leigh Gallagher, began in &quot;2000 AD&quot; prog 1540.

Mills has formed Repeat Offenders with artist Clint Langley and Jeremy Davis &quot;to develop graphic novel concepts with big-screen potential&quot; and the first project is a graphic novel called &quot;American Reaper&quot;, serialised in the &quot;Judge Dredd Megazine&quot; (2011–2015). It has been optioned by Trudie Styler&#x27;s Xingu Films and Mills has written the screenplay.

He has also written two &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio plays, &quot;Dead London&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Scapegoat&quot; (2009) for Big Finish Productions, featuring the Eighth Doctor and Lucie Miller. The first audio play was released as the first part of the second season of the Eighth Doctor Adventures and the second as part of the third season. In 2010 Mills adapted a story that had been started by him and Wagner for Doctor Who in the 1980s and was produced by Big Finish as &quot;The Song of Megaptera&quot;. In 2023, a 1980 Fourth Doctor comic he penned (with artist Dave Gibbons) for &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot; was adapted into the Fourteenth Doctor special &quot;The Star Beast.&quot;

In 2017 he wrote, with Kevin O&#x27;Neill, and published two novels, &quot;Serial Killer&quot; and &quot;Goodnight, John-Boy&quot;, part of a planned series of four books. Also in that year, he published his memoirs, &quot;Be Pure! Be Vigilant! Behave! 2000 AD and Judge Dredd: The Secret History&quot; in print and as an e-book. Mills also narrated the audiobook version himself. (The title is the catchphrase of the villain in his series &quot;Nemesis the Warlock&quot;.)

In 2018 the film &quot;Accident Man&quot; was released, based on his comic strip for &quot;Toxic!&quot;

In 2019 Mills announced that he would publish a new all-ages science fiction anthology comic called &quot;Spacewarp&quot;, to be released in 2020, and that the artists would retain the copyright on their work.

In 2021 he published another volume of memoirs with a focus on Slaine, &quot;Kiss My Axe! Slaine the Warped Warrior: The Secret History&quot;.

==Bibliography==

As well as his influential role in creating and contributing to numerous of British comics, Mills has produced work in both America and Europe.

<doc id="25021" wikidata="Q512514" url="?curid=25021" title="Pearl Index">
<text>The Pearl Index, also called the Pearl rate, is the most common technique used in clinical trials for reporting the effectiveness of a birth control method. It is a very approximate measure of the number of unintended pregnancies in 100 woman-years of exposure that is simple to calculate, but has a number of methodological deficiencies.

The index was introduced by Raymond Pearl in 1934. It has remained popular for over eighty years, in large part because of the simplicity of the calculation.

==Calculation==
Several kinds of information are needed to calculate a Pearl Index for a particular study:
* the total number of months or cycles of exposure by women in the study
* the number of pregnancies
* the reason for leaving the study (pregnancy or other reason)
* the number of children in a single pregnancy (twins or triplets can affect the final number)

There are two calculation methods for determining the Pearl Index:
* in the first method, the relative number of pregnancies in the study is divided by the number of months of exposure, and then multiplied by 1200
* in the second method, the number of pregnancies in the study is divided by the number of menstrual cycles experienced by women in the study, and then multiplied by 1300. 1300 instead of 1200 is used on the basis that the length of the average menstrual cycle is 28 days, or 13 cycles per year

== Usage ==
The Pearl Index is sometimes used as a statistical estimation of the number of unintended pregnancies in 100 woman-years of exposure (e.g. 100 women over one year of use, or 10 women over 10 years). It is also sometimes used to compare birth control methods, a lower Pearl index representing a lower chance of getting unintentionally pregnant.

Usually two Pearl Indexes are published from studies of birth control methods:
* the &quot;actual use&quot; Pearl Index, which includes all pregnancies in a study and all months (or cycles) of exposure
* the &quot;perfect use&quot; or &quot;method&quot; Pearl Index, which includes only pregnancies that resulted from correct and consistent use of the method, and only includes months or cycles in which the method was correctly and consistently used

==Criticisms==
Like all measures of birth control effectiveness, the Pearl Index is a calculation based on the observations of a given sample population. Thus, studies of different populations using the same contraceptive will yield different values for the index. The culture and demographics of the population being studied, and the instruction technique used to teach the method, have significant effects on its failure rate.

The Pearl Index has unique shortcomings, however. It assumes a constant failure rate over time. That is an incorrect assumption for two reasons: first, the most fertile couples will get pregnant first. Couples remaining later in the study are, on average, of lower fertility. Second, most birth control methods have better effectiveness in more experienced users. The longer a couple is in the study, the better they are at using the method. So the longer the study length, the lower the Pearl Index will be – and comparisons of Pearl Indexes from studies of different lengths cannot be accurate.

The Pearl Index also provides no information on factors other than accidental pregnancy which may influence effectiveness calculations, such as:
* dissatisfaction with the method
* trying to achieve pregnancy
* medical side effects
* being lost to follow-up

A common misperception is that the highest possible Pearl Index is 100 – i.e. 100% of women in the study conceive in the first year. However, if all the women in the study conceived in the first month, the study would yield a Pearl Index of 1200 or 1300. The Pearl Index is only accurate as a statistical estimation of per-year risk of pregnancy if the pregnancy rate in the study was very low.

In 1966, two birth control statisticians advocated abandonment of the Pearl Index:

<doc id="25022" wikidata="Q214642" url="?curid=25022" title="Paul Auster">
<text>Paul Benjamin Auster (February 3, 1947 – April 30, 2024) was an American writer, novelist, memoirist, poet, and filmmaker. His notable works include &quot;The New York Trilogy&quot; (1987), &quot;Moon Palace&quot; (1989), &quot;The Music of Chance&quot; (1990), &quot;The Book of Illusions&quot; (2002), &quot;The Brooklyn Follies&quot; (2005), &quot;Invisible&quot; (2009), &quot;Sunset Park&quot; (2010), &quot;Winter Journal&quot; (2012), and &quot;4 3 2 1&quot; (2017). His books have been translated into more than 40 languages.

==Early life==
Paul Auster was born in Newark, New Jersey, son of Samuel Auster, a landlord who owned buildings with his brothers in Jersey City, and Queenie, née Bogat. His middle-class parents were Jewish, of Austrian descent; the marriage was an unhappy one, and they divorced during Auster&#x27;s senior year of high school, he moving with his mother and sister to an apartment at Weequahic, Newark. An uncle was the translator Allen Mandelbaum. He grew up in South Orange, New Jersey, and Newark, and graduated from Columbia High School in Maplewood.

During the summers of 1958 and 1959, Auster attended, respectively, Camp LakeView (East Brunswick, NJ) and Camp Pontiac (Copake, NY), where his outstanding athletic talents were recognized, especially as a baseball infielder. While attending summer camp, the 14-year-old Auster witnessed what he called the &quot;seminal experience&quot; of his life: a boy being struck by lightning and dying instantly. The boy was standing a few inches away from him at the time. This event changed his life, thinking about it every day.

==Career==
After graduating from Columbia University with B.A. and M.A. degrees (English, Comparative Literature) in 1970, he moved to Paris where, among other jobs, he tried to earn a living translating French literature. After returning to the United States in 1974, he continued to work on his poems, essays, and translations of French writers, such as Stéphane Mallarmé and Joseph Joubert. His work as a translator led to the publication in 1982 of &quot;The Random House Book of Twentieth-Century French Poetry&quot;, which he edited.
Following the appearance in 1982 of his acclaimed debut work, a memoir titled &quot;The Invention of Solitude&quot;, Auster gained renown for a series of three loosely connected novellas published collectively as &quot;The New York Trilogy&quot; (1987), and is often cited as his most widely known work to the general reading public.

Although &quot;The New York Trilogy&quot; gives a nod to the detective genre, they are not conventional detective stories organized around solving mysteries. Rather, Auster uses the detective form to address questions of identity, space, language, and literature, creating his own distinctively postmodern form in the process. Auster disagrees with this analysis, because he believes that &quot;the &quot;Trilogy&quot; grows directly out of &quot;The Invention of Solitude&quot;.

Similar to the themes explored in &quot;The New York Trilogy&quot;, the search for identity and personal meaning continued to permeate the three novels Auster published in quick succession in the late 1980s. Whether writing about the relationships between people caught in the flux of an uncertain future and uncertain identity (&quot;In the Country of Last Things&quot; [1987] and &quot;Moon Palace&quot; [1989]), or the role of coincidence and random events in our lives (&quot;The Music of Chance&quot; [1990]), Auster was steadily increasing his readership and popularity.

During the 1990s Auster published three more novels, but he increasingly turned his attention to script writing and filmmaking by way of his screenplay and directorial collaborations with Wayne Wang on &quot;Smoke&quot; (which won Auster the Independent Spirit Award for Best First Screenplay) and &quot;Blue in the Face&quot;. He also directed the movie Lulu on the Bridge (1998).

After a steadfast commitment to filmmaking during the late 1990s, Auster decided to turn his attention once again to writing novels, memoirs, and essays during the remaining two decades of his life. Between 2002 and 2024, Auster published nine novels, two memoirs, an 800-page biography of Stephen Crane (&quot;Burning Boy&quot;), and a sustained jeremiad (Auster calls it a &quot;political pamphlet&quot;) on the long, unending history of gun violence in America (&quot;Bloodbath Nation&quot;). Eight of the final ten novels Auster published during his lifetime (from 1999 to 2023) received nominations for the International Dublin Award, and Auster&#x27;s 2017 novel &quot;4 3 2 1&quot; was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.

Auster was on the PEN American Center board of trustees from 2004 to 2009 and its vice president from 2005 through 2007.

In 2012, Auster said in an interview that he would not visit Turkey, in protest at its treatment of journalists. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan replied: &quot;As if we need you! Who cares if you come, or not?&quot; Auster responded: &quot;According to the latest numbers gathered by International PEN, there are nearly one hundred writers imprisoned in Turkey, not to speak of independent publishers such as Ragıp Zarakolu, whose case is being closely watched by PEN Centers around the world.&quot;

Auster was willing to give Iranian translators permission to write Persian versions of his works in exchange for a small fee; Iran does not recognize international copyright laws.

One of Auster&#x27;s later books, &quot;A Life in Words,&quot; was published in October 2017 by Seven Stories Press. It brought together two years of conversations with the Danish scholar I.B. Siegumfeldt about each of Auster&#x27;s fiction and non-fiction works. It has been a primary source for understanding Auster&#x27;s approach to his works.

==Reception==
&quot;Over the past twenty-five years&quot;, wrote Michael Dirda in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; in 2008, &quot;Paul Auster has established one of the most distinctive niches in contemporary literature&quot;. Dirda extolled his virtues in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, attesting that Auster had &quot;perfected a limpid, confessional style&quot; and constructed suspenseful, sometimes autobiographical plots. His heroes operated in a world that appeared familiar but they confronted &quot;vague menace and possible hallucination.&quot;

Writing about Auster&#x27;s 2017 novel &quot;4 3 2 1&quot;, &quot;Booklist&quot; critic Donna Seaman remarked that Auster went beyond conventions of storytelling and mixed genres, even crossing over into filmic modes. She praised the complex sense of wonder and gratitude in his works, which often features &quot;sly humor&quot; in an oeuvre which she considered &quot;a grand experiment, not only in storytelling, but also in the endless nature-versus-nurture debate, the perpetual dance between inheritance and free will, intention and chance, dreams and fate. This elaborate investigation into the big what-if is also a mesmerizing dramatization of the multitude of clashing selves we each harbor within.&quot;

The English critic James Wood criticized Auster for what he considered &quot;borrowed language&quot; and &quot;bogus dialogue&quot;, nonetheless conceding that Auster was &quot;probably America&#x27;s best-known postmodern novelist&quot;. He noted: &quot;One reads Auster&#x27;s novels very fast, because they are lucidly written, because the grammar of the prose is the grammar of the most familiar realism (the kind that is, in fact, comfortingly artificial), and because the plots, full of sneaky turns and surprises and violent irruptions, have what the &quot;Times&quot; once called &#x27;all the suspense and pace of a bestselling thriller&#x27;.&quot;

==Personal life and death==
Auster&#x27;s first marriage was to the writer Lydia Davis in 1974. They had one child together, their son Daniel Auster. By 1979 they were separated and were divorced in 1981. In 1981, Auster married his second wife, writer Siri Hustvedt, the daughter of professor and scholar Lloyd Hustvedt. They lived in Brooklyn and had one daughter, Sophie Auster, a singer.

Daniel Auster was arrested on April 16, 2022, and charged with manslaughter and negligent homicide in the death of his 10-month-old infant daughter Ruby, who consumed some of the heroin and fentanyl he was using. Ruby had died five months previously, on November 1, 2021. At the time of the arrest, police remained unclear about how the baby could have ingested the drugs while lying beside her father when he was napping.

On April 26, 2022, Daniel Auster died from an overdose. Daniel Auster was also known for his association with the Club Kids and their ringleader Michael Alig, and was present during the killing of fellow Club Kid Andre Melendez. 

Paul Auster characterized his politics as &quot;far to the left of the Democratic Party&quot;, but said he voted Democratic because he doubted a socialist candidate could win. He described right-wing Republicans as &quot;jihadists&quot;, and the election of Donald Trump as &quot;the most appalling thing I&#x27;ve seen in politics in my life&quot;.

On March 11, 2023, Auster&#x27;s wife Siri Hustvedt revealed on Instagram that he had been diagnosed with cancer in December 2022, and that he had been treated at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York since then.

Paul Auster died of complications from lung cancer at his home in Brooklyn, on April 30, 2024, at the age of 77. He was survived by his wife Siri Hustvedt, their daughter Sophie Auster, his sister Janet Auster, and a grandson.

==Other media==
* In 1993, a movie adaptation of &quot;The Music of Chance&quot; was released. Auster features in a cameo role at the end of the film.
* In 1994 &quot;City of Glass&quot; was adapted as a graphic novel by artist David Mazzucchelli and Paul Karasik. Auster&#x27;s close friend, noted cartoonist Art Spiegelman, produced the adaptation.
* In 1998, Auster was the executive producer on the short film &quot;I Remember&quot; from filmmaker Avi Zev Weider, who adapted it from Joe Brainard’s book I Remember.
* From 1999 to 2001, Auster was part of NPR&#x27;s &quot;National Story Project&quot;, a monthly radio show in which, together With NPR correspondent Jacki Lyden, Auster read stories sent in by NPR listeners across America. Listeners were invited to send in stories of &quot;anywhere from two paragraphs to two pages&quot; that &quot;must be true&quot;, from which Auster later selected entries, edited them and subsequently read them on the air. Auster read over 4,000 stories submitted to the show, with a few dozen eventually featured on the show and many more anthologized in two 2002 books edited by Auster.
* Jazz trumpeter and composer Michael Mantler&#x27;s 2001 album &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; borrows the words and language from Auster&#x27;s short play &quot;Hide and Seek,&quot; which Mantler found in Auster&#x27;s &quot;Hand to Mouth.&quot;
*Don Delillo‘s 2003 novel Cosmopolis is dedicated to Auster.
* Auster narrated &quot;Ground Zero&quot; (2004), an audio guide created by the Kitchen Sisters (Davia Nelson and Nikki Silva) and Soundwalk and produced by NPR, which won the Dalton Pen Award for Multi-media/Audio (2005), and was nominated for an Audie Award for best Original Work (2005).
* Austrian composer Olga Neuwirth&#x27;s composition &quot; ... ce qui arrive ... &quot; (2004) combines the recorded voice of Paul Auster reading from his books &quot;Hand to Mouth&quot; and &quot;The Red Notebook&quot;, either as straight recitation, integrated with other sounds as if in a radio play, or passed through an electronically realized string resonator so that the low tones interact with those of a string ensemble. A video by Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster runs throughout the work featuring the cabaret artist and actress Georgette Dee.
* In 2005 his daughter, Sophie, recorded an album of songs in both French and English, entitled &quot;Sophie Auster&quot;, with the band One Ring Zero, which included a few songs that her father provided the lyrics for.
* Auster&#x27;s voice may be heard on the 2005 album entitled &quot;We Must Be Losing It&quot; by The Farangs. The two tracks are entitled &quot;Obituary in the Present Tense&quot; and &quot;Between the Lines&quot;.
* In 2006 Auster directed the film &quot;The Inner Life of Martin Frost&quot;, based on an original screenplay by him. It was shot in Lisbon and Azenhas do Mar and starred David Thewlis, Iréne Jacob, and Michael Imperioli as well as Auster&#x27;s daughter Sophie. Auster provided the narration, albeit uncredited. The film premiered at the European Film Market, as part of the 2007 Berlinale in Berlin, Germany on February 10, 2007, and opened in New York City on September 7 of the same year.
* The lyrics of Fionn Regan&#x27;s 2006 song &quot;Put A Penny in the Slot&quot; mention Auster and his novella &quot;Timbuktu&quot;.
* In the 2008 novel &quot;To the End of the Land&quot; by David Grossman, the bedroom bookshelf of the central IDF soldier character Ofer is described as prominently displaying several Auster titles.
* In the 2009 documentary &quot;Act of God&quot;, Auster is interviewed on his experience of watching another boy struck and killed by lightning when he was 14.
* In the 2011 documentary on Charlotte Rampling &quot;The Look&quot;, Auster meditates on beauty with Rampling on his moored tug boat on the Hudson River.

<doc id="25030" wikidata="Q1145976" url="?curid=25030" title="Plain text">
<text>In computing, plain text is a loose term for data (e.g. file contents) that represent only characters of readable material but not its graphical representation nor other objects (floating-point numbers, images, etc.). It may also include a limited number of &quot;whitespace&quot; characters that affect simple arrangement of text, such as spaces, line breaks, or tabulation characters. Plain text is different from formatted text, where style information is included; from structured text, where structural parts of the document such as paragraphs, sections, and the like are identified; and from binary files in which some portions must be interpreted as binary objects (encoded integers, real numbers, images, etc.).

The term is sometimes used quite loosely, to mean files that contain &quot;only&quot; &quot;readable&quot; content (or just files with nothing that the speaker does not prefer). For example, that could exclude any indication of fonts or layout (such as markup, markdown, or even tabs); characters such as curly quotes, non-breaking spaces, soft hyphens, em dashes, and/or ligatures; or other things.

In principle, plain text can be in any encoding, but occasionally the term is taken to imply ASCII. As Unicode-based encodings such as UTF-8 and UTF-16 become more common, that usage may be shrinking.

Plain text is also sometimes used only to exclude &quot;binary&quot; files: those in which at least some parts of the file cannot be correctly interpreted via the character encoding in effect. For example, a file or string consisting of &quot;hello&quot; (in any encoding), following by 4 bytes that express a binary integer that is &quot;not&quot; a character, is a binary file. Converting a plain text file to a different character encoding does not change the meaning of the text, as long as the correct character encoding is used. However, converting a binary file to a different format may alter the interpretation of the non-textual data.

== Plain text and rich text ==
According to The Unicode Standard:
* &quot;Plain text is a pure sequence of character codes; plain Un-encoded text is therefore a sequence of Unicode character codes.
* In contrast, &quot;styled text&quot;, also known as &quot;rich text&quot;, is any text representation containing plain text plus added information such as a language identifier, font size, color, hypertext links, and so on.
* SGML, RTF, HTML, XML, and TeX are examples of rich text fully represented as plain text streams, interspersing plain text data with sequences of characters that represent the additional data structures.&quot;

According to other definitions, however, files that contain markup or other meta-data are generally considered plain text, so long as the markup is also in a directly human-readable form (as in HTML, XML, and so on). Thus, representations such as SGML, RTF, HTML, XML, wiki markup, and TeX, as well as nearly all programming language source code files, are considered plain text. The particular content is irrelevant to whether a file is plain text. For example, an SVG file can express drawings or even bitmapped graphics, but is still plain text.

The use of plain text rather than binary files enables files to survive much better &quot;in the wild&quot;, in part by making them largely immune to computer architecture incompatibilities. For example, all the problems of Endianness can be avoided (with encodings such as UCS-2 rather than UTF-8, endianness matters, but uniformly for every character, rather than for potentially-unknown subsets of it).

==Usage==

The purpose of using plain text today is primarily independence from programs that require their very own special encoding or formatting or file format. Plain text files can be opened, read, and edited with ubiquitous text editors and utilities.

A command-line interface allows people to give commands in plain text and get a response, also typically in plain text.

Many other computer programs are also capable of processing or creating plain text, such as countless programs in DOS, Windows, classic Mac OS, and Unix and its kin; as well as web browsers (a few browsers such as Lynx and the Line Mode Browser produce only plain text for display) and other e-text readers.

Plain text files are almost universal in programming; a source code file containing instructions in a programming language is almost always a plain text file. Plain text is also commonly used for configuration files, which are read for saved settings at the startup of a program.

Plain text is used for much e-mail.

A comment, a &quot;.txt&quot; file, or a TXT Record generally contains only plain text (without formatting) intended for humans to read.

The best format for storing knowledge persistently is plain text, rather than some binary format.

==Encoding==

===Character encodings===

Before the early 1960s, computers were mainly used for number-crunching rather than for text, and memory was extremely expensive. Computers often allocated only 6 bits for each character, permitting only 64 characters—assigning codes for A-Z, a-z, and 0-9 would leave only 2 codes: nowhere near enough. Most computers opted not to support lower-case letters. Thus, early text projects such as Roberto Busa&#x27;s Index Thomisticus, the Brown Corpus, and others had to resort to conventions such as keying an asterisk preceding letters actually intended to be upper-case.

Fred Brooks of IBM argued strongly for going to 8-bit bytes, because someday people might want to process text, and won. Although IBM used EBCDIC, most text from then on came to be encoded in ASCII, using values from 0 to 31 for (non-printing) control characters, and values from 32 to 127 for graphic characters such as letters, digits, and punctuation. Most machines stored characters in 8 bits rather than 7, ignoring the remaining bit or using it as a checksum.

The near-ubiquity of ASCII was a great help, but failed to address international and linguistic concerns. The dollar-sign (&quot;$&quot;) was not as useful in England, and the accented characters used in Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Italian and many other languages were entirely unavailable in ASCII (not to mention characters used in Greek, Russian, and most Eastern languages). Many individuals, companies, and countries defined extra characters as needed—often reassigning control characters, or using values in the range from 128 to 255. Using values above 128 conflicts with using the 8th bit as a checksum, but the checksum usage gradually died out.

These additional characters were encoded differently in different countries, making texts impossible to decode without figuring out the originator&#x27;s rules. For instance, a browser might display ¬A rather than ` if it tried to interpret one character set as another. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) eventually developed several code pages under ISO 8859, to accommodate various languages. The first of these (ISO 8859-1) is also known as &quot;Latin-1&quot;, and covers the needs of most (not all) European languages that use Latin-based characters (there was not quite enough room to cover them all). ISO 2022 then provided conventions for &quot;switching&quot; between different character sets in mid-file. Many other organisations developed variations on these, and for many years Windows and Macintosh computers used incompatible variations.

The text-encoding situation became more and more complex, leading to efforts by ISO and by the Unicode Consortium to develop a single, unified character encoding that could cover all known (or at least all currently known) languages. After some conflict, these efforts were unified. Unicode currently allows for 1,114,112 code values, and assigns codes covering nearly all modern text writing systems, as well as many historical ones, and for many non-linguistic characters such as printer&#x27;s dingbats, mathematical symbols, etc.

Text is considered plain text regardless of its encoding. To properly understand or process it the recipient must know (or be able to figure out) what encoding was used; however, they need not know anything about the computer architecture that was used, or about the binary structures defined by whatever program (if any) created the data.

Perhaps the most common way of explicitly stating the specific encoding of plain text is with a MIME type.
For email and HTTP, the default MIME type is &quot;text/plain&quot; -- plain text without markup.
Another MIME type often used in both email and HTTP is &quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot; -- plain text represented using the UTF-8 character encoding with HTML markup.
Another common MIME type is &quot;application/json&quot; -- plain text represented using the UTF-8 character encoding with JSON markup.

When a document is received without any explicit indication of the character encoding, some applications use charset detection to attempt to guess what encoding was used.

===Control codes===

ASCII reserves the first 32 codes (numbers 0–31 decimal) for control characters known as the &quot;C0 set&quot;: codes originally intended not to represent printable information, but rather to control devices (such as printers) that make use of ASCII, or to provide meta-information about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape. They include common characters like the newline and the tab character.

In 8-bit character sets such as Latin-1 and the other ISO 8859 sets, the first 32 characters of the &quot;upper half&quot; (128 to 159) are also control codes, known as the &quot;C1 set&quot;. They are rarely used directly; when they turn up in documents which are ostensibly in an ISO 8859 encoding, their code positions generally refer instead to the characters at that position in a proprietary, system-specific encoding, such as Windows-1252 or Mac OS Roman, that use the codes to instead provide additional graphic characters.

Unicode defines additional control characters, including bi-directional text direction override characters (used to explicitly mark right-to-left writing inside left-to-right writing and the other way around) and variation selectors to select alternate forms of CJK ideographs, emoji and other characters.

<text>The Presbyterian Church (USA), abbreviated PCUSA, is a mainline Protestant denomination in the United States. It is the largest Presbyterian denomination in the country, known for its liberal stance on doctrine and its ordaining of women and members of the LGBT community as elders and ministers. The Presbyterian Church (USA) was established with the 1983 merger of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, whose churches were located in the Southern and border states, with the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America, whose congregations could be found in every state.

The church maintains a Book of Confessions, a collection of historic and contemporary creeds and catechisms, including its own Brief Statement of Faith. It is a member the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The similarly named Presbyterian Church in America (PCA) is a separate denomination whose congregations can also trace their history to the various schisms and mergers of Presbyterian churches in the United States. Unlike the more conservative Presbyterian Church in America, the Presbyterian Church (USA) supports the ordination of women and affirms same-sex marriages. It also welcomes practicing gay and lesbian persons to serve in leadership positions as ministers, deacons, elders, and trustees.

The Presbyterian Church (USA) is the largest Presbyterian denomination in the United States, reporting 1,094,733 active members and 17,978 ordained ministers (including retired ones) in 8,572 congregations at the end of 2023. This number does not include members who are baptized but not confirmed, or the inactive members also affiliated. For example, in 2005, the Presbyterian Church (USA) claimed 318,291 baptized but not confirmed members and nearly 500,000 inactive members in addition to active members. Its membership has been steadily declining over the past several decades; the trend has significantly accelerated in recent years, partly due to breakaway congregations. Average denominational worship attendance dropped from 748,774 in 2013 to 445,414 in 2023.

Summary membership statistics for 2023 are based on only 65% of churches reporting; for non-reporting churches, the last-reported membership figure is used. Reported membership based on gender: 904,780; based on age: 892,107. 

The gender membership demographics show an anomalous 5% increase in men from 348,231 in 2022 to 365,632 in 2023, despite total membership decreasing by 4%. This supposed increase in men was initially reported as a notable area of growth and a reason for hope, but that claim has since been removed. The church-trends database, and the corrected 2023 GA Minutes, show 384,231 male members in 2022, differing by transposing two digits, which is in line with the 4% total membership decrease from 2022 to 2023.

==History==
===Origins===
Presbyterians trace their history to the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century. The Presbyterian heritage, and much of its theology, began with the French theologian and lawyer John Calvin (1509–1564), whose writings solidified much of the Reformed tradition that came before him in the form of the sermons and writings of Huldrych Zwingli. From Calvin&#x27;s headquarters in Geneva, the Reformed movement spread to other parts of Europe. John Knox, a former Roman Catholic priest from Scotland who studied with Calvin in Geneva, took Calvin&#x27;s teachings back to Scotland and led the Scottish Reformation of 1560. Because of this reform movement, the Church of Scotland embraced Reformed theology and presbyterian polity. The Ulster Scots brought their Presbyterian faith with them to Ireland, where they laid the foundation of what would become the Presbyterian Church in Ireland.

Immigrants from Scotland and Ireland brought Presbyterianism to North America as early as 1640, and immigration would remain a large source of growth throughout the colonial era. Another source of growth were a number of New England Puritans who left the Congregational churches because they preferred presbyterian polity. In 1706, seven ministers led by Francis Makemie established the first American presbytery at Philadelphia in the Province of Pennsylvania, which was followed by the creation of the Synod of Philadelphia in 1717.

The First Great Awakening and the revivalism it generated had a major impact on American Presbyterians. Ministers such as William and Gilbert Tennent, a friend of George Whitefield, emphasized the necessity of a conscious conversion experience and pushed for higher moral standards among the clergy. Disagreements over revivalism, itinerant preaching, and educational requirements for clergy led to a division known as the Old Side–New Side Controversy that lasted from 1741 to 1758.

In the South, the Presbyterians were evangelical dissenters, mostly Scotch-Irish, who expanded into Virginia between 1740 and 1758. Spangler in &quot;Virginians Reborn: Anglican Monopoly, Evangelical Dissent, and the Rise of the Baptists in the Late Eighteenth Century&quot; (2008) argues they were more energetic and held frequent services better attuned to the frontier conditions of the colony. Presbyterianism grew in frontier areas where the Anglicans had made little impression. Uneducated whites and blacks were attracted to the emotional worship of the denomination, its emphasis on biblical simplicity, and its psalm singing.

Some local Presbyterian churches, such as Briery in Prince Edward County, owned slaves. The Briery church purchased five slaves in 1766 and raised money for church expenses by hiring them out to local planters.

After the United States achieved independence from Great Britain, Presbyterian leaders felt that a national Presbyterian denomination was needed, and the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (PCUSA) was organized. The first general assembly was held in Philadelphia in 1789. John Witherspoon, president of Princeton University and the only minister to sign the Declaration of Independence, was the first moderator.

Not all American Presbyterians participated in the creation of the PCUSA General Assembly because the divisions then occurring in the Church of Scotland were replicated in America. In 1751, Scottish Covenanters began sending ministers to America, and the Seceders were doing the same by 1753. In 1858, the majority of Covenanters and Seceders merged to create the United Presbyterian Church of North America (UPCNA).

===19th century===
In the decades after independence many American Protestants, including Calvinists (Presbyterians and Congregationalists), Methodists, and Baptists, were swept up in Christian revivals that would later become known as the Second Great Awakening. Presbyterians also helped to shape voluntary societies that encouraged educational, missionary, evangelical, and reforming work. As its influence grew, many non-Presbyterians feared that the PCUSA&#x27;s informal influence over American life might effectively make it an established church.

The Second Great Awakening divided the PCUSA over revivalism and fear that revivalism was leading to an embrace of Arminian theology. In 1810, frontier revivalists split from the PCUSA and organized the Cumberland Presbyterian Church. Throughout the 1820s, support and opposition to revivalism hardened into well-defined factions, the New School and Old School respectively. By the 1838, the Old School–New School Controversy had divided the PCUSA. There were now two general assemblies each claiming to represent the PCUSA.

In 1858, the New School split along sectional lines when its Southern synods and presbyteries established the pro-slavery United Synod of the Presbyterian Church. Old School Presbyterians followed in 1861 after the start of hostilities in the American Civil War with the formation of the Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America. The Presbyterian Church in the CSA absorbed the smaller United Synod in 1864. After the war, this body was renamed the Presbyterian Church in the United States (PCUS) and was commonly nicknamed the &quot;Southern Presbyterian Church&quot; throughout its history. In 1869, the northern PCUSA&#x27;s Old School and New School factions reunited as well and was known as the &quot;Northern Presbyterian Church&quot;.

===20th century to the present===


The early part of the 20th century saw continued growth in both major sections of the church. It also saw the growth of Fundamentalist Christianity (a movement of those who believed in the literal interpretation of the Bible as the fundamental source of the religion) as distinguished from Modernist Christianity (a movement holding the belief that Christianity needed to be re-interpreted in light of modern scientific theories such as evolution or the rise of degraded social conditions brought on by industrialization and urbanization).

Open controversy was sparked in 1922, when Harry Emerson Fosdick, a modernist and a Baptist pastoring a PCUSA congregation in New York City, preached a sermon entitled &quot;Shall the Fundamentalists Win?&quot; The crisis reached a head the following year when, in response to the New York Presbytery&#x27;s decision to ordain a couple of men who could not affirm the virgin birth, the PCUSA&#x27;s General Assembly reaffirmed the &quot;five fundamentals&quot;: the deity of Christ, the Virgin Birth, the vicarious atonement, the inerrancy of Scripture, and Christ&#x27;s miracles and resurrection. This move against modernism caused a backlash in the form of the &quot;Auburn Affirmation&quot; — a document embracing liberalism and modernism. The liberals began a series of ecclesiastical trials of their opponents, expelled them from the church and seized their church buildings. Under the leadership of J. Gresham Machen, a former Princeton Theological Seminary New Testament professor who had founded Westminster Theological Seminary in 1929, and who was a PCUSA minister, many of these conservatives would establish what became known as the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1936. Although the 1930s and 1940s and the ensuing neo-orthodox theological consensus mitigated much of the polemics during the mid-20th century, disputes erupted again beginning in the mid-1960s over the extent of involvement in the civil rights movement and the issue of ordination of women, and, especially since the 1990s, over the issue of ordination of homosexuals.

====Mergers====

The Presbyterian Church in the United States of America was joined by the majority of the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, mostly congregations in the border and Southern states, in 1906. In 1920, it absorbed the Welsh Calvinist Methodist Church. The United Presbyterian Church of North America merged with the PCUSA in 1958 to form the United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America (UPCUSA).

Under Eugene Carson Blake, the UPCUSA&#x27;s stated clerk, the denomination entered into a period of social activism and ecumenical endeavors, which culminated in the development of the Confession of 1967 which was the church&#x27;s first new confession of faith in three centuries. The 170th General Assembly in 1958 authorized a committee to develop a brief contemporary statement of faith. The 177th General Assembly in 1965 considered and amended the draft confession and sent a revised version for general discussion within the church. The 178th General Assembly in 1966 accepted a revised draft and sent it to presbyteries throughout the church for final ratification. As the confession was ratified by more than 90% of all presbyteries, the 178th General Assembly adopted it in 1967. The UPCUSA also adopted a &quot;Book of Confessions&quot; in 1967, which would include the Confession of 1967, the Westminster Confession and Westminster Shorter Catechism, the Heidelberg Catechism, the Second Helvetic and Scots Confessions and the Barmen Declaration.

An attempt to reunite the United Presbyterian Church in the USA with the Presbyterian Church in the United States in the late 1950s failed when the latter church was unwilling to accept ecclesiastical centralization. In the meantime, a conservative group broke away from the Presbyterian Church in the United States in 1973, mainly over the issues of women&#x27;s ordination and a perceived drift toward theological liberalism. This group formed the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA).

Attempts at union between the churches (UPCUSA and PCUS) were renewed in the 1970s, culminating in the merger of the two churches to form the Presbyterian Church (USA) on June 10, 1983. At the time of the merger, the churches had a combined membership of 3,121,238. Many of the efforts were spearheaded by the financial and outspoken activism of retired businessman Thomas Clinton who died two years before the merger. A new national headquarters was established in Louisville, Kentucky in 1988 replacing the headquarters of the UPCUSA in New York City and the PCUS located in Atlanta, Georgia.

The merger essentially consolidated moderate-to-liberal American Presbyterians into one body. Other US Presbyterian bodies (the Cumberland Presbyterians being a partial exception) place greater emphasis on doctrinal Calvinism, literalist hermeneutics, and conservative politics.

For the most part, PC(USA) Presbyterians, not unlike similar mainline traditions such as the Episcopal Church and the United Church of Christ, are fairly progressive on matters such as doctrine, environmental issues, sexual morality, and economic issues, though the denomination remains divided and conflicted on these issues. Like other mainline denominations, the PC(USA) has also seen a great deal of demographic aging, with fewer new members and declining membership since 1967.

====Social justice initiatives and renewal movements====

In the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s, the General Assembly of PC(USA) adopted several social justice initiatives, which covered a range of topics including: stewardship of God&#x27;s creation, world hunger, homelessness, and LGBT issues. As of 2011 the PC(USA) no longer excludes Partnered Gay and Lesbian ministers from the ministry. Previously, the PC(USA) required its ministers to remain &quot;&quot;chastely in singleness or with fidelity in marriage&quot;.&quot; Currently, the PC(USA) permits teaching elders to perform same-gender marriages. On a congregational basis, individual sessions (congregational governing bodies) may choose to permit same-gender marriages.

These changes have led to several renewal movements and denominational splinters. Some conservative-minded groups in the PC(USA), such as the Confessing Movement and the Presbyterian Lay Committee (formed in the mid-1960s) have remained in the main body, rather than leaving to form new, break-away groups.

====Breakaway Presbyterian denominations====
Several Presbyterian denominations have split from PC(USA) or its predecessors over the years. For example, the Orthodox Presbyterian Church broke away from the Presbyterian Church in the USA in 1936.

More recently formed Presbyterian denominations have attracted PC(USA) congregations disenchanted with the direction of the denomination, but wishing to continue in a Reformed, Presbyterian denomination. The Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), which does not allow ordained female clergy, separated from Presbyterian Church in the United States in 1973 and has subsequently become the second largest Presbyterian denomination in the United States. The Evangelical Presbyterian Church (EPC), which gives local presbyteries the option of allowing ordained female pastors, broke away from the United Presbyterian Church and incorporated in 1981. A PC(USA) renewal movement, Fellowship of Presbyterians (FOP) (now The Fellowship Community), held several national conferences serving disaffecting Presbyterians. FOP&#x27;s organizing efforts culminated with the founding of (ECO), a new Presbyterian denomination that allows ordination of women but is more conservative theologically than PC(USA).

In 2013 the presbyteries ratified the General Assembly&#x27;s 2012 vote to allow the ordination of openly gay persons to the ministry and in 2014 the General Assembly voted to amend the church&#x27;s constitution to define marriage as the union of two persons instead of the union of a man and woman, which was ratified (by the presbyteries) in 2015. This has led to the departure of several hundred congregations. The majority of churches leaving the Presbyterian Church (USA) have chosen to join other denominations such as the Evangelical Presbyterian Church or ECO. Few have chosen to join the larger more conservative Presbyterian Church in America, which does not permit female clergy.

====Youth====
Since 1983 the Presbyterian Youth Triennium has been held every three years at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, US, and is open to Presbyterian high school students throughout the world. The very first Youth Triennium was held in 1980 at Indiana University and the conference for teens is an effort of the Presbyterian Church (USA), the largest Presbyterian denomination in the nation; Cumberland Presbyterian Church; and Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America, the first African-American denomination to embrace Presbyterianism in the reformed tradition.

Since 1907, Montreat, North Carolina has hosted a youth conference every year. In 1983, Montreat Conference Center became a National Conference Center of the PC(USA) when the northern and southern denominational churches reunited.

==Structure==

===Constitution===
The Constitution of PC(USA) is composed of two portions: Part I, the &quot;Book of Confessions&quot; and Part II, the &quot;Book of Order&quot;. The &quot;Book of Confessions&quot; outlines the beliefs of the PC(USA) by declaring the creeds by which the Church&#x27;s leaders are instructed and led. Complementing that is the &quot;Book of Order&quot; which gives the rationale and description for the organization and function of the Church at all levels. The &quot;Book of Order&quot; is currently divided into four sections – 1) The Foundations of Presbyterian Polity 2) The Form of Government, 3) The Directory For Worship, and 4) The Rules of Discipline.

===Councils===


The Presbyterian Church (USA) has a representative form of government, known as presbyterian polity, with four levels of government and administration, as outlined in the &quot;Book of Order&quot;. The councils (governing bodies) are as follows: 
# Session (of a Congregation)
# Presbytery
# Synod
# General Assembly

====Session====
At the congregational level, the governing body is called the &quot;session&quot;, from the Latin word &quot;sessio&quot;, meaning &quot;a sitting&quot;. The session is made up of the pastors of the church and all elders elected and installed to active service. Following a pattern set in the first congregation of Christians in Jerusalem described in the Book of Acts in the New Testament, the church is governed by &quot;presbyters&quot; (a term and category that includes elders and Ministers of Word and Sacrament, historically also referred to as &quot;ruling or canon elders&quot; because they &quot;measure&quot; the spiritual life and work of a congregation and ministers as &quot;teaching elders&quot;).

The elders are nominated by a nominating committee of the congregation; in addition, nominations from the floor are permissible. Elders are then elected by the congregation. All elders elected to serve on the congregation&#x27;s session of elders are required to undergo a period of study and preparation for this order of ministry, after which the session examines the elders-elect as to their personal faith; knowledge of doctrine, government, and discipline contained in the Constitution of the church, and the duties of the office of elder. If the examination is approved, the session appoints a day for the service of ordination and installation. Session meetings are normally moderated by a called and installed pastor and minutes are recorded by a clerk, who is also an ordained presbyter. If the congregation does not have an installed pastor, the Presbytery appoints a minister member or elected member of the presbytery as moderator with the concurrence of the local church session. The moderator presides over the session as first among equals and also serves as a &quot;liturgical&quot; bishop over the ordination and installation of elders and deacons within a particular congregation.

The session guides and directs the ministry of the local church, including almost all spiritual and fiduciary leadership. The congregation as a whole has only the responsibility to vote on: 1) the call of the pastor (subject to presbytery approval) and the terms of call (the church&#x27;s provision for compensating and caring for the pastor); 2) the election of its own officers (elders and deacons); 3) buying, mortgaging, or selling real property. All other church matters such as the budget, personnel matters, and all programs for spiritual life and mission, are the responsibility of the session. In addition, the session serves as an ecclesiastical court to consider disciplinary charges brought against church officers or members.

The session also oversees the work of the deacons, a second body of leaders also tracing its origins to the Book of Acts. The deacons are a congregational-level group whose duty is &quot;to minister to those who are in need, to the sick, to the friendless, and to any who may be in distress both within and beyond the community of faith.&quot; In some churches, the responsibilities of the deacons are taken care of by the session, so there is no board of deacons in that church. In some states, churches are legally incorporated and members or elders of the church serve as trustees of the corporation. However, &quot;the power and duties of such trustees shall not infringe upon the powers and duties of the Session or of the board of deacons.&quot; The deacons are a ministry board but not a governing body.

====Presbytery====
A &quot;presbytery&quot; is formed by all the congregations and the Ministers of Word and Sacrament in a geographic area together with elders selected (proportional to congregation size) from each of the congregations. Four special presbyteries are &quot;non-geographical&quot; in that they overlay other English-speaking presbyteries, though they are geographically limited to the boundaries of a particular synod (see below); it may be more accurate to refer to them as &quot;trans-geographical.&quot; Three PC(USA) synods have a non-geographical presbytery for Korean language Presbyterian congregations, and one synod has a non-geographical presbytery for Native American congregations, the Dakota Presbytery. There are currently 166 presbyteries for the 8,572 congregations in the PC(USA).

Only the presbytery (not a congregation, session, synod, or General Assembly) has the responsibility and authority to ordain church members to the ordered ministry of Word and Sacrament, also referred to as a Teaching Elder, to install ministers to (or remove them from) congregations as pastors, and to remove a minister from the ministry. A Presbyterian minister is a member of a presbytery. The General Assembly cannot ordain or remove a Teaching Elder, but the Office of the General Assembly does maintain and publish a national directory with the help of each presbytery&#x27;s stated clerk. This directory is also published bi-annually with the minutes of the General Assembly. A pastor cannot be a member of the congregation he or she serves as a pastor because his or her primary ecclesiastical accountability lies with the presbytery. Members of the congregation generally choose their own pastor with the assistance and support of the presbytery. The presbytery must approve the choice and officially install the pastor at the congregation, or approve the covenant for a temporary pastoral relationship. Additionally, the presbytery must approve if either the congregation or the pastor wishes to dissolve that pastoral relationship.

The presbytery has authority over many affairs of its local congregations. Only the presbytery can approve the establishment, dissolution, or merger of congregations. The presbytery also maintains a Permanent Judicial Commission, which acts as a court of appeal from sessions, and which exercises original jurisdiction in disciplinary cases against minister members of the presbytery.

A presbytery has two elected officers: a moderator and a stated clerk. The Moderator of the presbytery is elected annually and is either a minister member or an elder commissioner from one of the presbytery&#x27;s congregations. The Moderator presides at all presbytery assemblies and is the chief overseer at the ordination and installation of ministers in that presbytery. The stated clerk is the chief ecclesial officer and serves as the presbytery&#x27;s executive secretary and parliamentarian in accordance with the church Constitution and Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order. While the moderator of a presbytery normally serves one year, the stated clerk normally serves a designated number of years and may be re-elected indefinitely by the presbytery. Additionally, an Executive Presbyter (sometimes designated as General Presbyter, Pastor to Presbytery, Transitional Presbyter) is often elected as a staff person to care for the administrative duties of the presbytery, often with the additional role of a pastor to the pastors. Presbyteries may be creative in the designation and assignment of duties for their staff. A presbytery is required to elect a Moderator and a Clerk, but the practice of hiring staff is optional. Presbyteries must meet at least twice a year, but they have the discretion to meet more often and most do.

&quot;See &quot;Map of Presbyteries and Synods&quot;&quot;.

====Synod====
Presbyteries are organized within a geographical region to form a &quot;synod&quot;. Each synod contains at least three presbyteries, and its elected voting membership is to include both elders and Ministers of Word and Sacrament in equal numbers. Synods have various duties depending on the needs of the presbyteries they serve. In general, their responsibilities (G-12.0102) might be summarized as: developing and implementing the mission of the church throughout the region, facilitating communication between presbyteries and the General Assembly, and mediating conflicts between the churches and presbyteries. Every synod elects a Permanent Judicial Commission, which has original jurisdiction in remedial cases brought against its constituent presbyteries, and which also serves as an ecclesiastical court of appeal for decisions rendered by its presbyteries&#x27; Permanent Judicial Commissions. Synods are required to meet at least biennially. Meetings are moderated by an elected synod Moderator with support of the synod&#x27;s Stated Clerk. There are currently 16 synods in the PC(USA) and they vary widely in the scope and nature of their work. An ongoing current debate in the denomination is over the purpose, function, and need for synods.

====Synods of the Presbyterian Church (USA)====
* Synod of Alaska-Northwest
* Synod of Boriquen (Puerto Rico)
* Synod of the Covenant
* Synod of Lakes and Prairies
* Synod of Lincoln Trails
* Synod of Living Waters
* Synod of Mid-America
* Synod of Mid-Atlantic
* Synod of the Northeast
* Synod of the Pacific
* Synod of the Rocky Mountains
* Synod of South Atlantic
* Synod of Southern California and Hawaii
* Synod of the Southwest
* Synod of the Sun
* Synod of the Trinity

See also the List of Presbyterian Church (USA) synods and presbyteries.

====General Assembly====
The &quot;General Assembly&quot; is the highest governing body of the PC(USA). Until the 216th assembly met in Richmond, Virginia in 2004, the General Assembly met annually; since 2004, the General Assembly has met biennially in even-numbered years. It consists of commissioners elected by presbyteries (not synods), and its voting membership is proportioned with parity between elders and Ministers of Word and Sacrament. There are many important responsibilities of the General Assembly. Among them, &quot;The Book of Order&quot; lists these four:
# to set priorities for the work of the church in keeping with the church&#x27;s mission under Christ
# to develop overall objectives for mission and a comprehensive strategy to guide the church at every level of its life
# to provide the essential program functions that are appropriate for overall balance and diversity within the mission of the church, and
# to establish and administer national and worldwide ministries of witness, service, growth, and development.

=====Elected officials=====

The General Assembly elects a moderator at each assembly who moderates the rest of the sessions of that assembly meeting and continues to serve until the next assembly convenes (two years later) to elect a new moderator or co-moderator. Currently, the denomination is served by Co-Moderators Cecelia Armstrong and Anthony Larson, who were elected at the 226th General Assembly (2024). They followed Ruth Santana-Grace and Shavon Starling-Louis, elected in 2022. They followed Elona Street-Stewart and Gregory Bentley, elected in 2020. At the 223rd Assembly in St Louis, MO, Co-Moderators Vilmarie Cintrón-Olivieri and Cindy Kohmann were elected. See a complete listing of past moderators at another Wikipedia Article.

A Stated Clerk of the General Assembly is elected to one or more four-year terms and is responsible for the Office of the General Assembly which conducts the ecclesiastical work of the church. The Office of the General Assembly carries out most of the ecumenical functions and all of the constitutional functions at the Assembly. The Stated Clerks since reunion are: James E. Andrews (1984–1996), Clifton Kirkpatrick (1996–2008), Gradye Parsons (2008–2016), J. Herbert Nelson (2016–2023), Bronwen Boswell (2023–2024) (interim), and Jihyun Oh (2024–).

Bronwen Boswell was appointed Acting Stated Clerk in June 2023 to serve the remaining year of Nelson&#x27;s term. She was ineligible to apply for the stated clerk position in 2024, and has limited responsibilities focused primarily on completing plans for the 2024 GA and unification of the OGA and PMA. Her partial characterization of the attempted assassination of Donald Trump as &quot;two lives lost at a Pennsylvania rally&quot; blurs the distinction between perpetrator and victim, unlike definitions of mass shootings that often do not include the shooter in the body count. Bronwen&#x27;s political perspective on the shooting has been contrasted with purely nonpolitical perspectives from other denominations.

Jihyun Oh was installed in July 2024 as the Stated Clerk of the General Assembly, and promoted by the Unification Commission (UC) in October 2024 to lead the interim unified agency. The UC is overseeing unification of OGA and PMA, currently planned for summer of 2025. The Committee on the Office of the General Assembly (COGA) had oversight over the Stated Clerk and OGA, but COGA and PMAB were dissolved on December 31, 2024, with UC taking over their responsibilities. A new Unification Management Office is planned to manage the integration of PMA and OGA. In March 2024, the former OGA Communications Director was named PCUSA Communications Director and the former PMA Communications Director was named PMA Vision Integration &amp; Constituent Service Manager.

Nelson is the first African American to be elected to the office, and is a third-generation Presbyterian pastor. Nelson announced he would not seek re-election to a third term, and stepped down as Stated Clerk in June 2023, a year before his second term ended. Reported tensions that likely influenced the decision to resign include struggling efforts since 2016 to unify the OGA and PMA agencies, and struggling efforts to return to normal following the pandemic.

The Stated Clerk is also responsible for the records of the denomination, a function formalized in 1925 when the General Assembly created the &quot;Department of Historical Research and Conservation&quot; as part of the Office of the General Assembly. The current &quot;Department of History&quot; is also known as the Presbyterian Historical Society.

=====Structure=====
Six (now five) agencies carry out the work of the General Assembly, two of which (OGA and PMA) are being unified, with a new staff reporting structure that seems to imply that OGA and PMA have been dissolved. These are the Office of the General Assembly (OGA), the Presbyterian Publishing Corporation, the Presbyterian Investment and Loan Program, the Board of Pensions, the Presbyterian Foundation, and the Presbyterian Mission Agency (PMA) (formerly known as the General Assembly Mission Council).

The Board of Pensions is the oldest and largest of the PCUSA agencies, originally founded in 1717 as the Fund for Pious Uses. The Board provides those who work for congregations and affiliated ministries with healthcare, retirement, and income protection benefits. With over $12 billion in assets, the Board of Pensions is one of the largest Church Plans in the United States. The General Assembly directly elects the Board of Directors and the President. The current President is Frank Clark Spencer. In addition to its benefits program, the Board&#x27;s education department runs CREDO conferences, the PCUSA&#x27;s largest in service education program for ministers. The Board&#x27;s Assistance Program provides financial assistance in the form of income and housing supplements, emergency grants, and debt reduction to current and retired members based on need.

The Presbyterian Mission Agency Board (PMAB) (formerly General Assembly Mission Council) was dissolved on December 31, 2024, by a motion approved at a specially called Unification Commission meeting on August 16, two days ahead of the planned PMAB annual retreat. The timing of this motion allowed PMAB to celebrate their work in person, as their only remaining meeting, scheduled for October 29–30, 2024, was not in-person. The PMAB had 30 members (20 voting; 10 non-voting). The role of PMA President and Executive Director was phased out, effective October 10–31, 2024, with both PMA and OGA staff now reporting to the Rev. Jihyun Oh, who has been named as Stated Clerk of the General Assembly and Executive Director of the Interim Unified Agency (IUA). The announcement did not include any comment from the PMA President and Executive Director, or even any indication that she had been notified of the changes and agreed with the terms. Details of the IUA leadership selection process have not been disclosed. The constitution requires maintaining an office of the Stated Clerk (Book of Order G–3.0501c), but not an office of the PMA Executive Director. The 2025 and 2026 budgets (page 18), approved by GA in July 2024, fund the office of the PMA Executive Director at $4,524,347 and $4,613,383, respectively. 

The budget (page 26) anticipated proposing a $5 million reduction over 2 years at the Unification Commission&#x27;s October 2024 meeting in order to balance. At this meeting, the UC announced informally that the budget had been scrubbed resulting in a planned small reduction in force. On November 5, Jihyun Oh announced various program reconfigurations that would balance the 2025 and 2026 budgets, including the planned $5 million reduction. Further details were announced on November 13, including 12 layoffs, and two vacant OGA positions to remain unfilled. The November 5 announcement had also warned of further layoffs anticipated in 2025 related to restructuring. On February 5, 2024, Jihyun Oh announced 35 additional layoffs, where &quot;all World Mission staff positions will be revised, and some will be concluded,&quot; reducing staff from 79 to 44 in new roles as Global Ecumenical Liaisons.

These layoffs were intended to &quot;help us be more nimble in responding to the ongoing shifts in the world and in the church while continuing to foster deeper and broader relationships with faith communities worldwide,&quot; based on &quot;forecasting with the help of actuarial consultants for five years&quot; to prevent &quot;a bigger crisis in the near future&quot;. PC(USA) faces a backlash over the layoffs from critics who note that the 2024 General Assembly called for retaining mission co-workers and funded their budget at 60. On February 7, the Rev. Mienda Uriarte, director of World Mission, explained that &quot;the redesign aims to harmonize compensation and eliminate perceived inequity, thereby enhancing our organizational coherence and employee morale.&quot;

Previously, the General Assembly had elected the executive director of the Presbyterian Mission Agency, as the top administrator overseeing the mission work of the PC(USA). Past Executive Director of the PMA is Ruling Elder Linda Bryant Valentine(2006–2015), and Interim RE Tony De La Rosa. Elected in 2018 is Teaching Elder Diane Givens Moffett (2018–2024).

The General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission (GAPJC) is the highest Church court of the denomination. It is composed of one member elected by the General Assembly from each of its constituent synods (16). It has ultimate appellate jurisdiction over all Synod Permanent Judicial Commission cases involving issues of Church Constitution, and original jurisdiction over a small range of cases. The General Assembly Permanent Judicial Commission issues Authoritative Interpretations of The Constitution of the Presbyterian Church (USA) through its decisions.

===Affiliated seminaries===
The denomination maintains affiliations with ten seminaries in the United States. These are:
* Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Austin, Texas
* Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Georgia
* Johnson C. Smith Theological Seminary in Atlanta, Georgia
* Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary in Louisville. Kentucky
* McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago, Illinois
* Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
* Princeton Theological Seminary, the first chartered by the General Assembly, in Princeton, New Jersey
* San Francisco Theological Seminary in San Anselmo, California (covenant affiliation treated as institutional affiliation)
* Union Presbyterian Seminary in Richmond, Virginia and Charlotte, North Carolina
* University of Dubuque Theological Seminary in Dubuque, Iowa

Two other seminaries are related to the PC(USA) by covenant agreement: Auburn Theological Seminary in New York, New York, and Evangelical Seminary of Puerto Rico in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

There are numerous colleges and universities throughout the United States affiliated with PC(USA). For a complete list, see the article Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities. For more information, see the article PC(USA) seminaries.

While not affiliated with the PC(USA), Fuller Theological Seminary has educated many candidates for PC(USA) ministry and its former president, Mark Labberton, is an ordained minister of the PC(USA).

===Demographics===
When the United Presbyterian Church in the USA merged with the Presbyterian Church in the United States there were 3,131,228 members. Statistics shows steadily decline since 1983. (The combined membership of the PCUS and United Presbyterian Church peaked in 1965 at 4.25 million communicant members.)

According to the PC(USA) data collection, active membership is defined as a member who has been confirmed, or made similar profession of faith, has been baptized, and attends regularly. The reported data on active members do not include &quot;inactive members.&quot; In addition to active members, the PC(USA) archives data on members who are baptized, but not confirmed, and who are inactive. For example, in 2005, the PC(USA) reported 2.3 million active members, 318,291 baptized, but not confirmed, members, and 466,889 inactive members; the total number of members in 2005 was 3.1 million.
The PC (USA) has had the sharpest decline in their active membership among the Protestant denominations in U.S. The denomination lost more than a million active members between 2005 and 2019. As of 2023, the denomination reports having 1,094,733 active members and about 8,572 local congregations. The proposed 2025 and 2026 budgets are based on a projected 4.5% annual membership decline, which projects membership of 1,089,335 (2023), 1,040,315 (2024) and 993,501 (2025). The proposed 2025 per-capita revenue of $10,133,710 at $10.20 per member is unusual, being based on projected 2025 membership, rather than the traditional 2-year lag which would apply 2023 membership. The per-capita rate is set by the General Assembly based on actual reported membership, so it is also unusual that 2023 membership was not reported in time for the 2024 General Assembly meeting. As of August 2024, temporary staff is working rolls and statistics due to an extended medical leave.

The average local Presbyterian Church has 128 members (the mean in 2023). About 22% of the total congregations report between 1 and 25 members. Another 22% report between 26 and 50 members. Another 24% report between 51 and 100 members. The average worship attendance of a local Presbyterian congregation (2023) is 52 (41% of members). The largest congregation in the PC(USA) is Peachtree Presbyterian Church in Atlanta, Georgia, with a reported membership of 7,535 (2023) and attendance of 1,371. Bel Air Presbyterian Church reports the highest attendance, 5,074, with membership of 1,636. It was reported that about 33.5% of the Presbyterian members nationwide are over 71 years old (2023). Membership, attendance, and demographics may be skewed because about 20% of local churches representing an estimated 10% of members (generally smaller churches) did not report statistics in 2022.

Most PC(USA) members are white (88% in 2023). Other racial and ethnic members include African-Americans (4.6%), Asians (3.7%), Hispanics (1.7%), and others (2%). Despite declines in the total membership of the PC(USA), the percentage of racial-ethnic minority members has stayed about the same since 1995. The ratio of female members (about 60%) to male members (40%) has also remained stable since the mid-1960s.

== Beliefs ==

The Presbyterian Church (USA) adheres to Reformed theology. The Book of Order of the Presbyterian Church teaches:
==Worship==
The session of the local congregation has a great deal of freedom in the style and ordering of worship within the guidelines set forth in the Directory for Worship section of the &quot;Book of Order&quot;. Worship varies from congregation to congregation. The order may be very traditional and highly liturgical, or it may be very simple and informal. This variance is not unlike that seen in the &quot;High Church&quot; and &quot;Low Church&quot; styles of the Anglican Church. The &quot;Book of Order&quot; suggests a worship service ordered around five themes: &quot;gathering around the Word, proclaiming the Word, responding to the Word, the sealing of the Word, and bearing and following the Word into the world.&quot; Prayer is central to the service and may be silent, spoken, sung, or read in unison (including the Lord&#x27;s Prayer). Music plays a large role in most PC(USA) worship services and ranges from chant to traditional Protestant hymns, to classical sacred music, to more modern music, depending on the preference of the individual church and is offered prayerfully and not &quot;for entertainment or artistic display.&quot; Scripture is read and usually preached upon. An offering is usually taken.

The Directory for Worship in the Book of Order provides the directions for what must be, or may be included in worship. During the 20th century, Presbyterians were offered optional use of liturgical books:
* The Book of Common Worship of 1906
* The Book of Common Worship of 1932
* The Book of Common Worship of 1946
* The Worshipbook of 1970
* The Book of Common Worship of 1993
* The Book of Common Worship of 2018

For more information, see Liturgical book of the Presbyterian Church (USA)

In regard to vestments, the Directory for Worship leaves that decision up to the ministers. Thus, on a given Sunday morning service, a congregation may see the minister leading worship in street clothes, Geneva gown, or an alb. Among the Paleo-orthodoxy and emerging church Presbyterians, clergy are moving away from the traditional black Geneva gown and reclaiming not only the more ancient Eucharist vestments of alb and chasuble, but also cassock and surplice (typically a full-length Old English style surplice which resembles the Celtic alb, an ungirdled liturgical tunic of the old Gallican Rite).

===The Service for the Lord&#x27;s Day===
The Service for the Lord&#x27;s Day is the name given to the general format or ordering of worship in the Presbyterian Church as outlined in its Constitution&#x27;s Book of Order. There is a great deal of liberty given toward worship in that denomination, so while the underlying order and components for the Service for the Lord&#x27;s Day is extremely common, it varies from congregation to congregation, region to region.

==Influence==
Presbyterians are among the wealthiest religious groups and are disproportionately represented in American business, law, and politics. Many of the nation&#x27;s oldest educational institutions, such as Princeton University, were founded by Presbyterian clergy or were associated with the Presbyterian Church.

Historically, Presbyterians were overrepresented among American scientific elite and Nobel Prize winners. According to &quot;Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States&quot; by Harriet Zuckerman, between 1901 and 1972, 72% of American Nobel Prize laureates have come from a Protestant background, mostly from Episcopalian, Presbyterian or Lutheran background.

The &quot;Boston Brahmins&quot;, who were regarded as the nation&#x27;s social and cultural elites, were often associated with the American upper class, Harvard University; and the Episcopal and the Presbyterian Church. Old money in the United States was typically associated with White Anglo-Saxon Protestant (&quot;WASP&quot;) status, particularly with the Episcopal and Presbyterian Church.

Many Presbyterians have been Presidents, the latest being Ronald Reagan; and they represent 13% of the U.S. Senate, despite being only 2.2% (under 0.4% as of 2021) of the general population.

Presbyterians are among the wealthiest Christian denominations in the United States, Presbyterians tend also to be better educated and they have a high number of graduate (64%) and post-graduate degrees (26%) per capita. According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, Presbyterians ranked as the fourth most financially successful religious group in the United States, with 32% of Presbyterians living in households with incomes of at least $100,000.

==Missions==
The Presbyterian Church (USA) has, in the past, been a leading United States denomination in mission work, and many hospitals, clinics, colleges and universities worldwide trace their origins to the pioneering work of Presbyterian missionaries who founded them more than a century ago.

In 2008, the church supported about 215 (70 as of 2021) missionaries abroad annually with significant further reductions planned for February 2025, as noted above. Many churches sponsor missionaries abroad at the session level (the local church level), and these are not included in official statistics.

The denomination also builds and maintains relationships with Presbyterian, Reformed and other churches around the world, even if this is not usually considered missions.

The PC(USA) is a leader in disaster assistance relief and also participates in or relates to work in other countries through ecumenical relationships, in what is usually considered not missions, but deaconship.

==Ecumenical relationships and full communion partnerships==
The General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (USA) determines and approves ecumenical statements, agreements, and maintains correspondence with other Presbyterian and Reformed bodies, other Christians churches, alliances, councils, and consortia. Ecumenical statements and agreements are subject to the ratification of the presbyteries. The following are some of the major ecumenical agreements and partnerships.

The church is committed to &quot;engage in bilateral and multilateral dialogues with other churches and traditions in order to remove barriers of misunderstanding and establish common affirmations.&quot; As of 2012 it is in dialogue with the Episcopal Church, the Moravian Church, the Korean Presbyterian Church in America, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America, and the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. It also participates in international dialogues through the World Council of Churches and the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The most recent international dialogues include Pentecostal churches, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Orthodox Church in America, and others.

In 2011 the National Presbyterian Church in Mexico, in 2012 the Mizoram Presbyterian Church and in 2015 the Independent Presbyterian Church of Brazil along with the Evangelical Presbyterian and Reformed Church in Peru severed ties with the PCUSA because of the PCUSA&#x27;s teaching with regard to homosexuality.

===National and international ecumenical memberships===
The Presbyterian Church (USA) is in corresponding partnership with the National Council of Churches, the World Communion of Reformed Churches, and the World Council of Churches. It is a member of Churches for Middle East Peace.

===Formula of agreement===
In 1997 the PCUSA and three other churches of Reformation heritage: the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Reformed Church in America and the United Church of Christ, acted on an ecumenical proposal of historic importance, known as &quot;A Formula of Agreement&quot;. The timing reflected a doctrinal consensus which had been developing over the past thirty-two years coupled with an increasing urgency for the church to proclaim a gospel of unity in contemporary society. In light of identified doctrinal consensus, desiring to bear visible witness to the unity of the Church, and hearing the call to engage together in God&#x27;s mission, it was recommended:

The term &quot;full communion&quot; is understood here to specifically mean that the four churches:
* recognize each other as churches in which the gospel is rightly preached and the sacraments rightly administered according to the Word of God;
* withdraw any historic condemnation by one side or the other as inappropriate for the life and faith of our churches today;
* continue to recognize each other&#x27;s Baptism and authorize and encourage the sharing of the Lord&#x27;s Supper among their members; recognize each other&#x27;s various ministries and make provision for the orderly exchange of ordained ministers of Word and Sacrament;
* establish appropriate channels of consultation and decision-making within the existing structures of the churches;
* commit themselves to an ongoing process of theological dialogue in order to clarify further the common understanding of the faith and foster its common expression in evangelism, witness, and service;
* pledge themselves to living together under the Gospel in such a way that the principle of mutual affirmation and admonition becomes the basis of a trusting relationship in which respect and love for the other will have a chance to grow.

The agreement assumed the doctrinal consensus articulated in A Common Calling:The Witness of Our Reformation Churches in North America Today, and is to be viewed in concert with that document. The purpose of A Formula of Agreement is to elucidate the complementarity of affirmation and admonition as the basic principle of entering into full communion and the implications of that action as described in A Common Calling.

The 209th General Assembly (1997) approved A Formula of Agreement and in 1998 the 210th General Assembly declared full communion among these Protestant bodies.

===World Communion of Reformed Churches===
 the World Alliance of Reformed Churches merged with the Reformed Ecumenical Council to form the World Communion of Reformed Churches. The result was a form of full communion similar to that outline in the Formula of Agreement, including orderly exchange of ministers.

===Churches Uniting in Christ===
The PC(USA) is one of nine denominations that joined to form the Consultation on Church Union, which initially sought a merger of the denominations. In 1998 the Seventh Plenary of the Consultation on Church Union approved a document &quot;Churches in Covenant Communion: The Church of Christ Uniting&quot; as a plan for the formation of a covenant communion of churches. In 2002 the nine denominations inaugurated the new relationship and became known as Churches Uniting in Christ. The partnership is considered incomplete until the partnering communions reconcile their understanding of ordination and devise an orderly exchange of clergy.

==Controversies==

===Homosexuality===


Paragraph G-6.0106b of the Book of Order, which was adopted in 1996, prohibited the ordination of those who were not faithful in heterosexual marriage or chaste in singleness. This paragraph was included in the Book of Order from 1997 to 2011, and was commonly referred to by its pre-ratification designation, &quot;Amendment B&quot;. Several attempts were made to remove this from the Book of Order, ultimately culminating in its removal in 2011. In 2011, the Presbyteries of the PC(USA) passed Amendment 10-A permitting congregations to ordain openly gay and lesbian elders and deacons, and allowing presbyteries to ordain ministers without reference to the fidelity/chastity provision, saying &quot;governing bodies shall be guided by Scripture and the confessions in applying standards to individual candidates&quot;.

Many Presbyterian scholars, pastors, and theologians have been heavily involved in the debate over homosexuality over the years. The Presbyterian Church of India&#x27;s cooperation with the Presbyterian Church (USA) was dissolved in 2012 when the PC(USA) voted to ordain openly gay clergy to the ministry. In 2012, the PC(USA) granted permission, nationally, to begin ordaining openly gay and lesbian clergy.

Since 1980, the More Light Churches Network has served many congregations and individuals within American Presbyterianism who promote the full participation of all people in the PC(USA) regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. The Covenant Network of Presbyterians was formed in 1997 to support repeal of &quot;Amendment B&quot; and to encourage networking among like-minded clergy and congregations. Other organizations of Presbyterians, such as the Confessing Movement and the Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals, have organized on the other side of the issue to support the fidelity/chastity standard for ordination, which was removed in 2011.

The Presbyterian Church (USA) voted to allow same-sex marriages on June 19, 2014, during its 221st General Assembly, making it one of the largest Christian denominations in the world to allow same-sex unions. This vote lifted a previous ban, and allows pastors to perform marriages in jurisdictions where it is legal. Additionally, the Assembly approved amending the Book of Order that would change the definition of marriage from &quot;between a man and a woman&quot; to &quot;between two people, traditionally between a man and a woman&quot;.

===General Assembly 2006===
The 2006 &quot;Report of the Theological Task Force on Peace, Unity, and Purity of the Church&quot;, in theory, attempted to find common ground. Some felt that the adoption of this report provided for a clear local option mentioned, while the Stated Clerk of the General Assembly, Clifton Kirkpatrick went on record as saying, &quot;Our standards have not changed. The rules of the Book of Order stay in force and all ordinations are still subject to review by higher governing bodies.&quot; The authors of the report stated that it is a compromise and return to the original Presbyterian culture of local controls. The recommendation for more control by local presbyteries and sessions is viewed by its opposition as a method for bypassing the constitutional restrictions currently in place concerning ordination and marriage, effectively making the constitutional &quot;standard&quot; entirely subjective.

In the General Assembly gathering of June 2006, Presbyterian voting Commissioners passed an &quot;authoritative interpretation&quot;, recommended by the Theological Task Force, of the &quot;Book of Order&quot; (the church constitution). Some argued that this gave presbyteries the &quot;local option&quot; of ordaining or not ordaining anyone based on a particular presbytery&#x27;s reading of the constitutional statute. Others argued that presbyteries have always had this responsibility and that this new ruling did not change but only clarified that responsibility. On June 20, 2006, the General Assembly voted 298 to 221 (or 57% to 43%) to approve such interpretation. In that same session on June 20, the General Assembly also voted 405 to 92 (with 4 abstentions) to uphold the constitutional standard for ordination requiring fidelity in marriage or chastity in singleness.

===General Assembly 2008===
The General Assembly of 2008 took several actions related to homosexuality. The first action was to adopt a different translation of the Heidelberg Catechism from 1962, removing the words &quot;homosexual perversions&quot; among other changes. This will require the approval of the 2010 and 2012 General Assemblies as well as the votes of the presbyteries after the 2010 Assembly. The second action was to approve a new Authoritative Interpretation of G-6.0108 of the &quot;Book of Order&quot; allowing for the ordaining body to make decisions on whether or not a departure from the standards of belief of practice is sufficient to preclude ordination. Some argue that this creates &quot;local option&quot; on ordaining homosexual persons. The third action was to replace the text of &quot;Amendment B&quot; with new text: &quot;Those who are called to ordained service in the church, by their assent to the constitutional questions for ordination and installation (W-4.4003), pledge themselves to live lives obedient to Jesus Christ the Head of the Church, striving to follow where he leads through the witness of the Scriptures, and to understand the Scriptures through the instruction of the Confessions. In so doing, they declare their fidelity to the standards of the Church. Each governing body charged with examination for ordination or installation (G-14.0240 and G-14.0450) establishes the candidate&#x27;s sincere efforts to adhere to these standards.&quot; This would have removed the &quot;fidelity and chastity&quot; clause. This third action failed to obtain the required approval of a majority of the presbyteries by June 2009. Fourth, a resolution was adopted to affirm the definition of marriage from Scripture and the Confessions as being between a man and a woman.

===General Assembly 2010===
In July 2010, by a vote of 373 to 323, the General Assembly voted to propose to the presbyteries for ratification a constitutional amendment to remove from the Book of Order section G-6.0106.b. which included this explicit requirement for ordination: &quot;Among these standards is the requirement to live either in fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman (W-4.9001), or chastity in singleness.&quot; This proposal required ratification by a majority of the 173 presbyteries within 12 months of the General Assembly&#x27;s adjournment. A majority of presbytery votes was reached in May 2011. The constitutional amendment took effect July 10, 2011. This amendment shifted back to the ordaining body the responsibility for making decisions about whom they shall ordain and what they shall require of their candidates for ordination. It neither prevents nor imposes the use of the so-called &quot;fidelity and chastity&quot; requirement, but it removes that decision from the text of the constitution and places that judgment responsibility back upon the ordaining body where it had traditionally been prior to the insertion of the former G-6.0106.b. in 1997. Each ordaining body, the session for deacon or elder and the presbytery for minister, is now responsible to make its own interpretation of what scripture and the confessions require of ordained officers.

===General Assembly 2014===
In June 2014, the General Assembly approved a change in the wording of its constitution defining marriage as a contract &quot;between a woman and a man&quot; to that of a contract &quot;between two people, traditionally a man and a woman&quot;. It allowed gay and lesbian weddings within the church and further allowed clergy to perform same-sex weddings. That revision gave clergy the choice of whether or not to preside over same-sex marriages; clergy were not compelled to perform same-sex marriages.

===Property ownership===
PC(USA)&#x27;s book of order includes a &quot;trust clause&quot;, under which the presbytery may assert a claim to the property of the congregation in the event of a congregational split, dissolution (closing), or disassociation from the PC(USA). In interpreting this trust clause, PC(USA) does not consider equitable factors such as the congregation&#x27;s relative contribution to the financing of its property, or the relative percentage of members voting to disassociate. Nor does PC(USA) consider legal factors of state trust law such as written consent to the trust in the property&#x27;s title deed or the congregation&#x27;s bylaws. The trust clause does not prevent particular churches from leaving the denomination, but if they do, they may not be permitted to keep their real property unless by agreement with the presbytery. This provision, and a similar provision of the Episcopal Church, has been tested in various courts, with mixed results.

===Israeli–Palestinian conflict===

In June 2004, the General Assembly met in Richmond, Virginia, and adopted by a vote of 431–62 a resolution that called on the church&#x27;s committee on Mission Responsibility through Investment (MRTI) &quot;to initiate a process of phased, selective divestment in multinational corporations operating in Israel&quot;. The resolution also said &quot;the occupation ... has proven to be at the root of evil acts committed against innocent people on both sides of the conflict&quot;. The church statement at the time noted that &quot;divestment is one of the strategies that U.S. churches used in the 1970s and 80s in a successful campaign to end apartheid in South Africa&quot;.

A second resolution, calling for an end to the construction of a wall by the state of Israel, passed. The resolution opposed to the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier, regardless of its location, and opposed the United States government making monetary contribution to the construction. The General Assembly also adopted policies rejecting Christian Zionism and allowing the continued funding of conversionary activities aimed at Jews. Together, the resolutions caused tremendous dissent within the church and a sharp disconnect with the Jewish community. Leaders of several American Jewish groups communicated to the church their concerns about the use of economic leverages that apply specifically to companies operating in Israel. Some critics of the divestment policy accused church leaders of anti-Semitism.

In June 2006, after the General Assembly in Birmingham, Alabama changed policy (details), both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups praised the resolution. Pro-Israel groups, who had written General Assembly commissioners to express their concerns about a corporate engagement/divestment strategy focused on Israel, praised the new resolution, saying that it reflected the church stepping back from a policy that singled out companies working in Israel. Pro-Palestinian groups said that the church maintained the opportunity to engage and potentially divest from companies that support the Israeli occupation, because such support would be considered inappropriate according to the customary MRTI process.

In August 2011, the American National Middle Eastern Presbyterian Caucus (NMEPC) endorsed the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel.

In January 2014, The PC(USA) published &quot;Zionism unsettled&quot;, which was commended as &quot;a valuable opportunity to explore the political ideology of Zionism&quot;. One critic claimed it was anti-Zionist and characterized the Israeli–Palestinian as a conflict fueled by a &quot;pathology inherent in Zionism&quot;. The Simon Wiesenthal Center described the study guide as &quot;a hit-piece outside all norms of interfaith dialogue. It is a compendium of distortions, ignorance and outright lies – that tragically has emanated too often from elites within this church&quot;. The PC(USA) subsequently withdrew the publication from sale on its website.

On June 20, 2014, the General Assembly in Detroit approved a measure (310–303) calling for divestment from stock in Caterpillar, Hewlett-Packard and Motorola Solutions in protest of Israeli policies on the West Bank. The vote was immediately and sharply criticized by the American Jewish Committee which accused the General Assembly of acting out of anti-Semitic motives. Proponents of the measure strongly denied the accusations.

In June 2022, at its 225th General Assembly, the church&#x27;s Committee on International Engagement voted to declare Israel an apartheid state and designate Nakba Day. The committee also called for an end to Israel&#x27;s blockade of the Gaza Strip and affirmed the &quot;right of all people to live and worship peacefully&quot; in Jerusalem.

<text>The Piña Colada (; , &quot;pineapple&quot;, and , &quot;strained&quot;) is a cocktail made with rum, cream of coconut, and pineapple juice, usually served either blended or shaken with ice. It may be garnished with either a pineapple wedge, maraschino cherry, or both. The drink originated in Puerto Rico.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;piña colada&quot; (Spanish) literally means &quot;strained pineapple&quot;, a reference to the freshly pressed and strained pineapple juice used in the drink&#x27;s preparation.

== History ==
===Legendary origins===

The earliest known story states that in the 19th century, Puerto Rican pirate Roberto Cofresí, to boost the morale of his crew, gave them a beverage or cocktail that contained coconut, pineapple, and white rum. This was what would be later known as Piña Colada. With his death in 1825, the recipe for the beverage was lost.

===First mentions===

In 1922, &quot;Travel&quot; magazine described &quot;piña colada&quot; as sugar, lime, and ice mixed in with pineapple juice and Bacardi rum.

In 1924, National Geographic magazine, reporting from Puerto Rico, mentioned a pineapple juice and crushed ice beverage, known locally as &quot;piña fría (cold pineapple).&quot;

In 1950, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Drinks in the West Indies range from Martinique&#x27;s famous rum punch to Cuba&#x27;s pina colada (rum, pineapple and coconut milk).&quot;

===Creation===

In 1954, University of Puerto Rico Professor Ramon López Irizarry invented a new, improved method for the extraction of coconut cream. He patented the process and created Coco López, a sweet, creamy coconut cream, which was used in the invention of the Piña Colada in Puerto Rico. This product, sold today as &quot;Cream of Coconut&quot;, is widely available around the world, and is most commonly used to make the cocktail.

The Caribe Hilton Hotel claims Ramón &quot;Monchito&quot; Marrero created the Piña Colada in 1954 while a bartender at the hotel. According to this account, Marrero finally settled upon the recipe for the Piña Colada, which he felt captured the true nature and essence of Puerto Rico. The hotel was presented with a proclamation in 2004 by Puerto Rico Governor Sila M. Calderón celebrating the drink&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

A Spaniard by the name of Ricardo García also claims to have invented the drink in 1953, while working at the Caribe Hilton Hotel in San Juan. 

Barrachina, a restaurant in Puerto Rico, says that &quot;a traditional Spanish bartender Don Ramón Portas Mingot in 1963 created what became the world&#x27;s famous drink: the Piña Colada.&quot;

In 1978, Puerto Rico proclaimed the cocktail to be its official drink.

== Preparation ==

As recounted by his friends in José L. Díaz de Villegas&#x27;s book, the original Monchito recipe was to pour 85 grams of cream of coconut, 170 grams of pineapple juice and 43 grams of white rum into a blender or shaker with crushed ice, blend or shake very well until smooth, then pour into chilled glass and garnish with pineapple wedge and/or a maraschino cherry.
There are many recipes for piña colada. The International Bartenders Association specifies it as:

Ingredients
* (5 parts) white rum
* (3 parts) coconut cream
* (5 parts) pineapple juice

Method

Mix with crushed ice in blender until smooth, then pour into a chilled glass, garnish and serve. Alternately, the three main components can simply be added to a cocktail glass with ice cubes.

In San Juan, Puerto Rico, a different recipe is used:

&quot;Ingredients&quot;
* heavy cream
* frozen freshly pressed pineapple juice
* cream of coconut
* rum

Method

Freeze pineapple juice before use. In a blender, combine cream of coconut, frozen pineapple juice, heavy cream and rum. Pour in a desired 12-ounce container and use a cherry and fresh pineapple for a garnish.

=== Variations ===
Different proportions of the core ingredients, as well as different types of rum, may all be used in the piña colada. Frozen piña coladas are also served. Other named variations include

* Lava Flow or Miami Vice – strawberry daiquiri and piña colada layered in one glass.
* Scotsman colada – substitute rum for Scotch.
* Tepache colada – a piña colada variation using tepache developed by JungleBird in Santurce, Puerto Rico. Recipe calls for 1.5 oz gold rum, 2 oz tepache and 1.5 oz coconut cream.

== In popular culture ==
In the United States, National Piña Colada Day is celebrated on 10 July.

The cocktail gained worldwide fame after Rupert Holmes&#x27; 1979 song, &quot;Escape (The Piña Colada Song)&quot;, became an international hit.

Piña coladas are referred to in the 2023 Eurovision entry &quot;Cha Cha Cha&quot; by Finnish rapper Käärijä, in which he describes drinking piña coladas after an exhausting week, before letting himself go on the dancefloor. The song led to an increased popularity of the drink in Finland.

<text>PackBits is a fast, simple lossless compression scheme for run-length encoding of data.

Apple introduced the PackBits format with the release of MacPaint on the Macintosh computer. This compression scheme can be used in TIFF files. TGA files also use this RLE compression scheme, but treats data stream as pixels instead of bytes. Packbit compression was also used in ILBM files. 

A PackBits data stream consists of packets with a one-byte header followed by data. The header is a signed byte; the data can be signed, unsigned, or packed (such as MacPaint pixels).

In the following table, &quot;n&quot; is the value of the header byte as a signed integer.

Note that interpreting 0 as positive or negative makes no difference in the output. Runs of two bytes adjacent to non-runs are typically written as literal data. There is no way based on the PackBits data to determine the end of the data stream; that is to say, one must already know the size of the compressed or uncompressed data before reading a PackBits data stream to know where it ends.

Apple Computer (see the external link) provides this short example of packed data:
codice_1

The following code, written in Microsoft VBA, unpacks the data:

Sub UnpackBitsDemo()
 Dim File As Variant
 Dim MyOutput As String
 Dim Count As Long
 Dim i As Long, j As Long
 File = &quot;FE AA 02 80 00 2A FD AA 03 80 00 2A 22 F7 AA&quot;
 File = Split(File, &quot; &quot;)
 For i = LBound(File) To UBound(File)
 Count = Application.WorksheetFunction.Hex2Dec(File(i))
 Select Case Count
 Case Is &gt;= 128
 Count = 256 - Count &#x27;Two&#x27;s Complement
 For j = 0 To Count &#x27;zero-based
 MyOutput = MyOutput &amp; File(i + 1) &amp; &quot; &quot;
 Next j
 i = i + 1 &#x27;Adjust the pointer
 Case Else
 For j = 0 To Count &#x27;zero-based
 MyOutput = MyOutput &amp; File(i + j + 1) &amp; &quot; &quot;
 Next j
 i = i + j &#x27;Adjust the pointer
 End Select
 Next i

 Debug.Print MyOutput

<doc id="25036" wikidata="Q16250593" url="?curid=25036" title="Pub rock (Australia)">
<text>Pub rock is a style of Australian rock and roll that peaked in popularity throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and that continues to influence Australian music into the 21st century. It is named after the live music circuit in which most associated bands developed their sound: inner-city and suburban pubs. These often noisy, hot, small and crowded venues favoured loud, riff-based heavy rock.

Australian pub rock emerged in the early 1970s, with bands such as Billy Thorpe &amp; The Aztecs, Buffalo, Coloured Balls and Blackfeather pioneering the sound by incorporating hard rock and blues rock, and occasionally elements of progressive rock and psychedelic rock. It developed separately from British pub rock, with the Australian sound being heavier, bluesier and more hard-edged. Later acts such as AC/DC, Rose Tattoo and Cold Chisel expanded the sound further and achieved mainstream success.

In a few Australian cities, particularly Melbourne, pub rock was associated with the Sharpies youth subculture.

== History ==

=== Background ===
The emergence of the Australian version of the pub rock genre and the related pub circuit was the result of several interconnected factors. From the 1950s to the 1970s, mainly because of restrictive state liquor licensing laws, only a small proportion of live pop and rock music in Australia was performed on licensed premises (mostly private clubs or discotheques); the majority of concerts were held in non-licensed venues like community, church or municipal halls. These concerts and dances were &#x27;all-ages&#x27; events—often with adult supervision—and alcohol was not served.

During the 1960s, however, Australian states began liberalising their licensing laws. Sunday Observance Acts were repealed, pub opening hours were extended, discriminatory regulations — such as the long-standing ban on women entering or drinking in public bars — were removed, and in the 1970s the age of legal majority was lowered from 21 to 18. Concurrently, the members of the so-called &quot;Baby Boomer&quot; generation — who were the main audience for pop and rock music — were reaching their late teens and early twenties, and were thus able to enter such licensed premises. Pub owners soon realised that providing live music (which was often free) would draw young people to pubs in large numbers, and regular rock performances soon became a fixture at many pubs.

=== First bands emerge ===
In the early 1970s, Sydney-based groups such as Billy Thorpe &amp; The Aztecs, Blackfeather and Buffalo pioneered the Australian pub rock sound. Billy Thorpe &amp; The Aztecs consisted of Thorpe on lead vocals and guitar, Jimmy Thompson on drums, Paul Wheeler on bass guitar and Lobby Loyde (ex-Purple Hearts, Wild Cherries) on lead guitar. They released a cover version of Willie Dixon&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning, School Girl&quot;. They developed a heavy sound and in July 1970, Warren &#x27;Pig&#x27; Morgan (piano, backing vocals) had joined and the band recorded &quot;The Hoax Is Over&quot;, which was released in January 1971. Thorpe described their sound: &quot;[It was] like we were standing on a pair of Boeing 747 engines. It cracked the foundations and broke windows in neighbouring buildings&quot;.

By early 1971, Blackfeather consisted of Neale Johns on lead vocals, John Robinson on lead guitar (ex-Lonely Ones, Monday&#x27;s Children, Dave Miller Set), Robert Fortesque on bass guitar, and Alexander Kash on drums. Their debut album, &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;, appeared in April 1971. In May they had a hit with &quot;Seasons of Change&quot;, which peaked at No. 15 on the &quot;Go-Set&quot; National Top 40 Singles Chart. Buffalo formed in August 1971 by Dave Tice on co-lead vocals (ex-Head) with Paul Balbi on drums, John Baxter on guitar and Peter Wells on bass guitar. Their debut album, &quot;Dead Forever...&quot;, appeared in June the following year. According to Australian rock music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, &quot;The seeds for Australian heavy rock can be traced back to two important sources, Billy Thorpe&#x27;s Seventies Aztecs and Sydney band Buffalo&quot;. In 1972, Aztecs member Lobby Lloyd formed Coloured Balls, which became the favoured band of the sharpies youth subculture.
Notable pub-rock venues include the Largs Pier Hotel and the Governor Hindmarsh Hotel in Adelaide; the Royal Antler Hotel in Narrabeen, Sydney; the Civic Hotel in Sydney&#x27;s city centre; the Star Hotel in Newcastle, New South Wales; and the Station Hotel in Prahran, Melbourne, which was one of the premier pub-rock venues in Australia for more than two decades. Additionally, Poyntons Carlton Club Hotel in Carlton was Melbourne&#x27;s first Sunday night live pub-rock venue; Charles Hotel in Perth is the only remaining pub-rock venue in Perth.

=== Expansion of the sound ===

Many city and suburban pubs gained renown for their support of live music, and many prominent Australian bands — including AC/DC, Cold Chisel, The Angels and The Dingoes — developed their style at these venues in the early days of their careers. Australian musicologist Ian McFarlane described how AC/DC took &quot;the raw energy of Aussie pub rock, extend its basic guidelines, serve it up to a teenybop &quot;Countdown&quot; audience and still reap the benefits of the live circuit by packing out the pubs&quot;. He found that Cold Chisel &quot;fused a combination of rockabilly, hard rock and rough-house soul&#x27;n&#x27;blues that was defiantly Australian in outlook&quot;. He noted The Angels had &quot;a profound effect on the Australian live music scene of the late 1970s/early 1980s. [They] helped redefine the Australian pub rock tradition ... [their] brand of no-frills, hard-driving boogie rock attracted pub goers in unprecedented numbers&quot;. The Dingoes provided a &quot;spirited combination of R&amp;B, country and red-hot rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll was imbued with a delightful sense of time and place&quot; according to McFarlane.

As the pub-rock phenomenon expanded, hundreds of hotels in capital cities and major towns began providing regular live music, and a thriving circuit evolved, enabling bands to tour up and down the eastern and southern coast of Australia from North Queensland to South Australia.

A band like Hunters &amp; Collectors, for example, saw their sound harden from their arty origins (which included a brass section, experimental percussion, and complex arrangements) to a more straightforward rock sound with emphasis on drums, bass, and simple guitar riffs; it was a sound that more suited the beer barns they were to play in over their extensive touring career.

Though Australia has a relatively small population, the proportionally high number of venues that bands could play in, mainly along the Eastern coast, meant that a band could tour extensively, often playing every night for long periods. This would allow bands such as AC/DC, Cold Chisel, INXS, Midnight Oil, Rose Tattoo and others to build their reputation and take their live skills into large venues in the US and Europe with ease.

Several Australian pub rock bands, including Cosmic Psychos and feedtime, directly influenced the emergent grunge scene in the United States in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the 2010s, a new generation of Australian bands revived the Australian pub rock sound, including Bad//Dreems, Amyl and the Sniffers and The Chats.

<text>The term phonation has slightly different meanings depending on the subfield of phonetics. Among some phoneticians, &quot;phonation&quot; is the process by which the vocal folds produce certain sounds through quasi-periodic vibration. This is the definition used among those who study laryngeal anatomy and physiology and speech production in general. Phoneticians in other subfields, such as linguistic phonetics, call this process &quot;voicing&quot;, and use the term &quot;phonation&quot; to refer to any oscillatory state of any part of the larynx that modifies the airstream, of which voicing is just one example. Voiceless and supra-glottal phonations are included under this definition.

==Voicing==
The phonatory process, or voicing, occurs when air is expelled from the lungs through the glottis, creating a pressure drop across the larynx. When this drop becomes sufficiently large, the vocal folds start to oscillate. The minimum pressure drop required to achieve phonation is called the phonation threshold pressure (PTP), and for humans with normal vocal folds, it is approximately 2–3 cm H2O. The motion of the vocal folds during oscillation is mostly lateral, though there is also some superior component as well. However, there is almost no motion along the length of the vocal folds. The oscillation of the vocal folds serves to modulate the pressure and flow of the air through the larynx, and this modulated airflow is the main component of the sound of most voiced phones.

The sound that the larynx produces is a harmonic series. In other words, it consists of a fundamental tone (called the fundamental frequency, the main acoustic cue for the percept pitch) accompanied by harmonic overtones, which are multiples of the fundamental frequency. According to the source–filter theory, the resulting sound excites the resonance chamber that is the vocal tract to produce the individual speech sounds.

The vocal folds will not oscillate if they are not sufficiently close to one another, are not under sufficient tension or under too much tension, or if the pressure drop across the larynx is not sufficiently large. In linguistics, a phone is called voiceless if there is no phonation during its occurrence. In speech, voiceless phones are associated with vocal folds that are elongated, highly tensed, and placed laterally (abducted) when compared to vocal folds during phonation.

Fundamental frequency, the main acoustic cue for the percept &quot;pitch&quot;, can be varied through a variety of means. Large scale changes are accomplished by increasing the tension in the vocal folds through contraction of the cricothyroid muscle. Smaller changes in tension can be effected by contraction of the thyroarytenoid muscle or changes in the relative position of the thyroid and cricoid cartilages, as may occur when the larynx is lowered or raised, either volitionally or through movement of the tongue to which the larynx is attached via the hyoid bone. In addition to tension changes, fundamental frequency is also affected by the pressure drop across the larynx, which is mostly affected by the pressure in the lungs, and will also vary with the distance between the vocal folds. Variation in fundamental frequency is used linguistically to produce intonation and tone.

There are currently two main theories as to how vibration of the vocal folds is initiated: the myoelastic theory and the aerodynamic theory. These two theories are not in contention with one another and it is quite possible that both theories are true and operating simultaneously to initiate and maintain vibration. A third theory, the neurochronaxic theory, was in considerable vogue in the 1950s, but has since been largely discredited.

===Myoelastic and aerodynamic theory===
The myoelastic theory states that when the vocal cords are brought together and breath pressure is applied to them, the cords remain closed until the pressure beneath them, the subglottic pressure, is sufficient to push them apart, allowing air to escape and reducing the pressure enough for the muscle tension recoil to pull the folds back together again. The pressure builds up once again until the cords are pushed apart, and the whole cycle keeps repeating itself. The rate at which the cords open and close, the number of cycles per second, determines the pitch of the phonation.

The aerodynamic theory is based on the Bernoulli energy law in fluids. The theory states that when a stream of breath is flowing through the glottis while the arytenoid cartilages are held together (by the action of the interarytenoid muscles), a push-pull effect is created on the vocal fold tissues that maintains self-sustained oscillation. The push occurs during glottal opening, when the glottis is convergent, and the pull occurs during glottal closing, when the glottis is divergent. Such an effect causes a transfer of energy from the airflow to the vocal fold tissues which overcomes losses by dissipation and sustain the oscillation. The amount of lung pressure needed to begin phonation is defined by Titze as the oscillation threshold pressure. During glottal closure, the air flow is cut off until breath pressure pushes the folds apart and the flow starts up again, causing the cycles to repeat.
The textbook entitled Myoelastic Aerodynamic Theory of Phonation by Ingo Titze credits Janwillem van den Berg as the originator of the theory and provides detailed mathematical development of the theory.

===Neurochronaxic theory===
This theory states that the frequency of the vocal fold vibration is determined by the chronaxie of the recurrent nerve, and not by breath pressure or muscular tension. Advocates of this theory thought that every single vibration of the vocal folds was due to an impulse from the recurrent laryngeal nerves and that the acoustic center in the brain regulated the speed of vocal fold vibration. Speech and voice scientists have long since abandoned this theory as the muscles have been shown to not be able to contract fast enough to accomplish the vibration. In addition, persons with paralyzed vocal folds can produce phonation, which would not be possible according to this theory. Phonation occurring in excised larynges would also not be possible according to this theory.

==State of the glottis==

In linguistic phonetic treatments of phonation, such as those of Peter Ladefoged, phonation was considered to be a matter of points on a continuum of tension and closure of the vocal cords. More intricate mechanisms were occasionally described, but they were difficult to investigate, and until recently the state of the glottis and phonation were considered to be nearly synonymous.

If the vocal cords are completely relaxed, with the arytenoid cartilages apart for maximum airflow, the cords do not vibrate. This is voiceless phonation, and is extremely common with obstruents. If the arytenoids are pressed together for glottal closure, the vocal cords block the airstream, producing stop sounds such as the glottal stop. In between there is a sweet spot of maximum vibration. Also, the existence of an optimal glottal shape for ease of phonation has been shown, at which the lung pressure required to initiate the vocal cord vibration is minimum. This is modal voice, and is the normal state for vowels and sonorants in all the world&#x27;s languages. However, the aperture of the arytenoid cartilages, and therefore the tension in the vocal cords, is one of degree between the end points of open and closed, and there are several intermediate situations utilized by various languages to make contrasting sounds.

For example, Gujarati has vowels with a partially lax phonation called breathy voice or murmured voice (transcribed in IPA with a subscript umlaut ), while Burmese has vowels with a partially tense phonation called creaky voice or laryngealized voice (transcribed in IPA with a subscript tilde ). The Jalapa dialect of Mazatec is unusual in contrasting both with modal voice in a three-way distinction. (Mazatec is a tonal language, so the glottis is making several tonal distinctions simultaneously with the phonation distinctions.)
:&quot;Note: There was an editing error in the source of this information. The latter two translations may have been mixed up.&quot;

Javanese does not have modal voice in its stops, but contrasts two other points along the phonation scale, with more moderate departures from modal voice, called slack voice and stiff voice. The &quot;muddy&quot; consonants in Shanghainese are slack voice; they contrast with tenuis and aspirated consonants.

Although each language may be somewhat different, it is convenient to classify these degrees of phonation into discrete categories. A series of seven alveolar stops, with phonations ranging from an open/lax to a closed/tense glottis, are:

The IPA diacritics &quot;under-ring&quot; and &quot;subscript wedge&quot;, commonly called &quot;voiceless&quot; and &quot;voiced&quot;, are sometimes added to the symbol for a voiced sound to indicate more lax/open (slack) and tense/closed (stiff) states of the glottis, respectively. (Ironically, adding the &#x27;voicing&#x27; diacritic to the symbol for a voiced consonant indicates &quot;less&quot; modal voicing, not more, because a modally voiced sound is already fully voiced, at its sweet spot, and any further tension in the vocal cords dampens their vibration.)

Alsatian, like several Germanic languages, has a typologically unusual phonation in its stops. The consonants transcribed (ambiguously called &quot;lenis&quot;) are partially voiced: The vocal cords are positioned as for voicing, but do not actually vibrate. That is, they are technically voiceless, but without the open glottis usually associated with voiceless stops. They contrast with both modally voiced and modally voiceless in French borrowings, as well as aspirated word initially.

If the arytenoid cartiledges are parted to admit turbulent airflow, the result is whisper phonation if the vocal folds are adducted, and whispery voice phonation (murmur) if the vocal folds vibrate modally. Whisper phonation is heard in many productions of French , and the &quot;voiceless&quot; vowels of many North American languages are actually whispered.

===Glottal consonants===
It has long been noted that in many languages, both phonologically and historically, the glottal consonants do not behave like other consonants. Phonetically, they have no manner or place of articulation other than the state of the glottis: &quot;glottal closure&quot; for , &quot;breathy voice&quot; for , and &quot;open airstream&quot; for . Some phoneticians have described these sounds as neither glottal nor consonantal, but instead as instances of pure phonation, at least in many European languages. However, in Semitic languages they do appear to be true glottal consonants.

==Supra-glottal phonation==
In the last few decades it has become apparent that phonation may involve the entire larynx, with as many as six valves and muscles working either independently or together. From the glottis upward, these articulations are:
#glottal (the vocal cords), producing the distinctions described above
#ventricular (the &#x27;false vocal cords&#x27;, partially covering and damping the glottis)
#arytenoid (sphincteric compression forwards and upwards)
#epiglotto-pharyngeal (retraction of the tongue and epiglottis, potentially closing onto the pharyngeal wall)
#raising or lowering of the entire larynx
#narrowing of the pharynx

Until the development of fiber-optic laryngoscopy, the full involvement of the larynx during speech production was not observable, and the interactions among the six laryngeal articulators is still poorly understood. However, at least two supra-glottal phonations appear to be widespread in the world&#x27;s languages. These are harsh voice (&#x27;ventricular&#x27; or &#x27;pressed&#x27; voice), which involves overall constriction of the larynx, and faucalized voice (&#x27;hollow&#x27; or &#x27;yawny&#x27; voice), which involves overall expansion of the larynx.

The Bor dialect of Dinka has contrastive modal, breathy, faucalized, and harsh voice in its vowels, as well as three tones. The &quot;ad hoc&quot; diacritics employed in the literature are a subscript double quotation mark for faucalized voice, , and underlining for harsh voice, . Examples are,

Other languages with these contrasts are Bai (modal, breathy, and harsh voice), Kabiye (faucalized and harsh voice, previously seen as ±ATR), Somali (breathy and harsh voice).

Elements of laryngeal articulation or phonation may occur widely in the world&#x27;s languages as phonetic detail even when not phonemically contrastive. For example, simultaneous glottal, ventricular, and arytenoid activity (for something other than epiglottal consonants) has been observed in Tibetan, Korean, Nuuchahnulth, Nlaka&#x27;pamux, Thai, Sui, Amis, Pame, Arabic, Tigrinya, Cantonese, and Yi.

==European language examples==
In languages such as French and Portuguese, all obstruents occur in pairs, one modally voiced and one voiceless: [b] [d] [g] [v] [z] [ʒ] → [p] [t] [k] [f] [s] [ʃ].

In English, every voiced fricative corresponds to a voiceless one. For the pairs of English stops, however, the distinction is better specified as voice onset time rather than simply voice: In initial position, /b d g/ are only partially voiced (voicing begins during the hold of the consonant), and /p t k/ are aspirated (voicing begins only well after its release). Certain English morphemes have voiced and voiceless allomorphs, such as: the plural, verbal, and possessive endings spelled &quot;-s&quot; (voiced in &quot;kids&quot; but voiceless in &quot;kits&quot; ), and the past-tense ending spelled &quot;-ed&quot; (voiced in &quot;buzzed&quot; but voiceless in &quot;fished&quot; ).

A few European languages, such as Finnish, have no phonemically voiced obstruents but pairs of long and short consonants instead. Outside Europe, the lack of voicing distinctions is common; indeed, in Australian languages it is nearly universal.

==Vocal registers==
===Phonology===

In phonology, a register is a combination of tone and vowel phonation into a single phonological parameter. For example, among its vowels, Burmese combines modal voice with low tone, breathy voice with falling tone, creaky voice with high tone, and glottal closure with high tone. These four registers contrast with each other, but no other combination of phonation (modal, breath, creak, closed) and tone (high, low, falling) is found.

===Pedagogy and speech pathology===

Among vocal pedagogues and speech pathologists, a vocal register also refers to a particular phonation limited to a particular range of pitch, which possesses a characteristic sound quality. The term &quot;register&quot; may be used for several distinct aspects of the human voice:

*A particular part of the vocal range, such as the upper, middle, or lower registers, which may be bounded by vocal breaks
*A particular phonation
*A resonance area such as chest voice or head voice
*A certain vocal timbre

Four combinations of these elements are identified in speech pathology: the vocal fry register, the modal register, the falsetto register, and the whistle register.

<doc id="25039" wikidata="Q1143969" url="?curid=25039" title="Principal ideal domain">
<text>In mathematics, a principal ideal domain, or PID, is an integral domain (that is, a commutative ring without nonzero zero divisors) in which every ideal is principal (that is, is formed by the multiples of a single element). Some authors such as Bourbaki refer to PIDs as principal rings.

Principal ideal domains are mathematical objects that behave like the integers, with respect to divisibility: any element of a PID has a unique factorization into prime elements (so an analogue of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic holds); any two elements of a PID have a greatest common divisor (although it may not be possible to find it using the Euclidean algorithm). If and are elements of a PID without common divisors, then every element of the PID can be written in the form , etc.

Principal ideal domains are Noetherian, they are integrally closed, they are unique factorization domains and Dedekind domains. All Euclidean domains and all fields are principal ideal domains.

Principal ideal domains appear in the following chain of class inclusions:

==Examples==
Examples include:
* formula_1: any field,
* formula_2: the ring of integers,
* formula_3: rings of polynomials in one variable with coefficients in a field. (The converse is also true, i.e. if formula_4 is a PID then formula_5 is a field.) Furthermore, a ring of formal power series in one variable over a field is a PID since every ideal is of the form formula_6,
* formula_7: the ring of Gaussian integers,
* formula_8 (where formula_9 is a primitive cube root of 1): the Eisenstein integers,
* Any discrete valuation ring, for instance the ring of -adic integers formula_10.

=== Non-examples ===
Examples of integral domains that are not PIDs:

* formula_11 is an example of a ring that is not a unique factorization domain, since formula_12 Hence it is not a principal ideal domain because principal ideal domains are unique factorization domains. Also, formula_13 is an ideal that cannot be generated by a single element.
* formula_14: the ring of all polynomials with integer coefficients. It is not principal because formula_15 is an ideal that cannot be generated by a single polynomial.
* formula_16 the ring of polynomials in at least two variables over a ring is not principal, since the ideal formula_17 is not principal.
* Most rings of algebraic integers are not principal ideal domains. This is one of the main motivations behind Dedekind&#x27;s definition of Dedekind domains, which allows replacing unique factorization of elements with unique factorization of ideals. In particular, many formula_18 for the primitive p-th root of unity formula_19 are not principal ideal domains. The class number of a ring of algebraic integers gives a measure of &quot;how far away&quot; the ring is from being a principal ideal domain.

==Modules==

The key result is the structure theorem: If &quot;R&quot; is a principal ideal domain, and &quot;M&quot; is a finitely
generated &quot;R&quot;-module, then formula_20 is a direct sum of cyclic modules, i.e., modules with one generator. The cyclic modules are isomorphic to formula_21 for some formula_22 (notice that formula_23 may be equal to formula_24, in which case formula_21 is formula_26).

If &quot;M&quot; is a free module over a principal ideal domain &quot;R&quot;, then every submodule of &quot;M&quot; is again free. This does not hold for modules over arbitrary rings, as the example formula_27 of modules over formula_28 shows.

==Properties==
In a principal ideal domain, any two elements have a greatest common divisor, which may be obtained as a generator of the ideal .

All Euclidean domains are principal ideal domains, but the converse is not true.
An example of a principal ideal domain that is not a Euclidean domain is the ring formula_29, this was proved by Theodore Motzkin and was the first case known. In this domain no and exist, with , so that formula_30, despite formula_31 and formula_32 having a greatest common divisor of .

Every principal ideal domain is a unique factorization domain (UFD). The converse does not hold since for any UFD , the ring of polynomials in 2 variables is a UFD but is not a PID. (To prove this look at the ideal generated by formula_33 It is not the whole ring since it contains no polynomials of degree 0, but it cannot be generated by any one single element.)

#Every principal ideal domain is Noetherian.
#In all unital rings, maximal ideals are prime. In principal ideal domains a near converse holds: every nonzero prime ideal is maximal.
#All principal ideal domains are integrally closed.

The previous three statements give the definition of a Dedekind domain, and hence every principal ideal domain is a Dedekind domain.

Let &quot;A&quot; be an integral domain, the following are equivalent.

# &quot;A&quot; is a PID.
# Every prime ideal of &quot;A&quot; is principal.
# &quot;A&quot; is a Dedekind domain that is a UFD.
# Every finitely generated ideal of &quot;A&quot; is principal (i.e., &quot;A&quot; is a Bézout domain) and &quot;A&quot; satisfies the ascending chain condition on principal ideals.
# &quot;A&quot; admits a Dedekind–Hasse norm.

Any Euclidean norm is a Dedekind-Hasse norm; thus, (5) shows that a Euclidean domain is a PID. (4) compares to:
* An integral domain is a UFD if and only if it is a GCD domain (i.e., a domain where every two elements have a greatest common divisor) satisfying the ascending chain condition on principal ideals.
An integral domain is a Bézout domain if and only if any two elements in it have a gcd &quot;that is a linear combination of the two.&quot; A Bézout domain is thus a GCD domain, and (4) gives yet another proof that a PID is a UFD.

<doc id="25040" wikidata="Q190108" url="?curid=25040" title="Pioneer program">
<text>The Pioneer programs were two series of United States lunar and planetary space probes. The first program, which ran from 1958 to 1960, unsuccessfully attempted to send spacecraft to orbit the Moon, successfully sent one spacecraft to fly by the Moon, and successfully sent one spacecraft to investigate interplanetary space between the orbits of Earth and Venus. The second program, which ran from 1965 to 1992, sent four spacecraft to measure interplanetary space weather, two to explore Jupiter and Saturn, and two to explore Venus. The two outer planet probes, &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; and &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;, became the first two of five artificial objects to achieve the escape velocity that will allow them to leave the Solar System, and carried a golden plaque each depicting a man and a woman and information about the origin and the creators of the probes, in case any extraterrestrials find them someday.

==Naming==
Credit for naming the first probe has been attributed to Stephen A. Saliga, who had been assigned to the Air Force Orientation Group, Wright-Patterson AFB, as chief designer of Air Force exhibits. While he was at a briefing, the spacecraft was described to him, as, a &quot;lunar-orbiting vehicle, with an infrared scanning device.&quot; Saliga thought the title too long, and lacked theme for an exhibit design. He suggested, &quot;Pioneer&quot;, as the name of the probe, since &quot;the Army had already launched and orbited the Explorer satellite, and their Public Information Office was identifying the Army, as, &#x27;Pioneers in Space,&#x27;&quot; and, by adopting the name, the Air Force would &quot;make a &#x27;quantum jump&#x27; as to who, really, [were] the &#x27;Pioneers&#x27; in space.&#x27;&quot;

== Early missions ==
The earliest missions were attempts to achieve Earth&#x27;s escape velocity, simply to show it was feasible and to study the Moon. This included the first launch by NASA which was formed from the old NACA. These missions were carried out by the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division, Army, and NASA.

=== Able space probes (1958–1960) ===

=== Juno II lunar probes (1958–1959) ===
* Pioneer 3 – Lunar flyby, missed Moon due to launcher failure December 6, 1958
* Pioneer 4 – Lunar flyby, achieved Earth escape velocity, launched March 3, 1959

== Later missions (1965–1978) ==

Five years after the early Able space probe missions ended, NASA Ames Research Center used the Pioneer name for a new series of missions, initially aimed at the inner Solar System, before the flyby missions to Jupiter and Saturn. While successful, the missions returned much poorer images than the Voyager program probes would five years later. In 1978, the end of the program saw a return to the inner Solar System, with the Pioneer Venus Orbiter and Multiprobe, this time using orbital insertion rather than flyby missions.

The new missions were numbered beginning with Pioneer 6 (alternate names in parentheses).

=== Interplanetary weather ===
The spacecraft in Pioneer missions 6, 7, 8, and 9 comprised a new interplanetary space weather network:
* Pioneer 6 (Pioneer A) – launched December 1965
* Pioneer 7 (Pioneer B) – launched August 1966
* Pioneer 8 (Pioneer C) – launched December 1967
* Pioneer 9 (Pioneer D) – launched November 1968 (&quot;inactive since 1983&quot;)
* Pioneer E – lost in launcher failure August 1969
Pioneer 6 and Pioneer 9 are in solar orbits with 0.8 AU distance to the Sun. Their orbital periods are therefore slightly shorter than Earth&#x27;s. Pioneer 7 and Pioneer 8 are in solar orbits with 1.1 AU distance to the Sun. Their orbital periods are therefore slightly longer than Earth&#x27;s. Since the probes&#x27; orbital periods differ from that of the Earth, from time to time, they face a side of the Sun that cannot be seen from Earth. The probes can sense parts of the Sun several days before the Sun&#x27;s rotation reveals it to ground-based Earth orbiting observatories.

=== Outer Solar System missions ===
* &quot;Pioneer 10&quot; (Pioneer F) – Jupiter, interstellar medium, launched March 1972
* &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; (Pioneer G) – Jupiter, Saturn, interstellar medium, launched April 1973
* Pioneer H – proposed out-of-ecliptic mission for 1974, never launched. Would have used flight spare for Pioneers 10 and 11.

=== Venus project ===

* Pioneer Venus Orbiter (Pioneer Venus 1, Pioneer 12) – launched May 1978
* Pioneer Venus Multiprobe (Pioneer Venus 2, Pioneer 13) – launched August 1978
** Pioneer Venus Probe Bus – transport vehicle and upper atmosphere probe
** Pioneer Venus Large Probe – 300 kg parachuted probe
** Pioneer Venus North Probe – 75 kg impactor probe
** Pioneer Venus Night Probe – 75 kg impactor probe
** Pioneer Venus Day Probe – 75 kg impactor probe

<doc id="25041" wikidata="Q172913" url="?curid=25041" title="Lockheed P-38 Lightning">
<text>The Lockheed P-38 Lightning is an American single-seat, twin piston-engined fighter aircraft that was used during World War II. Developed for the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) by the Lockheed Corporation, the P-38 incorporated a distinctive twin-boom design with a central nacelle containing the cockpit and armament. Along with its use as a general fighter, the P-38 was used in various aerial combat roles, including as a highly effective fighter-bomber, a night fighter, and a long-range escort fighter when equipped with drop tanks. The P-38 was also used as a bomber-pathfinder, guiding streams of medium and heavy bombers, or even other P-38s equipped with bombs, to their targets. Used in the aerial reconnaissance role, the P-38 accounted for 90% of American aerial film captured over Europe. Although it was not designated a heavy fighter or a bomber destroyer by the USAAC, the P-38 filled those roles and more; unlike German heavy fighters crewed by two or three airmen, the P-38, with its lone pilot, was nimble enough to compete with single-engined fighters.

The P-38 was used most successfully in the Pacific and the China-Burma-India theaters of operations as the aircraft of America&#x27;s top aces, Richard Bong (40 victories), Thomas McGuire (38 victories), and Charles H. MacDonald (27 victories). In the South West Pacific theater, the P-38 was the primary long-range fighter of United States Army Air Forces until the introduction of large numbers of P-51D Mustangs toward the end of the war. Unusually for an early-war fighter design, both engines were supplemented by turbosuperchargers, making it one of the earliest Allied fighters capable of performing well at high altitudes. The turbosuperchargers also muffled the exhaust, making the P-38&#x27;s operation relatively quiet. The Lightning was extremely forgiving in flight and could be mishandled in many ways, but the initial rate of roll in early versions was low relative to other contemporary fighters; this was addressed in later variants with the introduction of hydraulically boosted ailerons. The P-38 was the only American fighter aircraft in large-scale production throughout American involvement in the war, from the Attack on Pearl Harbor to Victory over Japan Day.

==Design and development==
The Lockheed Corporation designed the P-38 in response to a February 1937 specification from the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC). Circular Proposal X-608 was a set of aircraft performance goals authored by First Lieutenants Benjamin S. Kelsey and Gordon P. Saville for a twin-engined, high-altitude &quot;interceptor&quot; having &quot;the tactical mission of interception and attack of hostile aircraft at high altitude.&quot; Forty years later, Kelsey explained that Saville and he drew up the specification using the word &quot;interceptor&quot; as a way to bypass the inflexible Army Air Corps requirement for pursuit aircraft to carry no more than of armament including ammunition, and to bypass the USAAC restriction of single-seat aircraft to one engine. Kelsey was looking for a minimum of of armament. Kelsey and Saville aimed to get a more capable fighter, better at dog fighting and at high-altitude combat. Specifications called for a maximum airspeed of at least at altitude, and a climb to within six minutes, the toughest set of specifications USAAC had ever presented. The unbuilt Vultee XP1015 design was offered to fill this requirement, but was not advanced enough to merit further investigation. A similar proposal for a single-engined fighter was issued at the same time, Circular Proposal X-609, in response to which the Bell P-39 Airacobra was designed. Both proposals required liquid-cooled Allison V-1710 engines with turbosuperchargers and gave extra points for tricycle landing gear.


Lockheed formed a secretive engineering team to implement the project apart from the main factory; this approach later became known as Skunk Works. The Lockheed design team, under the direction of Hall Hibbard and Clarence &quot;Kelly&quot; Johnson, considered a range of twin-engined configurations, including both engines in a central fuselage with push–pull propellers.

The eventual configuration was rare in contemporary production fighter aircraft design, with the Dutch Fokker G.I heavy fighter, and the later Northrop P-61 Black Widow night fighter and Swedish SAAB 21 having a similar planform. The Lockheed team chose twin booms to accommodate the tail assembly, engines, and turbosuperchargers, with a central nacelle for the pilot and armament. The XP-38 gondola mockup was designed to mount two .50-caliber (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns with 200 rounds per gun (rpg), two .30-caliber (7.62 mm) Brownings with 500 rpg, and a United States Army Ordnance Department prototype T1 23 mm (.90 in) autocannon with a rotary magazine as a substitute for the nonexistent 25 mm Hotchkiss aircraft autocannon specified by Kelsey and Saville. In the prototype YP-38s, an Army Ordnance Department T9 37 mm (1.46 in) autocannon (later designated as the M4 in production) with 15 rounds replaced the 23 mm T1. The 15 rounds were in three, five-round clips, an unsatisfactory arrangement according to Kelsey, and the T9/M4 did not perform reliably in flight. Further armament experiments from March to June 1941 resulted in the P-38E combat configuration of four M2 Browning machine guns, and one Hispano 20 mm (.79 in) autocannon with 150 rounds.

Clustering all the armament in the nose was unusual in U.S. aircraft, which typically used wing-mounted guns with trajectories set up to crisscross at one or more points in a convergence zone. The P-38 cannon used heavier 20 mm rounds, creating a different trajectory, so it was inclined upward slightly more than the four machine guns such that the trajectories of the cannon rounds and .50-caliber bullets came together between 350 and 400 yards. Nose-mounted guns did not suffer as much from having their useful ranges limited by pattern convergence, meaning that good pilots could shoot much farther. A Lightning could reliably hit targets at any range up to , whereas the wing guns of other fighters were optimized for a specific range. The rate of fire was about 650 rounds per minute for the 20×110 mm cannon round (130-gram shell) at a muzzle velocity of about , and for the .50-caliber machine guns (43-gram rounds), about 850 rpm at velocity. Combined rate of fire was over 4,000 rpm with roughly every sixth projectile a 20 mm shell. The duration of sustained firing for the 20 mm cannon was about 14 seconds, while the .50-caliber machine guns worked for 35 seconds if each magazine were fully loaded with 500 rounds, or for 21 seconds if 300 rounds were loaded to save weight for long-distance flying.

The Lockheed design incorporated tricycle undercarriage and a bubble canopy, and featured two turbosupercharged 12-cylinder Allison V-1710 engines fitted with counter-rotating propellers to eliminate the effect of engine torque, with the turbochargers positioned behind the engines, the exhaust side of the units exposed along the dorsal surfaces of the booms. Counter-rotation was achieved by the use of &quot;handed&quot; engines; the crankshafts of the engines turned in opposite directions, a relatively easy task for the V-1710 modular-design aircraft powerplant.

The P-38 was the first American fighter to make extensive use of stainless steel and smooth, flush-riveted, butt-jointed aluminum skin panels. It was also the first military airplane to fly faster than in level flight.

===XP-38 and YP-38 prototypes===
Lockheed won the competition on 23 June 1937 with its Model 22, and was contracted to build a prototype XP-38 for US$163,000, though Lockheed&#x27;s own costs on the prototype would add up to $761,000. Construction began in July 1938 in an old bourbon distillery purchased by Lockheed to house expanding operations. This secure and remote site was later identified by Johnson as the first of five Lockheed Skunk Works locations. The XP-38 first flew on 27 January 1939 at the hands of Ben Kelsey.

Kelsey then proposed a speed dash to Wright Field on 11 February 1939 to relocate the aircraft for further testing. General Henry &quot;Hap&quot; Arnold, commander of the USAAC, approved of the record attempt and recommended a cross-country flight to New York. The flight set a speed record by flying from California to New York in seven hours and two minutes, not counting two refueling stops. Kelsey flew conservatively for most of the way, working the engines gently, even throttling back during descent to remove the associated speed advantage. Bundled up against the cold, Arnold congratulated Kelsey at Wright Field during his final refueling stop, and said, &quot;don&#x27;t spare the horses&quot; on the next leg. After climbing out of Wright Field and reaching altitude, Kelsey pushed the XP-38 to . Nearing his destination, Kelsey was ordered by Mitchel Field tower (Hempstead, New York) into a slow landing pattern behind other aircraft. Carburetor icing caused it to be brought down short of the Mitchel runway, and it was wrecked. On the basis of the record flight, though, the USAAC ordered 13 YP-38s on 27 April 1939 for US$134,284 (~$ in ) each. (The &quot;Y&quot; in &quot;YP&quot; was the USAAC&#x27;s designation for service test, i.e. small numbers of early production aircraft, while the &quot;X&quot; in &quot;XP&quot; was for experimental.) Lockheed&#x27;s chief test pilot, Tony LeVier, angrily characterized the accident as an unnecessary publicity stunt, but according to Kelsey, the loss of the prototype, rather than hampering the program, sped the process by cutting short the initial test series. The success of the aircraft design contributed to Kelsey&#x27;s promotion to captain in May 1939.
Manufacture of YP-38s fell behind schedule, at least partly because of changes to meet the need for mass production, making them substantially different in construction from the prototype. Another factor was the sudden required expansion of Lockheed&#x27;s facility in Burbank, taking it from a specialized civilian firm dealing with small orders to a large government defense contractor making Venturas, Harpoons, Lodestars, and Hudsons, and designing the Constellation for TWA. The first YP-38 was not completed until September 1940, with its maiden flight on 17 September. The 13th and final YP-38 was delivered to the USAAC in June 1941; 12 aircraft were retained for flight testing and one for destructive stress testing. The YPs were substantially redesigned and differed greatly in detail from the hand-built XP-38. They were lighter and included changes in engine fit. The propeller rotation was reversed, with the blades spinning outward (away from the cockpit) at the top of their arc, rather than inward as before. This improved the aircraft&#x27;s stability as a gunnery platform.

===High-speed compressibility problems===
Test flights revealed problems initially believed to be tail flutter. During high-speed flight approaching Mach 0.68, especially during dives, the aircraft&#x27;s tail would begin to shake violently, and the nose would tuck under (see Mach tuck), steepening the dive. Once caught in this dive, the fighter would enter a high-speed compressibility stall and the controls would lock up, leaving the pilot no option but to bail out (if possible) or remain with the aircraft until it got down to denser air, where he might have a chance to pull out. During a test flight in May 1941, USAAC Major Signa Gilkey managed to stay with a YP-38 in a compressibility lockup, riding it out until he recovered gradually using elevator trim. Lockheed engineers were very concerned by this limitation, but first had to concentrate on filling the current order of aircraft. In late June 1941, the Army Air Corps was renamed the U.S. Army Air Forces (USAAF), and 65 Lightnings were finished for the service by September 1941, with more on the way for the USAAF, the Royal Air Force (RAF), and the Free French Air Force operating from England.

By November 1941, many of the initial assembly-line challenges had been met, which freed up time for the engineering team to tackle the problem of frozen controls in a dive. Lockheed had a few ideas for tests that would help them find an answer. The first solution tried was the fitting of spring-loaded servo tabs on the elevator trailing edge designed to aid the pilot when control yoke forces rose over , as would be expected in a high-speed dive. At that point, the tabs would begin to multiply the effort of the pilot&#x27;s actions. Expert test pilot Ralph Virden was given a specific high-altitude test sequence to follow and was told to restrict his speed and fast maneuvering in denser air at low altitudes, since the new mechanism could exert tremendous leverage under those conditions. A note was taped to the instrument panel of the test craft underscoring this instruction. On 4 November 1941, Virden climbed into YP-38 #1 and completed the test sequence successfully, but 15 minutes later, was seen in a steep dive followed by a high-G pullout. The tail unit of the aircraft failed at about during the high-speed dive recovery; Virden was killed in the subsequent crash. The Lockheed design office was justifiably upset, but their design engineers could only conclude that servo tabs were &quot;not&quot; the solution for loss of control in a dive. Lockheed still had to find the problem; the USAAF personnel were sure it was flutter, and ordered Lockheed to look more closely at the tail.

In 1941, flutter was a familiar engineering problem related to a too-flexible tail, but the P-38&#x27;s empennage was completely skinned in aluminum rather than fabric and was quite rigid. At no time did the P-38 suffer from true flutter. To prove a point, one elevator and its vertical stabilizers were skinned with metal 63% thicker than standard, but the increase in rigidity made no difference in vibration. Army Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth B. Wolfe (head of Army Production Engineering) asked Lockheed to try external mass balances above and below the elevator, although the P-38 already had large mass balances elegantly placed within each vertical stabilizer. Various configurations of external mass balances were equipped, and dangerously steep test flights were flown to document their performance. Explaining to Wolfe in Report No. 2414, Kelly Johnson wrote, &quot;the violence of the vibration was unchanged and the diving tendency was naturally the same for all conditions.&quot; The external mass balances did not help at all. Nonetheless, at Wolfe&#x27;s insistence, the additional external balances were a feature of every P-38 built from then on.
Johnson said in his autobiography that he pleaded with National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics to do model tests in its wind tunnel. They already had experience of models thrashing around violently at speeds approaching those requested and did not want to risk damaging their tunnel. Gen. Arnold, head of USAAF, ordered them to run the tests, which were done up to Mach 0.74. The P-38&#x27;s dive problem was revealed to be the center of pressure moving back toward the tail when in high-speed airflow. The solution was to change the geometry of the wing&#x27;s lower surface when diving to keep lift within bounds of the top of the wing. In February 1943, quick-acting dive flaps were tried and proven by Lockheed test pilots. The dive flaps were installed outboard of the engine nacelles, and in action, they extended downward 35° in 1.5 seconds. The flaps did not act as a speed brake; they affected the pressure distribution in a way that retained the wing&#x27;s lift.

Late in 1943, a few hundred dive flap field-modification kits were assembled to give North African, European, and Pacific P-38s a chance to withstand compressibility and expand their combat tactics. The kits did not always reach their destination. In March 1944, 200 dive flap kits intended for the European Theater of Operations (ETO) P-38Js were destroyed in a mistaken identification incident in which an RAF fighter shot down the Douglas C-54 Skymaster (mistaken for a German Focke-Wulf Fw 200) taking the shipment to England. Back in Burbank, P-38Js coming off the assembly line in spring 1944 were towed out to the ramp and modified in the open air. The flaps were finally incorporated into the production line in June 1944 on the last 210 P-38Js. Despite testing having proved the dive flaps effective in improving tactical maneuvers, a 14-month delay in production limited their implementation, with only the final half of all Lightnings built having the dive flaps installed as an assembly-line sequence.

Johnson later recalled:
Buffeting was another early aerodynamic problem. Distinguishing it from compressibility was difficult, as both were reported by test pilots as &quot;tail shake&quot;. Buffeting came about from airflow disturbances ahead of the tail; the airplane would shake at high speed. Leading-edge wing slots were tried, as were combinations of filleting between the wing, cockpit, and engine nacelles. Air-tunnel test number 15 solved the buffeting completely and its fillet solution was fitted to every subsequent P-38 airframe. Fillet kits were sent out to every squadron flying Lightnings. The problem was traced to a 40% increase in air speed at the wing-fuselage junction where the thickness/chord ratio was highest. An airspeed of at could push airflow at the wing-fuselage junction close to the speed of sound. Filleting solved the buffeting problem for the P-38E and later models.
Another issue with the P-38 arose from its unique design feature of outwardly rotating (at the &quot;tops&quot; of the propeller arcs) counter-rotating propellers. Losing one of two engines in any twin-engined, non-centerline thrust aircraft on takeoff creates sudden drag, yawing the nose toward the dead engine and rolling the wingtip down on the side of the dead engine. Normal training in flying twin-engined aircraft when losing an engine on takeoff is to push the remaining engine to full throttle to maintain airspeed; if a pilot did that in the P-38, regardless of which engine had failed, the resulting engine torque and p-factor force produced a sudden, uncontrollable yawing roll, and the aircraft would flip over and crash. Eventually, procedures were taught to allow a pilot to deal with the situation by reducing power on the running engine, feathering the prop on the failed engine, and then increasing power gradually until the aircraft was in stable flight. Single-engined takeoffs were possible, though not with a full fuel and ammunition load.

The engines were unusually quiet because the exhausts were muffled by the General Electric turbosuperchargers on the twin Allison V-12s. Early problems with cockpit temperature regulation occurred; pilots were often too hot in the tropical sun, as the canopy could not be fully opened without severe buffeting, and were often too cold in Northern Europe and at high altitude, as the distance of the engines from the cockpit prevented easy heat transfer. Later variants received modifications (such as electrically heated flight suits) to solve these problems.

On 20 September 1939, before the YP-38s had been built and flight tested, the USAAC ordered 66 initial-production P-38 Lightnings, 30 of which were delivered to the (renamed) USAAF in mid-1941, but not all these aircraft were armed. The unarmed aircraft were subsequently fitted with four .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns (instead of the two .50 in/12.7 mm and two .30 in/7.62 mm of their predecessors) and a 37 mm (1.46 in) cannon. They also had armored glass, cockpit armor, and fluorescent instrument lighting. One was completed with a pressurized cabin on an experimental basis and designated XP-38A. Due to reports the USAAF was receiving from Europe, the remaining 36 in the batch were upgraded with small improvements such as self-sealing fuel tanks and enhanced armor protection to make them combat-capable. The USAAF specified that these 36 aircraft were to be designated P-38D. As a result, no P-38Bs or P-38Cs were designated. The P-38D&#x27;s main role was to work out bugs and give the USAAF experience with handling the type.
In March 1940, the French and British, through the Anglo-French Purchasing Committee, ordered 667 P-38s for US$100M, designated Model 322F for the French and Model 322B for the British. The aircraft was a variant of the P-38E. The overseas Allies wished for complete commonality of Allison engines with the large numbers of Curtiss P-40 Tomahawks both nations had on order, so they ordered the aircraft fitted with two right-handed engines (not counter-rotating) without turbosuperchargers. Performance was supposed to be at . After the fall of France in June 1940, the British took over the entire order and gave the aircraft the service name &quot;Lightning&quot;. By June 1941, the War Ministry had cause to reconsider their earlier aircraft specifications based on experience gathered in the Battle of Britain and the Blitz. British displeasure with the Lockheed order came to the fore in July, and on 5 August 1941, they modified the contract such that 143 aircraft would be delivered as previously ordered, to be known as &quot;Lightning (Mark) I&quot;, and 524 would be upgraded to US-standard P-38E specifications with a top speed of at guaranteed, to be called &quot;Lightning II&quot;, for British service. Later that summer, an RAF test pilot reported back from Burbank with a poor assessment of the &quot;tail flutter&quot; situation, and the British cancelled all but three of the 143 Lightning Is. As a loss around US$15M was involved, Lockheed reviewed their contracts and decided to hold the British to the original order. Negotiations grew bitter and stalled. Everything changed after Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, after which the United States government seized some 40 of the Model 322s for West Coast defense; subsequently, all British Lightnings were delivered to the USAAF starting in January 1942. The USAAF lent the RAF three of the aircraft, which were delivered by sea in March 1942 and were test flown no earlier than May at Cunliffe-Owen Aircraft Swaythling, the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) and the Royal Aircraft Establishment. The A&amp;AEE example was unarmed, lacked turbochargers, and restricted to , though the undercarriage was praised and flight on one engine described as comfortable. These three were subsequently returned to the USAAF, one in December 1942 and the others in July 1943. Of the remaining 140 Lightning Is, 19 were not modified and were designated by the USAAF as RP-322-I (&#x27;R&#x27; for &#x27;Restricted&#x27;, because noncounter-rotating propellers were considered more dangerous on takeoff), while 121 were converted to counter-rotating V-1710F-2 engines without turbosuperchargers and designated P-322-II. All 121 were used as advanced trainers; a few were still serving that role in 1945. A few RP-322s were later used as test-modification platforms such as for smoke-laying canisters. The RP-322 was a fairly fast aircraft below and well-behaved as a trainer.

Many of the British order of 524 Lightning IIs were fitted with stronger F-10 Allison engines as they became available, and all were given wing pylons for fuel tanks or bombs. The upgraded aircraft were deployed to the Pacific as USAAC F-5A reconnaissance or P-38G fighter models, the latter used with great effect in the operation that shot down Admiral Yamamoto in April 1943. Robert Petit&#x27;s G model named &quot;Miss Virginia&quot; was on that mission, borrowed by Rex Barber, who was later credited with the kill. Petit had already used &quot;Miss Virginia&quot; to defeat two Nakajima A6M2-N &quot;Rufe&quot; floatplanes in February and to heavily damage a Japanese submarine chaser in March, which he mistakenly claimed as a destroyer sunk. Murray &quot;Jim&quot; Shubin used a less-powerful F model he named &quot;Oriole&quot; to down five confirmed and possibly six Zeros over Guadalcanal in June 1943 to become ace in a day.

The British name was retained over Lockheed&#x27;s original name &quot;Atalanta&quot;, the swift-running Greek goddess, following the company tradition of using mythological and celestial figures.

===Range extension===
The strategic-bombing proponents within the USAAF, nicknamed the Bomber Mafia by their ideological opponents, had established in the early 1930s a policy against research to create long-range fighters, which they thought would not be practical; this kind of research was not to compete for bomber resources. Aircraft manufacturers understood that they would not be rewarded if they installed subsystems on their fighters to enable them to carry drop tanks to provide more fuel for extended range. Lieutenant Kelsey, acting against this policy, risked his career in late 1941 when he convinced Lockheed to incorporate such subsystems in the P-38E model, without putting his request in writing. Kelsey possibly was responding to Colonel George William Goddard&#x27;s observation that the US sorely needed a high-speed, long-range photo reconnaissance plane. Along with a change order specifying some P-38Es be produced with guns replaced by photoreconnaissance cameras, to be designated the F-4-1-LO, Lockheed began working out the problems of drop-tank design and incorporation. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, eventually about 100 P-38Es were sent to a modification center near Dallas, Texas, or to the new Lockheed assembly plant B-6 (today the Burbank Airport), to be fitted with four K-17 aerial photography cameras. All of these aircraft were also modified to be able to carry drop tanks. P-38Fs were modified, as well. Every Lightning from the P-38G onward was capable of being fitted with drop tanks straight off the assembly line.

In March 1942, General Arnold made an off-hand comment that the US could avoid the German U-boat menace by flying fighters to the UK rather than packing them onto ships. President Roosevelt pressed the point, emphasizing his interest in the solution. Arnold was likely aware of the flying radius extension work being done on the P-38, which by this time had seen success with small drop tanks in the range of , the difference in capacity being the result of subcontractor production variation. Arnold ordered further tests with larger drop tanks in the range of ; the results were reported by Kelsey as providing the P-38 with a ferrying range. Because of available supply, the smaller drop tanks were used to fly Lightnings to the UK, the plan called Operation Bolero.

Led by two Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses, the first seven P-38s, each carrying two small drop tanks, left Presque Isle Army Air Field in Maine on 23 June 1942 for RAF Heathfield in Scotland. Their first refueling stop was made in far northeast Canada at Goose Bay. The second stop was a rough airstrip in Greenland called Bluie West One, and the third refueling stop was in Iceland at Keflavik. Other P-38s followed this route, with some lost in mishaps, usually due to poor weather, low visibility, radio difficulties, and navigational errors. Nearly 200 of the P-38Fs (and a few modified Es) were successfully flown across the Atlantic in July–August 1942, making the P-38 the first USAAF fighter to reach Britain and the first fighter ever to be delivered across the Atlantic under its own power. Kelsey himself piloted one of the Lightnings, landing in Scotland on 25 July.

==Operational history==
The first unit to receive P-38s was the 1st Fighter Group. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the unit joined the 14th Pursuit Group in San Diego to provide West Coast defense.

===Entry to the war===
The first Lightning to see active service was the F-4 version, a P-38E in which the guns were replaced by four K17 cameras. They joined the 8th Photographic Squadron in Australia on 4 April 1942. Three F-4s were operated by the Royal Australian Air Force in this theater for a short period beginning in September 1942.

On 29 May 1942, 25 P-38s began operating in the Aleutian Islands in Alaska. The fighter&#x27;s long range made it well-suited to the campaign over the almost -long island chain, and it was flown there for the rest of the war. The Aleutians were some of the most rugged environments available for testing the new aircraft under combat conditions. More Lightnings were lost due to severe weather and other conditions than enemy action; cases occurred where Lightning pilots, mesmerized by flying for hours over gray seas under gray skies, simply flew into the water. On 9 August 1942, two P-38Es of the 343rd Fighter Group, 11th Air Force, at the end of a long-range patrol, happened upon a pair of Japanese Kawanishi H6K &quot;Mavis&quot; flying boats and destroyed them, making them the first Japanese aircraft to be shot down by Lightnings.

===European theater===
====North Africa and Italy====
After the Battle of Midway, the USAAF began redeploying fighter groups to Britain as part of Operation Bolero, and Lightnings of the 1st Fighter Group were flown across the Atlantic via Iceland. On 14 August 1942, Second Lieutenant Elza Shahan of the 27th Fighter Squadron, and Second Lieutenant Joseph Shaffer of the 33rd Squadron operating out of Iceland shot down a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor over the Atlantic. Shaffer, flying either a P-40C or a P-39, scored the first hit, causing a fire on the Condor; Shahan in his P-38F finished it off with a high-speed gunnery pass. This was the first Luftwaffe aircraft destroyed by the USAAF.

After 347 sorties with no enemy contact, the 1st and 14th Fighter Groups transferred from the UK to the 12th Air Force in North Africa as part of the force being built up for Operation Torch. The Lightning&#x27;s long range allowed the pilots to fly their fighters over the Bay of Biscay, skirting neutral Spain and Portugal to refuel in Morocco. The P-38s were initially based at Tafaroui Airfield in Algeria alongside P-40 Warhawks and the rest of the 12th Air Force. P-38s were first involved in North African combat operations on 11 November 1942. The first North African P-38 kill was on 22 November, when Lieutenant Mark Shipman of the 14th downed an Italian airplane with twin engines. Shipman later made two more kills – a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter and a very large Me 323 Gigant transport.

Early results in the Mediterranean theater of operations were mixed. Some P-38 pilots scored multiple kills to become aces, while many others were shot down due to inexperience or tactical strictures. Overall, the P-38 suffered its highest losses in the Mediterranean theater. The primary function of the P-38 in North Africa was to escort bombers, but the fighters also targeted transport aircraft, and later in the campaign, they were sometimes given ground-attack missions. When tied to bomber-escort duties, the P-38 squadrons were vulnerable to attack from above by German fighters, which selected the most advantageous position and timing. The initial tactical doctrine of the American units was for the P-38s to fly near the bombers at all times rather than to defend aggressively or to fly ahead and clear the airspace for the bombers, and many American pilots were downed because of this limitation. Losses mounted, and all available P-38s in the UK were flown over to North Africa to restore squadron strength. After this painful experience, the American leadership changed tactics, and in February 1943, the P-38s were given free rein in their battles.

The first German success against the P-38 was on 28 November 1942, when Bf 109 pilots of &quot;Jagdgeschwader&quot; 53 claimed seven Lightnings for no loss of their own. Further one-sided German victories were noted on several occasions through January 1943. The first P-38 pilots to achieve ace status were Virgil Smith of the 14th FG and Jack Illfrey of the 1st FG, both credited with five wins by 26 December. Smith got a sixth enemy aircraft on 28 December, but was killed two days later in a crash landing, likely after taking fire from &quot;Oberfeldwebel&quot; Herbert Rollwage of JG 53, who survived the war with at least 71 kills. This was Rollwage&#x27;s first victory over a P-38, and his 35th claim at the time.

The two squadrons of the 14th Fighter Group were reduced so badly in December 1942 that the 82nd FG was flown from the UK to North Africa to cover the shortage. The first kill by the 82nd was during a bomber-escort mission on 7 January 1943, when William J. &quot;Dixie&quot; Sloan broke formation and turned toward six attacking Bf 109s to shoot one of them down. Known for his maverick style, Sloan racked up 12 victories by July 1943. After another heavy toll in January 1943, 14th FG had to be withdrawn from the front to reorganize, with surviving pilots sent home and the few remaining Lightnings transferred to the 82nd. The 14th was out of action for three months, returning in May.

On 5 April 1943, 26 P-38Fs of the 82nd claimed 31 enemy aircraft destroyed, helping to establish air superiority in the area and allegedly earning it the German nickname &quot;der Gabelschwanz Teufel&quot; – the Fork-tailed Devil, coming from a recently downed German aviator, as described by &quot;Life&quot; in August 1943. However, the reliability of this attribution is doubtful, as the clear intent of the article was to rehabilitate the P-38&#x27;s reputation in the minds of the American public. No earlier independent or German attestation exists for this claim. The P-38s remained active in the Mediterranean for the rest of the war, continuing to deliver and receive damage in combat. On 30 August 1943, 13 P-38s were shot down by German and Italian fighters while escorting B-26 and B-17 bombers on raids against targets in Italy. On 2 September, 10 P-38s were shot down in combat with Bf 109s of JG 53, with four Bf 109s, including that of 67-victory ace Franz Schieß, who had been the leading &quot;Lightning killer&quot; in the Luftwaffe with 17 destroyed.

The Mediterranean theater had the first aerial combat between German fighters and P-38s. German fighter-pilot appraisal of the P-38 was mixed. Some observers dismissed the P-38 as an easy kill, while others gave it high praise, a deadly enemy worthy of respect. Johannes Steinhoff, commander of JG 77 in North Africa, said that the unit&#x27;s old Bf 109s were &quot;perhaps, a little faster&quot; than the P-38, but a dogfight with the twin-engined fighter was daunting because its turning radius was much smaller, and it could quickly get on the tail of the Bf 109. Franz Stigler, an ace with 28 kills, flew Bf 109s against the P-38 in North Africa. Stigler said the Lightning &quot;could turn inside us with ease and they could go from level flight to climb almost instantaneously. We lost quite a few pilots who tried to make an attack and then pull up... One cardinal rule we never forgot was to avoid fighting the P-38 head on. That was suicide.&quot; Stigler said the best defense was to flick-roll the Bf 109 and dive, as the Lightning was slow in the first 10° of roll, and it was not as fast in a dive. Herbert Kaiser, eventually a 68-kill ace, shot down his first P-38 in January 1943. Kaiser said that the P-38 should be respected as a formidable opponent, that it was faster and more maneuverable than the Bf 109G-6 model he flew, especially since the G-6 was slowed by underwing cannon pods. Johann Pichler, another high-scoring ace, said that the P-38 in 1943 was much faster in a climb than the Bf 109. Kurt Bühligen, third-highest scoring German pilot on the Western front with 112 victories, recalled: &quot;The P-38 fighter (and the B-24) were easy to burn. Once in Africa, we were six, and met eight P-38s and shot down seven. One sees a great distance in Africa and our observers and flak people called in sightings and we could get altitude first and they were low and slow.&quot; &quot;General der Jagdflieger&quot; Adolf Galland was unimpressed with the P-38, declaring, &quot;it had similar shortcomings in combat to our Bf 110, our fighters were clearly superior to it.&quot; Heinz Bäer said that P-38s &quot;were not difficult at all. They were easy to outmaneuver and were generally a sure kill&quot;.

On 12 June 1943, a P-38G, while flying a special mission between Gibraltar and Malta, or perhaps, just after strafing the radar station of Capo Pula, landed on the airfield of Capoterra (Cagliari), in Sardinia, from navigation error due to a compass failure. &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; chief test pilot &quot;Colonnello&quot; (Lieutenant Colonel) Angelo Tondi flew the captured aircraft to Guidonia airfield, where the P-38G was evaluated. On 11 August 1943, Tondi took off to intercept a formation of about 50 bombers, returning from the bombing of Terni (Umbria). Tondi attacked B-17G &quot;Bonny Sue&quot;, 42–30307, that fell off the shore of Torvaianica, near Rome, while six airmen parachuted out. According to US sources, he also damaged three more bombers on that occasion. On 4 September, the 301st BG reported the loss of B-17 &quot;The Lady Evelyn,&quot; 42–30344, downed by &quot;an enemy P-38&quot;. War missions for that plane were limited, as the Italian petrol was too corrosive for the Lockheed&#x27;s tanks. Other Lightnings were eventually acquired by Italy for postwar service.
In a particular case when faced by more agile fighters at low altitudes in a constricted valley, Lightnings suffered heavy losses. On the morning of 10 June 1944, 96 P-38Js of the 1st and 82nd Fighter Groups took off from Italy for Ploiești, the third-most heavily defended target in Europe, after Berlin and Vienna. Instead of bombing from high altitude as had been tried by the Fifteenth Air Force, USAAF planning had determined that a dive-bombing surprise attack, beginning at about with bomb release at or below , performed by 46 82nd Fighter Group P-38s, each carrying one bomb, would yield more accurate results. All of 1st Fighter Group and a few aircraft in 82nd Fighter Group were to fly cover, and all fighters were to strafe targets of opportunity on the return trip, a distance of some , including a circuitous outward route made in an attempt to achieve surprise. Some 85 or 86 fighters arrived in Romania to find enemy airfields alerted, with a wide assortment of aircraft scrambling for safety. P-38s shot down several, including heavy fighters, transports, and observation aircraft. At Ploiești, defense forces were fully alert, the target was concealed by smoke screen, and antiaircraft fire was very heavy; seven Lightnings were lost to antiaircraft fire at the target, and two more during strafing attacks on the return flight. German Bf 109 fighters from I./JG 53 and 2./JG 77 fought the Americans. Sixteen P-38s, called &quot;Indieni cu două pene&quot; (Indians with two feathers) by the Romanians, of the 71st Fighter Squadron were challenged by a large formation of Romanian IAR.81C fighters of the 6th Fighter Group. The fight took place below in a narrow valley and lasted 12 minutes. Herbert Hatch saw two IAR 81Cs that he misidentified as Focke-Wulf Fw 190s hit the ground after taking fire from his guns, and his fellow pilots confirmed three more of his kills. Three of his victories were confirmed by gun camera. The outnumbered 71st Fighter Squadron took more damage than it dished out, though, losing nine aircraft. In all, the USAAF lost 22 aircraft on the mission. The Americans claimed 23 aerial victories. The Romanians and Germans lost five Bf 110s, four Ju 52s, and one Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 on the ground, as well as three Focke-Wulf Fw 58s, three IAR 38s, and three IAR.81Cs in the air. Eleven enemy locomotives were strafed and left burning, and flak emplacements were destroyed, along with fuel trucks and other targets. Results of the bombing were not observed by the USAAF pilots because of the smoke. The dive-bombing mission profile was not repeated, though the 82nd Fighter Group was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its part.

====Western Europe====
Experiences over Germany had shown a need for long-range escort fighters to protect the Eighth Air Force&#x27;s heavy-bomber operations. The P-38Hs of the 55th Fighter Group were transferred to the Eighth in England in September 1943, and were joined by the 20th Fighter Group, 364th Fighter Group, and 479th Fighter Group soon after. P-38s and Spitfires escorted Flying Fortress raids over Europe.

Because its distinctive shape was less prone to cases of mistaken identity and friendly fire, Lieutenant General Jimmy Doolittle, commander of the 8th Air Force, chose to pilot a P-38 during the invasion of Normandy, so he could watch the progress of the air offensive over France. At one point in the mission, Doolittle flick-rolled through a hole in the cloud cover, but his wingman, then–Major General Earle E. Partridge, was looking elsewhere and failed to notice Doolittle&#x27;s quick maneuver, leaving Doolittle to continue on alone on his survey of the crucial battle. Of the P-38, Doolittle said that it was &quot;the sweetest-flying plane in the sky&quot;.

A little-known role of the P-38 in the European theater was that of fighter-bomber during the invasion of Normandy and the Allied advance across France into Germany. Assigned to the IX Tactical Air Command, the 370th Fighter Group and 474th Fighter Group and their P-38s initially flew missions from England, dive-bombing radar installations, enemy armor, troop concentrations, and flak towers, and providing air cover. The 370th&#x27;s group commander Howard F. Nichols and a squadron of his P-38 Lightnings attacked Field Marshal Günther von Kluge&#x27;s headquarters in July 1944; Nichols himself skipped a bomb through the front door. The 370th later operated from Cardonville, France, and the 474th from various bases in France, flying ground-attack missions against gun emplacements, troops, supply dumps, and tanks near Saint-Lô in July and in the Falaise–Argentan area in August 1944. The 370th participated in ground-attack missions across Europe until February 1945, when the unit changed over to the P-51 Mustang. The 474th operated out of bases in France, Belgium, and Germany in primarily the ground-attack missions until November–December 1945.

After some disastrous raids in 1944 with B-17s escorted by P-38s and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts, Doolittle, then head of the U.S. Eighth Air Force, went to the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough, asking for an evaluation of the various American fighters. Test pilot Captain Eric Brown, Fleet Air Arm, recalled:

We had found out that the Bf 109 and the FW 190 could fight up to a Mach of 0.75, three-quarters the speed of sound. We checked the Lightning and it couldn&#x27;t fly in combat faster than 0.68. So, it was useless. We told Doolittle that all it was good for was photoreconnaissance and had to be withdrawn from escort duties. And the funny thing is that the Americans had great difficulty understanding this because the Lightning had the two top aces in the Far East.

After evaluation tests at Farnborough, the P-38 was kept in fighting service in Europe for a while longer. Although many failings were remedied with the introduction of the P-38J, by September 1944, all but one of the Lightning groups in the Eighth Air Force had converted to the P-51 Mustang. The Eighth Air Force continued to conduct reconnaissance missions using the F-5 variant.

===Pacific theater===
The P-38 was used most extensively and successfully in the Pacific theater, where it proved more suited, combining exceptional range with the reliability of two engines for long missions over water. The P-38 was used in a variety of roles, especially escorting bombers at altitudes of . The P-38 was credited with destroying more Japanese aircraft than any other USAAF fighter. Freezing cockpit temperatures were not a problem at low altitude in the tropics. In fact, the cockpit was often too hot, since opening a window while in flight caused buffeting by setting up turbulence through the tailplane. Pilots taking low-altitude assignments often flew stripped down to shorts, tennis shoes, and parachute. While the P-38 could not out-turn the A6M Zero and most other Japanese fighters when flying below , its superior speed coupled with a good rate of climb meant that it could use energy tactics, making multiple high-speed passes at its target. In addition, its tightly grouped guns were even more deadly to lightly armored Japanese warplanes than to German aircraft. The concentrated, parallel stream of bullets allowed aerial victory at much longer distances than fighters carrying wing guns. Dick Bong, the United States&#x27; highest-scoring World War II air ace (40 victories in P-38s), flew directly at his targets to ensure he hit them, in some cases flying through the debris of his target (and on one occasion colliding with an enemy aircraft, which was claimed as a &quot;probable&quot; victory). The twin Allison engines performed admirably in the Pacific.

General George C. Kenney, commander of the USAAF 5th Air Force operating in New Guinea, could not get enough P-38s; they had become his favorite fighter in November 1942 when one squadron, the 39th Fighter Squadron of the 35th Fighter Group, joined his assorted P-39s and P-40s. The Lightnings established local air superiority with their first combat action on 27 December 1942. Kenney sent repeated requests to Arnold for more P-38s, and was rewarded with occasional shipments, but Europe was a higher priority in Washington. Despite their small force, Lightning pilots began to compete in racking up scores against Japanese aircraft.

On 2–4 March 1943, P-38s flew top cover for 5th Air Force and Australian bombers and attack aircraft during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, in which eight Japanese troop transports and four escorting destroyers were sunk. Two P-38 aces from the 39th Fighter Squadron were killed on the second day of the battle: Bob Faurot and Hoyt &quot;Curley&quot; Eason (a veteran with five victories who had trained hundreds of pilots, including Dick Bong). In one notable engagement on 3 March 1943, P-38s escorted 13 B-17s (part of an attack including B-25 Mitchells and Beaufighters) as they bombed the Japanese convoy from a medium altitude of , which dispersed the convoy formation and reduced their concentrated antiaircraft firepower. A B-17 was shot down and when Japanese Zero fighters machine-gunned some of the B-17 crew members who bailed out in parachutes, three P-38s promptly dived into action, claiming five Zeros.

====Killing of Admiral Yamamoto====

Because of its ability to fly long distances, the Lightning figured in one of the most significant operations in the Pacific Theater – the interception, on 18 April 1943, of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the architect of Japan&#x27;s naval strategy in the Pacific including the attack on Pearl Harbor. When American codebreakers found out that he was flying to Bougainville Island to conduct a front-line inspection, 16 P-38G Lightnings were sent on a long-range fighter-intercept mission, flying from Guadalcanal at heights of above the ocean to avoid detection. The Lightnings met Yamamoto&#x27;s two Mitsubishi G4M &quot;Betty&quot; fast bomber transports and six escorting Zeros just as they arrived at the island. The first Betty crashed in the jungle and the second ditched near the coast. The Americans lost one P-38. Japanese search parties found Yamamoto&#x27;s body at the jungle crash site the next day.

===Service record===

The P-38&#x27;s service record shows mixed results, which may reflect more on its employment than on flaws with the aircraft. The P-38&#x27;s engine troubles at high altitudes only occurred with the Eighth Air Force. One reason for this was the inadequate cooling systems of the G and H models; the improved P-38 J and L had tremendous success flying out of Italy into Germany at all altitudes. Until the -J-25 variant, P-38s were easily avoided by German fighters because of the lack of dive flaps to counter compressibility in dives. German fighter pilots not wishing to fight would perform the first half of a Split S and continue into steep dives because they knew the Lightnings would be reluctant to follow.

On the positive side, having two engines was a built-in insurance policy. Many pilots arrived safely back to base after having an engine failure en route or in combat. On 3 March 1944, the first Allied fighters reached Berlin on a frustrated escort mission. Lieutenant Colonel Jack Jenkins of 55th Fighter Group led the group of P-38H pilots, arriving with only half his force after flak damage and engine trouble took their toll. On the way into Berlin, Jenkins reported one rough-running engine, causing him to wonder if he would ever make it back. The B-17s he was supposed to escort never showed up, having turned back at Hamburg. Jenkins and his wingman were able to drop tanks and outrun enemy fighters to return home with three good engines between them.
In the European theater, P-38s made 130,000 sorties with a loss of 1.3% overall, comparing favorably with P-51s, which posted a 1.1% loss, considering that the P-38s were vastly outnumbered and suffered from poorly thought-out tactics. Most of the P-38 sorties were made in the period prior to Allied air superiority in Europe, when pilots fought against a very determined and skilled enemy. Lieutenant Colonel Mark Hubbard, a vocal critic of the aircraft, rated it the third-best Allied fighter in Europe. The Lightning&#x27;s greatest virtues were long range, heavy payload, high speed, fast climb, and concentrated firepower. The P-38 was a formidable fighter, interceptor, and attack aircraft.

In the Pacific Theater, the P-38 downed over 1,800 Japanese aircraft, with more than 100 pilots becoming aces by downing five or more enemy aircraft. American fuel supplies contributed to a better engine performance and maintenance record, and range was increased with leaner mixtures. In the second half of 1944, the P-38L pilots out of Dutch New Guinea were flying , fighting for 15 minutes and returning to base. Such long legs were invaluable until the P-47N and P-51D entered service.

===Postwar operations===
The end of the war left the USAAF with thousands of P-38s rendered obsolete by the jet age. Orders for 1,887 more were cancelled. The last P-38s in service with the United States Air Force were retired in 1949. One-hundred late-model P-38L and F-5 Lightnings were acquired by Italy through an agreement dated April 1946. Delivered, after refurbishing, at the rate of one per month, they finally were all sent to the Aeronautica Militare by 1952. The Lightnings served in the 4° &quot;Stormo&quot; and other units including 3° &quot;Stormo&quot;, flying reconnaissance over the Balkans, ground attack, naval cooperation, and air-superiority missions. Due to old engines, pilot errors, and lack of experience in operations, large numbers of P-38s were lost in at least 30 accidents, many of them fatal. Despite this, many Italian pilots liked the P-38 because of its excellent visibility on the ground and stability on takeoff. The Italian P-38s were phased out in 1956; none survived the scrapyard.

Surplus P-38s were also used by other foreign air forces, with 12 sold to Honduras and 15 retained by China. Six F-5s and two unarmed black two-seater P-38s were operated by the Dominican Air Force based in San Isidro Airbase, Dominican Republic, in 1947. Most of the wartime Lightnings present in the continental U.S. at the end of the war were put up for sale for US$1,200 apiece; the rest were scrapped. P-38s in distant theaters of war were bulldozed into piles and abandoned or scrapped; very few avoided that fate.

The CIA &quot;Liberation Air Force&quot; flew one P-38M to support the 1954 Guatemalan &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot;. On 27 June 1954, this aircraft dropped napalm bombs that destroyed the British cargo ship , which was loading Guatemalan cotton and coffee for Grace Line in Puerto San José. In 1957, five Honduran P-38s bombed and strafed a village occupied by Nicaraguan forces during a border dispute between these two countries concerning part of Gracias a Dios Department.

P-38s were popular contenders in the air races from 1946 through 1949, with brightly colored Lightnings making screaming turns around the pylons at Reno and Cleveland. Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier was among those who bought a Lightning, choosing a P-38J model and painting it red to make it stand out as an air racer and stunt flyer. Lefty Gardner, former B-24 and B-17 pilot and associate of the Confederate Air Force, bought a mid-1944 P-38L-1-LO that had been modified into an F-5G. Gardner painted it white with red and blue trim and named it &quot;White Lightnin″&quot;; he reworked its turbo systems and intercoolers for optimum low-altitude performance and gave it P-38F-style air intakes for better streamlining. &quot;White Lightnin″&quot; was severely damaged in a crash landing following an engine fire on a transit flight, and was bought and restored with a brilliant polished-aluminum finish by the company that owns Red Bull. The aircraft is now located in Austria.

F-5s were bought by aerial survey companies and employed for mapping. From the 1950s on, the use of the Lightning steadily declined, and only a few more than two dozen still exist, with few still flying. One example is a P-38L owned by the Lone Star Flight Museum in Galveston, Texas, painted in the colors of Charles H. MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;Putt Putt Maru&quot;. Two other examples are F-5Gs, which were owned and operated by Kargl Aerial Surveys in 1946, and are now located in Chino, California, at Yanks Air Museum, and in McMinnville, Oregon, at Evergreen Aviation Museum. The earliest-built surviving P-38, &quot;Glacier Girl&quot;, was recovered from the Greenland ice cap in 1992, 50 years after she crashed there on a ferry flight to the UK, and after a complete restoration, flew once again 10 years after her recovery.

==Production==
Over 10,000 Lightnings were manufactured, becoming the only U.S. combat aircraft that remained in continuous production throughout the duration of American participation in World War II. The Lightning had a major effect on other aircraft; its wing, in a scaled-up form, was used on the Lockheed Constellation.

===P-38D and P-38Es===
Delivered and accepted Lightning production variants began with the P-38D model. The few &quot;handmade&quot; YP-38s initially contracted were used as trainers and test aircraft. No Bs or Cs were delivered to the government as the USAAF allocated the &#x27;D&#x27; suffix to all aircraft with self-sealing fuel tanks and armor. Many secondary but still initial teething tests were conducted using the earliest D variants.

The first combat-capable Lightning was the P-38E (and its photo-recon variant the F-4) which featured improved instruments, electrical, and hydraulic systems. Part-way through production, the older Hamilton Standard Hydromatic hollow steel propellers were replaced by new Curtiss Electric duraluminum propellers. The definitive (and now famous) armament configuration was settled upon, featuring four .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns with 500 rpg, and a 20 mm (.79 in) Hispano autocannon with 150 rounds.

While the machine guns had been arranged symmetrically in the nose on the P-38D, they were &quot;staggered&quot; in the P-38E and later versions, with the muzzles protruding from the nose in the relative lengths of roughly 1:4:6:2. This was done to ensure a straight ammunition-belt feed into the weapons, as the earlier arrangement led to jamming.

The first P-38E rolled out of the factory in October 1941 as the Battle of Moscow filled the news wires of the world. Because of the versatility, redundant engines, and especially high-speed and high-altitude characteristics of the aircraft, as with later variants, over 100 P-38Es were completed in the factory or converted in the field to a photoreconnaissance variant, the F-4, in which the guns were replaced by four cameras. Most of these early reconnaissance Lightnings were retained stateside for training, but the F-4 was the first Lightning to be used in action in April 1942.

===P-38Fs and P-38Gs===
After 210 P-38Es were built, they were followed, starting in February 1942, by the P-38F, which incorporated racks inboard of the engines for fuel tanks or a total of of bombs. Early variants did not have a high reputation for maneuverability, though they could be agile at low altitudes if flown by a capable pilot, using the P-38&#x27;s forgiving stall characteristics to their best advantage. From the P-38F-15 model onwards, a &quot;combat maneuver&quot; setting was added to the P-38&#x27;s Fowler flaps. When deployed at the 8° maneuver setting, the flaps allowed the P-38 to out-turn many contemporary single-engined fighters at the cost of some added drag. However, early variants were hampered by high aileron control forces and a low initial rate of roll, and all such features required a pilot to gain experience with the aircraft, which in part was an additional reason Lockheed sent its representative to England, and later to the Pacific theater.

The aircraft was still experiencing extensive teething troubles, as well as being victimized by &quot;urban legends&quot;, mostly involving inapplicable twin-engined factors which had been designed out of the aircraft by Lockheed. In addition to these, the early versions had a reputation as a &quot;widow maker&quot;, as they could enter an unrecoverable dive due to a sonic surface effect at high subsonic speeds. The 527 P-38Fs were heavier, with more powerful engines that used more fuel, and were unpopular in the air war in Northern Europe. Since the heavier engines were having reliability problems and with them, without external fuel tanks, the range of the P-38F was reduced, and since drop tanks themselves were in short supply as the fortunes in the Battle of the Atlantic had not yet swung the Allies&#x27; way, the aircraft became relatively unpopular in minds of the bomber command planning staffs despite being the longest-ranged fighter first available to the 8th Air Force in sufficient numbers for long-range escort duties. Nonetheless, General Spaatz, then commander of the 8th Air Force in the UK, said of the P-38F: &quot;I&#x27;d rather have an airplane that goes like hell and has a few things wrong with it, than one that won&#x27;t go like hell and has a few things wrong with it.&quot;
The P-38F was followed in June 1942 by the P-38G, using more powerful Allisons of each and equipped with a better radio. A dozen of the planned P-38G production were set aside to serve as prototypes for what became the P-38J with further uprated Allison V-1710F-17 engines ( each) in redesigned booms, which featured chin-mounted intercoolers in place of the original system in the leading edge of the wings and more efficient radiators. Lockheed subcontractors, however, were initially unable to supply both of Burbank&#x27;s twin production lines with a sufficient quantity of new core intercoolers and radiators. War Production Board planners were unwilling to sacrifice production, and one of the two remaining prototypes received the new engines, but retained the old leading-edge intercoolers and radiators.

As the P-38H, 600 of these stop-gap Lightnings with an improved 20 mm cannon and a bomb capacity of were produced on one line beginning in May 1943, while the near-definitive P-38J began production on the second line in August 1943. The Eighth Air Force was experiencing high-altitude and cold-weather issues, which while not unique to the aircraft, were perhaps more severe as the turbosuperchargers upgrading the Allisons were having their own reliability issues, making the aircraft more unpopular with senior officers out of the line. This was a situation unduplicated on all other fronts, where the commands were clamoring for as many P-38s as they could get. Both the P-38G and P-38H models&#x27; performances were restricted by an intercooler system integral to the wing&#x27;s leading edge, which had been designed for the YP-38&#x27;s less powerful engines. At the higher boost levels, the new engine&#x27;s charge air temperature would increase above the limits recommended by Allison and would be subject to detonation if operated at high power for extended periods of time. Reliability was not the only issue, either. For example, the reduced power settings required by the P-38H did not allow the maneuvering flap to be used to good advantage at high altitude. All these problems really came to a head in the unplanned P-38H and sped the Lightning&#x27;s eventual replacement in the 8th Air Force; fortunately, the 15th Air Force was glad to get them.

Some P-38G production was diverted on the assembly line to F-5A reconnaissance aircraft. An F-5A was modified to an experimental two-seat reconnaissance configuration as the XF-5D, with a Plexiglas nose, two machine guns, and additional cameras in the tail booms.

===P-38J, P-38L===
The P-38J was introduced in August 1943. The turbosupercharger intercooler system on previous variants had been housed in the leading edges of the wings and had proven vulnerable to combat damage and could burst if the wrong series of controls was mistakenly activated. In the P-38J series, the streamlined engine nacelles of previous Lightnings were changed to fit the intercooler radiator between the oil coolers, forming a &quot;chin&quot; that visually distinguished the J model from its predecessors. While the P-38J used the same V-1710-89/91 engines as the H model, the new core-type intercooler more efficiently lowered intake manifold temperatures and permitted a substantial increase in rated power. The leading edge of the outer wing was fitted with fuel tanks, filling the space formerly occupied by intercooler tunnels, but these were omitted on early P-38J blocks due to limited availability.

The final 210 J models, designated P-38J-25-LO, alleviated the compressibility problem through the addition of a set of electrically actuated dive recovery flaps just outboard of the engines on the bottom centerline of the wings. With these improvements, a USAAF pilot reported a dive speed of almost , although the indicated air speed was later corrected for compressibility error, and the actual dive speed was lower. Lockheed manufactured over 200 retrofit modification kits to be installed on P-38J-10-LO and J-20-LO already in Europe, but the USAAF C-54 carrying them was shot down by an RAF pilot who mistook the Douglas transport for a German Focke-Wulf Condor. Unfortunately, the loss of the kits came during Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier&#x27;s four-month morale-boosting tour of P-38 bases. Flying a new Lightning named &quot;Snafuperman&quot;, modified to full P-38J-25-LO specifications at Lockheed&#x27;s modification center near Belfast, LeVier captured the pilots&#x27; full attention by routinely performing maneuvers during March 1944 that common 8th Air Force wisdom held to be suicidal. It proved too little, too late, because the decision had already been made to re-equip with Mustangs.

The P-38J-25-LO production block also introduced hydraulically boosted ailerons, one of the first times such a system was fitted to a fighter. This significantly improved the Lightning&#x27;s rate of roll and reduced control forces for the pilot. This production block and the following P-38L model are considered the definitive Lightnings, and Lockheed ramped up production, working with subcontractors across the country to produce hundreds of Lightnings each month.

The P-38L was the most numerous variant of the Lightning, with 3,923 built, 113 by Consolidated-Vultee in their Nashville plant. It entered service with the USAAF in June 1944, in time to support the Allied invasion of France on D-Day. Lockheed production of the Lightning was distinguished by a suffix consisting of a production block number followed by &quot;LO,&quot; for example &quot;P-38L-1-LO&quot;, while Consolidated-Vultee production was distinguished by a block number followed by &quot;VN,&quot; for example &quot;P-38L-5-VN.&quot;

The P-38L was the first Lightning fitted with zero-length rocket launchers. Seven high-velocity aircraft rockets (HVARs) on pylons were placed beneath each wing, and later, five HVARs were on each wing on &quot;Christmas tree&quot; launch racks, which added to the aircraft. The P-38L also had strengthened stores pylons to allow carriage of bombs or drop tanks.

Lockheed modified 200 P-38J airframes in production to become unarmed F-5B photo-reconnaissance aircraft, while hundreds of other P-38Js and P-38Ls were modified at Lockheed&#x27;s Dallas Modification Center to become F-5Cs, F-5Es, F-5Fs, or F-5Gs. A few P-38Ls were field modified to become two-seat TP-38L familiarization trainers. During and after June 1948, the remaining J and L variants were designated ZF-38J and ZF-38L, with the &quot;ZF&quot; designator (meaning &quot;obsolete fighter&quot;) replacing the &quot;P for Pursuit&quot; category.

Late-model Lightnings were delivered unpainted, per USAAF policy established in 1944. At first, field units tried to paint them, since pilots worried about being too visible to the enemy, but the reduction in weight and drag turned out to be a minor advantage in combat.

The P-38L-5, the most common subvariant of the P-38L, had a modified cockpit heating system consisting of a plug-socket in the cockpit into which the pilot could plug his heat-suit wire for improved comfort. These Lightnings also received the uprated V-1710-112/113 (F30R/L) engines, and this dramatically lowered the number of engine-failure problems experienced at high altitude so commonly associated with European operations.

===P-38K===
Two P-38Ks were developed from 1942 to 1943, one official and one an internal Lockheed experiment. The first was actually a battered RP-38E &quot;piggyback&quot; test mule previously used by Lockheed to test the P-38J chin intercooler installation, now fitted with paddle-bladed &quot;high-activity&quot; Hamilton Standard Hydromatic propellers similar to those used on the P-47. The new propellers required spinners of greater diameter, and the mule&#x27;s crude, hand-formed sheet steel cowlings were further stretched to blend the spinners into the nacelles. It retained its &quot;piggyback&quot; configuration that allowed an observer to ride behind the pilot. With Lockheed&#x27;s AAF representative as a passenger and the maneuvering flap deployed to offset Army Hot Day conditions, the old &quot;K-Mule&quot; still climbed to . With a fresh coat of paint covering its crude, hand-formed steel cowlings, this RP-38E acts as stand-in for the &quot;P-38K-1-LO&quot; in the model&#x27;s only picture.

The 12th G model originally set aside as a P-38J prototype was redesignated P-38K-1-LO and fitted with the aforementioned paddle-blade propellers and new Allison V-1710-75/77 (F15R/L) powerplants rated at at War Emergency Power. These engines were geared 2.36 to 1, unlike the standard P-38 ratio of 2 to 1. The AAF took delivery in September 1943, at Eglin Field. In tests, the P-38K-1 achieved at military power and was predicted to exceed at War Emergency Power with a similar increase in load and range. The initial climb rate was /min and the ceiling was . It reached in five minutes flat; this with a coat of camouflage paint, which added weight and drag. Although it was judged superior in climb and speed to the latest and best fighters from all AAF manufacturers, the War Production Board refused to authorize P-38K production due to the two- to three-week interruption in production necessary to implement cowling modifications for the revised spinners and higher thrust line. Some had also doubted Allison&#x27;s ability to deliver the F15 engine in quantity. As promising as it had looked, the P-38K project came to a halt.

===Pathfinders, night-fighter, and other variants===

The Lightning was modified for other roles. In addition to the F-4 and F-5 reconnaissance variants, several P-38Js and P-38Ls were field modified as formation bombing &quot;pathfinders&quot; or &quot;droopsnoots&quot;, fitted with a Norden bombsight or an H2X radar system. Such pathfinders would lead a formation of other P-38s, each loaded with two bombs; the entire formation releasing their ordnance when the pathfinder did.

A number of Lightnings were modified as night fighters. Several field or experimental modifications with different equipment fits finally led to the &quot;formal&quot; P-38M night fighter, or &quot;Night Lightning&quot;. In total, 75 P-38Ls were modified to the Night Lightning configuration, painted flat-black with conical flash hiders on the guns, an AN/APS-6 radar pod below the nose, and a second cockpit with a raised canopy behind the pilot&#x27;s canopy for the radar operator. The headroom in the rear cockpit was limited, requiring radar operators who were preferably short in stature.

One of the initial-production P-38s had its turbosuperchargers removed, with a secondary cockpit placed in one of the booms to examine how flight crews would respond to such an &quot;asymmetric&quot; cockpit layout. One P-38E was fitted with an extended central nacelle to accommodate a tandem-seat cockpit with dual controls, and was later fitted with a laminar-flow wing.

Very early in the Pacific War, a scheme was proposed to fit Lightnings with floats to allow them to make long-range ferry flights. The floats would be removed before the aircraft went into combat. Concerns arose that saltwater spray would corrode the tailplane, so in March 1942, P-38E 41-1986 was modified with a tailplane raised some , booms lengthened by 2 ft, and a rearward-facing second seat added for an observer to monitor the effectiveness of the new arrangement. A second version was crafted on the same airframe with the twin booms given greater sideplane area to augment the vertical rudders. This arrangement was removed and a final third version was fabricated that had the booms returned to normal length, but the tail raised . All three tail modifications were designed by George H. &quot;Bert&quot; Estabrook. The final version was used for a quick series of dive tests on 7 December 1942 in which Milo Burcham performed the test maneuvers and Kelly Johnson observed from the rear seat. Johnson concluded that the raised floatplane tail gave no advantage in solving the problem of compressibility. At no time was this P-38E testbed airframe actually fitted with floats, and the idea was quickly abandoned, as the U.S. Navy proved to have enough sealift capacity to keep up with P-38 deliveries to the South Pacific.

Still another P-38E was used in 1942 to tow a Waco troop glider as a demonstration. However, there proved to be plenty of other aircraft, such as Douglas C-47 Skytrains, available to tow gliders, and the Lightning was spared this duty.

Standard Lightnings were used as crew and cargo transports in the South Pacific. They were fitted with pods attached to the underwing pylons, replacing drop tanks or bombs, that could carry a single passenger in a lying-down position, or cargo. This was a very uncomfortable way to fly. Some of the pods were not even fitted with a window to let the passenger see out or bring in light.

Lockheed proposed a carrier-based Model 822 version of the Lightning for the US Navy. The Model 822 would have featured folding wings, an arresting hook, and stronger undercarriage for carrier operations. The Navy was not interested, as they regarded the Lightning as too big for carrier operations and did not like liquid-cooled engines; therefore, the Model 822 never went beyond the paper stage. The Navy did operate, though, four land-based F-5Bs in North Africa, inherited from the USAAF and redesignated FO-1.

A P-38J was used in experiments with an unusual scheme for midair refueling, in which the fighter snagged a drop tank trailed on a cable from a bomber. The USAAF managed to make this work, but decided it was not practical. A P-38J was also fitted with experimental retractable snow-ski landing gear, but this idea never reached operational service, either.

After the war, a P-38L was experimentally fitted with armament of three .60 in (15.2 mm) machine guns. The .60 in (15.2 mm) caliber cartridge had been developed early in the war for an infantry antitank rifle, a type of weapon developed by a number of nations in the 1930s when tanks were lighter, but by 1942, armor was too tough for this caliber.

Another P-38L was modified after the war as a &quot;super strafer&quot;, with eight .50 in (12.7 mm) machine guns in the nose and a pod under each wing with two .50 in (12.7 mm) guns, for a total of 12 machine guns. Nothing came of this conversion, either.

==Noted P-38s==
===&quot;Yippee&quot;===
The 5,000th Lightning built, a P-38J-20-LO, &quot;44-23296&quot;, was painted bright vermilion red, and had the name &quot;YIPPEE&quot; painted on the underside of the wings in large white letters, as well as the signatures of hundreds of factory workers. This and other aircraft were used by a handful of Lockheed test pilots including Milo Burcham, Jimmie Mattern, and Tony LeVier in remarkable flight demonstrations, performing such stunts as slow rolls at treetop level with one prop feathered to dispel the myth that the P-38 was unmanageable.

==Surviving aircraft==
Of the ten thousand aircraft built, there are 26 survivors of which ten are airworthy.

==Noted P-38 pilots==

===Richard Bong and Thomas McGuire===
The American ace of aces and his closest competitor both flew Lightnings and tallied 40 and 38 victories, respectively. Majors Richard I. &quot;Dick&quot; Bong and Thomas B. &quot;Tommy&quot; McGuire of the USAAF competed for the top position. Both men were awarded the Medal of Honor.

McGuire was killed in air combat in January 1945 over the Philippines, after accumulating 38 confirmed kills, making him the second-ranking American ace. Bong was rotated back to the United States as America&#x27;s ace of aces, after making 40 kills, becoming a test pilot. He was killed on 6 August 1945, the day the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan, when his Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star jet fighter flamed out on take-off.

===Charles Lindbergh===
Charles Lindbergh became famous for his transatlantic solo flight before the war. By WWII he was a civilian working for Vought in the South Pacific area. He received preferential treatment as if a visiting colonel. 
In Hollandia, Lindbergh attached himself to the 475th Fighter Group which was flying P-38s. Although new to the aircraft, Lindbergh was instrumental in extending the range of the P-38 through improved throttle settings, or engine-leaning techniques, notably by reducing engine speed to 1,600 rpm, setting the carburetors for auto-lean and flying at indicated airspeed, which reduced fuel consumption to 70 gal/h, about 2.6 mpg. This combination of settings had been considered dangerous as it was believed this would upset the fuel mixture, causing an explosion.

While with the 475th, he took part in a number of combat missions. On 28 July 1944, Lindbergh shot down a Mitsubishi Ki-51 &quot;Sonia&quot; flown by the veteran commander of the 73rd Independent Flying Chutai of the Imperial Japanese Army Captain Saburo Shimada. In an extended, twisting dogfight in which many of the participants ran out of ammunition, Shimada turned his aircraft directly toward Lindbergh, who was just approaching the combat area. Lindbergh fired in a defensive reaction brought on by Shimada&#x27;s apparent head-on ramming attack. Hit by cannon and machine-gun fire, the &quot;Sonia&#x27;s&quot; propeller visibly slowed, but Shimada held his course. Lindbergh pulled up at the last moment to avoid collision as the damaged &quot;Sonia&quot; went into a steep dive, hit the ocean, and sank. The unofficial kill was not entered in the 475th&#x27;s war record. On 12 August 1944, Lindbergh left Hollandia to return to the United States.

===Charles MacDonald===

The third-ranking American ace of the Pacific theater, Charles H. MacDonald, flew a Lightning against the Japanese and scored 27 kills in his aircraft, the &quot;Putt Putt Maru&quot;.

===Martin James Monti===

Martin James Monti was an American pilot who defected to the Axis powers in a stolen F-5E Lightning, which was handed over to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; &quot;Zirkus Rosarius&quot; for testing afterward.

===Robin Olds===

Robin Olds was the last P-38 ace in the 8th Air Force and the last in the ETO. Flying a P-38J, he downed five German fighters on two separate missions over France and Germany. He subsequently transitioned to P-51s and scored seven more kills. After World War II, he flew F-4 Phantom IIs in Vietnam, ending his career as brigadier general with 16 kills.

===John H. Ross===

Ross is a decorated World War II pilot who flew 96 missions for the U.S. Army Air Forces under the U.S. 8th Air Force&#x27;s 7th Reconnaissance Group in the 22nd Reconnaissance Squadron. Ross flew the Lockheed P-38 Lightning as a photo-reconnaissance pilot out of RAF Mount Farm in England during the war. He received 11 medals and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross twice for missions that were integral to Allied victory at the Battle of the Bulge.

===Antoine de Saint-Exupéry===

At midday on 31 July 1944, noted aviation pioneer and writer Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (&quot;Night Flight&quot;, &quot;Wind, Sand and Stars&quot; and &quot;The Little Prince&quot;) vanished in his P-38 of the French Armée de l&#x27;Air&#x27;s &quot;Groupe de Chasse II/33&quot;, after departing Borgo-Porreta, Corsica. His health, both physically and mentally, had been deteriorating. Saint-Exupéry was said to be intermittently subject to depression and talk had arisen of taking him off flying status. He was on a flight over the Mediterranean, from Corsica to mainland France, in an unarmed F-5B photo-reconnaissance variant of the P-38J, described as being a &quot;war-weary, nonairworthy craft&quot;.

In 2000, a French scuba diver found the partial remnants of a Lightning spread over several thousand square meters of the Mediterranean seabed off the coast of Marseille. In April 2004, the recovered component serial numbers were confirmed as being from Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s F-5B Lightning. Only a small amount of the aircraft&#x27;s wreckage was recovered. In June 2004, the recovered parts and fragments were given to the Air and Space Museum of France in Le Bourget, Paris, where Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s life is commemorated in a special exhibit.

In 1981 and also in 2008, two Luftwaffe fighter pilots, respectively Robert Heichele and Horst Rippert, separately claimed to have shot down Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s P-38. Both claims were unverifiable and possibly self-promotional, as neither of their units&#x27; combat records of action from that period made any note of such a shoot-down.

==Specifications (P-38L)==



==Popular culture==
Harley Earl arranged for several of his designers to view a YP-38 prototype shortly before World War II, and its design directly inspired the tail fins of the 1948–1949 Cadillac.

The P-38 was also the inspiration for Raymond Loewy and his design team at Studebaker for the 1950 and 1951 model-year Studebakers.

The whine of the speeder bike engines in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; was partly achieved by recording the engine noise of a P-38, combined with that of a North American P-51 Mustang.

The popular eight-bit video game &quot;1942&quot; puts the player in command of a P-38 flying over the Pacific, fighting against Japanese Zeros and the Nakajima G10N bomber. The game was made by Japanese company Capcom, intended for Western markets, and finishes with the player raiding Tokyo.

<doc id="25042" wikidata="Q40953" url="?curid=25042" title="Prayer">
<text>Prayer is an invocation or act that seeks to activate a rapport with an object of worship through deliberate communication. In the narrow sense, the term refers to an act of supplication or intercession directed towards a deity or a deified ancestor. More generally, prayer can also have the purpose of thanksgiving or praise, and in comparative religion is closely associated with more abstract forms of meditation and with charms or spells.

Prayer can take a variety of forms: it can be part of a set liturgy or ritual, and it can be performed alone or in groups. Prayer may take the form of a hymn, incantation, formal creedal statement, or a spontaneous utterance in the praying person.

The act of prayer is attested in written sources as early as five thousand years ago. Today, most major religions involve prayer in one way or another; some ritualize the act, requiring a strict sequence of actions or placing a restriction on who is permitted to pray, while others teach that prayer may be practised spontaneously by anyone at any time.

Scientific studies regarding the use of prayer have mostly concentrated on its effect on the healing of sick or injured people. The efficacy of prayer in faith healing has been evaluated in numerous studies, with contradictory results.

==Etymology==
The English term &quot;prayer&quot; is from . The Vulgate Latin is , which translates Greek προσευχή in turn the Septuagint translation of Biblical Hebrew &quot;tĕphillah&quot;.

==Act of prayer==
Various spiritual traditions offer a wide variety of devotional acts. There are morning and evening prayers, graces said over meals, and reverent physical gestures. Some Christians bow their heads and fold their hands. Some Native Americans regard dancing as a form of prayer. Hindus chant mantras. Jewish prayer may involve swaying back and forth and bowing. Muslim prayer involves bowing, kneeling and prostration, while some Sufis whirl. Quakers often keep silent. Some pray according to standardized rituals and liturgies, while others prefer extemporaneous prayers; others combine the two.

=== Typologies and modalities ===

Christian circles often look to Friedrich Heiler (1892-1967), whose systematic &quot;Typology of Prayer&quot; lists six types of prayer: primitive, ritual, Greek cultural, philosophical, mystical, and prophetic. Some forms of prayer require a prior ritualistic form of cleansing or purification, such as in ghusl and wudhu.

Prayer may occur privately and individually (sometimes called affective prayer), or collectively, shared by or led on behalf of fellow-believers of either a specific faith tradition or a broader grouping of people. Prayer can be incorporated into a daily &quot;thought life&quot;, in which one is in constant communication with a god. Some people pray throughout all that is happening during the day and seek guidance as the day progresses. This is actually regarded as a requirement in several Christian denominations, although enforcement is neither possible nor desirable. There can be many different answers to prayer, just as there are many ways to interpret an answer to a question, if there in fact comes an answer. Some may experience audible, physical, or mental epiphanies. If indeed an answer comes, the time and place it comes is considered random.

Some traditions distinguish between contemplative and meditative prayer.

Outward acts that may accompany prayer include anointing with oil; ringing a bell; burning incense or paper; lighting a candle or candles; facing a specific direction (e.g., towards Mecca or the East);
and making the sign of the cross. One less noticeable act related to prayer is fasting.

A variety of body postures may be assumed, often with specific meaning (mainly respect or adoration) associated with them: standing; sitting; kneeling; prostrate on the floor; eyes opened; eyes closed; hands folded or clasped; hands upraised; holding hands with others; a laying on of hands and others. Prayers may be recited from memory, read from a book of prayers, or composed spontaneously or &quot;impromptu&quot;. They may be said, chanted, or sung. They may or may not have a musical accompaniment. There may be a time of outward silence while prayers are offered mentally. Often, there are prayers to fit specific occasions, such as the blessing of a meal, the birth or death of a loved one, other significant events in the life of a believer, or days of the year that have special religious significance. Details corresponding to specific traditions are outlined below.

==Origins and early history==

Anthropologically, the concept of prayer is closely related to that of surrender and supplication.
The traditional posture of prayer in medieval Europe is kneeling or supine with clasped hands, in antiquity more typically with raised hands. The early Christian prayer posture was standing, looking up to heaven, with outspread arms and bare head. This is the pre-Christian, pagan prayer posture (except for the bare head, which was prescribed for males in I Corinthians 11:4, in Roman paganism, the head had to be covered in prayer). Certain Cretan and Cypriote figures of the Late Bronze Age, with arms raised, have been interpreted as worshippers. Their posture is similar to the &quot;flight&quot; posture, a crouching posture with raised hands related to the universal &quot;hands up&quot; gesture of surrender. The kneeling posture with clasped hands appears to have been introduced only with the beginning high medieval period, presumably adopted from a gesture of feudal homage.

Although prayer in its literal sense is not used in animism, communication with the spirit world is vital to the animist way of life. This is usually accomplished through a shaman who, through a trance, gains access to the spirit world and then shows the spirits&#x27; thoughts to the people. Other ways to receive messages from the spirits include using astrology or contemplating fortune tellers and healers.

Some of the oldest extant literature, such as the Kesh temple hymn (c. 26th century BC), is liturgy addressed to deities and thus technically &quot;prayer&quot;. The Egyptian Pyramid Texts of about the same period similarly contain spells or incantations addressed to the gods. In the loosest sense, in the form of magical thinking combined with animism, prayer has been argued as representing a human cultural universal, which would have been present since the emergence of behavioral modernity, by anthropologists such as Sir Edward Burnett Tylor and Sir James George Frazer.

Reliable records are available for the polytheistic religions of the Iron Age, most notably Ancient Greek religion, which strongly influenced Roman religion. These religious traditions were direct developments of the earlier Bronze Age religions.
Ceremonial prayer was highly formulaic and ritualized.

In ancient polytheism, ancestor worship is indistinguishable from theistic worship (see also euhemerism).
Vestiges of ancestor worship persist, to a greater or lesser extent, in modern religious traditions throughout the world, most notably in Japanese Shinto, Vietnamese folk religion, and Chinese folk religion. The practices involved in Shinto prayer are heavily influenced by Buddhism; Japanese Buddhism has also been strongly influenced by Shinto in turn. Shinto prayers quite frequently consist of wishes or favors asked of the &quot;kami&quot;, rather than lengthy praises or devotions. The practice of votive offering is universal and is attested at least since the Bronze Age. In Shinto, this takes the form of a small wooden tablet, called an &quot;ema&quot;.

Prayers in Etruscan were used in the Roman world by augurs and other oracles long after Etruscan became a dead language. The Carmen Arvale and the Carmen Saliare are two specimens of partially preserved prayers that seem to have been unintelligible to their scribes and whose language is full of archaisms and difficult passages.

Roman prayers and sacrifices were envisioned as legal bargains between deity and worshipper. The Roman principle was expressed as &quot;do ut des&quot;: &quot;I give, so that you may give.&quot; Cato the Elder&#x27;s treatise on agriculture contains many examples of preserved traditional prayers; in one, a farmer addresses the unknown deity of a possibly sacred grove, and sacrifices a pig in order to placate the god or goddess of the place and beseech his or her permission to cut down some trees from the grove.
Celtic, Germanic and Slavic religions are recorded much later, and much more fragmentarily, than the religions of classical antiquity. They nevertheless show substantial parallels to the better-attested religions of the Iron Age. In the case of Germanic religion, the practice of prayer is reliably attested, but no actual liturgy is recorded from the early (Roman era) period. An Old Norse prayer is on record in the form of a dramatization in skaldic poetry. This prayer is recorded in stanzas2 and3 of the poem &quot;Sigrdrífumál&quot;, compiled in the 13th century &quot;Poetic Edda&quot; from earlier traditional sources, where the valkyrie Sigrdrífa prays to the gods and the earth after being woken by the hero Sigurd.
A prayer to Odin is mentioned in chapter2 of the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot; where King Rerir prays for a child. In stanza9 of the poem &quot;Oddrúnargrátr&quot;, a prayer is made to &quot;kind wights, Frigg and Freyja, and many gods, In chapter 21 of &quot;Jómsvíkinga saga&quot;, wishing to turn the tide of the Battle of Hjörungavágr, Haakon Sigurdsson eventually finds his prayers answered by the goddesses Þorgerðr Hölgabrúðr and Irpa.
Folk religion in the medieval period produced syncretisms between pre-Christian and Christian traditions. An example is the 11th-century Anglo-Saxon charm &quot;Æcerbot&quot; for the fertility of crops and land, or the medical &quot;Wið færstice&quot;. The 8th-century Wessobrunn Prayer has been proposed as a Christianized pagan prayer and compared to the pagan &quot;Völuspá&quot; and the Merseburg Incantations, the latter recorded in the 9th or 10th century but of much older traditional origins.

In Australian Aboriginal mythology, prayers to the &quot;Great Wit&quot; are performed by the &quot;clever men&quot; and &quot;clever women&quot;, or &quot;kadji&quot;. These Aboriginal shamans use maban or mabain, the material that is believed to give them their powers. The Pueblo Indians are known to have used prayer sticks, that is, sticks with feathers attached as supplicatory offerings. The Hopi Indians used prayer sticks as well, but they attached to it a small bag of sacred meal.

==Approaches to prayer==

===Direct petitions===
There are different forms of prayer. One of them is to directly appeal to a deity to grant one&#x27;s requests. Some have termed this as the social approach to prayer.

Atheist arguments against prayer are mostly directed against petitionary prayer in particular. Daniel Dennett argued that petitionary prayer might have the undesirable psychological effect of relieving a person of the need to take active measures.

This potential drawback manifests in extreme forms in such cases as Christian Scientists who rely on prayers instead of seeking medical treatment for family members for easily curable conditions which later result in death.

Christopher Hitchens (2012) argued that praying to a god which is omnipotent and all-knowing would be presumptuous. For example, he interprets Ambrose Bierce&#x27;s definition of prayer by stating that &quot;the man who prays is the one who thinks that god has arranged matters all wrong, but who also thinks that he can instruct god how to put them right.&quot;

===Educational approach===
In this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. Among Jews, this has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, Rabbi Yehuda Halevi, Joseph Albo, Samson Raphael Hirsch, and Joseph B. Soloveitchik. This view is expressed by Rabbi Nosson Scherman in the overview to the Artscroll Siddur (p. XIII).

Among Christian theologians, E.M. Bounds stated the educational purpose of prayer in every chapter of his book, &quot;The Necessity of Prayer&quot;. Prayer books such as the Book of Common Prayer are both a result of this approach and an exhortation to keep it.

===Rationalist approach===
In this view, the ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation (meditation). This approach was taken by the Jewish scholar and philosopher Maimonides and the other medieval rationalists. It became popular in Jewish, Christian, and Islamic intellectual circles, but never became the most popular understanding of prayer among the laity in any of these faiths. In all three of these faiths today, a significant minority of people still hold to this approach.

In a rationalist approach, praying encompasses three aspects. First, &#x27;logos&#x27;, as the &quot;idea&quot; of the sender, secondly &#x27;rhemata&#x27; as the words to express the idea, and thirdly &#x27;rhemata&#x27; and &#x27;logos&#x27;, to where the idea is sent (e.g. to God, Allah). Thus praying is not a conversation with God, or Jesus but a one-way direction to the divine. Among the Abrahamic religions, Islam, Orthodox Christianity and Hasidic Judaism are likely most adhering to this concept, also because it does not allow secondary mythologies, and has taken its spiritual roots from Hellenistic philosophy, particularly from Aristotle.

Similarly in Hinduism, the different divinities are manifestations of one God with associated prayers. However, many Indians – particularly Hindus – believe that God can be manifest in people, including in people of lower castes, such as Sadhus.

===Experiential approach===

In this approach, the purpose of prayer is to enable the person praying to gain a direct experience of the recipient of the prayer (or as close to direct as a specific theology permits). This approach is very significant in Christianity and widespread in Judaism (although less popular theologically). In Eastern Orthodoxy, this approach is known as hesychasm. It is also widespread in Sufi Islam, and in some forms of mysticism. It has some similarities with the rationalist approach, since it can also involve contemplation, although the contemplation is not generally viewed as being as rational or intellectual.

Christian and Roman Catholic traditions also include an experiential approach to prayer within the practice of &quot;lectio divina&quot;. Historically a Benedictine practice, &quot;lectio divina&quot; involves the following steps: a short scripture passage is read aloud; the passage is meditated upon using the mind to place the listener within a relationship or dialogue with the text; recitation of a prayer; and concludes with contemplation. The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes prayer and meditation as follows: Meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion, and desire. This mobilization of faculties is necessary in order to deepen our convictions of faith, prompt the conversion of our heart, and strengthen our will to follow Christ. Christian prayer tries above all to meditate on the mysteries of Christ, as in lectio divina or the rosary. This form of prayerful reflection is of great value, but Christian prayer should go further: to the knowledge of the love of the Lord Jesus, to union with him.

The experience of God within Christian mysticism has been contrasted with the concept of experiential religion or mystical experience because of a long history or authors living and writing about experience with the divine in a manner that identifies God as unknowable and ineffable, the language of such ideas could be characterized paradoxically as &quot;experiential&quot;, as well as without the phenomena of experience.

The notion of &quot;religious experience&quot; can be traced back to William James, who used a term called &quot;religious experience&quot; in his book, &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;. The origins of the use of this term can be dated further back.

In the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, several historical figures put forth very influential views that religion and its beliefs can be grounded in experience itself. While Kant held that moral experience justified religious beliefs, John Wesley in addition to stressing individual moral exertion thought that the religious experiences in the Methodist movement (paralleling the Romantic Movement) were foundational to religious commitment as a way of life. According to catholic doctrine, Methodists lack a ritualistic and rational approach to praying but rely on individualistic and moralistic forms of worship in direct conversation with God. This approach is rejected by most Orthodox religions.

Wayne Proudfoot traces the roots of the notion of &quot;religious experience&quot; to the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of &quot;religious experience&quot; was used by Schleiermacher and Albert Ritschl to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique, and defend the view that human (moral and religious) experience justifies religious beliefs.

Such religious empiricism would be later seen as highly problematic and was – during the period in-between world wars – famously rejected by Karl Barth. In the 20th century, religious as well as moral experience as justification for religious beliefs still holds sway. Some influential modern scholars holding this liberal theological view are Charles Raven and the Oxford physicist/theologian Charles Coulson.

The notion of &quot;religious experience&quot; was adopted by many scholars of religion, of whom William James was the most influential.

The notion of &quot;experience&quot; has been criticised. Robert Sharf points out that &quot;experience&quot; is a typical Western term, which has found its way into Asian religiosity via western influences. The notion of &quot;experience&quot; introduces a false notion of duality between &quot;experiencer&quot; and &quot;experienced&quot;, whereas the essence of kensho is the realisation of the &quot;non-duality&quot; of observer and observed. &quot;Pure experience&quot; does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity. The specific teachings and practices of a specific tradition may even determine what &quot;experience&quot; someone has, which means that this &quot;experience&quot; is not the &quot;proof&quot; of the teaching, but a &quot;result&quot; of the teaching. A pure consciousness without concepts, reached by &quot;cleaning the doors of perception&quot;, would be an overwhelming chaos of sensory input without coherence.

==Abrahamic religions==

===Hebrew Bible===
In the Hebrew Bible prayer is an evolving means of interacting with God, most frequently through a spontaneous, individual, unorganized form of petitioning and/or thanking. Standardized prayer such as is done today is non-existent, although beginning in Deuteronomy, the Bible lays the groundwork for organized prayer, including basic liturgical guidelines, and by the Bible&#x27;s later books, prayer has evolved to a more standardized form, although still radically different from the form practiced by modern Jews.

Individual prayer is described by the Tanakh two ways. The first of these is when prayer is described as occurring, and a result is achieved, but no further information regarding a person&#x27;s prayer is given. In these instances, such as with Isaac, Moses, Samuel, and Job, the act of praying is a method of changing a situation for the better. The second way in which prayer is depicted is through fully fleshed out episodes of prayer, where a person&#x27;s prayer is related in full. Many famous biblical personalities have such a prayer, including every major character from Hannah to Hezekiah.

===New Testament===

In the New Testament prayer is presented as a positive command. The People of God are challenged to include Christian prayer in their everyday life, even in the busy struggles of marriage as it brings people closer to God.

Jesus encouraged his disciples to pray in secret in their private rooms, using the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, as a humble response to the prayer of the Pharisees, whose practices in prayer were regarded as impious by the New Testament writers.

For evangelists and other Christian sects, prayer is shown to be God&#x27;s appointed method by which we obtain what He has to bestow. Further, the Book of James says that the lack of blessings in life results from a failure to pray. Jesus healed through prayer and expected his followers to do so also. The apostle Paul wrote to the churches of Thessalonica to &quot;Pray continually.&quot;

===Judaism===
Observant Jews pray three times a day, Shacharit, Mincha, and Ma&#x27;ariv with lengthier prayers on special days, such as the Shabbat and Jewish holidays including Musaf and the reading of the Torah. The siddur is the prayerbook used by Jews all over the world, containing a set order of daily prayers. Jewish prayer is usually described as having two aspects: &quot;kavanah&quot; (intention) and &quot;keva&quot; (the ritualistic, structured elements).

The most important Jewish prayers are the Shema Yisrael (&quot;Hear O Israel&quot;) and the Amidah (&quot;the standing prayer&quot;).

Communal prayer is preferred over solitary prayer, and a quorum of ten adult males (a &quot;minyan&quot;) is considered by Orthodox Judaism a prerequisite for several communal prayers.
There are also many other ritualistic prayers a Jew performs during their day, such as washing before eating bread, washing after one wakes up in the morning, and doing grace after meals.

====Rationalist approach====
In this view, the ultimate goal of prayer is to help train a person to focus on divinity through philosophy and intellectual contemplation. This approach was taken by Maimonides and the other medieval rationalists. One example of this approach to prayer is noted by Rabbi Steven Weil, who was appointed the Orthodox Union&#x27;s Executive-Vice President in 2009. He notes that the word &quot;prayer&quot; is a derivative of the Latin &quot;precari&quot;, which means &quot;to beg&quot;. The Hebrew equivalent &quot;tefilah&quot;, however, along with its root &quot;pelel&quot; or its reflexive &quot;l&#x27;hitpallel&quot;, means the act of self-analysis or self-evaluation. This approach is sometimes described as the person praying having a dialogue or conversation with God.

====Educational approach====
In this view, prayer is not a conversation. Rather, it is meant to inculcate certain attitudes in the one who prays, but not to influence. This has been the approach of Rabbenu Bachya, Yehuda Halevy, Joseph Albo, Samson Raphael Hirsch, and Joseph Dov Soloveitchik. This view is expressed by Rabbi Nosson Scherman in the overview to the Artscroll Siddur (p. XIII); note that Scherman goes on to also affirm the Kabbalistic view (see below).

====Kabbalistic approach====
Kabbalah uses a series of &quot;kavanot&quot;, directions of intent, to specify the path the prayer ascends in the dialog with God, to increase its chances of being answered favorably. Kabbalists ascribe a higher meaning to the purpose of prayer, which is no less than affecting the very fabric of reality itself, restructuring and repairing the universe in a real fashion. In this view, every word of every prayer, and indeed, even every letter of every word, has a precise meaning and a precise effect. Prayers thus literally affect the mystical forces of the universe, and repair the fabric of creation.

Among Jews, this approach has been taken by the Chassidei Ashkenaz (German pietists of the Middle-Ages), the Arizal&#x27;s Kabbalist tradition, Ramchal, most of Hassidism, the Vilna Gaon, and Jacob Emden.

===Christianity===

Christian prayers are quite varied. They can be completely spontaneous, or read entirely from a text, like the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. The most common prayer among Christians is the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, which according to the gospel accounts (e.g. ) is how Jesus taught his disciples to pray. The Lord&#x27;s Prayer is a model for prayers of adoration, confession and petition in Christianity.

In the second century &quot;Apostolic Tradition&quot;, Hippolytus instructed Christians to pray at seven fixed prayer times: &quot;on rising, at the lighting of the evening lamp, at bedtime, at midnight&quot; and &quot;the third, sixth and ninth hours of the day, being hours associated with Christ&#x27;s Passion.&quot; Breviaries such as the Shehimo and Agpeya are used by Oriental Orthodox Christians to pray these seven canonical hours while facing in the eastward direction of prayer.

In medieval England, prayers (particularly the &quot;paternoster&quot;) were frequently used as a measure of time in medical and culinary recipe books.

Christians generally pray to God. Some Christians, such as Catholics, Lutherans, Orthodox, and Methodists pray for the dead; Roman Catholics, will also ask the righteous in heaven and &quot;in Christ,&quot; such as the Virgin Mary or other saints to intercede by praying on their behalf (intercession of saints). Formulaic closures in many Christian denominations, such as Lutheranism and Catholicism include &quot;through our Lord Jesus Christ, Your Son, who lives and reigns with You, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, through all the ages of ages,&quot; and &quot;in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.&quot;

It is customary among Christians to end prayers with &quot;In Jesus&#x27; name, Amen&quot; or more commonly, with the sign of the cross while saying the Trinitarian formula. The most commonly used closure of prayer in Christianity is &quot;Amen&quot; (from a Hebrew adverb used as a statement of affirmation or agreement, usually translated as &quot;so be it&quot;).

In the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, probably the most common is the Rosary; in the Eastern Christianity (including the Eastern Catholic Churches of the Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodox Church), the Jesus Prayer. The Jesus Prayer is also often repeated as part of the meditative hesychasm practice in Eastern Christianity.

Latin Catholic tradition includes specific prayers and devotions as acts of reparation which do not involve a petition for a living or deceased beneficiary, but aim to repair the sins of others, e.g. for the repair of the sin of blasphemy performed by others.

====Pentecostalism====
In Pentecostal congregations, prayer is often accompanied by speaking in an unknown tongue, a practice now known as glossolalia. Practitioners of Pentecostal glossolalia may claim that the languages they speak in prayer are real foreign languages, and that the ability to speak those languages spontaneously is a gift of the Holy Spirit. Some people outside of the movement, however, have offered dissenting views. George Barton Cutten suggested that glossolalia was a sign of mental illness. Felicitas Goodman suggested that tongue speakers were under a form of hypnosis. Others suggest that it is a learned behaviour. Some of these views have allegedly been refuted.

====Christian Science====
Christian Science teaches that prayer is a spiritualization of thought or an understanding of God and of the nature of the underlying spiritual creation. Adherents believe that this can result in healing, by bringing spiritual reality into clearer focus in the human scene. The world as it appears to the senses is regarded as a distorted version of the world of spiritual ideas. Prayer can heal the distortion. Christian Scientists believe that prayer does not change the spiritual creation but gives a clearer view of it, and the result appears in the human scene as healing: the human picture adjusts to coincide more nearly with the divine reality. Christian Scientists do not practice intercessory prayer as it is commonly understood, and they generally avoid combining prayer with medical treatment in the belief that the two practices tend to work against each other. Prayer works through love: the recognition of God&#x27;s creation as spiritual, intact, and inherently lovable.

===Islam===
The Arabic word for prayer is &quot;salah&quot;. The daily obligatory prayers collectively form the second of the five pillars in Islam, observed three or five times every day at prescribed times. The command of ritual prayer repeatedly occurs in the Quran. The person performs the prayer while they are facing the Kaaba in Mecca. There is the &quot;call for prayer&quot; (&quot;the adhan&quot;), where the &quot;muezzin&quot; calls for all the followers to stand together for the prayer. The prayer consists of actions such as glorifying and praising God (such as mentioning &#x27;Allāhu Akbar&#x27; (God is Great)) while standing, recitation of chapters of the Quran (such as the opening chapter of the book (&quot;Al-Fatiha&quot;)), bowing down then praising God, prostrating (&quot;sujud&quot;) then again praising God. It ends with the words: &quot;Peace be with you and God&#x27;s mercy.&quot; During the prayer, a Muslim cannot talk or do anything else besides pray. Once the prayer is complete, one can offer personal prayers or supplications to God for their needs, known as &quot;dua&quot;. There are many standard invocations in Arabic to be recited at various times (&quot;e.g.&quot; after the prayer) and for various occasions (&quot;e.g.&quot; for one&#x27;s parents) with manners and etiquette such as before eating. Muslims may also say &quot;dua&quot; in their own words and languages for any issue they wish to communicate with God in the hope that God will answer their prayers. Certain Shi&#x27;a sects pray the five daily prayers divided into three separate parts of the day, providing several Hadith as supporting evidence; although according to Shi&#x27;a Islam, it is also permissible to pray at five times.

===Mandaeism===

Daily prayer in Mandaeism called &quot;brakha&quot; consists of a set prayers that are recited three times per day. Mandaeans stand facing north while reciting daily prayers. Unlike in Islam and Coptic Orthodox Christianity, prostration is not practiced.

Mandaean priests recite rahma prayers three times every day, while laypeople also recite the &quot;Rushuma&quot; (signing prayer) and &quot;Asut Malkia&quot; (&quot;Healing of Kings&quot;) daily.

The three prayer times in Mandaeism are:

*dawn (sunrise)
*noontime (the &quot;seventh hour&quot;)
*evening (sunset)

===Baháʼí Faith===

Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the Báb, and `Abdu&#x27;l-Bahá wrote many prayers for general use, and some for specific occasions, including for unity, detachment, spiritual upliftment, and healing among others. Followers of the Baháʼí Faith are also required to recite each day one of three obligatory prayers composed by Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh. The believers have been enjoined to face in the direction of the Qiblih when reciting their Obligatory Prayer. The longest obligatory prayer may be recited at any time during the day; another, of medium length, is recited once in the morning, once at midday, and once in the evening; and the shortest can be recited anytime between noon and sunset. Baháʼís also read from and meditate on the scriptures every morning and evening.

===Baptism===

Baptists (not to be confused with the Protestant Christian denomination of Baptists) and their prayers play a special role in Christianity, and represent the more theologic and rational approach to Christian praying. John the Baptist was a scholar of the original Hebrew scrolls and was likely exposed to hellenistic philosophy. Baptism is a Hebraic rite of purification that preceded John the Baptist. He is a subject mentioned in the Koran and is thus accepted in Islam and Orthodox religions. Modern Baptists also practice social representation (e.g. work, or altruistic activities) as a form of prayer. In essence, it can be said that Baptists are socialized Christians that themselves accept the Koran and the practice of Muslim prayers. Islam has preserved the tradition of baptizing in the form of ablution and ritual Ghusl for purification purposes.

==Eastern religions==

In both Buddhism and Hinduism, the repetition of mantras is closely related to the practice of repetitive prayer in Western religion (rosary, Jesus prayer) but Buddhists do not pray to a higher deity. Many of the most widespread Hindu and Buddhist mantras are in origin invocations of deities, e.g. Gayatri Mantra dedicated to Savitr, Pavamana Mantra to Soma Pavamana, and many of the Buddhist Dhāraṇī originate as recitations of lists of names or attributes of deities. Most of the shorter Buddhist mantras originate as the invocation of the name of a specific deity or &quot;bodhisattva&quot;, such as &quot;Om mani padme hum&quot; being in origin the invocation of a &quot;bodhisattva&quot; called &quot;Maṇipadma&quot;. However, from an early time these mantras were interpreted in the context of mystical sound symbolism. The most extreme example of this is the om syllable, which as early as in the Aitareya Brahmana was claimed as equivalent to the entire Vedas (collection of ritual hymns).

===Buddhism===

In the earliest Buddhist tradition, the Theravada, and in the later Mahayana tradition of Zen (or Chán), prayer plays only an ancillary role. It is largely a ritual expression of wishes for success in the practice and in helping all beings.

The skillful means (Sanskrit: &quot;upāya&quot;) of the transfer of merit (Sanskrit: &quot;pariṇāmanā&quot;) is an evocation and prayer. Moreover, indeterminate buddhas are available for intercession as they reside in awoken-fields (Sanskrit: &quot;buddha-kshetra&quot;).

The &quot;nirmānakāya&quot; of an awoken-field is what is generally known and understood as a mandala. The opening and closing of the ring (Sanskrit: &quot;maṇḍala&quot;) is an active prayer. An active prayer is a mindful activity, an activity in which mindfulness is not just cultivated but &quot;is&quot;. A common prayer is &quot;May the merit of my practice, adorn Buddhas&#x27; Pure Lands, requite the fourfold kindness from above, and relieve the suffering of the three life-journeys below. Universally wishing sentient beings, Friends, foes, and karmic creditors, all to activate the Bodhi mind, and all to be reborn in the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss.&quot; (願以此功德 莊嚴佛淨土 上報四重恩 下濟三途苦 普願諸眾生 冤親諸債主 悉發菩提心 同生極樂國)

The Generation Stage (Sanskrit: &quot;utpatti-krama&quot;) of Vajrayana involves prayer elements.

The Tibetan Buddhism tradition emphasizes an instructive and devotional relationship to a guru; this may involve devotional practices known as guru yoga which are congruent with prayer. It also appears that Tibetan Buddhism posits the existence of various deities, but the peak view of the tradition is that the deities or &quot;yidam&quot; are no more existent or real than the continuity (Sanskrit: &quot;santana&quot;; refer mindstream) of the practitioner, environment and activity. But how practitioners engage &quot;yidam&quot; or tutelary deities will depend upon the level or more appropriately &quot;yana&quot; at which they are practicing. At one level, one may pray to a deity for protection or assistance, taking a more subordinate role. At another level, one may invoke the deity, on a more equal footing. And at a higher level one may deliberately cultivate the idea that one has become the deity, whilst remaining aware that its ultimate nature is &quot;śūnyatā&quot;. The views of the more esoteric &quot;yana&quot; are impenetrable for those without direct experience and empowerment.

Pure Land Buddhism emphasizes the recitation by devotees of prayer-like mantras, a practice often called &quot;Nembutsu&quot;. On one level it is said that reciting these mantras can ensure rebirth into a &quot;Sambhogakāya&quot; land (Sanskrit: &quot;buddha-kshetra&quot;) after bodily dissolution, a sheer ball spontaneously co-emergent to a Buddha&#x27;s enlightened intention. According to Shinran, the founder of the Pure Land Buddhism tradition that is most prevalent in the US, &quot;for the long haul nothing is as efficacious as the Nembutsu.&quot; On another, the practice is a form of meditation aimed at achieving realization.

But beyond all these practices the Buddha emphasized the primacy of individual practice and experience. He said that supplication to gods or deities was not necessary. Nevertheless, today many lay people in East Asian countries pray to the Buddha in ways that resemble Western prayer—asking for intervention and offering devotion.

===Hinduism===
Hinduism has incorporated many kinds of prayer (Sanskrit: &quot;prārthanā&quot;), from fire-based rituals to philosophical musings. While chanting involves &#x27;by dictum&#x27; recitation of timeless verses or verses with timings and notations, &quot;dhyanam&quot; involves deep meditation (however short or long) on the preferred deity/God. Again the object to which prayers are offered could be a persons referred as &quot;devtas&quot;, trinity or incarnation of either &quot;devtas&quot; or trinity or simply plain formless meditation as practiced by the ancient sages. These prayers can be directed to fulfilling personal needs or liberation, and also for the benefit of others. Ritual invocation was part and parcel of the Vedic religion and as such permeated their sacred texts. Indeed, the highest sacred texts of the Hindus, the Vedas, are a large collection of mantras and prayer rituals. Classical Hinduism came to focus on extolling a single supreme force, Brahman, that is made manifest in several lower forms as the familiar gods of the Hindu pantheon. Hindus in India have numerous devotional movements. Hindus may pray to the highest absolute God Brahman, or more commonly to its three manifestations, a creator god called Brahma, a preserver god called Vishnu and a destroyer god (so that the creation cycle can start afresh) Shiva, and at the next level to Vishnu&#x27;s avatars (earthly appearances) Rama and Krishna or to many other male or female deities. Typically, Hindus pray with their hands (the palms) joined in &quot;pranam&quot;. The hand gesture is similar to the popular Indian greeting &quot;namaste&quot;.

===Sikhism===

The &quot;Ardās&quot; (Punjabi: ਅਰਦਾਸ) is a Sikh prayer that is done before performing or after undertaking any significant task; after reciting the daily &quot;Banis&quot; (prayers); or completion of a service like the &quot;Paath&quot; (scripture reading/recitation), &quot;kirtan&quot; (hymn-singing) program or any other religious program. In Sikhism, these prayers are also said before and after eating. The prayer is a plea to God to support and help the devotee with whatever he or she is about to undertake or has done.

The &quot;Ardas&quot; is usually always done standing up with folded hands. The beginning of the &quot;Ardas&quot; is strictly set by the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh. When it comes to conclusion of this prayer, the devotee uses words like &quot;Waheguru please bless me in the task that I am about to undertake&quot; when starting a new task or &quot;Akal Purakh, having completed the hymn-singing, we ask for your continued blessings so that we can continue with your memory and remember you at all times&quot;, etc. The word &quot;Ardās&quot; is derived from Persian word &#x27;Arazdashat&#x27;, meaning a request, supplication, prayer, petition or an address to a superior authority.

Ardās is a unique prayer based on the fact that it is one of the few well-known prayers in the Sikh religion that was not written in its entirety by the Gurus. The Ardās cannot be found within the pages of the Guru Granth Sahib because it is a continually changing devotional text that has evolved over time in order for it to encompass the feats, accomplishments, and feelings of all generations of Sikhs within its lines. Taking the various derivation of the word Ardās into account, the basic purpose of this prayer is an appeal to Waheguru for his protection and care, as well as being a plea for the welfare and prosperity of all mankind, and a means for the Sikhs to thank Waheguru for all that he has done.

=== Zoroastrianism ===

Zoroastrians believe that the elements are pure and that fire represents God&#x27;s light or wisdom. Zoroastrian worship practices have evolved from ancient times to the present day. Over time, Zoroastrians developed the concept of worshipping in temples, sometimes called fire temples.

==New religious movements==
Wiccan prayers can include meditation, rituals and incantations. Wiccans see prayers as a form of communication with the God and Goddess. Such communication may include prayers for &quot;esbat&quot; and &quot;sabbat&quot; celebrations, for dinner, for pre-dawn times or for one&#x27;s own or others&#x27; safety, for healing or for the dead.

In Raëlism rites and practises vary from initiation ceremonies to sensual meditation. An initiation ceremony usually involves a Raelian putting water on the forehead of a new member. Such ceremonies take place on certain special days on the Raelian calendar. Sensual meditation techniques include breathing exercises and various forms of erotic meditation.

In Eckankar, one of the basic forms of prayer includes singing the word &quot;HU&quot; (pronounced as &quot;hue&quot;), a holy name of God. ECKists may do this with eyes closed or open, aloud or silently. Practitioners may experience the divine ECK or Holy Spirit.

Practitioners of theurgy and Western esotericism may practice a form of ritual which uses both pre-sanctioned prayers and names of God, and prayers &quot;from the heart&quot; that, when combined, allow the participant to ascend spiritually, and in some instances, induce a trance in which God or other spiritual beings may be realized. Very much as in Hermetic Qabalah and orthodox Kabbalah, it is believed that prayer can influence both the physical and non-physical worlds. The use of ritualistic signs and names are believed to be archetypes in which the subconscious may take form as the Inner God, or another spiritual being, and the &quot;prayer from the heart&quot; to be that spiritual force speaking through the participant.
In Thelema (which includes both theist as well as atheist practitioners) adherents share a number of practices that are forms of individual prayer, including basic yoga; (asana and pranayama); various forms of ritual magick; rituals of one&#x27;s own devising (often based upon a syncretism of religions, or Western Esotericism, such as the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram and Star Ruby); and performance of Liber Resh vel Helios (aka Liber 200), which consists of four daily adorations to the sun (often consisting of four hand/body positions and recitation of a memorized song, normally spoken, addressing different godforms identified with the sun).

While no dogma within Thelema expresses the purpose behind any individual aspirant who chooses to perform &quot;Resh&quot;, note that the practice of &quot;Resh&quot; is not a simple petition toward the sun, nor a form of &quot;worshiping&quot; the celestial body that we call the Sun, but instead uses the positioning of that source of light, which enables life on our planet, as well as using mythological images of that solar force, so that the individual can perform the prayer, possibly furthering a self-identification with the sun, so &quot;that repeated application of the Liber Resh adorations expands the consciousness of the individual by compelling him to take a different perspective, by inducing him to &#x27;look at things from the point of view of the Sun&#x27; [...]&quot;.

==Prayer healing==

Prayer is often used as a means of faith healing in an attempt to use religious or spiritual means to prevent illness, cure disease, or improve health.

Scientific studies regarding the use of prayer have mostly concentrated on its effect on the healing of sick or injured people. Meta-studies have been performed showing evidence only for no effect or a potentially small effect. For instance, a 2006 meta analysis on 14 studies concluded that there is &quot;no discernable effect&quot; while a 2007 systemic review of studies on intercessory prayer reported inconclusive results, noting that seven of 17 studies had &quot;small, but significant, effect sizes&quot; but the review noted that the most methodologically rigorous studies failed to produce significant findings. Some studies have indicated increased medical complications in groups receiving prayer over those without.

The efficacy of petition in prayer for physical healing to a deity has been evaluated in numerous other studies, with contradictory results. There has been some criticism of the way the studies were conducted.

Some attempt to heal by prayer, mental practices, spiritual insights, or other techniques, claiming they can summon divine or supernatural intervention on behalf of the ill. Others advocate that ill people may achieve healing through prayer performed by themselves. According to the varied beliefs of those who practice it, faith healing may be said to afford gradual relief from pain or sickness or to bring about a sudden &quot;miracle cure&quot;, and it may be used in place of, or in tandem with, conventional medical techniques for alleviating or curing diseases. Faith healing has been criticized on the grounds that those who use it may delay seeking potentially curative conventional medical care. This is particularly problematic when parents use faith healing techniques on children.

===Efficacy of prayer healing===
In 1872, Francis Galton conducted a famous statistical experiment to determine whether prayer had a physical effect on the external environment. Galton hypothesized that if prayer was effective, members of the British Royal family would live longer, given that thousands prayed for their wellbeing every Sunday. He therefore compared longevity in the British Royal family with that of the general population, and found no difference. While the experiment was probably intended to satirize, and suffered from a number of confounders, it set the precedent for a number of different studies, the results of which are contradictory.

Two studies claimed that patients who are being prayed for recover more quickly or more frequently although critics have claimed that the methodology of such studies are flawed, and the perceived effect disappears when controls are tightened. One such study, with a double-blind design and about 500 subjects per group, was published in 1988; it suggested that intercessory prayer by born again Christians had a statistically significant positive effect on a coronary care unit population. Critics contend that there were severe methodological problems with this study. Another such study was reported by Harris et al. Critics also claim that the 1988 study was not fully double-blinded, and that in the Harris study, patients actually had a longer hospital stay in the prayer group, if one discounts the patients in both groups who left before prayers began, although the Harris study did demonstrate the prayed for patients on average received lower course scores (indicating better recovery).

One of the largest randomized, blind clinical trials was a remote &quot;retroactive&quot; intercessory prayer study conducted in Israel by Leibovici. This study used 3393 patient records from 1990 to 1996, and blindly assigned some of these to an intercessory prayer group. The prayer group had shorter hospital stays and duration of fever.

Several studies of prayer effectiveness have yielded null results. A 2001 double-blind study of the Mayo Clinic found no significant difference in the recovery rates between people who were (unbeknownst to them) assigned to a group that prayed for them and those who were not. Similarly, the MANTRA study conducted by Duke University found no differences in outcome of cardiac procedures as a result of prayer. In another similar study published in the &quot;American Heart Journal&quot; in 2006, Christian intercessory prayer when reading a scripted prayer was found to have no effect on the recovery of heart surgery patients; however, the study found patients who had knowledge of receiving prayer had slightly higher instances of complications than those who did not know if they were being prayed for or those who did not receive prayer. Another 2006 study suggested that prayer actually had a significant negative effect on the recovery of cardiac bypass patients, resulting in more frequent deaths and slower recovery time for those patient who received prayers.

Many believe that prayer can aid in recovery, not due to divine influence but due to psychological and physical benefits. It has also been suggested that if a person knows that he or she is being prayed for it can be uplifting and increase morale, thus aiding recovery. (See Subject-expectancy effect.) Many studies have suggested that prayer can reduce physical stress, regardless of the god or gods a person prays to, and this may be true for many worldly reasons. According to a study by Centra State Hospital, &quot;the psychological benefits of prayer may help reduce stress and anxiety, promote a more positive outlook, and strengthen the will to live.&quot; Other practices such as yoga, tai chi, and meditation may also have a positive impact on physical and psychological health.
Others feel that the concept of conducting prayer experiments reflects a misunderstanding of the purpose of prayer. The previously mentioned study published in the &quot;American Heart Journal&quot; indicated that some of the intercessors who took part in it complained about the scripted nature of the prayers that were imposed to them, saying that this is not the way they usually conduct prayer: 

One scientific movement attempts to track the physical effects of prayer through neuroscience. Leaders in this movement include Andrew Newberg, an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania. In Newberg&#x27;s brain scans, monks, priests, nuns, sisters and gurus alike have exceptionally focused attention and compassion sites. This is a result of the frontal lobe of the brain&#x27;s engagement (Newberg, 2009). Newburg believes that anybody can connect to the supernatural with practice. Those without religious affiliations benefit from the connection to the metaphysical as well. Newberg also states that further evidence towards humans&#x27; need for metaphysical relationships is that as science had increased spirituality has not decreased. Newburg believes that at the end of the 18th century, when the scientific method began to consume the human mind, religion could have vanished. However, two hundred years later, the perception of spirituality, in many instances, appears to be gaining in strength (2009). Newberg&#x27;s research also provides the connection between prayer and meditation and health. By understanding how the brain works during religious experiences and practices Newberg&#x27;s research shows that the brain changes during these practices allowing an understanding of how religion affects psychological and physical health (2009). For example, brain activity during meditation indicates that people who frequently practice prayer or meditation experience lower blood-pressure, lower heart rates, decreased anxiety, and decreased depression.

Another paradigm of research returns to the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (1979-2007) which has provided an explanatory model for mind-matter interactions. Jahn and his colleagues explain the local and nonlocal effects of consciousness by an explanation of the normal pathways, through those intentions life prayer, can change the praying person&#x27;s emotion and behavior, and anomalous pathways which can affect another one through the unconscious-implicit order trajectory via quantum nonlocality mechanism.

===Efficacy of prayer for fertility===
One study faked results in order to imply that prayer combined with IVF treatment nearly doubled the number of women who were successfully pregnant, and more than doubled the number of successful implantations. The fraud was revealed three years after publication.

===Prevalence of prayer for health===
Some modalities of alternative medicine employ prayer. A survey released in May 2004 by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health in the United States, found that in 2002, 43% of Americans pray for their own health, 24% pray for others&#x27; health, and 10% participate in a prayer group for their own health.

<text>Punjabi, sometimes spelled Panjabi, is an Indo-Aryan language native to the Punjab region of Pakistan and India. It is one of the most widely spoken native languages in the world with approximately 150 million native speakers.

Punjabi is the most widely-spoken first language in Pakistan, with 88.9 million native speakers according to the 2023 Pakistani census, and the 11th most widely-spoken in India, with 31.1 million native speakers, according to the 2011 census. It is spoken among a significant overseas diaspora, particularly in Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, and the Gulf states.

In Pakistan, Punjabi is written using the Shahmukhi alphabet, based on the Perso-Arabic script; in India, it is written using the Gurmukhi alphabet, based on the Indic scripts. Punjabi is unusual among the Indo-Aryan languages and the broader Indo-European language family in its usage of lexical tone.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
The word &quot;Punjabi&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;Panjabi&quot;) has been derived from the word &quot;Panj-āb&quot;, Persian for &#x27;Five Waters&#x27;, referring to the five major eastern tributaries of the Indus River. The name of the region was introduced by the Turko-Persian conquerors of South Asia and was a translation of the Sanskrit name, &quot;Panchanada&quot;, which means &#x27;Land of the Five Rivers&#x27;.

&quot;Panj&quot; is cognate with Sanskrit &quot;&quot; (), Greek &quot;pénte&quot; (), and Lithuanian &quot;Penki&quot;, all of which meaning &#x27;five&#x27;; &quot;āb&quot; is cognate with Sanskrit &quot;áp&quot; () and with the of . The historical Punjab region, now divided between India and Pakistan, is defined physiographically by the Indus River and these five tributaries. One of the five, the Beas River, is a tributary of another, the Sutlej.

===Origin===

Punjabi developed from Prakrit languages and later (, &#x27;deviated&#x27; or &#x27;non-grammatical speech&#x27;) From 600 BC, Sanskrit developed as the standard literary and administrative language and Prakrit languages evolved into many regional languages in different parts of India. All these languages are called Prakrit languages (Sanskrit: ) collectively. Paishachi Prakrit was one of these Prakrit languages, which was spoken in north and north-western India and Punjabi developed from this Prakrit. Later in northern India Paishachi Prakrit gave rise to Paishachi Apabhraṃśa, a descendant of Prakrit. Punjabi emerged as an Apabhramsha, a degenerated form of Prakrit, in the 7th century AD and became stable by the 10th century. The earliest writings in Punjabi belong to the Nath Yogi-era from 9th to 14th century. The language of these compositions is morphologically closer to Shauraseni Apbhramsa, though vocabulary and rhythm is surcharged with extreme colloquialism and folklore. Writing in 1317–1318, Amir Khusrau referred to the language spoken by locals around the area of Lahore as &quot;Lahauri&quot;. The precursor stage of Punjabi between the 10th and 16th centuries is termed &#x27;Old Punjabi&#x27;, whilst the stage between the 16th and 19th centuries is termed as &#x27;Medieval Punjabi&#x27;.

===Arabic and Persian influences===

The Arabic and Modern Persian influence in the historical Punjab region began with the late first millennium Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent. Since then, many Persian words have been incorporated into Punjabi (such as &quot;zamīn&quot;, &quot;śahir&quot; etc.) and are used with a liberal approach. Through Persian, Punjabi also absorbed many Arabic-derived words like &quot;dukān&quot;, &quot;ġazal&quot; and more, as well as Turkic words like &quot;qēncī&quot;, &quot;sōġāt&quot;, etc. After the fall of the Sikh empire, Urdu was made the official language of Punjab under the British (in Pakistani Punjab, it is still the primary official language) and influenced the language as well.

In the second millennium, Punjabi was lexically influenced by Portuguese (words like &quot;almārī&quot;), Greek (words like &quot;dām&quot;), Japanese (words like &quot;rikśā&quot;), Chinese (words like &quot;cāh&quot;, &quot;līcī&quot;, &quot;lukāṭh&quot;) and English (words like &quot;jajj&quot;, &quot;apīl&quot;, &quot;māsṭar&quot;), though these influences have been minor in comparison to Persian and Arabic. In fact, the sounds // (ਜ਼ / ), // (ਗ਼ / ), // (ਕ਼ / ), // (ਸ਼ / ), // (ਖ਼ / ) and // (ਫ਼ / ) are all borrowed from Persian, but in some instances the latter three arise natively. Later, the letters ਜ਼ / , ਸ਼ / and ਫ਼ / began being used in English borrowings, with ਸ਼ / also used in Sanskrit borrowings.

Punjabi has also had minor influence from and on neighbouring languages such as Sindhi, Haryanvi, Pashto and Hindustani.


=== Modern times ===

Modern Punjabi emerged in the 19th century from the Medieval Punjabi stage. Modern Punjabi has two main varieties, Western Punjabi and Eastern Punjabi, which have many dialects and forms, altogether spoken by over 150 million people. The Majhi dialect, which is transitional between the two main varieties, has been adopted as standard Punjabi in India and Pakistan for education and mass media. The Majhi dialect originated in the Majha region of the Punjab.

In India, Punjabi is written in the Gurmukhī script in offices, schools, and media. Gurmukhi is the official standard script for Punjabi, though it is often unofficially written in the Latin scripts due to influence from English, one of India&#x27;s two primary official languages at the Union-level.

In Pakistan, Punjabi is generally written using the Shahmukhī script, which in literary standards, is identical to the Urdu alphabet, however various attempts have been made to create certain, distinct characters from a modification of the Persian Nastaʿlīq characters to represent Punjabi phonology, not already found in the Urdu alphabet. In Pakistan, Punjabi loans technical words from Persian and Arabic, just like Urdu does.

== Geographic distribution ==
Punjabi is the most widely spoken language in Pakistan, the eleventh-most widely spoken in India, and also present in the Punjabi diaspora in various countries.

=== Pakistan ===
Punjabi is the most widely spoken language in Pakistan, being the native language of 88.9 million people, or approximately 37% of the country&#x27;s population.

Beginning with the 1981 and 2017 censuses respectively, speakers of the Western Punjabi&#x27;s Saraiki and Hindko varieties were no longer included in the total numbers for Punjabi, which explains the apparent decrease. Pothwari speakers however are included in the total numbers for Punjabi.

=== India ===
Punjabi is the official language of the Indian state of Punjab, and has the status of an additional official language in Haryana and Delhi. Some of its major urban centres in northern India are Amritsar, Ludhiana, Chandigarh, Jalandhar, Ambala, Patiala, Bathinda, Hoshiarpur, Firozpur and Delhi.

In the 2011 census of India, million reported their language as Punjabi. The census publications group this with speakers of related &quot;mother tongues&quot; like Bagri and Bhateali to arrive at the figure of million.

=== Punjabi diaspora ===
Punjabi is also spoken as a minority language in several other countries where Punjabi people have emigrated in large numbers, such as the United States, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Canada.

There were 670,000 native Punjabi speakers in Canada in 2021, 300,000 in the United Kingdom in 2011, 280,000 in the United States and smaller numbers in other countries.

=== Punjabi speakers by country ===
==Major dialects==
===Standard Punjabi===
&quot;Standard Punjabi&quot; (sometimes referred to as Majhi) is the standard form of Punjabi used commonly in education and news broadcasting, and is based on the Majhi dialect. Such as the variety used on Google Translate, Standard Punjabi is also often used in official online services that employ Punjabi. It is widely used in the TV and entertainment industry of Pakistan, which is mainly produced in Lahore.

The Standard Punjabi used in India and Pakistan have slight differences. In India, it discludes many of the dialect-specific features of Majhi. In Pakistan, the standard is closer to the Majhi spoken in the urban parts of Lahore.

===Eastern Punjabi===
&quot;Eastern Punjabi&quot; refers to the varieties of Punjabi spoken in Pakistani Punjab (specifically Northern Punjabi), most of Indian Punjab, the far-north of Rajasthan and on the northwestern border of Haryana. It includes the dialects of Majhi, Malwai, Doabi, Puadhi and the extinct Lubanki.

Sometimes, Dogri and Kangri are grouped into this category.

===Western Punjabi===

&quot;Western Punjabi&quot; or &quot;Lahnda&quot; (, ) is the name given to the diverse group of Punjabi varieties spoken in the majority of Pakistani Punjab, the Hazara region, most of Azad Kashmir and small parts of Indian Punjab such as Fazilka. These include groups of dialects like Saraiki, Pahari-Pothwari, Hindko and the extinct Inku; common dialects like Jhangvi, Shahpuri, Dhanni and Thali which are usually grouped under the term Jatki Punjabi; and the mixed variety of Punjabi and Sindhi called Khetrani.

Depending on context, the terms Eastern and Western Punjabi can simply refer to all the Punjabi varieties spoken in India and Pakistan respectively, whether or not they are linguistically Eastern/Western.

== Phonology ==

While a vowel length distinction between short and long vowels exists, reflected in modern Gurmukhi orthographical conventions, it is secondary to the vowel quality contrast between centralised vowels and peripheral vowels in terms of phonetic significance.
The peripheral vowels have nasal analogues. There is a tendency with speakers to insert /ɪ̯/ between adjacent &quot;a&quot;-vowels as a separator. This usually changes to /ʊ̯/ if either vowel is nasalised.
Note: for the tonal stops, refer to the next section about Tone.

The three retroflex consonants do not occur initially, and the nasals most commonly occur as allophones of in clusters with velars and palatals (there are few exceptions). The well-established phoneme may be realised allophonically as the voiceless retroflex fricative in learned clusters with retroflexes. Due to its foreign origin, it is often also realised as , in e.g. &quot;shalwār&quot; . The phonemic status of the consonants varies with familiarity with Hindustani norms, more so with the Gurmukhi script, with the pairs , , , , and systematically distinguished in educated speech, /q/ being the most rarely pronounced. The retroflex lateral is most commonly analysed as an approximant as opposed to a flap. Some speakers soften the voiceless aspirates /t͡ʃʰ, pʰ, kʰ/ into fricatives /ɕ, f, x/ respectively.

In rare cases, the /ɲ/ and /ŋ/ phonemes in Shahmukhi may be represented with letters from Sindhi. The /ɲ/ phoneme, which is more common than /ŋ/, is written as or depending on its phonetic preservation, e.g. /ɲaːɳaː/ (preserved &quot;ñ&quot;) as opposed to /kiɲd͡ʒ/ (assimilated into &quot;nj&quot;). /ŋ/ is always written as .

=== Diphthongs ===

Like Hindustani, the diphthongs /əɪ/ and /əʊ/ have mostly disappeared, but are still retained in some dialects.

Phonotactically, long vowels /aː, iː, uː/ are treated as doubles of their short vowel counterparts /ə, ɪ, ʊ/ rather than separate phonemes. Hence, diphthongs like &quot;ai&quot; and &quot;au&quot; get monophthongised into /eː/ and /oː/, and &quot;āi&quot; and &quot;āu&quot; into /ɛː/ and /ɔː/ respectively.

The phoneme /j/ is very fluid in Punjabi. /j/ is only truly pronounced word-initially (even then it often becomes /d͡ʒ/), where it is otherwise /ɪ/ or /i/.

=== Tone ===
Unusually for an Indo-Aryan language, Punjabi distinguishes lexical tones. Three tones are distinguished in Punjabi (some sources have described these as tone contours, given in parentheses): low (high-falling), high (low-rising), and level (neutral or middle). The transcriptions and tone annotations in the examples below are based on those provided in Punjabi University, Patiala&#x27;s &quot;Punjabi-English Dictionary&quot;.
Level tone is found in about 75% of words and is described by some as absence of tone. There are also some words which are said to have rising tone in the first syllable and falling in the second. (Some writers describe this as a fourth tone.) However, a recent acoustic study of six Punjabi speakers in the United States found no evidence of a separate falling tone following a medial consonant.
* / , &quot;móḍà&quot; (rising-falling), &quot;shoulder&quot;

It is considered that these tones arose when voiced aspirated consonants () lost their aspiration.

==== Mechanics ====
In Punjabi, tone is induced by the loss of [h] in tonal consonants. Tonal consonants are any voiced aspirates /ʱ/ and the voiced glottal fricative /ɦ/. These include the five voiced aspirated plosives &quot;bh&quot;, &quot;dh&quot;, &quot;ḍh&quot;, &quot;jh&quot; and &quot;gh&quot; (which are represented by their own letters in Gurmukhi), the &quot;h&quot; consonant itself and any voiced consonants appended with [h] (Gurmukhi:੍ਹ &quot;perī̃ hāhā&quot;, Shahmukhi: &quot;dō-caśmī hē&quot;); usually &quot;ṛh&quot;, &quot;mh&quot;, &quot;nh&quot;, &quot;rh&quot; and &quot;lh&quot;.

* Tonal consonants induce a rising tone (also called &quot;high tone&quot;) before them or a falling tone (also called &quot;low tone&quot;) after them.
** E.g. &quot;kaḍḍh&quot; &gt; &quot;káḍḍ&quot; &quot;remove&quot;, &quot;he&quot; &gt; &quot;è&quot; &quot;is&quot;
* In cases where a vowel is present on both sides of a tonal consonant, the stressed vowel receives the tone.
** E.g. &quot;paṛhāī&quot; &gt; &quot;paṛā̀ī&quot; &quot;study&quot;, &quot;mōḍhā&quot; &gt; &quot;mṓḍā&quot; &quot;shoulder&quot;

The five tonal plosives also become voiceless word-initially. E.g. &quot;ghar&quot; &gt; &quot;kàr&quot; &quot;house&quot;, &quot;ḍhōl&quot; &gt; &quot;ṭṑl&quot; &quot;drum&quot; etc.

Tonogenesis in Punjabi forfeits the sound of [h] for tone. Thus, the more [h] is realised, the less &quot;tonal&quot; a word will be pronounced, and vice versa. Tone is often reduced or rarely deleted when words are said with emphasis or on their own as a form of more exact identification.

Sequences with the consonant &quot;h&quot; have some additional gimmicks:
* The sequences &quot;ih&quot;, &quot;uh&quot;, &quot;ahi&quot; and &quot;ahu&quot; change into the vowels /eː˩˥/, /oː˩˥/, /ɛː˩˥/ and /ɔː˩˥/ respectively and acquire a rising tone.
** E.g. &quot;muhrā&quot; &gt; &quot;mṓrā&quot; &quot;chessman&quot;, &quot;rahiṇ&quot; &gt; &quot;réṇ&quot; &quot;stay&quot;
* In the stressed sequence &quot;ah&quot;, the vowel lengthens (&quot;ā&quot;) and acquires a rising tone /aː˩˥/.
** E.g. &quot;qahvā&quot; &gt; &quot;qā́vā&quot; &quot;coffee&quot;, &quot;dah&quot; &gt; &quot;dā́&quot; &quot;ten&quot;
* In the final unstressed sequence &quot;ah&quot;, the vowel becomes nasalised and long (&quot;ā̃&quot;).
** E.g. &quot;bā́rah&quot; &gt; &quot;bā́rā̃&quot; &quot;twelve&quot;, &quot;tárah&quot; &gt; &quot;tárā̃&quot; &quot;way&quot;
* When h is preceded by a short vowel, proceeded by a long vowel and the latter is stressed, the former vowel becomes weak or blends into the latter.
** E.g. &quot;pahāṛ&quot; &gt; &quot;păā̀ṛ&quot; /pə̯aː˥˩.ɽə̆/ &quot;mountain&quot;, &quot;tuhāḍā&quot; &gt; &quot;tŭā̀ḍā&quot; /tʊ̯aː˥˩ɖ.ɖaː/ &quot;your&quot;

The consonant &quot;h&quot; on its own is now silent or very weakly pronounced except word-initially. However, certain dialects which exert stronger tone, particularly more northern Punjabi varieties and Dogri, pronounce &quot;h&quot; as very faint (thus tonal) in all cases. E.g. &quot;hatth&quot; &gt; &quot;àtth&quot;.

The Jhangvi and Shahpuri dialects of Punjabi (as they transition into Saraiki) show comparatively less realisation of tone than other Punjabi varieties, and do not induce the devoicing of the main five tonal consonants (&quot;bh&quot;, &quot;dh&quot;, &quot;ḍh&quot;, &quot;jh&quot;, &quot;gh&quot;).

The Gurmukhi script which was developed in the 16th century has separate letters for voiced aspirated sounds, so it is thought that the change in pronunciation of the consonants and development of tones may have taken place since that time.

Some other languages in Pakistan have also been found to have tonal distinctions, including Burushaski, Gujari, Hindko, Kalami, Shina, and Torwali, though these (besides Hindko) seem to be independent of Punjabi.

=== Gemination ===
Gemination of a consonant (doubling the letter) is indicated with &quot;adhak&quot; in Gurmukhi and &quot;tashdīd&quot; in Shahmukhi. Its inscription with a unique diacritic is a distinct feature of Gurmukhi compared to Brahmic scripts.

All consonants except six (&quot;ṇ&quot;, &quot;ṛ&quot;, &quot;h&quot;, &quot;r&quot;, &quot;v&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) are regularly geminated. The latter four are only geminated in loan words from other languages.

There is a tendency to irregularly geminate consonants which follow long vowels, except in the final syllable of a word, e.g.&quot;menū̃&quot; &gt; &quot;mennū̃&quot;. It also causes the long vowels to shorten but remain peripheral, distinguishing them from the central vowels /ə, ɪ, ʊ/. This gemination is less prominent than the literarily regular gemination represented by the diacritics mentioned above.

Before a non-final prenasalised consonant, long vowels undergo the same change but no gemination occurs.

The true gemination of a consonant after a long vowel is unheard of but is written in some English loanwords to indicate short /ɛ/ and /ɔ/, e.g. ਡੈੱਡ /ɖɛɖː/ &quot;dead&quot;.

== Grammar ==
Punjabi has a canonical word order of SOV (subject–object–verb). Function words are largely postpositions marking grammatical case on a preceding nominal.

Punjabi distinguishes two genders, two numbers, and six cases, direct, oblique, vocative, ablative, locative, and instrumental. The ablative occurs only in the singular, in free variation with oblique case plus ablative postposition, and the locative and instrumental are usually confined to set adverbial expressions.

Adjectives, when declinable, are marked for the gender, number, and case of the nouns they qualify. There is also a T-V distinction.
Upon the inflectional case is built a system of particles known as postpositions, which parallel English&#x27;s prepositions. It is their use with a noun or verb that is what necessitates the noun or verb taking the oblique case, and it is with them that the locus of grammatical function or &quot;case-marking&quot; then lies. 
The Punjabi verbal system is largely structured around a combination of aspect and tense/mood. Like the nominal system, the Punjabi verb takes a single inflectional suffix, and is often followed by successive layers of elements like auxiliary verbs and postpositions to the right of the lexical base.

== Vocabulary ==
Being an Indo-Aryan language, the core vocabulary of Punjabi consists of tadbhav words inherited from Sanskrit. It contains many loanwords from Persian and Arabic.

== Writing systems ==
The Punjabi language is written in multiple scripts (a phenomenon known as synchronic digraphia). Each of the major scripts currently in use is typically associated with a particular religious group, although the association is not absolute or exclusive.
In India, Punjabi Sikhs use Gurmukhi, a script of the Brahmic family, which has official status in the state of Punjab. In Pakistan, Punjabi Muslims use Shahmukhi, a variant of the Perso-Arabic script and closely related to the Urdu alphabet. Sometimes Punjabi is recorded in the Devanagari script in India, albeit rarely. The Punjabi Hindus in India had a preference for Devanagari, another Brahmic script also used for Hindi, and in the first decades since independence raised objections to the uniform adoption of Gurmukhi in the state of Punjab, but most have now switched to Gurmukhi and so the use of Devanagari is rare. Often in literature, Pakistani Punjabi (written in Shahmukhi) is referred as Western-Punjabi (or West-Punjabi) and Indian Punjabi (written in Gurmukhi) is referred as Eastern-Punjabi (or East-Punjabi), although the underlying language is the same with a very slight shift in vocabulary towards Islamic and Sikh words respectively.

The written standard for Shahmukhi also slightly differs from that of Gurmukhi, as it is used for western dialects, whereas Gurumukhi is used to write eastern dialects.

Historically, various local Brahmic scripts including Laṇḍā and its descendants were also in use.

The Punjabi Braille is used by the visually impaired. There is an altered version of IAST often used for Punjabi in which the diphthongs &quot;ai&quot; and &quot;au&quot; are written as &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot;, and the long vowels &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; are written as &quot;ē&quot; and &quot;ō&quot;.

Translation

Lahore is the capital city of Pakistani Punjab. After Karachi, Lahore is the second largest city. Lahore is Pakistan&#x27;s political, cultural, and educational hub, and so it is also said to be the heart of Pakistan. Lahore lies on the bank of the Ravi River. Its population is close to ten million people.

==Literature development==

===Medieval period ===
*Fariduddin Ganjshakar (1179–1266) is generally recognised as the first major poet of the Punjabi language. Roughly from the 12th century to the 19th century, many great Sufi saints and poets preached in the Punjabi language, the most prominent being Bulleh Shah. Punjabi Sufi poetry also developed under Shah Hussain (1538–1599), Sultan Bahu (1630–1691), Shah Sharaf (1640–1724), Ali Haider (1690–1785), Waris Shah (1722–1798), Saleh Muhammad Safoori (1747–1826), Mian Muhammad Baksh (1830–1907) and Khwaja Ghulam Farid (1845–1901).
*The Sikh religion originated in the 15th century in the Punjab region and Punjabi is the predominant language spoken by Sikhs. Most portions of the Guru Granth Sahib use the Punjabi language written in Gurmukhi, though Punjabi is not the only language used in Sikh scriptures.
The &quot;Janamsakhis&quot;, stories on the life and legend of Guru Nanak (1469–1539), are early examples of Punjabi prose literature.

*The Punjabi language is famous for its rich literature of &quot;qisse&quot;, most of which are about love, passion, betrayal, sacrifice, social values and a common man&#x27;s revolt against a larger system. The qissa of Heer Ranjha by Waris Shah (1706–1798) is among the most popular of Punjabi qissas. Other popular stories include &quot;Sohni Mahiwal&quot; by Fazal Shah, &quot;Mirza Sahiban&quot; by Hafiz Barkhudar (1658–1707), &quot;Sassui Punnhun&quot; by Hashim Shah (c. 1735–c. 1843), and &quot;Qissa Puran Bhagat&quot; by Qadaryar (1802–1892).
*Heroic ballads known as &quot;Vaar&quot; enjoy a rich oral tradition in Punjabi. Famous &quot;Vaars&quot; are &quot;Chandi di Var&quot; (1666–1708), &quot;Nadir Shah Di Vaar&quot; by Najabat and the &quot;Jangnama&quot; of Shah Mohammad (1780–1862).

=== Modern period ===

The Victorian novel, Elizabethan drama, free verse and Modernism entered Punjabi literature through the introduction of British education during the Raj. Nanak Singh (1897–1971), Vir Singh, Ishwar Nanda, Amrita Pritam (1919–2005), Puran Singh (1881–1931), Dhani Ram Chatrik (1876–1957), Diwan Singh (1897–1944) and Ustad Daman (1911–1984), Mohan Singh (1905–78) and Shareef Kunjahi are some legendary Punjabi writers of this period.
After independence of Pakistan and India Najm Hossein Syed, Fakhar Zaman and Afzal Ahsan Randhawa, Shafqat Tanvir Mirza, Ahmad Salim, and Najm Hosain Syed, Munir Niazi, Ali Arshad Mir, Pir Hadi Abdul Mannan enriched Punjabi literature in Pakistan, whereas Jaswant Singh Kanwal (1919–2020), Amrita Pritam (1919–2005), Jaswant Singh Rahi (1930–1996), Shiv Kumar Batalvi (1936–1973), Surjit Patar (1944–) and Pash (1950–1988) are some of the more prominent poets and writers from India.

==Status==
Despite Punjabi&#x27;s rich literary history, it was not until 1947 that it would be recognised as an official language. Previous governments in the area of the Punjab had favoured Persian, Hindustani, or even earlier standardized versions of local registers as the language of the court or government. After the annexation of the Sikh Empire by the British East India Company following the Second Anglo-Sikh War in 1849, the British policy of establishing a uniform language for administration was expanded into the Punjab. The British Empire employed Urdu in its administration of North-Central and Northwestern India, while in the North-East of India, Bengali language was used as the language of administration. Despite its lack of official sanction, the Punjabi language continued to flourish as an instrument of cultural production, with rich literary traditions continuing until modern times. The Sikh religion, with its Gurmukhi script, played a special role in standardising and providing education in the language via Gurdwaras, while writers of all religions continued to produce poetry, prose, and literature in the language.

In India, Punjabi is one of the 22 scheduled languages of India. It is the first official language of the Indian State of Punjab. Punjabi also has second language official status in Delhi along with Urdu, and in Haryana.
In Pakistan, no regional ethnic language has been granted official status at the national level, and as such Punjabi is not an official language at the national level, even though it is the most spoken language in Pakistan. It is widely spoken in Punjab, Pakistan, the second largest and the most populous province of Pakistan, as well as in Islamabad Capital Territory. The only two official languages in Pakistan are Urdu and English.

===In Pakistan===

When Pakistan was created in 1947, despite Punjabi being the majority language in West Pakistan and Bengali the majority in East Pakistan and Pakistan as whole, English and Urdu were chosen as the official languages. The selection of Urdu was due to its association with South Asian Muslim nationalism and because the leaders of the new nation wanted a unifying national language instead of promoting one ethnic group&#x27;s language over another, due to this the Punjabi elites started identifying with Urdu more than Punjabi because they saw it as a unifying force on an ethnoreligious perspective. Broadcasting in Punjabi language by Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation decreased on TV and radio after 1947. Article 251 of the Constitution of Pakistan declares that these two languages would be the only official languages at the national level, while provincial governments would be allowed to make provisions for the use of other languages. However, in the 1950s the constitution was amended to include the Bengali language.

Punjabi is not a language of instruction for primary or secondary school students in Punjab Province (unlike Sindhi and Pashto in other provinces). Pupils in secondary schools can choose the language as an elective, while Punjabi instruction or study remains rare in higher education. One notable example is the teaching of Punjabi language and literature by the University of the Punjab in Lahore which began in 1970 with the establishment of its Punjabi Department.

In the cultural sphere, there are many books, plays, and songs being written or produced in the Punjabi-language in Pakistan. Until the 1970s, there were a large number of Punjabi-language films being produced by the Lollywood film industry, however since then Urdu has become a much more dominant language in film production. Additionally, television channels in Punjab Province (centred on the Lahore area) are broadcast in Urdu. The preeminence of Urdu in both broadcasting and the Lollywood film industry is seen by critics as being detrimental to the health of the language.

The use of Urdu and English as the near-exclusive languages of broadcasting, the public sector, and formal education have led some to fear that Punjabi in Pakistan is being relegated to a low-status language and that it is being denied an environment where it can flourish. Several prominent educational leaders, researchers, and social commentators have echoed the opinion that the intentional promotion of Urdu and the continued denial of any official sanction or recognition of the Punjabi language amounts to a process of &quot;Urdu-isation&quot; that is detrimental to the health of the Punjabi language In August 2015, the Pakistan Academy of Letters, International Writer&#x27;s Council (IWC) and World Punjabi Congress (WPC) organised the &quot;Khawaja Farid Conference&quot; and demanded that a Punjabi-language university should be established in Lahore and that Punjabi language should be declared as the medium of instruction at the primary level. In September 2015, a case was filed in Supreme Court of Pakistan against Government of Punjab, Pakistan as it did not take any step to implement the Punjabi language in the province. Additionally, several thousand Punjabis gather in Lahore every year on International Mother Language Day. Thinktanks, political organisations, cultural projects, and individuals also demand authorities at the national and provincial level to promote the use of the language in the public and official spheres.

===In India===
At the federal level, Punjabi has official status via the Eighth Schedule to the Indian Constitution, earned after the Punjabi Suba movement of the 1950s. At the state level, Punjabi is the sole official language of the state of Punjab, while it has secondary official status in the states of Haryana and Delhi. In 2012, it was also made additional official language of West Bengal in areas where the population exceeds 10% of a particular block, sub-division or district.

Both union and state laws specify the use of Punjabi in the field of education. The state of Punjab uses the Three Language Formula, and Punjabi is required to be either the medium of instruction, or one of the three languages learnt in all schools in Punjab. Punjabi is also a compulsory language in Haryana, and other states with a significant Punjabi speaking minority are required to offer Punjabi medium education.

There are vibrant Punjabi language movie and news industries in India, however Punjabi serials have had a much smaller presence within the last few decades in television up to 2015 due to market forces. Despite Punjabi having far greater official recognition in India, where the Punjabi language is officially admitted in all necessary social functions, while in Pakistan it is used only in a few radio and TV programs, attitudes of the English-educated elite towards the language are ambivalent as they are in neighbouring Pakistan. There are also claims of state apathy towards the language in non-Punjabi majority areas like Haryana and Delhi.

==Advocacy==
*Punjabi University was established on 30 April 1962, and is only the second university in the world to be named after a language, after Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The Research Centre for Punjabi Language Technology, Punjabi University, Patiala is working for development of core technologies for Punjabi, Digitisation of basic materials, online Punjabi teaching, developing software for office use in Punjabi, providing common platform to Punjabi cyber community. Punjabipedia, an online encyclopaedia was also launched by Patiala university in 2014.
*The Dhahan Prize was created to award literary works produced in Punjabi around the world. The Prize encourages new writing by awarding $25,000 CDN annually to one &quot;best book of fiction&quot; published in either of the two Punjabi scripts, Gurmukhi or Shahmukhi. Two second prizes of $5,000 CDN are also awarded, with the provision that both scripts are represented among the three winners. The Dhahan Prize is awarded by Canada India Education Society (CIES).

===Governmental academies and institutes===
The Punjabi Sahit academy, Ludhiana, established in 1954 is supported by the Punjab state government and works exclusively for promotion of the Punjabi language, as does the Punjabi academy in Delhi. The Jammu and Kashmir academy of art, culture and literature in Jammu and Kashmir UT, India works for Punjabi and other regional languages like Urdu, Dogri, Gojri etc. Institutions in neighbouring states as well as in Lahore, Pakistan also advocate for the language.

===Software===
*Software is available for the Punjabi language on almost all platforms. This software is mainly in the Gurmukhi script. Nowadays, nearly all Punjabi newspapers, magazines, journals, and periodicals are composed on computers via various Punjabi software programmes, the most widespread of which is InPage Desktop Publishing package. Microsoft has included Punjabi language support in all the new versions of Windows and both Windows Vista, Microsoft Office 2007, 2010 and 2013, are available in Punjabi through the Language Interface Pack support. Most Linux Desktop distributions allow the easy installation of Punjabi support and translations as well. Apple implemented the Punjabi language keyboard across Mobile devices. Google also provides many applications in Punjabi, like Google Search, Google Translate and Google Punjabi Input Tools.

<doc id="25054" wikidata="Q1822837" url="?curid=25054" title="Power associativity">
<text>In mathematics, specifically in abstract algebra, power associativity is a property of a binary operation that is a weak form of associativity.

== Definition ==
An algebra (or more generally a magma) is said to be power-associative if the subalgebra generated by any element is associative. Concretely, this means that if an element formula_1 is performed an operation formula_2 by itself several times, it doesn&#x27;t matter in which order the operations are carried out, so for instance formula_3.

== Examples and properties ==
Every associative algebra is power-associative, but so are all other alternative algebras (like the octonions, which are non-associative) and even non-alternative flexible algebras like the sedenions, trigintaduonions, and Okubo algebras. Any algebra whose elements are idempotent is also power-associative.

Exponentiation to the power of any positive integer can be defined consistently whenever multiplication is power-associative. For example, there is no need to distinguish whether &quot;x&quot;3 should be defined as (&quot;xx&quot;)&quot;x&quot; or as &quot;x&quot;(&quot;xx&quot;), since these are equal. Exponentiation to the power of zero can also be defined if the operation has an identity element, so the existence of identity elements is useful in power-associative contexts.

Over a field of characteristic 0, an algebra is power-associative if and only if it satisfies formula_4 and formula_5, where formula_6 is the associator (Albert 1948).

Over an infinite field of prime characteristic formula_7 there is no finite set of identities that characterizes power-associativity, but there are infinite independent sets, as described by Gainov (1970):

* For formula_8: formula_9 and formula_10 for formula_11 (formula_12
* For formula_13: formula_10 for formula_15 (formula_16
* For formula_17: formula_10 for formula_19 (formula_16
* For formula_21: formula_10 for formula_23 (formula_16

A substitution law holds for real power-associative algebras with unit, which basically asserts that multiplication of polynomials works as expected. For &quot;f&quot; a real polynomial in &quot;x&quot;, and for any &quot;a&quot; in such an algebra define &quot;f&quot;(&quot;a&quot;) to be the element of the algebra resulting from the obvious substitution of &quot;a&quot; into &quot;f&quot;. Then for any two such polynomials &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, we have that .

<text>Charles Pierre de Frédy, Baron de Coubertin (; born Pierre de Frédy; 1 January 1863 – 2 September 1937), also known as Pierre de Coubertin and Baron de Coubertin, was a French educator and historian, co-founder of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and its second president. He is known as the father of the modern Olympic Games. He was particularly active in promoting the introduction of sport in French schools.

Born into a French aristocratic family, Coubertin became an academic and studied a broad range of topics, most notably education and history. He graduated with a degree in law and public affairs from the Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po). It was at the Paris Institute of Political Studies that he came up with the idea of reviving the Olympic Games.

The Pierre de Coubertin World Trophy and the Pierre de Coubertin Medal are named in his honour.

== Early life ==

Pierre de Frédy was born in Paris on 1 January 1863, into an aristocratic family. He was the fourth child of Baron Charles Louis de Frédy, Baron de Coubertin and Marie–Marcelle Gigault de Crisenoy. Family tradition held that the Frédy name had first arrived in France in the early 15th century, and the first recorded title of nobility granted to the family was given by Louis XI to an ancestor, also named Pierre de Frédy, in 1477 but other branches of his family tree delved even further into French history, and the annals of both sides of his family included nobles of various stations, military leaders and associates of kings and princes of France.
His father Charles was a staunch royalist and accomplished artist whose paintings were displayed and given prizes at the Parisian salon, at least in those years when he was not absent in protest of the rise to power of Louis Napoleon. His paintings often centered on themes related to the Catholic Church, classicism, and nobility, which reflected those things he thought most important. In a later semi-fictional autobiographical piece called &quot;Le Roman d&#x27;un rallié&quot;, Coubertin describes his relationship with both his mother and his father as having been somewhat strained during his childhood and adolescence. His memoirs elaborated further, describing as a pivotal moment his disappointment upon meeting Henri, Count of Chambord, whom the elder Coubertin believed to be the rightful king.

Coubertin grew up in a time of profound change in France: defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the Paris Commune, and the establishment of the Third Republic but while these events were the setting of his childhood, his school experiences were just as formative. In October 1874, his parents enrolled him in a new Jesuit school called &quot;Externat de la rue de Vienne&quot;, which was still under construction for his first five years there. While many of the school&#x27;s attendees were day students, Coubertin boarded at the school under the supervision of a Jesuit priest, which his parents hoped would instill him with a strong moral and religious education. There, he was among the top three students in his class, and was an officer of the school&#x27;s elite academy made up of its best and brightest. This suggests that despite his rebelliousness at home, Coubertin adapted well to the strict rigors of a Jesuit education. As was common in the French educational system at the time, Coubertin studied ancient Greece and Rome, which led to an appreciation of the Olympics at an early age.

As an aristocrat, Coubertin had a number of career paths from which to choose, including potentially prominent roles in the military or politics but he chose instead to pursue a career as an intellectual, studying and later writing on a broad range of topics, including education, history, literature and sociology.

== Educational philosophy ==
The subject which he seems to have been most deeply interested in was education, and his study focused in particular on physical education and the role of sport in schooling. In 1883, at the age of twenty, he visited England for the first time, and studied the program of physical education instituted under Thomas Arnold at the Rugby School. Coubertin admired Thomas Hughes&#x27;s novel &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days (published in 1857)&quot;, which was set at the Rugby School. He referenced both the Rugby School and the novel as helping him to appreciate the role of athletics in education, saying that students who learn about fair play and morality on the sports field will be able to apply those lessons in various aspects of their adult life. He credited Arnold&#x27;s methods with leading to the expansion of British power during the 19th century and advocated their use in French institutions. The inclusion of physical education in the curriculum of French schools would become an ongoing pursuit and passion of Coubertin&#x27;s.

Coubertin viewed Thomas Arnold as &quot;one of the founders of athletic chivalry.&quot; However, the character-reforming influence of sport with which Coubertin was so impressed is more likely to have originated in the novel about Arnold&#x27;s school rather than exclusively in the ideas of Arnold himself. Nonetheless, Coubertin was an enthusiast in need of a cause and he found it in England and in Thomas Arnold. &quot;Thomas Arnold, the leader and classic model of English educators,&quot; wrote Coubertin, &quot;gave the precise formula for the role of athletics in education. The cause was quickly won. Playing fields sprang up all over England&quot;. He visited other English schools to see for himself. He described the results in a book, &quot;L&#x27;Education en Angleterre&quot;, which was published in Paris in 1888. The hero of his book is Thomas Arnold, and on his second visit in 1886, Coubertin reflected on Arnold&#x27;s influence in the chapel at Rugby School.

What Coubertin saw on the playing fields of the English schools he visited was how &quot;organised sport can create moral and social strength&quot;. Not only did organized games help to set the mind and body in equilibrium, it also prevented the time being wasted in other ways. First developed by the ancient Greeks, it was an approach to education that he felt the rest of the world had forgotten and to whose revival he was to dedicate the rest of his life.

As a historian and a thinker on education, Coubertin romanticized ancient Greece. Thus, when he began to develop his theory of physical education, he naturally looked to the example set by the Athenian idea of the gymnasium, a training facility that simultaneously encouraged physical and intellectual development. He saw in these gymnasia what he called a triple unity between old and young, between disciplines, and between different types of people, meaning between those whose work was theoretical and those whose work was practical. Coubertin advocated for these concepts, this triple unity, to be incorporated into schools.

While Coubertin was certainly a romantic, and while his idealized vision of ancient Greece would lead him later to the idea of reviving the Olympic Games, his advocacy for physical education was also based on practical concerns. He believed that men who received physical education would be better prepared to fight in wars, and better able to win conflicts like the Franco-Prussian War, in which France had been humiliated. He also saw sport as democratic, in that sports competition crossed class lines, although it did so without causing a mingling of classes, which he did not support.

Unfortunately for Coubertin, his efforts to incorporate more physical education into French schools failed. The failure of this endeavor, however, was closely followed by the development of a new idea, the revival of the ancient Olympic Games as a festival of international athleticism.

He was the referee of the first-ever French championship rugby union final on 20 March 1892, between Racing Club de France and Stade Français.

== Reviving the Olympic Games ==

Thomas Arnold, the head master of Rugby School, was an important influence on Coubertin&#x27;s thoughts about education, but his meetings with William Penny Brookes also influenced his thinking about athletic competition to some extent. A trained physician, Brookes believed that the best way to prevent illness was through physical exercise. In 1850, he had initiated a local athletic competition that he referred to as &quot;Meetings of the Olympian Class&quot; at the Gaskell recreation ground at Much Wenlock, Shropshire. Along with the Liverpool Athletic Club, who began holding their own Olympic Festival in the 1860s, Brookes created a National Olympian Association which aimed to encourage such local competition in cities across Britain. These efforts were largely ignored by the British sporting establishment. Brookes also maintained communication with the government and sporting advocates in Greece, seeking a revival of the Olympic Games internationally under the auspices of the Greek government. There, the philanthropist cousins Evangelos and Konstantinos Zappas had used their wealth to fund Olympics within Greece, and paid for the restoration of the Panathinaiko Stadium that was later used during the 1896 Summer Olympics. The efforts of Brookes to encourage the internationalization of these games came to naught in his own lifetime before his death in 1895. However, Brookes did organize a national Olympic Games in London, at Crystal Palace, in 1866 and this was the first Olympics to resemble an Olympic Games to be held outside of Greece but while others had created Olympic contests within their countries, and broached the idea of international competition, it was Coubertin whose work would lead to the establishment of the International Olympic Committee and the organization of the first modern Olympic Games.

In 1888, Coubertin founded the &quot;Comité pour la Propagation des Exercises Physiques&quot; more well known as the &quot;Comité Jules Simon&quot;. Coubertin&#x27;s earliest reference to the modern notion of Olympic Games criticizes the idea. The idea for reviving the Olympic Games as an international competition came to Coubertin in 1889, apparently independently of Brookes, and he spent the following five years organizing an international meeting of athletes and sports enthusiasts that might make it happen. In response to a newspaper appeal, Brookes wrote to Coubertin in 1890, and the two began an exchange of letters on education and sport. Although he was too old to attend the 1894 Congress, Brookes would continue to support Coubertin&#x27;s efforts, most importantly by using his connections with the Greek government to seek its support in the endeavour. While Brookes&#x27; contribution to the revival of the Olympic Games was recognized in Britain at the time, Coubertin in his later writings largely neglected to mention the role the Englishman played in their development. He did mention the roles of Evangelis Zappas and his cousin Konstantinos Zappas, but drew a distinction between their founding of athletic Olympics and his own role in the creation of an international contest. However, Coubertin together with A. Mercatis, a close friend of Konstantinos, encouraged the Greek government to utilise part of Konstantinos&#x27; legacy to fund the 1896 Athens Olympic Games separately and in addition to the legacy of Evangelis Zappas that Konstantinos had been executor of. Moreover, George Averoff was invited by the Greek government to fund the second refurbishment of the Panathinaiko Stadium that had already been fully funded by Evangelis Zappas forty years earlier.

Coubertin&#x27;s advocacy for the games centered on a number of ideals about sport. He believed that the early ancient Olympics encouraged competition among amateur rather than professional athletes, and saw value in that. The ancient practice of a sacred truce in association with the Games might have modern implications, giving the Olympics a role in promoting peace. This role was reinforced in Coubertin&#x27;s mind by the tendency of athletic competition to promote understanding across cultures, thereby lessening the dangers of war. In addition, he saw the games as important in advocating his philosophical ideal for athletic competition: that the competition itself, the struggle to overcome one&#x27;s opponent, was more important than winning. Coubertin expressed this ideal thus:
&quot;L&#x27;important dans la vie ce n&#x27;est point le triomphe, mais le combat, l&#x27;essentiel ce n&#x27;est pas d&#x27;avoir vaincu mais de s&#x27;être bien battu.&quot;

&quot;The important thing in life is not the triumph but the struggle, the essential thing is not to have conquered but to have fought well.&quot;
As Coubertin prepared for his Congress, he continued to develop a philosophy of the Olympic Games. While he certainly intended the Games to be a forum for competition between amateur athletes, his conception of amateurism was complex. By 1894, the year the Congress was held, he publicly criticized the type of amateur competition embodied in English rowing contests, arguing that its specific exclusion of working-class athletes was wrong. While he believed that athletes should not be paid to be such, he did think that compensation was in order for the time when athletes were competing and would otherwise have been earning money. Following the establishment of a definition for an amateur athlete at the 1894 Congress, he would continue to argue that this definition should be amended as necessary, and as late as 1909 would argue that the Olympic movement should develop its definition of amateurism gradually.

Along with the development of an Olympic philosophy, Coubertin invested time in the creation and development of a national association to coordinate athletics in France, the (USFSA). In 1889, French athletics associations had grouped together for the first time and Coubertin founded a monthly magazine &quot;La Revue Athletique&quot;, the first French periodical devoted exclusively to athletics and modelled on &quot;The Athlete&quot;, an English journal established around 1862. Formed by seven sporting societies with approximately 800 members, by 1892 the association had expanded to 62 societies with 7,000 members.

That November, at the annual meeting of the USFSA, Coubertin first publicly suggested the idea of reviving the Olympics. His speech met general applause, but little commitment to the Olympic ideal he was advocating for, perhaps because sporting associations and their members tended to focus on their area of expertise and had little identity as sportspeople in a general sense.

This disappointing result was the prelude to several challenges he would face in organizing his international conference. To develop support for the conference, he began to play down its role in reviving Olympic Games and instead promoted it as a conference on amateurism in sport which, he thought, was slowly being eroded by betting and sponsorships. This led to later suggestions that participants were convinced to attend under false pretenses. Little interest was expressed by those he spoke to during trips to the United States in 1893 and London in 1894, and an attempt to involve the Germans angered French gymnasts who did not want the Germans invited at all. Despite these challenges, the USFSA continued its planning for the games, adopting in its first program for the meeting eight articles to address, only one of which had to do with the Olympics. A later program would give the Olympics a much more prominent role in the meeting.

The congress was held on 23 June 1894 at the Sorbonne in Paris. Once there, participants divided the congress into two commissions, one on amateurism and the other on reviving the Olympics. A Greek participant, Demetrios Vikelas, was appointed to head the commission on the Olympics, and would later become the first President of the International Olympic Committee. Along with Coubertin, C. Herbert of Britain&#x27;s Amateur Athletic Association and W.M. Sloane of the United States helped lead the efforts of the commission. In its report, the commission proposed that the Olympic Games be held every four years and that the program for the Games be one of modern rather than ancient sports. They also set the date and location for the first modern Olympic Games, the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, and the second, the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris. Coubertin had originally opposed the choice of Greece, as he had concerns about the ability of a weakened Greek state to host the competition, but was convinced by Vikelas to support the idea. The commission&#x27;s proposals were accepted unanimously by the congress, and the modern Olympic movement was officially born.

The proposals of the other commission, on amateurism, were more contentious, but this commission also set important precedents for the Olympic Games, specifically the use of heats to narrow participants and the banning of prize money in most contests.

Following the Congress, the institutions created there began to be formalized into the International Olympic Committee (IOC), with Demetrios Vikelas as its first president. The work of the IOC increasingly focused on the planning of the 1896 Athens Games, and de Coubertin played a background role as Greek authorities took the lead in logistical organization of the Games in Greece itself, offering technical advice such as a sketch of a design of a velodrome to be used in cycling competitions. He also took the lead in planning the program of events, although to his disappointment, polo, football, and boxing were not included in 1896.

The Greek organizing committee had been informed that four foreign football teams had entered, however none of them showed up in Athens, and despite Greek preparations for a football tournament it was cancelled during the Games.

The Greek authorities were also frustrated that he could not provide an exact estimate of the number of attendees more than a year in advance. In France, Coubertin&#x27;s efforts to elicit interest in the Games among athletes and the press met difficulty, largely because the participation of German athletes angered French nationalists who begrudged Germany their victory in the Franco-Prussian War. Germany also threatened not to participate after rumors spread that Coubertin had sworn to keep Germany out, but following a letter to the Kaiser denying the accusation, the German National Olympic Committee decided to attend.

Coubertin himself was frustrated by the Greeks, who increasingly ignored him in their planning and who wanted to continue to hold the Games in Athens every four years, against de Coubertin&#x27;s wishes. The conflict was resolved after he suggested to the King of Greece that he hold pan-Hellenic games in between Olympiads, an idea which the King accepted, although Coubertin would receive some angry correspondence even after the compromise was reached and the King did not mention him at all during the banquet held in honor of foreign athletes during the 1896 Games.

Coubertin took over the IOC presidency when Demetrios Vikelas stepped down after the Olympics in his own country. Despite the initial success, the Olympic movement faced hard times, as the 1900 Games (in De Coubertin&#x27;s own Paris) and 1904 Games were both overshadowed by World&#x27;s Fairs in the same cities, and received little attention.

Further to this, the Paris Games were organized by the organizing committee of the Exposition Universelle, who disagreed with de Coubertin&#x27;s ideas and subsequently fired him, nor were they called Olympics at that time, while the St. Louis Games were predominantly American.

De Coubertin believed strongly that both art and sport should be featured at the Olympics, and in 1904, he wrote the following in the French newspaper &quot;Le Figaro&quot;: &quot;The time has come to take the next step, and to restore the Olympiad to its original beauty. In the high times of Olympia, the fine arts were combined harmoniously with the Olympic Games to create their glory. This is to become reality once again.&quot;

=== President of the International Olympic Committee ===
Coubertin became the second president of the IOC in 1896 with the Paris Olympics of 1900 being the first Games he oversaw as president. He made a major advancement for Olympic recognition by bringing hosting the 1906 Summer Olympics in Athens, which generated increased attention and participation at the Games. Since that time, the Olympic Games have come to be regarded as the world&#x27;s foremost sports competition. Coubertin created the modern pentathlon for the 1912 Olympics, and subsequently stepped down from his IOC presidency after the 1924 Olympics in Paris, which proved much more successful than the first attempt in that city in 1900. He was succeeded as president, in 1925, by Belgian Henri de Baillet-Latour. During his tenure as president, Coubertin finally succeeded in having art competitions included as part of the Olympic Games, something he had advocated for since the founding of the IOC. Much of the funding for the IOC came from Coubertin personally. In fact, he depleted his wealth so much through these donations that he struggled financially at the end of his life.

Years later Coubertin came out of retirement to lend his prestige to assisting Berlin to land the 1936 games. In exchange, Germany nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize. The 1935 winner, however, was the anti-Nazi Carl von Ossietzky.

=== Personal Olympic success ===
Coubertin won the gold medal for literature at the 1912 Summer Olympics for his poem &quot;Ode to Sport,&quot; which was the first time the arts competitions were included at the Games. Coubertin entered the poem under the pseudonym of Georges Hohrod and M. Eschbach which were the names of villages close to his wife&#x27;s place of birth. Below is an excerpt: &quot;O Sport, delight of the Gods, distillation of life! In the grey dingle of modern existence, restless with barren toil, you suddenly appeared like the shining messenger of vanished ages, those ages when humanity could smile.&quot;

== Les Débrouillards ==
Following Francisco Amoros&#x27; ideas, De Coubertin developed a new type of utilitarian sport: &quot;les débrouillards&quot; (the &quot;resourceful men&quot;) from 1900.

The first débrouillards season was organized in 1905/1906, and the program was wide: running, jumping, throwing, climbing, swimming, sword fighting, boxing, shooting, walking, horse riding, rowing, and cycling. (source: FFEPGV archives)

== Scouting ==
In 1911, Pierre de Coubertin founded the interreligious scouting organization aka &quot;Éclaireurs Français&quot; (EF) in France, which later merged to form the Éclaireuses et Éclaireurs de France.

== Personal life ==

In 1895, Pierre de Coubertin married Marie Rothan, the daughter of family friends. Their son Jacques (1896–1952) became sick after being in the sun too long when he was a little child. Their daughter Renée (1902–1968) suffered emotional disturbances and never married. Marie and Pierre tried to console themselves with two nephews, but they were killed at the front in World War I. Coubertin died of a heart attack in Geneva, Switzerland, on 2 September 1937 and was buried in Bois-de-Vaux Cemetery in Lausanne. Marie died in 1963.

At the around the 2022 Winter Olympics, French IOC member and Olympic gold medalist Guy Drut, informed the IOC of his proposal to have de Coubertin&#x27;s remains reinterred at the Panthéon in time for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Drut stated that he had support from de Coubertin&#x27;s family as well as French Academy member Érik Orsenna and had written to French President Emmanuel Macron. In response, IOC President Thomas Bach commented that he thought it was a &quot;wonderful proposal&quot; and &quot;deserves to be successful&quot;, however, he doubted &quot;the IOC could make any steps on this initiative which we appreciate considerably&quot;, yet wished him on behalf of the IOC &quot;the best of success in getting this initiative to fruition.&quot; Drut announced that he had written to Macron &quot;to propose the creation of a study commission for this project.&quot;

After his death, and according to his wish, his heart was taken to Olympia to rest in the memorial stele erected in his honor by the Greek government in 1937.

The stele is located in the Coubertin Grove of the International Olympic Academy. When the Olympic flame is lit in Olympia, the first torchbearer brings it to light the marble altar in the Coubertin Grove. The flame then goes onto Athens, and subsequently the host city.

=== Later life ===
Pierre de Coubertin was the last person to possess his family name. In the words of his biographer John MacAloon, &quot;The last of his lineage, Pierre de Coubertin was the only member of it whose fame would outlive him.&quot;

== Criticism ==

A number of scholars have criticized Coubertin&#x27;s legacy. David C. Young believes that Coubertin&#x27;s assertion that ancient Olympic athletes were amateurs was incorrect. The issue is the subject of scholarly debate. Young and others argue that the athletes of the ancient Games were professional, while opponents led by Pleket argue that the earliest Olympic athletes were in fact amateur, and that the Games only became professionalized after about 480 BC. Coubertin agreed with this latter view, and saw this professionalization as undercutting the morality of the competition.

Further, Young asserts that the effort to limit international competition to amateur athletes, which Coubertin was a part of, was in fact part of efforts to give the upper classes greater control over athletic competition, removing such control from the working classes. Coubertin may have played a role in such a movement, but his defenders argue that he did so unconscious of any class repercussions.

However, it is clear that Coubertin&#x27;s romanticized vision of the ancient Olympic Games was fundamentally different from that described in the historical record. For example, his idea that participation is more important than winning (&quot;L&#x27;important c&#x27;est de participer&quot;) is at odds with the ideals of the Greeks.

Coubertin&#x27;s assertion that the games were the impetus for peace was also an exaggeration; the peace which he spoke of only existed to allow athletes to travel safely to Olympia, and neither prevented the outbreak of wars nor ended ongoing ones.

Scholars have critiqued the idea that athletic competition might lead to greater understanding between cultures and, therefore, to peace. Christopher Hill claims that modern participants in the Olympic movement may defend this particular belief, &quot;in a spirit similar to that in which the Church of England remains attached to the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion, which a Priest in that Church must sign.&quot; In other words, that they may not wholly believe it but hold to it for historical reasons.

Questions have also been raised about the veracity of Coubertin&#x27;s account of his role in the planning of the 1896 Athens Games. Reportedly, Coubertin played little role in planning, despite entreaties by Vikelas. Young suggests that the story about Coubertin&#x27;s having sketched the velodrome were untrue, and that he had in fact given an interview in which he suggested he did not want Germans to participate. Coubertin later denied this.

Coubertin also spoke against women&#x27;s sports and the Women&#x27;s World Games: &quot;Impractical, uninteresting, unaesthetic, and we are not afraid to add: incorrect, such would be in our opinion this female half-Olympiad.&quot;

== Legacy ==

The traditional Olympic motto &quot;Citius, Altius, Fortius&quot; (Faster, Higher, Stronger) was proposed by Coubertin in 1894, and was official from 1924 until modified to the current &quot;Citius, Altius, Fortius – Communiter&quot; (Faster, Higher, Stronger – Together) in 2021. The traditional motto was coined by Henri Didon OP, a friend of Coubertin, for a Paris youth gathering of 1891.

The Pierre de Coubertin World Trophy given by the International Fair Play Committee has been awarded since 1965 for gestures of fair play in which an athlete impedes their performance to aid a fellow competitor.

The Pierre de Coubertin Medal is a special decoration awarded by the International Olympic Committee since 1997 that &quot;pays tribute to institutions with a pedagogical and educational role and to people who, through their research and the creation of intellectual works in the spirit of Pierre de Coubertin, contribute to the promotion of Olympism.&quot;

A minor planet, 2190 Coubertin, was discovered in 1976 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh and is named in his honour.

The street where the Olympic Stadium in Montreal is located (which hosted the 1976 Summer Olympic Games) was named after Pierre de Coubertin, giving the stadium the address 4549 Pierre de Coubertin Avenue. It is the only Olympic stadium in the world that lies on a street named after Coubertin. There are also two schools in Montreal named after Pierre de Coubertin.

He was portrayed by Louis Jourdan in the 1984 NBC miniseries, &quot;The First Olympics: Athens 1896&quot;.

In 2007, he was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame for his services to the sport of rugby union.

<text>Polish notation (PN), also known as normal Polish notation (NPN), Łukasiewicz notation, Warsaw notation, Polish prefix notation or simply prefix notation, is a mathematical notation in which operators &quot;precede&quot; their operands, in contrast to the more common infix notation, in which operators are placed &quot;between&quot; operands, as well as reverse Polish notation (RPN), in which operators &quot;follow&quot; their operands. It does not need any parentheses as long as each operator has a fixed number of operands. The description &quot;Polish&quot; refers to the nationality of logician Jan Łukasiewicz, who invented Polish notation in 1924.

The term &quot;Polish notation&quot; is sometimes taken (as the opposite of &quot;infix notation&quot;) to also include reverse Polish notation.

When Polish notation is used as a syntax for mathematical expressions by programming language interpreters, it is readily parsed into abstract syntax trees and can, in fact, define a one-to-one representation for the same. Because of this, Lisp (see below) and related programming languages define their entire syntax in prefix notation (and others use postfix notation).

== History ==

A quotation from a paper by Jan Łukasiewicz in 1931 states how the notation was invented:

I came upon the idea of a parenthesis-free notation in 1924. I used that notation for the first time in my article Łukasiewicz (1), p. 610, footnote.

The reference cited by Łukasiewicz, i.e., Łukasiewicz (1), is apparently a lithographed report in Polish. The referring paper by Łukasiewicz was reviewed by Henry A. Pogorzelski in the &quot;Journal of Symbolic Logic&quot; in 1965. Heinrich Behmann, editor in 1924 of the article of Moses Schönfinkel, already had the idea of eliminating parentheses in logic formulas. In one of his papers Łukasiewicz stated that his notation is the most compact and the first linearly written parentheses-free notation, but not the first one as Gottlob Frege proposed his parentheses-free Begriffsschrift notation in 1879 already.

Alonzo Church mentions this notation in his classic book on mathematical logic as worthy of remark in notational systems even contrasted to Alfred Whitehead and Bertrand Russell&#x27;s logical notational exposition and work in Principia Mathematica.

In Łukasiewicz&#x27;s 1951 book, &quot;Aristotle&#x27;s Syllogistic from the Standpoint of Modern Formal Logic&quot;, he mentions that the principle of his notation was to write the functors before the arguments to avoid brackets and that he had employed his notation in his logical papers since 1929. He then goes on to cite, as an example, a 1930 paper he wrote with Alfred Tarski on the sentential calculus.

While no longer used much in logic, Polish notation has since found a place in computer science.

==Explanation==
The expression for adding the numbers 1 and 2 is written in Polish notation as (prefix), rather than as (infix). In more complex expressions, the operators still precede their operands, but the operands may themselves be expressions including again operators and their operands. For instance, the expression that would be written in conventional infix notation as

can be written in Polish notation as

Assuming a given arity of all involved operators (here the &quot;−&quot; denotes the binary operation of subtraction, not the unary function of sign-change), any well-formed prefix representation is unambiguous, and brackets within the prefix expression are unnecessary. As such, the above expression can be further simplified to
The processing of the product is deferred until its two operands are available (i.e., 5 minus 6, and 7). As with &quot;any&quot; notation, the innermost expressions are evaluated first, but in Polish notation this &quot;innermost-ness&quot; can be conveyed by the sequence of operators and operands rather than by bracketing.

In the conventional infix notation, parentheses are required to override the standard precedence rules, since, referring to the above example, moving them

or removing them

changes the meaning and the result of the expression. This version is written in Polish notation as
When dealing with non-commutative operations, like division or subtraction, it is necessary to coordinate the sequential arrangement of the operands with the definition of how the operator takes its arguments, i.e., from left to right. For example, , with 10 to the left of 5, has the meaning of 10 ÷ 5 (read as &quot;divide 10 by 5&quot;), or , with 7 left to 6, has the meaning of 7 − 6 (read as &quot;subtract from 7 the operand 6&quot;).

==Evaluation algorithm==
Prefix/postfix notation is especially popular for its innate ability to express the intended order of operations without the need for parentheses and other precedence rules, as are usually employed with infix notation. Instead, the notation uniquely indicates which operator to evaluate first. The operators are assumed to have a fixed arity each, and all necessary operands are assumed to be explicitly given. A valid prefix expression always starts with an operator and ends with an operand. Evaluation can either proceed from left to right, or in the opposite direction. Starting at the left, the input string, consisting of tokens denoting operators or operands, is pushed token for token on a stack, until the top entries of the stack contain the number of operands that fits to the top most operator (immediately beneath). This group of tokens at the stacktop (the last stacked operator and the according number of operands) is replaced by the result of executing the operator on these/this operand(s). Then the processing of the input continues in this manner. The rightmost operand in a valid prefix expression thus empties the stack, except for the result of evaluating the whole expression. When starting at the right, the pushing of tokens is performed similarly, just the evaluation is triggered by an operator, finding the appropriate number of operands that fits its arity already at the stacktop. Now the leftmost token of a valid prefix expression must be an operator, fitting to the number of operands in the stack, which again yields the result. As can be seen from the description, a push-down store with no capability of arbitrary stack inspection suffices to implement this parsing.

The above sketched stack manipulation works—with mirrored input—also for expressions in reverse Polish notation.

==Polish notation for logic==
The table below shows the core of Jan Łukasiewicz&#x27;s notation in modern logic. Some letters in the Polish notation table stand for particular words in Polish, as shown:

The quantifiers ranged over propositional values in Łukasiewicz&#x27;s work on many-valued logics.

Bocheński introduced a system of Polish notation that names all 16 binary connectives of classical propositional logic. For classical propositional logic, it is a compatible extension of the notation of Łukasiewicz. But the notations are incompatible in the sense that Bocheński uses formula_1 and formula_2 (for nonimplication and converse nonimplication) in propositional logic and Łukasiewicz uses formula_1 and formula_2 in modal logic.

==Implementations==
Prefix notation has seen wide application in Lisp S-expressions, where the parentheses are required since the operators in the language are themselves data (first-class functions). Lisp functions may also be variadic. The Tcl programming language, much like Lisp also uses Polish notation through the mathop library. The Ambi programming language uses Polish notation for arithmetic operations and program construction. LDAP filter syntax uses Polish prefix notation.

Postfix notation is used in many stack-oriented programming languages like PostScript and Forth. CoffeeScript syntax also allows functions to be called using prefix notation, while still supporting the unary postfix syntax common in other languages.

The number of return values of an expression equals the difference between the number of operands in an expression and the total arity of the operators minus the total number of return values of the operators.

Polish notation, usually in postfix form, is the chosen notation of certain calculators, notably from Hewlett-Packard. At a lower level, postfix operators are used by some stack machines such as the Burroughs large systems.

<doc id="25058" wikidata="Q9842" url="?curid=25058" title="Primary school">
<text>A primary school (in Ireland, India, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, South Africa, and Singapore), elementary school, or grade school (in North America and the Philippines) is a school for primary education of children who are 4 to 10 years of age (and in many cases, 11 years of age). Primary schooling follows preschool and precedes secondary schooling.
The International Standard Classification of Education considers primary education as a single phase where programmes are typically designed to provide fundamental skills in reading, writing, and mathematics and to establish a solid foundation for learning. This is ISCED Level 1: Primary education or first stage of basic education.

== Levels of education ==
==Comparison of cohorts==

Within the English speaking world, there are three widely used systems to describe the age of the child. The first is the &quot;equivalent ages&quot;; then countries that base their education systems on the &quot;English model&quot; use one of two methods to identify the year group; while countries that base their systems on the &quot;American K–12 model&quot; refer to their year groups as &quot;grades&quot;. Canada also follows the American model, although its names for year groups are put as a number after the grade: For instance, &quot;Grade 1&quot; in Canada, rather than &quot;First Grade&quot; in the United States. This terminology extends into the research literature.

In Canada, education is a provincial, not a federal responsibility. For example, the province of Ontario also had a &quot;Grade 13&quot;, designed to help students enter the workforce or post-secondary education, but this was phased out in the year 2003.

===Primary schools===

In most parts of the world, primary education is the first stage of compulsory education, and is normally available without charge, but may also be offered by fee-paying independent schools. The term grade school is sometimes used in the US, although both this term and elementary school may refer to the first eight grades, in other words both primary education and lower secondary education.

The term &quot;primary school&quot; is derived from the French &quot;école primaire&quot;, which was first used in an English text in 1802. In the United Kingdom, &quot;elementary education&quot; was taught in &quot;elementary schools&quot; until 1944, when free elementary education was proposed for students over 11: there were to be primary elementary schools and secondary elementary schools; these became known as primary schools and secondary schools.

* &quot;Primary school&quot; is the preferred term in the United Kingdom, Ireland and many Commonwealth nations, and in most publications of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
* &quot;Elementary school&quot; is still preferred in some countries, especially in the United States and Canada.

In some parts of the United States, &quot;primary school&quot; refers to a school covering kindergarten through to second grade or third grade (K through 2 or 3); the &quot;elementary school&quot; includes grade three through five or grades four to six. In Canada, &quot;elementary school&quot; almost everywhere refers to Grades 1 through 6; with Kindergarten being referred to as &quot;preschool.&quot;

* In South Africa, primary school starts from Grade R (age 5–6) till Grade 7 (age 12–13). It typically comes after preschool and before secondary school.

===Elementary schools===

Though often used as a synonym, &quot;elementary school&quot; has specific meanings in different locations.

* Elementary schools, also known as board schools, were first established in England and Wales by Elementary Education Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 75). Most of these schools became primary schools in the late 1940s, following the historic compromise in the Education Act 1944.
* Elementary schools in the United States were first promoted in 1647 in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Today, there are currently approximately 92,858 elementary schools (68,173 public, 24,685 private). In the United States, elementary schools usually have six grades with pupils aged between 5 and 11 years old. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 was designed to fund primary and secondary education. It also emphasized equal access to education and established high standards and accountability.
* Elementary schools in Japan were first established by 1875. In Japan, the age of pupils in elementary school ranges from 6 to 12, after which the pupils enter junior high school.

==Theoretical framework of primary school design==
School building design does not happen in isolation. The building (or school campus) needs to accommodate:

* Curriculum content
* Teaching methods
* Costs
* Education within the political framework
* Use of school building (also in the community setting)
* Constraints imposed by the site
* Design philosophy
Each country will have a different education system and priorities. Schools need to accommodate students, staff, storage, mechanical and electrical systems, support staff, ancillary staff and administration. The number of rooms required can be determined from the predicted roll of the school and the area needed.

According to standards used in the United Kingdom, a general classroom for 30 reception class or infant (Keystage 1) students needs to be 62 m2, or 55 m2 for juniors (Keystage 2). Examples are given on how this can be configured for a 210 place primary with attached 26 place nursery and two-storey 420 place (two form entry) primary school with attached 26 place nursery.

== Building design specifications ==


The building providing the education has to fulfill the needs of: The students, the teachers, the non-teaching support staff, the administrators and the community. It has to meet general government building guidelines, health requirements, minimal functional requirements for classrooms, toilets and showers, electricity and services, preparation and storage of textbooks and basic teaching aids. An optimum school will meet the minimum conditions and will have:

* adequately sized classrooms—where 60 m2 in considered optimum but 80 m2 for the reception class
* specialised teaching spaces
* a staff preparation room
* staff welfare facilities
* an administration block
* multipurpose classrooms
* student toilet facilities
* a general purpose school hall
* adequate equipment
* storage
* a library or library stocks that are regularly renewed
* computer rooms or media centres
* counselling, sick and medical examination rooms

Government accountants having read the advice then publish minimum guidelines on schools. These enable environmental modelling and establishing building costs. Future design plans are audited to ensure that these standards are met but not exceeded. Government ministries continue to press for the &#x27;minimum&#x27; space and cost standards to be reduced.

The UK government published this downwardly revised space formula for primary schools in 2014. It said the floor area should be 350 m2 + 4.1 m2/pupil place. The external finishes were to be downgraded to meet a build cost of £1113/m2.

==Governance and funding==
There are several main ways of funding a school: by the state through general taxation, by a pressure group such as a mosque or church, by a charity, by contributions from parents, or by a combination of these methods. Day-to-day oversight of the school can through a board of governors, the pressure group, or the owner.

The United Kingdom allows elementary education to be delivered in church schools, whereas in France this is illegal as there is strict separation of church and state.

==Accountability==
This can be through informal assessment by the staff and governors such as in Finland, or by a state run testing regime such as Ofsted in the United Kingdom.

<doc id="25061" wikidata="Q1216" url="?curid=25061" title="Piedmont">
<text>Piedmont ( ; ; ), located in northwest Italy, is one of the 20 regions of Italy. It borders the Liguria region to the south, the Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna regions to the east, and the Aosta Valley region to the northwest. Piedmont also borders Switzerland to the north and France to the west. 

Piedmont has an area of , making it the second-largest region of Italy after Sicily. As of 31 January 2021, the population was 4,269,714. The capital of Piedmont is Turin, which was also the capital of the Kingdom of Italy from 1861 to 1865.

==Toponymy==
The French &quot;Piedmont&quot;, the Italian &quot;Piemonte&quot;, and other variant cognates come from the medieval Latin or , i.e. , meaning &quot;at the foot of the mountains&quot; (referring to the Alps), attested in documents from the end of the 12th century.

== Geography ==


Piedmont is surrounded on three sides by the Alps, including Monviso, where the river Po rises, and Monte Rosa. It borders France (Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur), Switzerland (Ticino and Valais), and the Italian regions of Lombardy, Liguria, Aosta Valley, and for a very small part with Emilia Romagna. The geography of Piedmont is 43.3% mountainous, along with extensive areas of hills (30.3%) and plains (26.4%).

Piedmont is the second largest of Italy&#x27;s 20 regions, after Sicily. It is broadly coincident with the upper part of the drainage basin of the river Po, which rises from the slopes of Monviso in the west of the region and is Italy&#x27;s largest river. The Po drains the semicircle formed by the Alps and Apennines, which surround the region on three sides.
The countryside is very diverse: from the rugged peaks of the massifs of Monte Rosa and Gran Paradiso to the damp rice paddies of Vercelli and Novara, from the gentle hillsides of the Langhe, Roero, and Montferrat to the plains. 7.6% of the entire territory is considered protected area. There are 56 different national or regional parks; one of the most famous is the Gran Paradiso National Park, between Piedmont and the Aosta Valley.

Piedmont has a typically temperate climate, which on the Alps becomes progressively temperate-cold and colder as it climbs to altitude. In areas located at low altitudes, winters are relatively cold but not very rainy and often sunny, with the possibility of snowfall, sometimes abundant. Snowfall, on the other hand, is less frequent and occasional in the northeast areas. Summers are hot with local possibilities of strong thunderstorms.
=== Major towns and cities ===
Below are listed other towns of Piedmont with more than 20,000 inhabitants sorted by population.

== History ==
Piedmont was inhabited in early historic times by Celtic-Ligurian tribes such as the Taurini and the Salassi. They were later subdued by the Romans (), who founded several colonies there including &quot;Augusta Taurinorum&quot; (Turin) and &quot;Eporedia&quot; (Ivrea). After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the region was successively invaded by the Burgundians, the Ostrogoths (5th century), East Romans, Lombards (6th century), and Franks (773).

In the 9th–10th centuries there were further incursions by the Magyars, Saracens and Muslim Moors. At the time Piedmont, as part of the Kingdom of Italy within the Holy Roman Empire, was subdivided into several marches and counties. In 1046, Otto of Savoy added Piedmont to the County of Savoy, with a capital at Chambéry (now in France). Other areas remained independent, such as the powerful &quot;comuni&quot; (municipalities) of Asti and Alessandria and the marquisates of Saluzzo and Montferrat. The County of Savoy became the Duchy of Savoy in 1416, and Duke Emanuele Filiberto moved the seat to Turin in 1563. In 1720, the Duke of Savoy became King of Sardinia, founding what evolved into the Kingdom of Sardinia and increasing Turin&#x27;s importance as a European capital.

The Republic of Alba was created in 1796 as a French client republic in Piedmont. A new client republic, the Piedmontese Republic, existed between 1798 and 1799 before it was reoccupied by Austrian and Russian troops. In June 1800 a third client republic, the Subalpine Republic, was established in Piedmont. It fell under full French control in 1801 and it was annexed by France in September 1802. In the Congress of Vienna, the Kingdom of Sardinia was restored and furthermore received the Republic of Genoa to strengthen it as a barrier against France.

Piedmont was a springboard for Italian unification in 1859–1861, following earlier unsuccessful wars against the Austrian Empire in 1820–1821, and 1848–1849. This process is sometimes referred to as &quot;Piedmontisation&quot;. The efforts were later countered by the efforts of rural farmers. The House of Savoy became Kings of Italy, and Turin briefly became the capital of Italy. However, when the Italian capital was moved to Florence, and then to Rome, the administrative and institutional importance of Piedmont was reduced. The only recognition of Piedmont&#x27;s historical role was that the crown prince of Italy was known as the Prince of Piedmont. After Italian unification, Piedmont was one of the most important regions in the first Italian industrialization.

== Economy ==
The gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 137.4 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 7.8% of Italy&#x27;s GDP. GDP per capita at purchasing power parity was 31,300 euros or 104% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 111% of the EU average. Since 2006, the Piemonte Agency for Investments, Export and Tourism began to facilitate outside investment and promote Piedmont&#x27;s industry and tourism. It was the first Italian institution to combine the activities being carried out by pre-existing local organizations to promote the territory internationally.

=== Automotive ===
The region contains major industrial centres, the most important of which is Turin, home to the Fiat conglomerate, but mass-market Fiat cars are not produced anymore, only small-scale manufacturing of luxury Maserati cars (36,702 in 2020). Most of the ex-Fiat plants now belong to other companies: aerospace is owned by Leonardo S.p.A., turbo jet engines by General Electric, high-speed trains by Alstom, bearings by SKF. Fiat does not exist anymore as an independent company; car production belongs to Stellantis, and trucks, buses, tractors, agriculture and construction machines are produced by the independent company CNH Industrial (most manufacturing activity takes place in the United States, in Piedmont only the production of New Holland excavators in San Mauro Torinese and IVECO diesel engines in Turin). Neither of them are headquartered in Turin anymore, however, some research and development centres are still working. 

Formerly famous automotive design companies also were sold to global automotive groups: Italdesign Giugiaro to Volkswagen, Ghia to Ford, Pininfarina to Mahindra; Bertone went into bankruptcy in 2014. The massive decline in the automotive industry caused other regions like Veneto (€163 billion in 2018) and Emilia-Romagna (€161 billion in 2018) to surpass Piedmont (€137 billion in 2018) in GDP and led to relative high unemployment. The peak of Italian motor vehicle production is reached in 1989 with 2.22 million units, but in 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy) it was only 0.92 million units. Even existing Italian car production now relocated to South Italy, such as in Pomigliano d&#x27;Arco (140,478 in 2020), Melfi (229,848 in 2020), and Atessa (257,026 in 2020), because of cost cutting. 

There are some automotive suppliers of: 
* exhaust systems, electronic systems, suspension systems and automotive lighting in Venaria Reale and Rivalta di Torino from Magneti Marelli
* dual-clutch transmission, gearboxes, drivelines and their mechatronics components from Dana Graziano 
* bearings from SKF
* tires (Michelin and Pirelli)

=== Electronics and industrial equipment ===
There are some important companies in high-tech manufacturing: Comau (industrial robots) and Prima Industrie (laser equipment). Silicon wafer production is in Novara by MEMC. Olivetti, once a major electronics industry whose plants were in Scarmagno and Ivrea, has now turned into a small-scale computer service company and no longer produces computers. Leonardo Elettronica in Turin-Caselle develops and manufactures airborne mission systems and airborne computers. Machine building has a long tradition in Piedmont with the manufacturing of excavators, telescopic handlers, industrial refrigerators, printing machines, paper machines, packaging machines, glass machines, turbines, and high-speed trains.

=== Aerospace and defence ===
One of the most important industries in Piedmont is military aerospace with plants:

* Leonardo Aircraft Turin-Caselle (Nord and Sud), final assembly of multi-role attack jet Eurofighter Typhoon, ground-attack jet AMX and military transport aircraft C-27J Spartan

* Leonardo Aircraft Novara-Cameri, final assembly of stealth multi-role attack jet Lockheed Martin F-35

* General Electric Avio Aero in Rivalta di Torino, Turin-Sangone, Borgaretto, manufacturing of mechanical transmissions for gas turbine, foundry

* Avio in Turin, final assembly of rocket Vega 

=== Information technology ===
Piedmont has several notable IT firms such as Olivetti and Arduino.

===Wool textiles===
Italy is the world&#x27;s largest exporter of carded (71.8% in 2018) and combed (73.4% in 2018) wool fabrics. These are the only two types of fabrics not dominated by Chinese textile exports. There are three industrial districts that process wool in Italy. One of them, Biella, is located in Piedmont. 

Below are showed some basic stages of wool processing (not complete).
===Jewellery===
One of Italy&#x27;s four industrial jewellery districts is located in Valenza. Large jewellery companies such as Damiani, Bulgari, and Cartier have factories here as do many other smaller companies. 

===Agriculture===
Lowland Piedmont is a fertile agricultural region. The main agricultural products in Piedmont are cereals, including rice, representing more than 10% of national production, maize, grapes for wine-making, fruit and milk. With more than 800,000 head of cattle in 2000, livestock production accounts for half of total agricultural production in Piedmont.

Piedmont is one of the great winegrowing regions in Italy. More than half of its of vineyards are registered with DOC designations. It produces prestigious wines as Barolo and Barbaresco from the Langhe near Alba, and the Moscato d&#x27;Asti and sparkling Asti from the vineyards around Asti. The city of Asti is about east of Turin in the plain of the Tanaro River and is one of the most important centres of Montferrat, one of the best known Italian wine districts in the world, declared officially on 22 June 2014 a UNESCO World Heritage site. Indigenous grape varieties include Nebbiolo, Barbera, Dolcetto, Freisa, Grignolino and Brachetto.

===Tourism===

Tourism in Piedmont employs 75,534 people and involves 17,367 companies operating in the hospitality and catering sector, with 1,473 hotels and other tourist accommodation. The sector generates a turnover of €2,671 million, 3.3% of the €80,196 million total estimated spending on tourism in Italy. The region is popular with both foreign visitors and those from other parts of Italy. In 2002 there were 2,651,068 total arrivals, 1,124,696 (42%) of whom were foreign. The traditional leading areas for tourism in Piedmont are the Lake District (&quot;Piedmont&#x27;s riviera&quot;), which accounts for 32.84% of total overnight stays, and the metropolitan area of Turin, which accounts for 26.51%.

In 2006, Turin hosted the XX Olympic Winter Games, and in 2007 it hosted the XXIII Universiade. Alpine tourism tends to concentrate in a few highly developed stations like Alagna Valsesia and Sestriere. Around 1980, the long-distance trail Grande Traversata delle Alpi (GTA) was created to draw more attention to the variety of remote, sparsely inhabited valleys. Within the tourism industry in Piedmont, a reference to the system of Royal Residences has to be made. First of all, it is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1997 and, secondly, it represents a peculiarity of the region, since such a network cannot be found elsewhere in Italy. The Residences of the Royal House of Savoy belong to the historical and cultural heritage of Piedmont and nowadays they play a central role in the tourism field. In a reality in which the tourism industry is characterized by an amalgam of several players and stakeholders, the creation of a system or network like the one of the Royal Residences represents an added benefit for the whole territory as well as a competitive edge. Therefore, considering that tourism is a key factor in the creation of long-lasting value and working in a cooperative and collaborative perspective is essential, the network of the Royal Residences represents an example worth of notice.

Piedmont has many small and picturesque villages, 20 of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities. These villages are:

*Barolo
*Castagnole delle Lanze
*Cella Monte
*Chianale
*Cocconato
*Garbagna
*Garessio
*Guarene
*Ingria
*Mombaldone
*Monforte d&#x27;Alba
*Neive
*Orta San Giulio
*Ostana
*Ricetto di Candelo
*Rosazza
*Usseauso
*Vho
*Vogogna
*Volpedo

=== Unemployment ===
The unemployment rate stood at 6.2% in 2023.
==Transport==
=== Air ===

Turin-Caselle International Airport has domestic and international flights and handle 3,952,158 passengers and 3,334 tons of cargo in 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic).

=== Land ===
There are links with neighbouring France via the Fréjus and Colle di Tenda tunnels as well as the Montgenèvre Pass. Piedmont also connects with Switzerland by the Simplon and Great St Bernard passes. It is possible to reach Switzerland via a normal road that crosses eastern Piedmont, starting from Arona and ending in Locarno, on the Swiss border. The region has the longest motorway network amongst the Italian regions, covering approximately . It radiates from Turin, connecting it with the other provinces in the region, as well as with the other regions in Italy. In 2001, the number of passenger cars per 1,000 inhabitants was 623 (above the national average of 575). There is a Turin–Milan high-speed railway; the travel time is only 52 minutes.

== Education ==

The economy of Piedmont is anchored on a rich history of state support for higher education, including some of the leading universities in Italy. Piedmont is home to the famous University of Turin, the Polytechnic University of Turin, the University of Eastern Piedmont, and more recently the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute.

== Demographics ==


The population density in Piedmont is lower than the national average. In 2008, it was equal to 174 inhabitants per km2, compared to the national figure of about 200. The Metropolitan City of Turin has 335 inhabitants per km2, whereas Verbano-Cusio-Ossola is the least densely populated province, with 72 inhabitants per km2.

The population of Piedmont followed a downward trend throughout the 1980s, a result of the natural negative balance (of some 3 to 4% per year), while the migratory balance since 1986 has again become positive because of immigration. The population remained stable in the 1990s.

The Turin metro area grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s due to an increase of immigrants from southern Italy and Veneto and today it has a population of approximately two million. , the Italian national institute of statistics (ISTAT) estimated that 310,543 foreign-born immigrants lived in Piedmont, equal to 7.0% of the total regional population. Most immigrants come from Eastern Europe (mostly from Romania, Albania, and Ukraine) with smaller communities of African immigrants.

== Government and politics ==

The Regional Government (&quot;Giunta Regionale&quot;) is presided by the president of the region (&quot;presidente della regione&quot;), who is elected for a five-year term and is composed of the president and 14 ministers, including a vice president (&quot;vice presidente&quot;). In the 2010 Piedmontese regional election, which took place on 29–30 March, Roberto Cota of Lega Nord defeated incumbent Mercedes Bresso of the Democratic Party (PD). For the 2014 Piedmontese regional election, Cota chose not to stand again for president and the parties composing his coalition failed to agree on a single candidate, resulting in a landslide victory for Sergio Chiamparino, a member of the PD who had been mayor of Turin from 2001 to 2011. Chiamparino was in charge until the 2019 Piedmontese regional election, when Alberto Cirio of Forza Italia became the new president of the region.

=== Administrative divisions ===
Piedmont is divided into eight provinces.

==Culture==
===Languages===

As in the rest of Italy, Italian is the official national language. The main local languages are Piedmontese, Insubric (spoken in the eastern part of the region), Occitan (spoken by a minority in the Occitan Valleys situated in the Province of Cuneo and the Metropolitan City of Turin), and Franco-Provençal (spoken by another minority in the alpine heights of the Metropolitan City of Turin), like in the Susa Valley and Walser (spoken by a minority in the Province of Vercelli and Province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola).

===Cuisine===


Piedmontese cuisine is the style of cooking in the Northern Italian region of Piedmont. Bordering France and Switzerland, Piedmontese cuisine is partly influenced by French cuisine; this is demonstrated in particular by the importance of appetizers, a set of courses that precede what is traditionally called a first course and aimed at whetting the appetite. In France these courses are fewer and are called &quot;entrée&quot;.

It is a region in Italy with the largest number of cheeses and wines. The most prestigious Italian culinary school, the University of Gastronomic Sciences, was founded in Piedmont. Similar to other Northern Italian cuisines, veal, wine, and butter are among the main ingredients used in cooking.

Some well-known dishes include &quot;agnolotti&quot;, &quot;vitello tonnato&quot; (also popular in Argentina), and &quot;bagna càuda&quot;. Piedmont is also credited for the famous pasta dish tagliolini (&quot;tajarin&quot; in Piedmontese). &quot;Tagliolini&quot; are a type of egg pasta normally made fresh by hand. According to Italian writer and journalist Massimo Alberini, &quot;tagliolini&quot; was among King Victor Emmanuel II&#x27;s preferred dishes.

Common in Verbano-Cusio-Ossola area are &quot;bruscitti&quot;, originating from Alto Milanese, a dish of braised meat cut very thin and cooked in wine and fennel seeds, historically obtained by stripping leftover meat.

The Slow Food Movement was started in Piedmont by Carlo Petrini who was from the town of Bra, Piedmont. The movement greatly benefited the region by highlighting Piedmont&#x27;s diverse cuisine. The Slow Food Movement offices are still headquartered in the town of Bra. 

The town of Alba is known for its gourmet food. It is also the region where Alba white truffles are found. 

Since 2006, the Piedmont region has benefited from the start of the Slow Food movement and Terra Madre, events that highlighted the rich agricultural and viticultural value of the Po Valley and northern Italy.

==Sport==

In association football, notable clubs in Piedmont include Turin-based Juventus and Torino, who have won 43 official top-flight league championships (as of the 2020–21 season) between them (36 titles won by Juventus and seven by Torino), more than any other city in Italy. Juventus is the most successful club in Italy, having won the most league titles (36), Coppa Italia titles (14), and Supercoppa Italiana titles (9) of any team in the country; Juventus Women, established in 2017, also achieved success, immediately becoming one of the country&#x27;s most successful women&#x27;s teams. Other smaller teams include the old &quot;Piedmont Quadrilateral&quot; components Novara, Alessandria, Casale, and Pro Vercelli. With the pre-World War II success of Pro Vercelli in 1910s and Juventus in 1930s, as well as winning cycles of Torino during the &quot;Grande Torino&quot; years and Juventus in different eras since 1950, the region became the most successful in terms of championships won. Casale and Novese contributed with one &quot;scudetto&quot; each. Other local teams include volleyball teams Cuneo (male) and AGIL Novara (female), basketball teams Biella Basketball and Junior Casale, ice hockey team Hockey Club Turin, and roller hockey side Amatori Vercelli, who have won three league titles, an Italian Cup, and two CERS Cups. 

Turin hosted the 2006 Winter Olympics. The 2006 Winter Olympics (), officially the XX Olympic Winter Games () and also known as Torino 2006, were a winter multi-sport event held from 10 to 26 February in Turin, Italy. This marked the second time Italy had hosted the Winter Olympics, the first being in 1956 in Cortina d&#x27;Ampezzo; Italy had also hosted the Summer Olympics in 1960 in Rome. Turin was selected as the host city for the 2006 Games in June 1999. The official motto of Torino 2006 was &quot;Passion lives here&quot;. The Games&#x27; logo depicted a stylized profile of the Mole Antonelliana building, drawn in white and blue ice crystals, signifying the snow and the sky. The crystal web was also meant to portray the web of new technologies and the Olympic spirit of community. The 2006 Olympic mascots were Neve (&quot;snow&quot; in Italian), a female snowball, and Gliz, a male ice cube.

<text>[[Palestinians]]hold a diverse range of views on the [[Peace process in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict|peace process]] with Israel, though the goal that unites them is the end of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Some Palestinians accept a two-state solution, with the West Bank and the Gaza Strip forming a distinct Palestinian state, whereas other Palestinians insist on a one-state solution (Palestinian or binational) with equal rights for all citizens whether they are Muslims, Christians or Jews. In this scenario, Palestinian refugees may be allowed to resettle the land they were forced to flee in the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight. 

==Background==
Palestinians have held diverse views and perceptions of the peace process. A key starting point for understanding these views is an awareness of the differing objectives sought by advocates of the Palestinian cause. &#x27;New Historian&#x27; Israeli academic Ilan Pappe says the cause of the conflict from a Palestinian point of view dates back to 1948 with the creation of Israel (rather than Israel’s views of 1967 being the crucial point and the return of occupied territories being central to peace negotiations), and that the conflict has been a fight to bring home refugees to a Palestinian state. Therefore, this for some was the ultimate aim of the peace process, and for groups such as Hamas still is. However, Jerome Slater says that this ‘maximalist’ view of a destruction of Israel in order to regain Palestinian lands, a view held by Arafat and the PLO initially, has steadily moderated from the late 1960s onwards to a preparedness to negotiate and instead seek a two-state solution. The Oslo Accords demonstrated the recognition of this acceptance by the then Palestinian leadership of the State of Israel’s right to exist in return for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and West Bank. However, there are recurrent themes prevalent throughout peace process negotiations including a feeling that Israel offers too little and a mistrust of its actions and motives. Yet, the demand for the Right of Return by descendants of Palestinian refugees to Israel has remained a cornerstone of the Palestinian view and has been repeatedly enunciated by Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas.

==Yasser Arafat and the PLO==


The PLO has complex, often contradictory attitudes to peace with Israel. Officially, the PLO accepted Israel&#x27;s right to exist in peace, which was the first of the PLO&#x27;s obligations under the Oslo Accords. In Yasser Arafat&#x27;s 9 September 1993 letter to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, as part of the first Oslo Accord, Arafat stated that &quot;The PLO recognizes the right of the State of Israel to exist in peace and security.&quot; These remarks from Arafat were seen as a shift from one of the PLO&#x27;s previous primary aims—the destruction of Israel.

However, during the 1990s and 2000s the PLO leadership has stated that it considered any peace with Israel was to be temporary until the dream of Israel&#x27;s destruction could be realized. Arafat often spoke of the peace process in terms of &quot;justice&quot; for the Palestinians; terms British-Israeli historian Efraim Karsh described as &quot;euphemisms rooted in Islamic and Arabic history for the liberation of the whole of Palestine from &#x27;foreign occupiers.&#x27;&quot; When describing his views of the peace process among Arab leaders and in the media of the Arab world, Arafat&#x27;s rhetoric became noticeably more bellicose than it was when among Western leaders and media outside of the Arab world. The period saw a disconnect between what the PLO&#x27;s second in command Abu Iyad referred to as &quot;the language of peace&quot; and support of fighting Israel.

Since the 1990s, there has been a debate within the PLO as to whether to halt fighting with Israel completely or to continue attacking Israel as well as negotiate diplomatically with Israel. In practice, violence was never fully banned. Furthermore, assassination attempts by radical Palestinian factions within the PLO since the early years of the peace process kept Arafat from expressing full, public support of the peace process or condemnation of violence without risking further danger to his own life.

In 2000, Arafat participated in the Camp David Summit with Ehud Barak. Arafat rejected Israel&#x27;s offer because it did not include Palestinian control of East Jerusalem or the right of return of Palestinian refugees. In response, Barak stated that Israel had &quot;no partner&quot; in peace, and Israelis increasingly viewed Palestinians as unwilling to make peace. Israeli-British historian Efraim Karsh referred to Arafat&#x27;s insistence on the right of return as aiming for &quot;Israel’s destruction through demographic subversion”. Similarly, Alan Dershowitz stated that Arafat put his desire to destroy Israel above his dream of building a Palestinian state.

In 2009, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat pointed to stopping Israeli settlements on Palestinian land and a plan for a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders as the highest Palestinian priorities in peace talks. Peace talks between Israel and Arafat&#x27;s successor, Mahmoud Abbas, have made little progress due to the continued increase of Israeli settlements in the West Bank. 

==Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad==

In 1981, an offshoot of the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood called Islamic Jihad was founded. Unlike the Muslim Brotherhood, they declined to negotiate with Israel and focused on armed conflict with Israel rather than Islamic education. The Muslim Brotherhood became increasingly supportive of armed resistance and eventually decided to form Hamas.

Established in 1988 during the First Intifada, Hamas&#x27;s founding charter refers to modern-day Israel and Palestine as &quot;an Islamic land entrusted to the Muslim generations&quot;. It rejects the validity of the State of Israel and emphasizes the importance of armed resistance for Palestinian liberation. The document is often characterized as calling for the destruction of Israel. 

While the PLO pursued the Oslo Accords and other plans for peace with Israel, Hamas opposed them and engaged in suicide attacks on Israelis in the 1990s. The attacks, intended to prevent the peace talks from progressing, contributed to both Israeli disillusionment with the peace process and the election of Benjamin Netanyahu, who also opposed the Oslo Accords. Polling showed that most Palestinians opposed the suicide attacks.

Hamas considered the PLO&#x27;s strategy of peace talks with Israel to be a &quot;path of surrender&quot; that would lead to a “life of humiliation [under] a despicable occupation&quot; due to the PLO&#x27;s agreement to adopt responsibility for security in the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority. After the collapse of the 2000 Camp David Summit, Hamas urged the PLO to join their &quot;jihadist project for our struggle&quot;. 

When the Second Intifada broke out, Hamas and Islamic Jihad participated. Hamas viewed violence as a tool for deterring Israeli attacks and gaining concessions from Israel, and many Palestinians saw it as justified due to Israeli actions, including building settlements in the West Bank. Hamas undertook a ceasefire with Israel in August 2004. The Palestinian Islamic Jihad was unhappy with the ceasefire. In September 2005, Hamas was criticized by Islamic Jihad for calling off rocket attacks on Israel from Gaza.

According to a March 2006 poll, 70% of Hamas supporters said they would want peace with Israel if a Palestinian state was established. Beginning in 2006, Hamas has called for a Palestinian state along the 1967 borders. In 2008, Hamas publicly offered a long-term hudna (truce) with Israel if Israel agreed to return to the 1967 borders and to allow the right of return to all Palestinian refugees. In 2010, Hamas Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh announced that Hamas would accept the outcome of a Palestinian referendum on a peace treaty with Israel even if the results were not in line with their ideology. Additionally he said that Hamas would &quot;accept a Palestinian state on the borders of 1967, with Jerusalem as its capital, the release of Palestinian prisoners, and the resolution of the issue of refugees.&quot; This represented a departure from Hamas&#x27;s earlier opposition to ceding any land of historic Palestine to Israel. 

In 2012, Mousa Abu Marzook, a high-ranking Hamas official in competition with Haniyeh for Hamas&#x27; top leadership post, gave an interview in which he expressed a range of opinions, some of which differed from the organisation&#x27;s actual stance. He said that Hamas will not recognize Israel and will not feel bound to understand a peace treaty negotiated by Fatah as a recognition of Israel, calling instead for a &quot;hudna&quot; (temporary truce). Abu Marzook echoed Haniyeh&#x27;s demand that Palestinians should be given the unconditional right to return into what is now Israel proper.

==Prominent Palestinians==

Rashid Abu Shbak, a senior PA security official declared, &quot;The light which has shone over Gaza and Jericho [when the PA assumed control over those areas] will also reach the Negev and the Galilee [which constitute a large portion of pre-1967 Israel].&quot;

The PA&#x27;s Voice of Palestine radio station broadcast a Friday prayer sermon by Yusuf Abu Sneineh, official preacher at Jerusalem&#x27;s Al-Aqsa Mosque, over the radio. In it, he asserted, &quot;The struggle we are waging is an ideological struggle and the question is: where has the Islamic land of Palestine gone? Where [are] Haifa and Jaffa, Lod and Ramle, Acre, Safed and Tiberias? Where is Hebron and Jerusalem?&quot;

PA cabinet minister Abdul Aziz Shaheen told the official PA newspaper, &quot;Al-Havat Al-Jadida&quot;, on January 4, 1998, &quot;The Oslo accord was a preface for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian Authority will be a preface for the Palestinian state which, in its turn, will be a preface for the liberation of the entire Palestinian land.&quot;

Faisal Husseini, former Palestinian Authority Minister for Jerusalem, compared the Al-Aqsa Intifada following the Oslo peace process to the tactic of coming out of the Trojan Horse used by the Greeks in the myth of the Trojan War.

<doc id="25063" wikidata="Q3406712" url="?curid=25063" title="Product of rings">
<text>In mathematics, a product of rings or direct product of rings is a ring that is formed by the Cartesian product of the underlying sets of several rings (possibly an infinity), equipped with componentwise operations. It is a direct product in the category of rings.

Since direct products are defined up to an isomorphism, one says colloquially that a ring is the product of some rings if it is isomorphic to the direct product of these rings. For example, the Chinese remainder theorem may be stated as: if and are coprime integers, the quotient ring formula_1 is the product of formula_2 and formula_3

==Examples==
An important example is Z/&quot;n&quot;Z, the ring of integers modulo &quot;n&quot;. If &quot;n&quot; is written as a product of prime powers (see Fundamental theorem of arithmetic),

:formula_4

where the &quot;pi&quot; are distinct primes, then Z/&quot;n&quot;Z is naturally isomorphic to the product

:formula_5
This follows from the Chinese remainder theorem.

==Properties==
If is a product of rings, then for every &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot; we have a surjective ring homomorphism which projects the product on the &quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;th coordinate. The product &quot;R&quot; together with the projections &quot;pi&quot; has the following universal property: 
:if &quot;S&quot; is any ring and is a ring homomorphism for every &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;, then there exists &quot;precisely one&quot; ring homomorphism such that for every &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;.
This shows that the product of rings is an instance of products in the sense of category theory. 

When &quot;I&quot; is finite, the underlying additive group of coincides with the direct sum of the additive groups of the &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;. In this case, some authors call &quot;R&quot; the &quot;direct sum of the rings &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot;&quot; and write , but this is incorrect from the point of view of category theory, since it is usually not a coproduct in the category of rings (with identity): for example, when two or more of the &quot;R&quot;&quot;i&quot; are non-trivial, the inclusion map fails to map 1 to 1 and hence is not a ring homomorphism.

(A finite coproduct in the category of commutative algebras over a commutative ring is a tensor product of algebras. A coproduct in the category of algebras is a free product of algebras.)

Direct products are commutative and associative up to natural isomorphism, meaning that it doesn&#x27;t matter in which order one forms the direct product.

If &quot;Ai&quot; is an ideal of &quot;Ri&quot; for each &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;, then is an ideal of &quot;R&quot;. If &quot;I&quot; is finite, then the converse is true, i.e., every ideal of &quot;R&quot; is of this form. However, if &quot;I&quot; is infinite and the rings &quot;Ri&quot; are non-trivial, then the converse is false: the set of elements with all but finitely many nonzero coordinates forms an ideal which is not a direct product of ideals of the &quot;Ri&quot;. The ideal &quot;A&quot; is a prime ideal in &quot;R&quot; if all but one of the &quot;Ai&quot; are equal to &quot;Ri&quot; and the remaining &quot;Ai&quot; is a prime ideal in &quot;Ri&quot;. However, the converse is not true when &quot;I&quot; is infinite. For example, the direct sum of the &quot;Ri&quot; form an ideal not contained in any such &quot;A&quot;, but the axiom of choice gives that it is contained in some maximal ideal which is a fortiori prime.

An element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;R&quot; is a unit if and only if all of its components are units, i.e., if and only if &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&quot;x&quot;) is a unit in &quot;Ri&quot; for every &quot;i&quot; in &quot;I&quot;. The group of units of &quot;R&quot; is the product of the groups of units of the &quot;Ri&quot;.

A product of two or more non-trivial rings always has nonzero zero divisors: if &quot;x&quot; is an element of the product whose coordinates are all zero except &quot;p&quot;&quot;i&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&quot;x&quot;) and &quot;y&quot; is an element of the product with all coordinates zero except &quot;p&quot;&quot;j&quot;&amp;hairsp;(&quot;y&quot;) where &quot;i&quot; ≠ &quot;j&quot;, then &quot;xy&quot; = 0 in the product ring.

<text>Posthumanism or post-humanism (meaning &quot;after humanism&quot; or &quot;beyond humanism&quot;) is an idea in continental philosophy and critical theory responding to the presence of anthropocentrism in 21st-century thought. Posthumanization comprises &quot;those processes by which a society comes to include members other than &#x27;natural&#x27; biological human beings who, in one way or another, contribute to the structures, dynamics, or meaning of the society.&quot;

It encompasses a wide variety of branches, including:
*&quot;Antihumanism&quot;: a branch of theory that is critical of traditional humanism and traditional ideas about the human condition, vitality and agency.
*&quot;Cultural posthumanism&quot;: A branch of cultural theory critical of the foundational assumptions of humanism and its legacy that examines and questions the historical notions of &quot;human&quot; and &quot;human nature&quot;, often challenging typical notions of human subjectivity and embodiment and strives to move beyond &quot;archaic&quot; concepts of &quot;human nature&quot; to develop ones which constantly adapt to contemporary technoscientific knowledge.
*&quot;Philosophical posthumanism&quot;: A philosophical direction that draws on cultural posthumanism, the philosophical strand examines the ethical implications of expanding the circle of moral concern and extending subjectivities beyond the human species.
*&quot;Posthuman condition&quot;: The deconstruction of the human condition by critical theorists.
*&quot;Existential posthumanism&quot;: it embraces posthumanism as a praxis of existence. Its sources are drawn from non-dualistic global philosophies, such as Advaita Vedanta, Taoism and Zen Buddhism, the philosophies of Yoga, continental existentialism, native epistemologies and Sufism, among others. It examines and challenges hegemonic notions of being &quot;human&quot; by delving into the history of embodied practices of being human and, thus, expanding the reflection on human nature.
*&quot;Posthuman transhumanism&quot;: A transhuman ideology and movement which, drawing from posthumanist philosophy, seeks to develop and make available technologies that enable immortality and greatly enhance human intellectual, physical, and psychological capacities in order to achieve a &quot;posthuman future&quot;.
*&quot;AI takeover&quot;: A variant of transhumanism in which humans will not be enhanced, but rather eventually &quot;replaced&quot; by artificial intelligences. Some philosophers and theorists, including Nick Land, promote the view that humans should embrace and accept their eventual demise as a consequence of a technological singularity. This is related to the view of &quot;cosmism&quot;, which supports the building of strong artificial intelligence even if it may entail the end of humanity, as in their view it &quot;would be a cosmic tragedy if humanity freezes evolution at the puny human level&quot;.
*&quot;Voluntary human extinction&quot;: Seeks a &quot;posthuman future&quot; that in this case is a future without humans.

==Philosophical posthumanism==
Philosopher Theodore Schatzki suggests there are two varieties of posthumanism of the philosophical kind:

One, which he calls &quot;objectivism&quot;, tries to counter the overemphasis of the subjective, or intersubjective, that pervades humanism, and emphasises the role of the nonhuman agents, whether they be animals and plants, or computers or other things, because &quot;Humans and nonhumans, it [objectivism] proclaims, codetermine one another&quot;, and also claims &quot;independence of (some) objects from human activity and conceptualization&quot;.

A second posthumanist agenda is &quot;the prioritization of practices over individuals (or individual subjects)&quot;, which, they say, constitute the individual.

There may be a third kind of posthumanism, propounded by the philosopher Herman Dooyeweerd. Though he did not label it &quot;posthumanism&quot;, he made an immanent critique of humanism, and then constructed a philosophy that presupposed neither humanist, nor scholastic, nor Greek thought but started with a different religious ground motive. Dooyeweerd prioritized law and meaningfulness as that which enables humanity and all else to exist, behave, live, occur, etc. &quot;&quot;Meaning&quot; is the &quot;being&quot; of all that has been &quot;created&quot;&quot;, Dooyeweerd wrote, &quot;and the nature even of our selfhood&quot;. Both human and nonhuman alike function subject to a common &quot;law-side&quot;, which is diverse, composed of a number of distinct law-spheres or &quot;aspects&quot;. The temporal being of both human and non-human is multi-aspectual; for example, both plants and humans are bodies, functioning in the biotic aspect, and both computers and humans function in the formative and lingual aspect, but humans function in the aesthetic, juridical, ethical and faith aspects too. The Dooyeweerdian version is able to incorporate and integrate both the objectivist version and the practices version, because it allows nonhuman agents their own subject-functioning in various aspects and places emphasis on aspectual functioning.

==Emergence of philosophical posthumanism==
Ihab Hassan, theorist in the academic study of literature, once stated: &quot;Humanism may be coming to an end as humanism transforms itself into something one must helplessly call posthumanism.&quot; This view predates most currents of posthumanism which have developed over the late 20th century in somewhat diverse, but complementary, domains of thought and practice. For example, Hassan is a known scholar whose theoretical writings expressly address postmodernity in society. Beyond postmodernist studies, posthumanism has been developed and deployed by various cultural theorists, often in reaction to problematic inherent assumptions within humanistic and enlightenment thought.

Theorists who both complement and contrast Hassan include Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, cyberneticists such as Gregory Bateson, Warren McCullouch, Norbert Wiener, Bruno Latour, Cary Wolfe, Elaine Graham, N. Katherine Hayles, Benjamin H. Bratton, Donna Haraway, Peter Sloterdijk, Stefan Lorenz Sorgner, Evan Thompson, Francisco Varela, Humberto Maturana, Timothy Morton, and Douglas Kellner. Among the theorists are philosophers, such as Robert Pepperell, who have written about a &quot;posthuman condition&quot;, which is often substituted for the term &quot;posthumanism&quot;.

Posthumanism differs from classical humanism by relegating humanity back to one of many natural species, thereby rejecting any claims founded on anthropocentric dominance. According to this claim, humans have no inherent rights to destroy nature or set themselves above it in ethical considerations &quot;a priori&quot;. Human knowledge is also reduced to a less controlling position, previously seen as the defining aspect of the world. Human rights exist on a spectrum with animal rights and posthuman rights. The limitations and fallibility of human intelligence are confessed, even though it does not imply abandoning the rational tradition of humanism.

Proponents of a posthuman discourse, suggest that innovative advancements and emerging technologies have transcended the traditional model of the human, as proposed by Descartes among others associated with philosophy of the Enlightenment period. Posthumanistic views were also found in the works of Shakespeare. In contrast to humanism, the discourse of posthumanism seeks to redefine the boundaries surrounding modern philosophical understanding of the human. Posthumanism represents an evolution of thought beyond that of the contemporary social boundaries and is predicated on the seeking of truth within a postmodern context. In so doing, it rejects previous attempts to establish &quot;anthropological universals&quot; that are imbued with anthropocentric assumptions. Recently, critics have sought to describe the emergence of posthumanism as a critical moment in modernity, arguing for the origins of key posthuman ideas in modern fiction, in Nietzsche, or in a modernist response to the crisis of historicity.

Although Nietzsche&#x27;s philosophy has been characterized as posthumanist, Foucault placed posthumanism within a context that differentiated humanism from Enlightenment thought. According to Foucault, the two existed in a state of tension: as humanism sought to establish norms while Enlightenment thought attempted to transcend all that is material, including the boundaries that are constructed by humanistic thought. Drawing on the Enlightenment&#x27;s challenges to the boundaries of humanism, posthumanism rejects the various assumptions of human dogmas (anthropological, political, scientific) and takes the next step by attempting to change the nature of thought about what it means to be human. This requires not only decentering the human in multiple discourses (evolutionary, ecological and technological) but also examining those discourses to uncover inherent humanistic, anthropocentric, normative notions of humanness and the concept of the human.

==Contemporary posthuman discourse==
Posthumanistic discourse aims to open up spaces to examine what it means to be human and critically question the concept of &quot;the human&quot; in light of current cultural and historical contexts. In her book &quot;How We Became Posthuman&quot;, N. Katherine Hayles, writes about the struggle between different versions of the posthuman as it continually co-evolves alongside intelligent machines. Such coevolution, according to some strands of the posthuman discourse, allows one to extend their subjective understandings of real experiences beyond the boundaries of embodied existence. According to Hayles&#x27;s view of posthuman, often referred to as &quot;technological posthumanism&quot;, visual perception and digital representations thus paradoxically become ever more salient. Even as one seeks to extend knowledge by deconstructing perceived boundaries, it is these same boundaries that make knowledge acquisition possible. The use of technology in a contemporary society is thought to complicate this relationship.

Hayles discusses the translation of human bodies into information (as suggested by Hans Moravec) in order to illuminate how the boundaries of our embodied reality have been compromised in the current age and how narrow definitions of humanness no longer apply. Because of this, according to Hayles, posthumanism is characterized by a loss of subjectivity based on bodily boundaries. This strand of posthumanism, including the changing notion of subjectivity and the disruption of ideas concerning what it means to be human, is often associated with Donna Haraway&#x27;s concept of the cyborg. However, Haraway has distanced herself from posthumanistic discourse due to other theorists&#x27; use of the term to promote utopian views of technological innovation to extend the human biological capacity (even though these notions would more correctly fall into the realm of transhumanism).

While posthumanism is a broad and complex ideology, it has relevant implications today and for the future. It attempts to redefine social structures without inherently humanly or even biological origins, but rather in terms of social and psychological systems where consciousness and communication could potentially exist as unique disembodied entities. Questions subsequently emerge with respect to the current use and the future of technology in shaping human existence, as do new concerns with regards to language, symbolism, subjectivity, phenomenology, ethics, justice and creativity.

==Technological versus non-technological==
Posthumanism can be divided into &quot;non-technological&quot; and &quot;technological&quot; forms.

=== Non-technological posthumanism ===
While posthumanization has links with the scholarly methodologies of posthumanism, it is a distinct phenomenon. The rise of explicit posthumanism as a scholarly approach is relatively recent, occurring since the late 1970s; however, some of the processes of posthumanization that it studies are ancient. For example, the dynamics of &quot;non-technological&quot; posthumanization have existed historically in all societies in which animals were incorporated into families as household pets or in which ghosts, monsters, angels, or semidivine heroes were considered to play some role in the world.

Such non-technological posthumanization has been manifested not only in mythological and literary works but also in the construction of temples, cemeteries, zoos, or other physical structures that were considered to be inhabited or used by quasi- or para-human beings who were not natural, living, biological human beings but who nevertheless played some role within a given society, to the extent that, according to philosopher Francesca Ferrando: &quot;the notion of spirituality dramatically broadens our understanding of the posthuman, allowing us to investigate not only technical technologies (robotics, cybernetics, biotechnology, nanotechnology, among others), but also, technologies of existence.&quot;

=== Technological posthumanism ===
Some forms of technological posthumanization involve efforts to directly alter the social, psychological, or physical structures and behaviors of the human being through the development and application of technologies relating to genetic engineering or neurocybernetic augmentation; such forms of posthumanization are studied, e.g., by cyborg theory. Other forms of technological posthumanization indirectly &quot;posthumanize&quot; human society through the deployment of social robots or attempts to develop artificial general intelligences, sentient networks, or other entities that can collaborate and interact with human beings as members of posthumanized societies.

The dynamics of technological posthumanization have long been an important element of science fiction; genres such as cyberpunk take them as a central focus. In recent decades, technological posthumanization has also become the subject of increasing attention by scholars and policymakers. The expanding and accelerating forces of technological posthumanization have generated diverse and conflicting responses, with some researchers viewing the processes of posthumanization as opening the door to a more meaningful and advanced transhumanist future for humanity, while other bioconservative critiques warn that such processes may lead to a fragmentation of human society, loss of meaning, and subjugation to the forces of technology.

=== Common features ===
Processes of technological and non-technological posthumanization both tend to result in a partial &quot;de-anthropocentrization&quot; of human society, as its circle of membership is expanded to include other types of entities and the position of human beings is decentered. A common theme of posthumanist study is the way in which processes of posthumanization challenge or blur simple binaries, such as those of &quot;human versus non-human&quot;, &quot;natural versus artificial&quot;, &quot;alive versus non-alive&quot;, and &quot;biological versus mechanical&quot;.

==Relationship with transhumanism==
Sociologist James Hughes comments that there is considerable confusion between the two terms. In the introduction to their book on post- and transhumanism, Robert Ranisch and Stefan Sorgner address the source of this confusion, stating that posthumanism is often used as an umbrella term that includes both transhumanism and critical posthumanism.

Although both subjects relate to the future of humanity, they differ in their view of anthropocentrism. Pramod Nayar, author of &quot;Posthumanism&quot;, states that posthumanism has two main branches: ontological and critical. Ontological posthumanism is synonymous with transhumanism. The subject is regarded as &quot;an intensification of humanism&quot;. Transhumanist thought suggests that humans are not post human yet, but that human enhancement, often through technological advancement and application, is the passage of becoming post human. Transhumanism retains humanism&#x27;s focus on the Homo sapiens as the center of the world but also considers technology to be an integral aid to human progression. Critical posthumanism, however, is opposed to these views. Critical posthumanism &quot;rejects both human exceptionalism (the idea that humans are unique creatures) and human instrumentalism (that humans have a right to control the natural world)&quot;. These contrasting views on the importance of human beings are the main distinctions between the two subjects.

Transhumanism is also more ingrained in popular culture than critical posthumanism, especially in science fiction. The term is referred to by Pramod Nayar as &quot;the pop posthumanism of cinema and pop culture&quot;.

==Criticism==
Some critics have argued that all forms of posthumanism, including transhumanism, have more in common than their respective proponents realize. Linking these different approaches, Paul James suggests that &quot;the key political problem is that, in effect, the position allows the human as a category of being to flow down the plughole of history&quot;:

However, some posthumanists in the humanities and the arts are critical of transhumanism (the brunt of James&#x27;s criticism), in part, because they argue that it incorporates and extends many of the values of Enlightenment humanism and classical liberalism, namely scientism, according to performance philosopher Shannon Bell:

While many modern leaders of thought are accepting of nature of ideologies described by posthumanism, some are more skeptical of the term. Haraway, the author of &quot;A Cyborg Manifesto&quot;, has outspokenly rejected the term, though acknowledges a philosophical alignment with posthumanism. Haraway opts instead for the term of companion species, referring to nonhuman entities with which humans coexist.

Questions of race, some argue, are suspiciously elided within the &quot;turn&quot; to posthumanism. Noting that the terms &quot;post&quot; and &quot;human&quot; are already loaded with racial meaning, critical theorist Zakiyyah Iman Jackson argues that the impulse to move &quot;beyond&quot; the human within posthumanism too often ignores &quot;praxes of humanity and critiques produced by black people&quot;, including Frantz Fanon, Aime Cesaire, Hortense Spillers and Fred Moten. Interrogating the conceptual grounds in which such a mode of &quot;beyond&quot; is rendered legible and viable, Jackson argues that it is important to observe that &quot;blackness conditions and constitutes the very nonhuman disruption and/or disruption&quot; which posthumanists invite. In other words, given that race in general and blackness in particular constitute the very terms through which human-nonhuman distinctions are made, for example in enduring legacies of scientific racism, a gesture toward a &quot;beyond&quot; actually &quot;returns us to a Eurocentric transcendentalism long challenged&quot;. Posthumanist scholarship, due to characteristic rhetorical techniques, is also frequently subject to the same critiques commonly made of postmodernist scholarship in the 1980s and 1990s.

<text>A parameter (), generally, is any characteristic that can help in defining or classifying a particular system (meaning an event, project, object, situation, etc.). That is, a parameter is an element of a system that is useful, or critical, when identifying the system, or when evaluating its performance, status, condition, etc.

&quot;Parameter&quot; has more specific meanings within various disciplines, including mathematics, computer programming, engineering, statistics, logic, linguistics, and electronic musical composition.

In addition to its technical uses, there are also extended uses, especially in non-scientific contexts, where it is used to mean defining characteristics or boundaries, as in the phrases &#x27;test parameters&#x27; or &#x27;game play parameters&#x27;.

==Modelization==
When a system is modeled by equations, the values that describe the system are called &quot;parameters&quot;. For example, in mechanics, the masses, the dimensions and shapes (for solid bodies), the densities and the viscosities (for fluids), appear as parameters in the equations modeling movements. There are often several choices for the parameters, and choosing a convenient set of parameters is called &quot;parametrization&quot;.

For example, if one were considering the movement of an object on the surface of a sphere much larger than the object (e.g. the Earth), there are two commonly used parametrizations of its position: angular coordinates (like latitude/longitude), which neatly describe large movements along circles on the sphere, and directional distance from a known point (e.g. &quot;10km NNW of Toronto&quot; or equivalently &quot;8km due North, and then 6km due West, from Toronto&quot; ), which are often simpler for movement confined to a (relatively) small area, like within a particular country or region. Such parametrizations are also relevant to the modelization of geographic areas (i.e. map drawing).

==Mathematical functions==

Mathematical functions have one or more arguments that are designated in the definition by variables. A function definition can also contain parameters, but unlike variables, parameters are not listed among the arguments that the function takes. When parameters are present, the definition actually defines a whole family of functions, one for every valid set of values of the parameters. For instance, one could define a general quadratic function by declaring
:formula_1;

Here, the variable &quot;x&quot; designates the function&#x27;s argument, but &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; are parameters (in this instance, also called &quot;coefficients&quot;) that determine which particular quadratic function is being considered. A parameter could be incorporated into the function name to indicate its dependence on the parameter. For instance, one may define the base-&quot;b&quot; logarithm by the formula
:formula_2
where &quot;b&quot; is a parameter that indicates which logarithmic function is being used. It is not an argument of the function, and will, for instance, be a constant when considering the derivative formula_3.

In some informal situations it is a matter of convention (or historical accident) whether some or all of the symbols in a function definition are called parameters. However, changing the status of symbols between parameter and variable changes the function as a mathematical object. For instance, the notation for the falling factorial power
:formula_4,
defines a polynomial function of &quot;n&quot; (when &quot;k&quot; is considered a parameter), but is not a polynomial function of &quot;k&quot; (when &quot;n&quot; is considered a parameter). Indeed, in the latter case, it is only defined for non-negative integer arguments. More formal presentations of such situations typically start out with a function of several variables (including all those that might sometimes be called &quot;parameters&quot;) such as
:formula_5
as the most fundamental object being considered, then defining functions with fewer variables from the main one by means of currying.

Sometimes it is useful to consider all functions with certain parameters as &quot;parametric family&quot;, i.e. as an indexed family of functions. Examples from probability theory are given further below.

===Examples===
* In a section on frequently misused words in his book &quot;The Writer&#x27;s Art&quot;, James J. Kilpatrick quoted a letter from a correspondent, giving examples to illustrate the correct use of the word &quot;parameter&quot;:

W.M. Woods ... a mathematician ... writes ... &quot;... a variable is one of the many things a &quot;parameter&quot; is not.&quot; ... The dependent variable, the speed of the car, depends on the independent variable, the position of the gas pedal.

[Kilpatrick quoting Woods] &quot;Now ... the engineers ... change the lever arms of the linkage ... the speed of the car ... will still depend on the pedal position ...&quot; but in a ... different manner&quot;. You have changed a parameter&quot;

* A parametric equaliser is an audio filter that allows the frequency of maximum cut or boost to be set by one control, and the size of the cut or boost by another. These settings, the frequency level of the peak or trough, are two of the parameters of a frequency response curve, and in a two-control equaliser they completely describe the curve. More elaborate parametric equalisers may allow other parameters to be varied, such as skew. These parameters each describe some aspect of the response curve seen as a whole, over all frequencies. A graphic equaliser provides individual level controls for various frequency bands, each of which acts only on that particular frequency band.
* If asked to imagine the graph of the relationship &quot;y&quot; = &quot;ax&quot;2, one typically visualizes a range of values of &quot;x&quot;, but only one value of &quot;a&quot;. Of course a different value of &quot;a&quot; can be used, generating a different relation between &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. Thus &quot;a&quot; is a parameter: it is less variable than the variable &quot;x&quot; or &quot;y&quot;, but it is not an explicit constant like the exponent 2. More precisely, changing the parameter &quot;a&quot; gives a different (though related) problem, whereas the variations of the variables &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; (and their interrelation) are part of the problem itself.
* In calculating income based on wage and hours worked (income equals wage multiplied by hours worked), it is typically assumed that the number of hours worked is easily changed, but the wage is more static. This makes &quot;wage&quot; a parameter, &quot;hours worked&quot; an independent variable, and &quot;income&quot; a dependent variable.

===Mathematical models===
In the context of a mathematical model, such as a probability distribution, the distinction between variables and parameters was described by Bard as follows:
:We refer to the relations which supposedly describe a certain physical situation, as a &quot;model&quot;. Typically, a model consists of one or more equations. The quantities appearing in the equations we classify into &quot;variables&quot; and &quot;parameters&quot;. The distinction between these is not always clear cut, and it frequently depends on the context in which the variables appear. Usually a model is designed to explain the relationships that exist among quantities which can be measured independently in an experiment; these are the variables of the model. To formulate these relationships, however, one frequently introduces &quot;constants&quot; which stand for inherent properties of nature (or of the materials and equipment used in a given experiment). These are the parameters.

===Analytic geometry===
In analytic geometry, a curve can be described as the image of a function whose argument, typically called the &quot;parameter&quot;, lies in a real interval.

For example, the unit circle can be specified in the following two ways:

* &quot;implicit&quot; form, the curve is the locus of points in the Cartesian plane that satisfy the relation formula_6
* &quot;parametric&quot; form, the curve is the image of the function formula_7with parameter formula_8 As a parametric equation this can be writtenformula_9The parameter in this equation would elsewhere in mathematics be called the &quot;independent variable&quot;.

===Mathematical analysis===
In mathematical analysis, integrals dependent on a parameter are often considered. These are of the form
:formula_10
In this formula, &quot;t&quot; is the argument of the function &quot;F&quot;, and on the right-hand side the &quot;parameter&quot; on which the integral depends. When evaluating the integral, &quot;t&quot; is held constant, and so it is considered to be a parameter. If we are interested in the value of &quot;F&quot; for different values of &quot;t&quot;, we then consider &quot;t&quot; to be a variable. The quantity &quot;x&quot; is a &quot;dummy variable&quot; or &quot;variable of integration&quot; (confusingly, also sometimes called a &quot;parameter of integration&quot;).

===Statistics and econometrics===

In statistics and econometrics, the probability framework above still holds, but attention shifts to estimating the parameters of a distribution based on observed data, or testing hypotheses about them. In frequentist estimation parameters are considered &quot;fixed but unknown&quot;, whereas in Bayesian estimation they are treated as random variables, and their uncertainty is described as a distribution.

In estimation theory of statistics, &quot;statistic&quot; or estimator refers to samples, whereas &quot;parameter&quot; or estimand refers to populations, where the samples are taken from. A statistic is a numerical characteristic of a sample that can be used as an estimate of the corresponding parameter, the numerical characteristic of the population from which the sample was drawn.

For example, the sample mean (estimator), denoted formula_11, can be used as an estimate of the &quot;mean&quot; parameter (estimand), denoted &quot;μ&quot;, of the population from which the sample was drawn. Similarly, the sample variance (estimator), denoted &quot;S&quot;2, can be used to estimate the &quot;variance&quot; parameter (estimand), denoted &quot;σ&quot;2, of the population from which the sample was drawn. (Note that the sample standard deviation (&quot;S&quot;) is not an unbiased estimate of the population standard deviation (&quot;σ&quot;): see Unbiased estimation of standard deviation.)

It is possible to make statistical inferences without assuming a particular parametric family of probability distributions. In that case, one speaks of &quot;non-parametric statistics&quot; as opposed to the parametric statistics just described. For example, a test based on Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient would be called non-parametric since the statistic is computed from the rank-order of the data disregarding their actual values (and thus regardless of the distribution they were sampled from), whereas those based on the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient are parametric tests since it is computed directly from the data values and thus estimates the parameter known as the population correlation.

===Probability theory===
In probability theory, one may describe the distribution of a random variable as belonging to a &quot;family&quot; of probability distributions, distinguished from each other by the values of a finite number of &quot;parameters&quot;. For example, one talks about &quot;a Poisson distribution with mean value λ&quot;. The function defining the distribution (the probability mass function) is:
:formula_12
This example nicely illustrates the distinction between constants, parameters, and variables. &quot;e&quot; is Euler&#x27;s number, a fundamental mathematical constant. The parameter λ is the mean number of observations of some phenomenon in question, a property characteristic of the system. &quot;k&quot; is a variable, in this case the number of occurrences of the phenomenon actually observed from a particular sample. If we want to know the probability of observing &quot;k&quot;1 occurrences, we plug it into the function to get formula_13. Without altering the system, we can take multiple samples, which will have a range of values of &quot;k&quot;, but the system is always characterized by the same λ.

For instance, suppose we have a radioactive sample that emits, on average, five particles every ten minutes. We take measurements of how many particles the sample emits over ten-minute periods. The measurements exhibit different values of &quot;k&quot;, and if the sample behaves according to Poisson statistics, then each value of &quot;k&quot; will come up in a proportion given by the probability mass function above. From measurement to measurement, however, λ remains constant at 5. If we do not alter the system, then the parameter λ is unchanged from measurement to measurement; if, on the other hand, we modulate the system by replacing the sample with a more radioactive one, then the parameter λ would increase.

Another common distribution is the normal distribution, which has as parameters the mean μ and the variance σ².

In these above examples, the distributions of the random variables are completely specified by the type of distribution, i.e. Poisson or normal, and the parameter values, i.e. mean and variance. In such a case, we have a parameterized distribution.

It is possible to use the sequence of moments (mean, mean square, ...) or cumulants (mean, variance, ...) as parameters for a probability distribution: see Statistical parameter.

==Computer programming==

In computer programming, two notions of parameter are commonly used, and are referred to as parameters and arguments—or more formally as a formal parameter and an actual parameter.

For example, in the definition of a function such as
: y = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; + 2,
&quot;x&quot; is the &quot;formal parameter&quot; (the &quot;parameter&quot;) of the defined function.

When the function is evaluated for a given value, as in
:&quot;f&quot;(3): or, &quot;y&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(3) = 3 + 2 = 5,
3 is the &quot;actual parameter&quot; (the &quot;argument&quot;) for evaluation by the defined function; it is a given value (actual value) that is substituted for the &quot;formal parameter&quot; of the defined function. (In casual usage the terms &quot;parameter&quot; and &quot;argument&quot; might inadvertently be interchanged, and thereby used incorrectly.)

These concepts are discussed in a more precise way in functional programming and its foundational disciplines, lambda calculus and combinatory logic. Terminology varies between languages; some computer languages such as C define parameter and argument as given here, while Eiffel uses an alternative convention.

==Artificial intelligence==
In artificial intelligence, a model describes the probability that something will occur. Parameters in a model are the weight of the various probabilities. Tiernan Ray, in an article on GPT-3, described parameters this way: 

==Engineering==
In engineering (especially involving data acquisition) the term &quot;parameter&quot; sometimes loosely refers to an individual measured item. This usage is not consistent, as sometimes the term &quot;channel&quot; refers to an individual measured item, with &quot;parameter&quot; referring to the setup information about that channel.

&quot;Speaking generally, properties are those physical quantities which directly describe the physical attributes of the system; parameters are those combinations of the properties which suffice to determine the response of the system. Properties can have all sorts of dimensions, depending upon the system being considered; parameters are dimensionless, or have the dimension of time or its reciprocal.&quot;

The term can also be used in engineering contexts, however, as it is typically used in the physical sciences.

==Environmental science==
In environmental science and particularly in chemistry and microbiology, a parameter is used to describe a discrete chemical or microbiological entity that can be assigned a value: commonly a concentration, but may also be a logical entity (present or absent), a statistical result such as a 95 percentile value or in some cases a subjective value.

==Linguistics==
Within linguistics, the word &quot;parameter&quot; is almost exclusively used to denote a binary switch in a Universal Grammar within a Principles and Parameters framework.

==Logic==
In logic, the parameters passed to (or operated on by) an &quot;open predicate&quot; are called &quot;parameters&quot; by some authors (e.g., Prawitz&#x27;s &quot;Natural Deduction&quot;; Paulson&#x27;s &quot;Designing a theorem prover&quot;). Parameters locally defined within the predicate are called &quot;variables&quot;. This extra distinction pays off when defining substitution (without this distinction special provision must be made to avoid variable capture). Others (maybe most) just call parameters passed to (or operated on by) an open predicate &quot;variables&quot;, and when defining substitution have to distinguish between &quot;free variables&quot; and &quot;bound variables&quot;.

==Music==

In music theory, a parameter denotes an element which may be manipulated (composed), separately from the other elements. The term is used particularly for pitch, loudness, duration, and timbre, though theorists or composers have sometimes considered other musical aspects as parameters. The term is particularly used in serial music, where each parameter may follow some specified series. Paul Lansky and George Perle criticized the extension of the word &quot;parameter&quot; to this sense, since it is not closely related to its mathematical sense, but it remains common. The term is also common in music production, as the functions of audio processing units (such as the attack, release, ratio, threshold, and other variables on a compressor) are defined by parameters specific to the type of unit (compressor, equalizer, delay, etc.).

<doc id="25071" wikidata="Q101942" url="?curid=25071" title="Paavo Nurmi">
<text>Paavo Johannes Nurmi (; 13 June 1897 – 2 October 1973) was a Finnish middle-distance and long-distance runner. He was called the &quot;Flying Finn&quot; because he dominated distance running in the 1920s. Nurmi set 22 official world records at distances between 1,500 metres and 20 kilometres, and won nine gold and three silver medals in his 12 events in the Summer Olympic Games. At his peak, Nurmi was undefeated for 121 races at distances from 800 m upwards. Throughout his 14-year career, he remained unbeaten in cross country events and the 10,000 metres.

Born into a working-class family, Nurmi left school at the age of 12 to provide for his family. In 1912, he was inspired by the Olympic feats of Hannes Kolehmainen and began developing a strict training program. Nurmi started to flourish during his military service, setting Finnish records in athletics en route to his international debut at the 1920 Summer Olympics. After winning a silver medal in the 5,000 m, he won gold in the 10,000 m and the cross country events. In 1923, Nurmi became the first runner to hold simultaneous world records in the mile, the 5,000 m and the 10,000 m races, a feat which has never been repeated. He set new world records for the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m with just an hour between the races, and took gold medals in both distances in less than two hours at the 1924 Summer Olympics. Seemingly unaffected by the Paris heat wave, Nurmi won all his races and returned home with five gold medals, although he was frustrated that Finnish officials had refused to enter him for the 10,000 m.

Struggling with injuries and motivation issues after his exhaustive U.S. tour in 1925, Nurmi found his long-time rivals compatriot Ville Ritola and Sweden&#x27;s Edvin Wide ever more serious challengers. At the 1928 Summer Olympics, Nurmi recaptured the 10,000 m title but was beaten for the gold in the 5,000 m and the 3,000 m steeplechase. He then turned his attention to longer distances, breaking the world records for events such as the one hour run and the 25-mile marathon. Nurmi intended to end his career with a marathon gold medal, as his idol Kolehmainen had done. In a controversial case that strained Finland–Sweden relations and sparked an inter-IAAF battle, Nurmi was suspended before the 1932 Games by an IAAF council that questioned his amateur status; two days before the opening ceremonies, the council rejected his entries. Although he was never declared a professional, Nurmi&#x27;s suspension became definite in 1934 and he retired from running.

Nurmi later coached Finnish runners, raised funds for Finland during the Winter War, and worked as a haberdasher, building contractor, and stock trader, becoming one of the richest people in Finland. In 1952, he was the lighter of the Olympic Flame at the Summer Olympics in Helsinki. Nurmi&#x27;s running speed and elusive personality spawned nicknames such as the &quot;Phantom Finn&quot;, while his achievements, training methods and running style influenced future generations of middle- and long-distance runners. Nurmi, who rarely ran without a stopwatch in his hand, has been credited with introducing the &quot;even pace&quot; strategy and analytic approach to running, and for making running a major international sport.

==Early life==

Nurmi was born in Turku, Finland, to carpenter Johan Fredrik Nurmi and his wife Matilda Wilhelmiina Laine. Nurmi&#x27;s siblings, Siiri, Saara, Martti and Lahja, were born in 1898, 1902, 1905 and 1908, respectively. In 1903, the Nurmi family moved from Raunistula into a 40-square-meter apartment in central Turku, where Paavo Nurmi would live until 1932. The young Nurmi and his friends were inspired by the English long-distance runner Alfred Shrubb. They regularly ran or walked six kilometres (four miles) to swim in Ruissalo, and back, sometimes twice a day. By the age of eleven, Nurmi ran the 1500 metres in 5:02. Nurmi&#x27;s father Johan died in 1910 and his sister Lahja a year later. The family struggled financially, renting out their kitchen to another family and living in a single room. Nurmi, a talented student, left school to work as an errand boy for a bakery. Although he stopped running actively, he got plenty of exercise pushing heavy carts up the steep slopes in Turku. He later credited these climbs for strengthening his back and leg muscles.

At 15, Nurmi rekindled his interest in athletics after being inspired by the performances of Hannes Kolehmainen, who was said to &quot;have run Finland onto the map of the world&quot; at the 1912 Summer Olympics. He bought his first pair of sneakers a few days later. Nurmi trained primarily by doing cross country running in the summers and cross country skiing in the winters. In 1914, Nurmi joined the sports club Turun Urheiluliitto and won his first race on the 3000 metres. Two years later, he revised his training program to include walking, sprints and calisthenics. He continued to provide for his family through his new job at the Ab. H. Ahlberg &amp; Co workshop in Turku, where he worked until he started his military service at a machine gun company in the Pori Brigade in April 1919. During the Finnish Civil War in 1918, Nurmi remained politically passive and concentrated on his work and his Olympic ambitions. After the war, he decided not to join the newly founded Finnish Workers&#x27; Sports Federation, but wrote articles for the federation&#x27;s chief organ and criticized the discrimination against many of his fellow workers and athletes.
In the army, Nurmi quickly impressed in the athletic competitions: While others marched, Nurmi ran the whole distances with a rifle on his shoulder and a backpack full of sand. Nurmi&#x27;s stubbornness caused him difficulties with his non-commissioned officers, but he was favoured by the superior officers, despite his refusal to take the military oath even at the threat of a court-martial. As the unit commander Hugo Österman was a known sports aficionado, Nurmi and a few other athletes were given free time to practice. Nurmi improvised new training methods in the army barracks; he ran behind trains, holding on to the rear bumper, to stretch his stride, and used heavy iron-clad army boots to strengthen his legs. Nurmi soon began setting personal bests and got close for the Olympic selection. In March 1920, he was promoted to corporal (&quot;alikersantti&quot;). On 29 May 1920, he set his first national record in 3,000 m and went on to win the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m at the Olympic trials in July.

==Olympic career==

===1920–1924 Olympics===

Nurmi made his international debut in August at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. He took his first medal by finishing second to Frenchman Joseph Guillemot in the 5000 m. This would remain the only time that Nurmi lost to a non-Finnish runner in the Olympics. He went on to win gold medals in his other three events: the 10,000 m, sprinting past Guillemot on the final curve and improving his personal best by over a minute, the cross country race, beating Sweden&#x27;s Eric Backman, and the cross country team event where he helped Heikki Liimatainen and Teodor Koskenniemi defeat the British and Swedish teams. Nurmi&#x27;s success brought electric lighting and running water for his family in Turku. Nurmi, however, was given a scholarship to study at the Teollisuuskoulu industrial school in Helsinki.

Buoyed by his defeat to Guillemot, Nurmi&#x27;s races became a series of experiments which he analyzed meticulously. Previously known for his blistering pace on the first few laps, Nurmi started to carry a stopwatch and spread his efforts more uniformly over the distance. He aimed to perfect his technique and tactics to a point where the performances of his rivals would be rendered meaningless. Nurmi set his first world record on the 10,000 m in Stockholm in 1921. In 1922, he broke the world records for the 2000 m, the 3000 m and the 5000 m. A year later, Nurmi added the records for the 1500 m and the mile. His feat of holding the world records for the mile, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m at the same time has not been matched by any other athlete before or since. Nurmi also tested his speed in the 800 m, winning the 1923 Finnish Championships with a new national record. After excelling in mathematics, Nurmi graduated as an engineer in 1923 and returned home to prepare for the upcoming Olympic Games.

Nurmi&#x27;s trip to the 1924 Summer Olympics was endangered by a knee injury in the spring of 1924, but he recovered and resumed training twice a day. On 19 June, Nurmi tried out the 1924 Olympic schedule at the Eläintarha Stadium in Helsinki by running the 1500 m and the 5000 m inside an hour, setting new world records for both distances. In the 1500 m final at the Olympics in Paris, Nurmi ran the first 800 m almost three seconds faster. His only challenger, Ray Watson of the United States, gave up before the last lap and Nurmi was able to slow down and coast to victory ahead of Willy Schärer, H. B. Stallard and Douglas Lowe, still breaking the Olympic record by three seconds. The 5000 m final started in less than two hours, and Nurmi faced a tough challenge from countryman Ville Ritola, who had already won the 3000 m steeplechase and the 10,000 m. Ritola and Edvin Wide figured that Nurmi must be tired and tried to burn him off by running at world-record pace. Realizing that he was now racing the two men and not the clock, Nurmi tossed his stopwatch onto the grass. The Finns later passed the Swede as his pace faded and continued their duel. On the home straight, Ritola sprinted from the outside but Nurmi increased his pace to keep his rival a metre behind.

In the cross country events, the heat of , caused all but 15 of the 38 competitors to abandon the race. Eight finishers were taken away on stretchers. One athlete began to run in tiny circles after reaching the stadium, until setting off into the stands and knocking himself unconscious. Early leader Wide was among those who blacked out along the course, and was incorrectly reported to have died at the hospital. Nurmi exhibited only slight signs of exhaustion after beating Ritola to the win by nearly a minute and a half. As Finland looked to have lost the team medal, the disoriented Liimatainen staggered into the stadium, but was barely moving forward. An athlete ahead of him fainted 50 metres from the finish, and Liimatainen stopped and tried to find his way off the track, thinking he had reached the finish line. After having ignored shouts and kept the spectators in suspense for a while, he turned into the right direction, realised his situation and reached the finish in 12th place and secured team gold. Those present at the stadium were shocked by what they had witnessed, and Olympic officials decided to ban cross country running from future Games.

In the 3000 m team race on the next day, Nurmi and Ritola again finished first and second, and Elias Katz secured the gold medal for the Finnish team by finishing fifth. Nurmi had won five gold medals in five events, but he left the Games embittered as the Finnish officials had allocated races between their star runners and prevented him from defending his title in the 10,000 m, the distance that was dearest to him. After returning to Finland, Nurmi set a 10,000 m world record that would last for almost 13 years. As of July 2024, this is the second-longest-standing world record for the men&#x27;s 10,000 metres. Kenenia Bekele&#x27;s world record set in August 2005 in Brussels stood for over 15 years. Nurmi now held the 1500 metres, the mile, the 3,000 metres, the 5,000 metres and the 10,000 metres world records simultaneously.

===U.S. tour and 1928 Olympics===

In early 1925, Nurmi embarked on a widely publicised tour of the United States. He competed in 55 events (45 indoors) during a five-month period, starting at a sold-out Madison Square Garden on 6 January. His debut was a copy of his feats in Helsinki and Paris. Nurmi defeated Joie Ray and Lloyd Hahn to win the mile and Ritola to win the 5000 m, again setting new world records for both distances. Nurmi broke ten more indoor world records in regular events and set several new best times for rarer distances. He won 51 of the events, abandoned one race and lost two handicap races along with his final event; a half-mile race at the Yankee Stadium, where he finished second to American track star Alan Helffrich. Helffrich&#x27;s victory ended Nurmi&#x27;s 121-race, four-year win streak in individual scratch races at distances from 800 m upwards. Although he hated losing more than anything, Nurmi was the first to congratulate Helffrich. The tour made Nurmi extremely popular in the United States, and the Finn agreed to meet President Calvin Coolidge at the White House. Nurmi left America fearing that he had competed too often and burned himself out.

Nurmi struggled to maintain motivation for running, heightened by his rheumatism and Achilles tendon problems. He quit his job as a machinery draughtsman in 1926 and began studying business intensively. As Nurmi started a new career as a share dealer, his financial advisors included Risto Ryti, director of the Bank of Finland. In 1926, Nurmi broke Wide&#x27;s world record for the 3000 m in Berlin and then improved the record in Stockholm, despite Nils Eklöf repeatedly trying to slow his pace down in an effort to aid Wide. Nurmi was furious at the Swedes and vowed never to race Eklöf again. In October 1926, he lost a 1500 m race along with his world record to Germany&#x27;s Otto Peltzer. This marked the first time in over five years and 133 races that Nurmi had been defeated at a distance over 1000 m. In 1927, Finnish officials barred him from international competition for refusing to run against Eklöf at the Finland-Sweden international, cancelling the Peltzer rematch scheduled for Vienna. Nurmi ended his season and threatened, until late November, to withdraw from the 1928 Summer Olympics. At the 1928 Olympic trials, Nurmi was left third in the 1500 m by eventual gold and bronze medalists Harri Larva and Eino Purje, and he decided to concentrate on the longer distances. He added steeplechase to his program, although he had only tried the event twice before, the latest being a two-mile steeplechase victory at the 1922 British Championships.

At the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, Nurmi competed in three events. He won the 10,000 m by staying right behind Ritola until sprinting past him on the home straight. Before the 5000 m final, Nurmi injured himself in his qualifying heat for the 3000 m steeplechase. He fell on his back at the water jump, spraining his hip and foot. Lucien Duquesne stopped to help him up, and Nurmi thanked the Frenchman by pacing him past the field and offered him the heat win, which Duquesne gracefully refused. In the 5000 m, Nurmi tried to repeat his move on Ritola but had to watch his teammate pull away instead. Nurmi, looking more exhausted than ever before, only barely managed to keep Wide behind and take silver. Nurmi had little time to rest or nurse his injuries as the 3000 m steeplechase started the next day. Struggling with the hurdles, Nurmi let Finland&#x27;s steeplechase specialist Toivo Loukola escape into the distance. On the final lap, he sprinted clear of the others and finished nine seconds behind the world-record setting Loukola; Nurmi&#x27;s time also bettered the previous record. Although Ritola did not finish, Ove Andersen completed a Finnish sweep of the medals.

===Move to longer distances===

Nurmi stated to a Swedish newspaper that &quot;this is absolutely my last season on the track. I am beginning to get old. I have raced for fifteen years and have had enough of it.&quot; However, Nurmi continued running, turning his attention to longer distances. In October, he broke the world records for the 15 km, the 10 miles and the one hour run in Berlin. Nurmi&#x27;s one-hour record stood for 17 years, until Viljo Heino ran 129 metres further in 1945. In January 1929, Nurmi started his second U.S. tour from Brooklyn. He suffered his first-ever defeat in the mile to Ray Conger at the indoor Wanamaker Mile. Nurmi was seven seconds slower than in his world record run in 1925, and it was immediately speculated if the mile had become too short a distance for him. In 1930, he set a new world record for the 20 km. In July 1931, Nurmi showed he still had pace for the shorter distances by beating Lauri Lehtinen, Lauri Virtanen and Volmari Iso-Hollo, and breaking the world record on the now-rare two miles. He was the first runner to complete the distance in less than nine minutes. Nurmi planned to compete only in the 10,000 m and the marathon in the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, stating that he &quot;won&#x27;t enter the 5000 metres for Finland has at least three excellent men for that event.&quot;

In April 1932, the executive council of the International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF) suspended Nurmi from international athletics events pending an investigation into his amateur status by the Finnish Athletics Federation. The Finnish authorities criticized the IAAF for acting without a hearing, but agreed to launch an investigation. It was customary of the IAAF to accept the final decision of its national branch, and the Associated Press wrote that &quot;there is little doubt that if the Finnish federation clears Nurmi the international body will accept its decision without question.&quot; A week later, the Finnish Athletics Federation ruled in favor of Nurmi, finding no evidence for the allegations of professionalism. Nurmi was hopeful that his suspension would be lifted in time for the Games.
On 26 June 1932 Nurmi started his first marathon at the Olympic trials. Not drinking a drop of liquid, he ran the old-style &#x27;short marathon&#x27; of in 2:22:03.8 – on the pace to finish in about 2:29:00, just under Albert Michelsen&#x27;s marathon world record of 2:29:01.8. At the time, he led Armas Toivonen, the eventual Olympic bronze medalist, by six minutes. Nurmi&#x27;s time was the new unofficial world record for the short marathon. Confident that he had done enough, Nurmi stopped and retired from the race owing to problems with his Achilles tendon. The Finnish Olympic Committee entered Nurmi for both the 10,000 m and the marathon. &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that &quot;some of his trial times were almost unbelievable,&quot; and Nurmi went on to train at the Olympic Village in Los Angeles despite his injury. Nurmi had set his heart on ending his career with a marathon gold medal, as Kolehmainen had done shortly after the First World War.

===1932 Olympics and later career===
Less than three days before the 10,000 m, a special commission of the IAAF, consisting of the same seven members that had suspended Nurmi, rejected the Finn&#x27;s entries and barred him from competing in Los Angeles. Sigfrid Edström, the Swedish chairman of the Council of the International Association of Athletics Federations (s.o. the board of directors), pushed independently and without receiving the support of the rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations for a decision to ban Nurmi from participating in the Los Angeles Olympics at the IAAF board meeting without consulting the Finnish Sports Federation (SUL) and Nurmi on 3.4. and 7/30/1932. [The rules for disqualification of an athlete were made only after the Olympics at the Congress (General Assembly) of the International Sports Federation (IAAF), where Edström and Bo Ekelund, secretary of the council, represented Sweden. The report for Nurmi&#x27;s ban came from Avery Brundage, president of the American Sports Federation.]
Edström stated that the full congress of the IAAF, which was scheduled to start the next day, could not reinstate Nurmi for the Olympics but merely review the phases and political angles related to the case. The AP called this &quot;one of the slickest political maneuvers in international athletic history&quot;, and wrote that the Games would now be &quot;like Hamlet without the celebrated Dane in the cast.&quot; Thousands protested against the action in Helsinki. Details of the case were not released to the press, but the evidence against Nurmi was believed be the sworn statements from German race promoters that Nurmi had received $250–500 per race when running in Germany in autumn 1931. The statements were produced by Karl Ritter von Halt, after Edström had sent him increasingly threatening letters warning that if evidence against Nurmi were not provided he would be &quot;unfortunately obliged to take stringent action against the German Athletics Association.&quot; The IOC did not follow their own rules for disqualification for not being a non-amateur Olympic participant. The rulebook for the 1912 Olympics stated that protests had to be made &quot;within 30 days from the closing ceremonies of the games.&quot;

On the eve of the marathon, all the entrants of the race except for the Finns, whose positions were known, filed a petition asking Nurmi&#x27;s entry to be accepted. Edström&#x27;s right-hand man Bo Ekelund, secretary general of the IAAF and head of the Swedish Athletics Federation, approached the Finnish officials and stated that he might be able to arrange for Nurmi to participate in the marathon outside the competition. However, Finland maintained that as long as the athlete is not declared a professional, he must have the right to participate in the race officially. Although he had been diagnosed with a pulled Achilles tendon two weeks earlier, Nurmi stated he would have won the event by five minutes. The congress concluded without Nurmi being declared a professional, but the council&#x27;s authority to disbar an athlete was upheld on a 13–12 vote. However, due to the close vote, the matter was postponed until the 1934 meet in Stockholm. Finns charged that the Swedish officials had used devious tricks in their campaign against Nurmi&#x27;s amateur status, and ceased all athletic relations with Sweden. A year earlier, controversies on the track and in the press had led Finland to withdraw from the Finland-Sweden athletics international. After Nurmi&#x27;s suspension, Finland did not agree to return to the event until 1939.

Nurmi refused to turn professional, and continued running as an amateur in Finland. In 1933, he ran his first 1500 m in three years and won the national title with his best time since 1926. At the IAAF meet in August 1934, Finland launched two proposals that lost. The council then brought forward its resolution empowering it to suspend athletes that it finds in violation of the IAAF amateur code. With a 12–5 vote, with many not voting, Nurmi&#x27;s suspension from international amateur athletics became definite. Less than three weeks later, Nurmi retired from running with a 10,000 m victory in Viipuri on 16 September 1934. Nurmi remained undefeated in the distance throughout his 14-year top-level career. In cross country running, his win streak lasted 19 years.

==Later life==

While active as a runner, Nurmi was known to be secretive about his training methods. Always running alone, he upped his pace and quickly exhausted anyone who was bold enough to join him. Even his club mate Harri Larva had learned little from him. After ending his career, Nurmi became a coach for the Finnish Athletics Federation and trained runners for the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. In 1935, Nurmi along with the entire board of directors quit the federation after a heated 40–38 vote to resume athletic relations with Sweden. However, Nurmi returned to coaching three months later and the Finnish distance runners went on to take three gold medals, three silvers and a bronze at the Games. In 1936, Nurmi also opened a men&#x27;s clothing store (haberdashery) in Helsinki. It became a popular tourist attraction, and Emil Zátopek was among those who visited the store trying to meet Nurmi. The Finn spent his time in the back room, running another new business venture; construction. As a contractor, Nurmi built forty apartment buildings in Helsinki with about a hundred flats in each. Within five years, he was rated a millionaire. His fiercest rival Ritola ended up living in one of Nurmi&#x27;s flats, at half price. Nurmi also made money on the stock market, eventually becoming one of Finland&#x27;s richest people.

In February 1940, during the Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union, Nurmi returned to the United States with his protégé Taisto Mäki, who had become the first man to run the 10,000 m under 30 minutes, to raise funds and rally support to the Finnish cause. The relief drive, directed by former president Herbert Hoover, included a coast-to-coast tour by Nurmi and Mäki. Hoover welcomed the two as &quot;ambassadors of the greatest sporting nation in the world.&quot; While in San Francisco, Nurmi received news that one of his apprentices, 1936 Olympic champion Gunnar Höckert, had been killed in action. Nurmi left for Finland in late April, and later served in the Continuation War in a delivery company and as a trainer in the military staff. Before he was discharged in January 1942, Nurmi was promoted first to a staff sergeant (&quot;ylikersantti&quot;) and later to a sergeant first class (&quot;vääpeli&quot;).
In 1952, Nurmi was persuaded by Urho Kekkonen, Prime Minister of Finland and former chairman of the Finnish Athletics Federation, to carry the Olympic torch into the Olympic Stadium at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki. His appearance astonished the spectators, and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; wrote that &quot;his celebrated stride was unmistakable to the crowd. When he came into view, waves of sound began to build throughout the stadium, rising to a roar, then to a thunder. When the national teams, assembled in formation on the infield, saw the flowing figure of Nurmi, they broke ranks like excited schoolchildren, dashing toward the edge of the track.&quot; After lighting the flame in the Olympic Cauldron, Nurmi passed the torch to his idol Kolehmainen, who lighted the beacon in the tower. In the cancelled 1940 Summer Olympics, Nurmi had been planned to lead a group of fifty Finnish gold medal winners.

Nurmi felt that he got too much credit as an athlete and too little as a businessman, but his interest in running never died. He even returned to the track himself a few times. In 1946, he faced his old rival Edvin Wide in Stockholm in a benefit for the victims of the Greek Civil War. Nurmi ran for the last time on 18 February 1966 at the Madison Square Garden, invited by the New York Athletic Club. In 1962, Nurmi predicted that wealthier countries would start to struggle in the distance events: &quot;The higher the standard of living in a country, the weaker the results often are in the events which call for work and trouble. I would like to warn this new generation: &#x27;Do not let this comfortable life make you lazy. Do not let the new means of transport kill your instinct for physical exercise. Too many young people get used to driving in a car even for small distances.&#x27;&quot; In 1966, he took the microphone in front of 300 sports club guests and criticised the state of distance running in Finland, reproaching the sports executives as publicity seekers and tourists, and demanding athletes sacrifice everything to accomplish something. Nurmi lived to see the renaissance of Finnish running in the 1970s, led by athletes such as the 1972 Olympic gold medalists Lasse Virén and Pekka Vasala. He had complimented the running style of Virén, and advised Vasala to concentrate on Kipchoge Keino.
Although he accepted an invitation from President Lyndon B. Johnson to revisit the White House in 1964, Nurmi lived a very secluded life until the late 1960s when he began granting some press interviews. On his 70th birthday, Nurmi agreed to an interview for Yle, Finland&#x27;s national public-broadcasting company, only after learning that President Kekkonen would act as the interviewer. Suffering from health problems, with at least one heart attack, a stroke and failing eyesight, Nurmi at times spoke bitterly about sports, calling it a waste of time compared to science and art. He died in 1973 in Helsinki and was given a state funeral. Kekkonen attended the funeral and praised Nurmi: &quot;People explore the horizons for a successor. But none comes and none will, for his class is extinguished with him.&quot; At the request of Nurmi, who enjoyed classical music and played the violin, Konsta Jylhä&#x27;s &quot;Vaiennut viulu&quot; (&quot;The Silenced Violin&quot;) was played during the ceremony. Nurmi&#x27;s last record fell in 1996; his 1925 world record for the indoor 2000 m lasted as the Finnish national record for 71 years.

==Personal life and public image==

Nurmi was married to socialite Sylvi Laaksonen (1907–1968) from 1932 to 1935. Laaksonen, who was not interested in athletics, opposed Nurmi raising their newborn son Matti to be a runner and stated to the Associated Press in 1933, &quot;[H]is concentration on athletics at last forced me to go to the judge for a divorce.&quot; Matti Nurmi did become a middle-distance runner, and later a &quot;self-made&quot; businessman. Nurmi&#x27;s relationship with his son was termed &quot;uneasy&quot;. Matti admired his father more as a businessman than as an athlete, and the two never discussed his running career. As a runner, Matti was at his best in the 3000 m, where he equalled his father&#x27;s time. In the famous race on 11 July 1957 when the &quot;three Olavis&quot; (Salsola, Salonen and Vuorisalo) broke the world record for the 1500 m, Matti Nurmi finished a distant ninth with his personal best, 2.2 seconds slower than his father&#x27;s world record from 1924. Hollywood actress Maila Nurmi, best known as the horror icon &quot;Vampira&quot;, was often referred to as Paavo Nurmi&#x27;s niece. However, the kinship is not supported by official documents.

Nurmi enjoyed the Finnish sports massage and sauna-bathing traditions, crediting the Finnish sauna for his performances during the Paris heat wave in 1924. He had a versatile diet, although he had practiced vegetarianism between the ages of 15 and 21. Nurmi, who identified as neurasthenic, was known to be &quot;taciturn&quot;, &quot;stony-faced&quot; and &quot;stubborn&quot;. He was not believed to have had any close friends, but he had occasionally socialized and showed his &quot;sarcastic sense of humour&quot; among the small circles he knew. Acclaimed the biggest sporting figure in the world at his peak, Nurmi was averse to publicity and the media, stating later on his 75th birthday, &quot;[W]orldly fame and reputation are worth less than a rotten lingonberry.&quot; French journalist Gabriel Hanot questioned Nurmi&#x27;s intensive approach to sports and wrote in 1924 that Nurmi &quot;is ever more serious, reserved, concentrated, pessimistic, fanatic. There is such coldness in him and his self-control is so great that never for a moment does he show his feelings.&quot; Some contemporary Finns nicknamed him &quot;Suuri vaikenija&quot; (The Great Silent One), and Ron Clarke noted that Nurmi&#x27;s persona remained a mystery even to Finnish runners and journalists: &quot;Even to them, he was never quite real. He was enigmatic, sphinx-like, a god in a cloud. It was as if he was all the time playing a role in a drama.&quot;

Nurmi was more responsive to his fellow athletes than to the media. He exchanged ideas with sprinter Charley Paddock and even trained with his rival Otto Peltzer. Nurmi told Peltzer to forget his opponents: &quot;Conquering yourself is the greatest challenge of an athlete.&quot; Nurmi was known to emphasize the importance of psychological strength: &quot;Mind is everything; muscle, pieces of rubber. All that I am, I am because of my mind.&quot; Regarding Nurmi&#x27;s track antics, Peltzer found that &quot;in his impenetrability he was a Buddha gliding on the track. Stopwatch in hand, lap after lap, he ran towards the tape, subject only to the laws of a mathematical table.&quot; Marathoner Johnny Kelley, who first met his idol at the 1936 Olympics, said that while Nurmi appeared cold to him at first, the two chatted for quite a while after Nurmi had asked for his name: &quot;He grabbed ahold of me — he was so excited. I couldn&#x27;t believe it!&quot;

Nurmi&#x27;s speed and elusive personality led to nicknames such as the &quot;Phantom Finn&quot;, the &quot;King of Runners&quot; and &quot;Peerless Paavo&quot;, while his mathematical prowess and use of a stopwatch led the press to characterize him as a running machine. One newspaperman dubbed Nurmi &quot;a mechanical Frankenstein created to annihilate time.&quot; Phil Cousineau noted that &quot;his own innovation — the tactic of pacing himself with a stopwatch — both inspired and troubled people in an era when the robot was becoming symbolic of the modern soulless human being.&quot; Among the popular newspaper rumours about Nurmi was that he had a &quot;freakish heart&quot; with a very low pulse rate. During the debate over his amateur status, Nurmi was joked to have &quot;the lowest heartbeat and the highest asking price of any athlete in the world.&quot;

==Legacy==

Nurmi broke 22 official world records on distances between 1500 m and 20 km; a record in running. He also set many more unofficial ones for a total of 58. His indoor world records were all unofficial as the IAAF did not ratify indoor records until the 1980s. Nurmi&#x27;s record for most Olympic gold medals was matched by gymnast Larisa Latynina in 1964, swimmer Mark Spitz in 1972 and fellow track and field athlete Carl Lewis in 1996, and broken by swimmer Michael Phelps in 2008. Nurmi&#x27;s record for most medals in the Olympic Games stood until Edoardo Mangiarotti won his 13th medal in fencing in 1960. &quot;Time&quot; selected Nurmi as the greatest Olympian of all time in 1996, and IAAF named him among the first twelve athletes to be inducted into the IAAF Hall of Fame in 2012.

Nurmi introduced the &quot;even pace&quot; strategy to running, pacing himself with a stopwatch and spreading his energy uniformly over the race. He reasoned that &quot;when you race against time, you don&#x27;t have to sprint. Others can&#x27;t hold the pace if it is steady and hard all through to the tape.&quot; Archie Macpherson stated that &quot;with the stopwatch always in his hand, he elevated athletics to a new plane of intelligent application of effort and was the harbinger of the modern scientifically prepared athlete.&quot; Nurmi was considered a pioneer also in regards to training; he developed a systematic all-year-round training program that included both long-distance work and interval running. Peter Lovesey wrote in &quot;The Kings of Distance: A Study of Five Great Runners&quot; that Nurmi &quot;accelerated the progress of world records; developed and actually came to personify the analytic approach to running; and he was a profound influence not only in Finland, but throughout the world of athletics. Nurmi, his style, technique and tactics were held to be infallible, and really seemed so, as successive imitators in Finland steadily improved the records.&quot; Cordner Nelson, founder of &quot;Track &amp; Field News&quot;, credited Nurmi for popularizing running as a spectator sport: &quot;His imprint on the track world was greater than any man’s before or after. He, more than any man, raised track to the glory of a major sport in the eyes of international fans, and they honored him as one of the truly great athletes of all sports.&quot;

Nurmi&#x27;s achievements and training methods inspired future generations of track stars. Emil Zátopek chanted &quot;I am Nurmi! I am Nurmi!&quot; when he trained as a child, and based his training system on what he was able to find out about Nurmi&#x27;s methods. Lasse Virén idolized Nurmi and was scheduled to meet him for the first time on the day that Nurmi died. Hicham El Guerrouj was inspired to become a runner so that he could &quot;repeat the achievements of the great man of whom his grandfather spoke.&quot; He became the first man after Nurmi to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the same Games. Nurmi&#x27;s influence stretched further than running on the Olympic arena. At the 1928 Olympics, Kazimierz Wierzyński won the lyric gold medal with his poem &quot;Olympic Laurel&quot; that included a verse on Nurmi. In 1936, Ludwig Stubbendorf and his horse &quot;Nurmi&quot; won the individual and team gold medals in eventing.
A bronze statue of Nurmi was sculpted by Wäinö Aaltonen in 1925. The original is held at the art museum Ateneum, but copies cast from the original mould exist in Turku, in Jyväskylä, in front of the Helsinki Olympic Stadium and at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. In a widely publicized prank by the students of the Helsinki University of Technology, a miniature copy of the statue was discovered from the 300-year-old wreck of the Swedish war ship &quot;Vasa&quot; when it was lifted from the bottom of the sea in 1961. Statues of Nurmi were also sculpted by Renée Sintenis in 1926 and by Carl Eldh, whose 1937 work &quot;Löpare&quot; (&quot;Runners&quot;) depicts a battle between Nurmi and Edvin Wide. &quot;Boken om Nurmi&quot; (&quot;The Book about Nurmi&quot;), released in Sweden in 1925, was the first biographical book on a Finnish sportsman. Finnish astronomer Yrjö Väisälä named the main belt asteroid 1740 Paavo Nurmi after Nurmi in 1939, while Finnair named its first DC-8 &quot;Paavo Nurmi&quot; in 1969. Nurmi&#x27;s former rival Ville Ritola boarded the plane when he moved back to Finland in 1970.

Paavo Nurmi Marathon, held annually since 1969, is the oldest marathon in Wisconsin and the second-oldest in the American Midwest. In Finland, another marathon bearing the name has been held in Nurmi&#x27;s hometown of Turku since 1992, along with the athletics competition Paavo Nurmi Games that was started in 1957. Finlandia University, an American college with Finnish roots, named their athletic center after Nurmi. A ten-mark bill featuring a portrait of Nurmi was issued by the Bank of Finland in 1987. The other revised bills honored architect Alvar Aalto, composer Jean Sibelius, Enlightenment thinker Anders Chydenius and author Elias Lönnrot, respectively. The Nurmi bill was replaced by a new 20-mark note featuring Väinö Linna in 1993. In 1997, a historic stadium in Turku was renamed the &quot;Paavo Nurmi Stadium&quot;. Twenty world records have been set at the stadium, including John Landy&#x27;s records on the 1500 m and the mile, Nurmi&#x27;s record on the 3000 m and Zátopek&#x27;s record on the 10,000 m. In fiction, Nurmi appears in William Goldman&#x27;s 1974 novel &quot;Marathon Man&quot; as the idol of the protagonist, who aims to become a greater runner than Nurmi. The opera on Nurmi, &quot;Paavo the Great. Great Race. Great Dream.&quot;, written by Paavo Haavikko and composed by Tuomas Kantelinen, debuted at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium in 2000. In a 2005 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, Mr. Burns brags that he once outraced Nurmi in his antique motorcar. The NURMI Study, which aims to compare the athletic performance of vegetarian and vegan athletes to those with omnivorous diets, is named in honour of Paavo Nurmi.
