<text>Pope Pius XII (born Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli, ; 2 March 18769 October 1958) was head of the Catholic Church and sovereign of the Vatican City State from 2 March 1939 until his death in October 1958. Before his election to the papacy, he served as secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, papal nuncio to Germany, and Cardinal Secretary of State, in which capacity he worked to conclude treaties with various European and Latin American nations, including the &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; treaty with the German Reich.

While the Vatican was officially neutral during World War II, the &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; and his leadership of the Catholic Church during the war remain the subject of controversy—including allegations of public silence and inaction concerning the fate of the Jews. Pius employed diplomacy to aid the victims of the Nazis during the war and, through directing the church to provide discreet aid to Jews and others, saved thousands of lives. Pius maintained links to the German resistance, and shared intelligence with the Allies. His strongest public condemnation of genocide was considered inadequate by the Allied Powers, while the Nazis viewed him as an Allied sympathizer who had dishonoured his policy of Vatican neutrality.

During his papacy, the Catholic Church issued the Decree against Communism, declaring that Catholics who profess the atheistic and materialist doctrines of communism are to be excommunicated as apostates from the Christian faith. The church experienced severe persecution and mass deportations of Catholic clergy in the Eastern Bloc. Despite all this, Stalin himself was still open to coordinating with Pius XII on the struggle against persecution of the Catholic church. He explicitly invoked &quot;ex cathedra&quot; papal infallibility with the dogma of the Assumption of Mary in his Apostolic constitution . His forty-one encyclicals include &quot;Mystici Corporis Christi&quot;, on the Church as the Mystical Body of Christ; &quot;Mediator Dei&quot; on liturgy reform; and &quot;Humani generis&quot;, in which he instructed theologians to adhere to episcopal teaching and allowed that the human body might have evolved from earlier forms. He eliminated the Italian majority in the College of Cardinals in 1946.

After he died in 1958, Pope Pius XII was succeeded by John XXIII. In the process toward sainthood, his cause for canonization was opened on 18 November 1965 by Paul VI during the final session of the Second Vatican Council. He was made a Servant of God by John Paul II in 1990 and Benedict XVI declared Pius XII Venerable on 19 December 2009. Pacelli remains the last pope to take the regnal name of Pius to the present day.

The opening of the Vatican archives provides new insights into Pope Pius XII and his handling of the Holocaust. The disclosed documents suggest that the Pope knowingly withheld information about the persecution of Jews between 1942 and 1945. Historian David Israel Kertzer also points to a secret blackmail attempt by the Nazis: The Vatican was to be made an offer in which ongoing proceedings against priests for child abuse in Germany would be dropped if the Church remained politically neutral.
==Early life==
Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli was born on the second day of Lent, 2 March 1876, in Rome into an upper-class family of intense Catholic piety with a history of ties to the papacy (the &quot;Black Nobility&quot;). His parents were (1837–1916) and Virginia (née Graziosi) Pacelli (1844–1920). His grandfather had been Under-Secretary in the Papal Ministry of Finances and then Secretary of the Interior under Pope Pius IX from 1851 to 1870 and helped found the Vatican&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;L&#x27;Osservatore Romano&quot; in 1861. His cousin, Ernesto Pacelli, was a key financial advisor to Pope Leo XIII; his father, Filippo Pacelli, a Franciscan tertiary, was the dean of the Roman Rota; and his brother, Francesco Pacelli, became a lay canon lawyer and the legal advisor to Pope Pius XI, in which role he negotiated the Lateran Treaty in 1929 with Benito Mussolini, bringing an end to the Roman Question.

Together with his brother Francesco (1872–1935) and his two sisters, Giuseppina (1874–1955) and Elisabetta (1880–1970), he grew up in the Parione district in the centre of Rome. Soon after the family had moved to Via Vetrina in 1880, he began school at the convent of the French Sisters of Divine Providence in the Piazza Fiammetta. The family worshipped at Chiesa Nuova. Eugenio and the other children made their First Communion at this church and Eugenio served there as an altar boy from 1886. In 1886, he also was sent to the private school of Professor Giuseppe Marchi, close to the Piazza Venezia. In 1891 Pacelli&#x27;s father sent Eugenio to the Ennio Quirino Visconti Liceo Ginnasio, a state school situated in what had been the Collegio Romano, the premier Jesuit university in Rome.

In 1894, aged 18, Pacelli began his theology studies at Rome&#x27;s oldest seminary, the Almo Collegio Capranica, and in November of the same year, registered to take a philosophy course at the Jesuit Pontifical Gregorian University and theology at the Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare. He was also enrolled at the State University, La Sapienza where he studied modern languages and history. At the end of the first academic year however, in the summer of 1895, he dropped out of both the Capranica and the Gregorian University. According to his sister Elisabetta, the food at the Capranica was to blame. Having received a special dispensation he continued his studies from home and so spent most of his seminary years as an external student. In 1899, he completed his education in Sacred Theology with a doctoral degree awarded on the basis of a short dissertation and an oral examination in Latin.

==Church career==

===Priest and monsignor===

While all other candidates from the Rome diocese were ordained in the Basilica of Saint John Lateran, Pacelli was ordained a priest on Easter Sunday, 2 April 1899, alone in the private chapel of a family friend the Vicegerent of Rome, Francesco di Paola Cassetta. Shortly after ordination he began postgraduate studies in canon law at Sant&#x27;Apollinaire. He received his first assignment as a curate at Chiesa Nuova. In 1901, he entered the Congregation for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, a sub-office of the Vatican Secretariat of State.

Pietro Gasparri, the recently appointed undersecretary at the Department of Extraordinary Affairs, had underscored his proposal to Pacelli to work in the &quot;Vatican&#x27;s equivalent of the Foreign office&quot; by highlighting the &quot;necessity of defending the Church from the onslaughts of secularism and liberalism throughout Europe&quot;. Pacelli became an &quot;apprendista&quot;, an apprentice, in Gasparri&#x27;s department. In January 1901 he was also chosen, by Pope Leo XIII himself, according to an official account, to deliver condolences on behalf of the Vatican to King Edward VII of the United Kingdom after the death of Queen Victoria.

By 1904 Pacelli received his doctorate. The theme of his thesis was the nature of concordats and the function of canon law when a concordat falls into abeyance. Promoted to the position of &quot;minutante&quot;, he prepared digests of reports that had been sent to the Secretariat from all over the world and in the same year became a papal chamberlain. In 1905 he received the title domestic prelate. From 1904 until 1916, he assisted Cardinal Pietro Gasparri in his codification of canon law with the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs. According to John Cornwell &quot;the text, together with the Anti-Modernist Oath, became the means by which the Holy See was to establish and sustain the new, unequal, and unprecedented power relationship that had arisen between the papacy and the Church&quot;.

In 1908, Pacelli served as a Vatican representative on the International Eucharistic Congress, accompanying Rafael Merry del Val to London, where he met Winston Churchill. In 1911, he represented the Holy See at the coronation of George V and Mary.
Pacelli became the under-secretary in 1911, adjunct-secretary in 1912 (a position he received under Pope Pius X and retained under Pope Benedict XV), and secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs in February 1914. On 24 June 1914, just four days before Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria was assassinated in Sarajevo, Pacelli, together with Cardinal Merry del Val, represented the Vatican when the Serbian Concordat was signed. Serbia&#x27;s success in the First Balkan War against Turkey in 1912 had increased the number of Catholics within greater Serbia. At this time Serbia, encouraged by Russia, was challenging Austria-Hungary&#x27;s sphere of influence throughout the Balkans. Pius X died on 20 August 1914. His successor Benedict XV named Gasparri as secretary of state and Gasparri took Pacelli with him into the Secretariat of State, making him undersecretary. During World War I, Pacelli maintained the Vatican&#x27;s registry of prisoners of war and worked to implement papal relief initiatives. In 1915, he travelled to Vienna to assist Raffaele Scapinelli, nuncio to Vienna, in his negotiations with Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria regarding Italy.

===Archbishop and papal nuncio===
Pope Benedict XV appointed Pacelli as nuncio to Bavaria on 23 April 1917, consecrating him as titular Archbishop of Sardis in the Sistine Chapel on 13 May 1917, the same day as the first apparition of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Fatima, Portugal. After his consecration, Eugenio Pacelli left for Bavaria. As there was no nuncio to Prussia or Germany at the time, Pacelli was, for all practical purposes, the nuncio to all of the German Empire.

Once in Munich, he conveyed the papal initiative to end the war to German authorities. He met with King Ludwig III on 29 May, and later with Kaiser Wilhelm II and Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg, who replied positively to the Papal initiative. However, Bethmann Hollweg was forced to resign and the German High Command, hoping for a military victory, delayed the German reply until 20 September.

Sister Pascalina Lehnert later recalled that the Nuncio was heartbroken that the Kaiser turned a &quot;deaf ear to all his proposals&quot;. She later wrote, &quot;Thinking back today on that time, when we Germans still all believed that our weapons would be victorious and the Nuncio was deeply sorry that the chance had been missed to save what there was to save, it occurs to me over and over again how clearly he foresaw what was to come. Once as he traced the course of the Rhine with his finger on a map, he said sadly, &#x27;No doubt this will be lost as well&#x27;. I did not want to believe it, but here, too, he was to be proved right.&quot;

For the remainder of the Great War, Pacelli concentrated on Benedict&#x27;s humanitarian efforts especially among Allied POWs in German custody. In the upheaval following the Armistice, a disconcerted Pacelli sought Benedict XV&#x27;s permission to leave Munich, where Kurt Eisner had formed the Free State of Bavaria, and he left for a while to Rorschach, and a tranquil Swiss sanatorium run by nuns. Schioppa, the &quot;uditore&quot;, was left in Munich.

&quot;His recovery began with a &#x27;rapport with the 24-year-old Sister Pascalina Lehnert – she would soon be transferred to Munich when Pacelli &quot;pulled strings at the highest level&quot;.

When he returned to Munich, following Eisner&#x27;s assassination by Bavarian nationalist Count Anton von Arco auf Valley, he informed Gasparri-using Schioppa&#x27;s eye-witness testimony of the chaotic scene at the former royal palace as the trio of Max Levien, Eugen Levine, and Tobias Akselrod sought power: &quot;the scene was indescribable [-] the confusion totally chaotic [-] in the midst of all this, a gang of young women, of dubious appearance, Jews like the rest of them hanging around [-] the boss of this female rabble was Levien&#x27;s mistress, a young Russian woman, a Jew and a divorcée [-] and it was to her that the nunciature was obliged to pay homage in order to proceed [-] Levien is a young man, also Russian and a Jew. Pale, dirty, with drugged eyes, vulgar, repulsive ...&quot; John Cornwell alleges that a worrying impression of anti-Semitism is discernible in the &quot;catalogue of epithets describing their physical and moral repulsiveness&quot; and Pacelli&#x27;s &quot;constant harping on the Jewishness of this party of power usurpers&quot; chimed with the &quot;growing and widespread belief among Germans that the Jews were the instigators of the Bolshevik revolution, their principal aim being the destruction of Christian civilization&quot;. Also according to Cornwell, Pacelli informed Gasparri that &quot;the capital of Bavaria, is suffering under a harsh Jewish-Russian revolutionary tyranny&quot;.
According to Sister Pascalina Lehnert, the Nuncio was repeatedly threatened by emissaries of the Bavarian Soviet Republic. Once, in a violation of international law, the Bavarian Revolutionary Government attempted to confiscate the Nunciature&#x27;s car at gunpoint. Despite their demands, however, Pacelli refused to leave his post.

After the Bavarian Soviet Republic was defeated and toppled by Freikorps and Reichswehr troops, the Nuncio focused on, according to Lehnert, &quot;alleviating the distress of the postwar period, consoling, supporting all in word and deed&quot;.
Pacelli was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Germany on 23 June 1920, and – after the completion of a Bavarian Concordat (1924) – his nunciature was moved to Berlin in August 1925. Many of Pacelli&#x27;s Munich staff stayed with him for the rest of his life, including his advisor Robert Leiber and Sister Pascalina Lehnert—housekeeper, cook, friend, and adviser for 41 years. In Berlin, Pacelli was Dean of the Diplomatic Corps and active in diplomatic and many social activities. He was aided by the German priest Ludwig Kaas, who was known for his expertise in Church-state relations and was a full-time politician, politically active in the Catholic Centre Party, a party he led following Wilhelm Marx&#x27;s resignation in October 1928. While in Germany, he travelled to all regions, attended Katholikentag (national gatherings of the faithful), and delivered some 50 sermons and speeches to the German people. In Berlin he lived in the Tiergarten quarter and threw parties for the official and diplomatic elite. Paul von Hindenburg, Gustav Stresemann, and other members of the Cabinet were regular guests.

In post-war Germany, in the absence of a nuncio in Moscow, Pacelli worked also on diplomatic arrangements between the Vatican and the Soviet Union. He negotiated food shipments for Russia, where the Catholic Church was persecuted. He met with Soviet representatives including Foreign Minister Georgi Chicherin, who rejected any kind of religious education, the ordination of priests and bishops, but offered agreements without the points vital to the Vatican.

Despite Vatican pessimism and a lack of visible progress, Pacelli continued the secret negotiations, until Pius XI ordered them to be discontinued in 1927. Pacelli supported German diplomatic activity aimed at rejection of punitive measures from victorious former enemies. He blocked French attempts for an ecclesiastical separation of the Saar region, supported the appointment of a papal administrator for Danzig and aided the reintegration of German priests expelled from Poland. A Prussian Concordat was signed on 14 June 1929. Following the Wall Street crash of 1929, the beginnings of a world economic slump appeared, and the days of the Weimar Republic were numbered. Pacelli was summoned back to Rome at this time—the call coming by telegram when he was resting at his favourite retreat, the Rorschach convent sanatorium. He left Berlin on 10 December 1929. David G. Dalin wrote &quot;of the forty-four speeches Pacelli gave in Germany as papal nuncio between 1917 and 1929, forty denounced some aspect of the emerging Nazi ideology&quot;. In 1935 he wrote a letter to Karl Joseph Schulte, the archbishop of Cologne, describing the Nazis as &quot;false prophets with the pride of Lucifer&quot;. and as &quot;bearers of a new faith and a new Evangile&quot; who were attempting to create &quot;a mendacious antimony between faithfulness to the Church and the Fatherland&quot;. Two years later at Notre Dame de Paris he named Germany as &quot;that noble and powerful nation whom bad shepherds would lead astray into an ideology of race&quot;.

===Cardinal Secretary of State and Camerlengo===

Pacelli was made a Cardinal-Priest of Santi Giovanni e Paolo al Celio on 16 December 1929 by Pope Pius XI, and within a few months, on 7 February 1930, Pius XI appointed him Cardinal Secretary of State, responsible for foreign policy and state relations throughout the world. In 1935, Pacelli was named Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church.

As Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli signed concordats with a number of countries and states. Immediately on becoming Cardinal Secretary of State, Pacelli and Ludwig Kaas took up negotiations on a Baden Concordat which continued until the spring and summer of 1932. Papal fiat appointed a supporter of Pacelli and his concordat policy, Conrad Gröber, the new Archbishop of Freiburg, and the treaty was signed in August
1932. Others followed: Austria (1933), Germany (1933), Yugoslavia (1935) and Portugal (1940). The Lateran treaties with Italy (1929) were concluded before Pacelli became Secretary of State. Catholicism had become the sole recognized religion; the powerful democratic Catholic Popular Party, in many ways similar to the Centre Party in Germany, had been disbanded, and in place of political Catholicism the Holy See encouraged Catholic Action. It was permitted only so long as it developed &quot;its activity outside every political party and in direct dependence upon the Church hierarchy for the dissemination and implementation of Catholic principles&quot;. Such concordats allowed the Catholic Church to organize youth groups, make ecclesiastical appointments, run schools, hospitals, and charities, or even conduct religious services. They also ensured that canon law would be recognized within some spheres (e.g., church decrees of nullity in the area of marriage).

As the decade began Pacelli wanted the Centre Party in Germany to turn away from the socialists. In the summer of 1931 he clashed with Catholic Chancellor Heinrich Brüning, who frankly told Pacelli he believed that he &quot;misunderstood the political situation in Germany and the real character of the Nazis&quot;. Following Brüning&#x27;s resignation in May 1932 Pacelli, like the new Catholic chancellor Franz von Papen, wondered if the Centre Party should look to the Right for a coalition, &quot;that would correspond to their principles&quot;. He made many diplomatic visits throughout Europe and the Americas, including an extensive visit to the United States in 1936 where he met President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who appointed a personal envoy—who did not require Senate confirmation—to the Holy See in December 1939, re-establishing a diplomatic tradition that had been broken since 1870 when the Pope lost temporal power.

Pacelli presided as Papal Legate over the International Eucharistic Congress in Buenos Aires, Argentina on 10–14 October 1934, and in Budapest on 25–30 May 1938. At this time, anti-semitic laws were in the process of being formulated in Hungary. Pacelli made reference to the Jews &quot;whose lips curse [Christ] and whose hearts reject him even today&quot;. This traditional adversarial relationship with Judaism would be reversed in &quot;Nostra aetate&quot; issued during the Second Vatican Council. According to Joseph Bottum, Pacelli in 1937 &quot;warned A. W. Klieforth, that Hitler was &#x27;an untrustworthy scoundrel and fundamentally wicked person&#x27;, to quote Klieforth, who also wrote that Pacelli &#x27;did not believe Hitler capable of moderation, and ... fully supported the German bishops in their anti-Nazi stand&#x27;. This was matched with the discovery of Pacelli&#x27;s anti-Nazi report, written the following year for President Roosevelt and filed with Ambassador Joseph Kennedy, which declared that the church regarded compromise with the Third Reich as &#x27;out of the question&#x27;.&quot;

Historian Walter Bussmann argued that Pacelli, as Cardinal Secretary of State, dissuaded Pope Pius XI – who was nearing death at the time—from condemning the &quot;Kristallnacht&quot; in November 1938, when he was informed of it by the papal nuncio in Berlin.

The draft encyclical &quot;Humani generis unitas&quot; (&quot;On the Unity of the Human Race&quot;) was ready in September 1938 but, according to those responsible for an edition of the document and other sources, it was not forwarded to the Holy See by the Jesuit General Wlodimir Ledóchowski. The draft encyclical contained an open and clear condemnation of colonialism, racial persecution and antisemitism. Historians Passelecq and Suchecky have argued that Pacelli learned about the existence of the draft only after the death of Pius XI and did not promulgate it as Pope. He did use parts of it in his inaugural encyclical &quot;Summi Pontificatus&quot;, which he titled &quot;On the Unity of Human Society&quot;. His various positions on church and policy issues during his tenure as Cardinal Secretary of State were made public by the Holy See in 1939. Most noteworthy among the 50 speeches is his review of Church-State issues in Budapest in 1938.

A year before his papal election, on 26 January 1938, the Cardinal Secretary of State officiated at the baptism of the Infante Juan Carlos (King of Spain from 1975 to 2014), in a ceremony held at the Palazzo Malta in Rome.

===&quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; and &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot;===


The &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; was an integral part of four concordats Pacelli concluded on behalf of the Vatican with German States. The state concordats were necessary because the German federalist Weimar constitution gave the German states authority in the area of education and culture and thus diminished the authority of the churches in these areas; this diminution of church authority was a primary concern of the Vatican. As Bavarian nuncio, Pacelli negotiated successfully with the Bavarian authorities in 1924. He expected the concordat with Catholic Bavaria to be the model for the rest of Germany. Prussia showed interest in negotiations only after the Bavarian concordat. However, Pacelli obtained less favorable conditions for the church in the Prussian Concordat of 1929, which excluded educational issues. A concordat with the German state of Baden was completed by Pacelli in 1932, after he had moved to Rome. There he also negotiated a concordat with Austria in 1933. A total of 16 concordats and treaties with European states had been concluded in the ten-year period 1922–1932.

The &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot;, signed on 20 July 1933, between Germany and the Holy See, while thus a part of an overall Vatican policy, was controversial from its beginning. It remains the most important of Pacelli&#x27;s concordats. It is debated, not because of its content, which is still valid today, but because of its timing. A national concordat with Germany was one of Pacelli&#x27;s main objectives as secretary of state, because he had hoped to strengthen the legal position of the church. Pacelli, who knew German conditions well, emphasized in particular protection for Catholic associations (§31), freedom for education and Catholic schools, and freedom for publications.

As nuncio during the 1920s, he had made unsuccessful attempts to obtain German agreement for such a treaty, and between 1930 and 1933 he attempted to initiate negotiations with representatives of successive German governments, but the opposition of Protestant and Socialist parties, the instability of national governments and the care of the individual states to guard their autonomy thwarted this aim. In particular, the questions of denominational schools and pastoral work in the armed forces prevented any agreement on the national level, despite talks in the winter of 1932.

Adolf Hitler was appointed Chancellor on 30 January 1933 and sought to gain international respectability and to remove internal opposition by representatives of the church and the Catholic Centre Party. He sent his vice chancellor Franz von Papen, a Catholic nobleman, to Rome to offer negotiations about a Reichskonkordat. On behalf of Pacelli, Prelate Ludwig Kaas, the outgoing chairman of the Centre Party, negotiated first drafts of the terms with von Papen. The concordat was finally signed, by Pacelli for the Vatican and von Papen for Germany, on 20 July and ratified on 10 September 1933. Bishop Konrad von Preysing cautioned against compromise with the new regime, against those who saw the Nazi persecution of the church as an aberration that Hitler would correct.

Between 1933 and 1939, Pacelli issued 55 protests of violations of the &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot;. Most notably, early in 1937, Pacelli asked several German cardinals, including Cardinal Michael von Faulhaber, to help him write a protest of Nazi violations of the &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot;; this was to become Pius XI&#x27;s 1937 encyclical, &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot;. The encyclical was written in German and not the usual Latin of official Catholic Church documents. Secretly distributed by an army of motorcyclists and read from every German Catholic Church pulpit on Palm Sunday, it condemned the paganism of the Nazi ideology. Pius XI credited its creation and writing to Pacelli. It was the first official denunciation of Nazism made by any major organization and resulted in persecution of the church by the infuriated Nazis who closed all the participating presses and &quot;took numerous vindictive measures against the Church, including staging a long series of immorality trials of the Catholic clergy&quot;. On 10 June 1941, the Pope commented on the problems of the &quot;Reichskonkordat&quot; in a letter to the Bishop of Passau, in Bavaria: &quot;The history of the Reichskonkordat shows, that the other side lacked the most basic prerequisites to accept minimal freedoms and rights of the Church, without which the Church simply cannot live and operate, formal agreements notwithstanding&quot;.

===Relations with the media===
Cardinal Pacelli gave a lecture entitled &quot;La Presse et L&#x27;Apostolat&quot; at the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; on 17 April 1936.

==Papacy==
===Election and coronation===

Pope Pius XI died on 10 February 1939. Several historians have interpreted the conclave to choose his successor as facing a choice between a diplomatic or a spiritual candidate, and they view Pacelli&#x27;s diplomatic experience, especially with Germany, as one of the deciding factors in his election on 2 March 1939, his 63rd birthday, after only one day of deliberation and three ballots. He was the first cardinal Secretary of State to be elected pope since Clement IX in 1667. He was one of only two men known to have served as Camerlengo immediately prior to being elected as pope (the other being Pope Leo XIII). According to rumours, he asked for another ballot to be taken to ensure the validity of his election. After his election was indeed confirmed, he chose the name Pius XII in honour of his immediate predecessor.

His coronation took place on 12 March 1939. Upon being elected pope he was also formally the Grand Master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, prefect of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Churches and prefect of the Sacred Consistorial Congregation. There was however a Cardinal-Secretary to run these bodies on a day-to-day basis.

Pacelli took the same papal name as his predecessor, a title used exclusively by Italian Popes. He was quoted as saying &quot;I call myself Pius; my whole life was under Popes with this name, but especially as a sign of gratitude towards Pius XI.&quot; On 15 December 1937, during his last consistory, Pius XI strongly hinted to the cardinals that he expected Pacelli to be his successor, saying &quot;He is in your midst.&quot; He had previously been quoted as saying: &quot;When today the Pope dies, you&#x27;ll get another one tomorrow, because the Church continues. It would be a much bigger tragedy, if Cardinal Pacelli dies, because there is only one. I pray every day, God may send another one into one of our seminaries, but as of today, there is only one in this world.&quot;

===Appointments===
After his election, he made Luigi Maglione his successor as Cardinal Secretary of State. Cardinal Maglione, a seasoned Vatican diplomat, had reestablished diplomatic relations with Switzerland and was for twelve years nuncio in Paris. Yet, Maglione did not exercise the influence of his predecessor Pacelli, who as Pope continued his close relation with Giovanni Battista Montini (later Pope Paul VI) and Domenico Tardini. After the death of Maglione in 1944, Pius left the position open and named Tardini head of its foreign section and Montini head of the internal section. Tardini and Montini continued serving there until 1953, when Pius XII decided to appoint them cardinals, an honor which both turned down. They were then later appointed to be Pro-Secretary with the privilege to wear Episcopal Insignia. Tardini continued to be a close co-worker of the Pope until the death of Pius XII, while Montini became archbishop of Milan, after the death of Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster.

Pius XII slowly eroded the Italian monopoly on the Roman Curia; he employed German and Dutch Jesuit advisors, Robert Leiber, Augustin Bea, and Sebastian Tromp. He also supported the elevation of Americans such as Cardinal Francis Spellman from a minor to a major role in the church. After World War II, Pius XII appointed more non-Italians than any Pope before him. American appointees included Joseph P. Hurley as regent of the nunciature in Belgrade, Gerald P. O&#x27;Hara as nuncio to Romania, and Aloisius Joseph Muench as nuncio to Germany. For the first time, numerous young Europeans, Asians and &quot;Americans were trained in various congregations and secretariats within the Vatican for eventual service throughout the world&quot;.

===Consistories===

Only twice in his pontificate did Pius XII hold a consistory to create new cardinals, in contrast to Pius XI, who had done so 17 times in as many years. Pius XII chose not to name new cardinals during World War II, and the number of cardinals shrank to 38, with Dennis Joseph Dougherty of Philadelphia being the only living U.S. cardinal.

The first occasion on 18 February 1946 yielded the elevation of a record 32 new cardinals, almost half of the College of Cardinals and reaching the canonical limit of 70 cardinals. In the 1946 consistory, Pius XII, while maintaining the maximum size of the College of Cardinals at 70, named cardinals from China, India, the Middle East and increased the number of Cardinals from the Americas, proportionally lessening the Italian influence.

In his second consistory on 12 January 1953, it was expected that his closest co-workers, Msgrs. Domenico Tardini and Giovanni Montini would be elevated and Pius XII informed the assembled cardinals that both of them were originally on the top of his list, but they had turned down the offer, and were rewarded instead with other promotions. Both Montini and Tardini would become Cardinals shortly after Pius&#x27; death; Montini later became Pope Paul VI. The two consistories of 1946 and 1953 brought an end to over five hundred years of Italians constituting a majority of the College of Cardinals.

With few exceptions, Italian prelates accepted the changes positively; there was no protest movement or open opposition to the internationalization efforts.

==Church reforms==
===Liturgy reforms===
In his encyclical &quot;Mediator Dei&quot;, Pius XII links liturgy with the last will of Jesus Christ.

The church has, therefore, according to Pius XII, a common aim with Christ himself, teaching all men the truth, and offering to God a pleasing and acceptable sacrifice. This way, the church re-establishes the unity between the Creator and His creatures. The Sacrifice of the Altar, being Christ&#x27;s own actions, conveys and dispenses divine grace from Christ to the members of the Mystical Body.

Bishop Carlos Duarte Costa, a long-time critic of Pius XII&#x27;s policies during World War II and an opponent of clerical celibacy and the use of Latin as language of the liturgy, was excommunicated by Pius XII on 2 July 1945. He later established a schismatic group called the &quot;Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church&quot;.

==Canon law reforms==
Decentralized authority and increased independence of the Uniate Churches were aimed at in the Canon Law/Codex Iuris Canonici (CIC) reform. In its new constitutions, Eastern Patriarchs were made almost independent from Rome (CIC Orientalis, 1957) Eastern marriage law (CIC Orientalis, 1949), civil law (CIC Orientalis, 1950), laws governing religious associations (CIC Orientalis, 1952) property law (CIC Orientalis, 1952) and other laws. These reforms and writings of Pius XII were intended to establish Eastern Orientals as equal parts of the mystical body of Christ, as explained in the encyclical &quot;Mystici Corporis Christi&quot;.

===Priests and religious===
With the Apostolic constitution &quot;Sedis Sapientiae&quot;, Pius XII added social sciences, sociology, psychology and social psychology, to the pastoral training of future priests. Pius XII emphasised the need to systematically analyze the psychological condition of candidates to the priesthood to ensure that they are capable of a life of celibacy and service. Pius XII added one year to the theological formation of future priests. He included a &quot;pastoral year&quot;, an introduction into the practise of parish work.

Pius XII wrote in &quot;Menti Nostrae&quot; that the call to constant interior reform and Christian heroism means to be above average, to be a living example of Christian virtue. The strict norms governing their lives are meant to make them models of Christian perfection for lay people. Bishops are encouraged to look at model saints like Boniface, and Pope Pius X. Priests were encouraged to be living examples of the love of Christ and his sacrifice.

==Theology==
Pius XII explained the Catholic faith in 41 encyclicals and almost 1000 messages and speeches during his long pontificate. &quot;Mystici Corporis Christi&quot; clarified membership and participation in the church. The encyclical &quot;Divino afflante Spiritu&quot; opened the doors for biblical research. His magisterium was far larger and is difficult to summarize. In numerous speeches Catholic teaching is related to various aspects of life, education, medicine, politics, war and peace, the life of saints, Mary, the Mother of God, things eternal and contemporary. Theologically, Pius XII specified the nature of the teaching authority of the Catholic Church. He also gave a new freedom to engage in theological investigations.

===Theological orientation===
====Biblical research====

The encyclical &quot;Divino afflante Spiritu&quot;, published in 1943, emphasized the role of the Bible. Pius XII freed biblical research from previous limitations. He encouraged Christian theologians to revisit original versions of the Bible in Greek and Hebrew. Noting improvements in archaeology, the encyclical reversed Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s encyclical, which had only advocated going back to the original texts to resolve ambiguity in the Latin Vulgate. The encyclical demands a much better understanding of ancient Hebrew history and traditions. It requires bishops throughout the church to initiate biblical studies for lay people. The Pontiff also requests a reorientation of Catholic teaching and education, relying much more on sacred scriptures in sermons and religious instruction.

====Role of theology====
This theological investigative freedom does not, however, extend to all aspects of theology. According to Pius, theologians, employed by the Catholic Church, are assistants, to teach the official teachings of the church and not their own private thoughts. They are free to engage in empirical research, which the church generously supports, but in matters of morality and religion, they are subjected to the teaching office and authority of the church, the Magisterium. &quot;The most noble office of theology is to show how a doctrine defined by the Church is contained in the sources of revelation, ... in that sense in which it has been defined by the Church.&quot; The deposit of faith is authentically interpreted not to each of the faithful, not even to theologians, but only to the teaching authority of the Church.

===Mariology and the dogma of the Assumption===
====World consecration to the Immaculate Heart of Mary====
As a young boy and in later life, Pacelli was an ardent follower of the Virgin Mary. He was consecrated as a bishop on 13 May 1917, the very first day of the apparitions of Our Lady of Fátima. Based on the Portuguese mystic Alexandrina of Balazar&#x27;s requests, he consecrated the world to the Immaculate Heart of Mary in 1942. His remains were to be buried in the crypt of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica on the feast day of Our Lady of Fátima, 13 October 1958.

====Dogma of the Assumption of Mary====

On 1 November 1950, Pius XII invoked papal infallibility for the first time since 1854 by defining the dogma of the Assumption of Mary, namely that she &quot;having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory&quot;. To date this is the last time full papal infallibility has been used. The dogma was preceded by the 1946 encyclical &quot;Deiparae Virginis Mariae&quot;, which requested all Catholic bishops to express their opinion on a possible dogmatization. On 8 September 1953, the encyclical &quot;Fulgens corona&quot; announced a Marian year for 1954, the centennial of the Dogma of the Immaculate Conception. In the encyclical &quot;Ad caeli reginam&quot; he promulgated the Queenship of Mary feast. &quot;Mystici Corporis Christi&quot; summarizes his mariology. On 15 August 1954, the Feast of the Assumption, he initiated the practice of leading the Angelus every Sunday before address to the crowd assembled at Castel Gandolfo.

===Social teachings===

====Medical theology====
Pius XII delivered numerous speeches to medical professionals and researchers. He addressed doctors, nurses, midwives, to detail all aspects of rights and dignity of patients, medical responsibilities, moral implications of psychological illnesses and the uses of psycho pharmaca. He also took on issues like the uses of medicine in terminally ill persons, medical lies in face of grave illness, and the rights of family members to make decisions against expert medical advice. Pope Pius XII often reconsidered previously accepted truth, thus he was first to determine that the use of pain medicine in terminally ill patients is justified, even if this may shorten the life of the patient, as long as life shortening is not the objective itself.

====Family and sexuality====
Pope Pius XII developed an extensive theology of the family, taking issue with family roles, sharing of household duties, education of children, conflict resolution, financial dilemmas, psychological problems, illness, taking care of older generations, unemployment, marital holiness and virtue, common prayer, religious discussions and more. He accepted the rhythm method as a moral form of family planning, although only in limited circumstances, within the context of family.

====Theology and science====
To Pius XII, science and religion were heavenly sisters, different manifestations of divine exactness, who could not possibly contradict each other over the long term. Regarding their relation, his advisor Professor Robert Leiber wrote: &quot;Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors prematurely. He was energetic on this point and regretted that in the case of Galileo.&quot;

====Evolution of the human body====

In 1950, Pius XII promulgated &quot;Humani generis&quot;, which acknowledged that evolution might accurately describe the biological origins of the human form, but at the same time criticized those who &quot;imprudently and indiscreetly hold that evolution ... explains the origin of all things&quot;. Catholics must believe that the human soul was created immediately by God. Since the soul is a spiritual substance, it is not brought into being through transformation of matter, but directly by God, whence the special uniqueness of each person. Fifty years later, Pope John Paul II, stating that scientific evidence now seemed to favour the evolutionary theory, upheld the distinction of Pius XII regarding the human soul. &quot;Even if the human body originates from pre-existent living matter, the spiritual soul is spontaneously created by God.&quot;

====Capital punishment====
In an address given on 14 September 1952, Pope Pius XII said that the church does not regard the execution of criminals as a violation by the State of the universal right to life:

When it is a question of the execution of a condemned man, the State does not dispose of the individual&#x27;s right to life. In this case it is reserved to the public power to deprive the condemned person of the enjoyment of life in expiation of his crime when, by his crime, he has already disposed himself of his right to live.

The church regards criminal penalties as both &quot;medicinal&quot;, preventing the criminal from re-offending, and &quot;vindictive&quot;, providing retribution for the offense committed. Pius defended the authority of the State to carry out punishment, up to and including the death penalty.

====Democracy and monarchy====
Pius XII taught that the masses were a threat to true democracy. In such a democracy, liberty is the individual&#x27;s moral duty and equality is the right of all people to honorably live in the place and station that God has assigned them.

On 1 June 1946, one day before the 1946 Italian institutional referendum on whether to abolish or keep the Italian monarchy, Pius XII delivered a sermon on St. Peter&#x27;s Square. While he did not directly mention monarchy or republicanism, given the context, his speech was nonetheless widely seen as endorsing Umberto II in the referendum, with it being difficult to misunderstand his plea.

Pius stated:

The problem is whether one or the other of those nations, of those two Latin sisters [elections were taking place in France on the same day] with several thousands of years of civilization will continue to learn against the solid rock of Christianity...or on the contrary do they want to hand over the fate of their future to the impossible omnipotence of a material state without extraterrestrial ideals, without religion, and without God. One of these two alternatives shall occur according to whether the names of the champions or the destroyers of Christian civilization emerge victorious from the urns.

After the referendum was successful and the Italian monarchy was abolished, Pius privately agreed with his envoy Myron Taylor &quot;...that it would have been far preferable for Italy to remain a monarchy, but he also noted that what was done was done&quot;.

===Encyclicals, writings and speeches===

Pius XII issued 41 encyclicals during his pontificate—more than all his successors in the past 50 years taken together—along with many other writings and speeches. The pontificate of Pius XII was the first in Vatican history that published papal speeches and addresses in vernacular language on a systematic basis. Until then, papal documents were issued mainly in Latin in &quot;Acta Apostolicae Sedis&quot; since 1909. Because of the novelty of it all, and a feared occupation of the Vatican by the German Wehrmacht, not all documents exist today. In 1944, a number of papal documents were burned or &quot;walled in&quot;.

Several encyclicals addressed the Eastern Catholic Churches. &quot;Orientalis Ecclesiae&quot; was issued in 1944 on the 15th centenary of the death of Cyril of Alexandria, a saint common to Eastern Christianity and Latin Churches. Pius XII asks for prayer for better understanding and unification of the churches. &quot;Orientales omnes Ecclesias&quot;, issued in 1945 on the 350th anniversary of the reunion, is a call to continued unity of the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church, threatened in its very existence by the authorities of the Soviet Union. &quot;Sempiternus Rex&quot; was issued in 1951 on the 1500th anniversary of the Ecumenical Council of Chalcedon. It included a call to oriental communities adhering to Miaphysite theology to return to the Catholic Church. &quot;Orientales Ecclesias&quot; was issued in 1952 and addressed to the Eastern Churches, protesting the continued Stalinist persecution of the church. Several Apostolic Letters were sent to the bishops in the East. On 13 May 1956, Pope Pius addressed all bishops of the Eastern Rite. Mary, the mother of God, was the subject of encyclical letters to the people of Russia in &quot;Fulgens corona&quot;, as well as a papal letter to the people of Russia.

Pius XII made two substantial interventions on the media. His 1955 discourse &quot;The Ideal Movie&quot;, originally given in two parts to members of the Italian cinema industry, offered a &quot;sophisticated analysis of the film industry and the role of cinema in modern society&quot;. Compared to his predecessor&#x27;s teaching, the encyclical &quot;Miranda Prorsus&quot; (1957) shows a &quot;high regard for the importance of cinema, television, and radio&quot;.

===Feasts and devotions===
In 1958, Pope Pius XII declared the Feast of the Holy Face of Jesus as Shrove Tuesday (the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday) for all Catholics. The first medal of the Holy Face, produced by Sister Maria Pierina de Micheli, based on the image on the Shroud of Turin had been offered to Pius XII who approved the medal and the devotion based on it. The general devotion to the Holy Face of Jesus had been approved by Pope Leo XIII in 1885 before the image on the Turin Shroud had been photographed.

==Canonisations and beatifications==

Pope Pius XII canonized numerous people, including Pope Pius X—&quot;both were determined to stamp out, as far as possible, all traces of dangerous heterodoxy&quot;—and Maria Goretti. He beatified Pope Innocent XI. The first canonizations were two women, the founder of a congregation for women, Mary Euphrasia Pelletier, and a young laywoman, Gemma Galgani. Pelletier had a reputation for opening new ways for Catholic charities, helping people in difficulties with the law, who had been neglected by the system and the church. Galgani was a virtuous woman in her twenties, said to have the stigmata.

Pius XII also named Anthony of Padua as a Doctor of the Church on 16 January 1946 while conferring upon him the title &quot;Doctor evangelius&quot;.

==World War II==

During World War II Pius saw his primary obligation as being to ensure the continuation of the &quot;Church visible&quot; and its divine mission. Pius XII lobbied world leaders to prevent the outbreak of World War II and then expressed his dismay that war had come in his October 1939 &quot;Summi Pontificatus&quot; encyclical. He followed a strict public policy of Vatican neutrality for the duration of the conflict mirroring that of Pope Benedict XV.

In 1939, Pius XII turned the Vatican into a centre of aid which he organized from various parts of the world. At the request of the Pope, an information office for prisoners of war and refugees operated in the Vatican under Giovanni Battista Montini, which in the years of its existence from 1939 until 1947 received almost 10 million (9,891,497) information requests and produced over 11 million (11,293,511) answers about missing persons.

McGoldrick (2012) concludes that during the war:

Pius XII had genuine affection for Germany, though not the criminal element into whose hands it had fallen; he feared Bolshevism, an ideology dedicated to the annihilation of the church of which he was head, but his sympathies lay with the Allies and the democracies, especially the United States, into whose war economy he had transferred and invested the Vatican&#x27;s considerable assets.

===Outbreak of war===
====Summi Pontificatus====
&quot;Summi Pontificatus&quot; was the first papal encyclical issued by Pope Pius XII, in October 1939 and established some of the themes of his pontificate. During the drafting of the letter, the Second World War commenced with the German/Soviet invasion of Poland—the &quot;dread tempest of war is already raging despite all Our efforts to avert it&quot;. The papal letter denounced antisemitism, war, totalitarianism, the attack on Catholic Poland and the Nazi persecution of the church.

Pius XII reiterated church teaching on the &quot;principle of equality&quot;—with specific reference to Jews: &quot;there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision&quot;. The forgetting of solidarity &quot;imposed by our common origin and by the equality of rational nature in all men&quot; was called &quot;pernicious error&quot;. Catholics everywhere were called upon to offer &quot;compassion and help&quot; to the victims of the war. The Pope declared determination to work to hasten the return of peace and trust in prayers for justice, love and mercy, to prevail against the scourge of war. The letter also decried the deaths of noncombatants.

Following themes addressed in &quot;Non abbiamo bisogno&quot; (1931); &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; (1937) and &quot;Divini redemptoris&quot; (1937), Pius wrote against &quot;anti-Christian movements&quot; and needing to bring back to the church those who were following &quot;a false standard ... misled by error, passion, temptation and prejudice, [who] have strayed away from faith in the true God&quot;. Pius wrote of &quot;Christians unfortunately more in name than in fact&quot; having shown &quot;cowardice&quot; in the face of persecution by these creeds, and endorsed resistance:

Pius wrote of a persecuted church and a time requiring &quot;charity&quot; for victims who had a &quot;right&quot; to compassion. Against the invasion of Poland and killing of civilians he wrote:

With Italy not yet an ally of Hitler in the war, Italians were called upon to remain faithful to the Catholic Church. Pius avoided explicit denunciations of Hitlerism or Stalinism, establishing the &quot;impartial&quot; public tone which would become controversial in later assessment of his pontificate: &quot;A full statement of the doctrinal stand to be taken in face of the errors of today, if necessary, can be put off to another time unless there is disturbance by calamitous external events; for the moment We limit Ourselves to some fundamental observations.&quot;

====Invasion of Poland====
In &quot;Summi Pontificatus&quot;, Pius expressed dismay at the killing of non-combatants in the Nazi/Soviet invasion of Poland and expressed hope for the &quot;resurrection&quot; of that country. The Nazis and Soviets commenced a persecution of the Catholic Church in Poland. In April 1940, the Vatican advised the U.S. government that its efforts to provide humanitarian aid had been blocked by the Germans and that the Holy See had been forced to seek indirect channels through which to direct its aid. Michael Phayer, a critic of Pius XII, assesses his policy as having been to &quot;refuse to censure&quot; the &quot;German&quot; invasion and annexation of Poland. This, Phayer wrote, was regarded as a &quot;betrayal&quot; by many Polish Catholics and clergy, who saw his appointment of Hilarius Breitinger as the apostolic administrator for the Wartheland in May 1942, an &quot;implicit recognition&quot; of the breakup of Poland; the opinions of the &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot;, mostly German Catholic minorities living in occupied Poland, were more mixed. Phayer argues that Pius XII—both before and during his papacy – consistently &quot;deferred to Germany at the expense of Poland&quot;, and saw Germany—not Poland—as critical to &quot;rebuilding a large Catholic presence in Central Europe&quot;. In May 1942, Kazimierz Papée, Polish ambassador to the Vatican, complained that Pius had failed to condemn the recent wave of atrocities in Poland; when Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione replied that the Vatican could not document individual atrocities, Papée declared, &quot;when something becomes notorious, proof is not required&quot;. Although Pius XII received frequent reports about atrocities committed by and/or against Catholics, his knowledge was incomplete; for example, he wept after the war on learning that Cardinal August Hlond had banned German liturgical services in Poland.

There was a well-known case of Jewish rabbis who, seeking support against the Nazi persecution of Polish Jews in the General Government (Nazi-occupied Polish zone), complained to the representatives of the Catholic Church. The church&#x27;s attempted intervention caused the Nazis to retaliate by arresting rabbis and deporting them to the death camp. Subsequently, the Catholic Church in Poland abandoned direct intervention, instead focusing on organizing underground aid, with huge international support orchestrated by Pope Pius XII and his Holy See. The Pope was informed about Nazi atrocities committed in Poland by both officials of the Polish Church and the Polish Underground. Those intelligence materials were used by Pius XII on 11 March 1940 during a formal audience with Joachim von Ribbentrop (Hitler&#x27;s foreign affairs adviser) when Pope was &quot;listing the date, place, and precise details of each crime&quot; as described by Joseph L. Lichten after others.

====Early actions to end conflict====
With Poland overrun, but France and the Low Countries yet to be attacked, Pius continued to hope for a negotiated peace to prevent the spread of the conflict. The similarly minded U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt re-established American diplomatic relations with the Vatican after a 70-year hiatus and dispatched Myron C. Taylor as his personal representative. Pius warmly welcomed Roosevelt&#x27;s envoy and peace initiative, calling it &quot;an exemplary act of fraternal and hearty solidarity... in defence against the chilling breath of aggressive and deadly godless anti-Christian tendencies&quot;. American correspondence spoke of &quot;parallel endeavours for peace and the alleviation of suffering&quot;. Despite the early collapse of peace hopes, the Taylor mission continued at the Vatican.

According to Hitler biographer John Toland, following the November 1939 assassination attempt by Johann Georg Elser, Hitler said Pius would have wanted the plot to succeed: &quot;he&#x27;s no friend of mine&quot;. In the spring of 1940, a group of German generals seeking to overthrow Hitler and make peace with the British approached Pope Pius XII, who acted as an interlocutor between the British and the abortive plot. According to Toland, Munich lawyer Joseph Muller made a clandestine trip to Rome in October 1939, met with Pius XII and found him willing to act as intermediary. The Vatican agreed to send a letter outlining the bases for peace with England and the participation of the Pope was used to try to persuade senior German Generals Franz Halder and Walther von Brauchitsch to act against Hitler.

Pius warned the Allies of the planned German invasion of the Low Countries in 1940. In Rome in 1942, U.S. envoy Myron C. Taylor, thanked the Holy See for the &quot;forthright and heroic expressions of indignation made by Pope Pius XII when Germany invaded the Low countries&quot;. After Germany invaded the Low Countries during 1940, Pius XII sent expressions of sympathy to Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands, King Leopold III of Belgium, and Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. When Mussolini learned of the warnings and the telegrams of sympathy, he took them as a personal affront and had his ambassador to the Vatican file an official protest, charging that Pius XII had taken sides against Italy&#x27;s ally Germany. Mussolini&#x27;s foreign minister Galeazzo Ciano claimed that Pius XII was &quot;ready to let himself be deported to a concentration camp, rather than do anything against his conscience&quot;.

When, in 1940, the Nazi Foreign Minister von Ribbentrop led the only senior Nazi delegation permitted an audience with Pius XII and he asked why the Pope had sided with the Allies, Pius replied with a list of recent Nazi atrocities and religious persecutions committed against Christians and Jews, in Germany, and in Poland, leading &quot;The New York Times&quot; to headline its report &quot;Jews Rights Defended&quot; and write of &quot;burning words he spoke to Herr Ribbentrop about religious persecution&quot;. During the meeting, von Ribbentrop suggested an overall settlement between the Vatican and the Reich government in exchange for Pius XII instructing the German bishops to refrain from political criticism of the German government, but no agreement was reached.

At a special mass at St Peters for the victims of the war, held in November 1940, soon after the commencement of the London Blitz bombing by the Luftwaffe, Pius preached in his homily: &quot;may the whirlwinds, that in the light of day or the dark of night, scatter terror, fire, destruction, and slaughter on helpless folk cease. May justice and charity on one side and on the other be in perfect balance, so that all injustice be repaired, the reign of right restored&quot;. Later he appealed to the Allies to spare Rome from aerial bombing, and visited wounded victims of the Allied bombing of 19 July 1943.

====Widening conflict====
Pius attempted, unsuccessfully, to dissuade the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini from joining Hitler in the war. In April 1941, Pius XII granted a private audience to Ante Pavelić, the leader of the newly proclaimed Croatian state (rather than the diplomatic audience Pavelić had wanted). Pius was criticised for his reception of Pavelić: an unattributed British Foreign Office memo on the subject described Pius as &quot;the greatest moral coward of our age&quot;. The Vatican did not officially recognise Pavelić&#x27;s regime. While Pius XII did not publicly condemn the expulsions and forced conversions to Catholicism perpetrated on Serbs by Pavelić, the Holy See did expressly repudiate the forced conversions in a memorandum dated 25 January 1942, from the Vatican Secretariat of State to the Yugoslavian Legation. The Pope was well informed of Catholic clergy involvement with the Ustaše regime, even possessing a list of clergy members who had &quot;joined in the slaughter&quot;, but decided against condemning the regime or taking action against the clergy involved, fearing that it would lead to schism in the Croatian church or undermine the formation of a future Croatian state. Pius XII would elevate Aloysius Stepinac—a Croatian archbishop convicted of collaborating with the Ustaše by the newly established Yugoslav Communist regime—to the cardinalate in 1953. Phayer agrees that Stepinac&#x27;s was a &quot;show trial&quot;, but states &quot;the charge that he [Pius XII] supported the Ustaša regime was, of course, true, as everyone knew&quot;, and that &quot;if Stepinac had responded to the charges against him, his defense would have inevitably unraveled, exposing the Vatican&#x27;s support of the genocidal Pavelić&quot;. Throughout 1942, the Yugoslav government in exile sent letters of protest to Pius XII asking him to use all possible means to stop the massacres against the Serbs in the Croat state, however Pius XII did nothing.

In 1941, Pius XII interpreted &quot;Divini Redemptoris&quot;, an encyclical of Pope Pius XI, which forbade Catholics to help Communists, as not applying to military assistance to the Soviet Union. This interpretation assuaged American Catholics who had previously opposed Lend-Lease arrangements with the Soviet Union.

In March 1942, Pius XII established diplomatic relations with the Empire of Japan and received ambassador Ken Harada, who remained in that position until the end of the war.

In June 1942, diplomatic relations were established with the Nationalist government of China. This step was envisaged earlier, but delayed due to Japanese pressure to establish relations with the pro-Japanese Wang Jingwei regime. The first Chinese Minister to the Vatican, Hsieh Shou-kang, was only able to arrive at the Vatican in January 1943, due to difficulties of travel resulting from the war. He remained in that position until late 1946.

The Pope employed the new technology of radio and a series of Christmas messages to preach against selfish nationalism and the evils of modern warfare and offer sympathy to the victims of the war. Pius XII&#x27;s 1942 Christmas address via Vatican Radio voiced concern at human rights abuses and the murder of innocents based on race. The majority of the speech spoke generally about human rights and civil society; at the very end of the speech, Pius XII mentioned &quot;the hundreds of thousands of persons who, without any fault on their part, sometimes only because of their nationality or race, have been consigned to death or to a slow decline&quot;. According to Rittner, the speech remains a &quot;lightning rod&quot; in debates about Pius XII. The Nazis themselves responded to the speech by stating that it was &quot;one long attack on everything we stand for. ... He is clearly speaking on behalf of the Jews. ... He is virtually accusing the German people of injustice toward the Jews, and makes himself the mouthpiece of the Jewish war criminals.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;The voice of Pius XII is a lonely voice in the silence and darkness enveloping Europe this Christmas. ... In calling for a &#x27;real new order&#x27; based on &#x27;liberty, justice and love&#x27;, ... the Pope put himself squarely against Hitlerism.&quot; Historian Michael Phayer claims, however, that &quot;it is still not clear &quot;whose&quot; genocide or &quot;which&quot; genocide he was referring to&quot;. Speaking on the 50th anniversary of Pius&#x27;s death in 2008, the German Pope Benedict XVI recalled that the Pope&#x27;s voice had been &quot;broken by emotion&quot; as he &quot;deplored the situation&quot; with a &quot;clear reference to the deportation and extermination of the Jews&quot;.

Several authors have alleged a plot to kidnap Pius XII by the Nazis during their occupation of Rome in 1943 (Vatican City itself was not occupied); British historian Owen Chadwick and the Jesuit ADSS editor Robert A. Graham each concluded such claims were an intentional creation of the British Political Warfare Executive. However, in 2007, subsequently to those accounts, Dan Kurzman published a work in which he establishes that the plot was a fact.

In 1944, Pius XII issued a Christmas message in which he warned against rule by the masses and against secular conceptions of liberty and equality.

====Final stages====
As the war was approaching its end in 1945, Pius advocated a lenient policy by the Allied leaders in an effort to prevent what he perceived to be the mistakes made at the end of World War I. On 23 August 1944, he met British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who was visiting Rome. At their meeting, the Pope acknowledged the justice of punishing war criminals, but expressed a hope that the people of Italy would not be punished, preferring that they be made &quot;full allies&quot; in the remaining war effort.

===Holocaust ===

During the Second World War, after Nazi Germany commenced its mass-murder of Jews in occupied Soviet territory, Pius XII employed diplomacy to aid victims of the Holocaust and directed the church to provide discreet aid to Jews. Upon his death in 1958, among many Jewish tributes, the Chief Rabbi of Rome Elio Toaff, said: &quot;Jews will always remember what the Catholic Church did for them by order of the Pope during the Second World War. When the war was raging, Pius spoke out very often to condemn the false race theory.&quot; This is disputed by commentator John Cornwell, who, in his book, &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Pope&quot;, argues that the Pope was weak and vacillating in his approach to Nazism. Cornwell asserts that the Pope did little to challenge the progressing holocaust of the Jews out of fear of provoking the Nazis into invading Vatican City.

In his 1939 &quot;Summi Pontificatus&quot; first papal encyclical, Pius reiterated Catholic teaching against racial persecution and antisemitism and affirmed the ethical principles of the &quot;Revelation on Sinai&quot;. At Christmas 1942, once evidence of the mass-murder of Jews had emerged, Pius XII voiced concern at the murder of &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of &quot;faultless&quot; people because of their &quot;nationality or race&quot; and intervened to attempt to block Nazi deportations of Jews in various countries. Upon his death in 1958, Pius was praised emphatically by the Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir, and other world leaders. But his insistence on Vatican neutrality and avoidance of naming the Nazis as the evildoers of the conflict became the foundation for contemporary and later criticisms from some quarters. His strongest public condemnation of genocide was considered inadequate by the Allied Powers, while the Nazis viewed him as an Allied sympathizer who had dishonoured his policy of Vatican neutrality. Hitler biographer John Toland, while scathing of Pius&#x27;s cautious public comments in relation to the mistreatment of Jews, concluded that the Allies&#x27; own record of action against the Holocaust was &quot;shameful&quot;, while &quot;The Church, under the Pope&#x27;s guidance, had already saved the lives of more Jews than all other churches, religious institutions and rescue organizations combined&quot;.

In 1939, the newly elected Pope Pius XII appointed several prominent Jewish scholars to posts at the Vatican after they had been dismissed from Italian universities under Fascist leader Benito Mussolini&#x27;s racial laws. In 1939, the Pope employed a Jewish cartographer, Roberto Almagia, to work on old maps in the Vatican Library. Almagia had been at the Sapienza University of Rome since 1915 but was dismissed after Benito Mussolini&#x27;s antisemitic legislation of 1938. The Pope&#x27;s appointment of two Jews to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences as well as the hiring of Almagia were reported by &quot;The New York Times&quot; in the editions of 11 November 1939 and 10 January 1940.

Pius later engineered an agreement—formally approved on 23 June 1939—with the President of Brazil Getúlio Vargas to issue 3,000 visas to &quot;non-Aryan Catholics&quot;. However, over the next 18 months, Brazil&#x27;s Conselho de Imigração e Colonização (CIC) continued to tighten the restrictions on their issuance, including requiring a baptismal certificate dated before 1933, a substantial monetary transfer to the Banco do Brasil, and approval by the Brazilian Propaganda Office in Berlin. The program was cancelled 14 months later, after fewer than 1,000 visas had been issued, amid suspicions of &quot;improper conduct&quot; (i.e., continuing to practice Judaism) among those who had received visas.

In April 1939, after the submission of Charles Maurras and the intervention of the Carmel of Lisieux, Pius XII ended his predecessor&#x27;s ban on Action Française, a virulently antisemitic organization.

Following the German/Soviet invasion of Poland, the Pope&#x27;s first encyclical, &quot;Summi Pontificatus&quot; reiterated Catholic teaching against racial persecution and rejected antisemitism, quoting scripture singling out the &quot;principle of equality&quot;—with specific reference to Jews: &quot;there is neither Gentile nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision&quot; and direct affirmation of the Jewish &quot;Revelation on Sinai&quot;. The forgetting of solidarity &quot;imposed by our common origin and by the equality of rational nature in all men&quot; was called &quot;pernicious error&quot;. Catholics everywhere were called upon to offer &quot;compassion and help&quot; to the victims of the war. The Pope declared determination to work to hasten the return of peace and trust in prayers for justice, love and mercy, to prevail against the scourge of war. The letter also decried the deaths of noncombatants.

Cardinal Secretary of State Luigi Maglione received a request from Chief Rabbi of Palestine Isaac Herzog in the spring of 1940 to intercede on behalf of Lithuanian Jews about to be deported to Germany. Pius called Joachim von Ribbentrop on 11 March, repeatedly protesting against the treatment of Jews. In 1940, Pius asked members of the clergy, on Vatican letterhead, to do whatever they could on behalf of interned Jews.

In 1941, Cardinal Theodor Innitzer of Vienna informed Pius of Jewish deportations in Vienna. Later that year, when asked by the Vichy regime Head of State Philippe Pétain if the Vatican objected to antisemitic laws, Pius responded that the church condemned antisemitism, but would not comment on specific rules. Similarly, when Pétain&#x27;s regime adopted the &quot;Jewish statutes&quot;, the Vichy ambassador to the Vatican, Léon Bérard (a French politician), was told that the legislation did not conflict with Catholic teachings. Valerio Valeri, the nuncio to France, was &quot;embarrassed&quot; when he learned of this publicly from Pétain and personally checked the information with Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione who confirmed the Vatican&#x27;s position. In June 1942, Pius XII personally protested against the mass deportations of Jews from France, ordering the papal nuncio to protest to Pétain against &quot;the inhuman arrests and deportations of Jews&quot;. In September 1941, Pius XII objected to a Slovak Jewish Code, which, unlike the earlier Vichy codes, prohibited intermarriage between Jews and non-Jews. In October 1941, Harold H. Tittmann Jr., a U.S. delegate to the Vatican, asked the Pope to condemn the atrocities against Jews; Pius replied that the Vatican wished to remain &quot;neutral&quot;, reiterating the neutrality policy that Pius had invoked as early as September 1940.

In 1942, the Slovak chargé d&#x27;affaires told Pius that Slovak Jews were being sent to concentration camps. On 11 March 1942, several days before the first transport was due to leave, the chargé d&#x27;affaires in Bratislava reported to the Vatican: &quot;I have been assured that this atrocious plan is the handwork of ... Prime Minister (Tuka), who confirmed the plan ... he dared to tell me—he who makes such a show of his Catholicism—that he saw nothing inhuman or un-Christian in it ... the deportation of 80,000 persons to Poland, is equivalent to condemning a great number of them to certain death.&quot; The Vatican protested to the Slovak government that it &quot;deplore(s) these... measures which gravely hurt the natural human rights of persons, merely because of their race.&quot;

On 18 September 1942, Pius XII received a letter from Monsignor Montini (future Pope Paul VI), saying &quot;the massacres of the Jews reach frightening proportions and forms&quot;. Later that month, Myron Taylor warned Pius that the Vatican&#x27;s &quot;moral prestige&quot; was being injured by silence on European atrocities, a warning that was echoed simultaneously by representatives from the United Kingdom, Brazil, Uruguay, Belgium, and Poland. Myron C. Taylor passed a U.S. Government memorandum to Pius on 26 September 1942, outlining intelligence received from the Jewish Agency for Palestine, which said that Jews from across the Nazi Empire were being systematically &quot;butchered&quot;. Taylor asked if the Vatican might have any information that might &quot;tend to confirm the reports&quot;, and, if so, what the Pope might be able to do to influence public opinion against the &quot;barbarities&quot;.

Cardinal Maglione handed Harold Tittmann a response to the letter on 10 October. The note thanked Washington for passing on the intelligence, and confirmed that reports of severe measures against the Jews had reached the Vatican from other sources, though it had not been possible to &quot;verify their accuracy&quot;. Nevertheless, Maglione stated, &quot;every opportunity is being taken by the Holy See, however, to mitigate the suffering of these unfortunate people&quot;. According to David Kertzer&#x27;s &quot;The Pope at War&quot;, Monsignor Domenico Tardini &quot;told the British envoy to the Vatican in mid-December [1942] that the Pope couldn&#x27;t speak out about Nazi atrocities because the Vatican hadn&#x27;t been able to verify the information&quot;.

In December 1942, when Tittmann asked Cardinal Secretary of State Maglione if Pius would issue a proclamation similar to the Allied declaration &quot;German Policy of Extermination of the Jewish Race&quot;, Maglione replied that the Vatican was &quot;unable to denounce publicly particular atrocities&quot;. Pius XII directly explained to Tittman that he could not name the Nazis without at the same time mentioning the Bolsheviks.

On 14 December 1942, German Jesuit and German resistance activist Lothar König wrote to Reverend Robert Leiber, the Pope&#x27;s private secretary and a liaison to the Resistance, to inform him that his sources had confirmed approximately 6,000 Polish and Jewish people were being killed every day in &quot;SS-furnaces&quot; located in an area of what was then German-occupied Poland and is now part of western Ukraine. It also referenced the Nazi death camps at Auschwitz and Dachau. Giovanni Coco, an archivist in the Vatican Apostolic Archive, said that König urged the Holy See to withhold this information to protect the lives of his sources in the resistance.

Following the Nazi/Soviet invasion of Poland, Pius XII&#x27;s &quot;Summi Pontificatus&quot; called for the sympathy of the whole world towards Poland, where &quot;the blood of countless human beings, even noncombatants&quot; was being spilled. Pius never publicly condemned the Nazi massacre of 1,800,000–1,900,000 Poles, overwhelmingly Catholic (including 2,935 members of the Catholic clergy). In late 1942, Pius XII advised German and Hungarian bishops to speak out against the massacres on the Eastern Front. In his 1942 Christmas Eve message, he expressed concern for &quot;those hundreds of thousands, who ... sometimes only by reason of their nationality or race, are marked down for death or progressive extinction. On 7 April 1943, Msgr. Tardini, one of Pius XII&#x27;s closest advisors, advised Pius XII that it would be politically advantageous after the war to take steps to help Slovak Jews.

In January 1943, Pius XII declined to denounce publicly the Nazi discrimination against the Jews, following requests to do so from Władysław Raczkiewicz, president of the Polish government-in-exile, and Bishop Konrad von Preysing of Berlin. According to Toland, in June 1943, Pius XII addressed the issue of mistreatment of Jews at a conference of the Sacred College of Cardinals and said: &quot;Every word We address to the competent authority on this subject, and all Our public utterances have to be carefully weighed and measured by Us in the interests of the victims themselves, lest, contrary to Our intentions, We make their situation worse and harder to bear&quot;.

On 26 September 1943, following the German occupation of northern Italy, Nazi officials gave Jewish leaders in Rome 36 hours to produce of gold (or the equivalent), threatening to take 300 hostages. Then Chief Rabbi of Rome Israel Zolli recounts in his memoir that he was selected to go to the Vatican and seek help. The Vatican offered to loan 15 kilos, but the offer proved unnecessary when the Jews received an extension. Soon afterward, when deportations from Italy were imminent, 477 Jews were hidden in the Vatican itself and another 4,238 were protected in Roman monasteries and convents. Eighty percent of Roman Jews were saved from deportation. Phayer argues that the German diplomats in Rome were the &quot;initiators of the effort to save the city&#x27;s Jews&quot;, but holds that Pius XII &quot;cooperated in this attempt at rescue&quot;, while agreeing with Zuccotti that the Pope &quot;did not give orders&quot; for any Catholic institution to hide Jews.

On 30 April 1943, Pius XII wrote to Bishop Konrad von Preysing of Berlin to say: &quot;We give to the pastors who are working on the local level the duty of determining if and to what degree the danger of reprisals and of various forms of oppression occasioned by episcopal declarations ... &quot;ad maiora mala vitanda&quot; (to avoid worse) ... seem to advise caution. Here lies one of the reasons, why We impose self-restraint on Ourselves in our speeches; the experience, that we made in 1942 with papal addresses, which We authorized to be forwarded to the Believers, justifies our opinion, as far as We see. ... The Holy See has done whatever was in its power, with charitable, financial and moral assistance. To say nothing of the substantial sums which we spent in American money for the fares of immigrants.&quot;

On 28 October 1943, Ernst von Weizsäcker, the German Ambassador to the Vatican, telegraphed Berlin that &quot;the Pope has not yet let himself be persuaded to make an official condemnation of the deportation of the Roman Jews. ... Since it is currently thought that the Germans will take no further steps against the Jews in Rome, the question of our relations with the Vatican may be considered closed.&quot;

In March 1944, through the papal nuncio in Budapest, Angelo Rotta, the Pope urged the Hungarian government to moderate its treatment of the Jews. The Pope ordered Rotta and other papal legates to hide and shelter Jews. 

After George Mantello, Jewish First Secretary of El Salvador in Switzerland, received the Auschwitz Protocol with much delay around June 22, 1944 he immediately publicized its summary. From about June 24, 1944 in Switzerland that led to large-scale grassroots protests, Sunday masses and about 400 articles in the papers about the barbarism against Europe&#x27;s Jews. These unprecedented events created so much &quot;noise&quot; that it attracted international attention to the large-scale daily deportation of Hungary&#x27;s Jews to Auschwitz since May 1944. Protests by the King of Sweden, the International Red Cross, the United States, Britain and the Vatican forced Hungary&#x27;s Regent Miklos Horthy to order cessation of most deportations of Jews from Hungary to Auschwitz on July 6, 1944 and termination of transports three days later. That saved many of the Jews of Hungary.

In 1944, Pius appealed to 13 Latin American governments to accept &quot;emergency passports&quot;, although it also took the intervention of the United States Department of State for those countries to honor the documents. The Kaltenbrunner Report to Hitler, dated 29 November 1944, against the backdrop of the 20 July 1944 Plot to assassinate Hitler, states that the Pope was somehow a conspirator, specifically naming Eugenio Pacelli (Pope Pius XII), as being a party in the attempt.

====Jewish orphans controversy====

In 2005, &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; published a document dated 20 November 1946 on the subject of Jewish children baptized in war-time France. The document ordered that baptized children, if orphaned, should be kept in Catholic custody and stated that the decision &quot;has been approved by the Holy Father&quot;. Nuncio Angelo Roncalli (who became Pope John XXIII, and was recognized by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations) ignored this directive. Abe Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), who had himself been baptized as a child and had undergone a custody battle afterwards, called for an immediate freeze on Pius&#x27;s beatification process until the relevant Vatican Secret Archives and baptismal records were opened. Two Italian scholars, Matteo Luigi Napolitano and Andrea Tornielli, confirmed that the memorandum was genuine, although the reporting by the &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; was misleading, as the document had originated in the French Catholic Church archives rather than the Vatican archives and strictly concerned itself with children without living blood relatives who were supposed to be handed over to Jewish organizations.

Writings from released Vatican records revealed that Pius XII was personally but secretly involved in hiding the Finaly children from their Jewish family in an ultimately failed attempt to keep them Catholic after their secret baptism done against the wishes of their family. The French Catholic Church received very bad press from the affair, and several nuns and monks were jailed for the kidnapping before the children were discovered and spirited away to Israel. Only recently was the Pope&#x27;s personal involvement revealed.

==Post–World War II==

After World War II, Pope Pius XII focused on material aid to war-torn Europe, an internal internationalization of the Catholic Church, and the development of its worldwide diplomatic relations. His encyclicals, &quot;Evangelii praecones&quot; and &quot;Fidei donum&quot;, issued on 2 June 1951 and 21 April 1957, respectively, increased the local decision-making of Catholic missions, many of which became independent dioceses. Pius XII demanded recognition of local cultures as fully equal to European culture. Though his language retained old conceptions – Africa, for example, merited special attention since the church there worked &#x27;to forward her work among the heathen multitudes&#x27; – in 1956 he expressed solidarity with the &#x27;non-Europeans who aspire to full political independence&#x27;.

In the immediate aftermath of the war, Pius XII elevated a number of high-profile resistors of Nazism to the College of Cardinals in 1946, among them the German Bishops Joseph Frings of Cologne, Clemens von Galen of Münster and Konrad von Preysing of Berlin. From elsewhere in the liberated Nazi Empire Pius selected other resistors: Dutch Archbishop Johannes de Jong; Hungarian Bishop József Mindszenty; Polish Archbishop Adam Stefan Sapieha; and French Archbishop Jules-Géraud Saliège. In 1946 and 1953, respectively, he named as cardinals Thomas Tien Ken-sin of China and Valerian Gracias of India – the first indigenous Catholics of their respective nations to sit in the College of Cardinals. Italian Papal diplomat Angelo Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII) and Polish Archbishop Stefan Wyszyński were others among those elevated in 1953.

A German contingent dominated his inner circle at this period – the German Jesuits Robert Leiber, Wilhelm Hentrich and Ivo Zeiger. His personal confessor Augustin Bea was a German Jesuit and Mother Pascalina Lehnert and the other German speaking sisters of the papal household added to this element. The American bishop Aloisius Muench wrote in November 1948 that Pius XII was &#x27;more interested in affairs of the Church in Germany than in any other part of the Church&#x27; and resolved to make the postwar German crisis a top priority – &#x27;its refugee crisis, poverty, hunger and disease, the fate of prisoners-of-war and accused war criminals, the disruption to the internal organization and communal life of German Catholicism, and Germany&#x27;s uncertain political future&#x27;.

He was concerned too about the potential spread of Communism in Western Europe and the Americas. As he sought to secure resources from abroad to aid post-war recovery, believing deprivation fuelled political agitation, so he also sought to influence Italian politics. In January 1948, Luigi Gedda, of Italy&#x27;s Catholic Action movement, was called to the Vatican as the election campaign for the first parliament of Italy&#x27;s post-fascist republic was underway.

Pius XII was rather distrustful of Alcide de Gasperi and Italy&#x27;s Christian Democrats, considering the party indecisive and fractious – reformist currents within it particularly, which tended to the moderate Left – represented by the Sicilian priest Luigi Sturzo for example – he considered too accommodating to the Left. On the eve of the 1952 local elections in Rome, in which again the Communist and Socialist parties threatened to win out, he used informal connections to make his views known. Pius XII stated that the war against Communism was a holy war and excommunicated members of the Italian Communist Party. Having decided to encourage the Christian Democrats to consider a political alliance with the Rightist parties as part of an anti-left coalition, he asked the Jesuit, Father Riccardo Lombardi, to speak with de Gasperi to consider such an alliance – an electoral alliance with those even of monarchist and neo-fascist tendencies -including the Italian Social Movement. Adopting a domino theory he warned that, if &quot;the Communists win in Rome, in Italy, it will cast a shadow on the entire world: France would become Communist, and then Spain and then all of Europe.&quot;

==Later life, illness and death==
===Late years of Pope Pius XII===

A long illness in late 1954 caused the Pope to consider abdication. Afterwards, changes in his work habit became noticeable. The Pope avoided long ceremonies, canonizations and consistories and displayed hesitancy in personnel matters. He found it increasingly difficult to chastise subordinates and appointees such as his physician, Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi, who after numerous indiscretions was excluded from Papal service for the last years, but, keeping his title, was able to enter the papal apartments to make photos of the dying Pope, which he sold to French magazines. Pius underwent three courses of cellular rejuvenation treatment administered by Paul Niehans, the most important in 1954 when Pius was gravely ill. Side-effects of the treatment included hallucinations, from which the Pope suffered in his last years. &quot;These years were also plagued by horrific nightmares. Pacelli&#x27;s blood-curdling screams could be heard throughout the papal apartments.&quot;

Pius XII often elevated young priests as bishops, such as Julius Döpfner (35 years) and Karol Wojtyła (later Pope John Paul II, 38 years), one of his last appointees in 1958. He took a firm stand against pastoral experiments, such as &quot;worker-priests&quot;, who worked full-time in factories and joined political parties and unions. He continued to defend the theological tradition of Thomism as worthy of continued reform, and as superior to modern trends such as phenomenology or existentialism.

===Illness and death===

With frequent absences from work, Pope Pius XII had come to depend heavily on a few close colleagues, especially his aide Domenico Tardini, his speechwriter Robert Leiber, and his long-serving housekeeper Sister Pascalina Lehnert. The Pope still addressed lay people and groups about a wide range of topics. Sometimes he answered specific moral questions addressed to him. To professional associations he explained specific occupational ethics in light of church teachings. Robert Leiber helped him occasionally with his speeches and publications. Cardinal Augustin Bea was his personal confessor. Sister Pascalina was for forty years his &quot;housekeeper, muse and lifelong companion&quot;.

On Monday, 6 October 1958, at around 8:30 CET (7:30 GMT), he suffered a stroke, weakening him greatly in addition to his other maladies, after having taken ill the previous day after a series of meetings. He received the Last rites. However, his condition suitably improved until 8 October when he suffered a second stroke. By the mid-afternoon, his doctors had reported that Pius XII was suffering from a severe cardio-pulmonary collapse and by 15:00 CET (14:00 GMT) believed that his death was imminent. Just before sunset, Pius XII contracted pneumonia and doctors immediately moved to bring in oxygen and blood plasma. His last words were reportedly, &quot;Pray. Pray that this regrettable situation for the church may end&quot;.

On the last full day of his life, his temperature rose steadily and his breathing became difficult. At 3:52 CET (2:52 GMT) on Thursday, 9 October, a Feast of Saint Denis of Paris, he gave a smile, lowered his head and died. The cause of death was recorded as acute heart failure. Domenico Tardini prayed the &quot;Magnificat Anima mea dominum&quot;, the Virgin Mary&#x27;s praise of the Lord, in Latin. His doctor Gaspanini said afterwards: &quot;The Holy Father did not die because of any specific illness. He was completely exhausted. He was overworked beyond limit. His heart was healthy, his lungs were good. He could have lived another 20 years, had he spared himself.&quot; Spain declared ten days of mourning; Italy declared three days of mourning and the closure of offices and schools as a sign of respect; Cuba declared three days of mourning.

The Testament of Pope Pius XII was published the month of his death.

===Botched embalming===

Pius XII&#x27;s physician, Riccardo Galeazzi-Lisi, reported that the pontiff&#x27;s body was embalmed in the room where he died using a novel process invented by Oreste Nuzzi.

Pope Pius XII did not want the vital organs removed from his body, demanding instead that it be kept in the same condition &quot;in which God created it&quot;. According to Galeazzi-Lisi, this was the reason why he and Nuzzi, an embalmer from Naples, used an atypical approach with the embalming procedure. In a controversial press conference, Galeazzi-Lisi described in great detail the embalming of the body of the late pontiff. He claimed to have used the same system of oils and resins with which the body of Jesus Christ was preserved.

Galeazzi-Lisi asserted that the new process would &quot;preserve the body indefinitely in its natural state&quot;. However, whatever chance the new embalming process had of efficaciously preserving the body was obliterated by intense heat in Castel Gandolfo during the embalming process. As a result, the body decomposed rapidly and the viewing of the faithful had to be terminated abruptly.

Galeazzi-Lisi reported that heat in the halls, where the body of the late Pope lay in state, caused chemical reactions which required it to be treated twice after the original preparation. Swiss Guards stationed around Pius XII&#x27;s body were reported to have become ill during their vigil.

===Funeral===
His funeral procession into Rome was the largest congregation of Romans as of that date. Romans mourned &quot;their&quot; pope, who was born in their own city, especially as a hero in the time of war. Cardinal Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli (later to be Pope John XXIII) wrote in his diary on Saturday, 11 October 1958 that probably no Roman emperor had enjoyed such a triumph, which he viewed as a reflection of the spiritual majesty and religious dignity of the late Pius XII.

When Pius XII was interred, the small crucifix and rosary that he held in his hands as he died were buried with him.

==Cause for canonisation==
Pope Pius XII&#x27;s cause of canonization was opened on 18 November 1965 by Pope Paul VI during the final session of the Second Vatican Council. In May 2007, the congregation recommended that Pius XII should be declared Venerable. Pope Benedict XVI did so on 19 December 2009, simultaneously making the same declaration in regard to Pope John Paul II.

For Venerable status, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints certifies the &quot;heroic virtues&quot; of the candidate. Making Pius XII as Venerable met with various responses, most centered on the papal words and actions during World War II. Benedict&#x27;s signature on the decree of heroic virtue was regarded by some as a public relations blunder, though acceptance of Pius XII as a saviour of Europe&#x27;s Jews is regarded as &#x27;proof of fidelity to the Church, the &quot;pope&quot; and the Tradition&#x27; by neoconservative Catholic groups. On the other hand, Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder and dean at the Simon Wiesenthal Center said &quot;there would be a great distortion of history&quot; if Pius XII were canonized. Rabbi Jeremy Lawrence, the head of Sydney&#x27;s Great Synagogue, said: &quot;How can one venerate a man who ... seemed to give his passive permission to the Nazis as the Jews were prised from his doorstep in Rome?&quot;

On 1 August 2013, an anonymous &quot;source who works for the Congregation for the Causes of Saints&quot; said Pope Francis is considering canonization without a miracle, &quot;us[ing] the formula of &quot;scientia certa&quot;&quot;.

Pope Francis also announced his intention in January 2014 to open the Vatican Secret Archives to scholars so that an evaluation of the late pontiff&#x27;s role in the war can be determined before canonization. This has been met with praise by the Jewish community. However, it was said that it could take up to a year to gather all the documents and then analyze them.

On 26 May 2014 on his way back from the Holy Land to the Vatican City, Pope Francis stated that the late pope would not be beatified because the cause has stalled. Pope Francis stated that he checked the progress of the cause for Pius XII and said that there were no miracles attributed to his intercession, which was the main reason that the cause had halted.

Father Peter Gumpel stated, in a 12 January 2016 documentary on the late pope, that there was consultation of the Vatican Secret Archives which were carried out in secret; in short, it means that there are no controversies surrounding the late pontiff that could impede the potential beatification. In that same documentary, the cause&#x27;s vice-postulator Marc Lindeijer stated that several miracles attributed to the late pope are reported to the postulation every year but the individuals related to the healings do not come forward to enact diocesan proceedings of investigation. Lindeijer explained that this was the reason that the cause has stalled in the past as none have come forward to assist the postulation in their investigations.

===Potential miracle===
Reports from 2014 indicate a potential miracle from the United States attributed to the intercession of the late pope that was reported to the postulation. The miracle pertains to a male plagued with severe influenza and pneumonia that could have proven to be fatal; the individual was said to have been healed in full after a novena to Pius XII.

==Views, interpretations and scholarship==

===Contemporary===
During the war, &quot;Time&quot; credited Pius XII and the Catholic Church for &quot;fighting totalitarianism more knowingly, devoutly and authoritatively, and for a longer time, than any other organised power&quot;. During the war he was also praised editorially by &quot;The New York Times&quot; for opposing Nazi anti-Semitism and aggression. According to Paul O&#x27;Shea, &quot;The Nazis demonised the Pope as the agent of international Jewry; the Americans and British were continually frustrated because he would not condemn Nazi aggression; and the Russians accused him of being an agent of Fascism and the Nazis.&quot;

On 21 September 1945, the general secretary of the World Jewish Congress, Aryeh Leon Kubowitzki, presented an amount of money to the Pope, &quot;in recognition of the work of the Holy See in rescuing Jews from Fascist and Nazi persecutions.&quot; After the war, in the autumn of 1945, Harry Greenstein from Baltimore, a close friend of Chief Rabbi Herzog of Jerusalem, told Pius XII how grateful Jews were for all he had done for them. &quot;My only regret&quot;, the Pope replied, &quot;is not to have been able to save a greater number of Jews&quot;.

Pius XII was also criticised during his lifetime. Leon Poliakov wrote in 1950 that Pius XII had been a tacit supporter of Vichy France&#x27;s anti-Semitic laws, calling him &quot;less forthright&quot; than Pope Pius XI either out of &quot;Germanophilia&quot; or the hope that Hitler would defeat Communist Russia.

After Pius XII&#x27;s death on 9 October 1958 many Jewish organisations and newspapers around the world paid tribute to his legacy. At the United Nations, Golda Meir, Israel&#x27;s Foreign Minister, said, &quot;When fearful martyrdom came to our people in the decade of Nazi terror, the voice of the Pope was raised for the victims. The life of our times was enriched by a voice speaking out on the great moral truths above the tumult of daily conflict.&quot; &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; (London) stated on 10 October, &quot;Adherents of all creeds and parties will recall how Pius XII faced the responsibilities of his exalted office with courage and devotion. Before, during, and after the Second World War, he constantly preached the message of peace. Confronted by the monstrous cruelties of Nazism, Fascism and Communism, he repeatedly proclaimed the virtues of humanity and compassion.&quot; In the Canadian Jewish Chronicle (17 October), Rabbi J. Stern stated that Pius XII &quot;made it possible for thousands of Jewish victims of Nazism and Fascism to be hidden away...&quot; In 6 November edition of &quot;The Jewish Post &amp; News&quot; in Winnipeg, William Zukerman, the former &quot;The American Hebrew&quot; columnist, wrote that no other leader &quot;did more to help the Jews in their hour of greatest tragedy, during the Nazi occupation of Europe, than the late Pope&quot;. Other prominent Jewish figures, such as Israeli Prime Minister Moshe Sharett and Chief Rabbi Isaac Herzog expressed their public gratitude to Pius XII.

===Early historical accounts===
Some early works echoed the favourable sentiments of the war period, including Polish historian Oskar Halecki&#x27;s &quot;Pius XII: Eugenio Pacelli: Pope of peace&quot; (1954) and Nazareno Padellaro&#x27;s &quot;Portrait of Pius XII&quot; (1949).

Pinchas Lapide, a Jewish theologian and Israeli diplomat to Milan in the 1960s, estimated controversially in &quot;Three Popes and the Jews&quot; that Pius &quot;was instrumental in saving at least 700,000 but probably as many as 860,000 Jews from certain death at Nazi hands&quot;. Some historians have questioned this often cited number, which Lapide reached by &quot;deducting all reasonable claims of rescue&quot; by non-Catholics from the total number of European Jews surviving the Holocaust. A Catholic scholar, Kevin J. Madigan, has interpreted this and other praise from prominent Jewish leaders, including that offered by Golda Meir, as less than sincere, an attempt to secure Vatican recognition of the State of Israel.

===&quot;The Deputy&quot;===

In 1963, Rolf Hochhuth&#x27;s controversial drama &quot;Der Stellvertreter. Ein christliches Trauerspiel&quot; (&quot;The Deputy, a Christian tragedy&quot;, released in English in 1964) portrayed Pope Pius XII as a hypocrite who remained silent about the Holocaust. The depiction is described as lacking &quot;credible substantiation&quot; by the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;. Books such as Joseph Lichten&#x27;s &quot;A Question of Judgment&quot; (1963), written in response to &quot;The Deputy&quot;, defended Pius XII&#x27;s actions during the war. Lichten labelled any criticism of the Pope&#x27;s actions during World War II as &quot;a stupefying paradox&quot; and said, &quot;no one who reads the record of Pius XII&#x27;s actions on behalf of Jews can subscribe to Hochhuth&#x27;s accusation&quot;. Critical scholarly works like Guenter Lewy&#x27;s controversial &quot;The Catholic Church and Nazi Germany&quot; (1964) also followed the publication of &quot;The Deputy&quot;. Lewy&#x27;s conclusion was that &quot;the Pope and his advisers—influenced by the long tradition of moderate anti-Semitism so widely accepted in Vatican circles—did not view the plight of the Jews with a real sense of urgency and moral outrage. For this assertion no documentation is possible, but it is a conclusion difficult to avoid&quot;. In 2002 the play was adapted into the film, &quot;Amen.&quot;. An article in &quot;La Civilità Cattolica&quot; in March 2009 indicated the accusations that Hochhuth&#x27;s play made widely known originated not among Jews but in the Communist bloc. It was on Moscow Radio, on 2 June 1945, that the first accusation directly against Pius XII of refusing to speak out against the exterminations in Nazi concentration camps. It was also the first medium to call him &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Pope&quot;.

The former high-ranking Securitate General Ion Mihai Pacepa alleged in 2007 that Hochhuth&#x27;s play and numerous publications attacking Pius XII as a Nazi sympathizer were fabrications that were part of a KGB and Eastern Bloc secret services disinformation campaign, named Seat 12, to discredit the moral authority of the Church and Christianity in the West. Pacepa indicated that he was involved in contacting Eastern Bloc agents close the Vatican in order to fabricate the story to be used for the attack against the wartime pope.

===&quot;Actes&quot;===

In the aftermath of the controversy surrounding &quot;The Deputy&quot;, in 1964, Pope Paul VI authorized Jesuit scholars to access the Vatican State Secretariat Archives, which are normally not opened for seventy-five years. Original documents in French and Italian, &quot;Actes et documents du Saint Siège relatifs à la Seconde Guerre Mondiale&quot;, were published in eleven volumes between 1965 and 1981. Pierre Blet also published a summary of the eleven volumes.

===&quot;Hitler&#x27;s Pope&quot; and &quot;The Myth of Hitler&#x27;s Pope&quot;===

In 1999, British author John Cornwell&#x27;s &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Pope&quot; criticised Pius XII for his actions and inactions during the Holocaust. Cornwell argued that Pius XII subordinated opposition to the Nazis to his goal of increasing and centralising the power of the Papacy. Further, Cornwell accused Pius XII of anti-Semitism. The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; described Cornwell&#x27;s depiction of Pius XII as anti-Semitic as lacking &quot;credible substantiation&quot;. Kenneth L. Woodward stated in his review in &quot;Newsweek&quot; that &quot;errors of fact and ignorance of context appear on almost every page&quot;. Paul O&#x27;Shea summarized the work by saying it was &quot;disappointing because of its many inaccuracies, selective use of sources, and claims that do not bear any scrutiny. However, [Cornwell] has rendered a service by insisting Pacelli be re-examined thoroughly and placed firmly within the context of his times&quot;. Five years after the publication of &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Pope&quot;, Cornwell stated: &quot;I would now argue, in the light of the debates and evidence following &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Pope&quot;, that Pius XII had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war, while Rome was under the heel of Mussolini and later occupied by Germany&quot;.

Cornwell&#x27;s work was the first to have access to testimonies from Pius XII&#x27;s beatification process as well as to many documents from Pacelli&#x27;s nunciature which had just been opened under the 75-year rule by the Vatican State Secretary archives. Susan Zuccotti&#x27;s &quot;Under His Very Windows: The Vatican and the Holocaust in Italy&quot; (2000) and Michael Phayer&#x27;s &quot;The Catholic Church and the Holocaust, 1930–1965&quot; (2000) and &quot;Pius XII, The Holocaust, and the Cold War&quot; (2008) provided further critical, though more scholarly analysis of Pius&#x27;s legacy. Daniel Goldhagen&#x27;s &quot;A Moral Reckoning&quot; and David Kertzer&#x27;s &quot;The Pope Against the Jews&quot; denounced Pius, while Ralph McInery and José Sanchez wrote less critical assessments of Pius XII&#x27;s pontificate.

In specific riposte to Cornwell&#x27;s criticism, American Rabbi and historian David Dalin published &quot;The Myth of Hitler&#x27;s Pope: How Pope Pius XII Rescued Jews from the Nazis&quot; in 2005. He reaffirmed previous accounts of Pius having been a saviour of thousands of Europe&#x27;s Jews. In a review of the book, another Jewish scholar—Churchill biographer, Martin Gilbert—wrote that Dalin&#x27;s work was &quot;an essential contribution to our understanding of the reality of Pope Pius XII&#x27;s support for Jews at their time of greatest danger. Hopefully, his account will replace the divisively harmful version of papal neglect, and even collaboration, that has held the field for far too long&quot;. Dalin&#x27;s book also argued that Cornwell and others were liberal Catholics and ex-Catholics who &quot;exploit the tragedy of the Jewish people during the Holocaust to foster their own political agenda of forcing changes on the Catholic Church today&quot; and that Pius XII was responsible for saving the lives of many thousands of Jews.

A number of other scholars replied with favourable accounts of Pius XII, including Margherita Marchione&#x27;s &quot;Yours Is a Precious Witness: Memoirs of Jews and Catholics in Wartime Italy&quot; (1997), &quot;Pope Pius XII: Architect for Peace&quot; (2000) and &quot;Consensus and Controversy: Defending Pope Pius XII&quot; (2002); Pierre Blet&#x27;s &quot;Pius XII and the Second World War, According to the Archives of the Vatican&quot; (1999); and Ronald J. Rychlak&#x27;s &quot;Hitler, the War and the Pope&quot; (2000). Ecclesiastical historian William Doino (author of &quot;The Pius War: Responses to the Critics of Pius XII&quot;), concluded that Pius was &quot;emphatically &quot;not&quot; silent&quot;. Other important works challenging the negative characterization of Pius&#x27;s legacy were written by Eamon Duffy, Clifford Longley, Cardinal Winning, Michael Burleigh, Paul Johnson, and Denis Mack Smith.

In his 2003 book &quot;A Moral Reckoning&quot;, Daniel Goldhagen asserted that Pius XII &quot;chose again and again not to mention the Jews publicly... [In] public statements by Pius XII ... any mention of the Jews is conspicuously absent.&quot; In a review of Goldhagen&#x27;s book, Mark Riebling counters that Pius used the word &quot;Jew&quot; in his first encyclical, &quot;Summi Pontificatus&quot;, published on 20 October 1939. &quot;There Pius insisted that all human beings be treated charitably—for, as Paul had written to the Colossians, in God&#x27;s eyes &quot;there is neither Gentile nor Jew&quot;. In saying this, the Pope affirmed that Jews were full members of the human community—which is Goldhagen&#x27;s own criterion for establishing &#x27;dissent from the anti-Semitic creed&#x27;.&quot;

In &quot;Pius XII, the Hound of Hitler&quot;, Catholic journalist Gerard Noel dismissed accusations that Pius was &quot;anti-semitic&quot; or &quot;pro-Nazi&quot;, but accused him of &quot;silence&quot; based on fear of retaliation and wrote that &quot;Hitler played the Pope with consummate expertise&quot;. Ian Kershaw came to a similar conclusion about Pius&#x27;s motives. He suggested that besides seeking to protect his own church and parishioners, Pius feared that speaking out would worsen the plight of the Jews, though he could have hardly made it worse after 1942. Kershaw called the 1942 Christmas message &quot;a missed opportunity&quot;, adding: &quot;Having decided to refer to the genocide, Pius ought to have followed this with a condemnation that was loud, plain and unequivocal.&quot; However, he doubted that condemnation from the Pope would have led to Nazi Germany changing course.

Gerald Steinacher&#x27;s &quot;Nazis on the Run&quot; accused Pius of turning a blind eye to the activities of Vatican priests assisting &quot;denazification through conversion&quot;, which he said helped ex-Nazi anti-communists to escape justice.

A Berlin Jewish couple, Mr. and Mrs. Wolfsson, argued in defense of the pope: &quot;None of us wanted the Pope to take an open stand. We were all fugitives, and fugitives do not wish to be pointed at. The Gestapo would have become more excited and would have intensified its inquisitions. If the Pope had protested, Rome would have become the center of attention. It was better that the Pope said nothing. We all shared this opinion at the time, and this is still our conviction today.&quot; There were examples when the Catholic Church reaction to Nazi brutality only intensified SS persecutions of both Jews and the church.

===International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission===

In 1999, in an attempt to address some of this controversy, the International Catholic-Jewish Historical Commission (Historical Commission), a group of three Catholic and three Jewish scholars was appointed, respectively, by the Holy See&#x27;s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews (Holy See&#x27;s Commission) and the International Jewish Committee for Interreligious Consultations (IJCIC), to whom a preliminary report was issued in October 2000.

The Commission did not discover any documents, but had the agreed-upon task to review the existing Vatican volumes, that make up the &quot;Actes et Documents du Saint Siège (ADSS)&quot; The commission was internally divided over the question of access to additional documents from the Holy See, access to the news media by individual commission members, and, questions to be raised in the preliminary report. It was agreed to include all 47 individual questions by the six members, and use them as Preliminary Report.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerard P Fogarty, Vatican/Holocaust&quot;&gt;Fogarty, Gerard P., &quot;The Vatican and the Holocaust, Presentation to the Dominican House of Studies, Washington, D.C.&quot;, 9 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the 47 questions, the commission issued no findings of its own. It stated that it was not their task to sit in judgment of the Pope and his advisors but to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the papacy during the Holocaust.

The 47 questions by the six scholars were grouped into three parts: (a) 27 specific questions on existing documents, mostly asking for background and additional information such as drafts of the encyclical &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot;, which was largely written by Eugenio Pacelli. (b) Fourteen questions dealt with themes of individual volumes, such as the question how Pius viewed the role of the church during the war. (c) Six general questions, such as the absence of any anti-communist sentiments in the documents. The disagreement between members over additional documents locked up under the Holy See&#x27;s 70-year rule resulted in a discontinuation of the commission in 2001 on friendly terms. Unsatisfied with the findings, Michael Marrus, one of the three Jewish members of the commission, said the commission &quot;ran up against a brick wall ... It would have been really helpful to have had support from the Holy See on this issue.&quot;

Peter Stanford, a Catholic journalist and writer, wrote, regarding &quot;Fatal Silence: The Pope, the Resistance and the German Occupation of Rome&quot; (written by Robert Katz; Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, 2003):

Katz&#x27;s book also discusses how the Pope&#x27;s view of the anti-Nazi resistance—as harbingers of Communism—meant he chose not to intervene in the Ardeatine massacre.

==Recent developments==
In &quot;The Real Odessa: How Peron Brought the Nazi War Criminals to Argentina&quot; (2002), the Argentine journalist Uki Goñi described how the Argentinian government dealt with war criminals who entered Argentina. However, during his research Goñi accidentally stumbled on British Foreign Office documents relating to the involvement of Vatican personnel in the smuggling of war criminals, the so-called post-war &quot;ratlines&quot;. Goñi found out that the British Envoy D&#x27;Arcy Osborne had intervened with Pope Pius XII to put an end to these illegal activities. Furthermore, he discovered &quot;that the Pope secretly pleaded with Washington and London on behalf of notorious criminals and Nazi collaborators&quot;. Suzanne Brown-Fleming&#x27;s &quot;The Holocaust and Catholic Conscience: Cardinal Aloisius Muench and the Guilt Question in Germany&quot; (2006) underlines Goñi&#x27;s findings. Brown-Fleming stated how Pius XII allegedly intervened on behalf of German war criminals (e.g. Otto Ohlendorf). Brown-Fleming&#x27;s main source was the archive of Pope Pius XII&#x27;s representative in post-war Germany, Cardinal Aloisius Joseph Muench. Then, Phayer&#x27;s &quot;Pius XII, the Holocaust, and the Cold War&quot; (2008) utilized documents that were released via Bill Clinton&#x27;s 1997 executive order declassifying wartime and postwar documents, many of which are currently at the US National Archives and Holocaust Memorial Museum. These documents include diplomatic correspondence, American espionage, and decryptions of German communications. Relevant documents have also been released by the Argentine government and the British Foreign Office. Other information sources have become available, including the diary of Bishop Joseph Patrick Hurley. These documents reveal new information about Pius XII&#x27;s actions regarding the Ustaše regime, the genocides in Poland, the finances of the wartime church, the deportation of the Roman Jews, and the ratlines for Nazis and fascists fleeing Europe. According to Phayer, &quot;the face of Pope Pius that we see in these documents is not the same face we see in the eleven volumes the Vatican published of World War II documents, a collection which, though valuable, is nonetheless critically flawed because of its many omissions&quot;.

On 19 September 2008, Pope Benedict XVI held a reception for conference participants during which he praised Pius XII as a pope who made every effort to save Jews during the war. A second conference was held from 6–8 November 2008 by the Pontifical Academy of Life.

On 9 October 2008, the 50th anniversary of Pius XII&#x27;s death, Benedict XVI celebrated pontifical Mass in his memory. Shortly before and after the Mass, dialectics continued between the Jewish hierarchy and the Vatican as Rabbi She&#x27;ar Yashuv Cohen of Haifa addressed the Synod of Bishops and expressed his disappointment towards Pius XII&#x27;s &quot;silence&quot; during the war.

On 16 June 2009, the &quot;Pave the Way Foundation&quot; announced that it would release 2,300 pages of documents in Avellino, Italy, dating from 1940 to 1945, which the organisation claims show that Pius XII &quot;worked diligently to save Jews from Nazi tyranny&quot;; the organisation&#x27;s founder, Krupp, has accused historians of harbouring &quot;private agendas&quot; and having &quot;let down&quot; the public. The foundation&#x27;s research led to the publication of the book &quot;Pope Pius XII and World War II: the documented truth&quot;, authored by Krupp; the book reproduces 225 pages of the new documents produced by the foundation&#x27;s research.

Mark Riebling argued in his 2015 book &quot;Church of Spies&quot; that Pius XII was involved in plots to overthrow Hitler from mid-October 1939 and was prepared to mediate a peace between the Allies and the Axis in the event of a regime change in Germany. The courier between the resistance group under Admiral Wilhelm Canaris and the Pope was the Bavarian lawyer and Catholic politician Joseph Müller.

=== Opening of the Vatican Secret Archives ===
On the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the appointment of Pius XII as Bishop of Rome, Pope Francis announced during an audience for staff of the Vatican Secret Archives on 4 March 2019 that Vatican archival materials pertaining to Pius XII&#x27;s pontificate will be accessible to scholars beginning on 2 March 2020. While this announcement was welcome by researchers, much of it has been clouded by the role of Pope Pius XII with regard to the Holocaust. However, archival research of this period should inform a much broader shift within global Christianity, from Europe to the global South.

The Vatican archives have provided many millions of pages and it is expected to take many years to process the findings. As of May 2021, the study of the archive has been inconclusive. In January 2022, historian Michael F. Feldkamp announced that he had discovered in the Vatican archives evidence that Pius XII had personally saved at least 15,000 Jews from extermination, and that he had sent a report on the Holocaust to the American government shortly after the Wannsee Conference, although they did not believe the pope.

In June 2022, David Kertzer, one of the first historians to have analyzed the archives, published his book &quot;The Pope at War&quot;. Kertzer, with the support of thousands of unpublished documents, uncovered the existence of secret negotiations between Hitler and Pius XII already a few weeks after the end of the conclave, promoted by Hitler himself with the intention of improving his relations with the Vatican. For his part, Pius XII concentrated his efforts on protecting and improving the situation of the Church in Germany in the face of the anti-Catholic policies of the Nazis, although no agreement was reached.

In September 2023, &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot; published a newly discovered documentation from the Vatican Secret Archive showing that a German Jesuit had informed the Pope of the Holocaust.

The archives have also demonstrated that Pope Pius XII had knowledge of Marcial Maciel&#x27;s accusations of crimes, including sexual abuse of seminarians and drug abuse, before action was taken. The Vatican apparently knew of Rev. Maciel&#x27;s crimes for 50 years.

<text>Pope John II (; 475 – 8 May 535), born Mercurius, was the Bishop of Rome from 2 January 533 to his death. As a priest at St. Clement&#x27;s Basilica, he endowed that church with gifts and commissioned stone carvings for it. Mercurius became the first pope to adopt a new papal name upon his elevation to the office. During his pontificate, John II notably removed Bishop Contumeliosus of Riez from his office, convened a council on the readmission of Arian clergy, and approved an edict of emperor Justinian, promulgating doctrine opposed by his predecessor, Pope Hormisdas.

== Early life ==

Mercurius was born in Rome, son of Praeiectus. He became a priest at St. Clement&#x27;s Basilica on the Caelian Hill, and even before becoming pope he had commissioned work for the basilica and made generous donations. The basilica still retains memorials of &quot;Johannes surnamed Mercurius&quot;; he donated plutei and transennae. A reference to &quot;Presbyter Mercurius&quot; is found on a fragment of an ancient ciborium. Several marble slabs that enclose the &quot;schola cantorum&quot; bear upon them, in the style of the sixth century, his monogram.

==Pontificate==
Mercurius was elected pope on 2 January 533, apparently the first pope to adopt a new name upon elevation to the papacy.

The notoriously adulterous behavior of Bishop Contumeliosus of Riez caused John to order the bishops of Gaul to confine him in a monastery. Until a new bishop could be appointed, he bade the clergy of Riez to obey the Bishop of Arles.

Stemming from Pope Hormisdas&#x27; suppression of the statement &quot;one of the Trinity suffered in the flesh&quot; in Scythian monastic liturgies, the Acoemetae, or Sleepless Monks, began to support Nestorianism, the belief that Jesus is neither human nor divine. Emperor Justinian I and patriarch Epiphanius of Constantinople opposed this ideology and sent a deputation to Rome which prompted John II to assemble a synod, excommunicate the Acoemetae, and to issue statements approving the doctrine of the emperor.

=== Arianism ===
In 535, 217 bishops assembled in a council at Carthage submitted to John II a decision about whether bishops who had lapsed into Arianism should, on repentance, keep their rank or be admitted only to lay communion. The question of re-admittance to the lapsed troubled North Africa for centuries (see Novatianism and Donatism). The answer to their question was given by Agapetus I, as John II died on 8 May 535. He was buried in St Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

<text>Pope Agapetus I (489/490 – 22 April 536) was the bishop of Rome from 13 May 535 to his death. His father, Gordianus, was a priest in Rome and he may have been related to two popes, Felix III and Gregory I.

In 536, Agapetus traveled to Constantinople at the behest of King Theodahad of the Ostrogoths and unsuccessfully tried to persuade Emperor Justinian I to call off a Byzantine invasion of the Ostrogoth kingdom. While in Constantinople, Agapetus also deposed the patriarch Anthimus I and personally consecrated his successor who is Menas of Constantinople. Four of Agapetus’ letters from this period have survived: two addressed to Justinian, one to the bishops of Africa, and one to the Bishop of Carthage.

Agapetus was canonized in both the Catholic and Orthodox traditions; his feast day is April 22.

== Family ==
Agapetus was born in Rome, although his exact date of birth is unknown. He was the son of Gordianus, a Roman priest who had been slain during the riots in the days of Pope Symmachus (term 498–514). The name of his father might point to a familial relation with popes: Felix III (483–492) and Gregory I (590–604).

== Pontificate==

Jeffrey Richards describes him as &quot;the last survivor of the Symmachan old guard&quot;, having been ordained as a deacon perhaps as early as 502, during the Laurentian schism. He was elevated from archdeacon to pope in 535. His first official act was to burn, in the presence of the assembled clergy, the anathema which Boniface II had pronounced against the latter&#x27;s deceased rival Dioscurus on a false charge of simony and had ordered to be preserved in the Roman archives.

Agapetus assisted Cassiodorus in the founding of his monastery at Vivarium. He confirmed the decrees of the Council of Carthage, after the retaking of North Africa from the Vandals, according to which converts from Arianism were declared ineligible to Holy Orders and those already ordained were merely admitted to lay communion. He accepted an appeal from Contumeliosus, Bishop of Riez, whom the Council of Marseilles had condemned for immorality, and he ordered Caesarius of Arles to grant the accused a new trial before papal delegates.

Meanwhile, the Byzantine general Belisarius was preparing for an invasion of Italy. King Theodahad of the Ostrogoths begged Agapetus to proceed on an embassy to Constantinople and use his personal influence to appease Emperor Justinian I following the death of Amalasuntha. To defray the costs of the embassy, Agapetus pledged the sacred vessels of the Church of Rome. He set out in mid-winter with five bishops and a large retinue. In February 536, he appeared in the capital of the East. Justinian declined to call a halt to the planned invasion as preparations were far too advanced. Agapetus immediately turned his attention from the political matter Theodahad had sent him to address to a religious one.

The occupant of the Byzantine patriarchal see was Anthimus I, who had left his episcopal see of Trebizond. Against the protests of the orthodox, the Empress Theodora finally seated Anthimus in the patriarchal chair. When Agapetus arrived members of the clergy entered charges against Anthimus as an intruder and a heretic. Agapetus ordered him to make a written profession of faith and to return to his forsaken see; upon Anthimus&#x27; refusal, Agapetus deposed him. The Emperor threatened Agapetus with banishment. Agapetus is said to have replied, &quot;With eager longing have I come to gaze upon the Most Christian Emperor Justinian. In his place I find a Diocletian, whose threats, however, terrify me not.&quot; Agapetus, for the first time in the history of the Church, personally consecrated Anthimus&#x27; legally elected successor, Menas.
Justinian delivered to the Pope a written confession of faith, which the latter accepted with the proviso that &quot;although he could not admit in a layman the right of teaching religion, yet he observed with pleasure that the zeal of the Emperor was in perfect accord with the decisions of the Fathers&quot;. Four of Agapetus&#x27; letters have survived. Two are addressed to Justinian in reply to a letter from the emperor, in the latter of which Agapetus refuses to acknowledge the Orders of the Arians. A third is addressed to the bishops of Africa, on the same subject. The fourth is a response to Reparatus, Bishop of Carthage, who had sent him congratulations upon his elevation to the Pontificate.
Shortly afterwards, Agapetus fell ill and died on 22 April 536, after a reign of just ten months. His remains were brought in a lead coffin to Rome and deposited in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. On the Clivus Scauri the archeological remains known as the &#x27;apsidal Hall of the Library of Pope Agapitus I&#x27; is located near the ancient Church of St. Andrew on the Caelian Hill.

== Veneration ==
Agapetus I has been canonised by both the Catholic and Orthodox traditions. The &quot;Roman Martyrology&quot; commemorates him on 22 April, the day of his death, as do the Eastern churches, but some Catholic sources list his feast day as 20 September, the date of his deposition.

<doc id="23811" wikidata="Q104467" url="?curid=23811" title="Pope Agatho">
<text>Pope Agatho (577 – 10 January 681) served as the bishop of Rome from 27 June 678 until his death. He heard the appeal of Wilfrid of York, who had been displaced from his see by the division of the archdiocese ordered by Theodore of Canterbury. During Agatho&#x27;s tenure, the Sixth Ecumenical Council was convened to deal with monothelitism. He is venerated as a saint by both the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. He is said to have been the longest lived Pope ever.

==Early life==
Little is known of Agatho before his papacy but he may have been among the many Sicilian clergy in Rome at that time, due to the Caliphate&#x27;s attacks on Sicily in the mid-7th century. He served several years as treasurer of the church of Rome. He succeeded Donus in the pontificate.

==Papacy==

Shortly after Agatho became pope, Bishop Wilfrid of York arrived in Rome to invoke the authority of the Holy See on his behalf. Wilfrid had been deposed from his see by Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury, who had carved up Wilfrid&#x27;s diocese and appointed three bishops to govern the new sees. At a synod which Pope Agatho convoked in the Lateran to investigate the affair, it was decided that Wilfrid&#x27;s diocese should indeed be divided, but that Wilfrid himself should name the bishops.

The major event of his pontificate was the Sixth Ecumenical Council (680–681), following the end of the Muslim Siege of Constantinople, which suppressed Monothelitism, which had been tolerated by previous popes (Honorius I among them). The council began when Emperor Constantine IV, wanting to heal the schism that separated the two sides, wrote to Pope Donus suggesting a conference on the matter, but Donus was dead by the time the letter arrived. Agatho was quick to seize the olive branch offered by the Emperor. He ordered councils held throughout the West so that legates could present the universal tradition of the Western Church. Then he sent a large delegation to meet the Easterners at Constantinople.

The legates and patriarchs gathered in the imperial palace on 7 November 680. The Monothelites presented their case. Then a letter of Pope Agatho was read that explained the traditional belief of the Church that Christ was of two wills, divine and human. Patriarch George of Constantinople accepted Agatho&#x27;s letter, as did most of the bishops present. The council proclaimed the existence of the two wills in Christ and condemned Monothelitism, with Pope Honorius I being included in the condemnation. When the council ended in September 681 the decrees were sent to the Pope, but Agatho had died in January. The council had not only ended Monothelism, but also had healed the schism.

Agatho also undertook negotiations between the Holy See and Constantine IV concerning the interference of the Byzantine court in papal elections. Constantine promised Agatho to abolish or reduce the tax that the popes had to pay to the imperial treasury on their consecration.

===Age===
Church records state that Agatho served as pope as a centenarian, dying between the ages of 106–107. 2020s research has cast doubt on his age, with many people claiming that Pope Agatho and the monk &quot;Agathon&quot; have been confused, and are two different people.

==Veneration==
Anastatius says that the number of his miracles procured him the title of &quot;Thaumaturgus&quot;. He died in 681, having held the pontificate about two and a half years. He is venerated as a saint by both Catholics and Eastern Orthodox. His feast day in Western Christianity is on 10 January. Eastern Christians, including Eastern Orthodox and the Eastern Catholic Churches, commemorate him on 20 February.

<text>Pope-elect Stephen (died 25 March 752) was a Roman priest selected in March 752 to succeed Pope Zachary. Because he died before he was consecrated, he is considered only a rather than a legitimate pope.

==Election to the Papacy==
In 745, Stephen was made a cardinal-priest by Pope Zachary. His titular church was San Crisogono. Zachary died in mid-March 752. On 23 March, Stephen was selected to become the new pope. He died of a stroke only days later, before being consecrated as bishop of Rome. 

According to the canon law of the time, a pope&#x27;s pontificate started upon his consecration. Later canon law considered that a man became pope the moment he accepted his election, and Pope-elect Stephen was then anachronistically called Pope Stephen II. His name was removed from the list of popes in the &quot;Annuario Pontificio&quot; in 1961.

<text>Pope Stephen II (; 714 – 26 April 757) was born a Roman aristocrat and member of the Orsini family. Stephen was the bishop of Rome from 26 March 752 to his death. Stephen II marks the historical delineation between the Byzantine Papacy and the Frankish Papacy. During Stephen&#x27;s pontificate, Rome was facing invasion by the Lombards when Stephen II went to Paris to seek assistance from Pepin the Short. Pepin defeated the Lombards and made a gift of land to the pope, eventually leading to the establishment of the Papal States.

==Election==
In 751, the Lombard king Aistulf captured the Exarchate of Ravenna, and turned his attention to the Duchy of Rome. Stephen, a Roman aristocrat and member of the Orsini family, was selected on 26 March 752 to succeed Pope Zachary following the recent death of Pope-elect Stephen. 

==Lombard threat==
Relations were very strained in the mid-8th century between the papacy and the Eastern Roman emperors over the support of the Isaurian dynasty for iconoclasm. Likewise, maintaining political control over Rome became untenable as the Eastern Roman Empire itself was beset by the Abbasid Caliphate to the south and Bulgars to the northwest. Constantinople could send no troops, and Emperor Constantine V Copronymus, in answer to the repeated requests for help of the new pope, Stephen II, could only offer him the advice to act in accordance with the ancient policy of Rome, to pit some other Germanic tribe against the Lombards.

Stephen turned to Pepin the Short, the king of the Franks who had recently defeated the Muslim Umayyad invasion of Gaul. He traveled to Paris to plead for help in person against the surrounding Lombard and Muslim threats. On 6 January 754, Stephen re-consecrated Pepin as king. In return, Pepin assumed the role of ordained protector of the Church and set his sights on the Lombards, as well as addressing the threat of Islamic Al-Andalus. Pepin invaded Italy twice to settle the Lombard problem and delivered the territory between Rome and Ravenna to the papacy, but left the Lombard kings in possession of their kingdom.

==Duchy of Rome and the Papal States==

Prior to Stephen II&#x27;s alliance with Pepin, Rome had constituted the central city of the Duchy of Rome, which composed one of two districts within the Exarchate of Ravenna, along with Ravenna itself. At Quiercy the Frankish nobles finally gave their consent to a campaign in Lombardy. Catholic tradition asserts that then and there Pepin executed in writing a promise to give to the Church certain territories that were to be wrested from the Lombards, and which would be referred to later as the Papal States. Known as the Donation of Pepin, no actual document has been preserved, but later 8th century sources quote from it.

Stephen anointed Pepin as king of the Franks at Saint-Denis in a memorable ceremony that was evoked in the coronation rites of French kings until the end of the &quot;ancien régime&quot; in 1789. In return, in 756, Pepin and his Frankish army forced the Lombard king to surrender his conquests, and Pepin officially conferred upon the pope the territories belonging to Ravenna, even cities such as Forlì with their hinterlands, laying the Donation of Pepin upon the tomb of Saint Peter, according to traditional later accounts. The gift included Lombard conquests in the Romagna and in the duchies of Spoleto and Benevento, and the Pentapolis in the Marche (the &quot;five cities&quot; of Rimini, Pesaro, Fano, Senigallia and Ancona). For the first time, the Donation made the pope a temporal ruler over a strip of territory that extended diagonally across Italy from the Tyrrhenian to the Adriatic. Over these extensive and mountainous territories the medieval popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty, given the pressures of the times, and the new Papal States preserved the old Lombard heritage of many small counties and marquisates, each centered upon a fortified &quot;rocca&quot;.

Pepin confirmed his Donation in Rome in 756, and in 774 Charlemagne confirmed the donation of his father. Stephen II died on 26 April 757 and was succeeded by his brother Paul I.

<doc id="23815" wikidata="Q243811" url="?curid=23815" title="Pope Joan">
<text>Pope Joan (Ioannes Anglicus, 855–857) is a legend about a woman who purportedly reigned as pope for two years during the Middle Ages. Her story first appeared in chronicles in the 13th century and subsequently spread throughout Europe. The story was widely believed for centuries, but most modern scholars regard it as fictional.

Most versions of her story describe her as a talented and learned woman who disguised herself as a man, often at the behest of a lover. In the most common accounts, owing to her abilities she rose through the church hierarchy and was eventually elected pope. Her sex was revealed when she gave birth during a procession and she died shortly after, either through murder or natural causes. The accounts state that later church processions avoided this spot and that the Vatican removed the female pope from its official lists and crafted a ritual to ensure that future popes were male. In the 16th century, Siena Cathedral featured a bust of Joan among other pontiffs; this was removed after protests in 1600.

Jean de Mailly&#x27;s chronicle, written around 1250, contains the first mention of an unnamed female pope and inspired several more accounts over the next several years. The most popular and influential version is that interpolated into Martin of Opava&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum&quot; later in the 13th century. Martin introduced details that the female pope&#x27;s birth name was John Anglicus of Mainz, that she reigned in the 9th century and that she entered the church to follow her lover. The existence of Pope Joan was used in the defence of Walter Brut in his trial of 1391. The legend was generally accepted as true until the 16th century, when a widespread debate among Catholic and Protestant writers called the story into question: various writers noted the implausibly long gap between Joan&#x27;s supposed lifetime and her first appearance in texts. Protestant scholar David Blondel ultimately demonstrated the impossibility of the story. Pope Joan is now widely considered fictional, though the legend remains influential in cultural depictions.

The earliest mention of a female pope appears in the Dominican Jean de Mailly&#x27;s chronicle of Metz, &quot;Chronica Universalis Mettensis&quot;, written in the early 13th century. In his telling the female pope is not named and the events are set in 1099. According to Jean:

Jean de Mailly&#x27;s story was picked up by his fellow Dominican Stephen of Bourbon, who adapted it for his work on the &quot;Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost&quot;. However the legend gained its greatest prominence when it appeared in the third &quot;recension&quot; (edited revision) of Martin of Opava&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon Pontificum et Imperatorum&quot; later in the 13th century. This version, which may have been by Martin himself, is the first to attach a name to the figure, indicating that she was known as John Anglicus or John of Mainz. It also changes the date from the 11th to the 9th century, indicating that Joan reigned between Leo IV and Benedict III in the 850s. According to the &quot;Chronicon&quot;:

One version of the &quot;Chronicon&quot; gives an alternative fate for the female pope: she did not die immediately after her exposure but was confined and deposed, after which she did many years of penance. Her son from the affair eventually became Bishop of Ostia and ordered her entombment in his cathedral when she died.

Other references to the female pope are attributed to earlier writers, though none appears in manuscripts that predate the &quot;Chronica&quot;. The one most commonly cited is Anastasius Bibliothecarius (d. 886), a compiler of &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, who was a contemporary of the female Pope by the &quot;Chronicon&quot;&#x27;s dating. However the story is found in only one unreliable manuscript of Anastasius. This manuscript, in the Vatican Library, bears the relevant passage inserted as a footnote at the bottom of a page. It is out of sequence and in a different hand, one that dates from after the time of Martin of Opava. This &#x27;witness&#x27; to the female pope is likely to be based on Martin&#x27;s account and not a possible source for it. The same is true of Marianus Scotus&#x27;s &quot;Chronicle of the Popes&quot;, a text written in the 11th century. Some of its manuscripts contain a brief mention of a female pope named Johanna (the earliest source to attach to her the female form of the name), but all these manuscripts are later than Martin&#x27;s work. Earlier manuscripts do not contain the legend.
Some versions of the legend suggest that subsequent popes were subjected to an examination whereby, having sat on a so-called &quot;sedia stercoraria&quot; or &#x27;dung chair&#x27; containing a hole, a cardinal had to reach up and establish that the new pope had testicles before announcing &quot;Duos habet et bene pendentes&quot; (&quot;He has two and they dangle nicely&quot;), or &quot;habet&quot; (&quot;he has them&quot;) for short.

There were associated legends as well. In the 1290s, the Dominican Robert of Uzès recounted a vision in which he saw the seat &quot;where, it is said, the pope is proved to be a man&quot;. Pope Joan has been associated with marvelous happenings. Petrarch (1304–1374) wrote in his &quot;Chronica de le Vite de Pontefici et Imperadori Romani&quot; that after Pope Joan had been revealed as a woman:

However the attribution of this work to Petrarch may be incorrect.

==Later development==

From the mid-13th century onward the legend was widely disseminated and believed. Joan was used as an &quot;exemplum&quot; in Dominican preaching. Bartolomeo Platina, the scholar who was prefect of the Vatican Library, wrote his &quot;Vitæ Pontificum Platinæ historici liber de vita Christi ac omnium pontificum qui hactenus ducenti fuere et XX&quot; in 1479 at the behest of his patron, Pope Sixtus IV. The book contains the following account of the female Pope:
Pope John VIII: John, of English extraction, was born at Mentz (Mainz) and is said to have arrived at popedom by evil art; for disguising herself like a man, whereas she was a woman, she went when young with her paramour, a learned man, to Athens, and made such progress in learning under the professors there that, coming to Rome, she met with few that could equal, much less go beyond her, even in the knowledge of the scriptures; and by her learned and ingenious readings and disputations, she acquired so great respect and authority that upon the death of Pope Leo IV (as Martin says) by common consent she was chosen pope in his room. As she was going to the Lateran Church between the Colossean Theatre (so called from Nero&#x27;s Colossus) and St. Clement&#x27;s her travail came upon her, and she died upon the place, having sat two years, one month, and four days, and was buried there without any pomp. This story is vulgarly told, but by very uncertain and obscure authors, and therefore I have related it barely and in short, lest I should seem obstinate and pertinacious if I had admitted what is so generally talked. I had better mistake with the rest of the world, though it be certain, that what I have related may be thought not altogether incredible.
References to the female Pope abound in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance. Jans der Enikel (1270s) was the first to tell the story in German. Giovanni Boccaccio wrote about her in &quot;De Mulieribus Claris&quot; (1353). The &quot;Chronicon&quot; of Adam of Usk (1404) gives her a name, Agnes, and furthermore mentions a statue in Rome that is said to be of her. This statue had never been mentioned by any earlier writer anywhere; presumably it was an actual statue that came to be taken to be of the female pope. A late-14th-century edition of the &quot;Mirabilia Urbis Romae&quot;, a guidebook for pilgrims to Rome, tells readers that the female Pope&#x27;s remains are buried at St. Peter&#x27;s. It was around this time that a long series of busts of past Popes was made for the Duomo of Siena, which included one of the female pope, named as &quot;Johannes VIII, Foemina de Anglia&quot; and included between Leo IV and Benedict III.

At his trial in 1415 Jan Hus argued that the Church did not necessarily need a pope because, during the pontificate of &quot;Pope Agnes&quot; (as he also called her), it got on quite well. Hus&#x27;s opponents at the trial insisted that his argument proved no such thing about the independence of the Church but they did not dispute that there had been a female pope at all.

==During the Reformation==
In 1587 Florimond de Raemond, a magistrate in the parlement de Bordeaux and an antiquary, published his first attempt to deconstruct the legend, &quot;Erreur Populaire de la Papesse Jeanne&quot; (also subsequently published under the title &quot;L&#x27;Anti-Papesse&quot;). The tract applied humanist techniques of textual criticism to the Pope Joan legend, with the broader intent of supplying sound historical principles to ecclesiastical history, and the legend began to come apart, detail by detail. Raemond&#x27;s &quot;Erreur Populaire&quot; went through successive editions, reaching a fifteenth as late as 1691.

In 1601, Pope Clement VIII declared the legend of the female pope to be untrue. The famous bust of her, inscribed &quot;Johannes VIII, Femina ex Anglia,&quot; which had been carved for the series of papal figures in the Duomo di Siena about 1400 and was noted by travelers, was either destroyed or recarved and relabeled, replaced by a male figure, that of Pope Zachary.

The legend of Pope Joan was &quot;effectively demolished&quot; by David Blondel, a mid-17th-century Protestant historian, who suggested that Pope Joan&#x27;s tale may have originated in a satire against Pope John XI, who died in his early 20s. Blondel, through detailed analysis of the claims and suggested timings, argued that no such events could have happened.

The 16th-century Italian historian Onofrio Panvinio, commenting on one of Bartolomeo Platina&#x27;s works that refer to Pope Joan, theorized that the story of Pope Joan may have originated from tales of Pope John XII; John reportedly had many mistresses, including one called Joan, who was very influential in Rome during his pontificate.
At the time of the Reformation, various Protestant writers took up the Pope Joan legend in their anti-Catholic writings, and the Catholics responded with their own polemic. According to Pierre Gustave Brunet, Various authors, in the 16th and 17th centuries, occupied themselves with Pope Joan, but it was from the point of view of the polemic engaged in between the partisans of Lutheran or Calvinist reform and the apologists of Catholicism.
An English writer, Alexander Cooke, wrote a book entitled &quot;Pope Joane: A Dialogue between a Protestant and a Papist&quot;, which purported to prove the existence of Pope Joan by reference to Catholic traditions. It was republished in 1675 as &quot;A Present for a Papist: Or the Life and Death of Pope Joan, Plainly Proving Out of the Printed Copies, and Manscriptes of Popish Writers and Others, That a Woman called Joan, Was Really Pope of Rome, and Was There Deliver&#x27;d of a Bastard Son in the Open Street as She Went in Solemn Procession&quot;. The book gives an account of Pope Joan giving birth to a son in plain view of all those around, accompanied by a detailed engraving showing a rather surprised looking baby peeking out from under the Pope&#x27;s robes. Even in the 19th century, authors such as Ewaldus Kist and Karl Hase discussed the story as a real occurrence. However, other Protestant writers, such as David Blondel and Gottfried Leibniz, rejected the story.

==Recent analysis and critique==
Most scholars of the 20th and 21st centuries have dismissed Pope Joan as a medieval legend. British historian John Julius Norwich dismissed the myth with a logical assessment of evidence. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Popes&quot; declares that there is &quot;no contemporary evidence for a female Pope at any of the dates suggested for her reign&quot;, but nonetheless acknowledges that Pope Joan&#x27;s legend was widely believed for centuries.

The 1910 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; elaborated on the historical timeline problem:

Between Leo IV and Benedict III, where Martinus Polonus places her, she cannot be inserted, because Leo IV died 17 July 855, and immediately after his death Benedict III was elected by the clergy and people of Rome; but, owing to the setting up of an Antipope, in the person of the deposed Cardinal Anastasius, he was not consecrated until 29 September. Coins exist which bear both the image of Benedict III and of Emperor Lothair, who died 28 September 855; therefore Benedict must have been recognized as pope before the last-mentioned date. On 7 October 855, Benedict III issued a charter for the Abbey of Corvey. Hincmar, Archbishop of Reims, informed Nicholas I that a messenger whom he had sent to Leo IV learned on his way of the death of this Pope, and therefore handed his petition to Benedict III, who decided it (Hincmar, ep. xl in P.L., CXXXVI, 85). All these witnesses prove the correctness of the dates given in the lives of Leo IV and Benedict III, and there was no interregnum between these two Popes, so that at this place there is no room for the alleged Popess.

It has also been noted that enemies of the papacy in the 9th century make no mention of a female Pope. For example, Photios I of Constantinople, who became Patriarch of Constantinople in 858 and was deposed by Pope Nicholas I in 863, had a contentious relationship with the Pope. He strongly defended his own authority as patriarch and opposed the influence of the Pope in Rome and would have likely highlighted any scandals of that time regarding the papacy; but he never mentions the story once in any of his voluminous writings. Indeed, at one point he mentions &quot;Leo and Benedict, successively great priests of the Roman Church&quot;.

Rosemary and Darroll Pardoe, authors of &quot;The Female Pope: The Mystery of Pope Joan&quot;, theorize that if a female pope did exist, a more plausible time frame is 1086 and 1108, when there were several antipopes; during this time the reign of the legitimate popes Victor III, Urban II, and Paschal II was not always established in Rome, since the city was occupied by Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, and later sacked by the Normans. This also agrees with the earliest known version of the legend, by Jean de Mailly, as he places the story in the year 1099. De Mailly&#x27;s account was acknowledged by his companion Stephen of Bourbon.

Peter Stanford, a British writer and former editor of &quot;The Catholic Herald&quot;, concluded in &quot;The Legend of Pope Joan: In Search of the Truth&quot; (2000) &quot;Weighing all th[e] evidence, I am convinced that Pope Joan was an historical figure, though perhaps not all the details about her that have been passed on down the centuries are true&quot;. Stanford&#x27;s work has been criticised as &quot;credulous&quot; by one mainstream historian, Vincent DiMarco. Against the lack of historical evidence to her existence, the question remains as to why the Pope Joan story has been popular and widely believed. Philip Jenkins in &quot;The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice&quot; suggests that the periodic revival of what he calls this &quot;anti-papal legend&quot; has more to do with feminist and anti-Catholic wishful thinking than historical accuracy.
The &quot;sedes stercoraria&quot;, the throne with a hole in the seat, now at St. John Lateran (the formal residence of the popes and center of Catholicism), is to be considered. This and other toilet-like chairs were used in the consecration of Pope Pascal II in 1099. In fact, one is still in the Vatican Museums, another at the Musée du Louvre. The reason for the configuration of the chair is disputed. It has been speculated that they originally were Roman bidets or imperial birthing stools, which because of their age and imperial links were used in ceremonies by Popes intent on highlighting their own imperial claims (as they did also with their Latin title, &quot;Pontifex Maximus&quot;).

Alain Boureau quotes the humanist Jacopo d&#x27;Angelo de Scarparia, who visited Rome in 1406 for the enthronement of Gregory XII. The pope sat briefly on two &quot;pierced chairs&quot; at the Lateran: &quot;... the vulgar tell the insane fable that he is touched to verify that he is indeed a man&quot;, a sign that this corollary of the Pope Joan legend was still current in the Roman street.

Medieval popes, from the 13th century onward, did indeed avoid the direct route between the Lateran and St Peter&#x27;s, as Martin of Opava claimed. However, there is no evidence that this practice dated back any earlier. The origin of the practice is uncertain, but it is quite likely that it was maintained because of widespread belief in the Joan legend, and it was thought genuinely to date back to that period.

Although some medieval writers referred to the female pope as &quot;John VIII&quot;, a genuine Pope John VIII reigned between 872 and 882. Due to the scarcity of records in the Early Middle Ages, confusion often reigns in the evaluation of events. The Pope Joan legend is also conflated with the gap in the numbering of the Johns. In the 11th century, Pope John XIV was mistakenly counted as two popes. When Petrus Hispanus was elected pope in 1276, he believed that there had already been twenty popes named John, so he skipped the number XX and numbered himself John XXI.

In 2018, Michael E. Habicht, an archaeologist at Flinders University, published new evidence in support of an historical Pope Joan. Habicht and grapho-analyst Marguerite Spycher analyzed papal monograms on medieval coins and found that there were two significantly different monograms attributed to Pope John VIII. Habicht argues that the earlier monogram, which he dates from 856 to 858, belongs to Pope Joan, while the latter monogram, which he dates to after 875, belongs to Pope John VIII.

==In fiction==
Pope Joan has remained a popular subject for fictional works across artistic forms. 

Plays featuring or referencing her include Ludwig Achim von Arnim&#x27;s &quot;Päpstin Johanna&quot; (1813), a fragment by Bertolt Brecht (in &quot;Werke&quot; Bd 10), a monodrama, &quot;Pausin Johanna&quot;, by Cees van der Pluijm (1996), and Caryl Churchill&#x27;s 1982 play, &quot;Top Girls&quot;, which featured Pope Joan as a character. In July 2019 a theatrical show, &quot;Pope Joan&quot;, was held in Malta at Mdina ditch featuring her as the main character.

She has also appeared widely in novels. 

The Greek author Emmanuel Rhoides&#x27; 1866 novel, &quot;The Papess Joanne&quot;, was admired by Mark Twain and Alfred Jarry and freely translated by Lawrence Durrell as &quot;The Curious History of Pope Joan&quot; (1954). The legend also inspired Jarry&#x27;s final written work before his death, &quot;The Pope&#x27;s Mustard-Maker&quot; (1907), an operetta about a female pope known as Jane of Eggs, who operates under the papal name John VIII.

The American Donna Woolfolk Cross&#x27;s 1996 historical romance, &quot;Pope Joan&quot; (later produced as a German musical and 2009 film). Other novels include Wilhelm Smets&#x27; &quot;Das Mährchen von der Päpstin Johanna auf’s Neue erörtert&quot; (1829), Marjorie Bowen&#x27;s &quot;Black Magic&quot; (1909), Ludwig Gorm&#x27;s &quot;Päpstin Johanna&quot; (1912), Yves Bichet&#x27;s &quot;La Papesse Jeanne&quot; (2005) and Hugo N. Gerstl&#x27;s &quot;Scribe: The Story of the Only Female Pope&quot; (2005). Howard Pyle&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; contains a reference. In the 2016 novel by Robert Harris, &quot;Conclave&quot; (later filmed), a liberal candidate to the Papacy states that his reginal name would be &quot;John&quot;, foreshadowing a twist with parallels to the legend of Pope Joan. Emily Maguire’s 2024 historical fiction novel, &quot;Rapture&quot;, is a retelling of the legend of Pope Joan.

There have been two films based on the story of Pope Joan. In 1972, Michael Anderson directed &quot;Pope Joan&quot; (1972; released as &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Imposter&quot; in the US; re-released in 2009 as &quot;She ... Who Would Be Pope&quot;). And in 2009, Cross&#x27;s novel was filmed as &quot;Pope Joan&quot;.

Finally, Pope Joan has even featured in video games. She appears as a Ruler class Servant in the 2015 mobile game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, and is the inspiration for Johanna, one of Makoto Niijima&#x27;s titular personas (manifestations of the soul used by humans to battle demons), in the 2016 video game &quot;Persona 5&quot;.

<text>Pierre Allix (1641 – 3 March 1717) was a French Protestant pastor and author. In 1690 Allix was created Doctor of Divinity by Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and was given the treasurership and a canonry in Salisbury Cathedral by Bishop Gilbert Burnet. He discovered that Codex Ephraemi is a palimpsest.

==Life==
Born in 1641 in Alençon, France, he became a pastor first at Saint-Agobile Champagne, and then at Charenton, near Paris. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 compelled him to take refuge in London. There he set up a church in Jewin Street, Aldersgate. He was the most celebrated Huguenot preacher of the 1680s in England, closely associated with Charles Le Cène, and known to advocate religious toleration.

In 1690 Allix was created Doctor of Divinity by Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and was given the treasurership and a canonry in Salisbury Cathedral by Bishop Gilbert Burnet.

Allix discovered that Codex Ephraemi is a palimpsest. He died in London. He had a large personal library which was sold by retail sale upon his death. 

==Works==
The numerous works of Allix were in French, Latin, and English. They are chiefly of apologetic character. Against Jacques-Benigne Bossuet he published &quot;Some Remarks upon the Ecclesiastical History of the Ancient Churches of Piedmont&quot; (1690), and &quot;Remarks upon the Ecclesiastical History of the Ancient Churches of the Albigenses&quot; (1692), with the idea of showing that the Albigensians were not Manichaeans, but historically identical with the Waldenses. They were as follows:

* &quot;Reponse à la Dissertation par Bertram, et Jean Scott, ou Erigene&quot;, 1670. 
* &quot;Ratramme, ou Bertram Prêtre; du corps et du sang du Seigneur&quot;, 1672.

* &quot;Douze Sermons de P. A. sur divers textes&quot;, 1685. 
* &quot;Determinatio F. Joannis Parisiensis de modo existendi corporis Christi in sacramento altaris&quot;, 1686 (arguing that the Church of Rome did not hold transubstantiation before the Council of Trent). 
* &quot;Les maximes du vrai Chrétien&quot;, 1687. 
* &quot;L&#x27;Adieu de St. Paul aux Ephesiens&quot;, 1688. This sermon was intended to be preached at Charenton on the day on which the church was closed. 
* &quot;A Discourse concerning Penance&quot;, 1688. 
* &quot;A Discourse concerning the Merit of Good Works&quot;, 1688. 
* &quot;An Historical Discourse concerning the Necessity of the Minister&#x27;s Intention in administering the Sacrament&quot;, 1688.

<text>Prospero Alpini (also known as Prosper Alpinus, Prospero Alpinio and Latinized as Prosperus Alpinus) (23 November 15536 February 1617) was a Venetian physician and botanist. He travelled around Egypt and served as the fourth prefect in charge of the botanical garden of Padua. He wrote several botanical treatises which covered exotic plants of economic and medicinal value. His description of coffee and banana plants are considered the oldest in European literature. The ginger-family genus &quot;Alpinia&quot; was named in his honour by Carolus Linnaeus.

== Biography ==

Born at Marostica, a town near Vicenza, the son of Francesco, a physician, Alpini served in his youth for a time in the Milanese army, but in 1574 he went to study medicine at Padua. After taking his doctor&#x27;s degree in 1578, he settled as a physician in Campo San Pietro, a small town in the Paduan territory. But his tastes were botanical and influenced by Melchiorre Guilandino, and to extend his knowledge of exotic plants he travelled to Egypt in 1580 as physician to Giorgio Emo, the Venetian consul in Cairo. The position was obtained with help from Antonio Morosini. From 1587 to 1590 he worked in Venice, Bassano and then at Genoa as physician to Giovanni Andrea Doria.

In Egypt he spent three years, and from a practice in the management of datepalms, which he observed in that country, he learned of sexual difference in plants, which was later to become important in the foundation of the Linnaean taxonomy system. He says that &quot;the female date-trees or palms do not bear fruit unless the branches of the male and female plants are mixed together; or, as is generally done, unless the dust found in the male sheath or male flowers is sprinkled over the female flowers&quot;.

On his return, he resided for some time at Genoa as physician to Andrea Doria, and in 1593 he was appointed professor of botany at Padua. In 1603, following the death of Giacomo Antonio Cortuso (1513-1603), he was appointed prefect for the botanical garden at Padua. His knowledge of medicinal plants made him a much sought after physician consulted by others such as Fabrici of Acquapendente and Alessandro Massaria. Towards the end of his life he suffered from arthritis, skin inflammation and receptive aphasia. He died on 6 February 1617 and is buried in the Basilica of Saint Antonio. He was succeeded in the botanical chair by his son Alpino Alpini (died 1637).

== Books ==
Alpini&#x27;s best-known botanical work is &quot;De Plantis Aegypti liber&quot; (Venice, 1592). This work introduced a number of plant species previously unknown to European botanists including &quot;Abrus, Abelmoschus, Lablab,&quot; and &quot;Melochia,&quot; each of which are native to tropical areas and were cultivated with artificial irrigation in Egypt at the time. Other species included &quot;Sesban&quot; &quot;Sesbania sesban&quot; and the baobab tree (which he spelled &quot;bahobab&quot;). Early adopters of Alpini&#x27;s new botanical names included the botanists Carolus Clusius (died 1609), Johann Bauhin (died 1613), Caspar Bauhin (died 1624) and Johann Veslingius (visited Egypt in the 1620s; died 1649).

Prospero Alpini&#x27;s &#x27; was published in 1629 after his death. It has an expansion of the material in &#x27; plus some other material. His &quot;De Plantis Aegypti liber&quot; is said to contain the first account of the coffee plant published in Europe although the German traveller Leonhard Rauwolf tasted coffee at Aleppo in 1573 and described its effects in 1582. His book &quot;De balsamo dialogus&quot; (1581, 1592) was among the first books to specialize on a single group of plants. He wrote on the prognosis of diseases in his &quot;De praesagienda vita et morti aegrotanti&quot; (1601) which led Kurt Sprengel to consider him as a modern father of diagnostic science. Another work that took nearly a decade was the &quot;De medicina methodica libri tredecim&quot; (1611) which sought a revival of the Methodic school of medicine. His works &quot;De plantis exoticis&quot; and the &quot;Rerum Aegyptiarum libri IV&quot; were published posthumously.

The genus &quot;Alpinia&quot;, belonging to the order Zingiberaceae (ginger family), was named after him by Linnaeus.

<doc id="23821" wikidata="Q162401" url="?curid=23821" title="Prague Spring">
<text>The Prague Spring (, ) was a period of political liberalization and mass protest in 
the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. It began on 5 January 1968, when reformist Alexander Dubček was elected First Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ), and continued until 21 August 1968, when the Soviet Union and three other Warsaw Pact members (Bulgaria, Hungary and Poland) invaded the country to suppress the reforms.

The Prague Spring reforms were a strong attempt by Dubček to grant additional rights to the citizens of Czechoslovakia in an act of partial decentralization of the economy and democratization. The freedoms granted included a loosening of restrictions on the media, speech and travel. After national discussion of dividing the country into a federation of three republics, Bohemia, Moravia–Silesia and Slovakia, Dubček oversaw the decision to split into two, the Czech Socialist Republic and Slovak Socialist Republic. This dual federation was the only formal change that survived the invasion.

The reforms, especially the decentralization of administrative authority, were not received well by the Soviets, who, after failed negotiations, sent half a million Warsaw Pact troops and tanks to occupy the country. &quot;The New York Times&quot; cited reports of 650,000 men equipped with the most modern and sophisticated weapons in the Soviet military catalogue. A massive wave of emigration swept the nation. Resistance was mounted throughout the country, involving attempted fraternization, sabotage of street signs, defiance of curfews, etc. While the Soviet military had predicted that it would take four days to subdue the country, the resistance held out for almost eight months until diplomatic maneuvers finally circumvented it. It became a high-profile example of civilian-based defense; there were sporadic acts of violence and several protest suicides by self-immolation (the most famous being that of Jan Palach), but no military resistance. Czechoslovakia remained a Soviet satellite state until 1989 when the Velvet Revolution peacefully ended the communist regime; the last Soviet troops left the country in 1991.

After the invasion, Czechoslovakia entered a period known as &quot;normalization&quot; (, ), in which new leaders attempted to restore the political and economic values that had prevailed before Dubček gained control of the KSČ. Gustáv Husák, who replaced Dubček as First Secretary and also became President, reversed almost all of the reforms. The Prague Spring inspired music and literature including the work of Václav Havel, Karel Husa, Karel Kryl and Milan Kundera&#x27;s novel &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;.

==Background==
The process of de-Stalinization in Czechoslovakia had begun under Antonín Novotný in the late 1950s and early 1960s, but had progressed more slowly than in most other states of the Eastern Bloc. Following the lead of Nikita Khrushchev, Novotný proclaimed the &quot;completion of socialism&quot;, and the new constitution accordingly adopted the name change from &quot;Czechoslovak Republic&quot; to &quot;Czechoslovak Socialist Republic&quot;. The pace of de-Stalinization, however, was sluggish; the rehabilitation of Stalin-era victims, such as those convicted in the Slánský trial, may have been considered as early as 1963, but did not take place until 1967.

In the early 1960s, Czechoslovakia underwent an economic downturn. The Soviet model of industrialization applied poorly to Czechoslovakia since the country was already quite industrialized before World War II while the Soviet model mainly took into account less developed economies. Novotný&#x27;s attempt at restructuring the economy, the 1965 &quot;New Economic Model&quot;, spurred increased demand for political reform as well.

The liberalization of 1960s enabled a partial reclaiming of the political and cultural legacy of the First Czechoslovak Republic and its figures such as Tomáš Masaryk, which was ideologically suppressed in the Stalin era as bourgeois nationalist and liberal capitalist. This reclamation can be seen in the success of publications such as &quot;Tomáš G. Masaryk&quot; (1968) by Milan Machovec.

=== 1963 Liblice Conference ===
In May 1963, some Marxist intellectuals organized the &quot;Liblice Conference&quot; that discussed Franz Kafka&#x27;s life, marking the beginning of the cultural democratization of Czechoslovakia which ultimately led to the 1968 &quot;Prague Spring&quot;, an era of political liberalization. This conference was unique because it symbolized Kafka&#x27;s rehabilitation in the Eastern Bloc after having been heavily criticized, led to a partial opening up of the regime and influenced the relaxation of censorship. It also had an international impact as a representative from all Eastern Bloc countries were invited to the Conference; only the Soviet Union did not send any representative. This conference had a revolutionary effect and paved the way for the reforms while making Kafka the symbol of the renaissance of Czechoslovak artistic and intellectual freedom.

===1967 Writers&#x27; Congress===
As the strict regime eased its rules, the &quot;Union of Czechoslovak Writers&quot; () cautiously began to air discontent. In &quot;Literární noviny&quot;, the union&#x27;s previously hard-line communist weekly, members suggested that literature should be independent of the Communist Party doctrine.

In June 1967, a small fraction of the union sympathized with radical socialists, especially Ludvík Vaculík, Milan Kundera, Jan Procházka, Antonín Jaroslav Liehm, Pavel Kohout and Ivan Klíma.

A few months later, at a meeting of Party leaders, it was decided that administrative actions against the writers who openly expressed support of reformation would be taken. Since only a small group of the union held these beliefs, the remaining members were relied upon to discipline their colleagues. Control over &quot;Literární noviny&quot; and several other publishers was transferred to the Ministry of Culture, and even some leaders of the Party who later became major reformers—including Dubček—endorsed these moves.

==Dubček&#x27;s rise to power==
As President Antonín Novotný was losing support, Alexander Dubček, the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Slovakia, and economist Ota Šik challenged him at a meeting of the Central Committee of the Party. Novotný then invited the Secretary General of the Communist Party of Soviet Union, Leonid Brezhnev, to Prague that December, seeking support; Brezhnev, however, was surprised at the extent of the opposition to Novotný and so he rather supported his removal. Dubček replaced Novotný as First Secretary on 5 January 1968. On 22 March, Novotný resigned and was replaced by Ludvík Svoboda, who later gave consent to the reforms.

===Literární listy===
Early signs of change were few. In an interview with KSČ Presidium member Josef Smrkovský published in the Party newspaper &quot;Rudé Právo&quot; with the title &quot;What Lies Ahead&quot;, he insisted that Dubček&#x27;s appointment at the January Plenum would further the goals of socialism and maintain the &quot;working class&quot; nature of the Party.

However, right after Dubček assumed power, the scholar Eduard Goldstücker became chairman of the &quot;Union of Czechoslovak Writers&quot; and thus editor-in-chief of &quot;Literární noviny&quot;, which under Novotný had been filled with party loyalists. Goldstücker tested the boundaries of Dubček&#x27;s devotion to freedom of the press when on 4 February he appeared in a television interview as the new head of the union. During the interview he openly criticized Novotný, exposing all of Novotný&#x27;s previously unreported policies and explaining how they were preventing progress in Czechoslovakia.

Goldstücker suffered no repercussions, Dubček instead began to build a sense of trust among the media, the government, and the citizens. It was under Goldstücker that the journal&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Literární listy&quot;, and on 29 February, the Union published the first copy of the censor-free journal. By August, &quot;Literární listy&quot; had a circulation of 300,000, making it the most published periodical in Europe.

==Socialism with a human face==
=== Action Programme ===
At the 20th anniversary of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s &quot;Victorious February&quot;, Dubček delivered a speech explaining the need for change following the triumph of socialism. He emphasized the need to &quot;enforce the leading role of the party more effectively&quot; In April, Dubček launched an &quot;Action Programme&quot; of liberalizations, which included increasing freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of movement, with economic emphasis on consumer goods and the possibility of a multiparty government. The programme was based on the view that &quot;Socialism cannot mean only liberation of the working people from the domination of exploiting class relations, but must make more provisions for a fuller life of the personality than any bourgeois democracy.&quot; It would limit the power of the secret police and provide for the federalization of the ČSSR into two equal nations. The programme also covered foreign policy, including both the maintenance of good relations with Western countries and cooperation with the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc nations. It spoke of a ten-year transition through which democratic elections would be made possible and a new form of democratic socialism would replace the status quo. Those who drafted the Action Programme were careful not to criticize the actions of the post-war Communist regime, only to point out policies that they felt had outlived their usefulness. Although it was stipulated that reform must proceed under KSČ direction, popular pressure mounted to implement reforms immediately. Radical elements became more vocal: anti-Soviet polemics appeared in the press on 26 June 1968, and new unaffiliated political clubs were created. Party conservatives urged repressive measures, but Dubček counselled moderation and re-emphasized KSČ leadership. At the Presidium of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia in April, Dubček announced a political programme of &quot;socialism with a human face&quot;. At the time of the Prague Spring, Czechoslovak exports were declining in competitiveness, and Dubček&#x27;s reforms planned to solve these troubles by mixing planned and market economies. Dubček continued to stress the importance of economic reform proceeding under Communist Party rule.

===Media reactions===

Freedom of the press opened the door for the first look at Czechoslovakia&#x27;s past by Czechoslovakia&#x27;s people. Many of the investigations centered on the country&#x27;s history under communism, especially in the instance of the Stalinist-period. In another television appearance, Goldstücker presented both doctored and undoctored photographs of former communist leaders who had been purged, imprisoned, or executed and thus erased from communist history. The Writers&#x27; Union also formed a committee in April 1968, headed by the poet Jaroslav Seifert, to investigate the persecution of writers after the Communist takeover in February 1948 and rehabilitate the literary figures into the Union, bookstores and libraries, and the literary world. Discussions on the current state of communism and abstract ideas such as freedom and identity were also becoming more common; soon, non-party publications began appearing, such as the trade union daily &quot;Práce&quot; (Labour). This was also helped by the Journalists&#x27; Union, which by March 1968 had already persuaded the Central Publication Board, the government censor, to allow editors to receive uncensored subscriptions to foreign papers, allowing for a more international dialogue around the news.

The press, the radio, and the television also contributed to these discussions by hosting meetings where students and young workers could ask questions of writers such as Goldstücker, Pavel Kohout, and Jan Procházka and political victims such as Josef Smrkovský, Zdeněk Hejzlar, and Gustáv Husák. Television also broadcast meetings between former political prisoners and the communist leaders from the secret police or prisons where they were held. Most importantly, this new self-called freedom and the introduction of television into the lives of everyday Czechoslovak citizens moved the political dialogue from the intellectual to the popular sphere.

=== Soviet reaction ===
Initial reaction within the Communist Bloc was mixed. Hungary&#x27;s János Kádár was highly supportive of Dubček&#x27;s appointment in January, but Leonid Brezhnev and the hardliners grew concerned about the reforms, which they feared might weaken the position of the Bloc in the Cold War.

At a meeting in Dresden, East Germany on 23 March, the leaders of the &quot;Warsaw Five&quot; (USSR, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria and East Germany) questioned the Czechoslovak delegation over the planned reforms, suggesting any talk of &quot;democratization&quot; was a veiled criticism of the Soviet model. The Polish Party leader Władysław Gomułka and János Kádár were less concerned with the reforms themselves than with the growing criticisms levelled by the Czechoslovak media, and worried that the situation might be &quot;similar to...the &#x27;Hungarian counterrevolution&#x27;.&quot; Some of the language in the Action Programme may have been chosen to assert that no &quot;counterrevolution&quot; was planned, but Kieran Williams suggests that Dubček was perhaps surprised at, but not resentful of, Soviet suggestions.

In May, the KGB initiated Operation Progress, which involved Soviet agents infiltrating Czechoslovak pro-democratic organizations, such as the Socialist and Christian Democrat parties.

The Soviet leadership tried to stop, or at least limit, the changes in the ČSSR through a series of negotiations. The Soviet Union agreed to bilateral talks with Czechoslovakia from 29 July to 1 August at Čierna nad Tisou, near the Soviet border. The Soviets were represented by almost the full Politburo that met for the first time outside the territory of the Soviet Union; also the Czechoslovak delegation included the full membership of the Presidium, but the main agreements were reached at the meetings of the &quot;fours&quot; – Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin, Nikolai Podgorny, Mikhail Suslov – Dubček, Ludvík Svoboda, Oldřich Černík, Josef Smrkovský.

At the meeting Dubček defended the proposals of the KSČ&#x27;s reformist wing while pledging commitment to the Warsaw Pact and Comecon. The KSČ leadership, however, was divided between vigorous reformers (Smrkovský, Černík, and František Kriegel) and hardliners (Vasil Biľak, Drahomír Kolder, and Oldřich Švestka) who adopted an anti-reformist stance.

Brezhnev decided on compromise. The KSČ delegates reaffirmed their loyalty to the Warsaw Pact and promised to curb &quot;anti-socialist&quot; tendencies, prevent the revival of the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Party and control the press more effectively. The Soviets agreed to withdraw their armed forces still in Czechoslovakia after manoeuvres in June and permit the 9 September &quot;Party Congress&quot;.

On 3 August representatives from the &quot;Warsaw Five&quot; and Czechoslovakia met in Bratislava and signed the Bratislava Declaration. The declaration affirmed unshakable fidelity to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, declared an implacable struggle against &quot;bourgeois&quot; ideology and all &quot;anti-socialist&quot; forces. The Soviet Union expressed its intention to intervene in any Warsaw Pact country if a &quot;bourgeois&quot; system—a pluralist system of several political parties representing different factions of the &quot;capitalist classes&quot;—was ever established. After the conference, the Soviet troops left Czechoslovak territory but remained along its borders.

== Soviet invasion ==

As these talks proved unsatisfactory, the Soviets began to consider a military alternative. The Soviet policy of compelling the socialist governments of its satellite states to subordinate their national interests to those of the Eastern Bloc (through military force if needed) became known as the Brezhnev Doctrine. On the night of 20–21 August, Eastern Bloc armies from four Warsaw Pact countries—the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Poland and Hungary—invaded the ČSSR.

That night, 165,000 troops and 4,600 tanks entered the country. They first occupied the Ruzyně International Airport, where air deployment of more troops was arranged. The Czechoslovak forces were confined to their barracks, which were surrounded until the threat of a counter-attack was assuaged. By the morning of 21 August Czechoslovakia was occupied.

Romania and Albania refused to take part in the invasion. Soviet command refrained from drawing upon East German troops for fear of reviving memories of the Nazi invasion in 1938. During the invasion 72 Czechs and Slovaks were killed (19 of those in Slovakia), 266 severely wounded and another 436 slightly injured. Alexander Dubček called upon his people not to resist. Nevertheless, there was scattered resistance in the streets. Road signs in towns were removed or painted over—except for those indicating the way to Moscow. Many small villages renamed themselves &quot;Dubček&quot; or &quot;Svoboda&quot;; thus, without navigational equipment, the invaders were often confused.

On the night of the invasion the &quot;Czechoslovak Presidium&quot; declared that Warsaw Pact troops had crossed the border without the knowledge of the ČSSR government, but the Soviet Press printed an unsigned request—allegedly by Czechoslovak party and state leaders—for &quot;immediate assistance, including assistance with armed forces&quot;. At the &quot;14th KSČ Party Congress&quot; (conducted secretly, immediately following the intervention), it was emphasized that no member of the leadership had invited the intervention. More recent evidence suggests that conservative KSČ members (including Biľak, Švestka, Kolder, Indra, and Kapek) did send a request for intervention to the Soviets. The invasion was followed by a previously unseen wave of emigration, which was stopped shortly thereafter. An estimated 70,000 citizens fled the country immediately with an eventual total of some 300,000.

Until recently there was some uncertainty as to what provocation, if any, occurred to make the Warsaw Pact armies invade. Preceding the invasion was a rather calm period without any major events taking place in Czechoslovakia.

=== Reactions to the invasion ===

In Czechoslovakia, especially in the week following the invasion, popular opposition was expressed in numerous spontaneous acts of nonviolent resistance. Civilians purposely gave wrong directions to invading soldiers, while others identified and followed cars belonging to the secret police. On 16 January 1969, student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Prague&#x27;s Wenceslas Square to protest against the renewed suppression of free speech.

The generalized resistance caused the Soviet Union to abandon its original plan to oust the First Secretary. Dubček, who had been arrested on the night of 20 August, was taken to Moscow for negotiations. There, under heavy psychological pressure from Soviet politicians, Dubček and all the highest-ranked leaders but František Kriegel signed the Moscow Protocol. It was agreed that Dubček would remain in office and a programme of moderate reform would continue.

On 25 August citizens of the Soviet Union who did not approve of the invasion protested in Red Square; seven protesters opened banners with anti-invasion slogans. The demonstrators were brutally beaten and arrested by security forces, and later punished by a secret tribunal; the protest was dubbed &quot;anti-Soviet&quot; and several people were detained in psychiatric hospitals.

A more pronounced effect took place in Romania, where Nicolae Ceaușescu, General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party, already a staunch opponent of Soviet influences and a self-declared Dubček supporter, gave a public speech in Bucharest on the day of the invasion, depicting Soviet policies in harsh terms. Albania withdrew from the Warsaw Pact in opposition, calling the invasion an act of &quot;social imperialism&quot;. In Finland, a country under some Soviet political influence, the occupation caused a major scandal.

Like the Italian and French Communist parties, the majority of the Communist Party of Finland denounced the occupation. Nonetheless, Finnish president Urho Kekkonen was the first Western politician to officially visit Czechoslovakia after August 1968; he received the highest Czechoslovak honours from the hands of President Ludvík Svoboda, on 4 October 1969. A schism occurred between the East German communist Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the Icelandic Socialist Party because of the latter&#x27;s disapproval of the invasion and occupation of Czechoslovakia, causing relations between Iceland and East Germany to deteriorate. The Portuguese communist secretary-general Álvaro Cunhal was one of few political leaders from western Europe to have supported the invasion for being counter-revolutionary, along with the Luxembourg party and conservative factions of the Greek party.

Most countries offered only vocal criticism following the invasion. The night of the invasion, Canada, Denmark, France, Paraguay, the United Kingdom, and the United States requested a meeting of the United Nations Security Council. At the meeting, the Czechoslovak ambassador Jan Mužík denounced the invasion. Soviet ambassador Jacob Malik insisted the Warsaw Pact actions were &quot;fraternal assistance&quot; against &quot;antisocial forces&quot;.

The British government strongly condemned the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, although it cautiously avoided making any diplomatic moves that may have provoked a Soviet counter-response and a jeopardisation of détente. The United Kingdom&#x27;s foreign policy toward the Soviet Union was minimally impacted in the long-term, and quickly reverted to the status quo that existed prior to the Prague Spring following the brief period of intense criticism.

One of the nations that most vehemently condemned the invasion was China, which objected furiously to the so-called &quot;Brezhnev Doctrine&quot; that declared the Soviet Union alone had the right to determine what nations were properly Communist and could invade those Communist nations whose communism did not meet the Kremlin&#x27;s approval. Mao Zedong saw the Brezhnev Doctrine as the ideological basis for a Soviet invasion of China, and launched a massive propaganda campaign condemning the invasion of Czechoslovakia, despite his own earlier opposition to the Prague Spring. Speaking at a banquet at the Romanian embassy in Beijing on 23 August 1968, the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai denounced the Soviet Union for &quot;fascist politics, great power chauvinism, national egoism and social imperialism&quot;, going on to compare the invasion of Czechoslovakia to the American war in Vietnam and more pointedly to the policies of Adolf Hitler towards Czechoslovakia in 1938–39. Zhou ended his speech with a barely veiled call for the people of Czechoslovakia to wage guerrilla war against the Red Army.

The next day, several countries suggested a United Nations resolution condemning the intervention and calling for immediate withdrawal. Eventually, a UN vote was taken with ten members supporting the motion; Algeria, India, and Pakistan abstained; the USSR (with veto power) and Hungary opposed. Canadian delegates immediately introduced another motion asking for a UN representative to travel to Prague and work toward the release of the imprisoned Czechoslovak leaders.

By 26 August, a new Czechoslovak representative requested the whole issue be removed from the Security Council&#x27;s agenda. Shirley Temple Black visited Prague in August 1968 to prepare for becoming the US Ambassador for reformed Czechoslovakia. However, after the 21 August invasion, she became part of a U.S. Embassy-organized convoy of vehicles that evacuated U.S. citizens from the country. In August 1989, she returned to Prague as U.S. Ambassador, three months before the Velvet Revolution that ended 41 years of Communist rule.

The United States, West Germany and NATO maintained a low-key response to the invasion. After 1968 the U.S. recognized Soviet dominance in Eastern Europe, a development that was in the interests of the United States according to some analysts.

==Aftermath==

In April 1969, Dubček was replaced as first secretary by Gustáv Husák, and a period of &quot;normalization&quot; began. Dubček was expelled from the KSČ and given a job as a forestry official.

Husák reversed Dubček&#x27;s reforms, purged the party of its liberal members, and dismissed from public office professional and intellectual elites who openly expressed disagreement with the political transformation. (Many of those purged would later become the dissidents of Czechoslovak underground culture, active in Charter 77 and related movements which eventually met success in the Velvet Revolution.) Husák worked to reinstate the power of the police and strengthen ties with the rest of the Communist bloc. He also sought to re-centralize the economy, as a considerable amount of freedom had been granted to industries during the Prague Spring. Commentary on politics was forbidden in mainstream media, and political statements by anyone not considered to have &quot;full political trust&quot; were also banned. The only significant change that survived was the federalization of the country, which created the Czech Socialist Republic and the Slovak Socialist Republic in 1969.

In 1987, the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev acknowledged that his liberalizing policies of glasnost and perestroika owed a great deal to Dubček&#x27;s &quot;socialism with a human face&quot;. When asked what the difference was between the Prague Spring and Gorbachev&#x27;s own reforms, a Foreign Ministry spokesman replied, &quot;Nineteen years.&quot;

Dubček lent his support to the Velvet Revolution of December 1989. After the collapse of the Communist regime that month, Dubček became chairman of the federal assembly under the Havel administration. He later led the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia, and spoke against the dissolution of Czechoslovakia before his death in November 1992.

=== Normalization and censorship ===
The Warsaw Pact invasion included attacks on media establishments, such as Radio Prague and Czechoslovak Television, almost immediately after the initial tanks rolled into Prague on 21 August 1968. While both the radio station and the television station managed to hold out for at least enough time for initial broadcasts of the invasion, what the Soviets did not attack by force they attacked by reenacting party censorship. In reaction to the invasion, on 28 August 1968, all Czechoslovak publishers agreed to halt production of newspapers for the day to allow for a &quot;day of reflection&quot; for the editorial staffs. Writers and reporters agreed with Dubček to support a limited reinstitution of the censorship office, as long as the institution was to only last three months. Finally, by September 1968, the Czechoslovak Communist Party plenum was held to instate the new censorship law. In the words of the Moscow-approved resolution, &quot;The press, radio, and television are first of all the instruments for carrying into life the policies of the Party and state.&quot;

While that was not yet the end of the media&#x27;s self-called freedom after the Prague Spring, it was the beginning of the end. During November, the Presidium, under Husak, declared that the Czechoslovak press could not make any negative remarks about the Soviet invaders or they would risk violating the agreement they had come to at the end of August. When the weeklies &quot;Reporter&quot; and &quot;Politika&quot; responded harshly to this threat, even going so far as to not so subtly criticize the Presidium itself in &quot;Politika&quot;, the government banned &quot;Reporter&quot; for a month, suspended &quot;Politika&quot; indefinitely, and prohibited any political programs from appearing on the radio or television.

The intellectuals were stuck at an impasse; they recognized the government&#x27;s increasing normalization, but they were unsure whether to trust that the measures were only temporary or demand more. For example, still believing in Dubcek&#x27;s promises for reform, Milan Kundera published the article &quot;Cesky udel&quot; (Our Czech Destiny) in &quot;Literarni listy&quot; on 19 December. He wrote: &quot;People who today are falling into depression and defeatism, commenting that there are not enough guarantees, that everything could end badly, that we might again end up in a marasmus of censorship and trials, that this or that could happen, are simply weak people, who can live only in illusions of certainty.&quot;

In March 1969, however, the new Soviet-backed Czechoslovak government instituted full censorship, effectively ending the hopes that normalization would lead back to the freedoms enjoyed during the Prague Spring. A declaration was presented to the Presidium condemning the media as co-conspirators against the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact in their support of Dubcek&#x27;s liberalization measures. Finally, on 2 April 1969, the government adopted measures &quot;to secure peace and order&quot; through even stricter censorship, forcing the people of Czechoslovakia to wait until the thawing of Eastern Europe for the return of a free media.

Former students from Prague, including Constantine Menges, and Czech refugees from the crisis, who were able to escape or resettle in Western Countries continued to advocate for human rights, religious liberty, freedom of speech and political asylum for Czech political prisoners and dissidents. Many raised concerns about the Soviet Union and Soviet Army&#x27;s continued military occupation of Czechoslovakia in the 1970s and 1980s, before the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Communism in Moscow and Eastern Europe.

=== Cultural impact ===
The Prague Spring deepened the disillusionment of many Western leftists with Soviet views. It contributed to the growth of Eurocommunist ideas in Western communist parties, which sought greater distance from the Soviet Union and eventually led to the dissolution of many of these groups.
A decade later, a period of Chinese political liberalization became known as the Beijing Spring. It also partly influenced the Croatian Spring in Communist Yugoslavia. In a 1993 Czech survey, 60% of those surveyed had a personal memory linked to the Prague Spring while another 30% were familiar with the events in another form. The demonstrations and regime changes taking place in North Africa and the Middle East from December 2010 have frequently been referred to as an &quot;Arab Spring&quot;.

The event has been referenced in popular music, including the music of Karel Kryl, Luboš Fišer&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot;, and Karel Husa&#x27;s &quot;Music for Prague 1968&quot;.
The Israeli song &quot;Prague&quot;, written by Shalom Hanoch and performed by Arik Einstein at the Israel Song Festival of 1969, was a lamentation on the fate of the city after the Soviet invasion and mentions Jan Palach&#x27;s Self-immolation.
&quot;They Can&#x27;t Stop The Spring&quot;, a song by Irish journalist and songwriter John Waters, represented Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2007. Waters has described it as &quot;a kind of Celtic celebration of the Eastern European revolutions and their eventual outcome&quot;, quoting Dubček&#x27;s alleged comment: &quot;They may crush the flowers, but they can&#x27;t stop the Spring.&quot;
&quot;The Old Man&#x27;s Back Again (Dedicated to the Neo-Stalinist Regime)&quot;, a song featured in the American-English singer-songwriter Scott Walker&#x27;s fifth solo album Scott 4 also refers to the invasion.

The Prague Spring is featured in several works of literature. Milan Kundera set his novel &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot; during the Prague Spring. It follows the repercussions of increased Soviet presence and the dictatorial police control of the population. A film version was released in 1988. &quot;The Liberators&quot;, by Viktor Suvorov, is an eyewitness description of the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, from the point of view of a Soviet tank commander. &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, a play by award-winning Czech-born English playwright Tom Stoppard, references the Prague Spring, as well as the 1989 Velvet Revolution. Heda Margolius Kovály also ends her memoir &quot;Under a Cruel Star&quot; with a first hand account of the Prague Spring and the subsequent invasion, and her reflections upon these events.

In film there has been an adaptation of &quot;The Unbearable Lightness of Being&quot;, and also the movie &quot;Pelíšky&quot; from director Jan Hřebejk and screenwriter Petr Jarchovský, which depicts the events of the Prague Spring and ends with the invasion by the Soviet Union and their allies. The Czech musical film, &quot;Rebelové&quot; from Filip Renč, also depicts the events, the invasion and subsequent wave of emigration.

The number &quot;68&quot; has become iconic in the former Czechoslovakia. Ice hockey player Jaromír Jágr, whose grandfather died in prison during the rebellion, wears the number because of the importance of the year in Czechoslovak history. A former publishing house based in Toronto, 68 Publishers, that published books by exiled Czech and Slovak authors, took its name from the event.

== Memory ==

=== Places and historical sites ===
The photographs that were taken in Vinohradská Avenue and Wenceslas Square are widely represented in the photographic archive of the 1968 invasion while other sites of protests are missing. The memory of the Prague Spring is marked by the Czech Republic&#x27;s and Slovakia&#x27;s desire to avoid unpleasant collective memories leading to a process of historical amnesia and narrative whitewashing. Photographs taken by Josef Koudelka portray memories of the invasion such as a memorial to the victims set up in Wenceslas Square. There are many omnipresent signs of memorial of the Soviet invasion in the city of Prague.

During the invasion, protesters set up several memorials to record the location of the victims&#x27; death. The Jan Palach memorial is a monument remembering the suicide of a student in 1969. This place is often called the &quot;boulevard of history.&quot; Palach was the first to kill himself in Wenceslas Square but was not the last, he was belonging to a student pact of resistance. There is also (at Újezd, at the bottom of Petrin hill) the memorial for the victims of communism in Prague: a narrowing staircase along which seven male bronze silhouettes descend. The first one, the one at the bottom, is complete, while the others gradually disappear. It aims at representing the same person at different phases of the destruction caused by communist ideology.

=== Conflicted memories ===
The Prague Spring has deeply marked the history of communism in Eastern Europe even though its outcomes were modest. Rather than remembering the cultural democratization, the opening of the press and its impact on the emergence of a new form of socialism, history textbooks consider Prague Spring as one of the major crises of Socialism in the Soviet bloc. The memory has acquired a negative significance as marking disillusion of political hopes within Eastern European communism. Indeed, long hidden and rejected from the collective memory, the Prague Spring of 1968 is rarely commemorated in Prague and is often considered a painful defeat, a symbol of disappointed hope and surrender that heralds twenty years of &#x27;normalisation&#x27;. It was not until the 2000s, following the publication of texts dating from 1968, such as Milan Kundera, &quot;Český úděl&quot; (The Czech Fate), and Václav Havel, &quot;Český úděl?&quot; published in 2007 in the weekly magazine &quot;Literární Noviny (52/1)&quot;, that the debate on the Prague Spring resumed. Indeed, the posterity of the Prague Spring remains first and foremost the memory of the military intervention of the Warsaw Pact as well as the failure of reform within a communist regime, which definitely discredited the Dubcekian &quot;revisionist&quot; perspective in the East. The memory of the Prague Spring is thus largely obscured and often overviewed. Indeed, the Prague Spring also deeply impacted the Czech society and should also be remembered for the cultural momentum that accompanied and illustrated this movement, of which there are still films, novels, and plays. The Prague Spring also influenced a renewal of the Prague artistic and cultural scene as well as a liberalization of society which deeply marked the following years. The 1960s indeed saw the emergence of a major shift in Czechoslovakia with cultural changes and movement coming from the West, notably rock music and sub-cultural movements which are the symbol of cultural renewal for Czechoslovakia. The Czech sixties were thus a process of emancipation of culture from the constraints of existing political structures and were the prelude to the upheavals of 1968. In fact, the regime&#x27;s political crisis did not begin with Dubcek&#x27;s election as party leader on 5 January 1968, but with the break-up speeches delivered at the Writers&#x27; Congress in June 1967 by Ludvík Vaculík, Milan Kundera and Antonín Liehm. In addition, the revitalization of society was also an essential component of the Prague Spring. Indeed, the great achievements of the Prague Spring, i. e. the abolition of censorship, the restoration of individual and collective freedoms... have revitalized society, which has begun to express itself more freely. Although the Prague Spring only restored what had existed thirty years earlier in Czechoslovakia, the spring of 1968 had a profound and long-lasting impact on the society. 

Recently, the anniversary of the 50 years of the conflict raised the question of the memory of the Prague Spring. The European Commission Vice-president Maroš Šefčovič, himself a Slovak, reminded us on the occasion that &quot;&quot;we should never tolerate a breach of international law, crushing people&#x27;s legitimate yearning for freedom and democracy&quot;.&quot; The European justice commissioner Věra Jourová also made a speech. However, the memory is still very conflicted as demonstrated when the Czech Republic&#x27;s pro-Russian President Miloš Zeman refused to attend any ceremony remembering the Prague Spring and didn&#x27;t give any speech in memory of the numerous deaths.

The memory of the Prague Spring is also transmitted through testimonies of former Czechoslovak citizens. In a 2018 article, Radio Free Europe collected testimonies of four women who witnessed the Warsaw Pact troops invasion and bravely acted. Stanislava Draha who volunteered to help some of the 500 wounded testifies says that the invasion had a major impact on her life. Besides, Vera Homolova, a radio reporter broadcasting the invasion from a covert studio testifies &quot;I experienced the Soviet-led troops shooting recklessly into the Czechoslovak Radio&#x27;s building, into windows.&quot; In the aftermath, Vera Roubalova, who reacted as a student to the occupation by demonstrating posters, that tensions were still present towards the countries that occupied Czechoslovakia. On the night of 20–21 August, 137 Czechoslovaks died during the invasion.

<text>Princetown is a village located within Dartmoor national park in the English county of Devon. It is the principal settlement of the civil parish of Dartmoor Forest. At the 2021 census, the village had a population of 1,443.

The village has its origins in 1785, when Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt, then secretary to the Prince of Wales, leased a large area of moorland from the Duchy of Cornwall estate, hoping to convert it into good farmland. He encouraged people to live in the area and suggested that a prison be built there. He called the settlement Princetown after the Prince of Wales.

Princetown is the site of Dartmoor Prison. At around 1,430 feet (435 m) above sea level, it is the highest settlement on the moor, and one of the highest in the United Kingdom. It is also the largest settlement located on the high moor. The Princetown Railway, closed in 1956, was also the highest railway line in England: its Princetown terminus was also 1,430 feet above sea level.

== History ==
In 1780, a farm was reclaimed on the site of an ancient tenement near the Two Bridges, and in 1785, Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt set about improving the moor at a place which he named Tor Royal (present day Tor Royal Farm), about south-east of Princetown. The Plume of Feathers Inn also bears this date on its sign. He made an estate and built a house in 1798. Later, the road from Tavistock to Princetown was built, as well as the other roads that now cross the moor.
He also proposed that a prison be built on Dartmoor to house the thousands of captives of the Napoleonic Wars and the later War of 1812, who had become too numerous to lodge in the prisons and prison-ships at Plymouth. The site was given by the Prince of Wales, who held the lands of the Duchy of Cornwall to which the whole moor belonged. This is why the settlement is named Princetown. Dartmoor Prison was built in 1806 at a cost of £130,000. At one time it had a capacity of between 7,000 and 9,000 prisoners, but its current capacity is only 640.

A small town grew up near the prison. Two large inns were built during the war – the current Prince of Wales and the former Devil&#x27;s Elbow / Railway Inn (now the Ramblers&#x27; Rest Guesthouse). Many of the prisoners had prize money to come from their own country; many others made their own money in their hammocks at night, even forging Bank of England and local bank notes, which they passed off in the great daily market held in the prison. With the closing of the prison in 1816, the town almost collapsed, but the completion of the Princetown Railway in 1823 brought back many people to the granite quarries. The prison remained derelict until 1851, when it was reopened for prisoners serving long sentences. It has since been considerably extended and although other Victorian era prisons are to remain in service, Dartmoor was scheduled to close in 2023, but an extension lease has now been signed to keep it open beyond that date.

In the 1880s an Officers&#x27; Club building was constructed as a rest room for officers and their families. It was extended during the 1970s and remained in use until closure in 2001, largely because very few prison officers lived in Princetown by that date, but commuted in from Plymouth or Tavistock in the main.

The terrace of houses now called Moor Crescent was constructed in 1912 as housing for prison officers of fairly senior rank, in which role it served until the 1980s. After falling into near-derelict condition, it was renovated and is now private housing. Hessary Terrace, which backs onto Moor Crescent, was also constructed as housing for prison officers, as was Heather Terrace.

There is a sports field, now used by Princetown Football Club and known as Legend Park, which formerly belonged to the prison. The sports field and pavilion (now Princetown Pavilion Youth Club) date from the 1890s and were constructed for use by the prison warders. A tennis pavilion was laid out in the 1920s as a base for the tennis court for officers and their families. It was demolished in the 1960s due to its poor state. The bowling green and pavilion were built around the turn of the century and visiting teams of prison staff played matches on many occasions. This was also demolished in the 1960s.

== Geography ==

The village is located on the B3212 road between Yelverton and Two Bridges and is surrounded by moorland. Several footpaths across the moor pass through the village, including one leading west to Sampford Spiney and one leading south to Nun&#x27;s Cross and Erme Head.

Tor Royal Lane is a dead end road which leads down from the village to the site of the disused Whiteworks tin mine, about 2 miles or 3 km to the south-east, which overlooks Fox Tor Mires, the presumed site of the Grimpen Mire to be found in Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s tale &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles.&quot; Conan Doyle stayed at the former Duchy Hotel whilst writing and researching the story with his friend, Bertram Fletcher Robinson. The hotel has long since closed and the building now houses the National Park Visitor Centre which is an all-weather centre and activity hub, with interactive displays, films, exhibitions and a children&#x27;s discovery area.

Other points of interest in the village include the prison museum which was formerly the prison dairy and behind the prison, two cemeteries – one for French prisoners of war and the other for American prisoners of war who died in the prison when it was a war depot during the Napoleonic War in the 19th century. The cemetery around the Church of St Michael and All Angels includes the graves of convicts who died during their incarceration in the prison. The Church of St Michael has the distinction of being the only one in England constructed by POWs and is dedicated, as are many churches in high locations, to St. Michael. It was taken out of use due to structural problems and damp and is now maintained by the Churches Conservation Trust, although the building has been stabilised and made safe. The United Church of Princetown can be found at the other end of the village.

The village is overlooked from the north-west by North Hessary Tor upon which is a tall transmitting mast that provides a useful guide point for walkers from miles around.

== Demography ==
The village is mainly made up of white British people living in a mix of social and private housing. There are currently 74 children enrolled at the primary school which was rated &#x27;Good&#x27; by Ofsted in 2019. The school itself was constructed in 1874 for the children of prison officers. A further 17 children attend the pre-school, which is contained within the Community Centre in its own purpose-built wing. In 2016 the official population estimate was 1447, with a further 640 inmates of the prison. Most people living in Princetown commute to work in Plymouth or Tavistock, but with the expansion of the brewery a few more jobs have been created locally. The population is projected to keep increasing in the future mainly due to the improved amenities within the village itself and the relatively high percentage of young people living there. 
Princetown is undergoing significant regeneration and expansion, with new private housing built at several sites in the village and a football pitch with car parking built behind the Community Centre. High Moorland Visitor Centre has been renamed as the National Park Visitor Centre, and the area outside the centre altered to include artwork and new seating areas.

== Economy ==

In terms of tourism, Princetown is a popular destination and hub for people traversing the moors, and the sight of large groups of hikers, walkers and cyclists is especially common during the summer months. A bunkhouse and camping facilities are available in the village and there are also a handful of local shops. The Dartmoor Ultra Marathon takes place annually, as does the charity Tour de Moor cycle race. The annual Dartmoor Classic cycling sportive regularly passes through Princetown, and the Tour of Britain has passed though as it went across Dartmoor

Princetown has a brewery which used to be housed in the Prince of Wales pub, but now occupies a modern purpose-built building on the edge of the village, close to the former railway. The other pub is the Plume of Feathers (the Railway Inn – &quot;The Devils Elbow&quot; – closed as a pub in 2009 – now the Ramblers&#x27; Rest Guesthouse). In April 2017 the go-ahead was given for the construction of a whisky distillery, which invoked controversy due to the destruction of buildings that this would entail. These are the &#x27;Pocket Power Station&#x27; (the world&#x27;s first unmanned power station, demolished in 2021) and the older power station building that was in use until 1947, and now sits derelict after prior use as a business. As of early 2024, the building is near completion.

In recent years Princetown has seen the opening of both the Princetown Centre for Creativity in Duchy Square, on the site of the former village supermarket, which closed in 2011 but has now re-opened as the Duchy Square Centre, housing business tenants, and a new village community centre opened in 2008, which also houses a GP surgery, library and pre-school.

== Climate ==

Princetown, like the rest of Dartmoor, experiences colder and wetter weather than most of Devon, especially because of its high altitude. Snow is uncommon but is usually heavy when it does fall. According to the Köppen climate classification the climate would be classified as Cfb bordering on Cfc.

== Transport ==
A summer bus service, the Transmoor link (no. 82 bus) between Plymouth and Exeter, used to pass through the village but was axed, but in 2021 the Dartmoor Explorer started operation, running across the moor to Moretonhampstead and onwards to Exeter. There is a daytime service (no. 98 bus) linking Princetown to Yelverton and Tavistock, but only three times a day.

<text>PostgreSQL ( ) also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. PostgreSQL features transactions with atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability (ACID) properties, automatically updatable views, materialized views, triggers, foreign keys, and stored procedures.
It is supported on all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD, and handles a range of workloads from single machines to data warehouses, data lakes, or web services with many concurrent users.

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group focuses only on developing a database engine and closely related components.
This core is, technically, what comprises PostgreSQL itself, but there is an extensive developer community and ecosystem that provides other important feature sets that might, traditionally, be provided by a proprietary software vendor. These include special-purpose database engine features, like those needed to support a geospatial or temporal database or features which emulate other database products. 
Also available from third parties are a wide variety of user and machine interface features, such as graphical user interfaces or load balancing and high availability toolsets.
The large third-party PostgreSQL support network of people, companies, products, and projects, even though not part of The PostgreSQL Development Group, are essential to the PostgreSQL database engine&#x27;s adoption and use and make up the PostgreSQL ecosystem writ large.

PostgreSQL was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the Ingres database developed at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1996, the project was renamed &lt;q&gt;PostgreSQL&lt;/q&gt; to reflect its support for SQL. After a review in 2007, the development team decided to keep the name PostgreSQL and the alias Postgres.

== History ==
PostgreSQL evolved from the Ingres project at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1982, the leader of the Ingres team, Michael Stonebraker, left Berkeley to make a proprietary version of Ingres. He returned to Berkeley in 1985, and began a post-Ingres project to address the problems with contemporary database systems that had become increasingly clear during the early 1980s. He won the Turing Award in 2014 for these and other projects, and techniques pioneered in them.

The new project, POSTGRES, aimed to add the fewest features needed to completely support data types. These features included the ability to define types and to fully describe relationships something used widely, but maintained entirely by the user. In POSTGRES, the database understood relationships, and could retrieve information in related tables in a natural way using &quot;rules&quot;. POSTGRES used many of the ideas of Ingres, but not its code.

Starting in 1986, published papers described the basis of the system, and a prototype version was shown at the 1988 ACM SIGMOD Conference. The team released version 1 to a small number of users in June 1989, followed by version 2 with a re-written rules system in June 1990. Version 3, released in 1991, again re-wrote the rules system, and added support for multiple storage managers and an improved query engine. By 1993, the number of users began to overwhelm the project with requests for support and features. After releasing version 4.2 on June 30, 1994 primarily a cleanup the project ended. Berkeley released POSTGRES under an MIT License variant, which enabled other developers to use the code for any use. At the time, POSTGRES used an Ingres-influenced POSTQUEL query language interpreter, which could be interactively used with a console application named &quot;monitor&quot;. 

In 1994, Berkeley graduate students Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen replaced the POSTQUEL query language interpreter with one for the SQL query language, creating Postgres95. The &quot;monitor&quot; console was also replaced by psql. Yu and Chen announced the first version (0.01) to beta testers on May 5, 1995. Version 1.0 of Postgres95 was announced on September 5, 1995, with a more liberal license that enabled the software to be freely modifiable.

On July 8, 1996, Marc Fournier at Hub.org Networking Services provided the first non-university development server for the open-source development effort. With the participation of Bruce Momjian and Vadim B. Mikheev, work began to stabilize the code inherited from Berkeley.

In 1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL. The online presence at the website PostgreSQL.org began on October 22, 1996. The first PostgreSQL release formed version 6.0 on January 29, 1997. Since then developers and volunteers around the world have maintained the software as The PostgreSQL Global Development Group.

The project continues to make releases available under its free and open-source software PostgreSQL License. Code comes from contributions from proprietary vendors, support companies, and open-source programmers.

== Multiversion concurrency control (MVCC) ==
PostgreSQL manages concurrency through multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), which gives each transaction a &quot;snapshot&quot; of the database, allowing changes to be made without affecting other transactions. This largely eliminates the need for read locks, and ensures the database maintains ACID principles. PostgreSQL offers four levels of transaction isolation: Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read and Serializable. Because PostgreSQL is immune to dirty reads, requesting a Read Uncommitted transaction isolation level provides read committed instead. PostgreSQL supports full serializability via the serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) method. The PostgreSQL MVCC implementation is prone to performance issues that require tuning when under a heavy write load which updates existing rows.

== Storage and replication ==

=== Replication ===
PostgreSQL includes built-in binary replication based on shipping the changes (write-ahead logs (WAL)) to replica nodes asynchronously, with the ability to run read-only queries against these replicated nodes. This allows splitting read traffic among multiple nodes efficiently. Earlier replication software that allowed similar read scaling normally relied on adding replication triggers to the master, increasing load.

PostgreSQL includes built-in synchronous replication that ensures that, for each write transaction, the master waits until at least one replica node has written the data to its transaction log. Unlike other database systems, the durability of a transaction (whether it is asynchronous or synchronous) can be specified per-database, per-user, per-session or even per-transaction. This can be useful for workloads that do not require such guarantees, and may not be wanted for all data as it slows down performance due to the requirement of the confirmation of the transaction reaching the synchronous standby.

Standby servers can be synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous standby servers can be specified in the configuration which determines which servers are candidates for synchronous replication. The first in the list that is actively streaming will be used as the current synchronous server. When this fails, the system fails over to the next in line.

Synchronous multi-master replication is not included in the PostgreSQL core. Postgres-XC which is based on PostgreSQL provides scalable synchronous multi-master replication. It is licensed under the same license as PostgreSQL. A related project is called Postgres-XL. Postgres-R is yet another fork. Bidirectional replication (BDR) is an asynchronous multi-master replication system for PostgreSQL.

Tools such as repmgr make managing replication clusters easier.

Several asynchronous trigger-based replication packages are available. These remain useful even after introduction of the expanded core abilities, for situations where binary replication of a full database cluster is inappropriate:

* Slony-I
* Londiste, part of SkyTools (developed by Skype)
* Bucardo multi-master replication (developed by Backcountry.com)
* SymmetricDS multi-master, multi-tier replication

=== Indexes ===
PostgreSQL includes built-in support for regular B-tree and hash table indexes, and four index access methods: generalized search trees (GiST), generalized inverted indexes (GIN), Space-Partitioned GiST (SP-GiST) and Block Range Indexes (BRIN). In addition, user-defined index methods can be created, although this is quite an involved process. Indexes in PostgreSQL also support the following features:

* Expression indexes can be created with an index of the result of an expression or function, instead of simply the value of a column.
* Partial indexes, which only index part of a table, can be created by adding a WHERE clause to the end of the CREATE INDEX statement. This allows a smaller index to be created.
* The planner is able to use multiple indexes together to satisfy complex queries, using temporary in-memory bitmap index operations (useful for data warehouse applications for joining a large fact table to smaller dimension tables such as those arranged in a star schema).
* &quot;k&quot;-nearest neighbors (&quot;k&quot;-NN) indexing (also referred to KNN-GiST) provides efficient searching of &quot;closest values&quot; to that specified, useful to finding similar words, or close objects or locations with geospatial data. This is achieved without exhaustive matching of values.
* Index-only scans often allow the system to fetch data from indexes without ever having to access the main table.
* Block Range Indexes (BRIN).

=== Schemas ===
PostgreSQL schemas are namespaces, allowing objects of the same kind and name to co-exist in a single database.
They are not to be confused with a
database schema—the abstract, structural, organizational specification which defines how every table&#x27;s data relates to data within other tables.
All PostgreSQL database objects, except for a few global objects such as roles and tablespaces, exist within a schema.
They cannot be nested, schemas cannot contain schemas. 
The permission system controls access to schemas and their content.
By default, newly created databases have only a single schema called &quot;public&quot; but other schemas can be added and the public schema isn&#x27;t mandatory.

A setting determines the order in which PostgreSQL checks schemas for unqualified objects (those without a prefixed schema). By default, it is set to ( refers to the currently connected database user). This default can be set on a database or role level, but as it is a session parameter, it can be freely changed (even multiple times) during a client session, affecting that session only.

Non-existent schemas, or other schemas not accessible to the logged-in user, that are listed in search_path are silently skipped during object lookup.

New objects are created in whichever valid schema (one that can be accessed) appears first in the search_path.

=== Data types ===
A wide variety of native data types are supported, including:

* Boolean
* Arbitrary-precision numerics
* Character (text, varchar, char)
* Binary
* Date/time (timestamp/time with/without time zone, date, interval)
* Money
* Enum
* Bit strings
* Text search type
* Composite
* HStore, an extension enabled key-value store within PostgreSQL
* Arrays (variable-length and can be of any data type, including text and composite types) up to 1 GB in total storage size
* Geometric primitives
* IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
* Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks and MAC addresses
* XML supporting XPath queries
* Universally unique identifier (UUID)
* JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), and a faster binary JSONB (not the same as BSON)

In addition, users can create their own data types which can usually be made fully indexable via PostgreSQL&#x27;s indexing infrastructures GiST, GIN, SP-GiST. Examples of these include the geographic information system (GIS) data types from the PostGIS project for PostgreSQL.

There is also a data type called a &quot;domain&quot;, which is the same as any other data type but with optional constraints defined by the creator of that domain. This means any data entered into a column using the domain will have to conform to whichever constraints were defined as part of the domain.

A data type that represents a range of data can be used which are called range types. These can be discrete ranges (e.g. all integer values 1 to 10) or continuous ranges (e.g., any time between and ). The built-in range types available include ranges of integers, big integers, decimal numbers, time stamps (with and without time zone) and dates.

Custom range types can be created to make new types of ranges available, such as IP address ranges using the inet type as a base, or float ranges using the float data type as a base. Range types support inclusive and exclusive range boundaries using the and characters respectively. (e.g., represents all integers starting from and including 4 up to but not including 9.) Range types are also compatible with existing operators used to check for overlap, containment, right of etc.

=== User-defined objects ===
New types of almost all objects inside the database can be created, including:

* Casts
* Conversions
* Data types
* Data domains
* Functions, including aggregate functions and window functions
* Indexes including custom indexes for custom types
* Operators (existing ones can be overloaded)
* Procedural languages

=== Inheritance ===
Tables can be set to inherit their characteristics from a &quot;parent&quot; table. Data in child tables will appear to exist in the parent tables, unless data is selected from the parent table using the ONLY keyword, i.e. . Adding a column in the parent table will cause that column to appear in the child table.

Inheritance can be used to implement table partitioning, using either triggers or rules to direct inserts to the parent table into the proper child tables.

This feature is not fully supported. In particular, table constraints are not currently inheritable. All check constraints and not-null constraints on a parent table are automatically inherited by its children. Other types of constraints (unique, primary key, and foreign key constraints) are not inherited.

Inheritance provides a way to map the features of generalization hierarchies depicted in entity–relationship diagrams (ERDs) directly into the PostgreSQL database.

=== Other storage features ===
* Referential integrity constraints including foreign key constraints, column constraints, and row checks
* Binary and textual large-object storage
* Tablespaces
* Per-column collation
* Online backup
* Point-in-time recovery, implemented using write-ahead logging
* In-place upgrades with pg_upgrade for less downtime

== Control and connectivity ==

=== Foreign data wrappers ===
PostgreSQL can link to other systems to retrieve data via foreign data wrappers (FDWs).
These can take the form of any data source, such as a file system, another relational database management system (RDBMS), or a web service. This means that regular database queries can use these data sources like regular tables, and even join multiple data-sources together.

=== Interfaces ===
PostgreSQL supports a binary communication protocol that allows applications to connect to the database server. The protocol is versioned (currently 3.0, as of PostgreSQL 7.4) and has a detailed specification.

The official client implementation of this communication protocol is a C API, libpq. In addition, the officially supported ECPG tool allows SQL commands to be embedded in C code. Both are part of the standard PostgreSQL distribution.

Third-party libraries for connecting to PostgreSQL are available for many programming languages, including C++, Java, Julia, Python, Node.js, Go, and Rust.

=== Procedural languages ===
Procedural languages allow developers to extend the database with custom subroutines (functions), often called &quot;stored procedures&quot;. These functions can be used to build database triggers (functions invoked on modification of certain data) and custom data types and aggregate functions. Procedural languages can also be invoked without defining a function, using a DO command at SQL level.

Languages are divided into two groups: Procedures written in &quot;safe&quot; languages are sandboxed and can be safely created and used by any user. Procedures written in &quot;unsafe&quot; languages can only be created by superusers, because they allow bypassing a database&#x27;s security restrictions, but can also access sources external to the database. Some languages like Perl provide both safe and unsafe versions.

PostgreSQL has built-in support for three procedural languages:

* Plain SQL (safe). Simpler SQL functions can get expanded inline into the calling (SQL) query, which saves function call overhead and allows the query optimizer to &quot;see inside&quot; the function.
* Procedural Language/PostgreSQL (PL/pgSQL) (safe), which resembles Oracle&#x27;s Procedural Language for SQL (PL/SQL) procedural language and SQL/Persistent Stored Modules (SQL/PSM).
* C (unsafe), which allows loading one or more custom shared library into the database. Functions written in C offer the best performance, but bugs in code can crash and potentially corrupt the database. Most built-in functions are written in C.

In addition, PostgreSQL allows procedural languages to be loaded into the database through extensions. Three language extensions are included with PostgreSQL to support Perl, Tcl, and Python. For Python, the current is used, and the discontinued is no longer supported as of PostgreSQL 15. Both were supported previously, defaulting to , while old and new versions couldn&#x27;t be used in the same session. External projects provide support for many other languages, including PL/Java, JavaScript (PL/V8), PL/Julia,&lt;ref name=&quot;PL/Julia&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; PL/R, PL/Ruby, and others.

=== Triggers ===
Triggers are events triggered by the action of SQL data manipulation language (DML) statements. For example, an INSERT statement might activate a trigger that checks if the values of the statement are valid. Most triggers are only activated by either INSERT or UPDATE statements.

Triggers are fully supported and can be attached to tables. Triggers can be per-column and conditional, in that UPDATE triggers can target specific columns of a table, and triggers can be told to execute under a set of conditions as specified in the trigger&#x27;s WHERE clause. Triggers can be attached to views by using the INSTEAD OF condition. Multiple triggers are fired in alphabetical order. In addition to calling functions written in the native PL/pgSQL, triggers can also invoke functions written in other languages like PL/Python or PL/Perl.

=== Asynchronous notifications ===
PostgreSQL provides an asynchronous messaging system that is accessed through the NOTIFY, LISTEN and UNLISTEN commands. A session can issue a NOTIFY command, along with the user-specified channel and an optional payload, to mark a particular event occurring. Other sessions are able to detect these events by issuing a LISTEN command, which can listen to a particular channel. This functionality can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as letting other sessions know when a table has updated or for separate applications to detect when a particular action has been performed. Such a system prevents the need for continuous polling by applications to see if anything has yet changed, and reducing unnecessary overhead. Notifications are fully transactional, in that messages are not sent until the transaction they were sent from is committed. This eliminates the problem of messages being sent for an action being performed which is then rolled back.

Many connectors for PostgreSQL provide support for this notification system (including libpq, JDBC, Npgsql, psycopg and node.js) so it can be used by external applications.

PostgreSQL can act as an effective, persistent &quot;pub/sub&quot; server or job server by combining LISTEN with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED.

=== Rules ===
Rules allow the &quot;query tree&quot; of an incoming query to be rewritten; they are an, automatically invoked, macro language for SQL. &quot;Query Re-Write Rules&quot; are attached to a table/class and &quot;Re-Write&quot; the incoming DML (select, insert, update, and/or delete) into one or more queries that either replace the original DML statement or execute in addition to it. Query Re-Write occurs after DML statement parsing and before query planning.

The functionality rules provide was, in almost every way, later duplicated with the introduction of newer types of triggers.
The use of triggers is usually preferred over rules as it is easier to reason about trigger behavior and interactions than when equivalent rules are used.

=== Other querying features ===
* Transactions
* Full-text search
* Views
** Materialized views
** Updateable views
** Recursive views
* Inner, outer (full, left, and right), and cross joins
* Sub-selects
** Correlated sub-queries
* Regular expressions
* Common table expressions and writable common table expressions
* Encrypted connections via Transport Layer Security (TLS); current versions do not use vulnerable SSL, even with that configuration option
* Domains
* Savepoints
* Two-phase commit
* The Oversized-Attribute Storage Technique (TOAST) is used to transparently store large table attributes (such as big MIME attachments or XML messages) in a separate area, with automatic compression.
* Embedded SQL is implemented using preprocessor. SQL code is first written embedded into C code. Then code is run through ECPG preprocessor, which replaces SQL with calls to code library. Then code can be compiled using a C compiler. Embedding works also with C++ but it does not recognize all C++ constructs.

=== Concurrency model ===
PostgreSQL server is process-based (not threaded), and uses one operating system process per database session. Multiple sessions are automatically spread across all available CPUs by the operating system. Many types of queries can also be parallelized across multiple background worker processes, taking advantage of multiple CPUs or cores. Client applications can use threads and create multiple database connections from each thread.

== Security ==
PostgreSQL manages its internal security on a per-role basis. A role is generally regarded to be a user (a role that can log in), or a group (a role of which other roles are members). Permissions can be granted or revoked on any object down to the column level, and can allow or prevent the visibility/creation/alteration/deletion of objects at the database, schema, table, and row levels.

PostgreSQL&#x27;s SECURITY LABEL feature (extension to SQL standards), allows for additional security; with a bundled loadable module that supports label-based mandatory access control (MAC) based on Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) security policy.

PostgreSQL natively supports a broad number of external authentication mechanisms, including:

* Password: either SCRAM-SHA-256, MD5 or plain-text
* Generic Security Services Application Program Interface (GSSAPI)
* Security Support Provider Interface (SSPI)
* Kerberos
* ident (maps O/S user-name as provided by an ident server to database user-name)
* Peer (maps local user name to database user name)
* Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
** Active Directory (AD)
* RADIUS
* Certificate
* Pluggable authentication module (PAM)

The GSSAPI, SSPI, Kerberos, peer, ident and certificate methods can also use a specified &quot;map&quot; file that lists which users matched by that authentication system are allowed to connect as a specific database user.

These methods are specified in the cluster&#x27;s host-based authentication configuration file (pg_hba.conf), which determines what connections are allowed. This allows control over which user can connect to which database, where they can connect from (IP address, IP address range, domain socket), which authentication system will be enforced, and whether the connection must use Transport Layer Security (TLS).

== Standards compliance ==
PostgreSQL claims high, but not complete, conformance with the latest SQL standard (&quot;as of the version 17 release in September 2024, PostgreSQL conforms to at least 170 of the 177 mandatory features for Core conformance&quot;, and no other databases fully conformed to it). One exception is the handling of unquoted identifiers like table or column names. In PostgreSQL they are folded, internally, to lower case characters whereas the standard says that unquoted identifiers should be folded to upper case. Thus, should be equivalent to not according to the standard. Other shortcomings concern the absence of temporal tables allowing automatic logging of row versions during transactions with the possibility of browsing in time (FOR SYSTEM TIME predicate), although relatively SQL compliant third-party extensions are available.

== Benchmarks and performance ==

Many informal performance studies of PostgreSQL have been done. Performance improvements aimed at improving scalability began heavily with version 8.1. Simple benchmarks between version 8.0 and version 8.4 showed that the latter was more than ten times faster on read-only workloads and at least 7.5 times faster on both read and write workloads.

The first industry-standard and peer-validated benchmark was completed in June 2007, using the Sun Java System Application Server (proprietary version of GlassFish) 9.0 Platform Edition, UltraSPARC T1-based Sun Fire server and PostgreSQL 8.2. This result of 778.14 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard compares favourably with the 874 JOPS@Standard with Oracle 10 on an Itanium-based HP-UX system.

In August 2007, Sun submitted an improved benchmark score of 813.73 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard. With the system under test at a reduced price, the price/performance improved from $84.98/JOPS to $70.57/JOPS.

The default configuration of PostgreSQL uses only a small amount of dedicated memory for performance-critical purposes such as caching database blocks and sorting. This limitation is primarily because older operating systems required kernel changes to allow allocating large blocks of shared memory. PostgreSQL.org provides advice on basic recommended performance practice in a wiki.

In April 2012, Robert Haas of EnterpriseDB demonstrated PostgreSQL 9.2&#x27;s linear CPU scalability using a server with 64 cores.

Matloob Khushi performed benchmarking between PostgreSQL 9.0 and MySQL 5.6.15 for their ability to process genomic data. In his performance analysis he found that PostgreSQL extracts overlapping genomic regions eight times faster than MySQL using two datasets of 80,000 each forming random human DNA regions. Insertion and data uploads in PostgreSQL were also better, although general searching ability of both databases was almost equivalent.

== Platforms ==
PostgreSQL is available for the following operating systems: Linux (all recent distributions), 64-bit ARM and x86-64 installers available and tested for macOS version 10.14 and newer, Windows (with installers available and tested for 64-bit Windows Server 2022 and 2016), FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonFlyBSD, and these without official (though unofficial likely available) binary executables, Solaris, and illumos.

PostgreSQL can be expected to work on any of the following instruction set architectures (and operating systems): 64-bit x86-64 and 32-bit x86 on Windows and other operating systems; these are supported on other than Windows: 64-bit ARM and the older 32-bit ARM, including older such as ARMv6 in Raspberry Pi), RISC-V, z/Architecture, S/390, PowerPC (incl. 64-bit Power ISA), SPARC (also 64-bit), MIPS and PA-RISC. It was also known to work on some other platforms (while not been tested on for years, i.e. for latest versions).

== Database administration ==
Open source front-ends and tools for administering PostgreSQL include:

; psql: The primary front-end for PostgreSQL is the command-line program, which can be used to enter SQL queries directly, or execute them from a file. In addition, psql provides a number of meta-commands and various shell-like features to facilitate writing scripts and automating a wide variety of tasks; for example tab completion of object names and SQL syntax.
; pgAdmin: The pgAdmin package is a free and open-source graphical user interface (GUI) administration tool for PostgreSQL, which is supported on many computer platforms. The program is available in more than a dozen languages. The first prototype, named pgManager, was written for PostgreSQL 6.3.2 from 1998, and rewritten and released as pgAdmin under the GNU General Public License (GPL) in later months. The second incarnation (named pgAdmin II) was a complete rewrite, first released on January 16, 2002. The third version, pgAdmin III, was originally released under the Artistic License and then released under the same license as PostgreSQL. Unlike prior versions that were written in Visual Basic, pgAdmin III is written in C++, using the wxWidgets framework allowing it to run on most common operating systems. The query tool includes a scripting language called pgScript for supporting admin and development tasks. In December 2014, Dave Page, the pgAdmin project founder and primary developer, announced that with the shift towards web-based models, work has begun on pgAdmin 4 with the aim to facilitate cloud deployments. In 2016, pgAdmin 4 was released. The pgAdmin 4 backend was written in Python, using Flask and the Qt framework.
; phpPgAdmin: phpPgAdmin is a web-based administration tool for PostgreSQL written in PHP and based on the popular phpMyAdmin interface originally written for MySQL administration.
; PostgreSQL Studio: PostgreSQL Studio allows users to perform essential PostgreSQL database development tasks from a web-based console. PostgreSQL Studio allows users to work with cloud databases without the need to open firewalls.
; TeamPostgreSQL: AJAX/JavaScript-driven web interface for PostgreSQL. Allows browsing, maintaining and creating data and database objects via a web browser. The interface offers tabbed SQL editor with autocompletion, row editing widgets, click-through foreign key navigation between rows and tables, &quot;favorites&quot; management for commonly used scripts, among other features. Supports SSH for both the web interface and the database connections. Installers are available for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux, and a simple cross-platform archive that runs from a script.
; LibreOffice, OpenOffice.org: LibreOffice and OpenOffice.org Base can be used as a front-end for PostgreSQL.
; pgBadger: The pgBadger PostgreSQL log analyzer generates detailed reports from a PostgreSQL log file.
; pgDevOps: pgDevOps is a suite of web tools to install &amp; manage multiple PostgreSQL versions, extensions, and community components, develop SQL queries, monitor running databases and find performance problems.
; Adminer: Adminer is a simple web-based administration tool for PostgreSQL and others, written in PHP.
; pgBackRest: pgBackRest is a backup and restore tool for PostgreSQL that provides support for full, differential, and incremental backups.
; pgaudit: pgaudit is a PostgreSQL extension that provides detailed session and/or object audit logging via the standard logging facility provided by PostgreSQL.
; WAL-E: WAL-E is a backup and restore tool for PostgreSQL that provides support for physical (WAL-based) backups, written in Python.
; DBeaver: DBeaver is a free and open source GUI administration tool for PostgreSQL, it has Visual Entity Diagrams and Intellisense features. It also has a commercial PRO license. 

A number of companies offer proprietary tools for PostgreSQL. They often consist of a universal core that is adapted for various specific database products. These tools mostly share the administration features with the open source tools but offer improvements in data modeling, importing, exporting or reporting.

== Notable users ==

<text>Pope Adrian II (; also Hadrian II; 79214 December 872) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 867 to his death. He continued the policy of his predecessor, Nicholas I. Despite seeking good relations with Louis II of Italy, he was placed under surveillance, and his wife and daughters were killed by Louis&#x27; supporters.

==Family==
Adrian was a member of a noble Roman family, related to Popes Stephen IV and Sergius II. In his youth, he married a woman named Stephania and had a daughter with her. Adrian later became a priest after having already been married. Catholic priests had been required to abstain from all further sexual relations since the 4th century at the latest.

Adrian was selected to become pope on 14 December 867. He was already at an advanced age (75), and objected to assuming the papacy. His wife and daughter moved with him to the Lateran Palace.

==Pontificate==
Adrian II maintained, but with less energy, the policies of his predecessor, Nicholas I. King Lothair II of Lotharingia, who died in 869, left Adrian to mediate between the Frankish kings with a view to secure the imperial inheritance to Lothair&#x27;s brother, Louis II of Italy. Adrian sought to maintain good relations with Louis, since the latter&#x27;s campaigns in southern Italy had the potential to free the papacy from the threat posed by the Muslims.

Patriarch Photius I of Constantinople, shortly after the council in which he had pronounced sentence of deposition against Pope Nicholas I, was driven from the patriarchate by a new Byzantine emperor, Basil the Macedonian, who favoured Photius&#x27; rival, Ignatius. The Fourth Council of Constantinople was convoked to decide this matter. At this council, Adrian was represented by legates who presided at the condemnation of Photius as a heretic, but did not succeed in coming to an understanding with Ignatius on the subject of jurisdiction over the Bulgarian Church.

Adrian supported the work of Cyril and Methodius in Moravia, and authorized the use of the new Slavic liturgy. He subsequently ordained Methodius a priest. In 869, he consecrated Methodius archbishop and Metropolitan of Sirmium.

Like Nicholas I, Adrian was forced to submit in temporal affairs to the interference of Emperor Louis II, who placed him under the surveillance of Bishop Arsenius of Orte, his confidential adviser, and Arsenius&#x27; nephew, Anastasius the Librarian. Arsenius&#x27; son Eleutherius married Adrian&#x27;s daughter, having withheld the fact that he was already espoused to another. In 868, he abducted and murdered Adrian&#x27;s wife and daughter. Eleutherius was condemned to death for his crimes.

Adrian died on 14 December 872, after exactly five years of pontificate.

<text>Pope Adrian III or Hadrian III ( or &quot;Hadrianus&quot;; died July 885) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 17 May 884 to his death. He served for little more than a year, during which he worked to help the people of Italy in a very troubled time of famine and war.

== Background==
Adrian III was born in Rome. According to Jean Mabillon, his birth name was Agapitus. Reginald L. Poole believes that Mabillon confused Adrian III, who succeeded Marinus I, with Agapetus II, who succeeded Marinus II a century later. 

==Pontificate==
Adrian laboured hard to alleviate the misery of the people of Italy, prey to famine and to continuous war. He is also known to have written a letter condemning the Christians of both Muslim-ruled and Christian-ruled parts of Spain for being too friendly with the Jews in these lands. Adrian also sent Theodosius, the bishop of Brindisi and Oria, to Constantinople to deliver a synodal letter about faith and the filioque to patriarch Photius I.

Adrian died in July 885 at San Cesario sul Panaro (Modena), not long after embarking on a trip to Worms, in the Rhineland. The purpose of the journey was to attend an Imperial Diet after being summoned by Emperor Charles the Fat to settle the imperial succession and discuss the rising power of the Saracens.

Adrian&#x27;s death and subsequent burial in the church of San Silvestro Nonantola Abbey near Modena is commemorated in the sculpted reliefs () that frame the doorway of this church. His relics are found near the high altar, and his tomb at once became a popular place of pilgrimage. His cult was confirmed by Pope Leo XIII on 2 June 1891, and his feast day is celebrated on 8 July. Orthodox Feasts dates are 8 and 30 July.

<doc id="23827" wikidata="Q103389" url="?curid=23827" title="Pope Agapetus II">
<text>Pope Agapetus II (died 8 November 955) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from 10 May 946 to his death. A nominee of the princeps of Rome, Alberic II of Spoleto, his pontificate occurred during the period known as the &quot;Saeculum obscurum&quot;.

==Pontificate==
He was elected pope on 10 May 946 after the death of Marinus II. The existence of an independent republic of Rome, ruled by Alberic II of Spoleto, meant that Agapetus was prevented from exercising any temporal or secular power in Rome and the Papal States. The struggle between Berengar II and Otto I for the Kingdom of Italy allowed Alberic to exercise complete control over Rome and Agapetus, meaning the pope was largely limited to managing internal church affairs. Even Agapetus’ invitation to Otto to intervene in Italian affairs in 951 was done at the instigation of Alberic, who was growing concerned at Berengar&#x27;s growing power. However, when Otto&#x27;s envoys, the bishops of Mainz and Chur, were sent to the pope to discuss Otto&#x27;s reception in Rome and other more important questions, they were turned away by Alberic.

Agapetus was forced to intervene in the dispute over the occupancy of the See of Reims. He ordered a synod to be held at Ingelheim in June 948 to resolve the rights of the rival claimants, Hugh of Vermandois and Artald of Reims. He sent his legate Marinus of Bomarzo to act on his behalf, while Agapetus wrote to a number of bishops, asking them to be present at the council. Through his legate the pope indicated his support for King Louis IV of France, and gave his support for reinstalling Artald as bishop of Reims. This council was followed up by another one at Trier, where Agapetus was again represented by Marinus of Bomarzo. In 949, Agapetus held a synod in Rome, which confirmed the rulings of the two councils. It condemned the former bishop Hugh and it excommunicated his father, Count Herbert II of Vermandois, for his opposition to King Louis IV.

After receiving requests from both Louis IV of France and Otto I of Germany, Agapetus granted privileges to monasteries and nunneries within their respective kingdoms. He also was sympathetic towards Otto&#x27;s plans to restructure the bishoprics within Germany, which were eventually aborted due to pressure exerted by William of Mainz. Around 948, Agapetus, granted the Archbishop of Hamburg the right of consecrating bishops in Denmark and other northern European countries instead of the pope. The pope was also allegedly asked by a Danish king named Frode, now considered legendary, to send missionaries to his kingdom.

Agapetus was also asked to intervene in a dispute between Herhold, archbishop of Salzburg and Gerard, bishop of Lauriacum, who both claimed the title of metropolitan of all Pannonia. Agapetus dispatched a letter to the two claimants, in which he stated that the diocese of Lauriacum had been the metropolitan church of all Pannonia before the invasion of the Huns. However, following the ravages inflicted by them, the metropolitan had transferred his see to another city, and since that time Salzburg had been raised to an archbishopric. Consequently, both lawfully occupied their respective sees, and both were to retain their rank and diocese. Agapetus ruled that jurisdiction over western Pannonia would rest with Herhold, while the eastern part, along with the regions occupied by the Avars and the Moravians, would fall under Gerard.

In Italy, Agapetus wrote to the dukes of Beneventum and Capua, demanding that monasteries be returned to the monks whom they had displaced. He also deposed the bishops of Termoli and Trivento who were accused of simony. Hoping to rejuvenate the religious life of the clerics in Italy, Agapetus, with the blessing of Alberic, asked for the abbot of Gorze Abbey to send some of his monks down and join the monastic community attached to the church of Saint Paul Outside the Walls.

Agapetus died on 8 November 955, and was succeeded by Alberic&#x27;s son, Octavian, who took the papal name of John XII. He was buried in the Lateran basilica, behind the apse, and close to the tombs of Leo V and Paschal II. Agapetus was noted for his caution and for the sanctity with which he led his life.

<doc id="23828" wikidata="Q132845" url="?curid=23828" title="Pope Adrian IV">
<text>Pope Adrian IV (; born Nicholas Breakspear (or Brekespear); 1 September 1159, also Hadrian IV) was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 4 December 1154 to his death in 1159. He is the only Englishman to have been pope.

Adrian was born in Hertfordshire, England, but little is known of his early life. Although he does not appear to have received a great degree of schooling, while still a youth he travelled to the south of France where he was schooled in Arles, studying law. He then travelled to Avignon, where he joined the Abbey of Saint-Ruf. There he became a canon regular and was eventually appointed abbot. He travelled to Rome several times, where he appears to have caught the attention of Pope Eugene III, and was sent on a mission to Catalonia where the Reconquista was attempting to reclaim land from the Muslim Al-Andalus. Around this time his abbey complained to Eugene that Breakspear was too heavy a disciplinarian, and in order to make use of him as a papal legate as well as to pacify his monks, he was appointed Bishop of Albano some time around 1149.

As bishop, Breakspear was soon sent on another diplomatic mission, this time to Scandinavia. In the middle of a civil war, Breakspear reorganised the Church in Norway and then moved on to Sweden. Here, he was very much acclaimed by the people, and when he left, chroniclers called him a saint. Breakspear returned to Rome in 1154; Eugene&#x27;s successor Pope Anastasius IV had died only a few weeks previously. 

For reasons now unknown, but possibly at his predecessor&#x27;s request, Breakspear was elected next pope by the cardinals. He was unable to complete his coronation service, however, because of the parlous state of politics in Rome, which at the time was a den of &#x27;heresy&#x27; and republicanism. Adrian decisively restored the papal authority there, but his other major policy issue—relations with the newly crowned Holy Roman emperor, Frederick I—started off badly and got progressively worse. Each party, as a result of a particular aggravating incident, found something to condemn the other for. As a result, Adrian entered into an alliance with the Byzantine emperor, Manuel I Komnenos who was keen to re-assert his authority in the south of Italy, but was unable to do so due to the Norman kings&#x27; occupation of the region, now under William I of Sicily.

Adrian&#x27;s alliance with the Byzantine emperor came to nothing, as William decisively defeated Manuel and forced Adrian to come to terms at the Treaty of Benevento. This alienated Emperor Frederick even more, as he saw it as a repudiation of their existing treaty. Relations soured further when Frederick laid claim to a large swathe of territory in northern Italy. Adrian&#x27;s relations with his country of birth, however, seem to have remained generally good. Certainly, he showered St Albans Abbey with privileges, and he appears to have forwarded King Henry II&#x27;s policies where he could. Most famously, in 1158 Adrian is supposed to have granted Henry the papal bull &quot;Laudabiliter&quot;, which is thought to have authorised Henry to invade Ireland. Henry did not do so, however, for another 14 years, and scholars are uncertain whether the bull ever existed.

Following Adrian&#x27;s death at Anagni, there was uncertainty as to who to succeed him, with both pro- and anti-imperial cardinals voting for different candidates. Although Pope Alexander III officially took over, the subsequent election of an antipope led to a 22-year-long schism. Scholars have debated Adrian&#x27;s pontificate widely. Much of a positive nature—his building programme and reorganisation of papal finances, for example—has been identified, particularly in the context of such a short reign. He was also up against powerful forces out of his control, which, while he never overcame them, he managed effectively.

==Early life==
The son of Richard Breakspear, his family was a relatively humble one. The exact year of his birth is unknown but he was probably around 55 years old on his election. Little is known of his background, and that which is, comments Brooke, &quot;savour[s] of gossip rather than sober history.&quot; He was probably born in or around the Hertfordshire town of St Albans. As a result, much of that that is thought to be known may well be mythological &quot;tradition woven at the great abbey&quot; there. It has been suggested that he was born in the hamlet of Bedmond in the parish of Abbots Langley. Much of what is known is brought to historians by the writings of Cardinal Boso and William of Newburgh, both of whom were, however, writing over 30 years after Breakspear&#x27;s death. As a result, notes Poole, there is a dearth of information—and especially dates—for Breakspear&#x27;s life until his election as pope, and &quot;all that can be said is that the dates commonly given are in every instance wrong&quot;. The English chronicler Matthew Paris says he came from Abbots Langley, although Paris mistakenly ascribes to his father the name Robert de Camera. Robert may have been a clerk although Sayers suggests that Paris&#x27; claim that Robert was a priest is probably correct, as is the likelihood that he later became a monk. As such, there are grounds for believing Nicholas to have been illegitimate. Nicholas had a brother called either Ranulf or Randall, a clerk in Feering, Essex. Paris is also the source for Nicholas&#x27; surname being Breakspear.

Paris recounts a story that Nicholas was rejected by Abbot Robert de Gorron from taking his novitiate at the abbey, although as Poole points out, the story is demonstrably incorrect as Robert did not become abbot until 1151. Sayers, suggests that, true or not, during and after Breakspear&#x27;s pontificate, &quot;certainly St Albans fed upon the story of the local boy who had made good&quot;. William of Newburgh reports that Nicholas was too poor to receive anything more than a rudimentary education, and Brooke speculates that he travelled to France to learn the skills of a clerk. This was, he notes, a normal path to preferment in the 12th century, although it was more unusual for those that did so to have Breakspear&#x27;s inauspicious background. He may have become a canon at the Augustinian priory in Merton, Surrey. Poole subscribes to this theory, citing a letter to Breakspear when pope in which he is reminded that &quot;your worship was wont to speak&quot; of Merton in conversation.

===Move to France and promotion===

The next point at which Breakspear can be positively identified is in the Southern French town of Arles, where he continued his studies in canon law, and probably under the masters of Roman law also. On completion of his studies he became a canon regular at the Abbey of Saint-Ruf in Avignon, around to the north of Arles. He was soon appointed prior and then abbot of St Ruf. While still a canon, in 1140 he appears to have written a charter in Barcelona. However, there appear to have been complaints that he was overly strict, and the monks rebelled. As a result, he was summoned to Rome; a temporary peace was established, but it was not long until the monks rebelled again. Breakspear may have visited Rome three times while at St Ruf—&quot;each time with more conspicuous success&quot;—and which would have consumed many months of his time.

Sayers suggests that it was while Breakspear was at St Ruf that he attracted the attention of Pope Eugenius III, who saw in him useful leadership qualities. It is known that in 1147, while Eugenius was in Vico he granted one &quot;N. abbot of St Rufus&quot;. It was probably in 1148 that Breakspear met who would become his good friend, John of Salisbury, in Rheims, and soon after when Eugenius appointed him Cardinal-Bishop of Albano, making Adrian at the time only the second Englishman to have been promoted to that rank. in which capacity he attended the Council of Reims in November 1148. Poole suggests that Breakspear&#x27;s promotion was Eugenius&#x27; method of alleviating the monks&#x27; complaints, as Eugenius told them to &quot;go forth [and] elect you a father with whom ye can or will live in peace; he [Breakspear] shall no longer be a burthen to you&quot;. When Breakspear was later pope, however, he seemed to favour St Ruf well, for example authorising them to send a delegation to the chapter of Pisa Cathedral to cut stone and columns. The chapter was requested, says Egger, to &quot;help them in every possible way to conduct their business&quot;.

Poole questions the reasoning for Breakspear&#x27;s episcopal promotion. Not only was his abbey an obscure one, with little political value or great endowment, but Breakspear&#x27;s reasons for attending the Papal court were unlikely to have enabled him to make a name for himself. Indeed, on at least one occasion it was in response to a summons concerning his behaviour. However, suggest Poole, a possible explanation may have its roots in Breakspear&#x27;s residency at Merton. Duggan notes that the Cardinal Bishopric of Albino was part of the Pope&#x27;s inner circle, which she suggests makes his rapid elevation to such a sensitive position all the more remarkable and indicative of the now-unrecognisable qualities that Eugenius saw in him.

===Voyage to Catalonia===
It was probably at the Council of Reims that Eugenius selected Breakspear for a mission to Catalonia, possibly as a kind of unofficial legate to the crusaders. Breakspear met Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona who had been waging the latest campaign against the Moors since 1147. Although no records exist to show Breakspear was involved in the campaign itself, he was heavily involved in the reorganisation and administration of the Cistercian Order, as well as arbitrating disputes within its congregation. It is likely that he was present at the Siege of Lleida during the summer of 1149. He is less likely to have still been there in October, when it fell, as he had returned to Rome by December. However, he may well have brought news of another successful siege—that of Tortosa—which would have been particularly welcome to the &quot;bruised and battered&quot; papacy of Eugenius, says Damian Smith. Smith also notes that Breakspear&#x27;s lengthy absence from St Ruf may have been a source of complaint by his monks, &quot;but this was surely not of prime importance to the Pope&quot;. Egger suggests, however, that Breakspear&#x27;s Catalonian mission was of great benefit to St Ruf, which became the blueprint for the religious houses created by Berenguer in the wake of the retreating Muslim empire.

Around mid-1152, he was despatched to Scandinavia as Papal legate.

===Visit to Scandinavia, 1152===

Former Canon residentiary of St Albans Abbey, Andes Bergquist has described Breakspear&#x27;s journey to northern Europe as &quot;one of the better documented&quot; of his career. It is possible that Boso—from whom much of the information comes—was in his entourage, although this is not certain. On his arrival, Norway was in a state of civil war and the authority of the King, Inge I, was neither strong nor respected. Breakspear reconciled the warring factions—albeit temporarily—and restored the monarchy. although no official record of his instructions survives, Bergquist suggests that they can be inferred from his actions: to divide the existing Archbishopric of Lund—which covered both Norway and Sweden–into two distinct national metropolitans, to arrange payment of Peter&#x27;s Pence and to generally reorganise the church along Italian and European lines.

Breakspear may have travelled to Norway via France and England—where, Sayers speculates, he could have recruited merchant contacts who knew the region. His mission may have been kept quiet, as Bergquist notes his arrival seems to have been unexpected: Archbishop Eskil of Lund had recently left to visit France, and the King of Norway was on a military campaign. His first stop was Norway. At some point, Breakspear presided over a council at Nidaros. This council, says Robinson, &quot;strengthened the economic position of the church and the social status of the clergy&quot;. Its timing though is difficult to ascertain, says Bergquist: Autumn 1152 seems to allow too little time to organise such a major council following his arrival, yet much later and the depth of a Norwegian winter is even more unlikely.

The focal point of the cult of St Olaf, Nidaros had until that point been only an episcopate. Adrian&#x27;s council was intended to promulgate canons. To this end Breakspear made Nidaros a geographically extensive ecclesiastical province, covering the whole of Norway, Iceland and Greenland, as well as the Faroe, Orkney and Shetland Islands. Breakspear also authorised the expansion of what was to become Europe&#x27;s most northerly medieval cathedral, and its largest. While in Norway he founded three cathedral schools, at Nidaros in 1152 and two more at Bergen and Hamar the following year. His work in Norway earned him the praise of contemporary Icelandic writer and politician, Snorri Sturluson.

If the Council of Nidaros was held in the early months of 1153, suggests Bergquist, then it appears that Breakspear sailed to Sweden as soon as it was concluded. His activities in Sweden followed a similar course to those in Norway. He called another council, this time at Linköping, which reorganised the Swedish church under the Archbishop of Lund (it had previously been subject to German patriarchy). He also received permission from the Swedish monarchy to introduce Peter&#x27;s pence and to reduce the influence of the lay community on the church generally. His visit to Sweden was recorded by contemporary chroniclers and published in the 13th century. Similarly to what he had done in Norway with Trondheim, Adrian attempted to create an archepiscopal see in Sweden. The Swedes and the Geats could not come into an agreement on the location of the see, and the venture came to nothing. According to Bergquist, Breakspear &quot;was taken aback by this unseemly conflict, and declared that neither people deserved this highest ecclesiastical honour&quot;. Indeed, he suggests that it is possible that Breakspear&#x27;s plans fell through thanks to the machinations of the recently returned Archbishop Eskil. Eskil, having discovered that he had lost half his archepiscopate in his absence, may have stirred up the Swedes&#x27; and Geats&#x27; rivalries to ensure against losing any more. In the event, Breakspear appears to have repaired relations with Eskil, assuring him that Eskil would receive far more than he had lost. As a result, he placed Eskil in charge of the new Swedish metropolitan.

Duggan describes Adrian&#x27;s legation in the north has a &quot;diplomatic triumph&quot;, being so successful, says Sayers, &quot;that he was later seen as the apostle of Scandinavia&quot;. Boso later lauded how Breakspear brought &quot;peace to the kingdoms, law to the barbarians, tranquillity to the monasteries, order to the churches, discipline to the clergy and a people pleasing to God, devoted to good works&quot;. He successfully introduced a new Scandinavian tythe—the &quot;denarium sancti Petri&quot;, or payment to St Peter—a financial acknowledgement by the Scandinavian church of Papal primacy. Breakspear, argues the scholar Andrew Beck, &quot;gave the Swedish church its hierarchy and its attachment to Rome&quot;. He left Scandinavia in autumn 1154; he seems to have left a generally good impression in the region: A later saga refers to Breakspear as &quot;the good cardinal...now considered a saint&quot;. On his return to Rome he found Pope Eugenius had died the previous year, and that his successor had followed him only a few weeks before; the College of Cardinals was seeking a successor.

==Political background==

Discussing the broader political context of the time, the historian Anne Duggan argues that &quot;the Pope was not master of his own house&quot;. Likewise, Walter Ullmann has argued that the age was a radical one, in which the temporal power—specifically, the &quot;educated lay element&quot;—was encroaching upon traditional spiritual realms.

Eugenius had died in July 1153. His successor, Anastasius IV, had been already elderly when elected to succeed him, and only ruled for a year. Comparing the two, the popular historian John Julius Norwich comments that the former &quot;was old and ineffectual, concerned chiefly with his own self-glorification&quot;; Adrian, though, was &quot;a man of very different calibre&quot;. Anastasius died on 3 December 1154, and by which time, Breakspear had returned to Rome. Even before the death of Eugenius, argues Barber, &quot;a new and formidable figure had appeared&quot; on the political scene. The Hohenstaufen Frederick Barbarossa had been elected Holy Roman Emperor on 4 March 1152. Barbarossa and Eugenius had contracted, at the Treaty of Constance, to unite against both William of Sicily and the Roman Commune. 

Ullmann has identified four major areas of concern for Adrian at the beginning of his pontificate: the city of Rome under Arnold of Brescia, the new emperor who was marching towards Rome for his coronation, his counterpart in the east whose army had recently invaded southern Italy, and restlessness among the Pope&#x27;s own vassals in his patrimony. By the time of Adrian&#x27;s consecration, the city of Rome was a major player in Papal-Aristocratic regional politics. Under the governance of a republican commune since 1144, Pope Eugenius had recognised it the following year. While the city was usually happy to acknowledge the feudal lordship of the Pope, it was—even compared to other Italian city states—both &quot;unusually self-aware, and also unusually idiosyncratic&quot; compared to others. The commune was hostile to the Papacy. 
The Papacy was weak in the city of Rome. The heretic, Arnold of Brescia, had ruled since 1146 and was popular. He also had the support of the Roman Commune. The popularity of Arnold directly translated into hostility towards the popes. Chichele Professor Chris Wickham describes the relationship between the Pope and the lords of his Patrimony as one in which, because &quot;their lords did not by any means all look to Rome [they] had to be coaxed back or brought back by force&quot;. Papal politics was beset by problems at home and abroad. The election of Adrian IV as Pope, comments the papal scholar Ian S. Robinson—and, indeed, the elections of his immediate predecessors—&quot;took place in the shadow of the communal revolution in Rome&quot;.

From Eugenius, Adrian inherited what Walter Ullmann has called a &quot;mutual assistance pact&quot; with the Emperor, the Treaty of Constance, signed the year of Eugenius&#x27; death. For the popes, its most important aspect was the stipulation that the crowning of the next emperor was contingent on expelling Arnold of Brescia from Rome. It also assured each party of the other&#x27;s support against both King William in Sicily and the Byzantine Empire when necessary. The treaty was confirmed by Adrian in January 1155. Eugenius was a believer in the Gregorian doctrine of Papal supremacy, stating that Christ &quot;gave to St Peter the keys of the kingdom of heaven, the power of both the earthly and the heavenly empire&quot;. From the beginning of his reign, Barbarossa sought to present himself as the heir to a long, established line of Roman Emperors, and likewise that his empire was a continuation of theirs. The historian Anne A. Latowsky explains how this was the cause of tension in the European polity:

Norwich argues that, by now, whatever the public statements of either Papal or Imperial party, they were mutually antagonistic, and had been for many years. Even before Adrian&#x27;s pontificate, he says, no peace treaty was strong enough to unite them for long: &quot;The days when it had been realistic to speak of the two swords of Christendom were gone—gone since Gregory VII and Henry IV had hurled depositions and anathemas at each other nearly a hundred years before&quot;. The situation, suggest Duggan, was &quot;a minefield&quot;, for the Pope, and Adrian had to negotiate it.

It was the ambition of the Emperor of the Eastern Empire, Manuel I Kommenus, to reunite both Empires under one crown, and, as such, he wished to be crowned by the Pope in Rome, as Western emperors were. The death of Roger II presented Manuel with an opportunity he could not afford to let by, argues Professor Paul Magdalino. The Kingdom of Sicily had been recognised by Innocent II in 1143, notes the Italianist Graham Loud, but &quot;relations with the Papacy remained fraught&quot;. The previous King of Sicily, Roger II, had ruled his kingdom with an iron fist, and his nobility chafed, particularly the large number he had effectively dispossessed. His son was less interested than his father in the minutiae of government, and when Roger died in 1154 they took advantage of the new king and rebelled. This was of interest to the Papacy as the rebels were willing to ally themselves with anyone for their purpose.

==Election, 1154==

It was Breakspear&#x27;s being &quot;in the right place at the right time&quot;, suggests the Papal librarian Bradford Lee Eden, that led to his election as pope on Saturday, 4 December 1154, although Duggan argues that he must also have had exceptional qualities, both to reach the rank he had and as seen in his Scandinavian trip—or as William of Newburgh later wrote, &quot;raised as if from the dust to sit in the midst of princes. Events moved rapidly: the period was one of great crisis for the papacy. Adrian was enthroned on the 5th and crowned in St Peter&#x27;s on the 6th. His election, said Boso, &quot;happened—not without divine council—that they unanimously agreed&quot; on Adrian. To date, Adrian has been the only English pope. He was one of the few popes of his era who did not need consecrating on his election, as he was already a bishop.

According to Boso, Breakspear had to be forced &quot;against his will&quot; into the Papal throne. He took the name Adrian IV, possibly in honour of Adrian I, who revered St Alban and first granted the abbey of that name its privileges. It was, suggests Julius Norwich, &quot; wise choice, for energy and force were desperately needed&quot;. Although he had been elected unanimously from among the cardinals, the role of the Roman people was ignored. Thus relations between the Pope and his city were poor from the beginning, as were relations between Adrian and the King of Sicily, who controlled much of southern Italy. Relations with the commune were so bad that Adrian was forced to remain in the Leonine City and was thus unable to immediately complete the enthronement ceremony, as tradition dictated, by making his &quot;adventus&quot; into Rome itself. In the event, Adrian was required to remain there for the next four months. As a result, although he had been consecrated, he had not been crowned in the ceremony &quot;dies coronae&quot; at the Lateran which gave him not his title but gave him feudal title of the papal lands. It is probable that, due to problematic relations with the Romans, he did not receive his crown until the following Easter.

==Neutralises Rome==
Due to Arnold&#x27;s presence in Rome, there were a number of acts of religious significance that it was impossible to perform, such as the ceremony of the &quot;sede stercoraria&quot;, the physical claiming of the curule seats of Saints Peter and Paul. Soon after Adrian&#x27;s election, a cardinal was badly beaten up by Roman republicans. Adrian was no more popular with the people or Commune of Rome than his immediate predecessors, so at Easter the next year he departed for Viterbo. His &quot;primary task&quot;, argues Sayers, &quot;was to control the Emperor&quot; Frederick Barbarossa. Barbarossa had only recently been elected to the Imperial throne and for their own reasons, Pope and Emperor needed each other. Adrian needed Barbarossa&#x27;s military support against William, (known as &quot;The Bad&quot;) King of Sicily, who was threatening the Papal patrimony. For his part, the Emperor needed Adrian to perform the traditional imperial coronation service.

Adrian took a hardline against the Roman commune. He threatened to place the city under interdict for protecting Arnold, whom the hierarchy condemned as a heretic. This strategy successfully drove a wedge between the commune and Arnold, who was expelled. He followed through with this threat following the beating of one of his cardinals Norwich has called this &quot;an act of breath-taking courage&quot;, considering that Adrian was a foreign Pope of only a few weeks&#x27; tenure, who &quot;knew the city and its increasingly xenophobic inhabitants hardly at all and was able to rely on little or no popular support&quot;. on the Via Sacra. Rome was forced to submit to the Pope, and Arnold of Brescia was expelled. Although he had managed to restore Papal authority in the city, he was unable to eradicate the principle of republicanism, and the commune remained as the governing body.

===Neutralises Arnold===
Adrian angled for the support of the Emperor in capturing the heretic Arnold. Arnold was captured by Imperial troops in summer 1155. Arrested and tried in a Papal court for rebellion rather than heresy, he was hanged and his body burnt. Adrian claimed that Arnold&#x27;s execution had been on the initiative of the prefect of Rome, but some contemporary observers, such as Gerhoh of Reichersberg, suspected Adrian of ordering the execution himself. The Emperor&#x27;s willingness to assist the Pope in his own city, and help him crush his enemies, was an explicit recognition from Barbarossa of the Pope&#x27;s possession of Rome. Papal relations with the lords of Campania were already tense, as they, in the Pope&#x27;s view, were little more than robber barons, who both fought among each other and robbed pilgrims from the south on their way to Rome.

==Imperial trouble at Sutri, late 1155==

Barbarossa had received the Iron Crown of Lombardy—as King of Italy—in Pavia, but also wished to receive his Imperial Crown from the Pope. Adrian originally saw the Emperor as protector and defender of the church. Both parties, notes Ullmann, were unpopular in Rome:
To this end, Adrian and Barbarossa met at Sutri in early June 1155. This soon, says Sayers, &quot;turned out to be a spectacular contest between the two to gain propagandist supremacy&quot;. Adrian, reports an Imperial chronicler, was there &quot;with the entire Roman Church, met us joyfully, paternally offered us holy consecration and complained to us of the injuries he had suffered at the hands of the Roman populace&quot;. Barbarossa later recalled the ceremony in a letter to the Eastern Emperor in 1189:

Adrian may have been caught off-balance by the Emperor&#x27;s swift entry into Italy and the speed with which he approached Rome. The dispute was sparked by Barbarossa&#x27;s unwillingness to act as the Pope&#x27;s strator; lead the Pope&#x27;s horse by the bridle—or to assist Adrian in dismounting—as was traditionally expected. In response, the Pope refused the Emperor the kiss of peace; the Emperor was still willing to perform the duty of kissing Adrian&#x27;s feet, though. These were minor affronts at best, says Barber, &quot;but in an age so highly conscious of symbolic acts&quot;, took on a greater political import.

The confusion at Sutri may have been accidental, but Frederick also took offence at a mural in the Lateran of his predecessor Luthar which described the Emperor as a liegeman of the Pope. The painting was inscribed with the verse
Indignant, Barbarossa made a &quot;friendly reproach&quot; to the Pope. In a letter to a German bishop, he explained, &quot;it began with a picture. The picture became an inscription. The inscription seeks to become an authoritative utterance. We shall not endure it, we shall not submit to it.&quot; Adrian told Barbarossa he would have it removed, &quot;lest so trifling a matter might afford the greatest men in the world an occasion for dispute and discord. In the event, Adrian did not, and by 1158 Imperial commentators were describing the matter of the painting and its inscription as the fundamental cause of the dispute between Pope and Emperor. Adrian, says Freed, was &quot;perplexed&quot; at the Emperor&#x27;s refusal to offer him squire service: he &quot;dismounted and seated himself on a folding stool&quot;. Barbarossa, if he wished to be crowned, had limited options against the Pope. He took advice from councillors based on records of &quot;the more ancient princes and especially those who had come with King Lothar to Pope Innocent&quot;. An entire day was spent inspecting both &quot;old documents&quot;, and hearing from those of his entourage who had been present at the 1131 ceremony. The Pope&#x27;s party saw this as a sign of aggression, and deserted Adrian for the security of a nearby castle.

===Imperial coronation, 1155===
The Emperor was, though, eventually persuaded, performed the necessary services. He was eventually crowned in Nepi on 18 June. Peace was maintained at Nepi, however, and both Pope and Emperor dined together, wearing their crowns in a joint celebration of the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul. There was much rejoicing, and contemporaries went so far as to proclaim that &quot;a single state had been created from two princely courts&quot;. Ullmann, on the other hand, argues that, not only was the Emperor&#x27;s power clearly derivative of the Pope but that Adrian himself had further diluted it in his rendition of the coronation ceremony. Nor was there an official enthronement for the new emperor.

This ceremony, says Sayers, was arguably a new version of the traditional one, which now &quot;highlight[ed] the difference between the anointing of a mere layman and that of a priest&quot;. Previously, Emperors had been anointed on the head, as a priest was; this time, Adrian anointed Barbarossa between the shoulders. Further, the Pope invested him with a sword, which emphasised the Emperor&#x27;s role—as Adrian saw it—as the defender of the Papacy and its privileges. Adrian, on the other hand, disallowed his chancery from addressing the Emperor by either of his preferred titles, &quot;augustus semper&quot; or &quot;semper augustus&quot;. It may be that Adrian had been frightened by the Emperor&#x27;s decisive approach on Rome—Duggan notes he &quot;impos[ed] obedience on recalcitrant cities and proclaim[ed] the resumption of Imperial rights&quot; as he did. If so, that may have led him to over-reacting the face of a perceived slight, however small.

Following the Imperial coronation, both sides appear to have taken extra care to ensure they abided by the Treaty of Constance. Barbarossa, for example, refused to entertain an embassy from the Roman commune. He did not, however, further perform as Adrian hoped, and did not defend the Papacy. Indeed, he stayed in Rome only enough time to be crowned, and then left immediately: &quot;dubious protection&quot; for the Pope, comments Barber. Before he left, however, his army was drawn into a bloody clash with Rome&#x27;s citizens, incensed at what they saw as a display of Imperial authority in their city. Over 1,000 Romans died. The Senate continued revolting in Rome and William of Sicily remained entrenched in the Patrimony. Adrian was trapped between King and Emperor. Freed suggests that Barbarossa&#x27;s failure to suppress the Roman commune for Adrian led the Pope to believe the Emperor had broken the Treaty of Constance. Further, on the Emperor&#x27;s march north, his army sacked and razed the town of Spoleto. Adrian left Rome also, as his relations with the commune were still too fragile for him to be able to guarantee his safety following the Emperor&#x27;s departure. As a result, the Pope was left in &quot;virtual exile&quot; in Viterbo, and relations between the two declined further.

==Normans, Greeks and Apulians==

Probably as a result, he responded positively to overtures from the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I, and also the native barons of Southern Italy, who saw in Adrian&#x27;s support a chance for them to overthrow William, whom Adrian had recently excommunicated for invading the Papal patrimony. The rebellion had started off promisingly, with rebel victories at Bari, Trani and Andria. They had already found themselves a powerful ally in Manuel, the Byzantine Emperor, and welcomed anyone—including Adrian—who was hostile to William. Their leader, Count Robert of Loritello, had been charged with treason by William but had managed to escape north. William was temporarily struck down with an unknown illness, as the scholar Joshua C. Birk explains, &quot;this brought the enemies of the kingdom of Sicily out of the woodwork&quot;; among them, Adrian excommunicated William. By 1154, William had captured important towns in the Patrimony. In summer 1155 rebellion broke out in southern Italy by the native nobility against their lord, the King of Sicily. One group of rebels, having gained the support of Emperor Manuel, overran Ancona. By winter 1155, suggests Norwich, few contemporaries &quot;would have held out much hope for the future of the Sicilian monarchy&quot;. According to Boso, the rebels asked Adrian to come to them as their feudal lord, to act as their spiritual advisor and bless them in their endeavours. Adrian, believing that William&#x27;s kingdom would collapse imminently, tried to exploit William&#x27;s weakness and allied with the rebels in September. As it turned out, this was a miscalculation. William had already asked Adrian for a peace conference, which the Pope had (&quot;scornfully&quot;) rejected.

===Alliance with Manuel I, 1156===
Emperor Manuel I had launched his own military operation against William in southern Italy in 1154. He found Adrian a willing ally. The Russian historian Alexander Vasiliev notes that Adrian &quot;expressed his desire &#x27;to help in bringing all the brethren into one church&#x27; and compared the eastern church with lost &quot;drachma&quot;, wandering sheep, and the dead Lazarus&quot;. Adrian&#x27;s isolation led directly to his concordat with the Eastern Empire in 1156, although Duggan emphasises that he was reacting to external political pressures rather than deliberately initiating a new policy. As a result, says Barber, he &quot;became involved in a fruitless Byzantine plan to overcome the Normans which ended, as so often before when the popes had ventured south in arms, in Norman victory&quot;. Adrian—as if, says Partner, &quot;the unhappy experiences of at least three popes has taught the papacy nothing&quot;—organised a papal army comprising Roman and Campagnan nobility and crossed the border into Apulia in September 1155.

Although it has been suggested that Manuel offered to pay Adrian a large sum of money in return for ceding him certain Apulian cities, it seems unlikely that this was ever actioned; certainly, notes Duggan, Adrian was wholly against the creation of a Byzantine kingdom on his own doorstep. This was in spite of Manuel deliberately not pressing his ancestor&#x27;s historical claim to south Italy as a whole, and was interested primarily in the coastal areas. Initially, his campaign succeeded, and by 1155 he had occupied the area from Ancona to Taranto. Byzantine funding enabled Adrian to temporarily restore his vassal Robert, Count of Loritello, although on one occasion William was able to capture of gold from Manuel that had been destined for the Pope&#x27;s war chest. There was some discussion of an alliance between Roman Pope and Eastern Emperor, and Adrian despatched Anselm of Havelberg east to arrange it, although in the event negotiations came to nothing. Magdalino argues that Adrian would not have been interested in an alliance &quot;without the lure of Byzantine gold&quot;. Although the Byzantine Emperor had sent his army to support the Pope in Italy—and indeed, had subdued the troublesome region of the Balkans—Adrian, argues Sayers, &quot;could not accept any power for the emperor that was not dependent on the pope&quot;. Ullmann argues that although Adrian was receptive to Manuel&#x27;s ambition of uniting the Eastern and Western Roman Empires, he did not appreciate the manner in which the offer was made. He was particularly averse to Manuel&#x27;s suggestion that the pope&#x27;s sword was merely a spiritual force, and, suggests Ullmann, &quot;received Manuel&#x27;s overtures with that scepticism which they deserved&quot;. Adrian, though, while agreeing on the basic tenet of a single emperor and a single church, believed that it was not a case of the Western church joining that of the East, but the latter returning to the former with the &quot;obedience due to a mother&quot;, as he put it in a letter to Manuel. In other words, all Christians, East or West, should be subjugated to the church of St Peter.

===Norman victory===
Strategically, King William&#x27;s position was not looking good, and he offered Adrian large sums in financial compensation for the Pope to withdraw his forces. However, the majority of Adrian&#x27;s curia were averse to holding negotiations with the Sicilians, and the King&#x27;s offer was rejected somewhat haughtily. This turned out to be a bad mistake. William soon won decisive victories over both Greek and Apulian armies in mid-1156, culminating in the final defeat of the Eastern Empire at the Battle of Brindisi. When William soundly defeated the rebels, Adrian—who was by now, even more, bogged down in the problem of Rome and without allies—had to sue for peace on the King&#x27;s terms. This was yet another external event—indeed, probably the single most important event of the pontificate she argues—that Adrian had had no way of influencing but had to deal with its consequences, notes Duggan. He was effectively captured and forced to come to terms at Benevento three weeks later. This one event, says Duggan, changed Adrian&#x27;s policy for good, whether or not he liked it. As a result, at the Concordat of Benevento, Adrian had to invest William with the lands he claimed in southern Italy, symbolised by the presentation of the Pope&#x27;s own pennoned lances and the kiss of peace. The Pope was accepted as William&#x27;s feudal overlord, while being forbidden from entering Sicily without an invitation from the King, thereby granting William effectively Legatine authority over the church in his own land. For his part, William gave the Pope his homage and contracted to pay an annual tribute and provide military support on request. The treaty conferred extended powers on the Kings of Sicily that they would enjoy for at least the next 40 years, and included powers over ecclesiastical appointments traditionally held by the Popes as the region&#x27;s feudal lord. Adrian&#x27;s treaty with William angered the Emperor, who took it as a personal slight that Adrian had treated with the two Imperial rivals to Italy and confirmed his view of Adrian&#x27;s Papal arrogance. This, suggests Robinson, sowed the seeds of the disputed election following Adrian&#x27;s death.

The defeat of Manuel&#x27;s army left the Pope vulnerable, and in June 1156 Adrian was forced to come to terms with the Sicilian King. This was, however, suggests Robinson, on generous terms, including &quot;homage and fealty, reparation for the recent encroachments on the papal patrimony, help against the Romans, freedom from royal control for the Sicilian church&quot;. Adrian&#x27;s new alliance with William exacerbated relations with Barbarossa, who believed that Adrian had broken the Treaty of Constance twice over, by allying with both King William and the Byzantine Emperor. Relations between Pope and Emperor were, argues Latowsky, &quot;irreparably damaged. Adrian probably acted as mediator the following year in concluding a peace treaty between William and Manuel. The Emperor attempted to prevent the treaty by sending his most experienced diplomat, Abbot Wibald to intervene, as he probably saw a Sicilian–Byzantine alliance as being directed against him.

The alliance with William had probably been strengthened by the Pope&#x27;s belief that Barbarossa had already broken the Treaty of Constance. At the Treaty of Benevento, Adrian was represented by the Cardinals Ubald, Julius and Roland; the Papacy was forced to cede much valuable land, rights and income to William. The Emperor felt personally betrayed: according to the contemporary chronicler Geoffrey of Viterbo, the Pope, &quot;wish[ed] to be an enemy of Caesar&quot;. Duggan, however, suggests that the Imperial alliance with the papacy had only ever been a flag of convenience, &quot;ready to be discarded when it had served its purpose&quot;. Bolton, meanwhile, suggests that, as Benevento was an Imperial town, the fact that following the treaty he stayed there for eight more months indicates that Adrian was asserting his power.

==Problems in translation, 1157==
By 1157, suggests Whalen, having secured the border with the south (by his alliance with Sicily) and the commune as peaceful as it had been for some time, Adrian was able to reside in Rome again and &quot;stood in a more secure position than any of his predecessors had for decades&quot;. They were made worse in 1157 when, in a letter to the Emperor, Adrian referred to the Empire by the Latin term &quot;beneficium&quot;, which some of Barbarossa&#x27;s councillors translated as fief, rather than benefice. This, they claimed, implied that the Pope saw the Empire as subordinate to the Papacy. The Emperor had to personally hold back Otto of Wittelsbach from assaulting the Pope&#x27;s messengers. Ullmann, however, argues that Adrian&#x27;s use of the word was &quot;harmless enough...that he conferred the Imperial crown as a favour&quot;. Duggan too describes the incident as &quot;at best a diplomatic incident—a &quot;faux pas&quot;—which suggests carelessness on the part of the drafter&quot;. Historians have disagreed as to the degree of deliberation behind the use of the word. Peter Munz, for example, believes it to have been a deliberate provocation, engineered by an anti-Imperial faction within the curia, designed to justify Adrian&#x27;s treaty with King William. Anne Duggan, on the other hand, suggests this view is &quot;scarcely credible&quot;: not only was Adrian in no position of strength from which to threaten Frederick, but he was also aware that the Emperor was planning a campaign against Milan for the following year, and would hardly wish to provoke him into marching on towards the Papal States.

In October 1157, Barbarossa was celebrating his wedding in Besançon with an Imperial Diet, when he was visited by Papal legates Roland and Bernard. Theirs was an important mission bringing personal letters from Adrian, and they were met &quot;with honour and kindness, claiming (as they did) to be the bearers of good tidings&quot;. The Pope complained about the lack of activity in discovering who attacked Eskil, Archbishop of Lund while he travelled through Imperial territory. Eskil, complained Adrian, had been captured somewhere &quot;in the German lands...by certain godless and infamous men&quot;, and Frederick had made no attempt to secure his release. Adrian&#x27;s letter, suggests Godman, both upbraids the Emperor for &quot;dissimulation&quot; and &quot;negligence&quot; while accusing Rainald of Dassel of being a &quot;wicked counsellor &quot;, although Duggan describes it more as a &quot;mild rebuke&quot;. Barber comments that &quot;the tone is that of one who is surprised and a little hurt that, having treated Frederick so affectionately and honourably, he had not had a better response, but the actual words used to express these sentiments gave rise to immediate offence&quot;. Adrian&#x27;s defence of Eskil of Lund contributed further to the decline in his relationship with Barbarossa. Adrian&#x27;s choice of occasion on which to rebuke the Emperor was bound to offend him, argues Norwich. But even if unintentional, argues Freed, the Pope should have instructed his delegates to meet with Barbarossa privately rather than in the open. Equally provocative, Freed suggests, was Adrian&#x27;s later assertion that letters which criticised the Emperor&#x27;s behaviour were somehow to his advantage. Adrian&#x27;s &quot;sharp&quot; words also contributed to the Emperor&#x27;s advisors increasing discontent with his messengers. The Pope had also ordered that, before any negotiations took place, the Emperor&#x27;s council would accept Adrian&#x27;s letters &quot;without any hesitation...as though proceeding from our mouth&quot;. The cardinals appear to have worsened their reception by calling Frederick &quot;brother&quot;.

The Emperor was also exasperated to find, on ordering the legates&#x27; quarters searched, blank parchments with the Papal seal attached. This he understood to mean that the legates had intended to present supposedly direct instructions from the Pope when they felt it necessary. Barbarossa claimed that he held his crowns directly from God and that Adrian &quot;did not understand his Petrine commission if he thought otherwise&quot;. Following promulgation of Adrian&#x27; letter, says Godman, &quot;there was uproar&quot;. Worse, says Barbarossa&#x27;s contemporary chronicler Otto of Freising, the legates compounded the insult by asking those present &quot;from whom the does he have the empire, if not from our lord the pope?&quot; The two ecclesiasts were then nearly beaten up, but the Emperor enabled their swift escape.

=== Retranslation ===
In June 1158, representatives of both sides met in the Imperial town of Augsburg. Adrian attempted to pacify the Emperor and claimed that he meant, not &quot;fief&quot;, but &quot;good deed&quot;: &quot;Among us &quot;beneficium&quot; means not a fief but a good deed&quot;, he wrote. Barber suggests, though, that &quot;his explanation was far from convincing&quot;. On the other hand, notes the Emperor&#x27;s biographer John Freed, Barbarossa was illiterate, and required everything translated. He was thus in constant danger of relying on mistranslations, and it is possible that this happened at Besançon. Taken at face value, this phrase appeared to assert that Adrian was the Emperor&#x27;s feudal overlord.
Latowsky argues that the mistranslation was a deliberate ploy by Barbarossa&#x27;s Archchancellor Rainald of Dassel—whom she describes as a &quot;multilingual provocateur&quot;—whose Chancery was waging a propaganda war against Adrian. The Pope had earlier condemned Reinauld&#x27;s election as Archbishop of Cologne believed Rainauld to be nothing less than the Devil&#x27;s agent.
Latowsky suggests that Rainauld had intended to cause trouble between Emperor and Pope. If this was the case, he succeeded, as Barbarossa was only just restrained from sending an army against Adrian. The Emperor did make a public declaration against Adrian, though, calling for his deposition on the grounds that, as the son of a priest, he was an uncanonical pope. Ullmann notes that canonicity &quot;was indubitably a double-edged weapon; if Adrian was an uncanonical pope, then Frederick was an uncanonical emperor, and that seems the only reason why this point was not pressed further&quot;. Duggan summarises Adrian&#x27;s Augsburg letter as being concomitant to one&#x27;s interpretation of the original offence, noting that &quot;the context...determines everything&quot;. While Munz views the Augsburg outcome as a &quot;humiliating&quot; retreat by Adrian, Duggan argues that, if one does not view the Besançon letter as deliberately provocative, &quot;then there was no withdrawal from that provocation&quot;.

Adrian&#x27;s choice of words may also have been a &quot;calculated ambiguity&quot;, suggests Abulafia, and in the event, Adrian never publicly acknowledged which of the interpretations he had actually intended. This would have allowed him to suggest the Emperor has misunderstood him while allowing the Pope to intimate to his own church that the Emperor was indeed a Papal vassal. Adrian &quot;trivialised&quot; Barbarossa&#x27;s anger with irony, commenting that &quot;this should not have vexed the heart of even one in lowly station, to say nothing of so great a man&quot;. The Augsburg meeting seems to have improved relations between Pope and Emperor. As Freed notes, though, &quot;the fundamental question...remained unresolved&quot;, and any improvement in relations was temporary, as they fell out again later that year over the appointment of the next Archbishop of Ravenna. This revived the question of their respective roles, as the nominations were split between each sides&#x27; preferences; in the event, the Imperial candidate—Guido of Biandrate—was elected against Adrian&#x27;s wishes. There was also increasing disagreement over the traditional &quot;fodrum&quot; Imperial taxation levied in north Italy.

== Imperial claims to north Italy ==
Adrian&#x27;s opposition to Guido of Biandrate&#x27;s appointment had so incensed the Emperor that he no longer placed the Pope&#x27;s name before his own in their correspondence, as had been a traditional sign of honour. Furthermore, he began aggressively asserting his claims over Lombardy, and in 1159 the Diet of Roncaglia issued a series of decrees claiming extensive lands in north Italy. This caused sufficient concern that the cities of Milan—which Barbarossa had already &quot;half-destroyed&quot;, says Ullmann—Brescia, Piacenza and Crema (which had also suffered a &quot;brutal siege&quot;, notes Duggan) approached Adrian for aid. Since the lands concerned were part of the Papal fiefdom, Adrian, in Bologna, rejected Barbarossa&#x27;s claim and gave him 40 days in which to withdraw them, on pain of excommunication. However, Adrian&#x27;s intervention in a quarrel between the Emperor and the Lombard towns may, suggests the classicist Peter Partner, &quot;may have been inevitable, but it was to be one of the most explosive issues of its age&quot;.

Duggan has emphasised the severity of the situation facing Adrian: accepting Frederick&#x27;s claims, she says, would have entailed Adrian effectively &quot;abandoning the whole Italian church&quot;. Adrian also had counter-demands. Frederick was to desist from sending envoys to Rome without papal permission, that he should only be paid the Imperial tax from his Italian lands while in Italy and that those papal lands in north Italy be returned to the church. Adrian, says Duggan, &quot;received short thrift&quot;. In the event Adrian died before his 40-day term expired. As relations between Emperor and Pope worsened, Barbarossa took to placing his own name before that of Adrian in their correspondence, as well as addressing the Pope in the singular. By now, suggests Duggan, Adrian was viewed with contempt by the Emperor.

==Relations with England==
Pope Adrian, comments Sayers, &quot;was not unmindful of the interests and well-being of his English homeland&quot;, and Robinson identifies his pontificate as &quot;the period in which
English influence was strongest in the papal curia&quot;. Adrian remained faithful to the cult of St Alban and often promoted King Henry&#x27;s political ambitions when he could. For example, suggests Brooke, following his lengthy stay with Adrian, John of Salisbury seems to have acquired the belief that he would at some point receive a cardinalate. However, John fell out with King Henry for a now-unknown reason, and Adrian—probably wishing to promote his friend but essentially a diplomat and a realist—could not afford to alienate his only major supporter in northern Europe. Adrian also favourably received at least two curial embassies from St Albans in 1156 and 1157. In 1156 Adrian ordered King Henry II to appoint an otherwise unknown Hugh to a London prebend. He wrote to Roger, Archbishop of York two months after Adrian&#x27;s election confirming the Papal Legates in their offices.

Adrian had been absent from England since 1120, and it should not be assumed that he bore an automatic affection for the country which, in Richard Southern&#x27;s words, had given him &quot;no reasons to cherish warm feelings&quot; about it. However, in 1156, when John of Salisbury—&quot;in circumstances which otherwise remain obscure&quot;—had fallen into disgrace with the English King, Adrian regularly petitioned Henry for his friend&#x27;s reinstatement. This was eventually won, but had taken a year to achieve. Anne Duggan, of King&#x27;s College, London, describes Anglo-Papal relations at this time as &quot;not so much to a policy, perhaps, but to persistent intervention...and to a degree of acceptance, willing or not, on the part of Church authorities&quot;. However, Adrian was willing to intervene in English church affairs when it suited, as in February 1156 when he threatened Nigel, Bishop of Ely with suspension from office over what the art historian C. R. Dodwell has called Nigel&#x27;s having &quot;stripped-down, sold, or used as security, a quite astounding number of Ely&#x27;s monastic treasures&quot;.

Among other patronages, he confirmed the nuns of St Mary&#x27;s Priory, Neasham in possession of their church. and granted St Albans Abbey &quot;a large dossier of privileges and directives&quot; exempting it from the jurisdiction of its episcopal master, Robert de Chesney, Bishop of Lincoln. He also confirmed the primacy of the Archbishop of York over Scottish bishops and his independence from the Archbishop of Canterbury. He also granted papal protection—&quot;free and immune from all subjection except to the Roman pontiff&quot;—to Scottish towns, such as that of Kelso in 1155. He also, on occasion, sent his young protégés to the court of King Henry to learn the aristocratic arts of hunting, falconry and the martial arts.

Adrian, suggests the papal scholar Brenda M. Bolton, had a particularly &quot;special relationship&quot; with his &quot;home abbey&quot; of St Albans, demonstrated in his generous and wide-ranging privilege &quot;Incomprehensibilis&quot;, published in Benevento on 5 February 1156.{{refn|The title of the grant came, as was traditional with Papal documents, from the opening words. In this case, the first sentence is{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=93}}{{sfn|Bolton|Duggan|2003|p=313}}
{{!}}-
{{!}} &quot;Incomprehensibilis et ineffabilis diuine miseratio maiestatis nos hac providentie ratione in apostolice sedis administratione constituit...&quot;
{{!}} The incomprehensible and ineffable mercy of the Divine Majesty has established us in the apostolic see for this providential reason...
|group=note}} With this grant, Adrian allowed the abbot the right to wear pontificals, thereby effectively removing the abbot from the jurisdiction of Robert de Chesney, his bishop. The monks were also allowed to elect the abbot of their choosing without deference to the bishop. Neither could they be forced by him to allow him or his agents entry to the abbey, or to attend episcopal synods. In two follow up letters, Adrian gave the Abbot of St Albans authority to replace the clerks in churches under his jurisdiction with his preferred candidates.{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=93}} Brooke describes Adrian as &quot;rain[ing] privilege after privilege upon the abbey.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=5}}

===&quot;Laudabiliter&quot;===

Probably Adrian&#x27;s &quot;most striking&quot;{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=355}} donation to England, however, was the Papal Bull &quot;Laudabiliter&quot; of 1155.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=355}} This was supposedly made either while Adrian was in Benevento or had moved on to Florento.{{sfn|Poole|1969|p=267}} John of Salisbury later claimed credit, writing how &quot;at my request [Adrian] conceded and gave Ireland as a hereditary possession to the illustrious king of the English, Henry II&quot;.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=355}} This granted the island of Ireland to Henry II in fee simple. Adrian&#x27;s justification was that, since the Donation of Constantine, countries within Christendom were the Pope&#x27;s to distribute as he would.{{refn|This was the same basis for the Papacy&#x27;s claim to precedence over the Holy Roman Empire, as the inheritor of the ancient Roman Empire in the West.{{sfn|Barber|1992|p=102}} &quot;Laudabiliter&quot; was, however, the only time in the 12th century that the Donation was interpreted as allowing interference in foreign countries.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|pp=355–356}}|group=note}} The claim of &quot;Vicarius Christi&quot; which Adrian inherited allowed him, he believed, to wield the temporal power of his subjects through them.{{sfn|Sheehy|1961|p=48}} Sayers suggests that &quot;while some kind of Irish mission&quot; was clearly intended by Adrian, the precise nature of the grant remains unclear.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}{{refn|This is compounded by the fact that no copy of &quot;Laudabiliter&quot; is extant.{{sfn|Norgate|1893|p=20}}|group=note}} Duggan, also notes that neither Henry or Adrian ever seems to have referred to it in their own letters again: &quot;whatever Adrian granted, and he did grant something, there is no reliable evidence&quot; as to its nature or what it comprised.{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=139}}

King Henry claimed to be motivated by a wish to civilise the supposedly unruly Irish.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} The Victorian historian Kate Norgate, however, has noted that the spiritual community in 12th-century Ireland &quot;flourished&quot;, and that the Pope must have known this, as it was only a few years earlier that the Irish church had been reorganised into Archdioceses,{{sfn|Norgate|1893|pp=37–39}} thus making it a national church in its own right.{{sfn|Richter|1974|p=197}} Norgate argues that Adrian&#x27;s grant was made, not because the church in Ireland needed protecting, but because the Irish lacked a single king and for Christian society to have no single head was an anathema.{{sfn|Norgate|1893|pp=39–40}} She also notes that it has misleadingly been called a Bull, when it is, in fact, sufficiently informal in its style to be &quot;nothing more than a commendatory letter&quot;.{{sfn|Norgate|1893|p=40}} Simple in its approach, the Pope exhorts Henry—if he is to invade Ireland—to do so in the name of the church.{{sfn|Sheehy|1961|p=63}} Other scholars have argued that, whether or not it was an out and out forgery by Gerald of Wales, Adrian was more likely to have been lukewarm at the idea of invasion at best, as he was equally unenthusiastic at the notion of a Franco-English crusade to the East at the same time.{{sfn|Kostick|2013}}

The Bull &quot;granted and gave Ireland to King Henry II to hold by hereditary right, as his letters witness unto this day&quot;, and was accompanied by a gold Papal ring &quot;as a token of investiture&quot;.{{sfn|Norgate|1893|p=20}} In the early 14th century it was claimed (&quot;by the ordinary [i.e. English] people of Ireland&quot;) that Pope had been persuaded{{sfn|Frame|1989|p=153}}—&quot;improperly&quot;{{sfn|Broun|2007|p=37}}—to grant &quot;Laudabiliter&quot;, not on the persuasion of Henry II, but on that from the Irish themselves.{{sfn|Frame|1989|p=153}}{{refn|Specifically, says the early medievalist Robin Frame, that of MacMurrough, King of Leinster, who, having been expelled from his lands, asked Henry for aid, who then &quot;informed Pope Adrian of MacMurrough&#x27;s suggestion and asked for permission to enter that land&quot;.{{sfn|Frame|1989|p=153}}|group=note}} If he did issue the bull, Adrian may have been influenced by the fact that the Irish church did not pay Peter&#x27;s Pence, which was a major source of the Papacy&#x27;s income. He would almost certainly, too, have been aware of Bernard of Clairvaux&#x27;s letter of 1149, in which he wrote that{{sfn|Hegarty|2011|p=60}}

{{blockquote|text=Never before had he known the like, in whatever depth of barbarism; never had he found men so shameless in regard of morals, so dead in regard to rites, so stubborn in regard of discipline, so unclean in regard of life.

Notes Summerson, &quot;the consequences of the bull were still invisible when Adrian died&quot;.{{sfn|Summerson|2004}} As early as 1317, Adrian&#x27;s grant to Henry was linked in Ireland to his nationality,{{sfn|Richter|1974|p=195}}{{refn|Nationality has been impossible to avoid in the subsequent historiography, comments the medievalist J.

==Acts as pope==

In 1155 the city state of Genoa approached Adrian and sought him to help them defend their trading rights in the East.{{sfn|Balard|2007|p=41}}{{refn|Whilst at the same time making overtures to the Manuel I to formalise a trading treaty with Genoa.{{sfn|Balard|2007|p=41}}|group=note}} The same year Adrian issued the decretal &quot;Dignum est&quot; which allowed serfs to marry without having to obtain their lord&#x27;s permission as had traditionally been the case. Adrian&#x27;s reasoning was that a sacrament outweighed a feudal due and that no Christian had the right to stand in the way of another&#x27;s receiving of a sacrament. This was to become the definitive statement of marriage as a sacrament,{{sfn|Reynolds|2016|pp=40, 451}} and remained such until the recodification of Canon Law in 1917.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=190}} The same year, Adrian consecrated the Bishop of Grado, Enrico Dandolo as Primate of Dalmatia.{{sfn|Madden|2007|p=36}} Two years later, Adrian granted him primacy over all the Venetian churches in the Eastern Empire.{{sfn|Madden|2018|p=63}} This has been described as &quot;a remarkable move&quot;: The historian Thomas F. Madden notes that not only was this the first occasion on which one metropolitan had been given jurisdiction over another, but in doing so Adrian had created the equivalent of an Eastern Patriarch in the west.{{sfn|Madden|2012|p=80}} He also confirmed the degradation of Baume Abbey imposed by Eugenius for its failure to obey a Papal legate.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=325 n.48}}

Adrian confirmed the prerogatives of the Knights Templar and documented in the &quot;Liber Censuum&quot;.{{sfn|Bellomo|2008|p=268}} He also enforced the rules against unfree ecclesiastical elections and condemned ecclesiastics who used physical force against the church.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=191}} Perhaps reflecting his earlier career, he also promulgated several bulls in favour of the Austin canons. Again, he particularly focussed on houses of his personal association; St Ruf, for example, received at least 10 bulls of privilege. In one of these, he expressed a &quot;special bond of affection&quot; for his old abbey, which he said had been like a mother to him.{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=27}}

Adrian argued that, in the troubled succession to Alfonso I of Aragon, even though Alfonso had legally nominated an heir—his brother—because he had not had a son, his brother was not a direct heir to the Kingdom.{{sfn|Martindale|1989|p=27}} This was the context for the projected crusade into Spain as suggested by the Kings of England and France, which Adrian rejected. He did, however, welcome their new friendship.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=39}}

It was probably Adrian who canonised Sigfrid of Sweden around 1158, thus making Sigfrid Sweden&#x27;s apostle.{{sfn|Beck|1940|p=384}} Robinson notes that Adrian&#x27;s fascination with Scandinavia continued into his pontificate, particularly in his efforts to create a Swedish metropolis. He was also keen to defend its church against lay encroachment.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}} In January 1157 Archbishop Eskil{{refn|Eskil was a personal friend of Bernard of Clairvaux and had been responsible for originally introducing monasticism to Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=350}}|group=note}} personally presented a petition to Adrian in Rome, requesting protection from King Swein of Denmark.{{refn|Swein was also a vassal of the Holy Roman Emperor.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=350}}|group=note}} Adrian both appointed the Bishop of Lund his Legate in the region{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=350}} and recognised him as primate over both Sweden and Denmark.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=203}}{{refn|Eventually the three provinces agreed on Uppsala as the centre of the proposed metropolitan, and Alexander III conferred it in 1164.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=349}}|group=note}}

Other cardinalate appointments of Adrian&#x27;s included that of Alberto di Morra in 1156. Di Mora, also a canon regular like Adrian, later reigned briefly as Pope Gregory VIII in 1187. Boso, already papal chamberlain since 1154, was appointed the same year. Adrian also elevated one Walter to the Pope&#x27;s own Cardinal Bishopric of Albano; Walter is thought to have been an Englishman—possible also from St Ruf—but very little record of his career has survived. In contrast, his appointment of Raymond des Arénes in 1158 was of a well-known lawyer with an established career under Adrian&#x27;s predecessors.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|pp=182–183}} These were all worthy additions to the Curial office, argues Duggan, being all men of &quot;experience, academic learning and administrative and diplomatic skill&quot;, which in turn reflects the wisdom of the appointer.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=183}} He may have received the hermit and later saint Silvester of Troina, whose only recorded journey was from Sicily to Rome during Adrian&#x27;s pontificate.{{sfn|Oldfield|2014|p=131}}

Adrian continued the reform of the Papacy&#x27;s finances that had begun under his predecessor in an attempt at boosting revenue,{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=238}}{{refn|This process involved Boso, as Chamberlain examining old rent books from the archives in the hope of discovering lost Papal dues,{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=238}} and Adrian also ordered the keeping of more precise fiscal records,{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=125}} which became the nucleus of the &quot;Liber Censuum&quot;.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=182}}|group=note}} although he regularly had to resort to requesting large loans from major noble families such as the Corsi and Frangipane.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|pp=164, 165 n.170}}{{refn|For example, a loan from Pietro Frangipane in 1158 of 1,000 marks, for which a number of Papal castles had been given as security, was not paid off until 1190.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=228}}|group=note}} His appointment of Boso as Chamberlain—or camerarius—of the Papal patrimony did much to improve the Papacy&#x27;s finances by way of streamlining its financial bureaucracy.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2004|p=23}} However, he also recognised the expense that the Papay was put to defending its own, commenting &quot;nemo potest sine stipendiis militare&quot;, or &quot;no-one can make war without pay&quot;.{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=214}} Adrian also consolidated the Papacy&#x27;s position as the feudal lord of the regional baronage;{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=54}} indeed, his success in doing so has been described as &quot;never less than impressive&quot;.{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=178}} In 1157, for example, Adrian made Oddone Frangipane donate his castle to him, which Adrian then granted back to Oddone in fee.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=54}}{{refn|Wickhma argues this was Papal policy: &quot;aristocrats in Rome had to resign themselves to having possession of their lands, not full property&quot;.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=54}}|group=note}} occasionally Adrian simply purchased castles and lordships for the papacy, as he did Corchiano.{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=194}} Adrian received the personal oaths of fealty of a number of north-Roman nobles, thus making them vassals of St Peter.{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=125}} In 1158, for example, for fighting in the &quot;Reconquista&quot;—&quot;subduing the barbarous peoples and the savage nations, that is, the fury of the Saracens&quot;—Ramon Berenguer, Count of Barcelona was accepted &quot;under St Peter&#x27;s and our protection&quot;.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=348}} In 1159 Adrian ratified an agreement with the civic leadership of Ostia—an otherwise semi-independent town—agreed to pay the Pope an annual feudal rent for his lordship.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=106}} Adrian&#x27;s vassals, and their family and vassals, took oaths of fealty to the Pope, and in doing so the vassal absolved his own vassals of their oaths to him. All now became direct vassals of the Papacy.{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|pp=178–179}} One of Adrian&#x27;s greatest achievements, believed Boso, was acquiring Orvieto as a Papal fief, because this city had &quot;for a very long time withdrawn itself from the jurisdiction of St Peter&quot;{{sfn|Bolton|Duggan|2003|pp=230–231}}{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=194}} Adrian, in 1156, was the first Pope to enter Orvieto, emphasised Boso, and to &quot;have any temporal power there&quot;.{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=194}}

Adrian appears to have been an advocate of the crusade since his abbacy of St Ruf,{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=32}} and was equally keen to rekindle the crusading spirit among Christian rulers as Pope. The most recent crusade had ended, poorly, in 1150, but Adrian made what has been called a &quot;novel approach&quot; to launching a new one. In 1157 he announced that, whereas previously indulgences were available to those who fought in the East, from now on they would be also available to those who supported the war effort without necessarily campaigning abroad. This opened the benefits of crusading up to those who supplied money, men or materiel. However, his proposal, novel or otherwise, appears to have met with little interest, and no further crusading was to take place until 1189.{{sfn|Freed|2016|pp=472–473}}{{sfn|Tyerman|1998|pp=14–15}} He did not, however, approve of Crusading within Christendom itself, as when the French and English kings both proposed a crusade into Muslim Spain, he urged caution upon them. In his January 1159{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=39}} letter &quot;Satis laudabiliter&quot;, while flattering both kings diplomatically, he advised that &quot;it would seem to be neither wise nor safe to enter a foreign land without first seeking the advice of the princes and people of the area&quot;.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=191}} Indeed, Adrian reminded Henry and Louis of the consequences of badly planned and mismanaged crusades by reference to the Second Crusade—of which Louis had been a leader—reminding him that, there too, Louis had invaded &quot;without consulting the people of the area&quot;.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=192}}{{refn|He did however defer rather than deny the request for a crusade, as he intimated that, if his conditions were met—i.e. that western princes were invited to do so—he would then countenance their crusade.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=192}}|group=note}}

Adrian also undertook a building program throughout Rome and the patrimony, although Duggan notes that the shortness of his pontificate reduced the amount of his work that remains visible in the 21st century. The work ranged from the restoration of public buildings and spaces to the city&#x27;s physical defence.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=201}} Boso reported how, for example, &quot;in the church of St Peter [Adrian] richly restored the roof of St. Processo which he found collapsed&quot;, while in the Lateran, he &quot;caused to be made a very necessary and extremely large cistern&quot;.{{sfn|Bolton|Duggan|2003|pp=230–231}} Due to the peripatetic nature of his pontificate he also built a large number of summer palaces across the patrimony, including at Segni, Ferentino, Alatri, Anagni and Rieti.{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=166}} Much of this fortification and building work—particularly in the vicinity of Rome—was for the protection of pilgrims, the safety of whom Adrian was both spiritually and physically reliable for.{{sfn|Partner|1972|pp=193–194}}

Although his pontificate was a relatively short one—four years, six months and 28 days—he spent nearly half that time outside of Rome, either in the enclave of Benevento or journeying around the Papal States and patrimony. Particularly in the early years of the reign, his travels reflected the political context, consisting of &quot;short bursts&quot; as he sought to either meet or avoid the Emperor or William of Sicily as the situation required.{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=164}}

==Personal philosophy and religious views==

The Pope was conscious, comments Sayers, &quot;of the crushing responsibilities&quot; of his office,{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} telling John of Salisbury that he felt his Papal tiara to be &quot;splendid because it burned with fire&quot;.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} He was also highly conscious of the historicity of the Petrine tradition; as much as any of his predecessors, says Duggan, Adrian upheld the &quot;unifying and an co-ordinating role of the Papal office&quot;, and regularly expressed himself on how he viewed his position as that akin to being a steward:{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=196}} He also recognised his own smallness within that tradition, telling John of Salisbury that &quot;the Lord has long since placed me between the hammer and the anvil, and now he must support the burden he has placed upon me, for I cannot carry it&quot;.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=197}} This explains his use of the epithet &quot;Servus servorum Dei&quot;, comments Duggan: more than purely rhetorical, it amalgamated his concept of &quot;stewardship, duty and usefulness&quot; in three words.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=197}}

{{blockquote|text=Having been placed by the Lord&#x27;s disposition in a lofty watchtower, if the rights of all churches are not preserved whole and unimpaired, we would seem to occupy the place of St Peter Prince of the Apostles unprofitably and to exercise the office of stewardship entrusted to us negligently.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=196}}}}
Adrian was keen to emphasise the superiority of the Western Church over that of the East, and lost no opportunity to tell members of that body so.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} 
Adrian described his approach to relations with his political rivals in a letter to the Archbishop of Thessaloniki. St Peter&#x27;s authority was indivisible and could not be shared with temporal rulers, he argued. As such—as the descendant of St Peter—neither should he.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Central to Adrian&#x27;s view of his Papacy, says Sayers, was the conviction that his court was the highest court in Christendom and, so, the final court of appeal, and he encouraged appeals from many countries.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} In an early letter, defending the principle of Papal Monarchy, he compares Christendom to the human body: all the parts can only function as they should if they have an overarching guide and facilitator. To Adrian, Christian Europe was the body, and the Pope the head.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=236}} The historian Neil Hegarty has suggested that, on the assumption that &quot;Laudabiliter&quot; as is extant can be believed, Adrian firmly believed in &quot;enlarging the borders of the Church, setting bounds to the progress of wickedness, reforming evil manners, planting virtue, and increasing the Christian religion&quot;.{{sfn|Hegarty|2011|p=60}} Adrian was keen to know what people thought of the Roman Church, and often asked the question of John of Salisbury.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} John also recorded Adrian&#x27;s view&#x27;s on the Papacy accepting gifts from Christians, which some viewed as simonaical and evidence of corruption. Adrian, reported John, replied with reference to the fable of the belly. The European analyst Andreas Musolff explains the Pope&#x27;s position as &quot;deducing from it the church&#x27;s right to receive, and allocate, the nourishment to the Christian body according to merit and utility&quot;.{{sfn|Musolff|2004|p=59}}

Adrian, argues Ullmann, was a man of action with little &quot;inclination towards lengthy theoretical discussions&quot;,{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=234}} although Norwich argues that he could still be hesitant. For instance, following his radical change of Papal policy at Benevento, he may still not have grasped the significance of what he had done, and certainly not to the extent of radically exploiting the new policy.{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=186}} Partner suggests that Adrian was &quot;an able administrator who used able agents&quot;.{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=192}} He was also a traditionalist;{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=234}} a firm follower of Pope Gregory VII, Adrian believed it his duty to not just believe in those ideals, but to enforce them. He also believed in the necessity of reform,{{sfn|Richter|1974|p=206}} as his clarification of the marriage sacrament and enforcement of free episcopal elections demonstrates.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=191}} He was also, like Eugenius had been before him, a firm believer in the supremacy of the Bishops of Rome over both the Empire and other churches, writing how the Papacy,{{sfn|Robinson|2004|pp=323, 325}}{{blockquote|text=Like a diligent mother provides for the individual churches with constant vigilance: all must have recourse to her, as to their head and origin, to be defended by her authority, to be nourished by her breasts and freed of their oppressions.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=325}}}}

===Writings===
The 16th century Jesuit commentator Augustino Oldoini, in his re-edition of Alphonsus Ciacconius&#x27; &quot;Papal History&quot;, that Adrian had authored a number of works prior to his election. These included a treatise &quot;De Conceptione Beatissimae Virginis&quot;, a monograph, &quot;De Legationae sua&quot; and a catechism for the Scandinavian church.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Some of his correspondence survives. One such letter, from Hildegarde, exhorts him to crush the Roman commune. Joseph Baird and Radd Ehrman, editors of a collection of Hildegard&#x27;s letters, note that it was &quot;perhaps unneeded&quot;, as Adrian placed the city under Interdict almost immediately.{{sfn|Baird|Ehrman|1994|pp=20, 44}}{{refn|This particular letter has been described as expressing &quot;ideas which are themselves highly abstruse...where either the imagery is so contorted as to be intelligible only to the recipient, if in fact even to him, or as to be deliberately indecipherable&quot;, as it contains references to a large number of allegorical animals.{{sfn|Baird|Ehrman|1994|pp=20, 44}}|group=note}} Much of Adrian&#x27;s correspondence with both Archbishop Theobald and John of Salisbury has also been published in collections of the latter&#x27;s letters.{{sfn|Millor|Butler|1986|pp=ix–xii}}{{refn|In an early letter, Theobald berates Adrian for sending a messenger who &quot;has either betrayed his trust out of malice or lost them [Theobald&#x27;s letters] through negligence or has falsely pretended that they were lost&quot;, and advises Adrian to &quot;speak to your messenger at your good pleasure and, if it please you, give him instructions to carry out your business with greater caution and fidelity&quot;.{{sfn|Millor|Butler|1986|p=20}}|group=note}}

Adrian&#x27;s episcopal registry is now lost,{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=142}} although some decretals—formal rulings—survive.{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=402}}{{sfn|Heather|2014|p=401}}{{refn|This compares, however, to 713 from Alexander III&#x27;s pontificate.{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=402}}{{clarify|date=June 2020}}|group=note}} These covered such questions as to whether it was possible to restore a priest to his office when he had been responsible for the death of an apprentice, the payment of tithes, and the marriage of the unfree. Adrian&#x27;s thoughts on tithe payment also made their way into the body of Canon Law,{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=185}} and were, according to Duggan, &quot;recognised by contemporaries as having special significance, and so included in the collections of canon law being assembled at the time&quot;.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=185}}

==Personality==
{{Quote box|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=For he was very kind, mild, and patient; accomplished in English and Latin, fluent in speech, polished in eloquence. An outstanding singer, and an excellent preacher; slow to anger and swift to forgive; a cheerful giver, lavish in alms, distinguished in every aspect of his character.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=216}}|source=Cardinal Boso, &quot;Vita Adriani IV&quot; (late 1170s)|width=30em}}

The historian Colin Morris notes that Adrian&#x27;s character appears contradictory: &quot;Some historians have seen him as tough and inflexible, but others as a relatively mild man&quot; who could be manipulated by those around him. {{sfn|Morris|1989|p=190}} Duggan disputes that he was either a cypher to be manipulated by the cardinals or a &quot;prima donna&quot;. Rather, she suggests, he was &quot;a man of discipline, who fitted in with the norms and routines already in place...a man of affairs who had no fixed program, but who responded judiciously to the problems brought before his court. {{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=202}}

Adrian&#x27;s chamberlain, Boso—who later wrote Adrian&#x27;s &quot;Vita&quot;{{sfn|Eden|2006|p=292}}—described the Pope as &quot;mild and kindly in bearing, of high character and learning, famous as a preacher, and renowned for his fine voice&quot;.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} Julius Norwich describes Adrian as being eloquent, able and with &quot;outstanding good looks&quot;.{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=172}} The German antiquarian Ferdinand Gregorovius believed that by nature Adrian was &quot;as firm and as unyielding as the granite of his tomb&quot;, while Norwich tempers this suggestion, believing that, at least after Benevento, he must have been far more open to the possibilities of change.{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=186}} Duggan wonders whether he deliberately utilised these traits to forward his career. Boso&#x27;s characterisation, she suggests, &quot;could imply that he was ready to ingratiate himself with the powerful, to make friends and influence people by accommodation and charm&quot;.{{sfn|Duggan|2003b|p=198}} Sayers also suggests that something similar is detectable in the accounts from John of Salisbury,{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} a close friend to the Pope since the days of Adrian&#x27;s curial visits.{{sfn|Egger|2003|p=20}}{{refn|Indeed, R. L.

Adrian&#x27;s own view of his office, suggests Sayers, is summed up in his own words: his &quot;pallium was full of thorns and the burnished mitre seared his head&quot;, would have supposedly preferred the simple life of a canon at St Ruf.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} However, he also respected those who worked beneath him in the curia&#x27;s officialdom; on one occasion he instructed that &quot;we ought to reward such persons with ecclesiastical benefices when we conveniently can&quot;.{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=549}} This approach is reflected in the elevation of fellow Englishmen—Walter, and potentially John of Salisbury—to high office. Brooke suggests that, ultimately, Adrian &quot;had not forgot his origins; he liked to have Englishmen about him&quot;.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=12}}

His increasing control over Rome and the Patrimony demonstrate that he was an effective organiser and administrator, argues the scholar Edward Whalen.{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=125}} Duggan argues that Adrian&#x27;s strength of personality can be seen in his very election: in spite of being an outsider, a newcomer and lacking the support or patronage of an Italian noble house he attained the apotheosis of his church. And, she says, these were the qualities that made him independent.{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=153}}

His biographer, Cardinal Boso,{{refn|Boso also wrote &quot;vitae&quot; of Innocent II, Eugenius III and Alexander III.{{sfn|Luscombe|Riley-Smith|2004|p=770}}|group=note}} was a close friend who visited Adrian at Rome between November 1155 and June the following year.{{sfn|Sheehy|1961|p=58}}{{refn|Sheehy describes Boso as &quot;one of the most influential clerics in the England of his day&quot;, who later became Bishop of Chartres.{{sfn|Sheehy|1961|p=58}} He was also a good friend to the English Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, although there is no evidence, says Duggan, to suggest that he was either English or a nephew of Pope Adrian&#x27;s, as Victorian historians believed.{{sfn|Duggan|2004|pp=181, 181 n.24}}|group=note}} John&#x27;s feelings for Adrian were strong enough, indeed, for them to have been compared with, for example, that of Richard the Lionheart for Philip of France. Boswell notes that in John&#x27;s &quot;Metalogicon&quot;, he used terms reminiscent of those used by chroniclers to describe relations between the Kings.{{sfn|Boswell|1980|pp=48, 216 n.30|p=}}{{refn|The gender historian James Boswell, writing in his &quot;Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality&quot;, emphasises, however, that this does not make them, in modern terminology, &quot;latently homosexual&quot;, but rather that {{blockquote|text=John and Hadrian, who conceived of their love for each other in terms very like those used to describe the passion between the two kings, would have reacted somewhat differently to homosexual sentiments than modern churchmen, who would not describe their friendships with men in such terms&quot;.{{sfn|Boswell|1980|p=48}}}}|group=note}}

Modern historiography has not always been complimentary to Adrian. Freed argues that Adrian was capable of both shameful and specious arguments in his dispute with Barbarossa.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=252}} Likewise, David Abulafia has called Adrian &quot;petulant&quot;,{{sfn|Abulafia|1988|p=56}} and Latowsky has criticised his &quot;sarcastic&quot; manner towards Barbarossa.{{sfn|Latowsky|2013|p=163}}

==Death==

{{Quote box|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|quote=At Anagni Hadrian proclaimed the emperor excommunicate and a few days later, to cool himself down [during the hot weather] he started off for a certain fountain along with his attendants. When he got there he drank deeply and at once (according to the story), a fly entered his mouth, stuck to his throat, and could not be shifted by any device of the doctors: and as a result, the pope died.{{sfn|Maxwell-Stuart|1997|p=97}}|source=Burchard of Ursperg&#x27;s &quot;Chronicon Urspergensis&quot;, 1159|align=right|width=25em}}

By autumn 1159 it may have been clear to Adrian&#x27;s household and companions that he had not long to live. This may have been at least in part caused by the stresses of his pontificate, suggests Norwich, which although short, was difficult.{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=186}} Pope Adrian died in Anagni{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=258}}—to where he had retired for security against the Emperor{{sfn|McBrien|1997}}—from quinsy{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}{{refn|The 16th-century martyrologist John Foxe later said that this had been caused by the Pope choking on a fly.{{sfn|Oliver|1945|p=392}}|group=note}} on 1 September 1159. He died, says Norwich, &quot;as many Popes had died before him, an embittered exile; and when death came to him, he welcomed it as a friend&quot;.{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=186}} He was buried three days later{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} in an &quot;undistinguished third-century sarcophagus&quot;{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=186}} porphyry tomb of his own choosing.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=322}}{{refn|Porphory, a purple stone, was much associated with the Emperor Hadrian and had first been chosen by Innocent II and was subsequently adopted by Lucius III and Urban III.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=322}}|group=note}} In 1607, the Italian archaeologist Giovanni Francesco Grimaldi excavated the crypt and in the process opened Adrian&#x27;s tomb.

At the time of Adrian&#x27;s death, Partner argues, &quot;imperial pressure on the papacy was stronger than it had been since the time of Henry V, and it is not surprising that the cardinals were unable to agree about his successor&quot;.{{sfn|Partner|1972|p=203}} It is likely that in the months presaging his death the cardinals were aware of the likelihood of a schism occurring soon afterwards;{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=79}} Freed suggests that thanks to Adrian&#x27;s own policies, &quot;a split in the College of Cardinals was thus almost preordained&quot;, regardless of the Emperor&#x27;s input.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=257}} Ullmann suggests that it was the ideological positions of individual cardinals which was shaping—and introducing faction to—the Curia in the last months of Adrian&#x27;s pontificate.{{sfn|Ullmann|2003|p=124}} However, Norwich states that Frederick Barbarossa orchestrated the schism himself.{{sfn|Norwich|1995|p=132}}

In September 1159—now leading the Emperor&#x27;s opponents{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}—Adrian had agreed (&quot;but did not swear&quot;) to excommunicate Barbarossa.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=257}} He also did not have time to judge the request of Scottish Legates who had been in Rome since that summer, who were requesting the Diocese of St Andrews be made a metropolitan,{{sfn|Barrow|1994|p=223}} and the beatification of Waltheof of Melrose.{{sfn|Birkett|2010|p=55}}{{refn|As the scholar Helen Birkett points out, the Pope to whom the original request was sent was not to be the one who approved it. This, Birkett argues, is an example of the Papacy being seen to make grants as an institution rather than as individual popes.{{sfn|Birkett|2010|pp=55, 55 n.60}}|group=note}} One of his final acts was the blessing of his preferred successor, Bernard, Cardinal-Bishop of Porto,{{sfn|Sayers|2004}}{{refn|The letter of the law, as expressed by Cardinal Pietro Senex in 1130 that &quot;there must be no mention of the successor before the Pope is buried&quot;, was widely ignored.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=80}}|group=note}} testified Eberhard, Bishop of Bamberg to the Conclave.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=80}} This, suggests Sayers, could have been Adrian&#x27;s &quot;masterstroke&quot;. The election of Bernard—as a candidate acceptable to the Emperor—may have avoided the future schism.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} That the Cardinals ended up agreeing with Adrian&#x27;s choice indicates he had chosen wisely, argues Baumgartner.{{sfn|Baumgartner|2003b|p=32}}{{refn|Between leaving Anagni and arrival in Rome the Cardinals agreed to either elect someone from within their number who was acceptable to all, or someone from outside the college if they could not.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=258}}|group=note}}

Pope Adrian was buried in St Peter&#x27;s on 4 September 1159. Present were three Imperial ambassadors who had been in attendance on the Pope when he died. They were Otto of Wittelsbach—who had tried to beat up Cardinal Roland at Besançon—Guido of Biandrate and Heribert of Aachen.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=257}}{{refn|They were under instructions from the Emperor to either make peace with Adrian or, failing that, with the Roman commune.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=256}}|group=note}} However, as soon as the Emperor heard of the Pope&#x27;s death, says Madden, he &quot;sent a group of agents and a great deal of money to Rome&quot; in an attempt to secure the election of a successor with pro-Imperial sympathies.{{sfn|Madden|2012|p=95}}

==Later events==

The meeting between Hadrian and the city envoys of June 1159 may have discussed the next Papal election, as Adrian was known to have been accompanied by 13 cardinals who supported his pro-Sicilian policy.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|pp=79–80}}{{refn|Anne Duggan, while acknowledging that there were a small number of cardinals who can be closely identified with either side, suggests that most of Adrian&#x27;s officials were neither Imperialists or Sicilians.{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=108}}|group=note}} Cardinal Roland&#x27;s election to succeed Adrian saw both the conflict with the Empire intensify and the alliance with William of Sicily solidify.{{sfn|Barber|1992|p=236}} The schism had a knock-on effect with regard to Papal policy in Italy, making it little more than a passive observer to events on its own doorstep.{{sfn|Matthew|1992|p=263}} Papal scholar Frederic Baumgartner argues that a disputed election was the inevitable consequence whenever pope and emperor had a falling out.{{sfn|Baumgartner|2003b|p=32}} Relations between Barbarossa and Manuel, already poor—Manuel saw his western counterpart as an &quot;embarrassment&quot;, suggests Magdalino, after his falling out with Adrian—ended completely following the death of Manuel&#x27;s German wife, Bertha of Sulzbach, earlier in 1159.{{sfn|Magdalino|2004|p=622}}

Following Adrian&#x27;s death, comments Barber, &quot;the consequence for the church was another long and bitter schism&quot;.{{sfn|Barber|1992|p=103}} Tensions between different parties led to a double election, with &quot;mutually unacceptable candidates&quot;.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|pp=78–79}} This led to what Frank Barlow has called &quot;disgraceful scenes&quot; taking place in Rome, but, with neither side powerful enough to overcome the other, each appealed to the European powers.{{sfn|Barlow|1936|p=264}}

Although the Papal forces were insufficient to defeat Barbarossa outright, the war in Lombardy gradually turned against the Emperor, and following the recognition of the Kings of France and England, the military situation became more evenly balanced.{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=127}} However, peace was not established between the Papacy, the Empire, Sicily and the Byzantine Emperor until Barbarossa was defeated at the Battle of Legnano in 1176 and the following year&#x27;s Treaty of Venice.{{sfn|Metcalfe|2009|p=173}} The schism continued until the election of Pope Alexander III in 1180. During this time the Emperor&#x27;s chancery distributed a series of fake letters—some of which purported to have been written by Adrian—in defence of the Imperial candidate.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=215}} One such letter, supposedly to Archbishop Hillin of Trier, comments Latowsky, &quot;is of particular interest since it contains a deliberately erroneous rewriting of Charlemagne&#x27;s assumption of the imperial title&quot;.In it, Adrian launches into a diatribe, condemning the German kings who owe everything to the Papacy yet refuse to understand that. This letter, argues Latowsky, was clearly intended to enrage its Imperial audience.{{sfn|Latowsky|2013|pp=161, 164}} 

Another letter, from the Emperor to Archbishop, called Adrian&#x27;s church as &quot;a sea of snakes&quot;, a &quot;den of thieves and a house of demons&quot; and Adrian himself as &quot;he who claims to be the Vicar of Peter, but is not&quot;.{{sfn|Latowsky|2013|p=163}} Adrian, in turn, says the Emperor is &quot;out of his mind&quot;.{{sfn|Latowsky|2013|p=170}} Containing as they did summaries of each sides&#x27; arguments at Besançon, they are most interesting, argues Freed, for indicating what Barbarossa to have believed to have been the most important of his and Adrian&#x27;s arguments.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=215}}{{blockquote|text=From the time when friendship was established at Benevento between the lord Pope Hadrian and William of Sicily. contrary to the honour of God&#x27;s Church and of the empire, great division and discord have arisen (not without cause) among the cardinals...blinded by money and many promises and firmly bound to the Sicilian, wickedly defended the treaty.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=79}}|blockquote}}

Further afield, war was threatening between England and France.{{sfn|Godman|2000|p=173}} Lands lost by Adrian to Sicily at the Treaty of Benevento were eventually regained by Pope Innocent III early in the next century, by which time the Kingdom of Sicily had merged with the Empire.{{refn|The Papal lands would effectively stay this way until the annexation of the Papal States in 1870.{{sfn|Collins|2009|p=256}}|group=note}} Innocent saw Adrian&#x27;s original grant as detracting from the privilege of the Apostolic See, and made concerted and eventually successful efforts to evict the Empire from southern Italy.{{sfn|Powell|2004|pp=19–20}}

===1159 Papal Conclave===
The 1159 papal election was disputed, and the College of Cardinals split along sectarian lines, between the &quot;Sicilian&quot;—so-called as its members wished to continue the pro-William policy of Adrian—and &quot;Imperial&quot; sympathisers. The former supported the candidacy of Cardinal Roland; the latter that of Ottaviano de Monticelli. Roland was elected Pope Alexander III. The result was not accepted by his opponents, who elected an Antipope, Victor IV,{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=53}}{{refn|Not to be confused with the Antipapacy of Cardinal Gregorio Conti, who had previously taken the title Victor IV in 1138.{{sfn|Palgrave|1921|p=730}}|group=note}} whom John of Salisbury had previously mocked.{{sfn|Whalen|2014|p=127}} The Imperial party disagreed with the new policy of &quot;rapprochement&quot; with Sicily and favoured the traditional alliance with the Empire.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=79}} A missive of the Imperial party of electors claimed that Adrian was a &quot;dupe&quot; of the Sicilian faction within the cardinals.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=470}} Indicative of Barbarossa&#x27;s attitude towards his candidate was his willingness to serve Victor as he had objected to serving Adrian, for example by holding the Antipope&#x27;s horse and kissing his feet.{{sfn|Freed|2016|p=257}}The conclave to elect Adrian&#x27;s successor, says Ullmann, was a &quot;riotous and undignified spectacle&quot;.{{sfn|Ullmann|2003|p=124}} Alexander was elected by two-thirds of the college, while Victor&#x27;s support declined from nine to five cardinals.{{sfn|Robinson|1996|p=53}} Two further antipopes were elected before Alexander&#x27;s death in 1181 and a unity candidate was found.{{sfn|Barber|1992|p=103}} Alexander was left a problematic legacy by Adrian, who had guaranteed a powerful enemy for the Papacy in the Emperor. Alexander managed to negotiate successive crises, however, and held its own.{{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Within a year, Emperor Manuel had recognised Alexander,{{sfn|Magdalino|1993|p=64}} as had the English King Henry, although the latter waited nine months to do so.{{sfn|Duggan|2007|p=169}}{{refn|Henry subsequently assumed that he had Alexander&#x27;s backing vis a vis the English church as a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; for supporting his pontifical election. This was not, however, to be, and Alexander later condemned many of Henry&#x27;s policies.{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=356}}|group=note}} Although Octavian received less curial support in the conclave, he had the support of the Roman commune.

In the 14th century Adrian was recorded in St Albans&#x27; &quot;Book of Benefactors&quot;, which, suggests Bolton, &quot;ensured that the memory of the English Pope would remain forever&quot;.{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=96}} The 19th-century antiquarian Bishop Stubbs described Adrian IV as, in his view, &quot;a great pope; that is a great constructive pope, not a controversial one, like those who preceded and followed&quot;.{{sfn|Stubbs|1887|p=151}} Walter Ullmann argues that Adrian&#x27;s pontificate &quot;left an imprint upon contemporary Europe which is not yet fully recognised&quot;.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=233}} 

One reviewer has described Adrian&#x27;s pontificate as, traditionally, &quot;largely remembered as the answer to a trivia question (who was the only English pope?) or as a footnote in Anglo-Irish history&quot;.{{sfn|Hakkenberg|2004|p=212}} On the other hand, the Dixie Professor of Ecclesiastical History, Christopher N. L. Brooke argues that, on account of the number of different countries he dwelt in over the years, he illustrates the cosmopolitan nature of 12th-century religion.{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=3}}{{sfn|Brooke|2003|p=6}}

The timing of Adrian&#x27;s pontificate, suggests Ullmann, was significant because it made him the first pope on which what Ullmann calls &quot;newly released forces&quot;—the recently crowned King Henry and Emperor Frederick.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=234}}{{refn|Ullmann labels Henry II and Frederick I &quot;classic examples of the reinvigorated royalist-lay ideology&quot;.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=234}}|group=note}} On the other hand, argues Egger, Adrian—by rejecting the request of Kings Louis and Henry to crusade in Spain—undoubtedly prevented the secular power from embarrassing themselves: &quot;one can only speculate about what might have happened, but it is not improbable that Adrian spared the Iberian peninsula a disaster on the scale of the second crusade to the East&quot;.{{sfn|Smith|2003|p=39}}

Morris argues that while &quot;in a short pontificate, Hadrian did more than any of his predecessors to secure the papal position in central Italy...he was much less successful in his conduct of relations with the empire&quot;.{{sfn|Morris|1989|p=191}} Norwich too strikes a cautionary note. While agreeing that Adrian was &quot;the greatest pope since Urban II&quot;, he argues that it would be difficult not to &quot;tower...above the string of mediocrities who occupied the throne of St Peter during the first half of the century, just as he himself is overshadowed by his magnificent successor&quot;.{{sfn|Norwich|1970|p=186}} Duggan argues that, although &quot;the future of the papacy was to be determined by other men and other events, but he had played his part in guiding it securely through an extremely critical phase of its long history&quot;.{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=155}}

Ullmann has called Adrian &quot;diplomatically very well versed and experienced, dispassionate and purposeful in his government&quot;.{{sfn|Ullmann|2003|p=122}} Adrian—&quot;the pope of action&quot;, says Ullmann—was Papal theory &quot;become eminently practical&quot;.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=233}} He was not, however, a dictator. Likewise, suggests the historian Christopher Tyerman, Adrian&#x27;s new approach to drumming up support for a crusade in 1157 became &quot;a pivotal feature of crusading from the reign of Innocent III onwards&quot;.{{sfn|Tyerman|1998|p=15}} Innocent himself recognised the debt which he owed to Adrian&#x27;s pontificate, argues Ullmann.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=234}} Innocent codified Adrian&#x27;s changes to the Imperial coronation as official procedure.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=241}} Even the Besançon affair, suggests Ullmann, casts him in a positive light, and &quot;by his dignified stand against Staufen attacks appears like a rock in comparison with the clamorous Germans&quot;.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=244}}

The period immediately preceding Adrian&#x27;s pontificate, argues Malcolm Barber, was one where &quot;even without a direct imperial threat, Roman feuds, Norman ambitions and incompetently led crusades could reduce grandiose papal plans to ashes&quot;.{{sfn|Barber|1992|p=99}} The Papacy itself was one of permanent struggle and conflict, although scholars disagree as to the degree of culpability the papacy had for this. Duggan suggests that &quot;no fair judgment should be reached without recognising the vulnerability&quot; of the papacy itself. His policy, if he can be said to have one, she says, was shaped by events rather than shaping them.{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=109}} Ullmann argues that there was &quot;a perfect concordance between Adrian&#x27;s symbolic actions and his acts of government&quot;.{{sfn|Ullmann|1955|p=239}} Adrian and his pro-Scicillian cardinals, suggests Duggan, became scapegoats in 1159 for the subsequent conflict.{{sfn|Duggan|2003a|p=107}}

Sayers describes Adrian IV as &quot;a true son of the reforming papacy&quot;.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} However, the Papal reform movement does not appear to have had faith that Adrian would carry out its program, as leading reformers of the day—such as Gerhoh of Reichersberg and Hildegard of Bingen, for example—sought the church&#x27;s renewal other ways.{{sfn|Daniel|2004|p=8}} Chris Wickham credits Adrian with beginning the process by which the popes expanded their Patrimony. Adrian brought Rome brought back under firm Papal control{{sfn|Wickham|2015|pp=39, 51}}—with considerable success, argues Wickham,{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=419}} and also expanded the Papal estate around the city, particularly in the northern Lazio region.{{sfn|Wickham|2015|pp=39, 51}}

Although his Papacy was shorter than either Eugenius III or Alexander III he bought more castles and lordships within papal jurisdiction than either of them, and in a more onerous political context.{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=178}} He was also a tougher pope than his two immediate predecessors, says Wickham{{sfn|Wickham|2015|p=445}} and his was an &quot;extremely formative&quot; Papacy, says Sayers, and his policy of reform was a legacy taken up again by reforming popes of the 13th century.{{sfn|Sayers|2004}} His Papacy though, suggests Eden, was &quot;fraught with political intrigue and conflict&quot;.{{sfn|Eden|2006|p=293}} Adrian has been described as having &quot;theocratic pretensions&quot;,{{sfn|Pixton|2001|p=727}} although it was also during his pontificate that the term &quot;Vicar of Christ&quot; became a common synonym for the Pope.{{sfn|McBrien|1997}}

Henry Summerson suggests that on his death, Adrian &quot;left a high reputation&quot;, and quotes the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; in saying that he also became &quot;something of a role model for later popes&quot;.{{sfn|Summerson|2004}} The scholar Michael Frassetto suggests that blame for the poor relations between Adrian and Frederick can be placed as much upon their advisors—Roland and Reinald specifically—who both &quot;stressed principle over compromise&quot;.{{sfn|Frassetto|2001|p=296}} Summerson also notes that although England provided no subsequent popes, relations between that country and the Papacy remained strong after Adrian&#x27;s death and into the 13th century.{{refn|Culminating, suggest Summerson, after King John made the country a Papal fief in 1215.{{sfn|Summerson|2004}}|group=note}} Adrian&#x27;s generous treatment of St Albans also had repercussions. He had granted it privileges of such breadth and grandeur—which were confirmed by his successors—that they caused rancour and jealousy in the English church.{{sfn|Bolton|2003a|p=95}}

Ullman suggests that it was Adrian who began the restoration of the Papal monarchy that would reach its apotheosis under Innocent III,{{sfn|Ullmann|2003|p=122}} while Bolton argues that &quot;only Innocent, the great Roman, realised the value to the papacy of following where Adrian, the unique Englishman, had led&quot;.{{sfn|Bolton|2003b|p=178}}

Nicholas Breakspear School in St Albans, England, built in 1963, is named in his honour.

<text>Pope Adrian V (; – 18 August 1276), born Ottobuono de&#x27; Fieschi, was the head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 11 July 1276 to his death on 18 August 1276. He was an envoy of Pope Clement IV sent to England in May 1265 who successfully completed his task of resolving disputes between King Henry III of England and his barons. Adrian V was elected pope following the death of Innocent V, but died of natural illness before being ordained to the priesthood.

In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Dante meets Adrian V in the fifth terrace of &quot;Purgatorio&quot; where Adrian V cleanses for the vice of avarice.

==Biography==
Ottobuono belonged to a feudal family of Liguria, the Fieschi, counts of Lavagna. His first clerical position came in 1243, when he was created a papal chaplain. Subsequently, he received several ecclesiastical benefices, becoming archdeacon in Bologna (1244) and Parma (1244/48–1255), canon and chancellor of the cathedral chapter in Reims (1243–1250), canon and dean of the chapter in Piacenza (c. 1247) and canon of the cathedral chapter in Paris (1244/45–1270). In December 1251, he was created Cardinal Deacon of San Adriano by his uncle Pope Innocent IV. He was also archpriest of the patriarchal Liberian Basilica (attested from 1262).

He was sent to England in 1265 by Pope Clement IV to mediate between King Henry III of England and his barons, and to preach the Crusades. Fieschi was related distantly, by affinity, to Henry III; his sister had married Thomas II of Savoy, who was a cousin of Henry&#x27;s wife, Eleanor of Provence.

He remained in England for several years as the papal legate, serving from October 1265 to July 1268. His diplomatic position was such that his name is still on the oldest extant piece of English statute law, the Statute of Marlborough of 1267, where the formal title mentions as a witness &quot;the Lord Ottobon, at that time legate in England&quot;. (Also on this legation was a young diplomat, the future Boniface VIII.) In April 1268 he issued a set of canons, which formed the basis of church law in England until the Protestant Reformation of the sixteenth century.

Under the influence of Charles I of Anjou, he was elected pope to succeed Innocent V on 11 July 1276 but died at Viterbo on 18 August 1276 from illness without ever having been ordained to the priesthood. He is buried there in the church of San Francesco alla Rocca. His funeral monument is attributed to Arnolfo di Cambio. Adrian V was the third pope in the &quot;Year of Four Popes&quot; of 1276.

He annulled Pope Gregory X&#x27;s bull on the holding of papal conclaves, but died before enacting new regulations.

=== Pope Adrian V in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; ===
In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Dante Alighieri meets Pope Adrian V in the fifth terrace of &quot;Purgatorio&quot; (reserved for the avaricious and the prodigal) where Adrian V cleanses for the vice of avarice (&quot;Purgatorio&quot; 19.79-145). Since the souls in this terrace purge their vices by facing down on earth and fixing their eyes on the ground, Adrian V’s identity is not revealed by facial recognition but through indirect inference. His papal identity is inferred from his Latin phrase, &quot;scias quod ego fui successor Petri&quot; (&quot;I was Peter’s successor,&quot; &quot;Purgatorio&quot; 19.99), and by his words &quot;fui&quot; &quot;roman pastore&quot; (&quot;I was a Roman shepherd,&quot; &quot;Purgatorio&quot; 19.107). These phrases reveal the papal identity of Adrian V, given that popes are successors of the first pope, Saint Peter, and shepherds of the church in the teachings of the Catholic Church. Adrian V also describes his family name as being descended from those that reside between Sestri and Chiavari (&quot;Purgatorio&quot; 19.100-102). This reveals his family title, Fieschi, as the family held extensive land between the two cities.

There exists a lack of historical evidence about Adrian V’s avaricious behavior. Some scholars believe that Dante’s view of Adrian V emanated from reading excerpts from John of Salisbury&#x27;s &quot;Policraticus&quot;, in which the author anonymously attributed the behavior of avarice to Adrian IV. Dante likely interpreted the excerpts as referring to Adrian V instead of Adrian IV.

Despite the possible misinterpretation of Adrian V’s character, his presence in the &quot;Comedy&quot; help to understand Dante’s views about the Church and the role of women in achieving man’s salvation. Pope Adrian V’s representation of avarice reflects the zealous ambition for earthly power and goods. Adrian V describes that he had to detach himself from the love of worldly things that came to be after he was assigned the papal sit in the short period he was a pope (&quot;Purgatorio&quot; 19.106-114). This symbolizes Dante’s view of how avarice was at the heart of the church and popes in the Middle Ages were excessively drawn to earthly things and preoccupied with exercising power. Moreover, Adrian V outlines not only his avarice but also the corrupt nature of his family, with the exception of his niece, Alagia Fieschi (&quot;Purgatorio&quot; 19.142-145). In a melancholic tone, Adrian V expresses how Alagia is the only remaining virtuous woman whose extension of prayer can help his journey of salvation. Alagia&#x27;s portrayal reflects Dante’s view of how Christian women play a miraculous role in men’s achievement of salvation through their prayer.

<text>Pope John XXI (, ; – 20 May 1277), born Pedro Julião (), was the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church from 8 September 1276 to his death. He is the only ethnically Portuguese pope in history. He is sometimes identified with the logician and herbalist Peter of Spain (; ), which would make him the only pope to have been a physician.

==Early life==
Pedro Julião was born in Lisbon between 1210 and 1220 to Julião Pais, chancellor of Sancho I and Afonso Henriques, and his wife Mor Mendes. He started his studies at the episcopal school of Lisbon Cathedral and later joined the University of Paris, although some historians claim that he was educated at Montpellier. Wherever he studied, he concentrated on medicine, theology, logic, physics, metaphysics, and Aristotle&#x27;s dialectic. He is traditionally and usually identified with the medical author Peter of Spain, an important figure in the development of logic and pharmacology. Peter of Spain taught at the University of Siena in the 1240s and his &quot;&quot; was used as a university textbook on Aristotelian logic for the next three centuries. At the court in Lisbon, he was the councilor and spokesman for King Afonso III in church matters. Later, he became prior of Guimarães.

He was Archdeacon of Vermoim (Vermuy) in the Archdiocese of Braga. He tried to become bishop of Lisbon but was defeated. Instead, he became the Master of the school of Lisbon. Peter became the physician of Pope Gregory X (1271–1276) early in his reign. In March 1273, he was elected Archbishop of Braga, but did not assume that post; instead, on 3 June 1273, Pope Gregory X created him Cardinal Bishop of Tusculum (Frascati).

==Papacy==

After the death of Pope Adrian V on 18 August 1276, Peter was elected pope on 8 September. He was crowned a week later on 20 September. One of John XXI&#x27;s few acts during his brief reign was the reversal of a decree recently passed at the Second Council of Lyon (1274); the decree had not only confined cardinals in solitude until they elected a successor pope, but also progressively restricted their supplies of food and wine if their deliberations took too long. Though much of John XXI&#x27;s brief papacy was dominated by the powerful Cardinal Giovanni Gaetano Orsini, who succeeded him as Pope Nicholas III, John attempted to launch a crusade for the Holy Land, pushed for a union with the Eastern church, and did what he could to maintain peace between the Christian nations.

Among his other acts, he excommunicated Afonso III of Portugal for interfering with episcopal elections and sent legates to Kublai Khan. He also launched a mission to convert the Tatars, but he died before it could start.

To secure the necessary quiet for his medical studies, he had an apartment added to the papal palace at Viterbo, to which he could retire when he wished to work undisturbed. On 14 May 1277, while the pope was alone in this apartment, the ceiling collapsed; John was rescued alive from beneath the rubble; however, he died of his serious injuries on 20 May, possibly an early recorded case of crush syndrome.

He was buried in the Duomo di Viterbo, where his tomb can still be seen. The original porphyry sarcophagus was destroyed during the cathedral&#x27;s 16th-century refurbishment, and was replaced with a more modest one in stone with the pope&#x27;s effigy. In the 19th century, the Duke of Saldanha, as Portuguese Ambassador to the Holy See, had the pope&#x27;s remains transferred to a new sarcophagus sculpted by Filippo Gnaccarini. In 2000, the Lisbon City Council, led by Mayor João Soares, successfully had a new funeral monument built in lioz stone, topped by the original stone effigy of the pope, placed in a more condign location in the transept.

== Legacy ==
After his death, it was rumored that John XXI had actually been a necromancer, a suspicion frequently directed towards the few scholars among medieval popes (see, e.g., Sylvester II). It was also said that his death had been an act of God, stopping him from completing a heretical treatise. Since the works of &quot;Peter of Spain&quot; continued to be studied and appreciated, however, Dante Alighieri placed &quot;Pietro Spano&quot; in his &quot;Paradiso&#x27;s&quot; Sphere of the Sun with the spirits of other great religious scholars.

<doc id="23831" wikidata="Q57087" url="?curid=23831" title="Pope Adrian VI">
<text>Pope Adrian VI (; ; ; ), born Adriaan Florensz Boeyens (2 March 1459 – 14 September 1523), was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 9 January 1522 until his death on 14 September 1523. The only Dutchman to become pope, he was the last non-Italian pope until the Polish John Paul II 455 years later.

Born in the Episcopal principality of Utrecht of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation, Adrian studied at the University of Leuven in the Low Countries, where he rose to the position of professor of theology, also serving as its rector (the equivalent of president or vice-chancellor). In 1507, he became the tutor of the future Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who later trusted him as both his emissary and his regent. In 1516, Charles, now King of Castile and Aragon, appointed Adrian bishop of Tortosa, Spain, and soon thereafter Grand Inquisitor of the kingdoms of Aragon and Castile. Pope Leo X made him a cardinal in 1517 and after Leo&#x27;s death he was elected pope in 1522 as a compromise candidate.

Adrian came to the papacy in the midst of one of its greatest crises, threatened not only by Lutheranism to the north but also by the advance of the Ottoman Turks to the east. He refused to compromise with Lutheranism theologically, demanding Luther&#x27;s condemnation as a heretic. However, he is noted for having attempted to reform the Catholic Church administration in response to the Protestant Reformation. Adrian&#x27;s admission that the Roman Curia itself was at fault for the turmoil in the Church was read at the 1522–1523 Diet of Nuremberg.

His efforts at reform proved fruitless, as they were resisted by most of his contemporaries, and he did not live long enough to see his efforts through to their conclusion. He was succeeded by the second Medici pope, Clement VII. Adrian VI and Marcellus II are the only popes of the modern era to retain their baptismal names after their election. Adrian VI is the last pope to date to take on the pontifical name &quot;Adrian&quot;.

==Early life==

Adriaan Florensz was born on 2 March 1459 in the city of Utrecht, which was then the capital of the Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht, a part of the Burgundian Netherlands in the Holy Roman Empire. He was born into modest circumstances as the son of Florens Boeyensz, also born in Utrecht, and his wife Geertruid. He had three older brothers, Jan, Cornelius, and Claes. Adrian consistently signed with &quot;Adrianus Florentii&quot; or &quot;Adrianus de Traiecto&quot; (&quot;Adrian of Utrecht&quot;) in later life, suggesting that his family did not yet have a surname but used patronymics only.

Adrian was probably raised in a house on the corner of the Brandstraat and Oude Gracht that was owned by his grandfather Boudewijn (Boeyen, for short). His father, a carpenter and likely shipwright, died when Adrian was 10 years or younger. Adrian studied from a very young age under the Brethren of the Common Life, either at Zwolle or Deventer and was also a student of the Latin school (now &quot;Gymnasium Celeanum&quot;) in Zwolle.

==Leuven==
In June 1476, he started his studies at the University of Leuven, where he pursued philosophy, theology and Canon Law, thanks to a scholarship granted by Margaret of York, Duchess of Burgundy. In 1478 he had the title of &quot;Primus Philosophiae&quot;, as well as that of &quot;Magister Artium&quot; (that is, he took his undergraduate degree). In 1488 he was chosen by the Faculty of Arts to be their representative on the Council of the university.

On 30 June 1490, Adrian was ordained a priest.

After the regular 12 years of study, Adrian became a Doctor of Theology in 1491. He had been a teacher at the university since 1490, was chosen vice-chancellor of the university in 1493, and Dean of St. Peter&#x27;s in 1498. In the latter function he was permanent vice-chancellor of the university and de facto in charge of hiring. His lectures were published, as recreated from his students&#x27; notes; among those who attended was the young Erasmus. Adrian offered him a professorate in 1502, but Erasmus refused.

In November 1506 Margaret of Austria, Duchess of Savoy, became Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands and chose Adrian as her advisor. The next year Emperor Maximilian I appointed him also tutor to his seven-year-old grandson, and Margaret&#x27;s nephew, who in 1519 became Emperor Charles V. By 1512 Adrian was Charles&#x27;s advisor, and his court obligations were so time-consuming that he quit his positions at the university.

==Spain==
In 1515, Charles sent Adrian to Spain to convince his maternal grandfather, Ferdinand II of Aragon, that the Spanish lands should come under his rule, and not Charles&#x27;s Spanish-born younger brother Ferdinand, whom his grandfather had in mind. Adrian succeeded in that just before Ferdinand&#x27;s death in January 1516. Ferdinand of Aragon, and subsequently Charles V, appointed Adrian Bishop of Tortosa, which was approved by Pope Leo X on 18 August 1516. He was consecrated by Bishop Diego Ribera de Toledo.

On 14 November 1516 the King commissioned him Inquisitor General of Aragon.

In his fifth Consistory for the creation of cardinals, on 1 July 1517, Pope Leo X (1513–21) named thirty-one cardinals among whom was Adrianus de Traiecto, naming him Cardinal-Priest of the Basilica of Santi Giovanni e Paolo on the Caelian Hill.

During the minority of Charles V, Adrian was named to serve with Cardinal Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros as co-regent of Spain. After the death of Jimenez, Adrian was appointed (14 March 1518) General of the Reunited Inquisitions of Castile and Aragon, in which capacity he acted until his departure for Rome. When Charles V left Spain for the Netherlands in 1520, he appointed Cardinal Adrian Regent of Spain, during which time he had to deal with the Revolt of the Comuneros.
==Papal election==

In the conclave after the death of the Medici Pope Leo X, Leo&#x27;s cousin, Cardinal Giulio de&#x27; Medici, was the leading figure. With Spanish and French cardinals in a deadlock, the absent Adrian was proposed as a compromise and on 9 January 1522 he was elected by an almost unanimous vote. Charles V was delighted upon hearing that his tutor had been elected to the papacy but soon realised that Adrian VI was determined to reign impartially. Francis I of France, who feared that Adrian would become a tool of the Emperor, and had uttered threats of a schism, later relented and sent an embassy to present his homage.

Fears of a Spanish Avignon based on the strength of his relationship with the Emperor as his former tutor and regent proved baseless, and Adrian, having notified the College of Cardinals of his acceptance, left for Italy after six months of preparations and trying to decide which route to take, making his solemn entry into Rome on 29 August. He had forbidden elaborate decorations, and many people stayed away for fear of the plague that was raging. Pope Adrian was crowned at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica on 31 August 1522, at the age of 63.

===Reformer===
He immediately entered upon the path of the reformer. The 1908 edition of the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; characterised the task that faced him:

:&quot;&quot;To extirpate inveterate abuses; to reform a court which thrived on corruption, and detested the very name of reform; to hold in leash young and warlike princes, ready to bound at each other&#x27;s throats; to stem the rising torrent of revolt in Germany; to save Christendom from the Turks, who from Belgrade now threatened Hungary, and if Rhodes fell would be masters of the Mediterranean - these were herculean labours for one who was in his sixty-third year, had never seen Italy, and was sure to be despised by the Romans as a &#x27;barbarian&#x27;.&quot;

His plan was to attack notorious abuses one by one; however, in his attempt to improve the system of indulgences he was hampered by his cardinals. He found reduction of the number of matrimonial dispensations to be impossible, as the income had been farmed out for years in advance by Pope Leo X.

==Papacy==

Adrian VI was not successful as a peacemaker among Christian princes, whom he hoped to unite in a war against the Turks. In August 1523 he was forced into an alliance with the Empire, England, and Venice against France; meanwhile, in 1522 Suleiman the Magnificent (1520–66) had conquered Rhodes.
In his reaction to the early stages of the Lutheran revolt, Adrian VI did not completely understand the gravity of the situation. At the Diet of Nuremberg, which opened in December 1522, he was represented by Francesco Chieregati, whose private instructions contain the frank admission that the disorder of the Church was perhaps the fault of the Roman Curia itself, and that it should be reformed. However, the former professor and Inquisitor General was strongly opposed to any change in doctrine and demanded that Martin Luther be punished for teaching heresy.

He made only one cardinal in the course of his pontificate, Willem van Enckevoirt, made a cardinal-priest in a consistory held on 10 September 1523.

Adrian VI held no beatifications in his pontificate but canonized Saints Antoninus of Florence and Benno of Meissen on 31 May 1523.

Charles V&#x27;s ambassador in Rome, Juan Manuel, lord of Belmonte, wrote that he was worried that Charles&#x27;s influence over Adrian waned after Adrian&#x27;s election, writing &quot;The Pope is &quot;deadly afraid&quot; of the College of Cardinals. He does whatever two or three cardinals write to him in the name of the college.&quot;

==Death==
Adrian VI died in Rome on 14 September 1523, after one year, eight months and six days as pope. Most of his official papers were lost after his death. He published &quot;Quaestiones in quartum sententiarum praesertim circa sacramenta&quot; (Paris, 1512, 1516, 1518, 1537; Rome, 1522), and &quot;Quaestiones quodlibeticae XII.&quot; (1st ed., Leuven, 1515). He is buried in the Santa Maria dell&#x27;Anima church in Rome.

He bequeathed property in the Low Countries for the foundation of a college at the University of Leuven that became known as Pope&#x27;s College.

==In popular culture==
The first series of engravings used to educate Dutch school children at the turn of the 18th century includes Adrian VI in its woodcut on &#x27;Famous Dutch Men and Women&#x27; with the following poem:
:&quot;In Utrecht wijst men nog dit huis den vreemdeling aan, &quot;
:&quot;En noemt het om zijn naam &#x27;t huis van Paus Adriaan,&quot;
:&quot;Nog praalt &#x27;s mans borstbeeld in den gevel. Min verheven&quot;
:&quot;Was &#x27;t het stamhuis van dien Paus, een schuitemakers zoon,&quot;
:&quot;Zijn naam blijft nog vol lof op duizend tongen zweeven,&quot;
:&quot;Kort droeg hij, maar met roem, de pauselijke kroon.&quot;&#x27;

:&quot;In Utrecht they still point out this house to strangers,&quot;
:&quot;And name it after him: the house of pope Adrian,&quot;
:&quot;Still his bust stands in its façade. Less elevated&quot;
:&quot;Was the ancestry of this pope, the son of a boat builder,&quot;
:&quot;His name is still proudly spoken by thousands of tongues,&quot;
:&quot;Only briefly, but with honor, he wore the papal crown.&quot;

Pope Adrian VI appears as a character in Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s stage drama &quot;The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus&quot; (1604).

<text>Pope Anastasius III (c. 865 — June 913) was the bishop of Rome and ruler of the Papal States from April 911 to his death.

Anastasius was a Roman by birth. A Roman nobleman, Lucian, is sometimes recognized as his father, although other sources assert that he was the illegitimate son of his predecessor, Pope Sergius III.

Almost nothing is recorded of Pope Anastasius III, his pontificate falling in the period when Rome and the papacy were in the power of Theophylact I of Tusculum and Theodora, who approved Anastasius III&#x27;s candidacy. Under his reign, the Normans of Rollo were evangelized. Anastasius III&#x27;s papacy faced renewed threats from the Saracens, after they established themselves on the Garigliano river. He was buried in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

<text>Pope Anastasius IV ( – 3 December 1154), born Corrado Demetri della Suburra, was head of the Catholic Church and ruler of the Papal States from 8 July 1153 to his death in 1154. He is the most recent pope to take the name &quot;Anastasius&quot; upon his election.

==Early life==
He was a Roman, son of Benedictus de Suburra, probably of the family of Demetri, and became a secular clerk. He was created cardinal-priest of S. Pudenziana by Pope Paschal II no later than in 1114. In 1127 or 1128, Pope Honorius II promoted him to the suburbicarian See of Sabina. He was probably given this position for siding with Honorius II during a dispute over the appointment of a new abbot of Farfa. He had taken part in the double papal election of 1130, had been one of the most determined opponents of Antipope Anacletus II and, when Pope Innocent II fled to France, had been left behind as his vicar in Italy. At the time of his election to the papacy in July 1153, he was Dean of the College of Cardinals and probably the oldest member of that body.

==Pontificate==
During his short pontificate, he played the part of a peacemaker; he came to terms with the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in the vexing question of the appointment to the See of Magdeburg and closed the long quarrel, which had raged through four pontificates, about the appointment of William Fitzherbert (commonly known as Saint William of York) to the see of York by sending him the pallium in spite of the continued opposition of the powerful Cistercian order. Anastasius IV also devoted much time and expenses on the Lateran Basilica and Palace back at Rome.

Anastasius IV died on 3 December 1154 and was succeeded by Cardinal Nicholas Breakspear as Pope Adrian IV. Anastasius IV was laid to rest within the Helena sarcophagus which was brought out and reused as his tomb.

<text>Pope Anastasius II (died 19 November 498) was the bishop of Rome from 24 November 496 to his death. He was an important figure in trying to end the Acacian schism, but his efforts resulted in the Laurentian schism, which followed his death. Anastasius was born in Rome, the son of a priest, and is buried in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

Pope Anastasius II is one of only two popes in the first 500 years of church history not to be canonized a saint in Catholic Church. Pope Liberius is also omitted from sainthood in the Catholic Church, although he is considered a saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

==Acacian schism and conciliation==
The church had been in a serious doctrinal dispute since 484, between the Eastern and Western churches of Christianity, known as the Acacian schism. Popes Felix III (483–492) and Gelasius I (492–496) had generally taken hardline stances towards the Eastern church and had excommunicated many of the major religious figures including Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople. Efforts at reducing the problem by Zeno were not recognized by Felix III or Gelasius I and so there was a large schism between the churches. Upon the death of Gelasius I, Anastasius II was named pope largely with support from a faction that wanted to improve relations between the West and the Eastern churches and end the schism.

Upon being named pope, Anastasius II immediately sent two bishops to Constantinople to meet with the Byzantine Emperor Anastasius I, who had the same name as the pope, and work on an agreement to end the Acacian schism. Anastasius II indicated in a letter that he was willing to accept the baptisms that had been performed by Acacius and to let the issue be decided by the divine rather than by church authorities and Anastasius I seemed similarly willing to cooperate but wanted acceptance of the &quot;Henotikon&quot;, the compromise position developed by Zeno. As a signal of attempting to reduce the tension, Anastasius II was rumored to have given communion to Photinus of Thessalonica, an associate of Acacius.

The result of these conciliatory gestures was to outrage many of the bishops and clergy in Rome and to create a clear division between those who supported moderation toward the Monophysites in the Byzantine Empire and those who opposed such moderation. Because of the communion with Photinus, many in Rome refused to receive communion from Anastasius II and the situation grew to a crisis point.

==Death and legacy==

At the peak of the tension created by these attempts to improve relations between the East and the West, Anastasius II unexpectedly died. For those who opposed his attempts at remedying the schism his death in 498 was seen as divine retribution. The factions that had formed during his rule as pope split decisively from one another and each appointed a rival pope. The faction against conciliation was able to name Symmachus as the pope to follow Anastasius II. However, the important Roman Senator Rufius Postumius Festus, who had been a major instigator for the conciliation attempts of Anastasius II and may have led to his naming as pope, supported a rival papal claim of Laurentius. The Roman church then had its own schism between different factions which made efforts at reducing the schism between the church in Rome and the church in Constantinople impossible.

During the medieval period, Anastasius II was often considered a traitor to the Catholic Church and an apostate. The writer of the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, supporting the opponents to Anastasius&#x27; efforts, argued that Anastasius II&#x27;s death was divine retribution and that he had broken with the church. Similarly, the &quot;Decretum Gratiani&quot; writes of the pope that &quot;Anastasius, reproved by God, was smitten by divine command.&quot; This medieval view is described by modern commentators as a &quot;legend&quot;, a &quot;misinterpretation&quot;, a &quot;confused tradition&quot;, and &quot;manifestly unjust.&quot;

Dante placed Anastasius II in the sixth circle of hell: &quot;Anastasio papa guardo, lo qual trasse Fotin de la via dritta&quot; (&quot;I guard Pope Anastasius, he whom Photinus drew from the straight path&quot;). However, modern Dante scholars consider this to be a mistake: the person Dante intended to put at that level was the Byzantine emperor of the time, Anastasius I.

Anastasius II is, with Pope Liberius, one of only two of the first 50 popes not to be canonized. However, Liberius is mentioned in the Greek Menology and is recognized as a saint within the Eastern Orthodox Church.

<text>Pope Anastasius I was the bishop of Rome from 27 November 399 to his death on 19 December 401.

Anastasius was born in Rome, and was the son of Maximus. He succeeded Siricius as pope and condemned the writings of the Alexandrian theologian Origen shortly after their translation into Latin. He fought against these writings throughout his papacy, and in 400 he called a council to discuss them. The council agreed that Origen was not faithful to the Church.

During his reign, he also encouraged Christians in North Africa to fight Donatism. He instructed priests to stand and bow their head as they read from the gospels. Among his friends were Augustine, Jerome, and Paulinus. Jerome speaks of him as a man of great holiness who was rich in his poverty. He died in Rome and was eventually buried in the Catacomb of Pontian together with his immediate successor, Innocent I. Jerome also referred to Anastasius as Innocent&#x27;s father, although scholars have argued this was displaying a hierarchical relationship rather than a biological one.

<text>The &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise revolves around 1,025 fictional species of collectable monsters, each having unique designs, skills, and powers. Conceived by Satoshi Tajiri in early 1989, Pokémon (or Pocket Monsters) are fictional creatures that inhabit the fictional Pokémon World. The designs for the multitude of species can draw inspiration from anything such as animals, plants, and mythological creatures. Many Pokémon are capable of evolving into more powerful species, while others can undergo form changes and achieve similar results. Originally, only a handful of artists led by Ken Sugimori designed Pokémon. However, by 2013 a team of 20 artists worked together to create new species designs. Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida lead the team and determine the final designs.

The vast array of creatures is commonly divided into &quot;generations&quot;, with each division primarily encompassing new titles in the main video game series and often a change of handheld platform. Generation I with 151 Pokémon refers to &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot;; generation II with 100 Pokémon refers to &quot;Gold&quot;, &quot;Silver&quot;, and &quot;Crystal&quot;; generation III with 135 Pokémon refers to &quot;Ruby&quot;, &quot;Sapphire&quot;, &quot;FireRed&quot;, &quot;LeafGreen&quot;, and &quot;Emerald&quot;; generation IV with 107 Pokémon refers to &quot;Diamond&quot;, &quot;Pearl&quot;, &quot;Platinum&quot;, &quot;HeartGold&quot;, and &quot;SoulSilver&quot;; generation V with 156 Pokémon refers to &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;White&quot;, &quot;Black 2&quot;, and &quot;White 2&quot;; generation VI with 72 Pokémon refers to &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;Omega Ruby&quot;, and &quot;Alpha Sapphire&quot;; generation VII with 88 Pokémon refers to &quot;Sun&quot;, &quot;Moon&quot;, &quot;Ultra Sun&quot;, &quot;Ultra Moon&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Pikachu!&quot;, and &quot;Let&#x27;s Go, Eevee!&quot;; generation VIII with 96 Pokémon refers to &quot;Sword&quot;, &quot;Shield&quot;, &quot;Brilliant Diamond&quot;, &quot;Shining Pearl&quot;, and &quot;Legends: Arceus&quot;; and generation IX with 120 Pokémon refers to &quot;Scarlet&quot;, &quot;Violet&quot;, and &quot;Legends: Z-A&quot;.

Due to the large number of Pokémon, a listing of each species is divided into articles by generation. The 1025 Pokémon are organized by their number in the National Pokédex—an electronic encyclopedia that provides various information on Pokémon. The National Pokédex is subdivided into regional Pokédex series, each revolving around species introduced at the time of their respective generations along with older generations. For example, the Johto Pokédex, generation II, covers the 100 species introduced in &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; in addition to the original 151 species. The encyclopedias follow a general ordering: starter Pokémon are listed first, followed by species obtainable early in the respective games, and are concluded with Legendary and Mythical Pokémon. Generation V is the sole exception, as Victini is the first Pokémon in the Unova Pokédex.

==Concept==

Satoshi Tajiri—who later founded Game Freak—conceived the premise of &quot;Pokémon&quot; in general in 1989, when the Game Boy was released. The creatures that inhabit the world of &quot;Pokémon&quot; are also called Pokémon. The word &quot;Pokémon&quot; is a romanized contraction of the Japanese brand . The concept of the Pokémon universe, in both the video games and the general fictional world of Pokémon, stems most notably from Tajiri&#x27;s childhood hobby of insect collecting. Other influences on the concept include Ultraman, anime, and playing video games in general. Throughout his early life, Tajiri saw his rural, nature-filled hometown (Machida, Tokyo) transform into an urban centre. The urbanization of his town drove away wildlife, and he and others living in the area were eventually unable to collect insects. Through Pokémon, Tajiri sought to bring back this outdoor pastime and share it with the world. The first games in the franchise, &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;, were released on 27 February 1996 in Japan for the Game Boy. The games were internationally released as &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in September 1998. The ability to capture, battle, trade, and care for numerous creatures catapulted Pokémon to international popularity, and it has become a multibillion-dollar franchise and the second-best selling video game series after the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise.

At the start of a main series &quot;Pokémon&quot; game, the player character receives one of three &quot;starter&quot; Pokémon, with which they can battle and catch other Pokémon. Each Pokémon has one or two &quot;types&quot;, such as Fire, Water, or Grass. In battle, certain types are strong against other types. For example, a Fire-type attack will do more damage to a Grass-type Pokémon—rather than a Water-type attack. This form of gameplay is frequently compared to that of rock-paper-scissors, though players have to strategize which Pokémon and which of their attacks to use against various opponents.

Many species of Pokémon can evolve into a larger and more powerful creature. The change is accompanied by stat changes—generally a modest increase—and access to a wider variety of attacks. There are multiple ways to trigger an evolution, including reaching a particular level, using a special stone, or learning a specific attack. For example, at level 16, Bulbasaur can evolve into Ivysaur. Most notably, the Normal-type Eevee can evolve into eight different Pokémon: Jolteon (Electric), Flareon (Fire), Vaporeon (Water), Umbreon (Dark), Espeon (Psychic), Leafeon (Grass), Glaceon (Ice), and Sylveon (Fairy). In generation VI, the games introduced a new mechanic called Mega Evolution, as well as a subset of Mega Evolution called Primal Reversion. Unlike normal evolution, Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion last only for the duration of a battle, with the Pokémon reverting to its normal form at the end; as of the release of &quot;Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot;, 48 Pokémon can undergo Mega Evolution or Primal Reversion. In contrast, some species such as Castform, Rotom, Unown, and Lycanroc undergo form changes, which may provide stat buffs or changes and type alterations but are not considered new species. Some Pokémon have differences in appearance due to gender. Pokémon can be male or female, male-only, female-only, or of an unknown gender.

The &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise is primarily intended for younger players. However, each Pokémon has various complex attributes such as natures, characteristic traits, Individual Values (IVs) and Effort Values (EVs). These are intended for people &quot;who enjoy battling and want to go more in depth&quot;, according to Game Freak Board Director Junichi Masuda. These individual statistics were also included, because the basic concept of the franchise is to train one&#x27;s Pokémon. Designer Takeshi Kawachimaru stated that IVs and EVs &quot;help to make each Pokémon in the game individual&quot;, as it adds unique aspects to them. Each &quot;Pokémon&quot; game introduces a few &quot;Legendary&quot; and &quot;Mythical&quot; Pokémon that are powerful, rare, and hard to catch. &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot; introduced &quot;Ultra Beasts&quot;, which are described as &quot;beings from another dimension&quot; that appeared in the Alola region, and are similarly powerful and rare.

==Design and development==

Throughout development of &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot;, all Pokémon were designed by Ken Sugimori who was a long-time friend of Tajiri, and a team of fewer than ten people, including Atsuko Nishida who is credited as the designer of Pikachu. By 2013, a team of 20 artists worked together to create new species designs. A committee of five people determine which designs are incorporated into the games, with Sugimori and Hironobu Yoshida finalizing the look of each creature. Sugimori is also responsible for the &quot;Box Art&quot; Legendary Pokémon and all of the official artwork for the games. According to Yoshida, the number of rejected Pokémon designs is five to ten times more than the number that are finalized in each game. In rare cases, rejected designs are brought back and released in a later generation. Shigeru Ohmori, director of &quot;Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot;, admitted that creating new Pokémon has become a difficult task with the sheer number of creatures designed over the franchise&#x27;s 20-year history. Each iteration of the series has brought both praise and criticism over the numerous creatures.

The designs for Pokémon are often highly analogous to real-life creatures but also encompass inanimate objects. Director Junichi Masuda and graphic designer Takao Unno have stated that inspiration for Pokémon designs can come from anything. The variety of animals and culture around the world provide the basis for having countless ideas incorporated into the franchise. The environment that a Pokémon would live in is taken into account when they are designed. The lei-like Comfey fits appropriately in the Hawaii-inspired Alola region of &quot;Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot;. Masuda has stated that each element of a design has a functioning reason. In some cases, the design team creates a footprint that a Pokémon could make and designs a creature around that. Some designers look to game mechanics for inspiration and see where particular typing combinations could be interesting. Typing assignment varies during the design process; sometimes a Pokémon receives a type after it is created and other times they are designed around a particular type. Each Pokémon has a specific height and weight.

The simpler roots of designs in generation I prompted greater complexity in later games. Designs in general have become increasingly complex and thematic in newer games. Sneasel, for example, draws inspiration from the Japanese yōkai kamaitachi, mythical creatures with fast, razor-sharp claws that hunt in packs. These elements are all found in Sneasel&#x27;s design and characteristics. New Pokémon introduced in generation VI, for example, are heavily influenced by the culture and fauna of Europe (namely France). However, by the release of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; in 2013, Sugimori stated that he wishes for Pokémon design to return to the simpler roots of the franchise.

Masuda considers the starter Pokémon among the most important in the franchise. Yoshida goes further and calls them &quot;the face of that generation&quot; and says that &quot;they&#x27;re the ones that should be on the packaging&quot;. The three starter Pokémon of each generation are always Grass-, Water-, and Fire-types, a trio that Masuda considers the easiest to understand for new players. Their designs are based on recognizable animals and made to stand out from pre-existing Pokémon. Each are also given distinct personalities to further define them. In an interview with &quot;GamesRadar&quot; in 2009, Masuda stated that simple Pokémon take around six months to design and develop, and that Pokémon that play a more important part in the games (such as starter Pokémon) may take over a year. Masuda added, &quot;We also want the designer to have as much freedom as possible; we don&#x27;t want to narrow their imagination by saying, &#x27;We want this kind of Pokemon.&#x27; When we talk to the designer we always stress that they shouldn&#x27;t think of Pokemon necessarily, but should instead just be as creative as they can.&quot; After the Pokémon is designed, it is sent to the &quot;Battle Producer&quot;, who decides which moves and stats the Pokémon should have.

===Glitch species===
In the Game Boy &quot;Pokémon&quot; games, &quot;Pokémon Red&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Yellow&quot;, players were able to access a set of 105 glitch Pokémon. These species were not designed by the games&#x27; designers but could be encountered via the use of several glitches. Among them is a glitch dubbed MissingNo., which became highly notorious.

<text>Following the discovery of the planet Neptune in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. The search began in the mid-19th century and continued at the start of the 20th with Percival Lowell&#x27;s quest for Planet X. Lowell proposed the Planet X hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets, particularly Uranus and Neptune, speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities.

Clyde Tombaugh&#x27;s discovery of Pluto in 1930 appeared to validate Lowell&#x27;s hypothesis, and Pluto was officially named the ninth planet. In 1978, Pluto was conclusively determined to be too small for its gravity to affect the giant planets, resulting in a brief search for a tenth planet. The search was largely abandoned in the early 1990s, when a study of measurements made by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; spacecraft found that the irregularities observed in Uranus&#x27;s orbit were due to a slight overestimation of Neptune&#x27;s mass. After 1992, the discovery of numerous small icy objects with similar or even wider orbits than Pluto led to a debate over whether Pluto should remain a planet, or whether it and its neighbours should, like the asteroids, be given their own separate classification. Although a number of the larger members of this group were initially described as planets, in 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified Pluto and its largest neighbours as dwarf planets, leaving Neptune the farthest known planet in the Solar System.

While the astronomical community widely agrees that Planet X, as originally envisioned, does not exist, the concept of an as-yet-unobserved planet has been revived by a number of astronomers to explain other anomalies observed in the outer Solar System. As of March 2014, observations with the WISE telescope have ruled out the possibility of a Saturn-sized object (95 Earth masses) out to 10,000 AU, and a Jupiter-sized (≈318 Earth masses) or larger object out to 26,000 AU.

In 2014, based on similarities of the orbits of a group of recently discovered extreme trans-Neptunian objects, astronomers hypothesized the existence of a super-Earth or ice giant planet, 2 to 15 times the mass of the Earth and beyond 200 AU with possibly a highly inclined orbit at some 1,500 AU. In 2016, further work showed this unknown distant planet is likely to be on an inclined, eccentric orbit that goes no closer than about 200 AU and no farther than about 1,200 AU from the Sun. The orbit is predicted to be anti-aligned to the clustered extreme trans-Neptunian objects. Because Pluto is no longer considered a planet by the IAU, this new hypothetical object has become known as Planet Nine.

== Early speculation ==

In the 1840s, the French mathematician Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian mechanics to analyse perturbations in the orbit of Uranus, and hypothesised that they were caused by the gravitational pull of a yet-undiscovered planet. Le Verrier predicted the position of this new planet and sent his calculations to German astronomer Johann Gottfried Galle. On 23 September 1846, the night following his receipt of the letter, Galle and his student Heinrich d&#x27;Arrest discovered Neptune, exactly where Le Verrier had predicted. There remained some slight discrepancies in the giant planets&#x27; orbits. These were taken to indicate the existence of yet another planet orbiting beyond Neptune.

Even before Neptune&#x27;s discovery, some speculated that one planet alone was not enough to explain the discrepancy. On 17 November 1834, the British amateur astronomer the Reverend Thomas John Hussey reported a conversation he had had with French astronomer Alexis Bouvard to George Biddell Airy, the British Astronomer Royal. Hussey reported that when he suggested to Bouvard that the unusual motion of Uranus might be due to the gravitational influence of an undiscovered planet, Bouvard replied that the idea had occurred to him, and that he had corresponded with Peter Andreas Hansen, director of the Seeberg Observatory in Gotha, about the subject. Hansen&#x27;s opinion was that a single body could not adequately explain the motion of Uranus, and postulated that two planets lay beyond Uranus.

In 1848, Jacques Babinet raised an objection to Le Verrier&#x27;s calculations, claiming that Neptune&#x27;s observed mass was smaller and its orbit larger than Le Verrier had initially predicted. He postulated, based largely on simple subtraction from Le Verrier&#x27;s calculations, that another planet of roughly 12 Earth masses, which he named &quot;Hyperion&quot;, must exist beyond Neptune. Le Verrier denounced Babinet&#x27;s hypothesis, saying, &quot;[There is] absolutely nothing by which one could determine the position of another planet, barring hypotheses in which imagination played too large a part.&quot;

In 1850 James Ferguson, Assistant Astronomer at the United States Naval Observatory, noted that he had &quot;lost&quot; a star he had observed, GR1719k, which Lt. Matthew Maury, the superintendent of the Observatory, claimed was evidence that it must be a new planet. Subsequent searches failed to recover the &quot;planet&quot; in a different position, and in 1878, CHF Peters, director of the Hamilton College Observatory in New York, showed that the star had not in fact vanished, and that the previous results had been due to human error.

In 1879, Camille Flammarion noted that the comets 1862 III and 1889 III had aphelia of 47 and 49 AU, respectively, suggesting that they might mark the orbital radius of an unknown planet that had dragged them into an elliptical orbit. Astronomer George Forbes concluded on the basis of this evidence that two planets must exist beyond Neptune. He calculated, based on the fact that four comets possessed aphelia at around 100 AU and a further six with aphelia clustered at around 300 AU, the orbital elements of a pair of hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets. These elements accorded suggestively with those made independently by another astronomer named David Peck Todd, suggesting to many that they might be valid. However, sceptics argued that the orbits of the comets involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results. Some have considered Forbes&#x27;s hypothesis a precursor to Planet Nine.

In 1900 and 1901, Harvard College Observatory director William Henry Pickering led two searches for trans-Neptunian planets. The first was begun by Danish astronomer Hans Emil Lau who, after studying the data on the orbit of Uranus from 1690 to 1895, concluded that one trans-Neptunian planet alone could not account for the discrepancies in its orbit, and postulated the positions of two planets he believed were responsible. The second was launched when Gabriel Dallet suggested that a single trans-Neptunian planet lying at 47 AU could account for the motion of Uranus. Pickering agreed to examine plates for any suspected planets. In neither case were any found.

In 1902, after observing the orbits of comets with aphelia beyond Neptune, Theodor Grigull of Münster, Germany proclaimed the existence of a Uranus-sized planet at 50 AU with a 360-year period, which he named Hades, cross-checking with the deviations in the orbit of Uranus. In 1921, Grigull revised his orbital period to 310–330 years, to better fit the observed deviations.

In 1909, Thomas Jefferson Jackson See, an astronomer with a reputation as an egocentric contrarian, opined &quot;there is certainly one, most likely two and possibly three planets beyond Neptune&quot;. Tentatively naming the first planet &quot;Oceanus&quot;, he placed their respective distances at 42, 56 and 72 AU from the Sun. He gave no indication as to how he determined their existence, and no known searches were mounted to locate them.

In 1911, Indian astronomer Venkatesh P. Ketakar suggested the existence of two trans-Neptunian planets, which he named after the Hindu gods Brahma and Vishnu, by reworking the patterns observed by Pierre-Simon Laplace in the planetary satellites of Jupiter and applying them to the outer planets. The three inner Galilean moons of Jupiter, Io, Europa and Ganymede, are locked in a complicated 1:2:4 resonance called a Laplace resonance. Ketakar suggested that Uranus, Neptune and his hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets were also locked in Laplace-like resonances. This is incorrect; Uranus and Neptune, while in a near-2:1 resonance, are not in full resonance. His calculations predicted a mean distance for Brahma of 38.95 AU and an orbital period of 242.28 Earth years (3:4 resonance with Neptune). When Pluto was discovered 19 years later, its mean distance of 39.48 AU and orbital period of 248 Earth years were close to Ketakar&#x27;s prediction (Pluto in fact has a 2:3 resonance with Neptune). Ketakar made no predictions for the orbital elements other than mean distance and period. It is not clear how Ketakar arrived at these figures, and his second planet, Vishnu, was never located.

== Planet X ==

In 1894, with the help of William Pickering, Percival Lowell (a wealthy Bostonian) founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. In 1906, convinced he could resolve the conundrum of Uranus&#x27;s orbit, he began an extensive project to search for a trans-Neptunian planet, which he named &quot;Planet X&quot;, a name previously used by Gabriel Dallet. The &quot;X&quot; in the name represents an unknown and is pronounced as the letter, as opposed to the Roman numeral for 10 (at the time, Planet X would have been the ninth planet). Lowell&#x27;s hope in tracking down Planet X was to establish his scientific credibility, which had eluded him due to his widely derided belief that channel-like features visible on the surface of Mars were canals constructed by an intelligent civilization.

Lowell&#x27;s first search focused on the ecliptic, the plane encompassed by the zodiac where the other planets in the Solar System lie. Using a 5-inch photographic camera, he manually examined over 200 three-hour exposures with a magnifying glass, and found no planets. At that time Pluto was too far above the ecliptic to be imaged by the survey. After revising his predicted possible locations, Lowell conducted a second search from 1914 to 1916. In 1915, he published his &quot;Memoir of a Trans-Neptunian Planet&quot;, in which he concluded that Planet X had a mass roughly seven times that of Earth—about half that of Neptune—and a mean distance from the Sun of 43 AU. He assumed Planet X would be a large, low-density object with a high albedo, like the giant planets. As a result, it would show a disc with diameter of about one arcsecond and an apparent magnitude between 12 and 13—bright enough to be spotted.

Separately, in 1908, Pickering announced that, by analysing irregularities in Uranus&#x27;s orbit, he had found evidence for a ninth planet. His hypothetical planet, which he termed &quot;Planet O&quot; (because it came after &quot;N&quot;, i.e. Neptune), possessed a mean orbital radius of 51.9 AU and an orbital period of 373.5 years. Plates taken at his observatory in Arequipa, Peru, showed no evidence for the predicted planet, and British astronomer P. H. Cowell showed that the irregularities observed in Uranus&#x27;s orbit virtually disappeared once the planet&#x27;s displacement of longitude was taken into account. Lowell himself, despite his close association with Pickering, dismissed Planet O out of hand, saying, &quot;This planet is very properly designated &quot;O&quot;, [for it] is nothing at all.&quot; Unbeknownst to Pickering, four of the photographic plates taken in the search for &quot;Planet O&quot; by astronomers at the Mount Wilson Observatory in 1919 captured images of Pluto, though this was only recognised years later. Pickering went on to suggest many other possible trans-Neptunian planets up to the year 1932, which he named &quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, and &quot;U&quot;; none were ever detected.

=== Discovery of Pluto ===
Lowell&#x27;s sudden death in 1916 temporarily halted the search for Planet X. Failing to find the planet, according to one friend, &quot;virtually killed him&quot;. Lowell&#x27;s widow, Constance, engaged in a legal battle with the observatory over Lowell&#x27;s legacy which halted the search for Planet X for several years. In 1925, the observatory obtained glass discs for a new wide-field telescope to continue the search, constructed with funds from Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Percival&#x27;s brother. In 1929 the observatory&#x27;s director, Vesto Melvin Slipher, summarily handed the job of locating the planet to Clyde Tombaugh, a 22-year-old Kansas farm boy who had only just arrived at the Lowell Observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings.

Tombaugh&#x27;s task was to systematically capture sections of the night sky in pairs of images. Each image in a pair was taken two weeks apart. He then placed both images of each section in a machine called a blink comparator, which by exchanging images quickly created a time lapse illusion of the movement of any planetary body. To reduce the chances that a faster-moving (and thus closer) object be mistaken for the new planet, Tombaugh imaged each region near its opposition point, 180 degrees from the Sun, where the apparent retrograde motion for objects beyond Earth&#x27;s orbit is at its strongest. He also took a third image as a control to eliminate any false results caused by defects in an individual plate. Tombaugh decided to image the entire zodiac, rather than focus on those regions suggested by Lowell.
By the beginning of 1930, Tombaugh&#x27;s search had reached the constellation of Gemini. On 18 February 1930, after searching for nearly a year and examining nearly 2 million stars, Tombaugh discovered a moving object on photographic plates taken on 23 January and 29 January of that year. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 confirmed the movement. Upon confirmation, Tombaugh walked into Slipher&#x27;s office and declared, &quot;Doctor Slipher, I have found your Planet X.&quot; The object was just six degrees from one of two locations for Planet X Lowell had suggested; thus it seemed he had at last been vindicated. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930. The new object was later precovered on photographs dating back to 19 March 1915. The decision to name the object &quot;Pluto&quot; was intended in part to honour Percival Lowell, as his initials made up the word&#x27;s first two letters. After discovering Pluto, Tombaugh continued to search the ecliptic for other distant objects. He found hundreds of variable stars and asteroids, as well as two comets, but no further planets.

=== Pluto loses Planet X title ===

To the observatory&#x27;s disappointment and surprise, Pluto showed no visible disc; it appeared as a point, no different from a star, and, at only 15th magnitude, was six times dimmer than Lowell had predicted, which meant it was either very small, or very dark. Because of Lowell&#x27;s predictions, astronomers thought that Pluto would be massive enough to perturb planets. This led them to assume that its albedo could be no less than 0.07 (meaning that, at minimum, it would reflect 7% of the light that hit it), which would have made Pluto about as dark as asphalt, and similar in reflectivity to the least reflective planet, which is Mercury. This would have given Pluto an estimated mass of no more than 70% that of Earth. Observations also revealed that Pluto&#x27;s orbit was very elliptical, far more than that of any other planet.

Almost immediately, some astronomers questioned Pluto&#x27;s status as a planet. Barely a month after its discovery was announced, on April 14, 1930, in an article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Armin O. Leuschner suggested that Pluto&#x27;s dimness and high orbital eccentricity made it more similar to an asteroid or comet: &quot;The Lowell result confirms the possible high eccentricity announced by us on April 5. Among the possibilities are a large asteroid greatly disturbed in its orbit by close approach to a major planet such as Jupiter, or it may be one of many long-period planetary objects yet to be discovered, or a bright cometary object.&quot; In that same article, Harvard Observatory director Harlow Shapley wrote that Pluto was a &quot;member of the Solar System not comparable with known asteroids and comets, and perhaps of greater importance to cosmogony than would be another major planet beyond Neptune.&quot; In 1931, after examining the structure of the residuals of Uranus&#x27; longitude using a trigonometric formula, Ernest W. Brown asserted (in agreement with E. C. Bower) that the presumed irregularities in the orbit of Uranus could not be due to the gravitational effect of a more distant planet, and thus that Lowell&#x27;s supposed prediction was &quot;purely accidental&quot;.

Throughout the mid-20th century, estimates of Pluto&#x27;s mass were revised downward. In 1931, Nicholson and Mayall calculated its mass, based on its supposed effect on the giant planets, as roughly that of Earth; a value somewhat in accord with the 0.91 Earth mass calculated in 1942 by Lloyd R. Wylie at the US Naval Observatory, using the same assumptions. In 1949, Gerard Kuiper&#x27;s measurements of Pluto&#x27;s diameter with the 200-inch telescope at Mount Palomar Observatory led him to the conclusion that it was midway in size between Mercury and Mars and that its mass was most probably about 0.1 Earth mass.

In 1973, based on the similarities in the periodicity and amplitude of brightness variation with Triton, Dennis Rawlins conjectured Pluto&#x27;s mass must be similar to Triton&#x27;s. In retrospect, the conjecture turns out to have been correct; it had been argued by astronomers Walter Baade and E.C. Bower as early as 1934. However, because Triton&#x27;s mass was then believed to be roughly 2.5% of the Earth–Moon system (more than ten times its actual value), Rawlins&#x27;s determination for Pluto&#x27;s mass was similarly incorrect. It was nonetheless a meagre enough value for him to conclude Pluto was not Planet X. In 1976, Dale Cruikshank, Carl Pilcher, and David Morrison of the University of Hawaii analysed spectra from Pluto&#x27;s surface and determined that it must contain methane ice, which is highly reflective. This meant that Pluto, far from being dark, was in fact exceptionally bright, and thus was probably no more than  Earth mass.

Pluto&#x27;s size was finally determined conclusively in 1978, when American astronomer James W. Christy discovered its moon Charon. This enabled him, together with Robert Sutton Harrington of the U.S. Naval Observatory, to measure the mass of the Pluto–Charon system directly by observing the moon&#x27;s orbital motion around Pluto. They determined Pluto&#x27;s mass to be 1.31×1022 kg; roughly one five-hundredth that of Earth or one-sixth that of the Moon, and far too small to account for the observed discrepancies in the orbits of the outer planets. Lowell&#x27;s prediction had been a coincidence: If there was a Planet X, it was not Pluto.

=== Further searches for Planet X ===
After 1978, a number of astronomers kept up the search for Lowell&#x27;s Planet X, convinced that, because Pluto was no longer a viable candidate, an unseen tenth planet must have been perturbing the outer planets.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Robert Harrington led a search to determine the real cause of the apparent irregularities. He calculated that any Planet X would be at roughly three times the distance of Neptune from the Sun; its orbit would be highly eccentric, and strongly inclined to the ecliptic—the planet&#x27;s orbit would be at roughly a 32-degree angle from the orbital plane of the other known planets. This hypothesis was met with a mixed reception. Noted Planet X skeptic Brian G. Marsden of the Minor Planet Center pointed out that these discrepancies were a hundredth the size of those noticed by Le Verrier, and could easily be due to observational error.

In 1972, Joseph Brady of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory studied irregularities in the motion of Halley&#x27;s Comet. Brady claimed that they could have been caused by a Jupiter-sized planet beyond Neptune at 59 AU that is in a retrograde orbit around the Sun. However, both Marsden and Planet X proponent P. Kenneth Seidelmann attacked the hypothesis, showing that Halley&#x27;s Comet randomly and irregularly ejects jets of material, causing changes to its own orbital trajectory, and that such a massive object as Brady&#x27;s Planet X would have severely affected the orbits of known outer planets.

Although its mission did not involve a search for Planet X, the IRAS space observatory made headlines briefly in 1983 due to an &quot;unknown object&quot; that was at first described as &quot;possibly as large as the giant planet Jupiter and possibly so close to Earth that it would be part of this Solar System&quot;. Further analysis revealed that of several unidentified objects, nine were distant galaxies and the tenth was &quot;interstellar cirrus&quot;; none were found to be Solar System bodies.

In 1988, A. A. Jackson and R. M. Killen studied the stability of Pluto&#x27;s resonance with Neptune by placing test &quot;Planet X-es&quot; with various masses and at various distances from Pluto. Pluto and Neptune&#x27;s orbits are in a 3:2 resonance, which prevents their collision or even any close approaches, regardless of their separation in the z axis. It was found that the hypothetical object&#x27;s mass had to exceed 5 Earth masses to break the resonance, and the parameter space is quite large and a large variety of objects could have existed beyond Pluto without disturbing the resonance. Four test orbits of a trans-Plutonian planet have been integrated forward for four million years in order to determine the effects of such a body on the stability of the Neptune–Pluto 3:2 resonance. Planets beyond Pluto with masses of 0.1 and 1.0 Earth masses in orbits at 48.3 and 75.5 AU, respectively, do not disturb the 3:2 resonance. Test planets of 5 Earth masses with semi-major axes of 52.5 and 62.5 AU disrupt the four-million-year libration of Pluto&#x27;s argument of perihelion.

=== Planet X disproved ===
Harrington died in January 1993, without having found Planet X. Six months before, E. Myles Standish had used data from &quot;Voyager 2&quot;&#x27;s 1989 flyby of Neptune, which had revised the planet&#x27;s total mass downward by 0.5%—an amount comparable to the mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. When Neptune&#x27;s newly determined mass was used in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Developmental Ephemeris (JPL DE), the supposed discrepancies in the Uranian orbit, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished. There are no discrepancies in the trajectories of any space probes such as &quot;Pioneer 10&quot;, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot;, &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, and &quot;Voyager 2&quot; that can be attributed to the gravitational pull of a large undiscovered object in the outer Solar System. Today, most astronomers agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist.

== Discovery of further trans-Neptunian objects ==
After the discovery of Pluto and Charon, no more trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) were found until 15760 Albion in 1992. Since then, thousands of such objects have been discovered. Most are now recognized as part of the Kuiper belt, a swarm of icy bodies left over from the Solar System&#x27;s formation that orbit near the ecliptic plane just beyond Neptune. Though none were as large as Pluto, some of these distant trans-Neptunian objects, such as Sedna, were initially described in the media as &quot;new planets&quot;.

In 2005, astronomer Mike Brown and his team announced the discovery of (later named after the Greek goddess of discord and strife), a trans-Neptunian object then thought to be just barely larger than Pluto. Soon afterwards, a NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory press release described the object as the &quot;tenth planet&quot;.

Eris was never officially classified as a planet, and the 2006 definition of planet defined both Eris and Pluto not as planets but as dwarf planets because they have not cleared their neighbourhoods. They do not orbit the Sun alone, but as part of a population of similarly sized objects. Pluto itself is now recognized as being a member of the Kuiper belt and the largest dwarf planet, larger than the more massive Eris.

A number of astronomers, most notably Alan Stern, the head of NASA&#x27;s &quot;New Horizons&quot; mission to Pluto, contend that the IAU&#x27;s definition is flawed, and that Pluto and Eris, and all large trans-Neptunian objects, such as , , , and , should be considered planets in their own right. However, the discovery of Eris did not rehabilitate the Planet X theory because it is far too small to have significant effects on the outer planets&#x27; orbits.

== Subsequently proposed trans-Neptunian planets ==
Although most astronomers accept that Lowell&#x27;s Planet X does not exist, a number have revived the idea that a large unseen planet could create observable gravitational effects in the outer Solar System. These hypothetical objects are often referred to as &quot;Planet X&quot;, although the conception of these objects may differ considerably from that proposed by Lowell.

===Orbits of distant objects===

====Sedna&#x27;s orbit====

When Sedna was discovered, its extreme orbit raised questions about its origin. Its perihelion is so distant (approximately ) that no currently observed mechanism can explain Sedna&#x27;s eccentric distant orbit. It is too far from the planets to have been affected by the gravity of Neptune or the other giant planets and too bound to the Sun to be affected by outside forces such as the galactic tides. Hypotheses to explain its orbit include that it was affected by a passing star, that it was captured from another planetary system, or that it was tugged into its current position by a trans-Neptunian planet. The most obvious solution to determining Sedna&#x27;s peculiar orbit would be to locate a number of objects in a similar region, whose various orbital configurations would provide an indication as to their history. If Sedna had been pulled into its orbit by a trans-Neptunian planet, any other objects found in its region would have a similar perihelion to Sedna (around ).

====Excitement of Kuiper belt orbits====
In 2008, Tadashi Mukai and Patryk Sofia Lykawka suggested a distant Mars- or Earth-sized planet, currently in a highly eccentric orbit between 100 and and orbital period of 1000 years with an inclination of 20° to 40°, was responsible for the structure of the Kuiper belt. They proposed that the perturbations of this planet excited the eccentricities and inclinations of the trans-Neptunian objects, truncated the planetesimal disk at 48 AU, and detached the orbits of objects like Sedna from Neptune. During Neptune&#x27;s migration this planet is posited to have been captured in an outer resonance of Neptune and to have evolved into a higher perihelion orbit due to the Kozai mechanism leaving the remaining trans-Neptunian objects on stable orbits.

====Elongated orbits of group of Kuiper belt objects====
In 2012, Rodney Gomes modelled the orbits of 92 Kuiper belt objects and found that six of those orbits were far more elongated than the model predicted. He concluded that the simplest explanation was the gravitational pull of a distant planetary companion, such as a Neptune-sized object at 1,500 AU. This Neptune-sized object would cause the perihelia of objects with semi-major axes greater than 300 AU to oscillate, delivering them into planet-crossing orbits like those of and or detached orbits like Sedna&#x27;s.

====Planet Nine====

In 2014, astronomers announced the discovery of , a large object with a Sedna-like 4,200-year orbit and a perihelion of roughly 80 AU, which led them to suggest that it offered evidence of a potential trans-Neptunian planet. Trujillo and Sheppard argued that the orbital clustering of arguments of perihelia for and other extremely distant TNOs suggests the existence of a &quot;super-Earth&quot; of between 2 and 15 Earth masses beyond 200 AU and possibly on an inclined orbit at 1,500 AU.

In 2014 astronomers at the Universidad Complutense in Madrid suggested that the available data actually indicates more than one trans-Neptunian planet; subsequent work further suggests that the evidence is robust enough but rather than connected with the longitudes of the ascending nodes and the arguments of perihelia, semi-major axes and nodal distances could be the signposts. Additional work based on improved orbits of 39 objects still indicates that more than one perturber could be present and that one of them could orbit the Sun at 300-400 AU.

On January 20, 2016, Brown and Konstantin Batygin published an article corroborating Trujillo and Sheppard&#x27;s initial findings; proposing a super-Earth (dubbed Planet Nine) based on a statistical clustering of the arguments of perihelia (noted before) near zero and also ascending nodes near 113° of six distant trans-Neptunian objects. They estimated it to be ten times the mass of Earth (about 60% the mass of Neptune) with a semimajor axis of approximately 400–1500 AU.

===Probability===

Even without gravitational evidence, Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna, has argued that Sedna&#x27;s 12,000-year orbit means that probability alone suggests that an Earth-sized object exists beyond Neptune. Sedna&#x27;s orbit is so eccentric that it spends only a small fraction of its orbital period near the Sun, where it can be easily observed. This means that unless its discovery was a freak accident, there is probably a substantial population of objects roughly Sedna&#x27;s diameter yet to be observed in its orbital region. Mike Brown noted that
However, Brown notes that even though it might approach or exceed Earth in size, should such an object be found it would still be a &quot;dwarf planet&quot; by the current definition, because it would not have cleared its neighbourhood sufficiently.

===Kuiper cliff and &quot;Planet Ten&quot;===
Additionally, speculation of a possible trans-Neptunian planet has revolved around the so-called &quot;Kuiper cliff&quot;. The Kuiper belt terminates suddenly at a distance of from the Sun. Brunini and Melita have speculated that this sudden drop-off may be attributed to the presence of an object with a mass between those of Mars and Earth located beyond 48 AU.

The presence of an object with a mass similar to that of Mars in a circular orbit at leads to a trans-Neptunian object population incompatible with observations. For instance, it would severely deplete the plutino population. Astronomers have not excluded the possibility of an object with a mass similar to that of Earth located farther than with an eccentric and inclined orbit. Computer simulations by Patryk Lykawka of Kobe University have suggested that an object with a mass between , ejected outward by Neptune early in the Solar System&#x27;s formation and currently in an elongated orbit between from the Sun, could explain the Kuiper cliff and the peculiar detached objects such as Sedna and .

Although some astronomers, such as Renu Malhotra and David Jewitt, have cautiously supported these claims, others, such as Alessandro Morbidelli, have dismissed them as &quot;contrived&quot;. Malhotra &amp; Volk (2017) argued that an unexpected variance in inclination for KBOs farther than the cliff at provided evidence of a possible Mars-sized planet, possibly up to , residing at the edge of the Solar System, which many news sources began referring to as &quot;Planet Ten&quot;. Shortly after it was proposed, Lorenzo Iorio showed that the hypothetical planet&#x27;s existence cannot be ruled out by Cassini ranging data.

Starting in 2018, several surveys have discovered multiple objects located beyond the Kuiper Cliff. Some of these new discoveries are close to the heliopause (120 AU) or well beyond it (, , , ). An analysis of the TNO data available prior to September 2023 shows that there is a gap at about 72 AU, far from any mean-motion resonances with Neptune. Such a gap may have been induced by a massive perturber located further away.

===Other proposed planets===
Tyche was a hypothetical gas giant proposed to be located in the Solar System&#x27;s Oort cloud. It was first proposed in 1999 by astrophysicists John Matese, Patrick Whitman and Daniel Whitmire of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. They argued that evidence of Tyche&#x27;s existence could be seen in a supposed bias in the points of origin for long-period comets. In 2013, Matese and Whitmire re-evaluated the comet data and noted that Tyche, if it existed, would be detectable in the archive of data that was collected by NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) telescope. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object with Tyche&#x27;s characteristics, indicating that Tyche as hypothesized by Matese, Whitman, and Whitmire does not exist.

Conversely, in 1999, British astronomer John Murray theorized the existence of a Jupiter-sized planet similar to Tyche 32,000 astronomical units away from the Sun in a retrograde orbit. Murray estimates that the planet would be located in the constellation of Delphinus. These parameters, also based on the orbits of various long-period comets, are different from those originally hypothesized by Matese, Whitman, and Whitmire for Tyche, and hence signify a different object. Unlike Tyche, this putative planet lies outside the 26,000 AU limit set by mid-infrared observations by the &quot;WISE&quot; telescope, but this limit can be as high as 82,000 AU based on albedo. A brown dwarf, for instance, would have a smaller albedo than a Jupiter analog.

The oligarch theory of planet formation states that there were hundreds of planet-sized objects, known as oligarchs, in the early stages of the Solar System&#x27;s evolution. In 2005, astronomer Eugene Chiang speculated that although some of these oligarchs became the planets we know today, most would have been flung outward by gravitational interactions. Some may have escaped the Solar System altogether to become free-floating planets, whereas others would be orbiting in a halo around the Solar System, with orbital periods of millions of years. This halo would lie at between from the Sun, or between a third and a thirtieth the distance to the Oort cloud.

In December 2015, astronomers at the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) detected a brief series of 350 GHz pulses that they concluded must either be a series of independent sources, or a single, fast moving source. Deciding that the latter was the most likely, they calculated based on its speed that, were it bound to the Sun, the object, which they named &quot;Gna&quot; after a fast-moving messenger goddess in Norse mythology, would be about 12–25 AU distant and have a dwarf planet-sized diameter of 220 to 880 km. However, if it were a rogue planet not gravitationally bound to the Sun, and as far away as 4000 AU, it could be much larger. The paper was never formally accepted, and has been withdrawn until the detection is confirmed. Scientists&#x27; reactions to the notice were largely sceptical; Mike Brown commented that, &quot;If it is true that ALMA accidentally discovered a massive outer Solar System object in its tiny, tiny, tiny, field of view, that would suggest that there are something like 200,000 Earth-sized planets in the outer Solar System ... Even better, I just realized that this many Earth-sized planets existing would destabilize the entire Solar System and we would all die.&quot;

==Constraints on additional planets==
As of 2023 the following observations severely constrain the mass and distance of any possible additional Solar System planet:
* An analysis of mid-infrared observations with the &quot;WISE&quot; telescope have ruled out the possibility of a Saturn-sized object (95 Earth masses) out to 10,000 AU, and a Jupiter-sized or larger object out to 26,000 AU. &quot;WISE&quot; has continued to take more data since then, and NASA has invited the public to help search this data for evidence of planets beyond these limits, via the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 citizen science project.
* Using modern data on the anomalous precession of the perihelia of Saturn, Earth, and Mars, Lorenzo Iorio concluded that any unknown planet with a mass of 0.7 times that of Earth must be farther than 350–400 AU; one with a mass of 2 times that of Earth, farther than 496–570 AU; and finally one with a mass of 15 times that of Earth, farther than 970–1,111 AU. Moreover, Iorio stated that the modern ephemerides of the Solar System outer planets has provided even tighter constraints: no celestial body with a mass of 15 times that of Earth can exist closer than 1,100–1,300 AU. However, work by another group of astronomers using a more comprehensive model of the Solar System found that Iorio&#x27;s conclusion was only partially correct. Their analysis of &quot;Cassini&quot; data on Saturn&#x27;s orbital residuals found that observations were inconsistent with a planetary body with the orbit and mass similar to those of Batygin and Brown&#x27;s Planet Nine having a true anomaly of −130° to −110°, or −65° to 85°. Furthermore, the analysis found that Saturn&#x27;s orbit is slightly better explained if such a body is located at a true anomaly of . At this location, it would be approximately 630 AU from the Sun.
* Using public data on the orbits of the extreme trans-Neptunian objects, it has been confirmed that a statistically significant (62σ) asymmetry between the shortest mutual ascending and descending nodal distances does exist; in addition, multiple highly improbably (p &lt; 0.0002) correlated pairs of orbits with mutual nodal distances as low as 0.2 AU at 152 AU from the Solar System&#x27;s barycentre or 1.3 AU at 339 AU have been found. Both findings suggest that massive perturbers may exist at hundreds of AUs from the Sun and are difficult to explain within the context of a uniform distribution of orbital orientations in the outermost Solar System.

<text>In astronomy, the plutinos are a dynamical group of trans-Neptunian objects that orbit in 2:3 mean-motion resonance with Neptune. This means that for every two orbits a plutino makes, Neptune orbits three times. The dwarf planet Pluto is the largest member as well as the namesake of this group. The next largest members are , , and . Plutinos are named after mythological creatures associated with the underworld.

Plutinos form the inner part of the Kuiper belt and represent about a quarter of the known Kuiper belt objects. They are also the most populous known class of resonant trans-Neptunian objects &quot;(also see adjunct box with hierarchical listing)&quot;. The first plutino after Pluto itself, (385185) 1993 RO, was discovered on September 16, 1993.

== Orbits ==
=== Origin ===
It is thought that the objects that are currently in mean orbital resonances with Neptune initially followed a variety of independent heliocentric paths. As Neptune migrated outward early in the Solar System&#x27;s history (see origins of the Kuiper belt), the bodies it approached would have been scattered; during this process, some of them would have been captured into resonances. The 3:2 resonance is a low-order resonance and is thus the strongest and most stable among all resonances. This is the primary reason it has a larger population than the other Neptunian resonances encountered in the Kuiper Belt. The cloud of low-inclination bodies beyond 40 AU is the cubewano family, while bodies with higher eccentricities (0.05 to 0.34) and semimajor axes close to the 3:2 Neptune resonance are primarily plutinos.

=== Orbital characteristics ===

While the majority of plutinos have relatively low orbital inclinations, a significant fraction of these objects follow orbits similar to that of Pluto, with inclinations in the 10–25° range and eccentricities around 0.2–0.25; such orbits result in many of these objects having perihelia close to or even inside Neptune&#x27;s orbit, while simultaneously having aphelia that bring them close to the main Kuiper belt&#x27;s outer edge (where objects in a 1:2 resonance with Neptune, the Twotinos, are found).

The orbital periods of plutinos cluster around 247.3 years (1.5 × Neptune&#x27;s orbital period), varying by at most a few years from this value.

Unusual plutinos include:
* , which follows the most highly inclined orbit (34.5°)
*, which has the most elliptical orbit (its eccentricity is 0.33), with the perihelion halfway between Uranus and Neptune
* following a quasi-circular orbit
*  lying almost perfectly on the ecliptic (inclination less than 1.5°)
*15810 Arawn, a quasi-satellite of Pluto

See also the comparison with the distribution of the cubewanos.

=== Long-term stability ===
Pluto&#x27;s influence on the other plutinos has historically been neglected due to its relatively small mass. However, the resonance width (the range of semi-axes compatible with the resonance) is very narrow and only a few times larger than Pluto&#x27;s Hill sphere (gravitational influence). Consequently, depending on the original eccentricity, some plutinos will eventually be driven out of the resonance by interactions with Pluto. Numerical simulations suggest that the orbits of plutinos with an eccentricity 10%–30% smaller or larger than that of Pluto are not stable over Ga timescales.

<text>Prague ( ; ) is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic and the historical capital of Bohemia. Situated on the Vltava river, Prague is home to about 1.4 million people.

Prague is a political, cultural, and economic hub of Central Europe, with a rich history and Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance and Baroque architecture. It was the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia and residence of several Holy Roman Emperors, most notably Charles IV (r. 1346–1378) and Rudolf II (r. 1575–1611). It was an important city to the Habsburg monarchy and Austria-Hungary. The city played major roles in the Bohemian and the Protestant Reformations, the Thirty Years&#x27; War and in 20th-century history as the capital of Czechoslovakia between the World Wars and the post-war Communist era.

Prague is home to a number of cultural attractions including Prague Castle, Charles Bridge, Old Town Square with the Prague astronomical clock, the Jewish Quarter, Petřín hill and Vyšehrad. Since 1992, the historic center of Prague has been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.

The city has more than ten major museums, along with numerous theatres, galleries, cinemas, and other historical exhibits. An extensive modern public transportation system connects the city. It is home to a wide range of public and private schools, including Charles University in Prague, the oldest university in Central Europe.

Prague is classified as an &quot;Beta+&quot; global city according to GaWC studies. In 2019, the PICSA Index ranked the city as 13th most livable city in the world. Its rich history makes it a popular tourist destination and as of 2017, the city receives more than 8.5 million international visitors annually. In 2017, Prague was listed as the fifth most visited European city after London, Paris, Rome, and Istanbul.

==Etymology and names==
The Czech name Praha is derived from an old Slavic word, , which means &quot;ford&quot; or &quot;rapid&quot;, referring to the city&#x27;s origin at a crossing point of the Vltava river.

Another view to the origin of the name is also related to the Czech word (with the meaning of a threshold) and a legendary etymology connects the name of the city with princess Libuše, prophetess and a wife of the mythical founder of the Přemyslid dynasty. She is said to have ordered the city &quot;to be built where a man hews a threshold of his house&quot;. The Czech might thus be understood to refer to rapids or fords in the river, the edge of which could have acted as a means of fording the river – thus providing a &quot;threshold&quot; to the castle.

Another derivation of the name &quot;Praha&quot; is suggested from &quot;na prazě&quot;, the original term for the shale hillside rock upon which the original castle was built. At that time, the castle was surrounded by forests, covering the nine hills of the future city – the Old Town on the opposite side of the river, as well as the Lesser Town beneath the existing castle, appeared only later.

The English spelling of the city&#x27;s name is borrowed from French. In the 19th and early 20th centuries it was pronounced in English to rhyme with &quot;vague&quot;: it was so pronounced by Lady Diana Cooper (born 1892) on Desert Island Discs in 1969, and it is written to rhyme with &quot;vague&quot; in a verse of The Beleaguered City by Longfellow (1839) and also in the limerick There was an Old Lady of Prague by Edward Lear (1846).

Prague is also called the &quot;City of a Hundred Spires&quot;, based on a count by 19th century mathematician Bernard Bolzano; today&#x27;s count is estimated by the Prague Information Service at 500. Nicknames for Prague have also included: the Golden City, the Mother of Cities and the Heart of Europe.

The local Jewish community, which belongs to one of the oldest continuously existing in the world, have described the city as &quot;Ir va-em be-yisrael&quot;, &quot;The city and mother in Israel&quot;.

==History==
Prague has grown from a settlement stretching from Prague Castle in the north to the fort of Vyšehrad in the south, to become the capital of a modern European country.

===Early history===

The region was settled as early as the Paleolithic age. Jewish chronicler David Solomon Ganz, citing Cyriacus Spangenberg, claimed that the city was founded as Boihaem in BC by an ancient king, Boyya.

Around the fifth and fourth century BC, a Celtic tribe appeared in the area, later establishing settlements, including the largest Celtic oppidum in Bohemia, Závist, in a present-day south suburb Zbraslav in Prague, and naming the region of Bohemia, which means &quot;home of the Boii people&quot;. In the last century BC, the Celts were slowly driven away by Germanic tribes (Marcomanni, Quadi, Lombards and possibly the Suebi), leading some to place the seat of the Marcomanni king, Maroboduus, in Závist. Around the area where present-day Prague stands, the 2nd century map drawn by Roman geographer Ptolemaios mentioned a Germanic city called &quot;Casurgis&quot;.

In the late 5th century AD, during the great Migration Period following the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes living in Bohemia moved westwards and, probably in the 6th century, the Slavic tribes settled the Central Bohemian Region. In the following three centuries, the Czech tribes built several fortified settlements in the area, most notably in the Šárka valley, Butovice and Levý Hradec.
The construction of what came to be known as Prague Castle began near the end of the 9th century, expanding a fortified settlement that had existed on the site since the year 800. The first masonry under Prague Castle dates from the year 885 at the latest. The other prominent Prague fort, the Přemyslid fort Vyšehrad, was founded in the 10th century, some 70 years later than Prague Castle. Prague Castle is dominated by the cathedral, which began construction in 1344, but was not completed until the 20th century.

The legendary origins of Prague attribute its foundation to the 8th-century Czech duchess and prophetess Libuše and her husband, Přemysl, founder of the Přemyslid dynasty. Legend says that Libuše came out on a rocky cliff high above the Vltava and prophesied: &quot;I see a great city whose glory will touch the stars&quot;. She ordered a castle and a town called Praha to be built on the site.

The region became the seat of the dukes, and later kings of Bohemia. Under Duke of Bohemia Boleslaus II the Pious the area became a bishopric in 973. Until Prague was elevated to archbishopric in 1344, it was under the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Mainz.

Prague was an important seat for trading where merchants from across Europe settled, including many Jews, as recalled in 965 by the Hispano-Jewish merchant and traveler Abraham ben Jacob. The Old New Synagogue of 1270 still stands in the city. Prague was also once home to a slave market.

At the site of the ford in the Vltava river, King Vladislaus I had the first bridge built in 1170, the Judith Bridge (Juditin most), named in honor of his wife Judith of Thuringia. This bridge was destroyed by a flood in 1342, but some of the original foundation stones of that bridge remain in the river. It was rebuilt and named the Charles Bridge.

In 1257, under King Ottokar II, Malá Strana (&quot;Lesser Quarter&quot;) was founded in Prague on the site of an older village in what would become the Hradčany (Prague Castle) area. This was the district of the German people, who had the right to administer the law autonomously, pursuant to Magdeburg rights. The new district was on the bank opposite of the Staré Město (&quot;Old Town&quot;), which had borough status and was bordered by a line of walls and fortifications.

===Late Middle Ages===

Prague flourished during the 14th-century reign (1346–1378) of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor and the king of Bohemia of the new Luxembourg dynasty. As King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, he transformed Prague into an imperial capital. In the 1470s, Prague had around 70,000 inhabitants and with an area of 360 ha (~1.4 square miles) it was the third-largest city in the Holy Roman Empire.

Charles IV ordered the building of the New Town (Nové Město) adjacent to the Old Town and laid out the design himself. The Charles Bridge, replacing the Judith Bridge destroyed in the flood just prior to his reign, was erected to connect the east bank districts to the Malá Strana and castle area. In 1347, he founded Charles University, the oldest university in Central Europe.

His father John of Bohemia began construction of the Gothic Saint Vitus Cathedral, within the largest of the Prague Castle courtyards, on the site of the Romanesque rotunda there. Prague was elevated to an archbishopric in 1344, the year the cathedral was begun.

The city had a mint and was a center of trade for German and Italian bankers and merchants. The social order, however, became more turbulent due to the rising power of the craftsmen&#x27;s guilds (themselves often torn by internal conflicts), and the increasing number of poor.

The Hunger Wall, a substantial fortification wall south of Malá Strana and the castle area was built during a famine in the 1360s. The work is reputed to have been ordered by Charles IV as a means of providing employment and food to the workers and their families.

Charles IV died in 1378. During the reign of his son, King Wenceslaus IV (1378–1419), a period of intense turmoil ensued. During Easter 1389, members of the Prague clergy announced that Jews had desecrated the host (Eucharistic wafer) and the clergy encouraged mobs to pillage, ransack and burn the Jewish quarter. Nearly the entire Jewish population of Prague (ca 750 people) was murdered.

Jan Hus, a theologian and rector at Charles University, preached in Prague. In 1402, he began giving sermons in the Bethlehem Chapel. Inspired by John Wycliffe, these sermons focused on what were seen as radical reforms of a corrupt Church. Having become too dangerous for the political and religious establishment, Hus was summoned to the Council of Constance, put on trial for heresy, and burned at the stake in Konstanz in 1415.

Four years later Prague experienced its first defenestration, when the people rebelled under the command of the Prague priest Jan Želivský. Hus&#x27; death, coupled with Czech proto-nationalism and proto-Protestantism, had spurred the Hussite Wars. Peasant rebels, led by the general Jan Žižka, along with Hussite troops from Prague, defeated Emperor Sigismund, in the Battle of Vítkov Hill in 1420.

During the Hussite Wars when Prague was attacked by &quot;Crusader&quot; and mercenary forces, the city militia fought bravely under the Prague Banner. This swallow-tailed banner is approximately , with a red field sprinkled with small white fleurs-de-lis, and a silver old Town Coat-of-Arms in the center. The words &quot;PÁN BŮH POMOC NAŠE&quot; (The Lord is our Relief/Help) appeared above the coat-of-arms, with a Hussite chalice centered on the top. Near the swallow-tails is a crescent-shaped golden sun with rays protruding.

One of these banners was captured by Swedish troops during the Battle of Prague (1648) when they captured the western bank of the Vltava river and were repulsed from the eastern bank, they placed it in the Royal Military Museum in Stockholm; although this flag still exists, it is in very poor condition. They also took the Codex Gigas and the Codex Argenteus. The earliest evidence indicates that a gonfalon with a municipal charge painted on it was used for the Old Town as early as 1419. Since this city militia flag was in use before 1477 and during the Hussite Wars, it is the oldest still preserved municipal flag of Bohemia.

In the following two centuries, Prague strengthened its role as a merchant city. Many noteworthy Gothic buildings were erected and Vladislav Hall of the Prague Castle was added.

===Habsburg era===

In 1526, the Bohemian estates elected Ferdinand I of the House of Habsburg. The fervent Catholicism of its members brought them into conflict in Bohemia, and then in Prague, where Protestant ideas were gaining popularity. These problems were not preeminent under Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II, elected King of Bohemia in 1576, who chose Prague as his home. He lived in Prague Castle, where his court welcomed not only astrologers and magicians but also scientists, musicians, and artists. Rudolf was an art lover as well, and Prague became the capital of European culture. This was a prosperous period for the city: famous people living there in that age include the astronomers Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler, the painter Arcimboldo, the alchemists Edward Kelley and John Dee, the poet Elizabeth Jane Weston, and others.

In 1618, the famous second defenestration of Prague provoked the Thirty Years&#x27; War, a particularly harsh period for Prague and Bohemia. Ferdinand II of Habsburg was deposed, and his place as King of Bohemia taken by Frederick V, Elector Palatine; however his army was crushed in the Battle of White Mountain (1620) not far from the city. Following this in 1621 was an execution of 27 Czech Protestant leaders (involved in the uprising) in Old Town Square and the exiling of many others. Prague was forcibly converted back to Roman Catholicism followed by the rest of Czech lands. The city suffered subsequently during the war under an attack by Electorate of Saxony (1631) and during the Battle of Prague (1648). Prague began a steady decline which reduced the population from the 60,000 it had had in the years before the war to 20,000. In the second half of the 17th century, Prague&#x27;s population began to grow again. Jews had been in Prague since the end of the 10th century and, by 1708, they accounted for about a quarter of Prague&#x27;s population.

In 1689, a great fire devastated Prague, but this spurred a renovation and a rebuilding of the city. In 1713–14, a major outbreak of plague hit Prague one last time, killing 12,000 to 13,000 people.
In 1744, Frederick the Great of Prussia invaded Bohemia. He took Prague after a severe and prolonged siege in the course of which a large part of the town was destroyed. Empress Maria Theresa expelled the Jews from Prague in 1745; though she rescinded the expulsion in 1748, the proportion of Jewish residents in the city never recovered. In 1757 the Prussian bombardment destroyed more than one-quarter of the city and heavily damaged St. Vitus Cathedral. However, a month later, Frederick the Great was defeated and forced to retreat from Bohemia.

The economy of Prague continued to improve during the 18th century. The population increased to 80,000 inhabitants by 1771. Many rich merchants and nobles enhanced the city with a host of palaces, churches and gardens full of art and music, creating a Baroque city renowned throughout the world to this day.

In 1784, under Joseph II, the four municipalities of Malá Strana, Nové Město, Staré Město, and Hradčany were merged into a single entity. The Jewish district, called Josefov, was included only in 1850. The Industrial Revolution produced great changes and developments in Prague, as new factories could take advantage of the coal mines and ironworks of the nearby regions. The first suburb, Karlín, was created in 1817, and twenty years later the population exceeded 100,000.

The revolutions in Europe in 1848 also touched Prague, but they were fiercely suppressed. In the following years, the Czech National Revival began its rise, until it gained the majority in the town council in 1861. Prague had a large number of German speakers in 1848, but by 1880 the number of German speakers had decreased to 14% (42,000), and by 1910 to 6.7% (37,000), due to a massive increase in the city&#x27;s overall population caused by the influx of Czechs from the rest of Bohemia and Moravia and the increasing prestige and importance of the Czech language as part of the Czech National Revival. In 1891, the city council ordered that all German inscriptions be removed in Prague, while Czechs at the same time demanded equal status for the Czech and German languages in Bohemia and Moravia.

===20th century===
====First Czechoslovak Republic====

World War I ended with the defeat of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the creation of Czechoslovakia. Prague was chosen as its capital and Prague Castle as the seat of president Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. At this time Prague was a true European capital with highly developed industry. By 1930, the population had risen to 850,000.

====Second World War====
Hitler ordered the German Army to enter Prague on 15 March 1939, and from Prague Castle proclaimed Bohemia and Moravia a German protectorate. For most of its history, Prague had been a multi-ethnic city with important Czech, German and (mostly native German-speaking) Jewish populations. From 1939, when the country was occupied by Nazi Germany, Hitler took over Prague Castle. During the Second World War, most Jews were deported and killed by the Germans. In 1942, Prague was witness to the assassination of one of the most powerful men in Nazi Germany—Reinhard Heydrich—during Operation Anthropoid, accomplished by Czechoslovak national heroes Jozef Gabčík and Jan Kubiš. Hitler ordered bloody reprisals.

In February 1945, Prague suffered several bombing raids by the US Army Air Forces. 701 people were killed, more than 1,000 people were injured and some buildings, factories and historic landmarks (Emmaus Monastery, Faust House, Vinohrady Synagogue) were destroyed. Many historic structures in Prague, however, escaped the destruction of the war and the damage was small compared to the total destruction of many other cities in that time. According to American pilots, it was the result of a navigational mistake. In March, a deliberate raid targeted military factories in Prague, killing about 370 people.

On 5 May 1945, two days before Germany capitulated, an uprising against Germany occurred. Several thousand Czechs were killed in four days of bloody street fighting, with many atrocities committed by both sides. Fought concurrently with the Prague uprising, the Prague offensive significantly helped the liberation of Czechoslovakia. At daybreak on 9 May, the of the Red Army took the capital city almost unopposed. The majority (about 50,000 people) of the German population of Prague either fled or were expelled by the Beneš decrees in the aftermath of the war.

====Cold War====

Prague was a city in a country under the military, economic, and political control of the Soviet Union (see Iron Curtain and COMECON). The world&#x27;s largest Stalin Monument was unveiled on Letná hill in 1955 and destroyed in 1962.
The 4th Czechoslovak Writers&#x27; Congress, held in the city in June 1967, took a strong position against the regime. On 31 October 1967 students demonstrated at Strahov. This spurred the new secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, Alexander Dubček, to proclaim a new deal in his city&#x27;s and country&#x27;s life, starting the short-lived season of the &quot;socialism with a human face&quot;. It was the Prague Spring, which aimed at the renovation of political institutions in a democratic way. The other Warsaw Pact member countries, except Romania and Albania, were led by the Soviet Union to repress these reforms through the invasion of Czechoslovakia and the capital, Prague, on 21 August 1968. The invasion, chiefly by infantry and tanks, effectively suppressed any further attempts at reform. The military occupation of Czechoslovakia by the Red Army would end only in 1991. Jan Palach and Jan Zajíc committed suicide by self-immolation in January and February 1969 to protest against the &quot;normalization&quot; of the country.

===After the Velvet Revolution===

In 1989, after riot police beat back a peaceful student demonstration, the Velvet Revolution crowded the streets of Prague, and the capital of Czechoslovakia benefited greatly from the new mood. In 1992, the Historic Centre of Prague and its monuments were inscribed as a cultural UNESCO World Heritage Site. In 1993, after the Velvet Divorce, Prague became the capital city of the new Czech Republic. Since the 1990s, high-rise buildings began to be built in Prague in large quantities. In the late 1990s, Prague again became an important cultural center of Europe and was notably influenced by globalisation. In 2000, the IMF and World Bank summits took place in Prague and anti-globalization riots took place here. In 2002, Prague suffered from widespread floods that damaged buildings and its underground transport system.

Prague launched a bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics, but failed to make the candidate city shortlist. In June 2009, as the result of financial pressures from the global recession, Prague&#x27;s officials chose to cancel the city&#x27;s planned bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics.

On 21 December 2023, a mass shooting took place at Charles University in central Prague. In total, 15 people were killed and 25 injured. It was the deadliest mass murder in the history of the Czech Republic.

==Geography==
Prague is situated on the Vltava river. The Berounka flows into the Vltava in the suburbs of Lahovice. There are 99 watercourses in Prague with a total length of . The longest streams are Rokytka and Botič.

There are 3 reservoirs, 37 ponds, and 34 retention reservoirs and dry polders in the city. The largest pond is Velký Počernický with . The largest body of water is Hostivař Reservoir with .

In terms of geomorphological division, most of Prague is located in the Prague Plateau. In the south the city&#x27;s territory extends into the Hořovice Uplands, in the north it extends into the Central Elbe Table lowland. The highest point is the top of the hill Teleček on the western border of Prague, at above sea level. Notable hills in the centre of Prague are Petřín with and Vítkov with . The lowest point is the Vltava in Suchdol at the place where it leaves the city, at .

Prague is located approximately at . Prague is approximately at the same latitude as Frankfurt, Germany; Paris, France; and Vancouver, Canada. The northernmost point is at , the southernmost point is at , the westernmost point is at , and the easternmost point is at . Farthest geographical points of the city territory are marked physically by so called „Prague Poles&quot;.

===Climate===

Prague has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dobk&quot;) bordering on a humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;), defined as such by the isotherm. The winters are relatively cold with average temperatures at about freezing point (0 °C), and with very little sunshine. Snow cover can be common between mid-November and late March although snow accumulations of more than are infrequent. There are also a few periods of mild temperatures in winter. Summers usually bring plenty of sunshine and the average high temperature of . Nights can be quite cool even in summer, though. Precipitation in Prague is moderate ( per year) since it is located in the rain shadow of the Sudetes and other mountain ranges. The driest season is usually winter while late spring and summer can bring quite heavy rain, especially in the form of thundershowers. The number of hours of average sunshine has increased over time. Temperature inversions are relatively common between mid-October and mid-March bringing foggy, cold days and sometimes moderate air pollution. Prague is also a windy city with common sustained western winds and an average wind speed of that often helps break temperature inversions and clear the air in cold months. 


==Administration and politics==
===Administrative division===
Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic and as such is the regular seat of its central authorities. Since 24 November 1990, it is &quot;de facto&quot; again a statutory city, but has a specific status of the municipality and the region at the same time. Prague also houses the administrative institutions of the Central Bohemian Region.

Until 1949, all administrative districts of Prague were formed by the whole one or more cadastral unit, municipality or town. Since 1949, there has been a fundamental change in the administrative division. Since then, the boundaries of many urban districts, administrative districts and city districts are independent of the boundaries of cadastral territories and some cadastral territories are thus divided into administrative and self-governing parts of the city. Cadastral area (for example, Vinohrady and Smíchov) are still relevant especially for the registration of land and real estate and house numbering.

Prague is divided into 10 municipal districts (1–10), 22 administrative districts (1–22), 57 municipal parts, and 112 cadastral areas.
===City government===
Prague is administered by the autonomous Prague City Assembly, which consists of 65 members and is elected through municipal elections. As of Dec. 20, 18 members of the council were from the centre-right Together Prague group, which governs the city in conjunction with 12 members of the Pirates (centre to centre-left) and 5 members of the Mayors and Independents group (centre to centre-right). Thus, the governing coalition has a comfortable majority in the assembly with 35 of 65 seats. Opposition parties include ANO 2011 (right-wing populist) with 14 members, Prague Together (centre) with 11 votes, Freedom and Direct Democracy (right wing to far-right) with 3 members and, 2 unaffiliated Independents.

The executive body of Prague, elected by the Assembly, is Prague City Council. The municipal office of Prague is at Prague City Hall and has 11 members, including the mayor. It prepares proposals for the Assembly meetings and ensures that adopted resolutions are fulfilled. The Mayor of Prague is Civic Democratic Party member Bohuslav Svoboda.

==Demographics==
===2011 census===
Even though the official population of Prague hovers around 1.3 million as of the 2011 census, the city&#x27;s real population is much higher due to only 65% of its residents being marked as permanently living in the city. Data taken from mobile phone movements around the city suggest that the real population of Prague is closer to 1.9 or 2.0 million, with an additional 300,000 to 400,000 commuters coming to the city on weekdays for work, education, or commerce.

About 14% of the city&#x27;s inhabitants were born outside the Czech Republic, the highest proportion in the country. However, 64.8% of the city&#x27;s population self-identified as ethnically Czech, which is slightly higher than the national average of 63.7%. Almost 29% of respondents declined to answer the question on ethnicity at all, so it may be assumed that the real percentage of ethnic Czechs in Prague is considerably higher. The largest ethnic minority are Slovaks, followed by Ukrainians and Russians.

Prague&#x27;s population is the oldest and best-educated in the country. It has the lowest proportion of children. Only 10.8% of census respondents claimed adherence to a religion; the majority of these were Roman Catholics.

===Historical population===
Development of the Prague population since 1378 (since 1869 according to the censuses within the limits of present-day Prague):

==Economy==
Prague&#x27;s economy accounts for 25% of the Czech GDP making it the highest performing regional economy of the country. As of 2021, its GDP per capita in purchasing power standard is €58,216, making it the third best performing region in the EU at 203 per cent of the EU-27 average in 2021.

Prague employs almost a fifth of the entire Czech workforce, and its wages are significantly above average (≈+20%). In 4Q/2020, during the pandemic, average salaries available in Prague reached CZK 45.944 (≈€1,800) per month, an annual increase of 4%, which was nevertheless lower than national increase of 6.5% both in nominal and real terms. (Inflation in the Czech Republic was 3.2% in 4Q/2020.) Since 1990, the city&#x27;s economic structure has shifted from industrial to service-oriented. Industry is present in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, printing, food processing, manufacture of transport equipment, computer technology, and electrical engineering.

==Tourism==



Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, Prague has become one of the world&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations. Prague suffered considerably less damage during World War II than some other major cities in the region, allowing most of its historic architecture to stay true to form. It contains one of the world&#x27;s most pristine and varied collections of architecture, from Romanesque, to Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, Neo-Renaissance, Neo-Gothic, Art Nouveau, Cubist, Neo-Classical and ultra-modern.

Prague is classified as an &quot;Beta+&quot; global city according to GaWC studies, comparable to Vienna, Manila and Washington, D.C. Prague ranked sixth in the Tripadvisor world list of best destinations in 2016. Its rich history makes it a popular tourist destination, and the city receives more than 8.4 million international visitors annually, . Furthermore, the city was ranked 7th in the world ICCA Destination Performance Index measuring performance of conference tourism in 2021.

There are also three funiculars, the Petřín funicular on Petřín Hill, one on Mrázovka Hill and a third at the Zoo in Troja.

The Prague tram system now operates various types of trams, including the Tatra T3, newer Tatra KT8D5, Škoda 14 T (designed by Porsche), newer modern Škoda 15 T and nostalgic tram lines 23 and 41. Around 400 vehicles are the modernized T3 class, which are typically operated coupled together in pairs.

The Prague tram system is the twelfth longest in the world (144 km) and its rolling stock consists of 786 individual cars, which is the largest in the world. The system carries more than 360 million passengers annually, the highest tram patronage in the world after Budapest, on a per capita basis, Prague has the second highest tram patronage after Zürich.

All services (metro, tramways, city buses, funiculars and ferries) have a common ticketing system that operates on a proof-of-payment system.

A new interchange station for the bus in the direction of the airport is the station Nádraží Veleslavín. The final station of the green line is Nemocnice Motol (Motol Hospital), giving people direct public transportation access to the largest medical facility in the Czech Republic and one of the largest in Europe. A railway connection to the airport is planned.

In operation there are two kinds of units: &quot;81-71M&quot; which is modernized variant of the Soviet Metrovagonmash 81-71 (completely modernized between 1995 and 2003) and new &quot;Metro M1&quot; trains (since 2000), manufactured by consortium consisting of Siemens, ČKD Praha and ADtranz. The minimum interval between two trains is 90 seconds.

The original Soviet vehicles &quot;Ečs&quot; were excluded in 1997, but one vehicle is placed in public transport museum in depot Střešovice. The Náměstí Míru metro station is the deepest station and is equipped with the longest escalator in European Union. The Prague metro is generally considered very safe.

<doc id="23848" wikidata="Q149588" url="?curid=23848" title="Pomeranian language">
<text>The Pomeranian language ( or ; or ) is in the Pomeranian group of Lechitic languages (; ) within the West Slavic languages.

In medieval contexts, it refers to the dialects spoken by the Slavic Pomeranians. In modern contexts, the term is sometimes used synonymously with &quot;Kashubian&quot; and may also include extinct Slovincian.

The name &quot;Pomerania&quot; comes from Slavic , which means &quot;[land] by the sea&quot;.

== Ancient Pomeranian ==
During the early medieval Slavic migrations, the area between the Oder and Vistula rivers was settled by tribes grouped as Pomeranians. Their dialects, sometimes referred to as Ancient Pomeranian, had a transitory character between the Polabian dialects spoken west of Pomerania and the Old Polish dialects spoken to the southeast. The earliest text written in Pomerania comes from 1304, published in 1881-1882 in &quot;Pommerellisches Urkundenbuch&quot;.
== Slovincian and Kashubian ==

During the High Middle Ages, German immigration and assimilation of the Slavic Pomeranians () introduced Low German East Pomeranian, Central Pomeranian, and dialects, which became dominant in Pomerania except for some areas in the east, where the populace remained largely Slavic and continued to use the Slavic Pomeranian language. This was especially the case in Pomerelia, where the Slavic population became known as Kashubians and their language accordingly as Kashubian. An insular Slavic Pomeranian dialect spoken northwest of Kashubia until the 20th century became known as Slovincian. It is disputed whether Slovincian may be regarded as a dialect of Kashubian or a separate language. Likewise, it is disputed whether Kashubian may be regarded as a dialect of Polish or a separate language. Stefan Ramułt (1859–1913) was fascinated by Florian Ceynowa and decidedly supported giving Kashubian the status of a full-fledged standard language.

== Influence on other dialects ==
The Pomeranian language influenced the formation of other Polish language dialects, such as the Kociewski, Borowiacki and Krajniacki dialects. Undoubtedly, they belong to the Polish language, but they also have some features in common with the Pomeranian language, which proves their character was transitional.

Friedrich Lorentz supposed that the Kociewski and Borewiacki dialects first belonged to the Pomeranian language and were then Polonized as a result of the Polish colonization of these territories. According to Lorentz, the Krajniacki dialect most probably was originally a part of the Polish language.

The common feature of the Kociewski dialects and the Kashubian language is, for example, the partial preservation of the so-called &quot;TarT&quot; group and a part of its lexis. For the Borowiacki dialects and the Pomeranian language, the common feature was affrication of dorsal consonants.

The Pomeranian language also influenced the Low German dialects, which were used in Pomerania. After Germanisation, the population of Western Pomerania started to use the Low German dialects. Those dialects, though, were influenced by the Pomeranian language (Slavic). Most words originating from Pomeranian can be found in vocabulary connected with fishery and farming. The word / may serve as an example. It describes a kind of a fishing net and is still known in the Low German dialects of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern today. The word comes from the old Pomeranian word of the same meaning: . It moved to Kashubian and Slovincian dialects through Low German, and appeared in Pomeranian dictionaries as meaning &quot;flounder and perch fishing net&quot;. Thus, it is a &quot;reverse loan-word&quot; as the Pomeranian language borrowed the word from Low German in which it functioned as a &quot;Pomoranism&quot; (a borrowing from the Pomeranian language).

A borrowing from the Pomeranian language which has been used in everyday German language and has appeared in dictionaries is the phrase &quot;&quot; (it means: come on, come on). It moved to the German language through the German dialects of West Prussia, and is also present in the Kashubian language (spelled: ).

== Assessment ==

The classification of the Pomeranian ethnolect is problematic. It was classified by Aleksander Brückner as one of the Old Polish dialects. At the same time, he classified the extant Kashubian and Slovincian dialects as belonging to the Modern Polish language. Other linguists relate the Pomeranian language to the Polabian group of dialects (forming the Pomeranian-Polabian group).

After Slovincian and all the Pomeranian dialects (except Kashubian) became extinct, the Kashubian language is the term most often used in relation to the language spoken by the Pomeranians. However, it is still not clear from where the words &quot;Kashubians&quot; and &quot;Kashubian&quot; ( and , and ) originated and how they were brought from the area near Koszalin to Pomerelia. None of the theories proposed has been widely accepted so far. There is also no indication that Pomeranians wandered from the area of Koszalin to Pomerelia.

While Western Pomerania was being Germanized, the Germans (both colonizers and Germanized descendants of Slavic Pomeranians) started using the words &quot;Pomeranian&quot; (; ) and &quot;Pomeranians&quot; (; ) referring to their own population. The part of the Pomeranian population which kept their Slavic language was called the Wends () or the Kashubians (). As the West lost its Slavic character, those two terms were more often used in the East. In 1850, in the preface to his Kashubian-Russian dictionary, Florian Ceynowa wrote about the language of Baltic Slavic peoples: &quot;Usually it is called the &#x27;Kashubian language&#x27;, although the &#x27;Pomeranian-Slovenian dialect&#x27; would be a more proper term.&quot;

The word dialect was probably used by Ceynowa because he was a follower of Pan-Slavism, according to which all the Slavic languages were dialects of one Slavic language. In his later works, though, he called his language .

In 1893, Stefan Ramułt, the Jagiellonian University linguist, referred to the early history of Pomerania, publishing the &quot;Dictionary of the Pomoranian i.e. Kashubian Language&quot;. In the preface, Ramułt wrote:

: As Kashubians are the direct descendants of Pomeranians, it is right to use the words Pomeranian and Kashubian as synonyms. Especially as there are other reasons for it as well...

and

: Kashubians and Slavs are what remains of the once powerful Pomeranian tribe and they are the only inheritors of the name Pomeranians.

Friedrich Lorentz (the author of &quot;Pomeranian Grammar&quot; and &quot;The History of Pomeranian/Kashubian Language&quot;) referred in his works to Ramułt&#x27;s dictionary. After Lorentz died, Friedhelm Hinze published a Pomeranian dictionary in five volumes (), which was based on Lorentz&#x27;s writing.

=== The status of Kashubian today ===
The Pomeranian language, and its only surviving form, Kashubian, traditionally have not been recognized by the majority of Polish linguists, and have been treated in Poland as &quot;the most distinct dialect of Polish&quot;. However, there have also been some Polish linguists who treated Pomeranian as a separate language. The most prominent of them were Stefan Ramułt, and Alfred Majewicz, who overtly called Kashubian a language in the 1980s.

Following the collapse of communism in Poland, attitudes on the status of Kashubian have been gradually changing. It is increasingly seen as a fully-fledged language, as it is taught in state schools and has some limited usage on public radio and television. A bill passed by the Polish parliament in 2005 recognizes it as a regional language in the Republic of Poland and provides for its use in official contexts in 10 communes where its speakers constitute at least 20% of the population.

<text>The Peace of Westphalia (, ) is the collective name for two peace treaties signed in October 1648 in the Westphalian cities of Osnabrück and Münster. They ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) and brought peace to the Holy Roman Empire, closing a calamitous period of European history that killed approximately eight million people. Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III, the kingdoms of France and Sweden, and their respective allies among the princes of the Holy Roman Empire, participated in the treaties.

The negotiation process was lengthy and complex. Talks took place in two cities, because each side wanted to meet on territory under its own control. A total of 109 delegations arrived to represent the belligerent states, but not all delegations were present at the same time. Two treaties were signed to end the war in the Empire: the Treaty of Münster and the Treaty of Osnabrück. These treaties ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War in the Holy Roman Empire, with the Habsburgs (rulers of Austria and Spain) and their Catholic allies on one side, battling the Protestant powers (Sweden and certain Holy Roman principalities) allied with France (though Catholic, strongly anti-Habsburg under King Louis XIV).

Several scholars of international relations have identified the Peace of Westphalia as the origin of principles crucial to modern international relations, collectively known as Westphalian sovereignty. However, some historians have argued against this, suggesting that such views emerged during the nineteenth and twentieth century in relation to concerns about sovereignty during that time.

== Background ==

Europe had been battered by both the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the overlapping Eighty Years&#x27; War (begun c. 1568), exacting a heavy toll in money and lives. The Eighty Years&#x27; War was a prolonged struggle for the independence of the Protestant-majority Dutch Republic (the modern Netherlands), supported by Protestant-majority England, against Catholic-dominated Spain and Portugal. The Thirty Years&#x27; War was the most deadly of the European wars of religion, centred on the Holy Roman Empire. The war, which developed into four phases, included a large number of domestic and foreign players, siding either with the Catholic League or the Protestant Union (later Heilbronn League). The Peace of Prague (1635) ended most religious aspects of the war, and the French–Habsburg rivalry took over prominence. With between 4.5 million and 8 million dead in the Thirty Years&#x27; War alone, and decades of constant warfare, the need for peace became increasingly clear.

==Locations==

Peace negotiations between France and the Habsburg Emperor began in Cologne in 1636. These negotiations were initially blocked by Cardinal Richelieu of France, who insisted on the inclusion of all his allies, whether fully sovereign countries or states within the Holy Roman Empire. In Hamburg, Sweden, France, and the Holy Roman Empire negotiated a preliminary peace in December 1641. They declared that the preparations of Cologne and the Treaty of Hamburg were preliminaries of an overall peace agreement.

The main peace negotiations took place in Westphalia, in the neighbouring cities of Münster and Osnabrück. Both cities were maintained as neutral and demilitarized zones for the negotiations.

In Münster, negotiations took place between the Holy Roman Empire and France, as well as between the Dutch Republic and Spain who on 30 January 1648 signed a peace treaty ending the Eighty Years&#x27; War that was not part of the Peace of Westphalia. Münster had been, since its re-Catholicism in 1535, a strictly mono-denominational community. It housed the Chapter of the Prince-Bishopric of Münster. Only Roman Catholic worship was permitted, while Calvinism and Lutheranism were prohibited.

Sweden preferred to negotiate with the Holy Roman Empire in Osnabrück, which was controlled by Protestant forces. Osnabrück was a bi-denominational Lutheran and Catholic city, with two Lutheran churches and two Catholic churches. The city council was exclusively Lutheran, and the burghers mostly so, but the city also housed the Catholic Chapter of the Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück and had many other Catholic inhabitants. Osnabrück had been subjugated by troops of the Catholic League from 1628 to 1633 and was then taken by Lutheran Sweden.

==Delegations==

The peace negotiations had no exact beginning or end, because the 109 delegations never met in a plenary session. Instead, various delegations arrived between 1643 and 1646 and left between 1647 and 1649. The largest number of diplomats were present between January 1646 and July 1647.

Delegations had been sent by 16 European states, 66 Imperial States representing the interests of 140 Imperial States, and 27 interest groups representing 38 groups.
* The French delegation was headed by Henri II d&#x27;Orléans, Duke of Longueville and further comprised the diplomats Claude d&#x27;Avaux and Abel Servien.
* The Swedish delegation was headed by Count Johan Oxenstierna and was assisted by Baron Johan Adler Salvius.
* The Imperial delegation was headed by Count Maximilian von Trautmansdorff. His aides were:
** In Münster, Johann Ludwig von Nassau-Hadamar and Isaak Volmar.
** In Osnabrück, Johann Maximilian von Lamberg and Johann Krane.
* Philip IV of Spain was represented by two delegations:
** The Spanish delegation was headed by Gaspar de Bracamonte y Guzmán, and notably included the diplomats and writers Diego de Saavedra Fajardo, and Bernardino de Rebolledo.
** The Franche-Comté and the Spanish Netherlands were represented by Joseph de Bergaigne (who died before peace was concluded) and Antoine Brun.
* The papal nuncio in Cologne, Fabio Chigi, and the Venetian envoy, Alvise Contarini, acted as mediators.
* Various Imperial Estates of the Holy Roman Empire also sent delegations, among these Johann Ernst Pistoris represented the Electorate of Saxony, Johann VIII. zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Wittgenstein the Margraviate of Brandenburg, and Georg Christoph von Haslang the Electorate of Bavaria. Important protestant envoys were Wolfgang Conrad von Thumbshirn for Saxe-Altenburg and Jakob Lampadius for Brunswick-Lüneburg. The catholic estates were divided between those willing to compromise like Mainz represented by Hugo Eberhard Kratz von Scharfenstein, and catholic hardliner like Franz Wilhelm von Wartenberg for the Electorate of Cologne.
* The Dutch Republic sent a delegation of six, including two delegates from the province of Holland, including Adriaan Pauw, and Willem Ripperda from the province of Overijssel; two provinces were absent.
* The Swiss Confederacy was represented by Johann Rudolf Wettstein.

==Treaties==

Two separate treaties constituted the peace settlement:
* The Treaty of Münster (&quot;Instrumentum Pacis Monasteriensis&quot;, IPM), between the Holy Roman Emperor and France, along with their respective allies
* The Treaty of Osnabrück (&quot;Instrumentum Pacis Osnabrugensis&quot;, IPO), between the Holy Roman Emperor and Sweden, along with their respective allies

==Results==

===Westphalia pertaining to the Holy Roman Empire===

Much of the Peace of Westphalia focused on reorganizing the Holy Roman Empire, the main battleground of the 30 Years War.

A common idea is that Emperor Ferdinand III was stripped of power, and said power was given to the rulers of the Imperial estates. The extent to which Ferdinand&#x27;s power was diminished is now challenged by modern research, with some saying that Ferdinand&#x27;s loss of influence was overstated by older literature. The emperor still maintained significant power in the Imperial Diet, for example. Central authority was still maintained through institutions like the Aulic Council.

Westphalia guaranteed the right to practice any of the recognized denominations such as Catholicism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism. The latter was finally given legal recognition as an official religion. The independence of the Dutch Republic, which practiced religious toleration, also provided a safe haven for European Jews.

Contrary to common belief, the Peace of Westphalia did not necessarily reconfirm the status of the Peace of Augsburg (particularly the principle of &quot;cuius regio, eius religio&quot;). Rather, it provided a reinterpretation. What has been established by this treaty [of Westphalia], with the mutual agreement of the parties, concerning certain disputed articles in the Treaty of Augsburg, shall be regarded as a permanently valid interpretation of that treaty. This interpretation must be followed in court and elsewhere until religious matters can, with God’s grace, be resolved. This applies regardless of any objection or protest by anyone, whether clergy or laypeople, within or outside the Empire, at any time. All such objections are declared null and void by the terms of this treaty.

Whatever sovereignty the electors, princes, and estates of the Holy Roman Empire enjoyed in their territories, the private exercise of religion was no longer subject to this sovereignty but had effectively been removed from the sovereign domain.Rather than confirming the Augsburg settlement&#x27;s policy of &quot;ius reformandi&quot; (in which subjects were to follow their ruler&#x27;s religion), Westphalia replaced it with an interpretation that sovereign rulers such as princes could no longer dictate the religion of their subjects.

The Holy See was very displeased at the settlement, with Pope Innocent X calling it &quot;null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all time&quot; in the papal brief &quot;Zelo Domus Dei&quot;.

The Peace of Westphalia also set up new rules for the Reichskammergericht (Imperial Chamber Court), and stipulated that half its judges must be Protestant. Westphalia also called for 50 judges to be appointed, but this number was rarely reached due to financial issues.

===Tenets===

The main tenets of the Peace of Westphalia were:

* &quot;Ius reformandi&quot; was removed: Subjects were no longer forced to follow the religion of their ruler. Rulers were allowed to choose between Catholicism, Lutheranism, and Calvinism.
* 1 January 1624 was defined as the normative date for determining the official religion of a state (though as stated above, subjects did not need to follow the designated official religion). This law was engrained into Imperial law, meaning individual princes could not abolish it. Ecclesiastical property was to be restored to the condition of 1624.
* France and Sweden were recognised as guarantors of the imperial constitution with a right to intercede.

===Territorial adjustments===

* France retained the bishoprics of Metz, Toul and Verdun near Lorraine, received the cities of the Décapole in Alsace (except for Strasbourg, the Bishopric of Strasbourg, and Mulhouse) and the city of Pignerol near the Spanish Duchy of Milan.
* Sweden received an indemnity of five million thalers, which it used primarily to pay its troops. Sweden further received Western Pomerania (thenceforth Swedish Pomerania), Wismar, and the Prince-Bishoprics of Bremen and Verden as hereditary fiefs, thus gaining a seat and vote in the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire as well as in the Upper Saxon, Lower Saxon and Westphalian circle diets (&quot;Kreistage&quot;). However, the wording of the treaties was ambiguous:
:*To escape incorporation into Swedish Bremen-Verden, the city of Bremen had claimed Imperial immediacy. The emperor had granted this request and separated the city from the surrounding Bishopric of Bremen. Sweden launched the Swedish-Bremen wars in 1653/54 in a failed attempt to take the city.
:*The treaty did not decide the Swedish-Brandenburgian border in the Duchy of Pomerania. At Osnabrück, both Sweden and Brandenburg had claimed the whole duchy, which had been under Swedish control since 1630 despite legal claims of Brandenburgian succession. While the parties settled for a border in 1653, the underlying conflict continued.
:*The treaty ruled that the Dukes of Mecklenburg, owing their re-investiture to the Swedes, cede Wismar and the Mecklenburgian port tolls. While Sweden understood this to include the tolls of all Mecklenburgian ports, the Mecklenburgian dukes as well as the emperor understood this to refer to Wismar only.
:*Wildeshausen, a petty exclave of Bremen-Verden and fragile basis for Sweden&#x27;s seat in the Westphalian circle diet, was also claimed by the Bishopric of Münster.
* Bavaria retained the Palatinate&#x27;s vote in the Electoral College of the Holy Roman Empire, which it was granted by the imperial ban on the Elector Palatine Frederick V in 1623. The Prince Palatine, Frederick&#x27;s son, was given a &quot;new&quot;, eighth electoral vote.
* The Palatinate was divided between the re-established Elector Palatine Charles Louis (son and heir of Frederick V) and Elector-Duke Maximilian of Bavaria, and thus between the Protestants and Catholics. Charles Louis obtained the Lower Palatinate, along the Rhine, while Maximilian kept the Upper Palatinate, to the north of Bavaria.
* Brandenburg-Prussia received Farther Pomerania, and the Bishoprics of Magdeburg, Halberstadt, Kammin, and Minden.
* The Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück would alternate between Catholic and Lutheran bishops, with the Protestant bishops chosen from the cadets of the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg.
* The Swiss Confederacy attained legal independence from the Holy Roman Empire, although it had been de facto independent since the Treaty of Basel (1499).
* Barriers to trade and commerce erected during the war were abolished, and &quot;a degree&quot; of free navigation was guaranteed on the Rhine.

==Legacy==
The treaties did not entirely end conflicts arising out of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Fighting continued between France and Spain until the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659. The Dutch-Portuguese War that had begun during the Iberian Union between Spain and Portugal, as part of the Eighty Years&#x27; War, went on until 1663. Nevertheless, the Peace of Westphalia did settle many outstanding European issues of the time.

===Westphalian sovereignty===
Some scholars of international relations have identified the Peace of Westphalia as the origin of principles crucial to modern international relations, including the inviolability of borders and non-interference in the domestic affairs of sovereign states. This system became known in the literature as Westphalian sovereignty. Most modern historians have challenged the association of this system with the Peace of Westphalia, calling it the &quot;Westphalian myth&quot;. They have challenged the view that the modern European states system originated with the Westphalian treaties. The treaties do not contain anything in their text about religious freedom, sovereignty, or balance of power that can be construed as international law principles. Constitutional arrangements of the Holy Roman Empire are the only context in which sovereignty and religious equality are mentioned in the text, but they are not new ideas in this context. While the treaties do not contain the basis for the modern laws of nations themselves, they do symbolize the end of a long period of religious conflict in Europe.

<text>Pope Damasus I (; c. 305 – 11 December 384), also known as Damasus of Rome, was the bishop of Rome from October 366 to his death in 384. It is claimed that he presided over the Council of Rome of 382 that determined the canon or official list of sacred scripture. 

Damasus spoke out against major heresies (including Apollinarianism and Macedonianism), thus solidifying the faith of the Catholic Church, and encouraged production of the Vulgate Bible with his support for Jerome. He helped reconcile the relations between the Church of Rome and the Church of Antioch, and encouraged the veneration of martyrs.

As well as various prose letters and other pieces Damasus was the author of Latin verse. Alan Cameron describes his epitaph for a young girl called Projecta (of great interest to scholars as the Projecta Casket in the British Museum may have been made for her) as &quot;a tissue of tags and clichés shakily strung together and barely squeezed into the meter&quot;. Damasus has been described as &quot;the first society Pope&quot;, and was possibly a member of a group of Hispanic Christians, largely related to each other, who were close to the Hispanic Theodosius I.

A number of images of &quot;DAMAS&quot; in gold glass cups probably represent him and seem to be the first contemporary images of a pope to survive, though there is no real attempt at a likeness. &quot;Damas&quot; appears with other figures, including a Florus who may be Projecta&#x27;s father. It has been suggested that Damasus or another of the group commissioned and distributed these to friends or supporters, as part of a programme &quot;insistently inserting his episcopal presence in the Christian landscape&quot;.

He is recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church; his feast day is 11 December.

==Background==
His life coincided with the rise of Emperor Constantine I and the reunion and re-division of the Western and Eastern Roman Empires, which is associated with the legitimization of Christianity and its later adoption as the official religion of the Roman state in 380.

The reign of Gratian, which coincided with Damasus&#x27; papacy, forms an important epoch in ecclesiastical history, since during that period (359–383), Catholic Christianity for the first time became dominant throughout the empire. Under the influence of Ambrose, Gratian refused to wear the insignia of the &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; as unbefitting a Christian, removed the Altar of Victory from the Senate at Rome, despite protests from the pagan members of the Senate. Emperor Gratian also forbade legacies of real property to the Vestals and abolished other privileges belonging to them and to the pontiffs.

==Early life==
Pope Damasus I was either born in Rome, or in Lusitania around 305, before moving to Rome at a young age with his parents. Damasus&#x27; parents were Antonius, who became a priest at the Church of St. Lawrence (San Lorenzo) in Rome, and his wife Laurentia. Both parents originally came from the region of Lusitania. Damasus began his ecclesiastical career as a deacon in his father&#x27;s church, where he went on to serve as a priest. This later became the basilica of Saint Lawrence outside the Walls in Rome.

Damasus was archdeacon of the Roman church when Pope Liberius was banished by Emperor Constantius II to Berea in 354. Damasus followed Liberius into exile, though he immediately returned to Rome. During the period before Liberius&#x27; return, Damasus had a great share in the government of the church.

==Succession crisis==
In the early Church, bishops were customarily elected by the clergy and the people of the diocese. While this simple method worked well in a small community of Christians unified by persecution, as the congregation grew in size, the acclamation of a new bishop was fraught with division, and rival claimants and a certain class hostility between patrician and plebeian candidates unsettled some episcopal elections. At the same time, 4th-century emperors expected each new pope-elect to be presented to them for approval, which sometimes led to state domination of the Church&#x27;s internal affairs.

Following the death of Pope Liberius on 24 September 366, Damasus succeeded to the Papacy amidst factional violence. The deacons and laity supported Liberius&#x27; deacon Ursinus. The upper-class former partisans of Felix, who had ruled during Liberius&#x27; exile, supported the election of Damasus.

The two were elected simultaneously (Damasus&#x27; election was held in San Lorenzo in Lucina). J. N. D. Kelly states that Damasus hired a gang of thugs that stormed the Julian Basilica, carrying out a three-day massacre of the Ursinians. Thomas Shahan says details of this scandalous conflict are related in the highly prejudiced &quot;Libellus precum ad Imperatores&quot; (P.L., XIII, 83–107), a petition to the civil authority on the part of Faustinus and , two anti-Damasan presbyters. Such was the violence and bloodshed that the two prefects of the city were called in to restore order, and after a first setback, when they were driven to the suburbs and a massacre of 137 was perpetrated in the basilica of Sicininus (the modern Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore), the prefects banished Ursinus to Gaul. There was further violence when he returned, which continued after Ursinus was exiled again.

Another ancient narrative of events, the &quot;Gesta&quot; (dated to 368 AD), provides more detail. It describes Ursinus as being the valid successor to Liberius, and Damasus as following a heretical interloper, Felix. This account also records that an armed force instigated by Damasus broke into the Basilica of Julius and a three-day slaughtering of those assembled there took place. After gaining control of the Lateran basilica Damasus was then ordained as bishop in the cathedral of Rome. However, Damasus was accused of bribing the urban officials of Rome to have Ursinus and chief supporters exiled, including some presbyters. As a result of this attempt, some of the (apparently quite numerous) supporters of Ursinus interrupted this process and rescued the presbyters, taking them to the Basilica of Liberius (identified as the &quot;basilica of Sicinnius&quot;), the apparent headquarters of the Ursinian sect. Damasus then responded by ordering an attack against the Liberian basilica, resulting in another massacre: &quot;They broke down the doors and set fire underneath it, then rushed in...and killed a hundred and sixty of the people inside, both men and women.&quot; Damasus next sent a final assault against some Ursinian supporters who had fled to the cemetery of Saint Agnes, slaying many.

Church historians such as Jerome and Rufinus championed Damasus. At a synod in 378, Ursinus was condemned and Damasus exonerated and declared the true pope. The former antipope continued to intrigue against Damasus for the next few years and unsuccessfully attempted to revive his claim on Damasus&#x27;s death. Ursinus was among the Arian party in Milan, according to Ambrose.

==Papacy==
Damasus faced accusations of murder and adultery in his early years as pope. The accuracy of these claims has come into question with some suggesting that the accusations were motivated by the conflict with the supporters of Arianism.

Damasus I was active in defending the Catholic Church against the threat of schisms. In two Roman synods (368 and 369) he condemned Apollinarianism and Macedonianism, and sent legates to the First Council of Constantinople that was convoked in 381 to address these heresies.

===Council of Rome of 382 and the Biblical canon===
One of the important works of Pope Damasus was to preside in the Council of Rome of 382, which determined the canon or official list of Sacred Scripture. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church states:
A council probably held at Rome in 382 under Damasus gave a complete list of the canonical books of both the Old Testament and the New Testament (also known as the &#x27;Gelasian Decree&#x27; because it was reproduced by Gelasius in 495), which is identical with the list given at Trent. American Catholic priest and historian William Jurgens stated: &quot;The first part of this decree has long been known as the Decree of Damasus, and concerns the Holy Spirit and the seven-fold gifts. The second part of the decree is more familiarly known as the opening part of the Gelasian Decree, in regard to the canon of Scripture: It is now commonly held that the part of the Gelasian Decree dealing with the accepted canon of Scripture is an authentic work of the Council of Rome of 382 A.D. and that Gelasius edited it again at the end of the fifth century, adding to it the catalog of the rejected books, the apocrypha. It is now almost universally accepted that these parts one and two of the Decree of Damasus are authentic parts of the Acts of the Council of Rome of 382 A.D.&quot;

===Jerome, the Vulgate and the Canon===

Pope Damasus appointed Jerome of Stridon as his confidential secretary. Invited to Rome originally to a synod of 382 convened to end the schism of Antioch, he made himself indispensable to the pope, and took a prominent place in his councils. Jerome spent three years (382–385) in Rome in close intercourse with Pope Damasus and the leading Christians. Writing in 409, Jerome remarked: &quot;A great many years ago when I was helping Damasus, bishop of Rome with his ecclesiastical correspondence, and writing his answers to the questions referred to him by the councils of the east and west...&quot;

In order to put an end to the marked divergences in the western texts of that period, Damasus encouraged the highly respected scholar Jerome to revise the available Old Latin versions of the Bible into a more accurate Latin on the basis of the Greek New Testament and the Septuagint, resulting in the Vulgate. According to Protestant biblical scholar, F.F. Bruce, the commissioning of the Vulgate was a key moment in fixing the biblical canon in the West. Nonetheless, as the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; states:

Significant scholarly doubts and disagreements about the nature of the Apocrypha continued for centuries and even into Trent, which provided the first infallible definition of the Catholic canon in 1546.

Jerome devoted a very brief notice to Damasus in his &quot;De Viris Illustribus&quot;, written after Damasus&#x27; death: &quot;he had a fine talent for making verses and published many brief works in heroic metre. He died in the reign of the emperor Theodosius at the age of almost eighty&quot;. Damasus may be the author of the anonymous &quot;Carmen contra paganos&quot; (song against the pagans).

====Letter of Jerome to Damasus====

The letters from Jerome to Damasus are examples of the primacy of the See of Peter:
===Relations with the Eastern Church===

The Eastern Church, in the person of Basil of Caesarea, earnestly sought the aid and encouragement of Damasus against an apparently triumphant Arianism. Damasus, however, harbored some degree of suspicion against the great Cappadocian Doctor of the Church. In the matter of the Meletian Schism at Antioch, Damasus – together with Athanasius of Alexandria, and his successor, Peter II of Alexandria – sympathized with the party of Paulinus as more sincerely representative of Nicene orthodoxy. On the death of Meletius he sought to secure the succession for Paulinus and to exclude Flavian. During his papacy, Peter II of Alexandria sought refuge in Rome from the persecuting Arians. He was received by Damasus, who supported him against the Arians.

Damasus supported the appeal of the Christian senators to Emperor Gratian for the removal of the altar of Victory from the Senate House, and lived to welcome the famous edict of Theodosius I, &quot;De fide Catholica&quot; (27 February 380), which proclaimed as the religion of the Roman State that doctrine which Peter had preached to the Romans.
===Devotion to the martyrs===
Damasus also did much to encourage the veneration of the Christian martyrs, restoring and creating access to their tombs in the Catacombs of Rome and elsewhere, and setting up tablets with verse inscriptions composed by himself, several of which survive or are recorded in his &quot;Epigrammata&quot;.

Damasus rebuilt or repaired his father&#x27;s church named for Laurence, known as San Lorenzo fuori le Mura (&quot;St Lawrence outside the walls&quot;), which by the 7th century was a station on the itineraries of the graves of the Roman martyrs. Damasus&#x27; regard for the Roman martyr is attested also by the tradition according to which the Pope built a church devoted to Laurence in his own house, San Lorenzo in Damaso.

Damasus was pope for eighteen years and two months. His feast day is 11 December. He was buried beside his mother and sister in a &quot;funerary basilica ... somewhere between the Via Appia and Via Ardeatina&quot;, the exact location of which is lost.

Since 2011, this saint has given its name to the San Damaso Ecclesiastical University, a Catholic center of higher education belonging to the Archbishopric of Madrid, in Spain, where theology, Canon Law, Religious Sciences, Christian and Classical Literature, and Philosophy can be studied.

<doc id="23852" wikidata="Q170502" url="?curid=23852" title="Pope Honorius I">
<text>Pope Honorius I (died 12 October 638) was the bishop of Rome from 27 October 625 to his death. He was active in spreading Christianity among Anglo-Saxons and attempted to convince the Celts to calculate Easter in the Roman fashion. He is chiefly remembered for his correspondence with Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople over the latter&#x27;s monothelite teachings. Honorius was posthumously anathematized, initially for subscribing to monothelitism, and later only for failing to end it. The anathema against Honorius I became one of the central arguments against the doctrine of papal infallibility.

== Early life ==
Honorius was a rich aristocrat who came from Campania. His father was the consul Petronius. Nothing is known about Honorius I&#x27;s career before he became pope on 27 October 625. He was consecrated only two days after the death of his predecessor, Boniface V. The vacancy was short probably because of the presence in Rome of Isaac the Armenian, who was empowered to confirm the election as the imperial exarch in Italy.

== Papacy ==
As pope, Honorius I looked up to Gregory I and employed monks rather than secular clergy as staff at the Lateran Palace. He initially supported Adaloald, the deposed Catholic king of the Lombards, but established cordial relations with Adoald&#x27;s Arian rival Arioald. He did not succeed in resolving the schism of Venetia-Istria, but took steps to appease the archbishops of Ravenna, who were dissatisfied with their subordination to Rome. Honorius actively supported the difficult Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England and sent Birinus to convert the West Saxons, but less successful in convincing the Celts to abandon their system of computing the date of Easter. At the Sixth Council of Toledo, Honorius urged the Visigothic bishops to continue baptizing Jews, a policy instituted by Gregory I.

Honorius became involved in early discussions regarding the doctrine of Monothelitism, which is the teaching that Christ has only one energy and one will, in contrast with the teaching that he has two energies and two wills, both human and divine. Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople wrote an initial letter informing Honorius of the Monoenergism controversy, asking Honorius to endorse a position that Church unity should not be endangered by having any discussions or disputes over Christ&#x27;s possessing one energy or two. Sergius added that the doctrine of two energies could lead to the erroneous belief that Jesus has two conflicting wills. Pope Honorius’ reply in 635 endorsed this view that all discussions over energies should cease, and agreed that Jesus does not have two conflicting wills, but one will, since Jesus did not assume the vitiated human nature tainted by Adam&#x27;s fall, but human nature as it existed prior to Adam&#x27;s fall.

Honorius however did not endorse Monothelitism as his latter accusers would charge him. Rather it was known in the west that he was not a Monothelite and his secretary and author of the letter, the Abbot John, testified that &quot;When we spoke of a single will in the Lord, we did not have in view His double nature, divine and human, but His humanity only…. We meant that Jesus Christ did not have two contrary wills, that is to say one of the flesh and one of the spirit, as we ourselves have on account of sin, but that, with regard to His humanity, He had but one natural will.&quot;

Pope John IV, Honorius&#x27; near immediate successor, also noted that Honorius spoke &quot;only of the human and not also of the divine nature&quot; when commenting on Honorius&#x27; use of the phrase &quot;one will&quot;. St Maximus the Confessor is another notable figure who rose to the defense of Honorius&#x27; orthodoxy. In writing about Pope Honorius, Venerable Bede notes his constant sanctity, a point Robert Bellarmine does not fail to notice and amplify in saying, For, that Bede considered Honorius to be a holy man, also after his death, is clear both from book 2, chapters 17–19 in his history of the English people, where he often speaks about Honorius as an excellent pastor, and from the life of the Abbot St. Bertolfus, where he calls Honorius, now blessed, now holy, and among other things he also says: &quot;Honorius was a venerable bishop, wise in his thinking, strong in giving counsel, clear in doctrine, distinguished for his sweetness and humility.&quot; And after that: &quot;The holy Pope offered the desired office to the mentioned father Bertolfus, namely, the privileges of the apostolic See, inasmuch as none of the bishops in the previously mentioned cloister attempted to rule in any way.&quot; These are Bede’s words about Honorius; certainly he would not have said such things, if he considered him to be a condemned heretic, as the adversaries claim.

Honorius was apparently aware of the rise of Islam and viewed this religion&#x27;s tenets as closely resembling those of Arius.

== Legacy ==

In the Third Council of Constantinople on 16 September 681, the monothelites were anathematized by name &quot;and with them Honorius, who was Prelate of Rome, as having followed them in all things&quot; in the XIII session. Citing his written correspondence with Sergius, Honorius was subsequently accused of having confirmed his impious doctrines; the XVI session reaffirmed the condemnation of the heretics explicitly stating &quot;to Honorius, the heretic, anathema!&quot;, and concluding with the decree of the XVII session that 
Honorius had not stopped provoking scandal and error in the Body of the Church; for he had &quot;with unheard of expressions disseminated amidst the faithful people the heresy of the one will&quot;, doing so &quot;in agreement with the insane false doctrine of the impious Apollinaire, Severus and Themistius&quot;. The Roman legates made no objection to his condemnation.

Pope Leo II&#x27;s letter of confirmation of the Council commended it for it had &quot;perfectly preached the definition of the true faith&quot; and made reference to the condemnation of his predecessor:

Within the year a Latin translation of the Acts of the council had been disseminated and signed by the Bishops throughout the West. The condemnation of Pope Honorius was reiterated by Pope Leo&#x27;s successors and subsequent councils, and was included in Breviary lessons up until the eighteenth century. As a result, Honorius would later be the subject of vigorous attacks by opponents of papal infallibility in the discussions surrounding the First Vatican Council of 1870. In contemporary times, that Honorius actually agreed with Sergius on the doctrine of monothelitism has given rise to much discussion, and John B. Bury argues that the most reasonable conclusion is that Honorius did not really apprehend the point at issue, considering it more a question of grammar than theology, for he placed &quot;one energy&quot; and &quot;two energies&quot; on exactly the same footing; in Bury&#x27;s words, &quot;it was for the &#x27;imprudent economy of silence&#x27; that he was condemned&quot;.
