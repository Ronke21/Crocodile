<text>The Summer Olympic Games, also known as the Summer Olympics or the Games of the Olympiad, is a major international multi-sport event normally held once every four years. The inaugural Games took place in 1896 in Athens, then part of the Kingdom of Greece, and the most recent was held in 2024 in Paris, France. This was the first international multi-sport event of its kind, organized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) founded by Pierre de Coubertin. The tradition of awarding medals began in 1904; in each Olympic event, gold medals are awarded for first place, silver medals for second place, and bronze medals for third place. The Winter Olympic Games were created out of the success of the Summer Olympic Games, which are regarded as the largest and most prestigious multi-sport international event in the world.

The Summer Olympics have increased in scope from a 42-event competition programme in 1896 with fewer than 250 male competitors from 14 nations, to 339 events in 2021 with 11,420 competitors (almost half of whom were women) from 206 nations. The Games have been held in nineteen countries over five continents: four times in the United States (1904, 1932, 1984, and 1996), three times in Great Britain (1908, 1948, and 2012) and in France (1900, 1924, and 2024), twice each in Greece (1896 and 2004), Germany (1936 and 1972), Australia (1956 and 2000), and Japan (1964 and 2020), and once each in Sweden (1912), Belgium (1920), the Netherlands (1928), Finland (1952), Italy (1960), Mexico (1968), Canada (1976), Russia (1980), South Korea (1988), Spain (1992), China (2008), and Brazil (2016).

London and Paris have hosted three times, Los Angeles, Athens, and Tokyo have each hosted twice; Los Angeles will host the Games for the third time in 2028. Only five countries have participated in every Summer Olympic Games: Australia, France, Great Britain, Greece, and Switzerland. Australia, France, and Great Britain have won at least a medal at every edition of the Games, with Great Britain as the only one that never failed to win at least a gold medal. The United States leads the all-time medal count for the Summer Olympics, and has topped the medal table on 19 separate occasions—followed by the USSR (seven times, including the 1992 &#x27;Unified Team&#x27;), and France, Great Britain, Germany and China (once each).

==Hosting==
The United States hosted the Summer Olympic Games four times: the 1904 Games were held in St. Louis, Missouri; the 1932 and 1984 Games were both held in Los Angeles, California, and the 1996 Games were held in Atlanta, Georgia. The 2028 Games in Los Angeles will mark the fifth occasion on which the Summer Games have been hosted by the U.S.

In 2012, London hosted its third Summer Olympic Games and became the first city ever to have hosted the Summer Olympic Games three times, which then followed by Paris in 2024. The cities of Los Angeles, Tokyo and Athens (excluding 1906) have each hosted two Summer Olympic Games. In 2028, Los Angeles will in turn become the third city ever to have hosted the Games three times.

Australia, Germany, Greece and Japan all hosted the Summer Olympic Games twice (with Australia planned to host in 2032, therefore taking it to three). Tokyo, Japan, hosted the 2020 Games and became the first city outside the predominantly English-speaking and European nations to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having already hosted the Games in 1964; it is also the largest city ever to have hosted, having grown considerably since 1964. The other countries to have hosted the Summer Olympics are Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Finland, Italy, Mexico, Netherlands, South Korea, Soviet Union, Spain, and Sweden, with each of these countries having hosted the Summer Games on one occasion.

Asia has hosted the Summer Olympics four times: in Tokyo (1964 and 2020), Seoul (1988), and Beijing (2008).

The 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, were the first Summer Olympics to be held in South America and the first that was held completely during the local &quot;winter&quot; season. The only two countries in the Southern Hemisphere to have hosted the Summer Olympics have been Australia (1956, 2000, and upcoming 2032) and Brazil (2016), with Africa having yet to host any Summer Olympics.

Stockholm, Sweden, has hosted events at two Summer Olympics, having been sole host of the 1912 Games, and hosting the equestrian events at the 1956 Summer Olympics (which they are credited as jointly hosting with Melbourne, Australia). Amsterdam, Netherlands, has also hosted events at two Summer Olympic Games, having been sole host of the 1928 Games and previously hosting two of the sailing races at the 1920 Summer Olympics. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Hong Kong provided the venues for the equestrian events, which took place in Sha Tin and Kwu Tung.

==History==
===Early years===
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) was founded in 1894 when Pierre de Coubertin, a French pedagogue and historian, sought to promote international understanding through sporting competition. The first edition of The Olympic Games was held in Athens in 1896 and attracted just 245 competitors, of whom more than 200 were Greek, and only 14 countries were represented. Nevertheless, no international events of this magnitude had been organised before. Female athletes were not allowed to compete, though one woman, Stamata Revithi, ran the marathon course on her own, saying, &quot;If the committee doesn&#x27;t let me compete, I will go after them regardless&quot;. Women first participated officially in the 1900 Paris Games, with 22 women competing in five sports. Female participation has increased dramatically since then, with nearly half of the athletes in recent Games being women.

The 1896 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event which was celebrated in Athens, Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896. It was the first Olympic Games held in the modern era. About 100,000 people attended for the opening of the games. The athletes came from 14 nations, with most coming from Greece. Although Greece had the most athletes, the U.S. finished with the most champions. 11 Americans placed first in their events vs. the 10 from Greece. Ancient Greece was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, consequently Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games. It was unanimously chosen as the host city during a congress organised by Pierre de Coubertin in Paris, on 23 June 1894. The IOC was also established during this congress.

Despite many obstacles and setbacks, the 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success. The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. Panathinaiko Stadium, the first big stadium in the modern world, overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event. The highlight for the Greeks was the Marathon victory by their compatriot Spiridon Louis, a water carrier. He won in 2 hours, 58 minutes and 50 seconds, setting off wild celebrations at the stadium. The most successful competitor was German wrestler and gymnast Carl Schuhmann, who won four gold medals.

Greek officials and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared by many of the athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world. The second Olympics was held in Paris.

Four years later the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris attracted more than four times as many athletes, including 20 women, who were allowed to officially compete for the first time, in croquet, golf, sailing, and tennis. The Games were integrated with the Paris World&#x27;s Fair and lasted over five months. It has been disputed which exact events were &quot;Olympic&quot;, as some events were for professionals, some had restricted eligibility, and others lacked international competitors.


Tensions caused by the Russo–Japanese War and the difficulty of getting to St. Louis may have contributed to the fact that very few top-ranked athletes from outside the US and Canada took part in the 1904 Games, the first Games held outside Europe.

The &quot;Second International Olympic Games in Athens&quot;, as they were called at the time, were held in 1906. The IOC does not currently recognise these games as being official Olympic Games, although many historians do and credit the 1906 games with preventing the demise of the Olympics. The 1906 Athens games were the first of an alternating series of games to be held in Athens in even non-Olympic years, but the series failed to materialise. The games were more successful than the 1900 and 1904 games, with over 850 athletes competing, and contributed positively to the success of future games.

The 1908 London Games saw numbers rise again, as well as the first running of the marathon over its now-standard distance of 42.195  km (26 miles 385 yards). The first Olympic Marathon in 1896 (a male-only race) was raced at a distance of 40  km (24 miles 85 yards). The new marathon distance was chosen to ensure that the race finished in front of the box occupied by the British royal family. Thus the marathon had been for the first games in 1896, but was subsequently varied by up to due to local conditions such as street and stadium layout. At the six Olympic games between 1900 and 1920, the marathon was raced over six distances. The Games saw Great Britain winning 146 medals, 99 more than second-placed Americans, its best result to this day.

At the end of the 1908 marathon, the Italian runner Dorando Pietri was first to enter the stadium, but he was clearly in distress and collapsed of exhaustion before he could complete the event. He was helped over the finish line by concerned race officials and later disqualified for that. As compensation for the missing medal, Queen Alexandra gave Pietri a gilded silver cup. Arthur Conan Doyle wrote a special report about the race in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

The Games continued to grow, attracting 2,504 competitors, to Stockholm in 1912, including the great all-rounder Jim Thorpe, who won both the decathlon and pentathlon. Thorpe had previously played a few games of baseball for a fee, and saw his medals stripped for this &#x27;breach&#x27; of amateurism after complaints from Avery Brundage. They were reinstated in 1983, 30 years after his death. The Games at Stockholm were the first to fulfil Pierre de Coubertin&#x27;s original idea. For the first time since the Games started in 1896, all five inhabited continents were represented with athletes competing in the same stadium.

The scheduled 1916 Summer Olympics were to be held in Berlin, cancelled following the onset of World War I.

===Interwar era===
The 1920 Antwerp Games in war-ravaged Belgium were a subdued affair, but again drew a record number of competitors. This record only stood until 1924, when the Paris Games involved 3,000 competitors, the greatest of whom was Finnish runner Paavo Nurmi. The &quot;Flying Finn&quot; won three team gold medals and the individual 1,500 and 5,000 meter runs, the latter two on the same day.

The 1928 Amsterdam Games was notable for being the first games which allowed females to compete at track &amp; field athletics, and benefited greatly from the general prosperity of the times alongside the first appearance of sponsorship of the games, from the Coca-Cola Company. The 1928 games saw the introduction of a standard medal design with the IOC, choosing Giuseppe Cassioli&#x27;s depiction of Greek goddess Nike with a winner being carried by a crowd of people. This design was used up until 1972.

The 1932 Los Angeles Games were affected by the Great Depression, which contributed to the low number of competitors.

The 1936 Berlin Games were seen by the German government as a golden opportunity to promote their ideology. The ruling Nazi Party commissioned film-maker Leni Riefenstahl to film the games. The result, &quot;Olympia&quot;, was widely considered to be a masterpiece, despite the infusion of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s theories of Aryan racial superiority. Individually, African-American sprinter and long jumper Jesse Owens won four gold medals, while the host nation won the most gold and overall medals. The 1936 Berlin Games also saw the introduction of the Torch Relay.

Due to World War II, the 1940 Games (due to be held in Tokyo and temporarily relocated to Helsinki upon the outbreak of the war) were cancelled. The 1944 Games were due to be held in London but were also cancelled; instead, London hosted the first games after the end of the war, in 1948.

===After World War II===
The first post-war Games were held in 1948 in London, with both Germany and Japan excluded. Dutch sprinter Fanny Blankers-Koen won four gold medals on the track, emulating Owens&#x27; achievement in Berlin.

At the 1952 Helsinki Games, the USSR team competed for the first time and quickly emerged as one of the dominant teams, finishing second in the number of gold and overall medals won. Their immediate success might be explained by the advent of the state-sponsored &quot;full-time amateur athlete&quot;. The USSR entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis, hence violating amateur rules. Finland made a legend of an amiable Czechoslovak Army lieutenant named Emil Zátopek, who was intent on improving on his single gold and silver medals from 1948. Having first won both the 10,000- and 5,000-meter races, he also entered the marathon, despite having never previously raced at that distance. Pacing himself by chatting with the other race leaders, Zátopek led from about halfway, slowly dropping the remaining contenders to win by two and a half minutes, and completed a trio of wins.

The 1956 Melbourne Games, the first in the Southern Hemisphere, were largely successful, with the exception of a water polo match between Hungary and the Soviet Union, which ended in a pitched battle between the teams on account of the Soviet invasion of Hungary. The equestrian events were held in Stockholm due to a foot-and-mouth disease outbreak in Britain at the time and the strict quarantine laws of Australia.

At the 1960 Rome Games, a young light-heavyweight boxer named Cassius Clay, later known as Muhammad Ali, arrived on the scene. Ali would later throw his gold medal away in disgust after being refused service in a whites-only restaurant in his home town of Louisville, Kentucky. He was awarded a new medal 36 years later at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. Other notable performers in 1960 included Wilma Rudolph, a gold medallist in the 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4 × 100 meters relay events.

The 1964 Tokyo Games were the first to be held in Asia and to be broadcast worldwide on television, enabled by the recent advent of communication satellites. These Games marked a turning point in the global visibility and popularity of the Olympics and are credited for heralding the modern age of telecommunications. Judo debuted as an official sport, and Dutch judoka Anton Geesink caused a stir when he won the final of the open weight division, defeating Akio Kaminaga in front of his home crowd.

Performances at the 1968 Games in Mexico City were affected by the altitude of the host city. These Games introduced the now-universal Fosbury flop, a technique which won American high jumper Dick Fosbury the gold medal. In the medal award ceremony for the men&#x27;s 200-meter race, black American athletes Tommie Smith (gold medal winner) and John Carlos (bronze medal winner) took a stand for civil rights by raising their black-gloved fists and wearing black socks in lieu of shoes. The two athletes were subsequently expelled from the Games by the IOC. Věra Čáslavská, in protest against the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia, and the controversial decision by the judges on the balance beam and floor, turned her head down and away from the Soviet flag while the national anthem was played during the medal ceremony. She returned home as a heroine of the Czechoslovak people but was made an outcast by the Soviet-dominated government.

Politics again intervened at the 1972 Games in Munich, but this time with lethal consequences. A Palestinian terrorist group named Black September invaded the Olympic village and broke into the apartment of the Israeli delegation. They killed two Israelis and held nine others as hostages, demanding that Israel release numerous prisoners. When the Israeli government refused the terrorists&#x27; demands, the situation developed into a tense stand-off while negotiations continued. Eventually, the captors, still holding their hostages, were offered safe passage and taken to an airport, where they were ambushed by German security forces. In the ensuing firefight, 15 people were killed, including the nine captive Israeli athletes and five of the terrorists. After much debate, the decision was taken to continue the Games, but the proceedings were understandably dominated by these events. Some memorable athletic achievements did occur during these Games, notably the winning of a then-record seven gold medals by United States swimmer Mark Spitz, Finland&#x27;s Lasse Virén taking back-to-back gold medals in the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, and the winning of three gold medals by Soviet gymnastic star Olga Korbut, who achieved a historic backflip off the high bar. In the final of the men&#x27;s basketball, the United States lost to the Soviet Union in what is widely considered as the most controversial game in international basketball history. In a close-fought match, the U.S. team appeared to have won by a score of 50–49. However, the final three seconds of the game were replayed three times by judges until the Soviet team came out on top and claimed a 51–50 victory. Ultimately the U.S. team refused to accept their silver medals.

There was no such tragedy at the 1976 Montreal Games, but bad planning and fraud led to the cost of these Games far exceeding the budget. Costing $1.5 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ), the 1976 Summer Games were the most expensive in Olympic history (until the 2014 Winter Olympics) and it seemed, for a time, that the Olympics might no longer be a viable financial proposition. In retrospect, it is believed that contractors (suspected of being members of the Montreal Mafia) skimmed large sums of money from all levels of contracts while also profiting from the substitution of cheaper building materials of lesser quality, which may have contributed to the delays, poor construction, and excessive costs. In 1988, one such contractor, Giuseppe Zappia &quot;was cleared of fraud charges that resulted from his work on Olympic facilities after two key witnesses died before testifying at his trial&quot;. The 1976 Games were boycotted by many African nations as a protest against a recent tour of apartheid-run South Africa by the New Zealand national rugby union team. Romanian gymnast Nadia Comăneci made history when she won the women&#x27;s individual all-around gold medal with two of four possible perfect scores. She won two other individual events, with two perfect scores in the balance beam and all perfect scores in the uneven bars. Lasse Virén repeated his double gold in the 5,000 and 10,000 meters, making him the first athlete to ever win the distance double twice.
===End of the 20th century===
Following the Soviet Union&#x27;s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan, 66 nations, including the United States, Canada, West Germany, and Japan, boycotted the 1980 Games held in Moscow. Eighty nations were represented at the Moscow Games – the smallest number since 1956. The boycott contributed to the 1980 Games being a less publicised and less competitive affair, which was dominated by the host country.

According to British journalist Andrew Jennings, a KGB colonel stated that the agency&#x27;s officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the IOC to undermine doping tests and that Soviet athletes were &quot;rescued with [these] tremendous efforts&quot;. On the topic of the 1980 Summer Olympics, an Australian study in 1989 said &quot;There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds. The Moscow Games might as well have been called the Chemists&#x27; Games.&quot;

Documents obtained in 2016 revealed the Soviet Union&#x27;s plans for a statewide doping system in track and field in preparation for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Dated prior to the country&#x27;s decision to boycott the Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the programme, along with suggestions for further enhancements. The communication, directed to the Soviet Union&#x27;s head of track and field, was prepared by Dr. Sergei Portugalov of the Institute for Physical Culture. Portugalov was also one of the main figures involved in the implementation of the Russian doping programme prior to the 2016 Summer Olympics.

In 1984, the Soviet Union and 13 Soviet allies retaliated by boycotting the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Romania and Yugoslavia, notably are the only two countries from the Eastern Bloc that did attend the 1984 Olympics. These games were perhaps the first games of a new era to make a profit. Although a boycott led by the Soviet Union depleted the field in certain sports, 140 National Olympic Committees took part, which was a record at the time. The Games were also the first time mainland China (People&#x27;s Republic) participated.

The 1988 Games, in Seoul, was very well planned but the games were tainted when many of the athletes, most notably men&#x27;s 100 metres winner Ben Johnson, failed mandatory drug tests. Despite splendid drug-free performances by many individuals, the number of people who failed screenings for performance-enhancing chemicals overshadowed the games.

The 1992 Barcelona Games featured the admittance of players from one of the North American top leagues, the NBA, exemplified by but not limited to US basketball&#x27;s &quot;Dream Team&quot;. The 1992 games also saw the reintroduction to the Games of several smaller European states which had been annexed into the Soviet Union during World War II. At these games, gymnast Vitaly Scherbo set an inaugural medal record of five individual gold medals at a Summer Olympics, and equaled the inaugural record set by Eric Heiden at the 1980 Winter Olympics.

By then the process of choosing a location for the Games had become a commercial concern; there were widespread allegations of corruption potentially affecting the IOC&#x27;s decision process.

At the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics, the highlight was 200 meters runner Michael Johnson annihilating the world record in front of a home crowd. Canadians savoured Donovan Bailey&#x27;s recording gold medal run in the 100-meter dash. This was popularly felt to be an appropriate recompense for the previous national disgrace involving Ben Johnson. There were also emotional scenes, such as when Muhammad Ali, clearly affected by Parkinson&#x27;s disease, lit the Olympic torch and received a replacement medal for the one he had discarded in 1960. The latter event took place in the basketball arena. The atmosphere at the Games was marred, however, when a bomb exploded during the celebration in Centennial Olympic Park. In June 2003, the principal suspect in this bombing, Eric Robert Rudolph, was arrested.

The 2000 Summer Olympics, held in Sydney, Australia, showcased individual performances by locals favorites Ian Thorpe in the pool and Cathy Freeman, an Indigenous Australian whose triumph in the 400 meters united a packed stadium., Briton Steve Redgrave who won a rowing gold medal in an unprecedented fifth consecutive Olympics, and Eric &quot;the Eel&quot; Moussambani, a swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, received wide media coverage when he completed the 100 meter freestyle swim in by far the slowest time in Olympic history. He nevertheless won the heat as both his opponents had been disqualified for false starts. His female compatriot Paula Barila Bolopa also received media attention for her record-slow and struggling but courageous performance. The Sydney Games also saw the first appearance of a joint North and South Korean contingent at the opening ceremonies, though they competed in all events as different teams. Controversy occurred in the Women&#x27;s Artistic Gymnastics when the vaulting horse was set to the wrong height during the All-Around Competition.

===Start of the 21st century===
In 2004, the Olympic Games returned to their birthplace in Athens, Greece. At least $7.2 billion was spent on the 2004 Games, including $1.5 billion on security. Michael Phelps won his first Olympic medals, tallying six gold and two bronze medals. Pyrros Dimas, winning a bronze medal, became the most decorated weightlifter of all time with four Olympic medals, three gold and one bronze. Although unfounded reports of potential terrorism drove crowds away from the preliminary competitions at the first weekend of the Olympics (14–15 August 2004), attendance picked up as the Games progressed. A third of the tickets failed to sell, but ticket sales still topped figures from the Seoul and Barcelona Olympics (1988 and 1992). IOC President Jacques Rogge characterised Greece&#x27;s organisation as outstanding and its security precautions as flawless. All 202 NOCs participated at the Athens Games with over 11,000 participants.

The 2008 Summer Olympics was held in Beijing, People&#x27;s Republic of China. Several new events were held, including the new discipline of BMX for both men and women. Women competed in the steeplechase for the first time. The fencing programme was expanded to include all six events for both men and women; previously, women had not been able to compete in team foil or sabre events, although women&#x27;s team épée and men&#x27;s team foil were dropped for these Games. Marathon swimming events were added, over the distance of . Also, the doubles events in table tennis were replaced by team events. American swimmer Michael Phelps set a record for gold medals at a single Games with eight, and tied the record of most gold medals by a single competitor previously held by both Eric Heiden and Vitaly Scherbo. Another notable star of the Games was Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt, who became the first male athlete ever to set world records in the finals of both the 100 and 200 metres in the same Games. Equestrian events were held in Hong Kong.

London held the 2012 Summer Olympics, becoming the first city to host the Olympic Games three times. In his closing address, Jacques Rogge described the Games as &quot;Happy and glorious&quot;. The host nation won 29 gold medals, the best haul for Great Britain since the 1908 Games in London. The United States returned to the top of the medal table after China dominated in 2008. The IOC had removed baseball and softball from the 2012 programme. The London Games were successful on a commercial level because they were the first in history to completely sell out every ticket, with as many as 1 million applications for 40,000 tickets for both the Opening Ceremony and the 100m Men&#x27;s Sprint Final. Such was the demand for tickets to all levels of each event that there was controversy over seats being set aside for sponsors and National Delegations which went unused in the early days. A system of reallocation was put in place so the empty seats were filled throughout the Games.

===Recent Games===
Rio de Janeiro in Brazil hosted the 2016 Summer Olympics, becoming the first South American city to host the Olympics, the second Olympic host city in Latin America, after Mexico City in 1968, as well as the third city in the Southern Hemisphere to host the Olympics after Melbourne, Australia, in 1956 and Sydney, Australia, in 2000. The preparation for these Games was overshadowed by controversies, including political instability and an economic crisis in the host country, health and safety concerns surrounding the Zika virus, and significant pollution in the Guanabara Bay. However, these concerns were superseded by a state-sponsored doping scandal involving Russian athletes at the Winter Olympics held two years earlier, which affected the participation of its athletes in these Games.

The 2020 Summer Olympics were originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020 in Tokyo, Japan. The city was the fifth in history to host the Games twice and the first Asian city to have this title. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the then-Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the IOC and the Tokyo Organising Committee announced that the 2020 Games were to be delayed until 2021, marking the first time that the Olympic Games have been postponed. This was the first time since 1900 that the games were not held in a leap year, and were instead hosted on a non-leap year. Unlike previous Olympics, these Games took place without spectators due to concerns over COVID-19 and a state of emergency imposed in the host city. Nevertheless, the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games featured many memorable moments and feats of technical excellence. One star of the Games, U.S. gymnast Simone Biles, gracefully bowed out to focus on her mental health, but later returned to claim an individual bronze medal. Norway&#x27;s Karsten Warholm smashed his own world record in the 400m hurdles.

The 2024 Summer Olympics were held in Paris, France, making it the second city after London to host the Summer Olympics three times (the other times being 1900 and 1924, marking a centenary since the latter). This is the first of any Olympic Games after the pandemic to allow spectators to attend. In a first, the opening ceremonies were staged outside the main stadium with the athletes parading down boats along the Seine River. Following this, the open water swimming competitions also occurred in the River.

===Future Games===

The 2028 Summer Olympics will be held in Los Angeles, California, United States, making it the third city to host the Games three times (the other times being 1932 and 1984), with the U.S. hosting the Summer Olympics for the fifth time.

The 2032 Summer Olympics will be held in Brisbane, Australia, which is the third city to host the Games in Australia and the fourth south of the equator.

==Sports==

There has been a total of 42 sports, spanning 55 disciplines, included in the Olympic programme at one point or another in the history of the Games. The schedule has comprised 33 sports for the recent Summer Olympics (2020), with 32 sports planned for the next Summer Olympics (2024).

The various Olympic Sports federations are grouped under a common umbrella association, called the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF).

===Qualification===
Qualification rules for each of the Olympic sports are set by the International Sports Federation (IF) that governs that sport&#x27;s international competition.

For individual sports, competitors typically qualify by attaining a certain place in a major international event or on the IF&#x27;s ranking list. There is a general rule that a maximum of three individual athletes may represent each nation per competition. National Olympic Committees (NOCs) may enter a limited number of qualified competitors in each event, and the NOC decides which qualified competitors to select as representatives in each event if more have attained the benchmark than can be entered.

Nations most often qualify teams for team sports through continental qualifying tournaments, in which each continental association is given a certain number of spots in the Olympic tournament. Each nation may be represented by no more than one team per competition; a team consists of just two people in some sports.

Some National Olympic Committees, whose nations are underrepresented after qualifications, may be granted wild card quotas, which are termed &quot;Universality Places&quot;, in some eligible sports.

===Popularity of Olympic sports===
The IOC divides Summer Olympic sports into five categories (A – E) based on popularity, gauged by six criteria: television viewing figures (40%), internet popularity (20%), public surveys (15%), ticket requests (10%), press coverage (10%), and number of national federations (5%). The category of a sport determines the share of Olympic revenue received by that sport&#x27;s International Federation. Sports that were new to the 2016 Olympics (rugby and golf) have been placed in Category E.

The current categories are:
Aquatics encompasses artistic swimming, diving, swimming, and water polo.

<text>Shareware is a type of proprietary software that is initially shared by the owner for trial use at little or no cost. Often the software has limited functionality or incomplete documentation until the user sends payment to the software developer. Shareware is often offered as a download from a website. Shareware differs from freeware, which is fully-featured software distributed at no cost to the user but without source code being made available; and free and open-source software, in which the source code is freely available for anyone to inspect and alter.

There are many types of shareware and, while they may not require an initial up-front payment, many are intended to generate revenue in one way or another. Some limit use to personal non-commercial purposes only, with purchase of a license required for use in a business enterprise. The software itself may be time-limited, or it may remind the user that payment would be appreciated.

== Types of shareware ==
=== Trialware ===
Trialware or is a program that limits the time that it can be effectively used, commonly via a built-in time limit, number of uses, or only allowing progression up to a certain point (e.g. in video games, see Game demo). The user can try out the fully featured program until the trial period is up, and then most trialware reverts to either a reduced-functionality (freemium, nagware, or crippleware) or non-functional mode, unless the user purchases a full version. Trialware has become normalized for online Software as a Service (SaaS). WinRAR is a notable example of an unlimited trialware, i.e. a program that retains its full functionality even after the trial period has ended.

The rationale behind trialware is to give potential users the opportunity to try out the program to judge its usefulness before purchasing a license. According to industry research firm Softletter, 66% of online companies surveyed had free-trial-to-paying-customer conversion rates of 25% or less. SaaS providers employ a wide range of strategies to nurture leads, and convert them into paying customers.

=== Freemium ===
Freemium works by offering a product or service free of charge (typically digital offerings such as software, content, games, web services or other) while charging a premium for advanced features, functionality, or related products and services. For example, a fully functional feature-limited version may be given away for free, with advanced features disabled until a license fee is paid. The word &quot;freemium&quot; combines the two aspects of the business model: &quot;free&quot; and &quot;premium&quot;. It has become a popular model especially in the antivirus industry.

=== Adware ===
Adware, short for &quot;advertising-supported software&quot;, is any software package which automatically renders advertisements in order to generate revenue for its author. Shareware is often packaged with adware to lower the shareware fees or eliminate the need to charge users a fee. The advertisements may take the form of a banner on an application window. The functions may be designed to analyze which websites the user visits and to present advertising pertinent to the types of goods or services featured there. The term is sometimes used to refer to software that displays unwanted advertisements, which typically are more intrusive and may appear as pop-ups, as is the case in most ad-oriented spyware. During the installation of the intended software, the user is presented with a requirement to agree to the terms of click through an end-user license agreement or similar licensing which governs the installation of the software.

=== Crippleware ===
Crippleware has vital features of the program, such as printing or the ability to save files, disabled or unwanted features like watermarks on screencasting and video editing software until the user buys the software. This allows users to take a close look at the features of a program without being able to use it to generate output. The distinction between freemium and crippleware is that an unlicensed freemium program has useful functionality, while crippleware demonstrates its potential but is not useful on its own.

=== Donationware ===
Donationware is a licensing model that supplies fully operational unrestricted software to the user and requests an optional donation be paid to the programmer or a third-party beneficiary (usually a non-profit). The amount of the donation may also be stipulated by the author, or it may be left to the discretion of the user, based on individual perceptions of the software&#x27;s value. Since donationware comes fully operational (i.e. not crippleware) with payment optional, it is a type of freeware. In some cases, there is a delay to start the program or &quot;nag screen&quot; reminding the user that they haven&#x27;t donated to the project. This nag feature and/or delayed start is often removed in an update once the user has donated to (paid for) the software.

=== Nagware ===
Nagware (also known as begware, annoyware or a nagscreen) is a pejorative term for shareware that persistently reminds the user to purchase a license. It usually does this by popping up a message when the user starts the program, or intermittently while the user is using the application. These messages can appear as windows obscuring part of the screen, or as message boxes that can quickly be closed. Some nagware keeps the message up for a certain time period, forcing the user to wait to continue to use the program. Unlicensed programs that support printing may superimpose a watermark on the printed output, typically stating that the output was produced by an unlicensed copy.

Some titles display a dialog box with payment information and a message that paying will remove the notice, which is usually displayed either upon startup or after an interval while the application is running. These notices are designed to annoy the user into paying.

=== Postcardware ===
Postcardware, also called just cardware, is a style of software distribution similar to shareware, distributed by the author on the condition that users send the author a postcard. A variation of cardware, emailware, uses the same approach but requires the user to send the author an email. Postcardware, like other novelty software distribution terms, is often not strictly enforced. Cardware is similar to beerware.

The concept was first used by Aaron Giles, author of JPEGView. Another well-known piece of postcardware is the roguelike game &quot;Ancient Domains of Mystery&quot;, whose author collects postcards from around the world. Orbitron is distributed as postcardware. Exifer is a popular application among digital photographers that has been postcardware. Caledos Automatic Wallpaper Changer is a &quot;still alive&quot; project cardware. &quot;Empathy&quot; is a postcardware for password-protected executables. Dual Module Player and Linux were also postcardware for a long time. An example for emailware is the video game &quot;Jump &#x27;n Bump&quot;. Another popular postcardware company is the Laravel package developers from Spatie, which has released over 200 open-source packages to the Laravel framework, which are postcardware licensed, and all shown at their website.

== History ==
In 1982, Andrew Fluegelman created a program for the IBM PC called PC-Talk, a telecommunications program, and used the term &quot;freeware&quot;; he described it &quot;as an experiment in economics more than altruism&quot;. About the same time, Jim &quot;Button&quot; Knopf released PC-File, a database program, calling it &quot;user-supported software&quot;. Not much later, Bob Wallace produced PC-Write, a word processor, and called it &quot;shareware&quot;. Appearing in an episode of &quot;Horizon&quot; titled &quot;Psychedelic Science&quot; originally broadcast 5 April 1998, Bob Wallace said the idea for shareware came to him &quot;to some extent as a result of my psychedelic experience&quot;.

In 1983 Jerry Pournelle wrote of &quot;an increasingly popular variant&quot; of free software &quot;that has no name, but works thus: &#x27;If you like this, send me (the author) some money. I prefer cash. In 1984, &quot;Softalk-PC&quot; magazine had a column, &quot;The Public Library&quot;, about such software. &quot;Public domain&quot; is a misnomer for shareware, and &quot;Freeware&quot; was trademarked by Fluegelman and could not be used legally by others, and &quot;User-Supported Software&quot; was too cumbersome. So columnist Nelson Ford had a contest to come up with a better name.

The most popular name submitted was &quot;Shareware&quot;, which was being used by Wallace. However, Wallace acknowledged that he got the term from an InfoWorld magazine column by that name in the 1970s, and that he considered the name to be generic, so its use became established over &quot;freeware&quot; and &quot;user-supported software&quot;.

Fluegelman, Knopf, and Wallace clearly established shareware as a viable software distribution model by becoming wealthy.

Prior to the popularity of the World Wide Web and widespread Internet access, shareware was often the only economical way for independent software authors to get their product onto users&#x27; desktops. Those with Internet or BBS access could download software and distribute it amongst their friends or user groups, who would then be encouraged to send the registration fee to the author, usually via postal mail. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, shareware software was widely distributed over online services, bulletin board systems and on diskettes. Contrary to commercial developers who spent millions of dollars urging users &quot;Don&#x27;t Copy That Floppy&quot;, shareware developers encouraged users to upload the software and share it on disks.

Commercial shareware distributors such as Educorp and Public Domain Inc printed catalogs describing thousands of public domain and shareware programs that were available for a small charge on floppy disk. These companies later made their entire catalog available on CD-ROM. One such distributor, &quot;Public Software Library&quot; (PSL), began an order-taking service for programmers who otherwise had no means of accepting credit card orders. Meanwhile major online service provider CompuServe enabled people to pay (register) for software using their CompuServe accounts. When AOL bought out CompuServe, that part of CompuServe called SWREG (Shareware Registration) was sold to UK businessman Stephen Lee of Atlantic Coast PLC who placed the service on to the internet and enabled over 3,000 independent software developers to use SWREG as a back office to accept various payment methods including credit, debit and charge cards, Paypal and other services in multiple currencies. This worked in realtime so that a client could pay for software and instantly download it which was novel at the time. SWREG was eventually bought by Digital River, Inc. Also, services like Kagi started offering applications that authors could distribute along with their products that would present the user with an onscreen form to fill out, print, and mail along with their payment. Once telecommunications became more widespread, this service also expanded online. Toward the beginning of the Internet era, books compiling reviews of available shareware were published, sometimes targeting specific niches such as small business. These books would typically come with one or more floppy disks or CD-ROMs containing software from the book.

As Internet use grew, users turned to downloading shareware programs from FTP or web sites. This spelled the end of bulletin board systems and shareware disk distributors. At first, disk space on a server was hard to come by, so networks like Info-Mac were developed, consisting of non-profit mirror sites hosting large shareware libraries accessible via the web or ftp. With the advent of the commercial web hosting industry, the authors of shareware programs started their own sites where the public could learn about their programs and download the latest versions, and even pay for the software online. This erased one of the chief distinctions of shareware, as it was now most often downloaded from a central &quot;official&quot; location instead of being shared samizdat-style by its users. To ensure users would get the latest bug-fixes as well as an install untainted by viruses or other malware, some authors discouraged users from giving the software to their friends, encouraging them to send a link instead.

Major download sites such as VersionTracker and CNet&#x27;s Download.com began to rank titles based on quality, feedback, and downloads. Popular software was sorted to the top of the list, along with products whose authors paid for preferred placement.

== Registration ==
If features are disabled in the freely accessible version, paying may provide the user with a license key or code they can enter into the software to disable the notices and enable full functionality. Some pirate web sites publish license codes for popular shareware, leading to a kind of arms race between the developer and the pirates where the developer disables pirated codes and the pirates attempt to find or generate new ones. Some software publishers have started accepting known pirated codes, using the opportunity to educate users on the economics of the shareware model.

Some shareware relies entirely on the user&#x27;s honesty and requires no password. Simply checking an &quot;I have paid&quot; checkbox in the application is all that is required to disable the registration notices.

== Games ==

In the early 1990s, shareware distribution was a popular method of publishing games for smaller developers, including then-fledgling companies Apogee Software (also known as 3D Realms), Epic MegaGames (now Epic Games), Ambrosia Software and id Software. It gave consumers the chance to play the game before investing money in it, and it gave them exposure that some products would be unable to get in the retail space.

With the Kroz series, Apogee introduced the &quot;episodic&quot; shareware model that became the most popular incentive for buying a game. While the shareware game would be a truly complete game, there would be additional &quot;episodes&quot; of the game that were not shareware and could only be legally obtained by paying for the shareware episode. In some cases these episodes were neatly integrated and would feel like a longer version of the game, and in other cases the later episodes would be stand-alone games. Sometimes the additional content was completely integrated with the unregistered game, such as in Ambrosia&#x27;s &quot;Escape Velocity&quot; series, in which a character representing the developer&#x27;s pet parrot, equipped with an undefeatable ship, would periodically harass and destroy the player after they reached a certain level representing the end of the trial period.

Racks of games on single 5 1/4-inch and later 3.5-inch floppy disks were common in retail stores. However, computer shows and bulletin board systems (BBS) such as Software Creations BBS were the primary distributors of low-cost software. Free software from a BBS was the motivating force for consumers to purchase a computer equipped with a modem, so as to acquire software at no cost. The success of shareware games, including id Software hits &quot;Commander Keen&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot;, depended in part on the BBS community&#x27;s willingness to redistribute them from one BBS to another across North America. The reasons for redistribution included allowing modem users who could not afford long-distance calls the opportunity to view the games.

The important distinguishing feature between a shareware game and a game demo is that the shareware game is (at least in theory) a complete working software program albeit with reduced content compared to the full game, while a game demo omits significant functionality as well as content. Shareware games commonly offered both single player and multiplayer modes plus a significant fraction of the full game content such as the first of three episodes, while some even offered the entire product as shareware while unlocking additional content for registered users. By contrast a game demo may offer as little as one single-player level or consist solely of a multiplayer map, this makes them easier to prepare than a shareware game.

== Industry standards and technologies ==
There are several widely accepted standards and technologies that are used in the development and promotion of shareware.
*FILE_ID.DIZ is a descriptive text file often included in downloadable shareware distribution packages.
*Portable Application Description (PAD) is used to standardize shareware application descriptions. PAD file is an XML document that describes a shareware or freeware product according to the PAD specification.
*DynamicPAD extends the Portable Application Description (PAD) standard by allowing shareware vendors to provide customized PAD XML files to each download site or any other PAD-enabled resource. DynamicPAD is a set of server-side PHP scripts distributed under a GPL license and a freeware DynamicPAD builder for 32-bit Windows. The primary way to consume or submit a DynamicPAD file is through the RoboSoft application by Rudenko Software, the DynamicPAD author. DynamicPAD is available at the DynamicPAD web site.
*Code signing is a technology that is used by developers to digitally sign their products. Versions of Microsoft Windows since Windows XP Service Pack 2 show a warning when the user installs unsigned software. This is typically offered as a security measure to prevent untrusted software from potentially infecting the machine with malware. However, critics see this technology as part of a tactic to delegitimize independent software development by requiring hefty upfront fees and a review process before software can be distributed.

<doc id="27568" wikidata="Q378078" url="?curid=27568" title="Substance theory">
<text>Substance theory, or substance–attribute theory, is an ontological theory positing that objects are constituted each by a &quot;substance&quot; and properties borne by the substance but distinct from it. In this role, a substance can be referred to as a &quot;substratum&quot; or a &quot;thing-in-itself&quot;. &quot;Substances&quot; are particulars that are ontologically independent: they are able to exist all by themselves. Another defining feature often attributed to substances is their ability to &quot;undergo changes&quot;. Changes involve something existing &quot;before&quot;, &quot;during&quot; and &quot;after&quot; the change. They can be described in terms of a persisting substance gaining or losing properties. &quot;Attributes&quot; or &quot;properties&quot;, on the other hand, are entities that can be exemplified by substances. Properties characterize their bearers; they express what their bearer is like.

&quot;Substance&quot; is a key concept in ontology, the latter in turn part of metaphysics, which may be classified into monist, dualist, or pluralist varieties according to how many substances or individuals are said to populate, furnish, or exist in the world. According to monistic views, there is only one substance. Stoicism and Spinoza, for example, hold monistic views, that pneuma or God, respectively, is the one substance in the world. These modes of thinking are sometimes associated with the idea of immanence. Dualism sees the world as being composed of two fundamental substances (for example, the Cartesian substance dualism of mind and matter). Pluralist philosophies include Plato&#x27;s Theory of Forms and Aristotle&#x27;s hylomorphic categories.

==Ancient Greek philosophy==
===Aristotle===

Aristotle used the term &quot;substance&quot; ( &quot;ousia&quot;) in a secondary sense for genera and species understood as hylomorphic forms. Primarily, however, he used it with regard to his category of substance, the specimen (&quot;this person&quot; or &quot;this horse&quot;) or individual, &quot;qua&quot; individual, who survives accidental change and in whom the essential properties inhere that define those universals.

In chapter 6 of book I the &quot;Physics&quot; Aristotle argues that any change must be analysed in reference to the property of an invariant subject: as it was before the change and thereafter. Thus, in his hylomorphic account of change, &quot;matter&quot; serves as a relative substratum of transformation, i.e., of changing (substantial) form. In the &quot;Categories&quot;, properties are predicated only of substance, but in chapter 7 of book I of the &quot;Physics&quot;, Aristotle discusses substances coming to be and passing away in the &quot;unqualified sense&quot; wherein primary substances (πρῶται οὐσίαι; &quot;Categories&quot; 2a35) are generated from (or perish into) a material substratum by having gained (or lost) the essential property that formally defines substances of that kind (in the secondary sense). Examples of such a substantial change include not only conception and dying, but also metabolism, e.g., the bread a man eats becomes the man. On the other hand, in accidental change, because the essential property remains unchanged, by identifying the substance with its formal essence, substance may thereby serve as the relative subject matter or property-bearer of change in a qualified sense (i.e., barring matters of life or death). An example of this sort of accidental change is a change of color or size: a tomato becomes red, or a juvenile horse grows.

Aristotle thinks that in addition to primary substances (which are particulars), there are secondary substances (δεύτεραι οὐσίαι), which are universals (&quot;Categories&quot; 2a11–a18).

However, according to Aristotle&#x27;s theology, a form of invariant form exists without matter, beyond the cosmos, powerless and oblivious, in the eternal substance of the unmoved movers.

===Pyrrhonism===
Early Pyrrhonism rejected the idea that substances exist. Pyrrho put this as:

&quot;Whoever wants to live well (eudaimonia) must consider these three questions: First, how are &quot;pragmata&quot; (ethical matters, affairs, topics) by nature? Secondly, what attitude should we adopt towards them? Thirdly, what will be the outcome for those who have this attitude?&quot; Pyrrho&#x27;s answer is that &quot;As for &quot;pragmata&quot; they are all adiaphora (undifferentiated by a logical differentia), &quot;astathmēta&quot; (unstable, unbalanced, not measurable), and &quot;anepikrita&quot; (unjudged, unfixed, undecidable). Therefore, neither our sense-perceptions nor our &quot;doxai&quot; (views, theories, beliefs) tell us the truth or lie; so we certainly should not rely on them. Rather, we should be &quot;adoxastoi&quot; (without views), &quot;aklineis&quot; (uninclined toward this side or that), and &quot;akradantoi&quot; (unwavering in our refusal to choose), saying about every single one that it no more is than it is not or it both is and is not or it neither is nor is not.

===Stoicism===

The Stoics rejected the idea that incorporeal beings inhere in matter, as taught by Plato. They believed that all being is corporeal infused with a creative fire called pneuma. Thus they developed a scheme of categories different from Aristotle&#x27;s based on the ideas of Anaxagoras and Timaeus. The fundamental basis of Stoicism in this context was a universally consistent ethical and moral code that should be maintained at all time, the physical belief of beings as matter is an important philosophical footnote, as it marked the start of thinking as beings as inherently linked to reality, instead of to some abstract heaven.

===Neoplatonism===
Neoplatonists argue that beneath the surface phenomena that present themselves to our senses are three higher spiritual principles or hypostases, each one more sublime than the preceding. For Plotinus, these are the soul or world-soul, being/intellect or divine mind (&quot;nous&quot;), and &quot;the one&quot;.

==Early modern philosophy==
René Descartes means by a substance an entity which exists in such a way that it needs no other entity in order to exist. Therefore, only God is a substance in this strict sense. However, he extends the term to created things, which need only the concurrence of God to exist. He maintained that two of these are mind and body, each being distinct from the other in their attributes and therefore in their essence, and neither needing the other in order to exist. This is Descartes&#x27; substance dualism.

Baruch Spinoza denied Descartes&#x27; &quot;real distinction&quot; between mind and matter. Substance, according to Spinoza, is one and indivisible, but has multiple &quot;attributes&quot;. He regards an attribute, though, as &quot;what we conceive as constituting the [single] essence of substance&quot;. The single essence of one substance can be conceived of as material and also, consistently, as mental. What is ordinarily called the natural world, together with all the individuals in it, is immanent in God: hence his famous phrase &quot;deus sive natura&quot; (&quot;God or Nature&quot;).

John Locke views substance through a corpuscularian lens where it exhibits two types of qualities which both stem from a source. He believes that humans are born &quot;tabula rasa&quot; or &quot;blank slate&quot; – without innate knowledge. In &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; Locke writes that &quot;first essence may be taken for the very being of anything, whereby it is, what it is.&quot; If humans are born without any knowledge, the way to receive knowledge is through perception of a certain object. But, according to Locke, an object exists in its primary qualities, no matter whether the human perceives it or not; it just exists. For example, an apple has qualities or properties that determine its existence apart from human perception of it, such as its mass or texture. The apple itself is also &quot;pure substance in which is supposed to provide some sort of &#x27;unknown support&#x27; to the observable qualities of things&quot; that the human mind perceives. The foundational or support qualities are called primary essences which &quot;in the case of physical substances, are the underlying physical causes of the object&#x27;s observable qualities&quot;. But then what is an object except &quot;the owner or support of other properties&quot;? Locke rejects Aristotle&#x27;s category of the forms, and develops mixed ideas about what substance or &quot;first essence&quot; means. Locke&#x27;s solution to confusion about first essence is to argue that objects simply are what they are – made up of microscopic particles existing because they exist. According to Locke, the mind cannot completely grasp the idea of a substance as it &quot;always falls beyond knowledge&quot;. There is a gap between what first essence truly means and the mind&#x27;s perception of it that Locke believes the mind cannot bridge, objects in their primary qualities must exist apart from human perception.

The molecular combination of atoms in first essence then forms the solid base that humans can perceive and add qualities to describe - the only way humans can possibly begin to perceive an object. The way to perceive the qualities of an apple is from the combination of the primary qualities to form the secondary qualities. These qualities are then used to group the substances into different categories that &quot;depend on the properties [humans] happen to be able to perceive&quot;. The taste of an apple or the feeling of its smoothness are not traits inherent to the fruit but are the power of the primary qualities to produce an idea about that object in the mind. The reason that humans can not sense the actual primary qualities is the mental distance from the object; thus, Locke argues, objects remain nominal for humans. Therefore, the argument then returns to how &quot;a philosopher has no other idea of those substances than what is framed by a collection of those simple ideas which are found in them.&quot; The mind&#x27;s conception of substances &quot;[is] complex rather than simple&quot; and &quot;has no (supposedly innate) clear and distinct idea of matter that can be revealed through intellectual abstraction away from sensory qualities&quot;.

The last quality of substance is the way the perceived qualities seem to begin to change – such as a candle melting; this quality is called the tertiary quality. Tertiary qualities &quot;of a body are those powers in it that, by virtue of its primary qualities, give it the power to produce observable changes in the primary qualities of other bodies&quot;; &quot;the power of the sun to melt wax is a tertiary quality of the sun&quot;. They are &quot;mere powers; qualities such as flexibility, ductility; and the power of sun to melt wax&quot;. This goes along with &quot;passive power: the capacity a thing has for being changed by another thing&quot;. In any object, at the core are the primary qualities (unknowable by the human mind), the secondary quality (how primary qualities are perceived), and tertiary qualities (the power of the combined qualities to make a change to the object itself or to other objects).

Robert Boyle&#x27;s corpuscularian hypothesis states that &quot;all material bodies are composites of ultimately small particles of matter&quot; that &quot;have the same material qualities as the larger composite bodies do&quot;. Using this basis, Locke defines his first group, primary qualities, as &quot;the ones that a body doesn&#x27;t lose, however much it alters.&quot; The materials retain their primary qualities even if they are broken down because of the unchanging nature of their atomic particles. If someone is curious about an object and they say it is solid and extended, these two descriptors are primary qualities. The second group consists of secondary qualities which are &quot;really nothing but the powers to produce various sensations in us by their primary qualities.&quot; Locke argues that the impressions our senses perceive from the objects (i.e. taste, sounds, colors, etc.) are not natural properties of the object itself, but things they induce in us by means of the &quot;size, shape, texture, and motion of their imperceptible parts.&quot; The bodies send insensible particles to our senses which let us perceive the object through different faculties; what we perceive is based on the object&#x27;s composition. With these qualities, people can achieve the object through bringing &quot;co-existing powers and sensible qualities to a common ground for explanation&quot;. Locke supposes that one wants to know what &quot;binds these qualities&quot; into an object, and argues that a &quot;substratum&quot; or &quot;substance&quot; has this effect, defining &quot;substance&quot; as follows:

This substratum is a construct of the mind in an attempt to bind all the qualities seen together; it is only &quot;a supposition of
an unknown support of qualities that are able to cause simple
ideas in us.&quot; Without making a substratum, people would be at a loss as to how different qualities relate. Locke does, however, mention that this substratum is an unknown, relating it to the story of the world on the turtle&#x27;s back and how the believers eventually had to concede that the turtle just rested on &quot;something he knew not what&quot;. This is how the mind perceives all things and from which it can make ideas about them; it is entirely relative, but it does provide a &quot;regularity and consistency to our ideas&quot;. Substance, overall, has two sets of qualities — those that define it, and those related to how we perceive it. These qualities rush to our minds, which must organize them. As a result, our mind creates a substratum (or &quot;substance&quot;) for these objects, into which it groups related qualities.

== Criticism of soul as substance ==
Kant observed that the assertion of a spiritual soul as substance could be a synthetic proposition which, however, was unproved and completely arbitrary. Introspection does not reveal any diachronic substrate remaining unchanged throughout life. The temporal structure of consciousness is retentive-perceptive-prognostic. The selfhood arises as result of several informative flows: (1) signals from our own body; (2) retrieved memories and forecasts; (3) the affective load: dispositions and aversions; (4) reflections in other minds. Mental acts have the feature of appropriation: they are always attached to some pre-reflective consciousness. As visual perception is only possible from a definite point of view, so inner experience is given together with self-consciousness. The latter is not an autonomous mental act, but a formal way how the first person has their experience. From the pre-reflective consciousness, the person gains conviction of their existence. This conviction is immune to false reference. The concept of person is prior to the concepts of subject and body. The reflective self-consciousness is a conceptual and elaborate cognition. Selfhood is a self-constituting effigy, a task to be accomplished. Humans are incapable of comprising all their experience within the current state of consciousness; overlapping memories are critical for personal integrity. Appropriated experience can be recollected. At stage B, we remember the experience of stage A; at stage C, we may be aware of the mental acts of stage B. The idea of self-identity is enforced by the relatively slow changes of our body and social situation. Personal identity may be explained without accepting a spiritual agent as subject of mental activity. Associative connection between life episodes is necessary and sufficient for the maintenance of a united selfhood. Personal character and memories can persist after radical mutation of the body.

==Irreducible concepts==

Two irreducible concepts encountered in substance theory are the &quot;bare particular&quot; and &quot;inherence&quot;.

===Bare particular===
In substance theory, a bare particular of an object is the element without which the object would not exist, that is, its substance, which exists independently from its properties, even if it is impossible for it to lack properties entirely. It is &quot;bare&quot; because it is considered without its properties and &quot;particular&quot; because it is not abstract. The properties that the substance has are said to inhere in the substance.

===Inherence===
Another primitive concept in substance theory is the inherence of properties within a substance. For example, in the sentence, &quot;The apple is red&quot; substance theory says that red inheres in the apple. Substance theory takes the meaning of an apple having the property of redness to be understood, and likewise that of a property&#x27;s inherence in substance, which is similar to, but not identical with, being part of the substance.

The inverse relation is participation. Thus in the example above, just as red inheres in the apple, so the apple participates in red.

==Arguments supporting the theory==
Two common arguments supporting substance theory are the argument from grammar and the argument from conception.

===Argument from grammar===
The argument from grammar uses traditional grammar to support substance theory. For example, the sentence &quot;Snow is white&quot; contains a grammatical subject &quot;snow&quot; and the predicate &quot;is white&quot;, thereby asserting &quot;snow is white&quot;. The argument holds that it makes no grammatical sense to speak of &quot;whiteness&quot; disembodied, without asserting that snow or something else &quot;is&quot; white. Meaningful assertions are formed by virtue of a grammatical subject, of which properties may be predicated, and in substance theory, such assertions are made with regard to a substance.

Bundle theory rejects the argument from grammar on the basis that a grammatical subject does not necessarily refer to a metaphysical subject. Bundle theory, for example, maintains that the grammatical subject of a statement refers to its properties. For example, a bundle theorist understands the grammatical subject of the sentence, &quot;Snow is white&quot;, to be a bundle of properties such as white. Accordingly, one can make meaningful statements about bodies without referring to substances.

===Argument from conception===
Another argument for the substance theory is the argument from conception. The argument claims that in order to conceive of an object&#x27;s properties, like the redness of an apple, one must conceive of the object that has those properties. According to the argument, one cannot conceive of redness, or any other property, distinct from the substance that has that property.

==Criticism==

The idea of substance was famously critiqued by David Hume, who held that since substance cannot be perceived, it should not be assumed to independently exist.

Friedrich Nietzsche, and after him Martin Heidegger, Michel Foucault and Gilles Deleuze also rejected the notion of &quot;substance&quot;, and in the same movement the concept of subject - seeing both concepts as holdovers from Platonic idealism. For this reason, Althusser&#x27;s &quot;anti-humanism&quot; and Foucault&#x27;s statements were criticized, by Jürgen Habermas and others, for misunderstanding that this led to a fatalist conception of social determinism. For Habermas, only a subjective form of liberty could be conceived, to the contrary of Deleuze who talks about &quot;&quot;a&quot; life&quot;, as an impersonal and immanent form of liberty.

For Heidegger, Descartes means by &quot;substance&quot; that by which &quot;we can understand nothing else than an entity which &quot;is&quot; in such a way that it need no other entity in order to &quot;be&quot;.&quot; Therefore, only God is a substance as &quot;Ens perfectissimus&quot; (most perfect being). Heidegger showed the inextricable relationship between the concept of substance and of subject, which explains why, instead of talking about &quot;man&quot; or &quot;humankind&quot;, he speaks about the &quot;Dasein&quot;, which is not a simple subject, nor a substance.

Alfred North Whitehead has argued that the concept of substance has only a limited applicability in everyday life and that metaphysics should rely upon the concept of process.

Roman Catholic theologian Karl Rahner, as part of his critique of transubstantiation, rejected substance theory and instead proposed the doctrine of &quot;transfinalization&quot;, which he felt was more attuned to modern philosophy. However, this doctrine was rejected by Pope Paul VI in his encyclical &quot;Mysterium fidei&quot;.

The 20th century Australian philosopher Colin Murray Turbayne also raised fundamental objections to the concepts of &quot;substance&quot; and &quot;substratum&quot;, arguing that both have little if any meaning at best. In Turbayne&#x27;s view, such concepts are more properly described as linguistic metaphors which served as the foundation for the physicalist and mechanistic theories of the universe proposed by Isaac Newton and the mind-body dualism put forth by René Descartes. Turbayne contends mankind has fallen victim over the course of time to such metaphors by misinterpreting them as examples of literal truth and subsequently utilizing deductive reasoning to incorporate them into the development of modern scientific hypotheses. He concludes that mankind can successfully embrace more beneficial theoretic constructs of the universe only after first acknowledging the metaphorical nature of these two concepts and the central role which they have assumed in the guise of literal truth within the realm of epistemology and metaphysics.

==Bundle theory==
In direct opposition to substance theory is bundle theory, whose most basic premise is that all concrete particulars are merely constructions or &#x27;bundles&#x27; of attributes or qualitative properties:

:Necessarily, for any concrete entity, formula_1, if for any entity, formula_2, formula_2 is a constituent of formula_1, then formula_2 is an attribute.

The bundle theorist&#x27;s principal objections to substance theory concern the bare particulars of a substance, which substance theory considers independently of the substance&#x27;s properties. The bundle theorist objects to the notion of a thing with no properties, claiming that such a thing is inconceivable and citing John Locke, who described a substance as &quot;a something, I know not what.&quot; To the bundle theorist, as soon as one has any notion of a substance in mind, a property accompanies that notion.
===Identity of indiscernibles counterargument===

The indiscernibility argument from the substance theorist targets those bundle theorists who are also metaphysical realists. Metaphysical realism uses the identity of &quot;universals&quot; to compare and identify particulars. Substance theorists say that bundle theory is incompatible with metaphysical realism due to the identity of indiscernibles: particulars may differ from one another only with respect to their attributes or relations.

The substance theorist&#x27;s indiscernibility argument against the metaphysically realistic bundle theorist states that numerically different concrete particulars are discernible from the self-same concrete particular only by virtue of qualitatively different attributes.

:Necessarily, for any complex objects, formula_1 and formula_2, if for any entity, formula_8, formula_8 is a constituent of formula_1 if and only if formula_8 is a constituent of formula_2, then formula_1 is numerically identical with formula_2.

The indiscernibility argument points out that if bundle theory and discernible concrete particulars theory explain the relationship between attributes, then the identity of indiscernibles theory must also be true:
:Necessarily, for any concrete objects, formula_1 and formula_2, if for any attribute, Φ, Φ is an attribute of formula_1 if and only if Φ is an attribute of formula_2, then formula_1 is numerically identical with formula_2.

The indiscernibles argument then asserts that the identity of indiscernibles is violated, for example, by identical sheets of paper. All of their qualitative properties are the same (e.g. white, rectangular, 9 x 11 inches...) and thus, the argument claims, bundle theory and metaphysical realism cannot both be correct.

However, bundle theory combined with trope theory (as opposed to metaphysical realism) avoids the indiscernibles argument because each attribute is a trope if can only be held by only one concrete particular.

The argument does not consider whether &quot;position&quot; should be considered an attribute or relation. It is after all through the differing positions that we in practice differentiate between otherwise identical pieces of paper.

==Religious philosophy==
===Christianity===
The Christian writers of antiquity adhered to the Aristotelian conception of substance. Their peculiarity was the use of this idea for the discernment of theological nuances. Clement of Alexandria considered both material and spiritual substances: blood and milk; mind and soul, respectively. Origen may be the first theologian expressing Christ&#x27;s similarity with the Father as consubstantiality. Tertullian professed the same view in the West. The ecclesiastics of the Cappadocian group (Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa) taught that the Trinity had a single substance in three hypostases individualized by the relations among them. In later ages, the meaning of &quot;substance&quot; became more important because of the dogma of the Eucharist. Hildebert of Lavardin, archbishop of Tours, introduced the term &quot;transubstantiation&quot; about 1080; its use spread after the Fourth Council of the Lateran in 1215.

According to Thomas Aquinas, beings may possess substance in three different modes. Together with other Medieval philosophers, he interpreted God&#x27;s epithet &quot;El Shaddai&quot; (Genesis 17:1) as self-sufficient and concluded that God&#x27;s essence was identical with existence. Aquinas also deemed the substance of spiritual creatures identical with their essence (or form); therefore he considered each angel to belong to its own distinct species. In Aquinas&#x27; view, composite substances consist of form and matter. Human substantial form, i.e. soul, receives its individuality from body.
===Jainism===

===Buddhism===

Buddhism rejects the concept of substance. Complex structures are comprehended as an aggregate of components without any essence. Just as the junction of parts is called cart, so the collections of elements are called things. All formations are unstable (&quot;aniccā&quot;) and lacking any constant core or &quot;self&quot; (&quot;anattā&quot;). Physical objects have no metaphysical substrate. Arising entities hang on previous ones conditionally: in the notable teaching on interdependent origination, effects arise not as caused by agents but conditioned by former situations. Our senses, perception, feelings, wishes and consciousness are flowing, the view &quot;satkāya-dṛṣṭi&quot; of their permanent carrier is rejected as fallacious. The school of Madhyamaka, namely Nāgārjuna, introduced the idea of the ontological void (&quot;śūnyatā&quot;). The Buddhist metaphysics Abhidharma presumes particular forces which determine the origin, persistence, aging and decay of everything in the world. Vasubandhu added a special force making a human, called &quot;&quot;aprāpti&quot; or &quot;pṛthagjanatvam&quot;&quot;. Because of the absence of a substantial soul, the belief in personal immortality loses foundation. Instead of deceased beings, new ones emerge whose fate is destined by the karmic law. The Buddha admitted the empirical identity of persons testified by their birth, name, and age. He approved the authorship of deeds and responsibility of performers. The disciplinary practice in the Sangha including reproaches, confession and expiation of transgressions, requires continuing personalities as its justification.

<doc id="27573" wikidata="Q7643352" url="?curid=27573" title="Superfluid helium-4">
<text>Superfluid helium-4 (helium II or He-II) is the superfluid form of helium-4, an isotope of the element helium. A superfluid is a state of matter in which matter behaves like a fluid with zero viscosity. The substance, which resembles other liquids such as helium I (conventional, non-superfluid liquid helium), flows without friction past any surface, which allows it to continue to circulate over obstructions and through pores in containers which hold it, subject only to its own inertia.

The formation of the superfluid is a manifestation of the formation of a Bose–Einstein condensate of helium atoms. This condensation occurs in liquid helium-4 at a far higher temperature (2.17 K) than it does in helium-3 (2.5 mK) because each atom of helium-4 is a boson particle, by virtue of its zero spin. Helium-3, however, is a fermion particle, which can form bosons only by pairing with itself at much lower temperatures, in a weaker process that is similar to the electron pairing in superconductivity.

== History ==
Known as a major facet in the study of quantum hydrodynamics and macroscopic quantum phenomena, the superfluidity effect was discovered by Pyotr Kapitsa and John F. Allen, and Don Misener in 1937. Onnes possibly observed the superfluid phase transition on August 2, 1911, the same day that he observed superconductivity in mercury. It has since been described through phenomenological and microscopic theories.

In the 1950s, Hall and Vinen performed experiments establishing the existence of quantized vortex lines in superfluid helium. In the 1960s, Rayfield and Reif established the existence of quantized vortex rings. Packard has observed the intersection of vortex lines with the free surface of the fluid,
and Avenel and Varoquaux have studied the Josephson effect in superfluid helium-4. In 2006, a group at the University of Maryland visualized quantized vortices by using small tracer particles of solid hydrogen.

In the early 2000s, physicists created a Fermionic condensate from pairs of ultra-cold fermionic atoms. Under certain conditions, fermion pairs form diatomic molecules and undergo Bose–Einstein condensation. At the other limit, the fermions (most notably superconducting electrons) form Cooper pairs which also exhibit superfluidity. This work with ultra-cold atomic gases has allowed scientists to study the region in between these two extremes, known as the BEC-BCS crossover.

Supersolids may also have been discovered in 2004 by physicists at Penn State University. When helium-4 is cooled below about 200 mK under high pressures, a fraction (≈1%) of the solid appears to become superfluid. By quench cooling or lengthening the annealing time, thus increasing or decreasing the defect density respectively, it was shown, via torsional oscillator experiment, that the supersolid fraction could be made to range from 20% to completely non-existent. This suggested that the supersolid nature of helium-4 is not intrinsic to helium-4 but a property of helium-4 and disorder. Some emerging theories posit that the supersolid signal observed in helium-4 was actually an observation of either a superglass state or intrinsically superfluid grain boundaries in the helium-4 crystal.

== Applications ==
Recently in the field of chemistry, superfluid helium-4 has been successfully used in spectroscopic techniques as a quantum solvent. Referred to as superfluid helium droplet spectroscopy (SHeDS), it is of great interest in studies of gas molecules, as a single molecule solvated in a superfluid medium allows a molecule to have effective rotational freedom, allowing it to behave similarly to how it would in the &quot;gas&quot; phase. Droplets of superfluid helium also have a characteristic temperature of about 0.4 K which cools the solvated molecule(s) to its ground or nearly ground rovibronic state.

Superfluids are also used in high-precision devices such as gyroscopes, which allow the measurement of some theoretically predicted gravitational effects (for an example, see Gravity Probe B).

The Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, launched in January 1983 to gather infrared data was cooled by 73 kilograms of superfluid helium, maintaining a temperature of . When used in conjunction with helium-3, temperatures as low as 40 mK are routinely achieved in extreme low temperature experiments. The helium-3, in liquid state at 3.2 K, can be evaporated into the superfluid helium-4, where it acts as a gas due to the latter&#x27;s properties as a Bose–Einstein condensate. This evaporation pulls energy from the overall system, which can be pumped out in a way completely analogous to normal refrigeration techniques. (See dilution refrigerator)

Superfluid-helium technology is used to extend the temperature range of cryocoolers to lower temperatures. So far the limit is 1.19 K, but there is a potential to reach 0.7 K.

== Properties ==

Superfluids, such as helium-4 below the lambda point (known, for simplicity, as helium II), exhibit many unusual properties. A superfluid acts as if it were a mixture of a normal component, with all the properties of a normal fluid, and a superfluid component. The superfluid component has zero viscosity and zero entropy. Application of heat to a spot in superfluid helium results in a flow of the normal component which takes care of the heat transport at relatively high velocity (up to 20 cm/s) which leads to a very high effective thermal conductivity.

=== Film flow ===

Many ordinary liquids, like alcohol or petroleum, creep up solid walls, driven by their surface tension. Liquid helium also has this property, but, in the case of He-II, the flow of the liquid in the layer is not restricted by its viscosity but by a critical velocity which is about 20 cm/s. This is a fairly high velocity so superfluid helium can flow relatively easily up the wall of containers, over the top, and down to the same level as the surface of the liquid inside the container, in a siphon effect. It was, however, observed, that the flow through nanoporous membrane becomes restricted if the pore diameter is less than 0.7 nm (i.e. roughly three times the classical diameter of helium atom), suggesting the unusual hydrodynamic properties of He arise at larger scale than in the classical liquid helium.

=== Rotation ===
Another fundamental property becomes visible if a superfluid is placed in a rotating container. Instead of rotating uniformly with the container, the rotating state consists of quantized vortices. That is, when the container is rotated at speeds below the first critical angular velocity, the liquid remains perfectly stationary. Once the first critical angular velocity is reached, the superfluid will form a vortex. The vortex strength is quantized, that is, a superfluid can only spin at certain &quot;allowed&quot; values. Rotation in a normal fluid, like water, is not quantized. If the rotation speed is increased more and more quantized vortices will be formed which arrange in nice patterns similar to the Abrikosov lattice in a superconductor.

=== Comparison with helium-3 ===
Although the phenomenologies of the superfluid states of helium-4 and helium-3 are very similar, the microscopic details of the transitions are very different. Helium-4 atoms are bosons, and their superfluidity can be understood in terms of the Bose–Einstein statistics that they obey. Specifically, the superfluidity of helium-4 can be regarded as a consequence of Bose–Einstein condensation in an interacting system. On the other hand, helium-3 atoms are fermions, and the superfluid transition in this system is described by a generalization of the BCS theory of superconductivity. In it, Cooper pairing takes place between atoms rather than electrons, and the attractive interaction between them is mediated by spin fluctuations rather than phonons. (See fermion condensate.) A unified description of superconductivity and superfluidity is possible in terms of gauge symmetry breaking.

=== Thermodynamics ===


Figure 1 is the phase diagram of 4He. It is a pressure-temperature (p-T) diagram indicating the solid and liquid regions separated by the melting curve (between the liquid and solid state) and the liquid and gas region, separated by the vapor-pressure line. This latter ends in the critical point where the difference between gas and liquid disappears. The diagram shows the remarkable property that 4He is liquid even at absolute zero. 4He is only solid at pressures above 25 bar.

Figure 1 also shows the λ-line. This is the line that separates two fluid regions in the phase diagram indicated by He-I and He-II. In the He-I region the helium behaves like a normal fluid; in the He-II region the helium is superfluid.

The name lambda-line comes from the specific heat – temperature plot which has the shape of the Greek letter λ. See figure 2, which shows a peak at 2.172 K, the so-called λ-point of 4He.

Below the lambda line the liquid can be described by the so-called two-fluid model. It behaves as if it consists of two components: a normal component, which behaves like a normal fluid, and a superfluid component with zero viscosity and zero entropy. The ratios of the respective densities ρn/ρ and ρs/ρ, with ρn (ρs) the density of the normal (superfluid) component, and ρ (the total density), depends on temperature and is represented in figure 3. By lowering the temperature, the fraction of the superfluid density increases from zero at &quot;T&quot;λ to one at zero kelvins. Below 1 K the helium is almost completely superfluid.

It is possible to create density waves of the normal component (and hence of the superfluid component since ρn + ρs = constant) which are similar to ordinary sound waves. This effect is called second sound. Due to the temperature dependence of ρn (figure 3) these waves in ρn are also temperature waves.

=== Superfluid hydrodynamics ===
The equation of motion for the superfluid component, in a somewhat simplified form, is given by Newton&#x27;s law

formula_1

The mass formula_2 is the molar mass of 4He, and formula_3 is the velocity of the superfluid component. The time derivative is the so-called hydrodynamic derivative, i.e. the rate of increase of the velocity when moving with the fluid. In the case of superfluid 4He in the gravitational field the force is given by

formula_4

In this expression formula_5 is the molar chemical potential, formula_6 the gravitational acceleration, and formula_7 the vertical coordinate. Thus we get the equation which states that the thermodynamics of a certain constant will be amplified by the force of the natural gravitational acceleration

Eq.  only holds if formula_8 is below a certain critical value, which usually is determined by the diameter of the flow channel.

In classical mechanics the force is often the gradient of a potential energy. Eq.  shows that, in the case of the superfluid component, the force contains a term due to the gradient of the chemical potential. This is the origin of the remarkable properties of He-II such as the fountain effect.

=== Fountain pressure ===
In order to rewrite Eq. in more familiar form we use the general formula

Here formula_9 is the molar entropy and formula_10 the molar volume. With Eq. formula_11 can be found by a line integration in the formula_12–formula_13 plane. First we integrate from the origin formula_14 to formula_15, so at formula_16. Next we integrate from formula_15 to formula_18, so with constant pressure (see figure 6). In the first integral formula_19 and in the second formula_20. With Eq. we obtain

We are interested only in cases where formula_12 is small so that formula_10 is practically constant. So

where formula_23 is the molar volume of the liquid at formula_16 and formula_25. The other term in Eq. is also written as a product of formula_23 and a quantity formula_27 which has the dimension of pressure

The pressure formula_28 is called the fountain pressure. It can be calculated from the entropy of 4He which, in turn, can be calculated from the heat capacity. For formula_29 the fountain pressure is equal to 0.692 bar. With a density of liquid helium of 125 kg/m3 and = 9.8 m/s2 this corresponds with a liquid-helium column of 56 meter height. So, in many experiments, the fountain pressure has a bigger effect on the motion of the superfluid helium than gravity.

With Eqs. and , Eq. obtains the form

Substitution of Eq. in gives

with formula_30 the density of liquid 4He at zero pressure and temperature.

Eq. shows that the superfluid component is accelerated by gradients in the pressure and in the gravitational field, as usual, but also by a gradient in the fountain pressure.

So far Eq. has only mathematical meaning, but in special experimental arrangements formula_28 can show up as a real pressure. Figure 7 shows two vessels both containing He-II. The left vessel is supposed to be at zero kelvins (formula_32) and zero pressure (formula_33). The vessels are connected by a so-called superleak. This is a tube, filled with a very fine powder, so the flow of the normal component is blocked. However, the superfluid component can flow through this superleak without any problem (below a critical velocity of about 20 cm/s). In the steady state formula_34 so Eq. implies

where the indexes formula_35 and formula_36 apply to the left and right side of the superleak respectively. In this particular case formula_33, formula_38, and formula_39 (since formula_40). Consequently,

formula_41

This means that the pressure in the right vessel is equal to the fountain pressure at formula_42.

In an experiment, arranged as in figure 8, a fountain can be created. The fountain effect is used to drive the circulation of 3He in dilution refrigerators.
=== Heat transport ===
Figure 9 depicts a heat-conduction experiment between two temperatures formula_43 and formula_44 connected by a tube filled with He-II. When heat is applied to the hot end a pressure builds up at the hot end according to Eq.. This pressure drives the normal component from the hot end to the cold end according to

Here formula_45 is the viscosity of the normal component, formula_46 some geometrical factor, and formula_47 the volume flow. The normal flow is balanced by a flow of the superfluid component from the cold to the hot end. At the end sections a normal to superfluid conversion takes place and vice versa. So heat is transported, not by heat conduction, but by convection. This kind of heat transport is very effective, so the thermal conductivity of He-II is very much better than the best materials. The situation is comparable with heat pipes where heat is transported via gas–liquid conversion. The high thermal conductivity of He-II is applied for stabilizing superconducting magnets such as in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

L. D. Landau&#x27;s phenomenological and semi-microscopic theory of superfluidity of helium-4 earned him the Nobel Prize in physics, in 1962. Assuming that sound waves are the most important excitations in helium-4 at low temperatures, he showed that helium-4 flowing past a wall would not spontaneously create excitations if the flow velocity was less than the sound velocity. In this model, the sound velocity is the &quot;critical velocity&quot; above which superfluidity is destroyed. (Helium-4 actually has a lower flow velocity than the sound velocity, but this model is useful to illustrate the concept.) Landau also showed that the sound wave and other excitations could equilibrate with one another and flow separately from the rest of the helium-4, which is known as the &quot;condensate&quot;.

From the momentum and flow velocity of the excitations he could then define a &quot;normal fluid&quot; density, which is zero at zero temperature and increases with temperature. At the so-called Lambda temperature, where the normal fluid density equals the total density, the helium-4 is no longer superfluid.

To explain the early specific heat data on superfluid helium-4, Landau posited the existence of a type of excitation he called a &quot;roton&quot;, but as better data became available he considered that the &quot;roton&quot; was the same as a high momentum version of sound.

The Landau theory does not elaborate on the microscopic structure of the superfluid component of liquid helium. The first attempts to create a microscopic theory of the superfluid component itself were done by London and subsequently, Tisza.
Other microscopical models have been proposed by different authors. Their main objective is to derive the form of the inter-particle potential between helium atoms in superfluid state from first principles of quantum mechanics.
To date, a number of models of this kind have been proposed, including: models with vortex rings, hard-sphere models, and Gaussian cluster theories.

=== Vortex ring model ===
Landau thought that vorticity entered superfluid helium-4 by vortex sheets, but such sheets have since been shown to be unstable.
Lars Onsager and, later independently, Feynman showed that vorticity enters by quantized vortex lines. They also developed the idea of quantum vortex rings.
Arie Bijl in the 1940s,
and Richard Feynman around 1955, developed microscopic theories for the roton, which was shortly observed with inelastic neutron experiments by Palevsky. Later on, Feynman admitted that his model gives only qualitative agreement with experiment.

=== Hard-sphere models ===
The models are based on the simplified form of the inter-particle potential between helium-4 atoms in the superfluid phase. Namely, the potential is assumed to be of the hard-sphere type.
In these models the famous Landau (roton) spectrum of excitations is qualitatively reproduced.

=== Gaussian cluster approach ===
This is a two-scale approach which describes the superfluid component of liquid helium-4. It
consists of two nested models linked via parametric space. The short-wavelength part describes the interior structure of the fluid element using a non-perturbative approach based on the logarithmic Schrödinger equation; it suggests the Gaussian-like behaviour of the element&#x27;s interior density and interparticle interaction potential. The long-wavelength part is the quantum many-body theory of such elements which deals with their dynamics and interactions. The approach provides a unified description of the phonon, maxon and roton excitations, and has noteworthy agreement with experiment: with one essential parameter to fit one reproduces at high accuracy the Landau roton spectrum, sound velocity and structure factor of superfluid helium-4. This model utilizes the general theory of quantum Bose liquids with logarithmic nonlinearities which is based on introducing a dissipative-type contribution to energy related to the quantum Everett–Hirschman entropy function.

<text>Simon Flexner (March 25, 1863 – May 2, 1946) was a physician, scientist, administrator, and professor of experimental pathology at the University of Pennsylvania (1899–1903). He served as the first director of the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (1901–1935) (later developed as Rockefeller University) and a trustee of the Rockefeller Foundation. He was also a friend and adviser to John D. Rockefeller Jr.

Among Flexner&#x27;s most important achievements are studies into poliomyelitis and the development of serum treatment for meningitis. Among his lab assistants were Hideyo Noguchi and Cornelius Rhoads, later directors of Memorial Hospital and the Sloan-Kettering Institute, respectively.

The bacteria species &quot;Shigella flexneri&quot; was named in recognition of Flexner. In addition, Flexner was the first to describe Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, a characteristic finding in retinoblastoma, a type of cancer.

==Early life and career==
Simon was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to Moritz (Morris) Flexner, a Jewish immigrant from Neumark, Bohemia, via several years in Strasbourg, France; and Ester from Roden, Germany. He was the fourth son of seven in a large family of nine children: Jacob, Henry, and Isadore; then Simon, followed by Bernard Flexner, Abraham Flexner, and Washington. The two sisters Mary and Gertrude were the youngest. Jacob became a pharmacist and physician, Bernard became a Zionist leader, and Abraham became an educator, eventually influencing the direction of medical education in the United States.

Simon first gained a degree from the Louisville College of Pharmacy and worked with his brother Jacob for eight years.

==Medical school and career==

He returned to college, getting his medical degree from Louisville Medical College in 1889. He did postgraduate work in pathology at Johns Hopkins University Medical School, and started teaching there. By 1899, he was a professor of pathology at the University of Pennsylvania.

Flexner was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1901.

He taught at Penn until 1903, but was called to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (later Rockefeller University), where he started serving as its first director in 1901. He managed the research institute until 1935. Through this affiliation and related work, he came to know the philanthropist John D. Rockefeller, who supported research and basic medical care.

In December 1907 Flexner declared in a reading of his paper on &quot;Tendencies in Pathology&quot; in the University of Chicago that it would be possible in the then-future for diseased human organs substitution for healthy ones by surgery—including arteries, stomach, kidneys and heart. These previsions became reality in the second half of the 20th century.
In 1911, Flexner was awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh.

From 1910 to 1914 he was a trustee of the Carnegie Institution.

==Marriage and family==
Simon Flexner married Helen Thomas (later professor of English) and had a family. His son James Thomas Flexner became a prolific writer; one of his works was an extensive biography of George Washington.

Simon Flexner died in May 1946 in New York City, from a myocardial infarction (heart attack). He was 83 years old. His papers are currently housed at the American Philosophical Society and the Becker Medical Library at the Washington University School of Medicine.

<text>Statistical regularity is a notion in statistics and probability theory that random events exhibit regularity when repeated enough times or that enough sufficiently similar random events exhibit regularity. It is an umbrella term that covers the law of large numbers, all central limit theorems and ergodic theorems.

If one throws a dice once, it is difficult to predict the outcome, but if one repeats this experiment many times, one will see that the number of times each result occurs divided by the number of throws will eventually stabilize towards a specific value.

Repeating a series of trials will produce similar, but not identical, results for each series: the average, the standard deviation and other distributional characteristics will be around the same for each series of trials.

The notion is used in games of chance, demographic statistics, quality control of a manufacturing process, and in many other parts of our lives.

Observations of this phenomenon provided the initial motivation for the concept of what is now known as frequency probability.

This phenomenon should not be confused with the gambler&#x27;s fallacy, because regularity only refers to the (possibly very) long run. The gambler&#x27;s fallacy does not apply to statistical regularity because the latter considers the whole rather than individual cases.

<text>A statistical model is a mathematical model that embodies a set of statistical assumptions concerning the generation of sample data (and similar data from a larger population). A statistical model represents, often in considerably idealized form, the data-generating process. When referring specifically to probabilities, the corresponding term is probabilistic model. All statistical hypothesis tests and all statistical estimators are derived via statistical models. More generally, statistical models are part of the foundation of statistical inference. A statistical model is usually specified as a mathematical relationship between one or more random variables and other non-random variables. As such, a statistical model is &quot;a formal representation of a theory&quot; (Herman Adèr quoting Kenneth Bollen).

==Introduction==
Informally, a statistical model can be thought of as a statistical assumption (or set of statistical assumptions) with a certain property: that the assumption allows us to calculate the probability of any event. As an example, consider a pair of ordinary six-sided dice. We will study two different statistical assumptions about the dice.

The first statistical assumption is this: for each of the dice, the probability of each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) coming up is . From that assumption, we can calculate the probability of both dice coming up 5:  More generally, we can calculate the probability of any event: e.g. (1 and 2) or (3 and 3) or (5 and 6). The alternative statistical assumption is this: for each of the dice, the probability of the face 5 coming up is (because the dice are weighted). From that assumption, we can calculate the probability of both dice coming up 5:  We cannot, however, calculate the probability of any other nontrivial event, as the probabilities of the other faces are unknown.

The first statistical assumption constitutes a statistical model: because with the assumption alone, we can calculate the probability of any event. The alternative statistical assumption does &quot;not&quot; constitute a statistical model: because with the assumption alone, we cannot calculate the probability of every event. In the example above, with the first assumption, calculating the probability of an event is easy. With some other examples, though, the calculation can be difficult, or even impractical (e.g. it might require millions of years of computation). For an assumption to constitute a statistical model, such difficulty is acceptable: doing the calculation does not need to be practicable, just theoretically possible.

==Formal definition==
In mathematical terms, a statistical model is a pair (formula_1), where formula_2 is the set of possible observations, i.e. the sample space, and formula_3 is a set of probability distributions on formula_2. The set formula_3 represents all of the models that are considered possible. This set is typically parameterized: formula_6. The set formula_7 defines the parameters of the model. If a parameterization is such that distinct parameter values give rise to distinct distributions, i.e. formula_8 (in other words, the mapping is injective), it is said to be &quot;identifiable&quot;.

In some cases, the model can be more complex.

* In Bayesian statistics, the model is extended by adding a probability distribution over the parameter space formula_7.
* A statistical model can sometimes distinguish two sets of probability distributions. The first set formula_10 is the set of models considered for inference. The second set formula_11 is the set of models that could have generated the data which is much larger than formula_12. Such statistical models are key in checking that a given procedure is robust, i.e. that it does not produce catastrophic errors when its assumptions about the data are incorrect.

==An example==
Suppose that we have a population of children, with the ages of the children distributed uniformly, in the population. The height of a child will be stochastically related to the age: e.g. when we know that a child is of age 7, this influences the chance of the child being 1.5 meters tall. We could formalize that relationship in a linear regression model, like this: 
height&quot;i&quot; = &quot;b&quot;0 + &quot;b&quot;1age&quot;i&quot; + ε&quot;i&quot;, where &quot;b&quot;0 is the intercept, &quot;b&quot;1 is a parameter that age is multiplied by to obtain a prediction of height, ε&quot;i&quot; is the error term, and &quot;i&quot; identifies the child. This implies that height is predicted by age, with some error.

An admissible model must be consistent with all the data points. Thus, a straight line (height&quot;i&quot; = &quot;b&quot;0 + &quot;b&quot;1age&quot;i&quot;) cannot be admissible for a model of the data—unless it exactly fits all the data points, i.e. all the data points lie perfectly on the line. The error term, ε&quot;i&quot;, must be included in the equation, so that the model is consistent with all the data points. To do statistical inference, we would first need to assume some probability distributions for the ε&quot;i&quot;. For instance, we might assume that the ε&quot;i&quot; distributions are i.i.d. Gaussian, with zero mean. In this instance, the model would have 3 parameters: &quot;b&quot;0, &quot;b&quot;1, and the variance of the Gaussian distribution. We can formally specify the model in the form (formula_1) as follows. The sample space, formula_2, of our model comprises the set of all possible pairs (age, height). Each possible value of formula_15 = (&quot;b&quot;0, &quot;b&quot;1, &quot;σ&quot;2) determines a distribution on formula_2; denote that distribution by formula_17. If formula_7 is the set of all possible values of formula_15, then formula_6. (The parameterization is identifiable, and this is easy to check.)

In this example, the model is determined by (1) specifying formula_2 and (2) making some assumptions relevant to formula_3. There are two assumptions: that height can be approximated by a linear function of age; that errors in the approximation are distributed as i.i.d. Gaussian. The assumptions are sufficient to specify formula_3—as they are required to do.

==General remarks==
A statistical model is a special class of mathematical model. What distinguishes a statistical model from other mathematical models is that a statistical model is non-deterministic. Thus, in a statistical model specified via mathematical equations, some of the variables do not have specific values, but instead have probability distributions; i.e. some of the variables are stochastic. In the above example with children&#x27;s heights, ε is a stochastic variable; without that stochastic variable, the model would be deterministic. Statistical models are often used even when the data-generating process being modeled is deterministic. For instance, coin tossing is, in principle, a deterministic process; yet it is commonly modeled as stochastic (via a Bernoulli process). Choosing an appropriate statistical model to represent a given data-generating process is sometimes extremely difficult, and may require knowledge of both the process and relevant statistical analyses. Relatedly, the statistician Sir David Cox has said, &quot;How [the] translation from subject-matter problem to statistical model is done is often the most critical part of an analysis&quot;.

There are three purposes for a statistical model, according to Konishi &amp; Kitagawa:
#Predictions
#Extraction of information
#Description of stochastic structures
Those three purposes are essentially the same as the three purposes indicated by Friendly &amp; Meyer: prediction, estimation, description.

==Dimension of a model==
Suppose that we have a statistical model (formula_1) with formula_6. In notation, we write that formula_26 where is a positive integer (formula_27 denotes the real numbers; other sets can be used, in principle). Here, is called the dimension of the model. The model is said to be &quot;parametric&quot; if formula_7 has finite dimension. As an example, if we assume that data arise from a univariate Gaussian distribution, then we are assuming that
:formula_29. 
In this example, the dimension, , equals 2. As another example, suppose that the data consists of points (, ) that we assume are distributed according to a straight line with i.i.d. Gaussian residuals (with zero mean): this leads to the same statistical model as was used in the example with children&#x27;s heights. The dimension of the statistical model is 3: the intercept of the line, the slope of the line, and the variance of the distribution of the residuals. (Note the set of all possible lines has dimension 2, even though geometrically, a line has dimension 1.)

Although formally formula_30 is a single parameter that has dimension , it is sometimes regarded as comprising separate parameters. For example, with the univariate Gaussian distribution, formula_15 is formally a single parameter with dimension 2, but it is often regarded as comprising 2 separate parameters—the mean and the standard deviation. A statistical model is &quot;nonparametric&quot; if the parameter set formula_7 is infinite dimensional. A statistical model is &quot;semiparametric&quot; if it has both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional parameters. Formally, if is the dimension of formula_7 and is the number of samples, both semiparametric and nonparametric models have formula_34 as formula_35. If formula_36 as formula_35, then the model is semiparametric; otherwise, the model is nonparametric.

Parametric models are by far the most commonly used statistical models. Regarding semiparametric and nonparametric models, Sir David Cox has said, &quot;These typically involve fewer assumptions of structure and distributional form but usually contain strong assumptions about independencies&quot;.

==Nested models==
Two statistical models are nested if the first model can be transformed into the second model by imposing constraints on the parameters of the first model. As an example, the set of all Gaussian distributions has, nested within it, the set of zero-mean Gaussian distributions: we constrain the mean in the set of all Gaussian distributions to get the zero-mean distributions. As a second example, the quadratic model 
has, nested within it, the linear model 
—we constrain the parameter to equal 0.

In both those examples, the first model has a higher dimension than the second model (for the first example, the zero-mean model has dimension 1). Such is often, but not always, the case. As an example where they have the same dimension, the set of positive-mean Gaussian distributions is nested within the set of all Gaussian distributions; they both have dimension 2.

==Comparing models==

Comparing statistical models is fundamental for much of statistical inference. state: &quot;The majority of the problems in statistical inference can be considered to be problems related to statistical modeling. They are typically formulated as comparisons of several statistical models.&quot; Common criteria for comparing models include the following: &quot;R&quot;2, Bayes factor, Akaike information criterion, and the likelihood-ratio test together with its generalization, the relative likelihood.

Another way of comparing two statistical models is through the notion of deficiency introduced by Lucien Le Cam.

<text>Statistical inference is the process of using data analysis to infer properties of an underlying probability distribution. Inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates. It is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population.

Inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. Descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population. In machine learning, the term &quot;inference&quot; is sometimes used instead to mean &quot;make a prediction, by evaluating an already trained model&quot;; in this context inferring properties of the model is referred to as &quot;training&quot; or &quot;learning&quot; (rather than &quot;inference&quot;), and using a model for prediction is referred to as &quot;inference&quot; (instead of &quot;prediction&quot;); see also predictive inference.

== Introduction ==
Statistical inference makes propositions about a population, using data drawn from the population with some form of sampling. Given a hypothesis about a population, for which we wish to draw inferences, statistical inference consists of (first) selecting a statistical model of the process that generates the data and (second) deducing propositions from the model.

Konishi and Kitagawa state &quot;The majority of the problems in statistical inference can be considered to be problems related to statistical modeling&quot;. Relatedly, Sir David Cox has said, &quot;How [the] translation from subject-matter problem to statistical model is done is often the most critical part of an analysis&quot;.

The conclusion of a statistical inference is a statistical proposition. Some common forms of statistical proposition are the following:
* a point estimate, i.e. a particular value that best approximates some parameter of interest;
* an interval estimate, e.g. a confidence interval (or set estimate), i.e. an interval constructed using a dataset drawn from a population so that, under repeated sampling of such datasets, such intervals would contain the true parameter value with the probability at the stated confidence level;
* a credible interval, i.e. a set of values containing, for example, 95% of posterior belief;
* rejection of a hypothesis;
* clustering or classification of data points into groups.

== Models and assumptions ==

Any statistical inference requires some assumptions. A statistical model is a set of assumptions concerning the generation of the observed data and similar data. Descriptions of statistical models usually emphasize the role of population quantities of interest, about which we wish to draw inference. Descriptive statistics are typically used as a preliminary step before more formal inferences are drawn.

=== Degree of models/assumptions ===
Statisticians distinguish between three levels of modeling assumptions:

* Fully parametric: The probability distributions describing the data-generation process are assumed to be fully described by a family of probability distributions involving only a finite number of unknown parameters. For example, one may assume that the distribution of population values is truly Normal, with unknown mean and variance, and that datasets are generated by &#x27;simple&#x27; random sampling. The family of generalized linear models is a widely used and flexible class of parametric models.
* Non-parametric: The assumptions made about the process generating the data are much less than in parametric statistics and may be minimal. For example, every continuous probability distribution has a median, which may be estimated using the sample median or the Hodges–Lehmann–Sen estimator, which has good properties when the data arise from simple random sampling.
* Semi-parametric: This term typically implies assumptions &#x27;in between&#x27; fully and non-parametric approaches. For example, one may assume that a population distribution has a finite mean. Furthermore, one may assume that the mean response level in the population depends in a truly linear manner on some covariate (a parametric assumption) but not make any parametric assumption describing the variance around that mean (i.e. about the presence or possible form of any heteroscedasticity). More generally, semi-parametric models can often be separated into &#x27;structural&#x27; and &#x27;random variation&#x27; components. One component is treated parametrically and the other non-parametrically. The well-known Cox model is a set of semi-parametric assumptions.

=== Importance of valid models/assumptions ===
Whatever level of assumption is made, correctly calibrated inference, in general, requires these assumptions to be correct; i.e. that the data-generating mechanisms really have been correctly specified.

Incorrect assumptions of &#x27;simple&#x27; random sampling can invalidate statistical inference. More complex semi- and fully parametric assumptions are also cause for concern. For example, incorrectly assuming the Cox model can in some cases lead to faulty conclusions. Incorrect assumptions of Normality in the population also invalidates some forms of regression-based inference. The use of any parametric model is viewed skeptically by most experts in sampling human populations: &quot;most sampling statisticians, when they deal with confidence intervals at all, limit themselves to statements about [estimators] based on very large samples, where the central limit theorem ensures that these [estimators] will have distributions that are nearly normal.&quot; In particular, a normal distribution &quot;would be a totally unrealistic and catastrophically unwise assumption to make if we were dealing with any kind of economic population.&quot; Here, the central limit theorem states that the distribution of the sample mean &quot;for very large samples&quot; is approximately normally distributed, if the distribution is not heavy-tailed.

====Approximate distributions====

Given the difficulty in specifying exact distributions of sample statistics, many methods have been developed for approximating these.

With finite samples, approximation results measure how close a limiting distribution approaches the statistic&#x27;s sample distribution: For example, with 10,000 independent samples the normal distribution approximates (to two digits of accuracy) the distribution of the sample mean for many population distributions, by the Berry–Esseen theorem. Yet for many practical purposes, the normal approximation provides a good approximation to the sample-mean&#x27;s distribution when there are 10 (or more) independent samples, according to simulation studies and statisticians&#x27; experience. Following Kolmogorov&#x27;s work in the 1950s, advanced statistics uses approximation theory and functional analysis to quantify the error of approximation. In this approach, the metric geometry of probability distributions is studied; this approach quantifies approximation error with, for example, the Kullback–Leibler divergence, Bregman divergence, and the Hellinger distance.

With indefinitely large samples, limiting results like the central limit theorem describe the sample statistic&#x27;s limiting distribution if one exists. Limiting results are not statements about finite samples, and indeed are irrelevant to finite samples. However, the asymptotic theory of limiting distributions is often invoked for work with finite samples. For example, limiting results are often invoked to justify the generalized method of moments and the use of generalized estimating equations, which are popular in econometrics and biostatistics. The magnitude of the difference between the limiting distribution and the true distribution (formally, the &#x27;error&#x27; of the approximation) can be assessed using simulation. The heuristic application of limiting results to finite samples is common practice in many applications, especially with low-dimensional models with log-concave likelihoods (such as with one-parameter exponential families).

===Randomization-based models===
For a given dataset that was produced by a randomization design, the randomization distribution of a statistic (under the null-hypothesis) is defined by evaluating the test statistic for all of the plans that could have been generated by the randomization design. In frequentist inference, the randomization allows inferences to be based on the randomization distribution rather than a subjective model, and this is important especially in survey sampling and design of experiments. Statistical inference from randomized studies is also more straightforward than many other situations. In Bayesian inference, randomization is also of importance: in survey sampling, use of sampling without replacement ensures the exchangeability of the sample with the population; in randomized experiments, randomization warrants a missing at random assumption for covariate information.

Objective randomization allows properly inductive procedures. Many statisticians prefer randomization-based analysis of data that was generated by well-defined randomization procedures. (However, it is true that in fields of science with developed theoretical knowledge and experimental control, randomized experiments may increase the costs of experimentation without improving the quality of inferences.) Similarly, results from randomized experiments are recommended by leading statistical authorities as allowing inferences with greater reliability than do observational studies of the same phenomena. However, a good observational study may be better than a bad randomized experiment.

The statistical analysis of a randomized experiment may be based on the randomization scheme stated in the experimental protocol and does not need a subjective model.

However, at any time, some hypotheses cannot be tested using objective statistical models, which accurately describe randomized experiments or random samples. In some cases, such randomized studies are uneconomical or unethical.

==== Model-based analysis of randomized experiments ====
It is standard practice to refer to a statistical model, e.g., a linear or logistic models, when analyzing data from randomized experiments. However, the randomization scheme guides the choice of a statistical model. It is not possible to choose an appropriate model without knowing the randomization scheme. Seriously misleading results can be obtained analyzing data from randomized experiments while ignoring the experimental protocol; common mistakes include forgetting the blocking used in an experiment and confusing repeated measurements on the same experimental unit with independent replicates of the treatment applied to different experimental units.

==== Model-free randomization inference ====
Model-free techniques provide a complement to model-based methods, which employ reductionist strategies of reality-simplification. The former combine, evolve, ensemble and train algorithms dynamically adapting to the contextual affinities of a process and learning the intrinsic characteristics of the observations.

For example, model-free simple linear regression is based either on:

* a &quot;random design&quot;, where the pairs of observations formula_1 are independent and identically distributed (iid),
* or a &quot;deterministic design&quot;, where the variables formula_2 are deterministic, but the corresponding response variables formula_3 are random and independent with a common conditional distribution, i.e., formula_4, which is independent of the index formula_5.

In either case, the model-free randomization inference for features of the common conditional distribution formula_6 relies on some regularity conditions, e.g. functional smoothness. For instance, model-free randomization inference for the population feature &quot;conditional mean&quot;, formula_7, can be consistently estimated via local averaging or local polynomial fitting, under the assumption that formula_8 is smooth. Also, relying on asymptotic normality or resampling, we can construct confidence intervals for the population feature, in this case, the &quot;conditional mean&quot;, formula_8.

== Paradigms for inference ==
Different schools of statistical inference have become established. These schools—or &quot;paradigms&quot;—are not mutually exclusive, and methods that work well under one paradigm often have attractive interpretations under other paradigms.

Bandyopadhyay and Forster describe four paradigms: The classical (or frequentist) paradigm, the Bayesian paradigm, the likelihoodist paradigm, and the Akaikean-Information Criterion-based paradigm.

=== Frequentist inference ===
This paradigm calibrates the plausibility of propositions by considering (notional) repeated sampling of a population distribution to produce datasets similar to the one at hand. By considering the dataset&#x27;s characteristics under repeated sampling, the frequentist properties of a statistical proposition can be quantified—although in practice this quantification may be challenging.

==== Examples of frequentist inference ====
* &quot;p&quot;-value
* Confidence interval
* Null hypothesis significance testing

==== Frequentist inference, objectivity, and decision theory ====
One interpretation of frequentist inference (or classical inference) is that it is applicable only in terms of frequency probability; that is, in terms of repeated sampling from a population. However, the approach of Neyman develops these procedures in terms of pre-experiment probabilities. That is, before undertaking an experiment, one decides on a rule for coming to a conclusion such that the probability of being correct is controlled in a suitable way: such a probability need not have a frequentist or repeated sampling interpretation. In contrast, Bayesian inference works in terms of conditional probabilities (i.e. probabilities conditional on the observed data), compared to the marginal (but conditioned on unknown parameters) probabilities used in the frequentist approach.

The frequentist procedures of significance testing and confidence intervals can be constructed without regard to utility functions. However, some elements of frequentist statistics, such as statistical decision theory, do incorporate utility functions. In particular, frequentist developments of optimal inference (such as minimum-variance unbiased estimators, or uniformly most powerful testing) make use of loss functions, which play the role of (negative) utility functions. Loss functions need not be explicitly stated for statistical theorists to prove that a statistical procedure has an optimality property. However, loss-functions are often useful for stating optimality properties: for example, median-unbiased estimators are optimal under absolute value loss functions, in that they minimize expected loss, and least squares estimators are optimal under squared error loss functions, in that they minimize expected loss.

While statisticians using frequentist inference must choose for themselves the parameters of interest, and the estimators/test statistic to be used, the absence of obviously explicit utilities and prior distributions has helped frequentist procedures to become widely viewed as &#x27;objective&#x27;.

===Bayesian inference===
The Bayesian calculus describes degrees of belief using the &#x27;language&#x27; of probability; beliefs are positive, integrate into one, and obey probability axioms. Bayesian inference uses the available posterior beliefs as the basis for making statistical propositions. There are several different justifications for using the Bayesian approach.

====Examples of Bayesian inference====
* Credible interval for interval estimation
* Bayes factors for model comparison

====Bayesian inference, subjectivity and decision theory====

Many informal Bayesian inferences are based on &quot;intuitively reasonable&quot; summaries of the posterior. For example, the posterior mean, median and mode, highest posterior density intervals, and Bayes Factors can all be motivated in this way. While a user&#x27;s utility function need not be stated for this sort of inference, these summaries do all depend (to some extent) on stated prior beliefs, and are generally viewed as subjective conclusions. (Methods of prior construction which do not require external input have been proposed but not yet fully developed.)

Formally, Bayesian inference is calibrated with reference to an explicitly stated utility, or loss function; the &#x27;Bayes rule&#x27; is the one which maximizes expected utility, averaged over the posterior uncertainty. Formal Bayesian inference therefore automatically provides optimal decisions in a decision theoretic sense. Given assumptions, data and utility, Bayesian inference can be made for essentially any problem, although not every statistical inference need have a Bayesian interpretation. Analyses which are not formally Bayesian can be (logically) incoherent; a feature of Bayesian procedures which use proper priors (i.e. those integrable to one) is that they are guaranteed to be coherent. Some advocates of Bayesian inference assert that inference &quot;must&quot; take place in this decision-theoretic framework, and that Bayesian inference should not conclude with the evaluation and summarization of posterior beliefs.

===Likelihood-based inference===
Likelihood-based inference is a paradigm used to estimate the parameters of a statistical model based on observed data. Likelihoodism approaches statistics by using the likelihood function, denoted as formula_10, quantifies the probability of observing the given data formula_11, assuming a specific set of parameter values formula_12. In likelihood-based inference, the goal is to find the set of parameter values that maximizes the likelihood function, or equivalently, maximizes the probability of observing the given data.

The process of likelihood-based inference usually involves the following steps:

# Formulating the statistical model: A statistical model is defined based on the problem at hand, specifying the distributional assumptions and the relationship between the observed data and the unknown parameters. The model can be simple, such as a normal distribution with known variance, or complex, such as a hierarchical model with multiple levels of random effects.
# Constructing the likelihood function: Given the statistical model, the likelihood function is constructed by evaluating the joint probability density or mass function of the observed data as a function of the unknown parameters. This function represents the probability of observing the data for different values of the parameters.
# Maximizing the likelihood function: The next step is to find the set of parameter values that maximizes the likelihood function. This can be achieved using optimization techniques such as numerical optimization algorithms. The estimated parameter values, often denoted as formula_13, are the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs).
# Assessing uncertainty: Once the MLEs are obtained, it is crucial to quantify the uncertainty associated with the parameter estimates. This can be done by calculating standard errors, confidence intervals, or conducting hypothesis tests based on asymptotic theory or simulation techniques such as bootstrapping.
# Model checking: After obtaining the parameter estimates and assessing their uncertainty, it is important to assess the adequacy of the statistical model. This involves checking the assumptions made in the model and evaluating the fit of the model to the data using goodness-of-fit tests, residual analysis, or graphical diagnostics.
# Inference and interpretation: Finally, based on the estimated parameters and model assessment, statistical inference can be performed. This involves drawing conclusions about the population parameters, making predictions, or testing hypotheses based on the estimated model.

===AIC-based inference===
The &quot;Akaike information criterion&quot; (AIC) is an estimator of the relative quality of statistical models for a given set of data. Given a collection of models for the data, AIC estimates the quality of each model, relative to each of the other models. Thus, AIC provides a means for model selection.

AIC is founded on information theory: it offers an estimate of the relative information lost when a given model is used to represent the process that generated the data. (In doing so, it deals with the trade-off between the goodness of fit of the model and the simplicity of the model.)

===Other paradigms for inference===

====Minimum description length====
The minimum description length (MDL) principle has been developed from ideas in information theory and the theory of Kolmogorov complexity. The (MDL) principle selects statistical models that maximally compress the data; inference proceeds without assuming counterfactual or non-falsifiable &quot;data-generating mechanisms&quot; or probability models for the data, as might be done in frequentist or Bayesian approaches.

However, if a &quot;data generating mechanism&quot; does exist in reality, then according to Shannon&#x27;s source coding theorem it provides the MDL description of the data, on average and asymptotically. In minimizing description length (or descriptive complexity), MDL estimation is similar to maximum likelihood estimation and maximum a posteriori estimation (using maximum-entropy Bayesian priors). However, MDL avoids assuming that the underlying probability model is known; the MDL principle can also be applied without assumptions that e.g. the data arose from independent sampling.

The MDL principle has been applied in communication-coding theory in information theory, in linear regression, and in data mining.

The evaluation of MDL-based inferential procedures often uses techniques or criteria from computational complexity theory.

====Fiducial inference====

Fiducial inference was an approach to statistical inference based on fiducial probability, also known as a &quot;fiducial distribution&quot;. In subsequent work, this approach has been called ill-defined, extremely limited in applicability, and even fallacious. However this argument is the same as that which shows that a so-called confidence distribution is not a valid probability distribution and, since this has not invalidated the application of confidence intervals, it does not necessarily invalidate conclusions drawn from fiducial arguments. An attempt was made to reinterpret the early work of Fisher&#x27;s fiducial argument as a special case of an inference theory using upper and lower probabilities.

====Structural inference====

Developing ideas of Fisher and of Pitman from 1938 to 1939, George A. Barnard developed &quot;structural inference&quot; or &quot;pivotal inference&quot;, an approach using invariant probabilities on group families. Barnard reformulated the arguments behind fiducial inference on a restricted class of models on which &quot;fiducial&quot; procedures would be well-defined and useful. Donald A. S. Fraser developed a general theory for structural inference based on group theory and applied this to linear models. The theory formulated by Fraser has close links to decision theory and Bayesian statistics and can provide optimal frequentist decision rules if they exist.

== Predictive inference ==
Predictive inference is an approach to statistical inference that emphasizes the prediction of future observations based on past observations.

Initially, predictive inference was based on &quot;observable&quot; parameters and it was the main purpose of studying probability, but it fell out of favor in the 20th century due to a new parametric approach pioneered by Bruno de Finetti. The approach modeled phenomena as a physical system observed with error (e.g., celestial mechanics). De Finetti&#x27;s idea of exchangeability—that future observations should behave like past observations—came to the attention of the English-speaking world with the 1974 translation from French of his 1937 paper, and has since been propounded by such statisticians as Seymour Geisser.

<text>In statistics, survey sampling describes the process of selecting a sample of elements from a target population to conduct a survey. 
The term &quot;survey&quot; may refer to many different types or techniques of observation. In survey sampling it most often involves a questionnaire used to measure the characteristics and/or attitudes of people. Different ways of contacting members of a sample once they have been selected is the subject of survey data collection. The purpose of sampling is to reduce the cost and/or the amount of work that it would take to survey the entire target population. A survey that measures the entire target population is called a census. A sample refers to a group or section of a population from which information is to be obtained.

Survey samples can be broadly divided into two types: probability samples and super samples. Probability-based samples implement a sampling plan with specified probabilities (perhaps adapted probabilities specified by an adaptive procedure). Probability-based sampling allows design-based inference about the target population. The inferences are based on a known objective probability distribution that was specified in the study protocol. Inferences from probability-based surveys may still suffer from many types of bias.

Surveys that are not based on probability sampling have greater difficulty measuring their bias or sampling error. Surveys based on non-probability samples often fail to represent the people in the target population.

In academic and government survey research, probability sampling is a standard procedure. In the United States, the Office of Management and Budget&#x27;s &quot;List of Standards for Statistical Surveys&quot; states that federally funded surveys must be performed:

selecting samples using generally accepted statistical methods (e.g., probabilistic methods that can provide estimates of sampling error). Any use of nonprobability sampling methods (e.g., cut-off or model-based samples) must be justified statistically and be able to measure estimation error.

Random sampling and design-based inference are supplemented by other statistical methods, such as model-assisted sampling and model-based sampling.

For example, many surveys have substantial amounts of nonresponse. Even though the units are initially chosen with known probabilities, the nonresponse mechanisms are unknown. For surveys with substantial nonresponse, statisticians have proposed statistical models with which the data sets are analyzed.

Issues related to survey sampling are discussed in several sources, including Salant and Dillman (1994).

==Probability sampling==
In a probability sample (also called &quot;scientific&quot; or &quot;random&quot; sample) each member of the target population has a known and non-zero probability of inclusion in the sample. A survey based on a probability sample can in theory produce statistical measurements of the target population that are unbiased, because the expected value of the sample mean is equal to the population mean, E(ȳ)=μ, or have a measurable sampling error, which can be expressed as a confidence interval or margin of error. 

A probability-based survey sample is created by constructing a list of the target population, called the sampling frame, a randomized process for selecting units from the sample frame, called a selection procedure, and a method of contacting selected units to enable them to complete the survey, called a data collection method or mode. For some target populations this process may be easy; for example, sampling the employees of a company by using payroll lists. However, in large, disorganized populations simply constructing a suitable sample frame is often a complex and expensive task.

Common methods of conducting a probability sample of the household population in the United States are Area Probability Sampling, Random Digit Dial telephone sampling, and more recently, Address-Based Sampling.

Within probability sampling, there are specialized techniques such as stratified sampling and cluster sampling that improve the precision or efficiency of the sampling process without altering the fundamental principles of probability sampling.

Stratification is the process of dividing members of the population into homogeneous subgroups before sampling, based on auxiliary information about each sample unit. The strata should be mutually exclusive: every element in the population must be assigned to only one stratum. The strata should also be collectively exhaustive: no population element can be excluded. Then methods such as simple random sampling or systematic sampling can be applied within each stratum. Stratification often improves the representativeness of the sample by reducing sampling error.

==Bias in probability sampling==

Bias in surveys is undesirable, but often unavoidable. The major types of bias that may occur in the sampling process are:
* Non-response bias: When individuals or households selected in the survey sample cannot or will not complete the survey there is the potential for bias to result from this non-response. Nonresponse bias occurs when the observed value deviates from the population parameter due to differences between respondents and nonrespondents.
* Response bias: This is not the opposite of non-response bias, but instead relates to a possible tendency of respondents to give inaccurate or untruthful answers for various reasons.
* Selection Bias: Selection bias occurs when some units have a differing probability of selection that is unaccounted for by the researcher. For example, some households have multiple phone numbers making them more likely to be selected in a telephone survey than households with only one phone number. This selection bias would be corrected by applying a survey weight equal to [1/(# of phone numbers)] to each household.
* Self-selection bias: A type of bias in which individuals voluntarily select themselves into a group, thereby potentially biasing the response of that group.
* Participation bias: Bias that arises due to the characteristics of those who choose to participate in a survey or poll.
* Coverage bias: Coverage bias can occur when population members do not appear in the sample frame (undercoverage). Coverage bias occurs when the observed value deviates from the population parameter due to differences between covered and non-covered units. Telephone surveys suffer from a well known source of coverage bias because they cannot include households without telephones.

==Non-probability sampling==

Many surveys are not based on probability samples, but rather on finding a suitable collection of respondents to complete the survey. Some common examples of non-probability sampling are:
* Judgement Samples: A researcher decides which population members to include in the sample based on his or her judgement. The researcher may provide some alternative justification for the representativeness of the sample. The underlying assumption is that the investigator will select units that are characteristic of the population. This method can be subjected to researcher&#x27;s biases and perception.
* Snowball Samples: Often used when a target population is rare. Members of the target population recruit other members of the population for the survey.
* Quota Samples: The sample is designed to include a designated number of people with certain specified characteristics. For example, 100 coffee drinkers. This type of sampling is common in non-probability market research surveys.
* Convenience Samples: The sample is composed of whatever persons can be most easily accessed to fill out the survey.

In non-probability samples the relationship between the target population and the survey sample is immeasurable and potential bias is unknowable. Sophisticated users of non-probability survey samples tend to view the survey as an experimental condition, rather than a tool for population measurement, and examine the results for internally consistent relationships.

<text>The theory of statistics provides a basis for the whole range of techniques, in both study design and data analysis, that are used within applications of statistics. The theory covers approaches to statistical-decision problems and to statistical inference, and the actions and deductions that satisfy the basic principles stated for these different approaches. Within a given approach, statistical theory gives ways of comparing statistical procedures; it can find the best possible procedure within a given context for given statistical problems, or can provide guidance on the choice between alternative procedures.

Apart from philosophical considerations about how to make statistical inferences and decisions, much of statistical theory consists of mathematical statistics, and is closely linked to probability theory, to utility theory, and to optimization.

==Scope==

Statistical theory provides an underlying rationale and provides a consistent basis for the choice of methodology used in applied statistics.

===Modelling===

Statistical models describe the sources of data and can have different types of formulation corresponding to these sources and to the problem being studied. Such problems can be of various kinds:
*Sampling from a finite population
*Measuring observational error and refining procedures
*Studying statistical relations
Statistical models, once specified, can be tested to see whether they provide useful inferences for new data sets. 

=== Data collection ===
Statistical theory provides a guide to comparing methods of data collection, where the problem is to generate informative data using optimization and randomization while measuring and controlling for observational error. Optimization of data collection reduces the cost of data while satisfying statistical goals, while randomization allows reliable inferences. Statistical theory provides a basis for good data collection and the structuring of investigations in the topics of:
*Design of experiments to estimate treatment effects, to test hypotheses, and to optimize responses.
*Survey sampling to describe populations

===Summarising data===
The task of summarising statistical data in conventional forms (also known as descriptive statistics) is considered in theoretical statistics as a problem of defining what aspects of statistical samples need to be described and how well they can be described from a typically limited sample of data. Thus the problems theoretical statistics considers include:
*Choosing summary statistics to describe a sample
*Summarising probability distributions of sample data while making limited assumptions about the form of distribution that may be met
*Summarising the relationships between different quantities measured on the same items with a sample

===Interpreting data===
Besides the philosophy underlying statistical inference, statistical theory has the task of considering the types of questions that data analysts might want to ask about the problems they are studying and of providing data analytic techniques for answering them. Some of these tasks are:
*Summarising populations in the form of a fitted distribution or probability density function
*Summarising the relationship between variables using some type of regression analysis
*Providing ways of predicting the outcome of a random quantity given other related variables
*Examining the possibility of reducing the number of variables being considered within a problem (the task of Dimension reduction)
When a statistical procedure has been specified in the study protocol, then statistical theory provides well-defined probability statements for the method when applied to all populations that could have arisen from the randomization used to generate the data. This provides an objective way of estimating parameters, estimating confidence intervals, testing hypotheses, and selecting the best. Even for observational data, statistical theory provides a way of calculating a value that can be used to interpret a sample of data from a population, it can provide a means of indicating how well that value is determined by the sample, and thus a means of saying corresponding values derived for different populations are as different as they might seem; however, the reliability of inferences from post-hoc observational data is often worse than for planned randomized generation of data.

===Applied statistical inference===
Statistical theory provides the basis for a number of data-analytic approaches that are common across scientific and social research. Interpreting data is done with one of the following approaches:
*Estimating parameters
*Providing a range of values instead of a point estimate
*Testing statistical hypotheses

Many of the standard methods for those approaches rely on certain statistical assumptions (made in the derivation of the methodology) actually holding in practice. Statistical theory studies the consequences of departures from these assumptions. In addition it provides a range of robust statistical techniques that are less dependent on assumptions, and it provides methods checking whether particular assumptions are reasonable for a given data set.

<text>In statistics, a unit is one member of a set of entities being studied. It is the main source for the mathematical abstraction of a &quot;random variable&quot;. Common examples of a unit would be a single person, animal, plant, manufactured item, or country that belongs to a larger collection of such entities being studied.

==Experimental and sampling units==
Units are often referred to as being either experimental units or sampling units:

* An &quot;experimental unit&quot; is typically thought of as one member of a set of objects that are initially equal, with each object then subjected to one of several experimental treatments. Put simply, it is the smallest entity to which a treatment is applied.
* A &quot;sampling unit&quot; (or unit of observation) is typically thought of as an object that has been sampled from a statistical population. This term is commonly used in opinion polling and survey sampling.

For example, in an experiment on educational methods, methods may be applied to classrooms of students. This would make the classroom as the experimental unit. Measurements of progress may be obtained from individual students, as observational units. But the treatment (teaching method) being applied to the class would not be applied independently to the individual students. Hence, the student could not be regarded as the experimental unit. The class, or the teacher (who applies the method, if he/she has multiple classes), would be the appropriate experimental unit.

==Implementation==
In most statistical studies, the goal is to generalize from the observed units to a larger set consisting of all comparable units that exist but are not directly observed. For example, if we randomly sample 100 people and ask them which candidate they intend to vote for in an election, our main interest is in the voting behavior of all eligible voters, not exclusively on the 100 observed units.

In some cases, the observed units may not form a sample from any meaningful population, but rather constitute a convenience sample, or may represent the entire population of interest. In this situation, we may study the units descriptively, or we may study their dynamics over time. But it typically does not make sense to talk about generalizing to a larger population of such units. Studies involving countries or business firms are often of this type. Clinical trials also typically use convenience samples, however the aim is often to make inferences about the effectiveness of treatments in other patients, and given the inclusion and exclusion criteria for some clinical trials, the sample may not be representative of the majority of patients with the condition or disease.

In simple data sets, the units are in one-to-one correspondence with the data values. In more complex data sets, multiple measurements are made for each unit. For example, if blood pressure measurements are made daily for a week on each subject in a study, there would be seven data values for each statistical unit. Multiple measurements taken on an individual are not independent (they will be more alike compared to measurements taken on different individuals). Ignoring these dependencies, the analysis can lead to an inflated sample size or pseudoreplication.

While a &quot;unit&quot; is often the lowest level at which observations are made, in some cases, a &quot;unit&quot; can be further decomposed as a statistical assembly.

Many statistical analyses use quantitative data that have units of measurement. This is a distinct and non-overlapping use of the term &quot;unit.&quot;

==Units of collection and analysis==
Statistical units are divided into two types. They are:

* Unit of collection: units in which figures relating to a particular problem are either enumerated or estimated. The units of collection may be simple or composite. 
**A simple unit is one which represents a single condition without any qualification. 
**A composite unit is one which is formed by adding a qualification word or phrase to a simple unit. For example, labour-hours and passenger-kilometer.

* Unit of analysis and interpretation: units in terms of which statistical data are analyzed and interpreted. For example, ratios, percentage, and coefficient, etc.

<text>In statistics, for example in statistical quality control, a statistical assembly is a collection of parts or components which makes up a statistical unit. Thus a statistical unit, which would be the prime item of concern, is made of discrete components like organs or machine parts. The reliability of the statistical unit is, in part, determined by the reliability of the components in the statistical assembly, and by their interactions.

Much of the observation of a statistical assembly requires special preparation of the unit, which demands that the intervention must not prejudice the observations. A simple version of this kind of research uses the stimulus-response model.

In other contexts, statistical assembly refers to the process of constructing a manufactured item which must be carefully specified to contain given amounts of nonuniformity within it.

<text>The stimulus–response model is a conceptual framework in psychology that describes how individuals react to external stimuli. According to this model, an external stimulus triggers a reaction in an organism, often without the need for conscious thought. This model emphasizes the mechanistic aspects of behavior, suggesting that behavior can often be predicted and controlled by understanding and manipulating the stimuli that trigger responses.

==Fields of application==

Stimulus–response models are applied in international relations, 
psychology, 
risk assessment, 
neuroscience,
neurally-inspired system design,
and many other fields.

Pharmacological dose response relationships are an application of stimulus-response models.

Another field this model can be applied to is psychological problems/disorders such as Tourette syndrome. Research shows Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) can be characterized by enhanced cognitive functions related to creating, modifying and maintaining connections between stimuli and responses (S‐R links). Specifically, two areas, procedural sequence learning and, as a novel finding, also event file binding, show converging evidence of hyperfunctioning in GTS.

Previous research on E-learning has proven that studying online can be even more daunting for lecturers and students who suddenly change their learning patterns from the classrooms to the virtual ones. This is mainly because the suddenness of this change makes it difficult for lecturers to fully prepare to lecture in the virtual learning environment. In light of the above-mentioned facts, this research proposes a novel model and integrates flow theory into the theory of technology acceptance model (TAM), based on stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) theory, the SOR model has been widely used in previous studies of online customer behavior, and the model theory includes three components: stimulus, organism, and response. Assuming that stimuli contained in the external environment cause people to change, which affects their behavior.

==Mathematical formulation==

The object of a stimulus–response model is to establish a mathematical function that describes the relation &quot;f&quot; between the stimulus &quot;x&quot; and the expected value (or other measure of location) of the response &quot;Y&quot;:

: formula_1

A common simplification assumed for such functions is linear, thus we expect to see a relationship like

: formula_2

Statistical theory for linear models has been well developed for more than fifty years, and a standard form of analysis called linear regression has been developed.

== Bounded response functions ==

Since many types of response have inherent physical limitations (e.g. minimal maximal muscle contraction), it is often applicable to use a bounded function (such as the logistic function) to model the response. Similarly, a linear response function may be unrealistic as it would imply arbitrarily large responses. For binary dependent variables, statistical analysis with regression methods such as the probit model or logit model, or other methods such as the Spearman–Kärber method. Empirical models based on nonlinear regression are usually preferred over the use of some transformation of the data that linearizes the stimulus-response relationship.

One example of a logit model for the probability of a response to the real input (stimulus) formula_3, (formula_4) is

:formula_5

where formula_6 are the parameters of the function.

Conversely, a Probit model would be of the form

:formula_7

where formula_8 is the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution.

=== Hill equation ===

In biochemistry and pharmacology, the Hill equation refers to two closely related equations, one of which describes the response (the physiological output of the system, such as muscle contraction) to Drug or Toxin, as a function of the drug&#x27;s concentration. The Hill equation is important in the construction of dose-response curves. The Hill equation is the following formula, where formula_9 is the magnitude of the response, &lt;chem&gt;[A]&lt;/chem&gt; is the drug concentration (or equivalently, stimulus intensity), formula_10 is the drug concentration that produces a half-maximal response and formula_11 is the Hill coefficient.

:formula_12

The Hill equation rearranges to a logistic function with respect to the logarithm of the dose (similar to a logit model).

== Founder of the Model ==

=== Ivan Pavlov ===
Pavlov started studying the digestive system in dogs by performing chronic implants of fistulas in the stomach, by which he was able to show with extreme clarity that the nervous system plays a dominant role in the regulation of the digestive process. Experiments on digestion led to the development of the first experimental model of learning, in which a neutral stimulus acquires the capacity to evoke a specific response further to repeated pairing with another stimulus that evokes the response. 

==== Edward Thorndike ====

Thorndike, who proposed the model, believed that learning stemmed from stimulus and response. Pavlov popularized and revolutionized the theory though by experimenting on the dogs.

<doc id="27585" wikidata="Q49918" url="?curid=27585" title="Statistical population">
<text>In statistics, a population is a set of similar items or events which is of interest for some question or experiment. A statistical population can be a group of existing objects (e.g. the set of all stars within the Milky Way galaxy) or a hypothetical and potentially infinite group of objects conceived as a generalization from experience (e.g. the set of all possible hands in a game of poker). A common aim of statistical analysis is to produce information about some chosen population.

In statistical inference, a subset of the population (a statistical &quot;sample&quot;) is chosen to represent the population in a statistical analysis. Moreover, the statistical sample must be unbiased and accurately model the population. The ratio of the size of this statistical sample to the size of the population is called a &quot;sampling fraction&quot;. It is then possible to estimate the &quot;population parameters&quot; using the appropriate sample statistics.

==Mean==
The population mean, or population expected value, is a measure of the central tendency either of a probability distribution or of a random variable characterized by that distribution. In a discrete probability distribution of a random variable formula_1, the mean is equal to the sum over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value; that is, it is computed by taking the product of each possible value formula_2 of formula_1 and its probability formula_4, and then adding all these products together, giving formula_5. An analogous formula applies to the case of a continuous probability distribution. Not every probability distribution has a defined mean (see the Cauchy distribution for an example). Moreover, the mean can be infinite for some distributions.

For a finite population, the population mean of a property is equal to the arithmetic mean of the given property, while considering every member of the population. For example, the population mean height is equal to the sum of the heights of every individual—divided by the total number of individuals. The &quot;sample mean&quot; may differ from the population mean, especially for small samples. The law of large numbers states that the larger the size of the sample, the more likely it is that the sample mean will be close to the population mean.

<text>In descriptive statistics, summary statistics are used to summarize a set of observations, in order to communicate the largest amount of information as simply as possible. Statisticians commonly try to describe the observations in
* a measure of location, or central tendency, such as the arithmetic mean
* a measure of statistical dispersion like the standard mean absolute deviation
* a measure of the shape of the distribution like skewness or kurtosis
* if more than one variable is measured, a measure of statistical dependence such as a correlation coefficient

A common collection of order statistics used as summary statistics are the five-number summary, sometimes extended to a seven-number summary, and the associated box plot.

Entries in an analysis of variance table can also be regarded as summary statistics.

==Examples==

===Location===

Common measures of location, or central tendency, are the arithmetic mean, median, mode, and interquartile mean.

===Spread===
Common measures of statistical dispersion are the standard deviation, variance, range, interquartile range, absolute deviation, mean absolute difference and the distance standard deviation. Measures that assess spread in comparison to the typical size of data values include the coefficient of variation.

The Gini coefficient was originally developed to measure income inequality and is equivalent to one of the L-moments.

A simple summary of a dataset is sometimes given by quoting particular order statistics as approximations to selected percentiles of a distribution.

===Shape===

Common measures of the shape of a distribution are skewness or kurtosis, while alternatives can be based on L-moments. A different measure is the distance skewness, for which a value of zero implies central symmetry.

===Dependence===

The common measure of dependence between paired random variables is the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, while a common alternative summary statistic is Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient. A value of zero for the distance correlation implies independence.

==Human perception of summary statistics==

Humans efficiently use summary statistics to quickly perceive the gist of auditory and visual information.

<text>In descriptive statistics, the range of a set of data is size of the narrowest interval which contains all the data.
It is calculated as the difference between the largest and smallest values (also known as the sample maximum and minimum). 
It is expressed in the same units as the data. 
The range provides an indication of statistical dispersion. Since it only depends on two of the observations, it is most useful in representing the dispersion of small data sets.

==For continuous IID random variables==
For &quot;n&quot; independent and identically distributed continuous random variables &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; with the cumulative distribution function G(&quot;x&quot;) and a probability density function g(&quot;x&quot;), let T denote the range of them, that is, T= max(&quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;)-
min(&quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;).

===Distribution===
The range, T, has the cumulative distribution function
::formula_1
Gumbel notes that the &quot;beauty of this formula is completely marred by the facts that, in general, we cannot express &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot; + &quot;t&quot;) by &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), and that the numerical integration is lengthy and tiresome.&quot;

If the distribution of each &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; is limited to the right (or left) then the asymptotic distribution of the range is equal to the asymptotic distribution of the largest (smallest) value. For more general distributions the asymptotic distribution can be expressed as a Bessel function.

===Moments===
The mean range is given by
::formula_2
where &quot;x&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is the inverse function. In the case where each of the &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; has a standard normal distribution, the mean range is given by
::formula_3

==For continuous non-IID random variables==
For &quot;n&quot; nonidentically distributed independent continuous random variables &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; with cumulative distribution functions &quot;G&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;G&quot;2(&quot;x&quot;), ..., &quot;G&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and probability density functions &quot;g&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;g&quot;2(&quot;x&quot;), ..., &quot;g&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), the range has cumulative distribution function 
::formula_4

==For discrete IID random variables==
For &quot;n&quot; independent and identically distributed discrete random variables &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; with cumulative distribution function &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) and probability mass function &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) the range of the &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the range of a sample of size &quot;n&quot; from a population with distribution function &quot;G&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). We can assume without loss of generality that the support of each &quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot; is {1,2,3...,&quot;N&quot;} where &quot;N&quot; is a positive integer or infinity.

===Distribution===
The range has probability mass function
::formula_5 

====Example====
If we suppose that &quot;g&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 1/&quot;N&quot;, the discrete uniform distribution for all &quot;x&quot;, then we find
::formula_6

==Derivation==
The probability of having a specific range value, &quot;t&quot;, can be determined by adding the probabilities of having two samples differing by &quot;t&quot;, and every other sample having a value between the two extremes.
The probability of one sample having a value of &quot;x&quot; is formula_7. The probability of another having a value &quot;t&quot; greater than &quot;x&quot; is:
:formula_8
The probability of all other values lying between these two extremes is:
:formula_9
Combining the three together yields:
:formula_10

==Related quantities==
The range is a specific example of order statistics. In particular, the range is a linear function of order statistics, which brings it into the scope of L-estimation.

<text>In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation of the values of a variable about its mean. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. The standard deviation is commonly used in the determination of what constitutes an outlier and what does not. Standard deviation may be abbreviated SD or std dev, and is most commonly represented in mathematical texts and equations by the lowercase Greek letter [[Sigma|σ]] (sigma), for the population standard deviation, or the Latin letter s, for the sample standard deviation.

The standard deviation of a random variable, sample, statistical population, data set, or probability distribution is the square root of its variance. (For a finite population, variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean.) A useful property of the standard deviation is that, unlike the variance, it is expressed in the same unit as the data. Standard deviation can also be used to calculate standard error for a finite sample, and to determine statistical significance.

When only a sample of data from a population is available, the term &quot;standard deviation of the sample&quot; or &quot;sample standard deviation&quot; can refer to either the above-mentioned quantity as applied to those data, or to a modified quantity that is an unbiased estimate of the &quot;population standard deviation&quot; (the standard deviation of the entire population).

==Relationship with standard error and statistical significance==

The standard deviation of a population or sample and the standard error of a statistic (e.g., of the sample mean) are quite different, but related. The sample mean&#x27;s standard error is the standard deviation of the set of means that would be found by drawing an infinite number of repeated samples from the population and computing a mean for each sample. The mean&#x27;s standard error turns out to equal the population standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size, and is estimated by using the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. For example, a poll&#x27;s standard error (what is reported as the margin of error of the poll), is the expected standard deviation of the estimated mean if the same poll were to be conducted multiple times. Thus, the standard error estimates the standard deviation of an estimate, which itself measures how much the estimate depends on the particular sample that was taken from the population. 

In science, it is common to report both the standard deviation of the data (as a summary statistic) and the standard error of the estimate (as a measure of potential error in the findings). By convention, only effects more than two standard errors away from a null expectation are considered &quot;statistically significant&quot;, a safeguard against spurious conclusion that is really due to random sampling error. 

==Basic examples==

===Population standard deviation of grades of eight students===
Suppose that the entire population of interest is eight students in a particular class. For a finite set of numbers, the population standard deviation is found by taking the square root of the average of the squared deviations of the values subtracted from their average value. The marks of a class of eight students (that is, a statistical population) are the following eight values:
formula_1

These eight data points have the mean (average) of 5:
formula_2

First, calculate the deviations of each data point from the mean, and square the result of each:
formula_3

The variance is the mean of these values:
formula_4

and the &quot;population&quot; standard deviation is equal to the square root of the variance:
formula_5

This formula is valid only if the eight values with which we began form the complete population. If the values instead were a random sample drawn from some large parent population (for example, there were 8 students randomly and independently chosen from a class of 2 million), then one divides by instead of in the denominator of the last formula, and the result is formula_6 In that case, the result of the original formula would be called the &quot;sample&quot; standard deviation and denoted by formula_7 instead of formula_8 Dividing by formula_9 rather than by formula_10 gives an unbiased estimate of the variance of the larger parent population. This is known as &quot;Bessel&#x27;s correction&quot;. Roughly, the reason for it is that the formula for the sample variance relies on computing differences of observations from the sample mean, and the sample mean itself was constructed to be as close as possible to the observations, so just dividing by &quot;n&quot; would underestimate the variability.

===Standard deviation of average height for adult men===
If the population of interest is approximately normally distributed, the standard deviation provides information on the proportion of observations above or below certain values. For example, the average height for adult men in the United States is about , with a standard deviation of around . This means that most men (about 68%, assuming a normal distribution) have a height within 3 inches of the mean ()one standard deviationand almost all men (about 95%) have a height within of the mean ()two standard deviations. If the standard deviation were zero, then all men would share an identical height of 69 inches. Three standard deviations account for 99.73% of the sample population being studied, assuming the distribution is normal or bell-shaped (see the 68–95–99.7 rule, or the &quot;empirical rule,&quot; for more information).

==Definition of population values==
Let &quot;μ&quot; be the expected value (the average) of random variable with density :
formula_11
The standard deviation of is defined as 
formula_12
which can be shown to equal formula_13
Using words, the standard deviation is the square root of the variance of .

The standard deviation of a probability distribution is the same as that of a random variable having that distribution. 

Not all random variables have a standard deviation. If the distribution has fat tails going out to infinity, the standard deviation might not exist, because the integral might not converge. The normal distribution has tails going out to infinity, but its mean and standard deviation do exist, because the tails diminish quickly enough. The Pareto distribution with parameter formula_14 has a mean, but not a standard deviation (loosely speaking, the standard deviation is infinite). The Cauchy distribution has neither a mean nor a standard deviation.

===Discrete random variable===
In the case where takes random values from a finite data set , with each value having the same probability, the standard deviation is

formula_15
Note: The above expression has a built-in bias. See the discussion on Bessel&#x27;s correction further down below.
or, by using summation notation,

formula_16

If, instead of having equal probabilities, the values have different probabilities, let have probability , have probability have probability . In this case, the standard deviation will be
formula_17

===Continuous random variable===
The standard deviation of a continuous real-valued random variable with probability density function is
formula_18

and where the integrals are definite integrals taken for ranging over the set of possible values of the random variable .

In the case of a parametric family of distributions, the standard deviation can be expressed in terms of the parameters. For example, in the case of the log-normal distribution with parameters and , the standard deviation is
formula_19

==Estimation==


One can find the standard deviation of an entire population in cases (such as standardized testing) where every member of a population is sampled. In cases where that cannot be done, the standard deviation &quot;σ&quot; is estimated by examining a random sample taken from the population and computing a statistic of the sample, which is used as an estimate of the population standard deviation. Such a statistic is called an estimator, and the estimator (or the value of the estimator, namely the estimate) is called a sample standard deviation, and is denoted by &quot;s&quot; (possibly with modifiers).

Unlike in the case of estimating the population mean of a normal distribution, for which the sample mean is a simple estimator with many desirable properties (unbiased, efficient, maximum likelihood), there is no single estimator for the standard deviation with all these properties, and unbiased estimation of standard deviation is a very technically involved problem. Most often, the standard deviation is estimated using the &quot;corrected sample standard deviation&quot; (using &quot;N&quot; − 1), defined below, and this is often referred to as the &quot;sample standard deviation&quot;, without qualifiers. However, other estimators are better in other respects: the uncorrected estimator (using &quot;N&quot;) yields lower mean squared error, while using &quot;N&quot; − 1.5 (for the normal distribution) almost completely eliminates bias.

===Uncorrected sample standard deviation===
The formula for the &quot;population&quot; standard deviation (of a finite population) can be applied to the sample, using the size of the sample as the size of the population (though the actual population size from which the sample is drawn may be much larger). This estimator, denoted by &quot;s&quot;&quot;N&quot;, is known as the &quot;uncorrected sample standard deviation&quot;, or sometimes the &quot;standard deviation of the sample&quot; (considered as the entire population), and is defined as follows:
formula_20

where formula_21 are the observed values of the sample items, and formula_22 is the mean value of these observations, while the denominator &quot;N&quot; stands for the size of the sample: this is the square root of the sample variance, which is the average of the squared deviations about the sample mean.

This is a consistent estimator (it converges in probability to the population value as the number of samples goes to infinity), and is the maximum-likelihood estimate when the population is normally distributed. However, this is a biased estimator, as the estimates are generally too low. The bias decreases as sample size grows, dropping off as 1/&quot;N&quot;, and thus is most significant for small or moderate sample sizes; for formula_23 the bias is below 1%. Thus for very large sample sizes, the uncorrected sample standard deviation is generally acceptable. This estimator also has a uniformly smaller mean squared error than the corrected sample standard deviation.

===Corrected sample standard deviation===

If the &quot;biased sample variance&quot; (the second central moment of the sample, which is a downward-biased estimate of the population variance) is used to compute an estimate of the population&#x27;s standard deviation, the result is
formula_24

Here taking the square root introduces further downward bias, by Jensen&#x27;s inequality, due to the square root&#x27;s being a concave function. The bias in the variance is easily corrected, but the bias from the square root is more difficult to correct, and depends on the distribution in question.

An unbiased estimator for the &quot;variance&quot; is given by applying Bessel&#x27;s correction, using &quot;N&quot; − 1 instead of &quot;N&quot; to yield the &quot;unbiased sample variance,&quot; denoted &quot;s&quot;2:
formula_25

This estimator is unbiased if the variance exists and the sample values are drawn independently with replacement. &quot;N&quot; − 1 corresponds to the number of degrees of freedom in the vector of deviations from the mean, formula_26

Taking square roots reintroduces bias (because the square root is a nonlinear function which does not commute with the expectation, i.e. often formula_27), yielding the &quot;corrected sample standard deviation,&quot; denoted by &quot;s:&quot;
formula_28

As explained above, while &quot;s&quot;2 is an unbiased estimator for the population variance, &quot;s&quot; is still a biased estimator for the population standard deviation, though markedly less biased than the uncorrected sample standard deviation. This estimator is commonly used and generally known simply as the &quot;sample standard deviation&quot;. The bias may still be large for small samples (&quot;N&quot; less than 10). As sample size increases, the amount of bias decreases. We obtain more information and the difference between formula_29 and formula_30 becomes smaller.

===Unbiased sample standard deviation===
For unbiased estimation of standard deviation, there is no formula that works across all distributions, unlike for mean and variance. Instead, is used as a basis, and is scaled by a correction factor to produce an unbiased estimate. For the normal distribution, an unbiased estimator is given by , where the correction factor (which depends on ) is given in terms of the Gamma function, and equals:
formula_31

This arises because the sampling distribution of the sample standard deviation follows a (scaled) chi distribution, and the correction factor is the mean of the chi distribution.

An approximation can be given by replacing with , yielding:
formula_32

The error in this approximation decays quadratically (as ), and it is suited for all but the smallest samples or highest precision: for the bias is equal to 1.3%, and for the bias is already less than 0.1%.

A more accurate approximation is to replace above with .

For other distributions, the correct formula depends on the distribution, but a rule of thumb is to use the further refinement of the approximation:
formula_33

where denotes the population excess kurtosis. The excess kurtosis may be either known beforehand for certain distributions, or estimated from the data.

===Confidence interval of a sampled standard deviation===

The standard deviation we obtain by sampling a distribution is itself not absolutely accurate, both for mathematical reasons (explained here by the confidence interval) and for practical reasons of measurement (measurement error). The mathematical effect can be described by the confidence interval or CI. 

To show how a larger sample will make the confidence interval narrower, consider the following examples: 
A small population of has only one degree of freedom for estimating the standard deviation. The result is that a 95% CI of the SD runs from 0.45 × SD to 31.9 × SD; the factors here are as follows:

formula_34

where formula_35 is the -th quantile of the chi-square distribution with degrees of freedom, and is the confidence level. This is equivalent to the following:

formula_36

With , and . The reciprocals of the square roots of these two numbers give us the factors 0.45 and 31.9 given above.

A larger population of has 9 degrees of freedom for estimating the standard deviation. The same computations as above give us in this case a 95% CI running from 0.69 × SD to 1.83 × SD. So even with a sample population of 10, the actual SD can still be almost a factor 2 higher than the sampled SD. For a sample population , this is down to 0.88 × SD to 1.16 × SD. To be more certain that the sampled SD is close to the actual SD we need to sample a large number of points.

These same formulae can be used to obtain confidence intervals on the variance of residuals from a least squares fit under standard normal theory, where is now the number of degrees of freedom for error.

===Bounds on standard deviation===
For a set of data spanning a range of values , an upper bound on the standard deviation is given by . 
An estimate of the standard deviation for data taken to be approximately normal follows from the heuristic that 95% of the area under the normal curve lies roughly two standard deviations to either side of the mean, so that, with 95% probability the total range of values represents four standard deviations so that . This so-called range rule is useful in sample size estimation, as the range of possible values is easier to estimate than the standard deviation. Other divisors of the range such that are available for other values of and for non-normal distributions.

==Identities and mathematical properties==
The standard deviation is invariant under changes in location, and scales directly with the scale of the random variable. Thus, for a constant and random variables and :
formula_37

The standard deviation of the sum of two random variables can be related to their individual standard deviations and the covariance between them:

formula_38

where formula_39 and formula_40 stand for variance and covariance, respectively.

The calculation of the sum of squared deviations can be related to moments calculated directly from the data. In the following formula, the letter is interpreted to mean expected value, i.e., mean.

formula_41

The sample standard deviation can be computed as:
formula_42

For a finite population with equal probabilities at all points, we have

formula_43

which means that the standard deviation is equal to the square root of the difference between the average of the squares of the values and the square of the average value.

See computational formula for the variance for proof, and for an analogous result for the sample standard deviation.

==Interpretation and application==
A large standard deviation indicates that the data points can spread far from the mean and a small standard deviation indicates that they are clustered closely around the mean.

For example, each of the three populations {0, 0, 14, 14}, {0, 6, 8, 14} and {6, 6, 8, 8} has a mean of 7. Their standard deviations are 7, 5, and 1, respectively. The third population has a much smaller standard deviation than the other two because its values are all close to 7. These standard deviations have the same units as the data points themselves. If, for instance, the data set {0, 6, 8, 14} represents the ages of a population of four siblings in years, the standard deviation is 5 years. As another example, the population {1000, 1006, 1008, 1014} may represent the distances traveled by four athletes, measured in meters. It has a mean of 1007 meters, and a standard deviation of 5 meters.

Standard deviation may serve as a measure of uncertainty. In physical science, for example, the reported standard deviation of a group of repeated measurements gives the precision of those measurements. When deciding whether measurements agree with a theoretical prediction, the standard deviation of those measurements is of crucial importance: if the mean of the measurements is too far away from the prediction (with the distance measured in standard deviations), then the theory being tested probably needs to be revised. This makes sense since they fall outside the range of values that could reasonably be expected to occur if the prediction were correct and the standard deviation appropriately quantified. See prediction interval.

While the standard deviation does measure how far typical values tend to be from the mean, other measures are available. An example is the mean absolute deviation, which might be considered a more direct measure of average distance, compared to the root mean square distance inherent in the standard deviation.

===Application examples===
The practical value of understanding the standard deviation of a set of values is in appreciating how much variation there is from the average (mean).

====Experiment, industrial and hypothesis testing====
Standard deviation is often used to compare real-world data against a model to test the model.
For example, in industrial applications the weight of products coming off a production line may need to comply with a legally required value. By weighing some fraction of the products an average weight can be found, which will always be slightly different from the long-term average. By using standard deviations, a minimum and maximum value can be calculated that the averaged weight will be within some very high percentage of the time (99.9% or more). If it falls outside the range then the production process may need to be corrected. Statistical tests such as these are particularly important when the testing is relatively expensive. For example, if the product needs to be opened and drained and weighed, or if the product was otherwise used up by the test.

In experimental science, a theoretical model of reality is used. Particle physics conventionally uses a standard of &quot;5 sigma&quot; for the declaration of a discovery. A five-sigma level translates to one chance in 3.5 million that a random fluctuation would yield the result. This level of certainty was required in order to assert that a particle consistent with the Higgs boson had been discovered in two independent experiments at CERN, also leading to the declaration of the first observation of gravitational waves.

====Weather====
As a simple example, consider the average daily maximum temperatures for two cities, one inland and one on the coast. It is helpful to understand that the range of daily maximum temperatures for cities near the coast is smaller than for cities inland. Thus, while these two cities may each have the same average maximum temperature, the standard deviation of the daily maximum temperature for the coastal city will be less than that of the inland city as, on any particular day, the actual maximum temperature is more likely to be farther from the average maximum temperature for the inland city than for the coastal one.

====Finance====
In finance, standard deviation is often used as a measure of the risk associated with price-fluctuations of a given asset (stocks, bonds, property, etc.), or the risk of a portfolio of assets (actively managed mutual funds, index mutual funds, or ETFs). Risk is an important factor in determining how to efficiently manage a portfolio of investments because it determines the variation in returns on the asset or portfolio and gives investors a mathematical basis for investment decisions (known as mean-variance optimization). The fundamental concept of risk is that as it increases, the expected return on an investment should increase as well, an increase known as the risk premium. In other words, investors should expect a higher return on an investment when that investment carries a higher level of risk or uncertainty. When evaluating investments, investors should estimate both the expected return and the uncertainty of future returns. Standard deviation provides a quantified estimate of the uncertainty of future returns.

For example, assume an investor had to choose between two stocks. Stock A over the past 20 years had an average return of 10 percent, with a standard deviation of 20 percentage points (pp) and Stock B, over the same period, had average returns of 12 percent but a higher standard deviation of 30 pp. On the basis of risk and return, an investor may decide that Stock A is the safer choice, because Stock B&#x27;s additional two percentage points of return is not worth the additional 10 pp standard deviation (greater risk or uncertainty of the expected return). Stock B is likely to fall short of the initial investment (but also to exceed the initial investment) more often than Stock A under the same circumstances, and is estimated to return only two percent more on average. In this example, Stock A is expected to earn about 10 percent, plus or minus 20 pp (a range of 30 percent to −10 percent), about two-thirds of the future year returns. When considering more extreme possible returns or outcomes in future, an investor should expect results of as much as 10 percent plus or minus 60 pp, or a range from 70 percent to −50 percent, which includes outcomes for three standard deviations from the average return (about 99.7 percent of probable returns).

Calculating the average (or arithmetic mean) of the return of a security over a given period will generate the expected return of the asset. For each period, subtracting the expected return from the actual return results in the difference from the mean. Squaring the difference in each period and taking the average gives the overall variance of the return of the asset. The larger the variance, the greater risk the security carries. Finding the square root of this variance will give the standard deviation of the investment tool in question.

Financial time series are known to be non-stationary series, whereas the statistical calculations above, such as standard deviation, apply only to stationary series. To apply the above statistical tools to non-stationary series, the series first must be transformed to a stationary series, enabling use of statistical tools that now have a valid basis from which to work.

===Geometric interpretation===
To gain some geometric insights and clarification, we will start with a population of three values, . This defines a point in . Consider the line . This is the &quot;main diagonal&quot; going through the origin. If our three given values were all equal, then the standard deviation would be zero and would lie on . So it is not unreasonable to assume that the standard deviation is related to the &quot;distance&quot; of to . That is indeed the case. To move orthogonally from to the point , one begins at the point:

formula_44

whose coordinates are the mean of the values we started out with. 

formula_45 is on formula_46 therefore formula_47 for some formula_48.

The line is to be orthogonal to the vector from to . Therefore:

formula_49
A little algebra shows that the distance between and (which is the same as the orthogonal distance between and the line ) formula_50 is equal to the standard deviation of the vector , multiplied by the square root of the number of dimensions of the vector (3 in this case).

===Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality===

An observation is rarely more than a few standard deviations away from the mean. Chebyshev&#x27;s inequality ensures that, for all distributions for which the standard deviation is defined, the amount of data within a number of standard deviations of the mean is at least as much as given in the following table.

===Rules for normally distributed data===
The central limit theorem states that the distribution of an average of many independent, identically distributed random variables tends toward the famous bell-shaped normal distribution with a probability density function of

formula_51

where is the expected value of the random variables, equals their distribution&#x27;s standard deviation divided by , and is the number of random variables. The standard deviation therefore is simply a scaling variable that adjusts how broad the curve will be, though it also appears in the normalizing constant.

If a data distribution is approximately normal, then the proportion of data values within standard deviations of the mean is defined by:

formula_52

where formula_53 is the error function. The proportion that is less than or equal to a number, , is given by the cumulative distribution function:

formula_54

If a data distribution is approximately normal then about 68 percent of the data values are within one standard deviation of the mean (mathematically, , where is the arithmetic mean), about 95 percent are within two standard deviations (), and about 99.7 percent lie within three standard deviations (). This is known as the &quot;68–95–99.7 rule&quot;, or &quot;the empirical rule&quot;.

For various values of , the percentage of values expected to lie in and outside the symmetric interval, , are as follows:

== Standard deviation matrix ==
The standard deviation matrix formula_55 is the extension of the standard deviation to multiple dimensions. It is the symmetric square root of the covariance matrix formula_56.

formula_55 linearly scales a random vector in multiple dimensions in the same way that formula_58 does in one dimension. A scalar random variable formula_59 with variance formula_60 can be written as formula_61, where formula_62 has unit variance. In the same way, a random vector formula_63 in several dimensions with covariance formula_56 can be written as formula_65, where formula_66 is a normalized variable with identity covariance formula_67. This requires that formula_68. There are then infinite solutions for formula_55, and consequently there are multiple ways to whiten the distribution. The symmetric square root of formula_56 is one of the solutions.

For example, a multivariate normal vector formula_71 can be defined as formula_72, where formula_73 is the multivariate standard normal.

=== Properties ===

* The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of formula_55 correspond to the axes of the 1 sd error ellipsoid of the multivariate normal distribution. See &quot;Multivariate normal distribution: geometric interpretation&quot;.
* The standard deviation of the &quot;projection&quot; of the multivariate distribution (i.e. the marginal distribution) on to a line in the direction of the unit vector formula_75 equals formula_76. 
* The standard deviation of a &quot;slice&quot; of the multivariate distribution (i.e. the conditional distribution) along the line in the direction of the unit vector formula_75 equals formula_78. 
* The discriminability index between two equal-covariance distributions is their Mahalanobis distance, which can also be expressed in terms of the sd matrix: formula_79, where formula_80 is the mean-difference vector.
* Since formula_55 scales a normalized variable, it can be used to invert the transformation, and make it decorrelated and unit-variance: formula_82 has zero mean and identity covariance. This is called the Mahalanobis whitening transform.

==Relationship between standard deviation and mean==
The mean and the standard deviation of a set of data are descriptive statistics usually reported together. In a certain sense, the standard deviation is a &quot;natural&quot; measure of statistical dispersion if the center of the data is measured about the mean. This is because the standard deviation from the mean is smaller than from any other point. The precise statement is the following: suppose are real numbers and define the function:

formula_83

Using calculus or by completing the square, it is possible to show that has a unique minimum at the mean:

formula_84

Variability can also be measured by the coefficient of variation, which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean. It is a dimensionless number.

===Standard deviation of the mean===

Often, we want some information about the precision of the mean we obtained. We can obtain this by determining the standard deviation of the sampled mean. Assuming statistical independence of the values in the sample, the standard deviation of the mean is related to the standard deviation of the distribution by:

formula_85

where is the number of observations in the sample used to estimate the mean. This can easily be proven with (see basic properties of the variance):
formula_86

(Statistical independence is assumed.)
formula_87

hence
formula_88

Resulting in:
formula_89

In order to estimate the standard deviation of the mean it is necessary to know the standard deviation of the entire population beforehand. However, in most applications this parameter is unknown. For example, if a series of 10 measurements of a previously unknown quantity is performed in a laboratory, it is possible to calculate the resulting sample mean and sample standard deviation, but it is impossible to calculate the standard deviation of the mean. However, one can estimate the standard deviation of the entire population from the sample, and thus obtain an estimate for the standard error of the mean.

==Rapid calculation methods==

The following two formulas can represent a running (repeatedly updated) standard deviation. A set of two power sums and are computed over a set of values of , denoted as :

formula_90

Given the results of these running summations, the values , , can be used at any time to compute the &quot;current&quot; value of the running standard deviation:

formula_91

Where , as mentioned above, is the size of the set of values (or can also be regarded as ).

Similarly for sample standard deviation,

formula_92

In a computer implementation, as the two sums become large, we need to consider round-off error, arithmetic overflow, and arithmetic underflow. The method below calculates the running sums method with reduced rounding errors. This is a &quot;one pass&quot; algorithm for calculating variance of samples without the need to store prior data during the calculation. Applying this method to a time series will result in successive values of standard deviation corresponding to data points as grows larger with each new sample, rather than a constant-width sliding window calculation.

For :

formula_93

where is the mean value.
formula_94

Note: since or .

Sample variance:
formula_95

Population variance:
formula_96

===Weighted calculation===

When the values formula_97 are weighted with unequal weights formula_98, the power sums are each computed as:

formula_99

And the standard deviation equations remain unchanged. is now the sum of the weights and not the number of samples .

The incremental method with reduced rounding errors can also be applied, with some additional complexity.

A running sum of weights must be computed for each from 1 to :
formula_100

and places where is used above must be replaced by formula_101:
formula_102

In the final division,
formula_103

and
formula_104

or 
formula_105

where is the total number of elements, and is the number of elements with non-zero weights.

The above formulas become equal to the simpler formulas given above if weights are taken as equal to one.

==History==
The term &quot;standard deviation&quot; was first used in writing by Karl Pearson in 1894, following his use of it in lectures. This was as a replacement for earlier alternative names for the same idea: for example, Gauss used &quot;mean error&quot;.

==Standard deviation index==
The standard deviation index (SDI) is used in external quality assessments, particularly for medical laboratories. It is calculated as:
formula_106

==Alternatives==
Standard deviation is algebraically simpler, though in practice less robust, than the average absolute deviation.

<doc id="27592" wikidata="Q7604383" url="?curid=27592" title="Statistical assumption">
<text>Statistics, like all mathematical disciplines, does not infer valid conclusions from nothing. Inferring interesting conclusions about real statistical populations almost always requires some background assumptions. Those assumptions must be made carefully, because incorrect assumptions can generate wildly inaccurate conclusions.

Here are some examples of statistical assumptions:

*Independence of observations from each other (this assumption is an especially common error).
*Independence of observational error from potential confounding effects.
*Exact or approximate normality of observations (or errors).
*Linearity of graded responses to quantitative stimuli, e.g., in linear regression.

==Classes of assumptions==
There are two approaches to statistical inference: &quot;model-based inference&quot; and &quot;design-based inference&quot;. Both approaches rely on some statistical model to represent the data-generating process. In the model-based approach, the model is taken to be initially unknown, and one of the goals is to select an appropriate model for inference. In the design-based approach, the model is taken to be known, and one of the goals is to ensure that the sample data are selected randomly enough for inference.

Statistical assumptions can be put into two classes, depending upon which approach to inference is used.
*Model-based assumptions. These include the following three types:
**Distributional assumptions. Where a statistical model involves terms relating to random errors, assumptions may be made about the probability distribution of these errors. In some cases, the distributional assumption relates to the observations themselves.
**Structural assumptions. Statistical relationships between variables are often modelled by equating one variable to a function of another (or several others), plus a random error. Models often involve making a structural assumption about the form of the functional relationship, e.g. as in linear regression. This can be generalised to models involving relationships between underlying unobserved latent variables.
**Cross-variation assumptions. These assumptions involve the joint probability distributions of either the observations themselves or the random errors in a model. Simple models may include the assumption that observations or errors are statistically independent.
*Design-based assumptions. These relate to the way observations have been gathered, and often involve an assumption of randomization during sampling.

The model-based approach is the most commonly used in statistical inference; the design-based approach is used mainly with survey sampling. With the model-based approach, all the assumptions are effectively encoded in the model.

==Checking assumptions==
Given that the validity of any conclusion drawn from a statistical inference depends on the validity of the assumptions made, it is clearly important that those assumptions should be reviewed at some stage. Some instances—for example where data are lacking—may require that researchers judge whether an assumption is reasonable. Researchers can expand this somewhat to consider what effect a departure from the assumptions might produce. Where more extensive data are available, various types of procedures for statistical model validation are available—e.g. for regression model validation.

==Example: Independence of Observations==
Scenario:
Imagine a study assessing the effectiveness of a new teaching method in multiple classrooms. If the classrooms are not treated as independent entities, but rather as a single unit, the assumption of independence is violated. Students within the same classroom may share common characteristics or experiences, leading to correlated observations.

Consequence:
Failure to account for this lack of independence may inflate the perceived impact of the teaching method, as the outcomes within a classroom may be more similar than assumed. This can result in an overestimation of the method&#x27;s generalizability to diverse educational settings.

<text>Independence is a fundamental notion in probability theory, as in statistics and the theory of stochastic processes. Two events are independent, statistically independent, or stochastically independent if, informally speaking, the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of occurrence of the other or, equivalently, does not affect the odds. Similarly, two random variables are independent if the realization of one does not affect the probability distribution of the other.

When dealing with collections of more than two events, two notions of independence need to be distinguished. The events are called pairwise independent if any two events in the collection are independent of each other, while mutual independence (or collective independence) of events means, informally speaking, that each event is independent of any combination of other events in the collection. A similar notion exists for collections of random variables. Mutual independence implies pairwise independence, but not the other way around. In the standard literature of probability theory, statistics, and stochastic processes, independence without further qualification usually refers to mutual independence.

==Definition==
===For events===
====Two events====
Two events formula_1 and formula_2 are independent (often written as formula_3 or formula_4, where the latter symbol often is also used for conditional independence) if and only if their joint probability equals the product of their probabilities:

formula_5 indicates that two independent events formula_1 and formula_2 have common elements in their sample space so that they are not mutually exclusive (mutually exclusive iff formula_8). Why this defines independence is made clear by rewriting with conditional probabilities formula_9 as the probability at which the event formula_1 occurs provided that the event formula_2 has or is assumed to have occurred:

:formula_12

and similarly

:formula_13

Thus, the occurrence of formula_2 does not affect the probability of formula_1, and vice versa. In other words, formula_1 and formula_2 are independent of each other. Although the derived expressions may seem more intuitive, they are not the preferred definition, as the conditional probabilities may be undefined if formula_18 or formula_19 are 0. Furthermore, the preferred definition makes clear by symmetry that when formula_1 is independent of formula_2, formula_2 is also independent of formula_1.

====Odds====
Stated in terms of odds, two events are independent if and only if the odds ratio of and is unity (1). Analogously with probability, this is equivalent to the conditional odds being equal to the unconditional odds:
:formula_24
or to the odds of one event, given the other event, being the same as the odds of the event, given the other event not occurring:
:formula_25
The odds ratio can be defined as
:formula_26
or symmetrically for odds of given , and thus is 1 if and only if the events are independent.

====More than two events====
A finite set of events formula_27 is pairwise independent if every pair of events is independent—that is, if and only if for all distinct pairs of indices formula_28,

A finite set of events is mutually independent if every event is independent of any intersection of the other events—that is, if and only if for every formula_29 and for every k indices formula_30,

This is called the &quot;multiplication rule&quot; for independent events. It is not a single condition involving only the product of all the probabilities of all single events; it must hold true for all subsets of events.

For more than two events, a mutually independent set of events is (by definition) pairwise independent; but the converse is not necessarily true.

====Log probability and information content====
Stated in terms of log probability, two events are independent if and only if the log probability of the joint event is the sum of the log probability of the individual events:
:formula_31
In information theory, negative log probability is interpreted as information content, and thus two events are independent if and only if the information content of the combined event equals the sum of information content of the individual events:
:formula_32
See &quot;&quot; for details.

===For real valued random variables===
====Two random variables====
Two random variables formula_33 and formula_34 are independent if and only if (iff) the elements of the -system generated by them are independent; that is to say, for every formula_35 and formula_36, the events formula_37 and formula_38 are independent events (as defined above in ). That is, formula_33 and formula_34 with cumulative distribution functions formula_41 and formula_42, are independent iff the combined random variable formula_43 has a joint cumulative distribution function

or equivalently, if the probability densities formula_44 and formula_45 and the joint probability density formula_46 exist,

:formula_47

====More than two random variables====
A finite set of formula_48 random variables formula_49 is pairwise independent if and only if every pair of random variables is independent. Even if the set of random variables is pairwise independent, it is not necessarily &quot;mutually independent&quot; as defined next.

A finite set of formula_48 random variables formula_49 is mutually independent if and only if for any sequence of numbers formula_52, the events formula_53 are mutually independent events (as defined above in ). This is equivalent to the following condition on the joint cumulative distribution function A finite set of formula_48 random variables formula_49 is mutually independent if and only if

It is not necessary here to require that the probability distribution factorizes for all possible subsets as in the case for formula_48 events. This is not required because e.g. formula_57 implies formula_58.

The measure-theoretically inclined reader may prefer to substitute events formula_59 for events formula_60 in the above definition, where formula_1 is any Borel set. That definition is exactly equivalent to the one above when the values of the random variables are real numbers. It has the advantage of working also for complex-valued random variables or for random variables taking values in any measurable space (which includes topological spaces endowed by appropriate σ-algebras).

===For real valued random vectors===
Two random vectors formula_62 and formula_63 are called independent if

(\mathbf{x}) \cdot F_{\mathbf{Y}}(\mathbf{y}) \quad \text{for all } \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}&lt;/math&gt;|}}
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

where formula_64 and formula_65 denote the cumulative distribution functions of formula_66 and formula_67 and formula_68 denotes their joint cumulative distribution function. Independence of formula_66 and formula_67 is often denoted by formula_71.
Written component-wise, formula_66 and formula_67 are called independent if
:formula_74

===For stochastic processes===
====For one stochastic process====
The definition of independence may be extended from random vectors to a stochastic process. Therefore, it is required for an independent stochastic process that the random variables obtained by sampling the process at any formula_48 times formula_76 are independent random variables for any formula_48.

Formally, a stochastic process formula_78 is called independent, if and only if for all formula_79 and for all formula_80

(x_1) \cdot \ldots \cdot F_{X_{t_n}}(x_n) \quad \text{for all } x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;|}}
|cellpadding= 6
|border
|border colour = #0073CF
|background colour=#F5FFFA}}

where (x_1,\ldots,x_n) = \mathrm{P}(X(t_1) \leq x_1,\ldots,X(t_n) \leq x_n)&lt;/math&gt;.}} Independence of a stochastic process is a property &quot;within&quot; a stochastic process, not between two stochastic processes.

====For two stochastic processes====
Independence of two stochastic processes is a property between two stochastic processes formula_78 and formula_82 that are defined on the same probability space formula_83. Formally, two stochastic processes formula_78 and formula_82 are said to be independent if for all formula_79 and for all formula_80, the random vectors formula_88 and formula_89 are independent, i.e. if

(x_1,\ldots,x_n) \cdot F_{Y_{t_1},\ldots,Y_{t_n}}(y_1,\ldots,y_n) \quad \text{for all } x_1,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt;|}}

===Independent σ-algebras===
The definitions above ( and ) are both generalized by the following definition of independence for σ-algebras. Let formula_90 be a probability space and let formula_91 and formula_92 be two sub-σ-algebras of formula_93. formula_91 and formula_92 are said to be independent if, whenever formula_96 and formula_97,

:formula_98

Likewise, a finite family of σ-algebras formula_99, where formula_100 is an index set, is said to be independent if and only if

:formula_101

and an infinite family of σ-algebras is said to be independent if all its finite subfamilies are independent.

The new definition relates to the previous ones very directly:
* Two events are independent (in the old sense) if and only if the σ-algebras that they generate are independent (in the new sense). The σ-algebra generated by an event formula_102 is, by definition,
::formula_103
* Two random variables formula_33 and formula_34 defined over formula_106 are independent (in the old sense) if and only if the σ-algebras that they generate are independent (in the new sense). The σ-algebra generated by a random variable formula_33 taking values in some measurable space formula_108 consists, by definition, of all subsets of formula_106 of the form formula_110, where formula_111 is any measurable subset of formula_108.

Using this definition, it is easy to show that if formula_33 and formula_34 are random variables and formula_34 is constant, then formula_33 and formula_34 are independent, since the σ-algebra generated by a constant random variable is the trivial σ-algebra formula_118. Probability zero events cannot affect independence so independence also holds if formula_34 is only Pr-almost surely constant.

==Properties==
===Self-independence===
Note that an event is independent of itself if and only if

:formula_120

Thus an event is independent of itself if and only if it almost surely occurs or its complement almost surely occurs; this fact is useful when proving zero–one laws.

===Expectation and covariance===

If formula_33 and formula_34 are statistically independent random variables, then the expectation operator formula_123 has the property

:formula_124

and the covariance formula_125 is zero, as follows from

:formula_126

The converse does not hold: if two random variables have a covariance of 0 they still may be not independent. 

Similarly for two stochastic processes formula_78 and formula_82: If they are independent, then they are uncorrelated.

===Characteristic function===
Two random variables formula_33 and formula_34 are independent if and only if the characteristic function of the random vector formula_43 satisfies
:formula_132

In particular the characteristic function of their sum is the product of their marginal characteristic functions:
:formula_133

though the reverse implication is not true. Random variables that satisfy the latter condition are called subindependent.

==Examples==
===Rolling dice===
The event of getting a 6 the first time a die is rolled and the event of getting a 6 the second time are &quot;independent&quot;. By contrast, the event of getting a 6 the first time a die is rolled and the event that the sum of the numbers seen on the first and second trial is 8 are &quot;not&quot; independent.

===Drawing cards===
If two cards are drawn &quot;with&quot; replacement from a deck of cards, the event of drawing a red card on the first trial and that of drawing a red card on the second trial are &quot;independent&quot;. By contrast, if two cards are drawn &quot;without&quot; replacement from a deck of cards, the event of drawing a red card on the first trial and that of drawing a red card on the second trial are &quot;not&quot; independent, because a deck that has had a red card removed has proportionately fewer red cards.

===Pairwise and mutual independence===

Consider the two probability spaces shown. In both cases, formula_134 and formula_135. The events in the first space are pairwise independent because formula_136, formula_137, and formula_138; but the three events are not mutually independent. The events in the second space are both pairwise independent and mutually independent. To illustrate the difference, consider conditioning on two events. In the pairwise independent case, although any one event is independent of each of the other two individually, it is not independent of the intersection of the other two:

:formula_139
:formula_140
:formula_141

In the mutually independent case, however,
:formula_142
:formula_143
:formula_144

===Triple-independence but no pairwise-independence===
It is possible to create a three-event example in which

:formula_145

and yet no two of the three events are pairwise independent (and hence the set of events are not mutually independent). This example shows that mutual independence involves requirements on the products of probabilities of all combinations of events, not just the single events as in this example.

==Conditional independence==
===For events===
The events formula_1 and formula_2 are conditionally independent given an event formula_148 when

formula_149.

===For random variables===
Intuitively, two random variables formula_33 and formula_34 are conditionally independent given formula_152 if, once formula_152 is known, the value of formula_34 does not add any additional information about formula_33. For instance, two measurements formula_33 and formula_34 of the same underlying quantity formula_152 are not independent, but they are conditionally independent given formula_152 (unless the errors in the two measurements are somehow connected).

The formal definition of conditional independence is based on the idea of conditional distributions. If formula_33, formula_34, and formula_152 are discrete random variables, then we define formula_33 and formula_34 to be conditionally independent given formula_152 if

:formula_166

for all formula_35, formula_36 and formula_169 such that formula_170. On the other hand, if the random variables are continuous and have a joint probability density function formula_171, then formula_33 and formula_34 are conditionally independent given formula_152 if

:formula_175

for all real numbers formula_35, formula_36 and formula_169 such that formula_179.

If discrete formula_33 and formula_34 are conditionally independent given formula_152, then

:formula_183

for any formula_35, formula_36 and formula_169 with formula_170. That is, the conditional distribution for formula_33 given formula_34 and formula_152 is the same as that given formula_152 alone. A similar equation holds for the conditional probability density functions in the continuous case.

Independence can be seen as a special kind of conditional independence, since probability can be seen as a kind of conditional probability given no events.

== History ==
Before 1933, independence, in probability theory, was defined in a verbal manner. For example, de Moivre gave the following definition: “Two events are independent, when they have no connexion one with the other, and that the happening of one neither forwards nor obstructs the happening of the other”. If there are n independent events, the probability of the event, that all of them happen was computed as the product of the probabilities of these n events. Apparently, there was the conviction, that this formula was a consequence of the above definition. (Sometimes this was called the Multiplication Theorem.), Of course, a proof of his assertion cannot work without further more formal tacit assumptions.

The definition of independence, given in this article, became the standard definition (now used in all books) after it appeared in 1933 as part of Kolmogorov&#x27;s axiomatization of probability. Kolmogorov credited it to S.N. Bernstein, and quoted a publication which had appeared in Russian in 1927.

Unfortunately, both Bernstein and Kolmogorov had not been aware of the work of the Georg Bohlmann. Bohlmann had given the same definition for two events in 1901 and for n events in 1908 In the latter paper, he studied his notion in detail. For example, he gave the first example showing that pairwise independence does not imply mutual independence.
Even today, Bohlmann is rarely quoted. More about his work can be found in &quot;On the contributions of Georg Bohlmann to probability theory&quot; from :de:Ulrich Krengel.

<text>Sherrie Veronica Krenn (born 28 August 1970), known professionally as Sherrié Austin (formerly known as Sherrie Krenn), is an Australian actress and country music singer. Active as a singer since her teenage years, Austin initially recorded as one half of the duo Colourhaus, which also featured Phil Radford. After leaving Colourhaus, she moved to the United States in pursuit of a solo career. There, she recorded five studio albums, and charted several singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs charts. Her highest charting single was the No. 18 &quot;Streets of Heaven&quot; in 2003. Her most recent album was released on 15 November 2011.

==Career==
===Early career===
Austin got her start in music opening for Johnny Cash in Australia at the age of 14. She later moved to the United States where she took up acting. She is most known in the United States for playing the role of Pippa McKenna on &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; during its final season.

In 1991, she appeared as &quot;Lady Penelope&quot; on episode No. 20 of the first season of the television comedy series &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot;. In the 1990s, she started a singing career, teaming up with Phil Radford in 1992, to form a duo, Colourhaus, which released one album, &quot;Water to the Soul&quot;. The song &quot;Innocent Child&quot; taken from that album was issued as a single, with &quot;We Talk to the Angels&quot; on the B-side, and it peaked at No. 50 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The Colourhaus song &quot;Colour Me You&quot; was on the soundtrack of the &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; episode of the television series &quot;Baywatch&quot; on 5 October 1992.

===Nashville move===
Afterwards, Austin moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in country music. Her first solo contract was with Arista Nashville, with the album &quot;Words&quot; being released in 1997. It produced singles in &quot;Lucky in Love&quot;, &quot;One Solitary Tear&quot;, &quot;Put Your Heart into It&quot;, and &quot;Innocent Man&quot;. &quot;Lucky in Love&quot; and &quot;Put Your Heart into It&quot; both reached Top 40 on the country charts with a peak of No. 34 each.

Her second and final album for Arista was 1999&#x27;s &quot;Love in the Real World&quot;, led off by the No. 29 &quot;Never Been Kissed&quot;, which was followed by &quot;Little Bird&quot;. After RCA acquired Arista Records, Austin&#x27;s publishing company, Reynsong Publishing, formed Wrensong Entertainment and signed to Madacy Entertainment for her next album, &quot;Followin&#x27; a Feelin&#x27;&quot;, which produced another single in its lead-off single, a cover of Dolly Parton&#x27;s &quot;Jolene&quot;.

Later, she switched to the independent Broken Bow Records label. Her fourth album of country music, titled &quot;Streets of Heaven&quot;, produced her biggest country hit in its title track. Following this single was &quot;Son of a Preacher Man&quot;, a cover of the Dusty Springfield song, which was never included on an album.

===Broadway years===
Austin moved to New York City in 2005 and appeared in the New York Musical Theater Festival&#x27;s production of &quot;Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that she was &quot;a sultry young country music singer who plays the notorious criminal Bonnie Parker and does for this musical what Reba McEntire did for the 1999 revival of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun.&quot; That twang in her voice provides some much-needed authenticity in excellent pop-country numbers like &quot;Ain&#x27;t Goin&#x27; Back.&quot; And it&#x27;s easy to tell by her hip-swiveling poses that this is a woman who knows how to hold a stage.&quot;

The following year, Austin performed in &quot;Ring of Fire – The Johnny Cash Musical Show&quot; at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. She also performed in the production of &quot;Warrior&quot;, a musical about the American-Indian athlete Jim Thorpe, where CurtainUp.com described her as &quot;outstanding&quot;. She returned to Nashville in 2006.

===Nashville return===
Austin co-wrote Danielle Peck&#x27;s 2007 single &quot;Bad for Me&quot;, the title track to Blake Shelton&#x27;s 2008 album &quot;Startin&#x27; Fires&quot;, George Strait&#x27;s &quot;Where Have I Been All My Life&quot; off his 2009 album &quot;Twang&quot;, and Tim McGraw&#x27;s duet, with wife Faith Hill, &quot;Shotgun Rider&quot; off his &quot;Let It Go&quot; album in 2007. Austin left Broken Bow in 2008.

She was named one of 2011&#x27;s &quot;25 Most Beautiful People&quot; by &quot;Nashville Lifestyles Magazine&quot;.

In summer 2011, The Sundance Channel announced that Austin and her friend Shane Stevens would be on the second season of &quot;Girls Who Like Boys Who Like Boys&quot;, which was filmed in Nashville and features women and their gay best friends. The season started 18 November 2011.

===&quot;Circus Girl&quot; (2011)===
Austin&#x27;s most recent album, &quot;Circus Girl&quot;, her first in eight years, is described as a series of stories interpreted by a strong woman, about women, and for women. Austin feels it&#x27;s something her female fans have been clamouring for, for quite some time.

&quot;The last few years I had been complaining about that fact that there weren’t any females speaking to women above the age of 30, so I started thinking about how I was writing my songs and came up with the idea for &quot;Friday Night Girls&quot;... I wanted to write a three-minute song with every &quot;Sex and the City&quot; episode that had ever existed, so I did. I quickly noticed that the women in my audiences loved it and so I switched my songwriting focus for a while to concentrate on that audience, who are my peers, to speak to them&quot;, says Austin.

&quot;Circus Girl&quot; was released independently on 15 November 2011.

<text>In statistics, stratified sampling is a method of sampling from a population which can be partitioned into subpopulations.
In statistical surveys, when subpopulations within an overall population vary, it could be advantageous to sample each subpopulation (stratum) independently. 

Stratification is the process of dividing members of the population into homogeneous subgroups before sampling. The strata should define a partition of the population. That is, it should be &quot;collectively exhaustive&quot; and &quot;mutually exclusive&quot;: every element in the population must be assigned to one and only one stratum. Then sampling is done in each stratum, for example: by simple random sampling. The objective is to improve the precision of the sample by reducing sampling error. It can produce a weighted mean that has less variability than the arithmetic mean of a simple random sample of the population.

In computational statistics, stratified sampling is a method of variance reduction when Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate population statistics from a known population.

== Example==
Assume that we need to estimate the average number of votes for each candidate in an election. Assume that a country has 3 towns: Town A has 1 million factory workers, Town B has 2 million office workers and Town C has 3 million retirees. We can choose to get a random sample of size 60 over the entire population but there is some chance that the resulting random sample is poorly balanced across these towns and hence is biased, causing a significant error in estimation (when the outcome of interest has a different distribution, in terms of the parameter of interest, between the towns). Instead, if we choose to take a random sample of 10, 20 and 30 from Town A, B and C respectively, then we can produce a smaller error in estimation for the same total sample size. This method is generally used when a population is not a homogeneous group.

==Strategies==
#&quot;Proportionate allocation&quot; uses a sampling fraction in each of the strata that are proportional to that of the total population. For instance, if the population consists of &quot;n&quot; total individuals, &quot;m&quot; of which are male and &quot;f&quot; female (and where &quot;m&quot; + &quot;f&quot; = &quot;n&quot;), then the relative size of the two samples (&quot;x&quot;1 = &quot;m&quot;/&quot;n&quot; males, &quot;x&quot;2 = &quot;f&quot;/&quot;n&quot; females) should reflect this proportion.
#&quot;Optimum allocation&quot; (or &quot;disproportionate allocation&quot;) – The sampling fraction of each stratum is proportionate to both the proportion (as above) and the standard deviation of the distribution of the variable. Larger samples are taken in the strata with the greatest variability to generate the least possible overall sampling variance.

A real-world example of using stratified sampling would be for a political survey. If the respondents needed to reflect the diversity of the population, the researcher would specifically seek to include participants of various minority groups such as race or religion, based on their proportionality to the total population as mentioned above. A stratified survey could thus claim to be more representative of the population than a survey of simple random sampling or systematic sampling. Both mean and variance can be corrected for disproportionate sampling costs using stratified sample sizes.

==Advantages==
The reasons to use stratified sampling rather than simple random sampling include
# If measurements within strata have a lower standard deviation (as compared to the overall standard deviation in the population), stratification gives a smaller error in estimation.
# For many applications, measurements become more manageable and/or cheaper when the population is grouped into strata.
# When it is desirable to have estimates of the population parameters for groups within the population – stratified sampling verifies we have enough samples from the strata of interest.
If the population density varies greatly within a region, stratified sampling will ensure that estimates can be made with equal accuracy in different parts of the region, and that comparisons of sub-regions can be made with equal statistical power. For example, in Ontario a survey taken throughout the province might use a larger sampling fraction in the less populated north, since the disparity in population between north and south is so great that a sampling fraction based on the provincial sample as a whole might result in the collection of only a handful of data from the north.

==Disadvantages==
It would be a misapplication of the technique to make subgroups&#x27; sample sizes proportional to the amount of data available from the subgroups, rather than scaling sample sizes to subgroup sizes (or to their variances, if known to vary significantly—e.g. using an F test). Data representing each subgroup are taken to be of equal importance if suspected variation among them warrants stratified sampling. If subgroup variances differ significantly and the data needs to be stratified by variance, it is not possible to simultaneously make each subgroup sample size proportional to subgroup size within the total population. For an efficient way to partition sampling resources among groups that vary in their means, variance and costs, see &quot;optimum allocation&quot;.
The problem of stratified sampling in the case of unknown class priors (ratio of subpopulations in the entire population) can have a deleterious effect on the performance of any analysis on the dataset, e.g. classification. In that regard, minimax sampling ratio can be used to make the dataset robust with respect to uncertainty in the underlying data generating process.

Combining sub-strata to ensure adequate numbers can lead to Simpson&#x27;s paradox, where trends that exist in different groups of data disappear or even reverse when the groups are combined.

== Mean and standard error ==
The mean and variance of stratified random sampling are given by:

:formula_1

:formula_2

where

:formula_3number of strata

:formula_4the sum of all stratum sizes

:formula_5size of stratum formula_6

:formula_7sample mean of stratum formula_6

:formula_9number of observations in stratum formula_6

:formula_11sample standard deviation of stratum formula_6

Note that the term formula_13, which equals formula_14, is a finite population correction and formula_15 must be expressed in &quot;sample units&quot;. Foregoing the finite population correction gives:

:formula_16

where the formula_17 is the population weight of stratum formula_6.

==Sample size allocation==
For the proportional allocation strategy, the size of the sample in each stratum is taken in proportion to the size of the stratum. Suppose that in a company there are the following staff:
*male, full-time: 90
*male, part-time: 18
*female, full-time: 9
*female, part-time: 63
*total: 180

and we are asked to take a sample of 40 staff, stratified according to the above categories.

The first step is to calculate the percentage of each group of the total.
*% male, full-time = 90 ÷ 180 = 50%
*% male, part-time = 18 ÷ 180 = 10%
*% female, full-time = 9 ÷ 180 = 5%
*% female, part-time = 63 ÷ 180 = 35%

This tells us that of our sample of 40,
*50% (20 individuals) should be male, full-time.
*10% (4 individuals) should be male, part-time.
*5% (2 individuals) should be female, full-time.
*35% (14 individuals) should be female, part-time.

Another easy way without having to calculate the percentage is to multiply each group size by the sample size and divide by the total population size (size of entire staff):
* male, full-time = 90 × (40 ÷ 180) = 20
* male, part-time = 18 × (40 ÷ 180) = 4
* female, full-time = 9 × (40 ÷ 180) = 2
* female, part-time = 63 × (40 ÷ 180) = 14

<text>The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, doing business as Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association and commonly known as SFWA ( or ) is a nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization of professional science fiction and fantasy writers. While SFWA is based in the United States, its membership is open to writers worldwide. The organization was founded in 1965 by Damon Knight under the name Science Fiction Writers of America.

 SFWA has about 2,500 members worldwide.

Active SFWA members may vote for the Nebula Awards, one of the principal English-language science fiction awards.

==Mission==
SFWA informs, supports, promotes, defends and advocates for its members.

SFWA activities include informing science fiction and fantasy writers on professional matters, protecting their interests, and helping them deal effectively with agents, editors, anthologists, and producers in print and non-print media; encouraging public interest in and appreciation for science fiction and fantasy literature; sponsoring, editing, and disseminating writings, papers, books, pamphlets, and other publications which exemplify science fiction and fantasy literature of high quality; conducting conferences, public discussion groups, forums, lectures, and seminar programs; and furnishing services connected with this stated purpose.

==History==
Science Fiction Writers of America, Inc. was founded in 1965 by Damon Knight in association with a group of writers connected to the Milford Conference, which he also headed. According to Todd McCaffrey, the organization immediately &quot;acquired great status in its efforts to help J.R.R. Tolkien get fair recompense in America for pirated sales of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;&quot;. In 1991, the name of the organization was changed to Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, to reflect the fact that the organization had always included writers working in multiple genres. After the name change, both SFWA and SFFWA were used as acronyms. The acronym SFWA was re-established officially in 1996.

In 1973, SFWA awarded an honorary membership to Polish author Stanisław Lem. Some SFWA members, notably Philip José Farmer, were incensed by Lem&#x27;s negative opinions of American science fiction, while others opposed Lem&#x27;s membership because he lived in a Communist country. As a result, in 1976 SFWA rescinded Lem&#x27;s membership. Several members protested that decision, notably Ursula K. Le Guin, who resigned her membership and refused the Nebula Award for Best Novelette for &quot;The Diary of the Rose&quot;.

In 1982, Lisa Tuttle withdrew her short story &quot;The Bone Flute&quot; from the final Nebula ballot, to protest what she saw as excessive campaigning for awards and that voters did not receive copies of nominated works. Her withdrawal was sent after voting had been completed. When informed she had won, she contacted SFWA and told them she refused to accept it. She was told that her reasons for doing so would be announced. Her publisher accepted the award in her place, apparently with no knowledge of her withdrawal, and there was no mention of her objection.

In September 2009, SFWA joined the Open Book Alliance to oppose the Google Book Settlement. As a party to the class action suit, SFWA had recently explained its reservations about the settlement and declared its intention to file an objection. 

In 2013, the &quot;SFWA Bulletin&quot; was the subject of a controversy about sexism (see below). This led to a brief hiatus, followed by a reboot of the magazine.

In 2014, the original Massachusetts corporation was dissolved and SFWA reincorporated as a California nonprofit 501(c)3 organization with new bylaws.

In 2022, the organization filed to do future business as the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers Association to reflect the participation of their non-US members.

==Activities==
SFWA participates in various trade shows and publishing industry events in the United States and abroad, including BookExpo America, the American Library Association Midwinter Conference, the USA Science &amp; Engineering Festival, and several major (and minor) science fiction, fantasy and media conventions. SFWA holds a semi-annual business meeting at the World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon) when it is held in North America, and at the North American Science Fiction Convention (NASFiC) otherwise.

SFWA also hosts its own events, which include:
*SFWA Nebula Conference: SFWA Nebula Conference is an annual conference during which a banquet is held and Nebula Award winners are announced and presented. Other Nebula Awards Weekend events include a semi-annual SFWA business meeting and a mass autographing session for member authors, which is open to the public. In recent years, an extensive program of panels and workshops for professional writers has been offered. SFWA Nebula Conference, and the earlier Nabula Awards Weekend have been held at different cities throughout the United States. It is held in a different location every two years. It will be held in Los Angeles, CA in 2020, the second year at that location.
*The SFWA Reception in New York: SFWA has hosted an annual reception in New York to provide SFWA members the opportunity to meet and socialize with editors, agents, publicists, art directors and other publishing industry professionals. Over the years, the reception has gone by several names, including Authors and Editors, Mill and Swill, and the NY Reception. The event was put on hold in 2015 because of rising costs.
*The SFWA Reading Series: A series of free quarterly events during which SFWA authors read or discuss their fiction with members of local communities. Currently held in Seattle, WA, Portland, OR, and Philadelphia, PA, but the program may soon expand to other areas.

==Advocacy and support==
As an organization, SFWA acts as an advocate to effect important changes within the publishing industry, especially among publishers of science fiction and fantasy, by promoting author-friendly copyright legislation, equitable treatment of authors, and fair contract terms.

===Writer Beware===
SFWA sponsors Writer Beware, whose mission is to track, expose, and raise awareness of the prevalence of fraud and other questionable activities in and around the publishing industry. Writer Beware exists as a subpage of the SFWA website, which provides the latest information on literary schemes, scams, and pitfalls; the Writer Beware blog, which provides the latest information on literary schemes, scams, and pitfalls; the Writer Beware blog, which provides up-to-the-minute information on specific scams and schemes, along with advice for writers and industry news and commentary; and the Writer Beware Facebook page, which posts links to articles, news items, and warnings of interest to writers, and provides a forum for discussion. Writer Beware receives the support of the Mystery Writers of America and the Horror Writers Association.

Writer Beware maintains an extensive database of complaints on questionable literary agents, publishers, independent editors, writers’ services, contests, publicity services, and others, and offers a free research and information service for writers. Writer Beware staff assist law enforcement agencies with investigations of literary fraud, and have been instrumental in the convictions of several literary scammers.
===Griefcom===
Griefcom, or the Grievance Committee, is formed of member volunteers who undertake to mediate writer disputes and grievances between member writers and their publishers.

===Emergency Medical Fund===
SFWA&#x27;s Emergency Medical Fund was established to assist eligible writers who have unexpected medical expenses.

===Legal Fund===
SFWA&#x27;s Legal Fund was established to create loans for eligible member writers who have writing-related court costs and other related legal expenses.

===Estate Project===
Founded by longtime SFWA member Bud Webster, the Estate Project is now headed by Mishell Baker. It maintains a list of the estates of deceased SFWA member writers and coordinates with living member writers to make arrangements for their future estates. The Estate Project also accumulates information about authors&#x27; archives for member writers, living or dead.29.

==Awards==
*Nebula Awards: Since 1965, SFWA Active and Lifetime Active members select by vote the Nebula Awards for best short story, novelette, novella, and novel published during the previous year, where the four categories are defined by numbers of words. In 2018, a fifth category for game writing was added. 
*Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award: Since 1975, the Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award has been awarded for lifetime achievement in science fiction or fantasy.
*Ray Bradbury Award: Since 1992, the Ray Bradbury Award has been selected by a vote and presented for best dramatic presentation. Named in honor of Ray Bradbury.
*Author Emeritus: From 1995 to 2009, the Author Emeritus title was awarded to a senior writer &quot;in the genres of science fiction and fantasy who made significant contributions to our field but who are no longer active or whose excellent work may no longer be as widely known as it once was.&quot;
*Andre Norton Award: Since 2005, the Andre Norton Award has been selected by a vote and presented for best young adult or middle grade novel. Named in honor of Andre Norton.
*Kevin O&#x27;Donnell Jr. Award for Service to SFWA: Since 1995, presented to recognize service to the organization. Named in honor of Kevin O&#x27;Donnell Jr. in 2009 because of his exemplary service to the organization.
*Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award: Since 2009, SFWA has presented the Solstice Award, which recognizes lifetime contributions to the science fiction and fantasy field. The award can be given to up to three people, but is usually given to one live person and one deceased person. In 2016, the award was renamed the Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award.
*Infinity Award: Since 2023, SFWA has presented the Infinity Award, which posthumously recognizes &quot;acclaimed creators who passed away before they could be considered for a Damon Knight Memorial Grand Master Award.&quot;

==Publications==
===&quot;The SFWA Bulletin&quot;===

&quot;The SFWA Bulletin&quot; is a quarterly magazine that SFWA members receive as part of their membership, but it is also available (by subscription) to non-members. The Bulletin carries nonfiction articles of general interest to writers, especially science fiction and fantasy writers. It accepts submissions, for which the pay rate is 8 cents a word. The current Bulletin editor is Neil Clarke.

In 2013, a controversy about sexism in the &quot;Bulletin&quot; led to the resignation of editor Jean Rabe on June 5, 2013. More than 50 authors wrote blog posts in objection to comments by longtime contributors Mike Resnick and Barry N. Malzberg that included references to &quot;lady editors&quot; and &quot;lady writers&quot; who were &quot;beauty pageant beautiful&quot; or a &quot;knock out&quot;, an article by C. J. Henderson praising Barbie for maintaining &quot;quiet dignity the way a woman should&quot;, and the &quot;exploitative&quot; cover image of no. 200 of the &quot;Bulletin&quot; depicting a woman in a chain-mail bikini. Several authors used the occasion to speak out against sexism in science fiction genre circles more broadly. The controversy continued through Bulletin no. 202, which contained another column by Resnick and Malzberg, discussing the response to their earlier column. Their column framed that response as censorship, referring to their critics as &quot;liberal fascists&quot;. In February 2014 a proposal to establish an advisory board to oversee content was met by a petition circulated by editor and critic Dave Truesdale supporting freedom of speech in the Bulletin.

As a result of the controversy, SFWA president John Scalzi apologized to members, and the &quot;Bulletin&quot; was put on hiatus for six months. It reappeared with the Winter 2014 Special Issue, #203, but has been on a reduced schedule, publishing an average of 2 issues per year.

The special issue was edited by Tansy Rayner Roberts and Jaym Gates and &quot;was specially created to be used as an outreach tool for conventions and other events.&quot; The issue&#x27;s contents and cover were welcomed by some as an antidote to the perceived sexism of past issues though Sue Granquist felt that something looked &quot;suspiciously like a woman in a burka&quot;.

===The Forum Binary===
The Forum Binary is a biannual publication that functions as SFWA&#x27;s internal publication of record for members. As such, it is not available to non-members.

===The SFWA Blog===
SFWA also publishes short essays and other content relevant to writers on the SFWA Blog.

==Membership==
Most members live in the United States but membership is open to qualifying writers worldwide. Authors, regardless of nationality or residence, must be professionally published in a qualifying market as listed by SFWA in order to become SFWA members. At present, all listed qualifying markets publish only in the English language.

<doc id="27606" wikidata="Q973818" url="?curid=27606" title="Soul Coughing">
<text>Soul Coughing is an American alternative rock band composed of vocalist/guitarist Mike Doughty (also known as M. Doughty), keyboardist/sampler Mark Degli Antoni, bassist Sebastian Steinberg, and drummer Yuval Gabay. They developed a devout fanbase and garnered largely positive response from critics. Steve Huey of AllMusic described the band as &quot;One of the most unique cult bands of the &#x27;90s. Driven by frontman M. Doughty&#x27;s stream-of-consciousness poetry, Soul Coughing&#x27;s sound was a willfully idiosyncratic mix of improvisational jazz grooves, oddball samples, hip hop, electronics, and noisy experimentalism&quot;. Doughty described the band&#x27;s sound as &quot;deep slacker jazz&quot;. The group broke up in 2000.

In June 2024, the group announced it would reunite for a United States tour in September and October of the same year. It made its first television appearance in decades on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;.

== Career ==
All four Soul Coughing members were regulars at The Knitting Factory, a New York City nightclub and performance venue that was part of the 1980s and 1990s experimental downtown scene. Doughty was a doorman known for his improvised comedic quasi-raps, while the others appeared at the Knitting Factory in various bands. Doughty, Degli Antoni, and Steinberg all performed in versions of John Zorn&#x27;s composition &quot;Cobra&quot;, appearing on &quot;John Zorn&#x27;s Cobra: Live at the Knitting Factory&quot; (recorded 1992, released 1995).

Within a year of its formation, the band was signed to Slash Records, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Records. The group released three albums: &quot;Ruby Vroom&quot; (1994), &quot;Irresistible Bliss&quot; (1996) and &quot;El Oso&quot; (1998), with the latter showing a marked drum and bass influence. &quot;Irresistible Bliss&quot; and &quot;El Oso&quot; both reached the Billboard 200 albums chart. The band enjoyed minor hit singles with &quot;Soundtrack to Mary&quot; and &quot;Super Bon Bon&quot;.

In 1996, Soul Coughing contributed to the AIDS benefit album &quot;&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization. Also in 1996, one of the group&#x27;s songs, &quot;Unmarked Helicopters&quot;, was included in the &quot;Songs in the Key of X: Music from and Inspired by the X-Files&quot;. The band also placed songs in the soundtracks to the films &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (&quot;The Bug&quot;), &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; (&quot;Is Chicago, Is Not Chicago&quot;) and &quot;Spawn&quot; (&quot;A Plane Scraped It’s Belly On A Sooty Yellow Moon&quot;, featuring. Roni Size). Their song &quot;Super Bon Bon&quot; was included on the soundtrack for the video game &quot;Gran Turismo 2&quot; in 1999.

The 1998 song &quot;Circles&quot; from &quot;El Oso&quot; reached #8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart, and was used as the soundtrack to a Cartoon Network extended commercial that poked fun at repeating cartoon backgrounds.

Soul Coughing broke up in 2000. Mark Degli Antoni moved on to a career as a film score composer, while Mike Doughty began a prolific solo career, occasionally revisiting Soul Coughing songs in new styles.

&quot;Lust in Phaze&quot;, a greatest hits compilation including a few B-sides, was released in 2002. Rhino Records reissued Soul Coughing&#x27;s three studio albums on 180-gram black vinyl in 2015, marking the first time &quot;Ruby Vroom&quot; had been pressed to vinyl. In 2017, Swedish record label Woah Dad! acquired Soul Coughing&#x27;s back catalog from Slash Records.

Soul Coughing was honored with a star on the outside mural of Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, which recognizes performers who have played sold-out shows or otherwise made major cultural contributions to the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis&quot;, according to journalist Steve Marsh. Soul Coughing was especially popular in Minneapolis, thanks to airplay on alternative radio station Rev 105, and regularly performed there to audiences five to ten times larger than in other cities.

In February 2022, Doughty and Steinberg performed together in Los Angeles during Steinberg&#x27;s set for Watkins Family Hour. The duo performed Soul Coughing songs &quot;Super Bon Bon&quot; and &quot;True Dreams of Wichita&quot;, which marked the first occasion members of Soul Coughing appeared on stage together since the split in 2000.

At the end of June 2024, Soul Coughing reformed with all the original members and announced that there would be a short tour with limited shows throughout September and October 2024. On September 12th, in celebration of the 30th anniversary of Ruby Vroom, the band performed &quot;Super Bon Bon&quot; live on Jimmy Kimmel Live.

<text>Science fiction first appeared in television programming in the late 1930s, during what is called the Golden Age of Science Fiction. Special effects and other production techniques allow creators to present a living visual image of an imaginary world not limited by the constraints of reality.

==Visual production process and methods==
The need to portray imaginary settings or characters with properties and abilities beyond the reach of current reality obliges producers to make extensive use of specialized techniques of television production.
Through most of the 20th century, many of these techniques were expensive and involved a small number of dedicated craft practitioners, while the reusability of props, models, effects, or animation techniques made it easier to keep using them. The combination of high initial cost and lower maintenance cost pushed producers into building these techniques into the basic concept of a series, influencing all the artistic choices.

By the late 1990s, improved technology and more training and cross-training within the industry made all of these techniques easier to use, so that directors of individual episodes could make decisions to use one or more methods, so such artistic choices no longer needed to be baked into the series concept.

===Special effects===

Special effects (or &quot;SPFX&quot;) have been an essential tool throughout the history of science fiction on television: small explosives to simulate the effects of various rayguns, squibs of blood and gruesome prosthetics to simulate the monsters and victims in horror series, and the wire-flying entrances and exits of George Reeves as Superman.

The broad term &quot;special effects&quot; includes all the techniques here, but more commonly there are two categories of effects. Visual effects (&quot;VFX&quot;) involve photographic or digital manipulation of the onscreen image, usually done in post-production. Mechanical or physical effects involve props, pyrotechnics, and other physical methods used during principal photography itself. Some effects involved a combination of techniques; a ray gun might require a pyrotechnic during filming, and then an optical glowing line added to the film image in post-production. Stunts are another important category of physical effects. In general, all kinds of special effects must be carefully planned during pre-production.

===Computer-generated imagery===
&quot;Babylon 5&quot; was the first series to use computer-generated imagery, or &quot;CGI&quot;, for all exterior space scenes, even those with characters in space suits. The technology has made this more practical, so that today models are rarely used. In the 1990s, CGI required expensive processors and customized applications, but by the 2000s (decade), computing power has pushed capabilities down to personal laptops running a wide array of software.

===Models and puppets===
Models have been an essential tool in science fiction television since the beginning, when Buck Rogers took flight in spark-scattering spaceships wheeling across a matte backdrop sky. The original &quot;Star Trek&quot; required a staggering array of models; the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot; had to be built in several different scales for different needs. Models fell out of use in filming in the 1990s as CGI became more affordable and practical, but even today, designers sometimes construct scale models which are then digitized for use in animation software.

Models of characters are puppets. Gerry Anderson created a series of shows using puppets living in a universe of models and miniature sets, notably &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;. &quot;ALF&quot; depicted an alien living in a family, while &quot;Farscape&quot; included two puppets as regular characters. In &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, the Asgard characters are puppets in scenes where they are sitting, standing, or lying down. In &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;, the characters of Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo, two of the show&#x27;s main (and most iconic) characters, are puppets constructed from random household items.

===Animation===

As animation is completely free of the constraints of gravity, momentum, and physical reality, it is an ideal technique for science fiction and fantasy on television. In a sense, virtually all animated series allow characters and objects to perform in unrealistic ways, so they are almost all considered to fit within the broadest category of speculative fiction (in the context of awards, criticism, marketing, etc.) The artistic affinity of animation to comic books has led to a large amount of superhero-themed animation, much of this adapted from comics series, while the impossible characters and settings allowed in animation made this a preferred medium for both fantasy and for series aimed at young audiences.

Originally, animation was all hand-drawn by artists, though in the 1980s, beginning with &quot;Captain Power&quot;, computers began to automate the task of creating repeated images; by the 1990s, hand-drawn animation became defunct.

===Animation in live-action===
In recent years as technology has improved, this has become more common, notably since the development of the Massive software application permits producers to include hordes of non-human characters to storm a city or space station. The robotic Cylons in the new version of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; are usually animated characters, while the Asgard in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; are animated when they are shown walking around or more than one is on screen at once.

==Science fiction television economics and distribution==
In general, science fiction series are subject to the same financial constraints as other television shows. However, high production costs increase the financial risk, while limited audiences further complicate the business case for continuing production. &quot;Star Trek&quot; was the first television series to cost more than $100,000 per episode, while &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; was the first to cost more than $1 million per episode.

==Media fandom==

One of the earliest forms of media fandom was Star Trek fandom. Fans of the series became known to each other through the science fiction fandom. In 1968, NBC decided to cancel &quot;Star Trek&quot;. Bjo Trimble wrote letters to contacts in the National Fantasy Fan Foundation, asking people to organize their local friends to write to the network to demand the show remain on the air. Network executives were overwhelmed by an unprecedented wave of correspondence, and they kept the show on the air. Although the series continued to receive low ratings and was canceled a year later, the enduring popularity of the series resulted in Paramount creating a set of movies, and then a new series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;, which by the early 1990s had become one of the most popular dramas on American television.

&quot;Star Trek&quot; fans continued to grow in number, and first began organizing conventions in the 1970s. No other show attracted a large organized following until the 1990s, when &quot;Babylon 5&quot; attracted both &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans and a large number of literary SF fans who previously had not been involved in media fandom. Other series began to attract a growing number of followers. The British series, &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, has similarly attracted a devoted following.

In the late 1990s, a market for celebrity autographs emerged on eBay, which created a new source of income for actors, who began to charge money for autographs that they had previously been doing for free. This became significant enough that lesser-known actors would come to conventions without requesting any appearance fee, simply to be allowed to sell their own autographs (commonly on publicity photos). Today most events with actor appearances are organized by commercial promoters, though a number of fan-run conventions still exist, such as Toronto Trek and Shore Leave.

The 1985 series &quot;Robotech&quot; is most often credited as the catalyst for the Western interest in anime. The series inspired a few fanzines such as &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; and &quot;Animag&quot; both of which in turn promoted interest in the wide world of anime in general. Anime&#x27;s first notable appearance at SF or comic book conventions was in the form of video showings of popular anime, untranslated and often low quality VHS bootlegs. Starting in the 1990s, anime fans began organizing conventions. These quickly grew to sizes much larger than other science fiction and media conventions in the same communities; many cities now have anime conventions attracting five to ten thousand attendees. Many anime conventions are a hybrid between non-profit and commercial events, with volunteer organizers handling large revenue streams and dealing with commercial suppliers and professional marketing campaigns.

For decades, the majority of science fiction media fandom has been represented by males of all ages and for most of its modern existence, a fairly diverse racial demographic. The most highly publicized demographic for science fiction fans is the male adolescent; roughly the same demographic for American comic books. Female fans, while always present, were far fewer in number and less conspicuously present in fandom. With the rising popularity of fanzines, female fans became increasingly vocal. Starting in the 2000s (decade), genre series began to offer more prominent female characters. Many series featured women as the main characters with males as supporting characters. &quot;True Blood&quot; is an example. Also, such shows premises moved away from heroic action-adventure and focused more on characters and their relationships. This has caused the rising popularity of fanfiction, a large majority of which is categorized as slash fanfiction. Female fans comprise the majority of fanfiction writers.

==Science fiction television history and culture==

===American television science fiction===
American television science fiction has produced &quot;Lost in Space&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone,&quot; and &quot;The X-Files&quot;, among others.

===British television science fiction===
British television science fiction began in 1938 when the broadcast medium was in its infancy with the transmission of a partial adaptation of Karel Čapek&#x27;s play &quot;R.U.R.&quot;. Despite an occasionally chequered history, programmes in the genre have been produced by both the BBC and the largest commercial channel, ITV. 

Nigel Kneale&#x27;s &quot;The Quatermass Experiment&quot; (1953) and its sequels have been called &quot;one of BBC Television&#x27;s earliest audience successes&quot; and Kneale became &quot;one of the most influential television and film writers to emerge in the 1950s&quot;. &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which launched in 1963 and ran until 1989, then was revived in 2005, was listed in the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; in 2006 as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world and as the &quot;most successful&quot; science fiction series of all time. Other cult British series in the science fiction genre include &quot;The Tomorrow People&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;, &quot;Star Cops&quot; and &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.

===Canadian science fiction television===
Science fiction in Canada was produced by the CBC as early as the 1950s. In the 1970s, CTV produced &quot;The Starlost&quot;. In the 1980s, Canadian animation studios including Nelvana, began producing a growing proportion of the world market in animation.

In the 1990s, Canada became an important player in live action speculative fiction on television, with dozens of series like &quot;Forever Knight&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and most notably &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. Many series have been produced for youth and children&#x27;s markets, including &quot;Deepwater Black&quot; and &quot;MythQuest&quot;.

In the first decade of the 21st century, changes in provincial tax legislation prompted many production companies to move from Toronto to Vancouver. Recent popular series produced in Vancouver include &quot;The Dead Zone&quot;, &quot;Smallville&quot;, &quot;Andromeda&quot;, &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;, &quot;The 4400&quot;, &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and the reimagined &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;.

Because of the small size of the domestic television market, most Canadian productions involve partnerships with production studios based in the United States and Europe. However, in recent years, new partnership arrangements are allowing Canadian investors a growing share of control of projects produced in Canada and elsewhere.

===Australian science fiction television===
Australia&#x27;s first locally produced Science Fiction series was &quot;The Stranger&quot; (1964–65) produced and screened by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation . Later series made in the 1960s included &quot;The Interpretaris&quot; (1966) &quot;Vega 4&quot; (1967), and &quot;Phoenix Five&quot; (1970). The country&#x27;s best known Science Fiction series was &quot;Farscape&quot;; an American co-production, it ran from 1999 to 2003. A significant proportion of Australian produced Science Fiction programmes are made for the teens/young Adults market, including &quot;The Girl from Tomorrow&quot;, the long-running &quot;Mr. Squiggle&quot;, &quot;Halfway Across the Galaxy and Turn Left&quot;, &quot;Ocean Girl&quot;, &quot;Crash Zone&quot;, &quot;Watch This Space&quot; and &quot;Spellbinder&quot;.

Other series like &quot;Time Trax&quot;, &quot;Roar&quot;, and &quot;&quot; were filmed in Australia, but used mostly US crew and actors.

===Japanese television science fiction===

Japan has a long history of producing science fiction series for television. Some of the most famous are anime such as Osamu Tezuka&#x27;s &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, the Super Robots such as Mitsuteru Yokoyama&#x27;s &quot;Tetsujin 28-go&quot; (&quot;Gigantor&quot;) and Go Nagai&#x27;s &quot;Mazinger Z&quot;, and the Real Robots such as Yoshiyuki Tomino&#x27;s &quot;Gundam&quot; series and Shōji Kawamori&#x27;s &quot;Macross&quot; series.

Other primary aspects of Japanese science fiction television are the superhero &quot;tokusatsu&quot; (a term literally meaning special effects) series, pioneered by programs such as &quot;Moonlight Mask&quot; and &quot;Planet Prince&quot;. The suitmation technique has been used in long running franchises include Eiji Tsuburaya&#x27;s Ultra Series, Shotaro Ishinomori&#x27;s Kamen Rider Series, and the Super Sentai Series.

In addition, several dramas utilize science fiction elements as framing devices, but are not labeled as &quot;tokusatsu&quot; as they do not utilize actors in full body suits and other special effects.

<text>A skeleton is the structural frame that supports the body of most animals. There are several types of skeletons, including the exoskeleton, which is a rigid outer shell that holds up an organism&#x27;s shape; the endoskeleton, a rigid internal frame to which the organs and soft tissues attach; and the hydroskeleton, a flexible internal structure supported by the hydrostatic pressure of body fluids.

Vertebrates are animals with an endoskeleton centered around an axial vertebral column, and their skeletons are typically composed of bones and cartilages. Invertebrates are other animals that lack a vertebral column, and their skeletons vary, including hard-shelled exoskeleton (arthropods and most molluscs), plated internal shells (e.g. cuttlebones in some cephalopods) or rods (e.g. ossicles in echinoderms), hydrostatically supported body cavities (most), and spicules (sponges). Cartilage is a rigid connective tissue that is found in the skeletal systems of vertebrates and invertebrates.

== Etymology ==
The term &quot;skeleton&quot; comes . &quot;Sceleton&quot; is an archaic form of the word.

==Classification==
Skeletons can be defined by several attributes. Solid skeletons consist of hard substances, such as bone, cartilage, or cuticle. These can be further divided by location; internal skeletons are endoskeletons, and external skeletons are exoskeletons. Skeletons may also be defined by rigidity, where pliant skeletons are more elastic than rigid skeletons. Fluid or hydrostatic skeletons do not have hard structures like solid skeletons, instead functioning via pressurized fluids. Hydrostatic skeletons are always internal.

===Exoskeletons===

An exoskeleton is an external skeleton that covers the body of an animal, serving as armor to protect an animal from predators. Arthropods have exoskeletons that encase their bodies, and have to undergo periodic moulting or ecdysis as the animals grow. The shells of molluscs are another form of exoskeleton. Exoskeletons provide surfaces for the attachment of muscles, and specialized appendanges of the exoskeleton can assist with movement and defense. In arthropods, the exoskeleton also assists with sensory perception.

An external skeleton can be quite heavy in relation to the overall mass of an animal, so on land, organisms that have an exoskeleton are mostly relatively small. Somewhat larger aquatic animals can support an exoskeleton because weight is less of a consideration underwater. The southern giant clam, a species of extremely large saltwater clam in the Pacific Ocean, has a shell that is massive in both size and weight. &quot;Syrinx aruanus&quot; is a species of sea snail with a very large shell.

===Endoskeletons===

Endoskeletons are the internal support structure of an animal, composed of mineralized tissues, such as the bone skeletons found in most vertebrates. Endoskeletons are highly specialized and vary significantly between animals. They vary in complexity from functioning purely for support (as in the case of sponges), to serving as an attachment site for muscles and a mechanism for transmitting muscular forces. A true endoskeleton is derived from mesodermal tissue. Endoskeletons occur in chordates, echinoderms, and sponges.

===Rigidity===

Pliant skeletons are capable of movement; thus, when stress is applied to the skeletal structure, it deforms and then regains its original shape. This skeletal structure is used in some invertebrates, for instance in the hinge of bivalve shells or the mesoglea of cnidarians such as jellyfish. Pliant skeletons are beneficial because only muscle contractions are needed to bend the skeleton; upon muscle relaxation, the skeleton will return to its original shape. Cartilage is one material that a pliant skeleton may be composed of, but most pliant skeletons are formed from a mixture of proteins, polysaccharides, and water. For additional structure or protection, pliant skeletons may be supported by rigid skeletons. Organisms that have pliant skeletons typically live in water, which supports body structure in the absence of a rigid skeleton.

Rigid skeletons are not capable of movement when stressed, creating a strong support system most common in terrestrial animals. Such a skeleton type used by animals that live in water are more for protection (such as barnacle and snail shells) or for fast-moving animals that require additional support of musculature needed for swimming through water. Rigid skeletons are formed from materials including chitin (in arthropods), calcium compounds such as calcium carbonate (in stony corals and mollusks) and silicate (for diatoms and radiolarians).

===Hydrostatic skeletons===

Hydrostatic skeletons are flexible cavities within an animal that provide structure through fluid pressure, occurring in some types of soft-bodied organisms, including jellyfish, flatworms, nematodes, and earthworms. The walls of these cavities are made of muscle and connective tissue. In addition to providing structure for an animal&#x27;s body, hydrostatic skeletons transmit the forces of muscle contraction, allowing an animal to move by alternating contractions and expansions of muscles along the animal&#x27;s length.

===Cytoskeleton===

The cytoskeleton (&quot;cyto-&quot; meaning &#x27;cell&#x27;) is used to stabilize and preserve the form of the cells. It is a dynamic structure that maintains cell shape, protects the cell, enables cellular motion using structures such as flagella, cilia and lamellipodia, and transport within cells such as the movement of vesicles and organelles, and plays a role in cellular division. The cytoskeleton is not a skeleton in the sense that it provides the structural system for the body of an animal; rather, it serves a similar function at the cellular level.

== Vertebrate skeletons ==
Vertebrate skeletons are endoskeletons, and the main skeletal component is bone. Bones compose a unique skeletal system for each type of animal. Another important component is cartilage which in mammals is found mainly in the joint areas. In other animals, such as the cartilaginous fishes, which include the sharks, the skeleton is composed entirely of cartilage. The segmental pattern of the skeleton is present in all vertebrates, with basic units being repeated, such as in the vertebral column and the ribcage.

Bones are rigid organs providing structural support for the body, assistance in movement by opposing muscle contraction, and the forming of a protective wall around internal organs. Bones are primarily made of inorganic minerals, such as hydroxyapatite, while the remainder is made of an organic matrix and water. The hollow tubular structure of bones provide considerable resistance against compression while staying lightweight. Most cells in bones are osteoblasts, osteoclasts, or osteocytes.

Bone tissue is a type of dense connective tissue, a type of mineralized tissue that gives rigidity and a honeycomb-like three-dimensional internal structure. Bones also produce red and white blood cells and serve as calcium and phosphate storage at the cellular level. Other types of tissue found in bones include bone marrow, endosteum and periosteum, nerves, blood vessels and cartilage.

During embryonic development, bones are developed individually from skeletogenic cells in the ectoderm and mesoderm. Most of these cells develop into separate bone, cartilage, and joint cells, and they are then articulated with one another. Specialized skeletal tissues are unique to vertebrates. Cartilage grows more quickly than bone, causing it to be more prominent earlier in an animal&#x27;s life before it is overtaken by bone. Cartilage is also used in vertebrates to resist stress at points of articulation in the skeleton. Cartilage in vertebrates is usually encased in perichondrium tissue. Ligaments are elastic tissues that connect bones to other bones, and tendons are elastic tissues that connect muscles to bones.

=== Amphibians and reptiles ===
The skeletons of turtles have evolved to develop a shell from the ribcage, forming an exoskeleton. The skeletons of snakes and caecilians have significantly more vertebrae than other animals. Snakes often have over 300, compared to the 65 that is typical in lizards.

=== Birds ===
The skeletons of birds are adapted for flight. The bones in bird skeletons are hollow and lightweight to reduce the metabolic cost of flight. Several attributes of the shape and structure of the bones are optimized to endure the physical stress associated with flight, including a round and thin humeral shaft and the fusion of skeletal elements into single ossifications. Because of this, birds usually have a smaller number of bones than other terrestrial vertebrates. Birds also lack teeth or even a true jaw, instead having evolved a beak, which is far more lightweight. The beaks of many baby birds have a projection called an egg tooth, which facilitates their exit from the amniotic egg.

=== Fish ===
The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish is either made of cartilage as in the Chondrichthyes, or bones as in the Osteichthyes. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles. They are supported only by the muscles. The main external features of the fish, the fins, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays which, with the exception of the caudal fin (tail fin), have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk.

Cartilaginous fish, such as sharks, rays, skates, and chimeras, have skeletons made entirely of cartilage. The lighter weight of cartilage allows these fish to expend less energy when swimming.

=== Mammals ===

====Marine mammals====

To facilitate the movement of marine mammals in water, the hind legs were either lost altogether, as in the whales and manatees, or united in a single tail fin as in the pinnipeds (seals). In the whale, the cervical vertebrae are typically fused, an adaptation trading flexibility for stability during swimming.

====Humans====

The skeleton consists of both fused and individual bones supported and supplemented by ligaments, tendons, muscles and cartilage. It serves as a scaffold which supports organs, anchors muscles, and protects organs such as the brain, lungs, heart and spinal cord. The biggest bone in the body is the femur in the upper leg, and the smallest is the stapes bone in the middle ear. In an adult, the skeleton comprises around 13.1% of the total body weight, and half of this weight is water.

Fused bones include those of the pelvis and the cranium. Not all bones are interconnected directly: There are three bones in each middle ear called the ossicles that articulate only with each other. The hyoid bone, which is located in the neck and serves as the point of attachment for the tongue, does not articulate with any other bones in the body, being supported by muscles and ligaments.

There are 206 bones in the adult human skeleton, although this number depends on whether the pelvic bones (the hip bones on each side) are counted as one or three bones on each side (ilium, ischium, and pubis), whether the coccyx or tail bone is counted as one or four separate bones, and does not count the variable wormian bones between skull sutures. Similarly, the sacrum is usually counted as a single bone, rather than five fused vertebrae. There is also a variable number of small sesamoid bones, commonly found in tendons. The patella or kneecap on each side is an example of a larger sesamoid bone. The patellae are counted in the total, as they are constant. The number of bones varies between individuals and with age – newborn babies have over 270 bones some of which fuse together. These bones are organized into a longitudinal axis, the axial skeleton, to which the appendicular skeleton is attached.

The human skeleton takes 20 years before it is fully developed, and the bones contain marrow, which produces blood cells.

There exist several general differences between the male and female skeletons. The male skeleton, for example, is generally larger and heavier than the female skeleton. In the female skeleton, the bones of the skull are generally less angular. The female skeleton also has wider and shorter breastbone and slimmer wrists. There exist significant differences between the male and female pelvis which are related to the female&#x27;s pregnancy and childbirth capabilities. The female pelvis is wider and shallower than the male pelvis. Female pelvises also have an enlarged pelvic outlet and a wider and more circular pelvic inlet. The angle between the pubic bones is known to be sharper in males, which results in a more circular, narrower, and near heart-shaped pelvis.

==Invertebrate skeletons==
Invertebrates are defined by a lack of vertebral column, and they do not have bone skeletons. Arthropods have exoskeletons and echinoderms have endoskeletons. Some soft-bodied organisms, such as jellyfish and earthworms, have hydrostatic skeletons.

=== Arthropods ===
The skeletons of arthropods, including insects, crustaceans, and arachnids, are cuticle exoskeletons. They are composed of chitin secreted by the epidermis. The cuticle covers the animal&#x27;s body and lines several internal organs, including parts of the digestive system. Arthropods molt as they grow through a process of ecdysis, developing a new exoskeleton, digesting part of the previous skeleton, and leaving the remainder behind. An arthropod&#x27;s skeleton serves many functions, working as an integument to provide a barrier and support the body, providing appendages for movement and defense, and assisting in sensory perception. Some arthropods, such as crustaceans, absorb biominerals like calcium carbonate from the environment to strengthen the cuticle.

=== Echinoderms ===
The skeletons of echinoderms, such as starfish and sea urchins, are endoskeletons that consist of large, well-developed sclerite plates that adjoin or overlap to cover the animal&#x27;s body. The skeletons of sea cucumbers are an exception, having a reduced size to assist in feeding and movement. Echinoderm skeletons are composed of stereom, made up of calcite with a monocrystal structure. They also have a significant magnesium content, forming up to 15% of the skeleton&#x27;s composition. The stereome structure is porous, and the pores fill with connective stromal tissue as the animal ages. Sea urchins have as many as ten variants of stereome structure. Among extant animals, such skeletons are unique to echinoderms, though similar skeletons were used by some Paleozoic animals. The skeletons of echinoderms are mesodermal, as they are mostly encased by soft tissue. Plates of the skeleton may be interlocked or connected through muscles and ligaments. Skeletal elements in echinoderms are highly specialized and take many forms, though they usually retain some form of symmetry. The spines of sea urchins are the largest type of echinoderm skeletal structure.

=== Molluscs ===
Some molluscs, such as conchs, scallops, and snails, have shells that serve as exoskeletons. They are produced by proteins and minerals secreted from the animal&#x27;s mantle.

=== Sponges ===
The skeleton of sponges consists of microscopic calcareous or siliceous spicules. The demosponges include 90% of all species of sponges. Their &quot;skeletons&quot; are made of spicules consisting of fibers of the protein spongin, the mineral silica, or both. Where spicules of silica are present, they have a different shape from those in the otherwise similar glass sponges.

==Cartilage==
Cartilage is a connective skeletal tissue composed of specialized cells called chondrocytes that in an extracellular matrix. This matrix is typically composed of Type II collagen fibers, proteoglycans, and water. There are many types of cartilage, including elastic cartilage, hyaline cartilage, fibrocartilage, and lipohyaline cartilage. Unlike other connective tissues, cartilage does not contain blood vessels. The chondrocytes are supplied by diffusion, helped by the pumping action generated by compression of the articular cartilage or flexion of the elastic cartilage. Thus, compared to other connective tissues, cartilage grows and repairs more slowly.

<text>Sarah Michelle Prinze ( ; born April 14, 1977) is an American actress. After being spotted by a talent agent as a young child, she made her film debut at age six in the television film &quot;An Invasion of Privacy&quot; (1983). She had a leading role in the short-lived teen drama series &quot;Swans Crossing&quot; (1992), which was followed by her breakthrough as Kendall Hart on the ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; (1993–1995), for which she won a Daytime Emmy Award.

Gellar achieved international recognition for her portrayal of Buffy Summers on the WB/UPN supernatural series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003), which earned her a Saturn Award, and nominations for a Golden Globe and a TCA Award. Her films have grossed over US$570 million at the worldwide box office, with credits including &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1997), &quot;Scream 2&quot; (1997), &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; (1999), &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; (2002), &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot; (2004), &quot;The Grudge&quot; (2004), &quot;Southland Tales&quot; (2006), &quot;TMNT&quot; (2007), and &quot;Do Revenge&quot; (2022).

In television, Gellar headlined The CW&#x27;s &quot;Ringer&quot; (2011–2012), CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Crazy Ones&quot; (2013–2014), and Paramount+&#x27;s &quot;Wolf Pack&quot; (2023), as well as providing voice work for &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; (2005–2018), &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; (2015–2016), and &quot;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&quot; (2021). In 2015, she co-founded Foodstirs, an e-commerce baking company. She released her own cookbook, &quot;Stirring Up Fun with Food&quot;, in 2017.

==Early life==
Gellar was born in New York City on April 14, 1977. She is the only child of Rosellen (née Greenfield), a nursery school teacher, and Arthur Gellar, a garment worker. Both of her parents are Jewish. In 1984, when she was seven, her parents divorced and she was raised by her mother on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side. While growing up, she lost contact with her father, from whom she remained estranged until his death in 2001. She once described him as &quot;non-existent&quot;, and stated: &quot;My father, you can just say, is not in the picture. I&#x27;m not being deliberately evasive about him, it&#x27;s just that there&#x27;s so little to say.&quot; Gellar was a competitive figure skater, once finishing in third place at a New York State regional competition, as well as having a black belt in taekwondo.

With her single mother working &quot;just above the poverty line&quot;, Gellar received a partial scholarship to study at the Columbia Grammar &amp; Preparatory School, where she experienced bullying. She remarked: &quot;I was different and that&#x27;s the one thing you can&#x27;t be at school, because you&#x27;re ostracised. I didn&#x27;t have the money these kids had&quot;. As a working child actress, she was not present in class for a considerable amount of time, and recalled having &quot;more absences in the first month than you&#x27;re supposed to have for an entire year&quot;. She then briefly attended the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music &amp; Art and Performing Arts, but dropped out due to acting obligations. Gellar graduated from the Professional Children&#x27;s School in 1994 as a &quot;straight A&quot; student with a 4.0 grade average. As she spent significant time working on &quot;All My Children&quot; while &quot;trying to graduate&quot;, the majority of her senior year was completed through guided study.

==Career==
===1980s: Acting beginnings===
At the age of four, Gellar was spotted by an agent in a restaurant in Upper Manhattan. Two weeks later, she auditioned for a part in the television film &quot;An Invasion of Privacy&quot;. At the audition, she read both her own lines and those of Valerie Harper, impressing the directors enough to cast her in the role. The film aired on CBS in January 1983.

While growing up, Gellar appeared in numerous television commercials for such brands as Shake &#x27;n Bake, Avon, and Burger King. A 1982 television spot, in which she claimed Burger King made larger and better tasting burgers than competitor McDonald&#x27;s, was arguably the first attack ad introduced in the fast food industry. Executives at McDonald&#x27;s parent company were so enraged that they sued all parties involved, naming Gellar and reportedly banning her from eating at the food chain. In a 2004 interview, she recalled: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t allowed to eat there. It was tough because, when you&#x27;re a little kid, McDonald&#x27;s is where all your friends have their birthday parties, so I missed out on a lot of apple pies.&quot; She also worked as a model for Wilhelmina.

During the 1980s, Gellar played minor roles in the films &quot;Over the Brooklyn Bridge&quot; (1984), &quot;Crossroads&quot; (1986), and &quot;Funny Farm&quot; (1988), though her scenes in the latter two were cut. She obtained a larger role as the daughter of a prostitute in the B thriller &quot;High Stakes&quot; (1989). Gellar appeared in a safety skit during the November 11, 1985 episode of &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, and guest starred in various television series, such as &quot;&quot; and &quot;Crossbow&quot;. At the age of nine, she acted in the off-Broadway production &quot;The Widow Claire&quot;, as well as in the Kids Klassics Sing Along videos &quot;Camp Melody&quot; and &quot;USS Songboat&quot;. In 1989, she briefly served as a co-host of the syndicated teen talk show &quot;Girl Talk&quot;.

=== 1990s: Mainstream breakthrough and rise to prominence ===
Gellar portrayed 13-year-old Mollie in the initial production of Neil Simon&#x27;s play &quot;Jake&#x27;s Women&quot;, which ran at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego, California, from March to April 1990. In 1991, she was cast as a young Jacqueline Bouvier in &quot;A Woman Named Jackie&quot;. The miniseries won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Limited Series. Gellar obtained her first leading role, as a mayor&#x27;s manipulative daughter, in the 1992 syndicated teen serial &quot;Swans Crossing&quot;, which chronicled the lives of a group of wealthy teenagers. She felt that playing a &quot;villainous&quot; character gave her the call for &quot;better and more varied acting skills&quot;, while the gig&#x27;s weekly payment proved a financial aid for Gellar and her mother. The series ran for a 65-episode season and earned her two Young Artist Award nominations for Best Young Actress.

Gellar made her debut on the ABC soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; in 1993, playing Kendall Hart, the long-lost teenage daughter of character Erica Kane (Susan Lucci). As she got the role, Gellar was complimented as having the acting talent and the &quot;forceful personality&quot; needed to go up against Lucci&#x27;s experience; Kendall was supposed to be like a younger version of Erica. Her stint on the show was successful as &quot;longtime fans of the soap saw her as the second coming of Erica&quot;. Writers showcased her more after her initial reception and she became a household name to the soap opera medium. In 1995, at the age of eighteen, she won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series for the role. The same year, Gellar left the show and moved to Los Angeles to pursue other acting opportunities. She next played a spoiled adolescent in the Walt Disney television film &quot;Beverly Hills Family Robinson&quot;, which aired on ABC in January 1997.

After reading the script for Joss Whedon&#x27;s television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, which follows Buffy Summers, a teenager burdened with the responsibility of fighting occult foes and supernatural occurrences, Gellar screen tested for the role of Cordelia Chase. Whedon then asked her to come back in and audition for the title role. The show premiered in March 1997, to widespread critical and popular acclaim. Gellar&#x27;s Buffy, created to subvert the stereotypical female horror movie victim, was described by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as one of the 100 greatest female characters in American television. &quot;Buffy&quot; ran for seven seasons and 144 episodes, and during its broadcast, earned Gellar five Teen Choice Awards, the Saturn Award for Best Genre Television Actress and a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress – Television Series Drama. She sang during the series&#x27; musical episode &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot;, which spawned an original cast album, released in 2002.

During the early airing of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, Gellar made her first major film appearances in two successful slasher films. In &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1997), she took on the role of ill-fated beauty queen Helen Shivers. &quot;Washington Post&quot; found the cast to be &quot;solid&quot;, in what &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; described as a &quot;competent but uninspired&quot; film. Budgeted at US$17million, the film made US$125million globally. For her part, Gellar earned a Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actress – Horror and a MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Performance. In &quot;Scream 2&quot; (1997), Gellar played a likewise ill-fated vain character, this time that of Sorority sister Cici Cooper. She filmed her scenes in between shots of &quot;Buffy&quot; and had only recently finished work on &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;. Despite the hectic scheduling, she agreed to perform in &quot;Scream 2&quot; without having read the script, on the basis of the success of the first film. &quot;Scream 2&quot; grossed over US$172million worldwide.

In January 1998, Gellar hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for the first time. She returned as a host in May 1999 and October 2002, and made two cameo appearances in May 2000, including one in which she introduced Britney Spears&#x27; performance of &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Me Be the Last to Know&quot;. In 1998, she also provided her voice for the Gwendy Doll in &quot;Small Soldiers&quot;, and for the character of Marie in the &quot;King of the Hill&quot; episode &quot;And They Call It Bobby Love&quot;. Gellar&#x27;s cameo as a girl sitting in the high school cafeteria in the sleeper hit &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; (1999) was soon followed by her first top-billing film role, as a struggling restaurant owner, in the romantic comedy &quot;Simply Irresistible&quot; (1999). The film received negative reviews and flopped at the box office, but Roger Ebert found her to be &quot;lovely&quot; in what he described as an &quot;old-fashioned&quot; comedy.

In Roger Kumble&#x27;s &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; (1999), a modern-day retelling of &quot;Les Liaisons dangereuses&quot;, Gellar portrayed Kathryn Merteuil, a cocaine addict with an appetite for manipulating people. In his review for the film, Ebert felt that she is &quot;effective as a bright girl who knows exactly how to use her act as a tramp&quot;, and in an interview with &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, Kumble described her as &quot;the most professional actor I ever worked with&quot;. The film was a hit at the box office, grossing US$75million worldwide, and went on to become a cult classic. Gellar and co-star Selma Blair obtained the Best Kiss award at the 2000 MTV Movie Awards. In &quot;Angel&quot;, a spin-off series of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, Gellar reprised her titular role for a three-episode arc, starting in 1999.

=== 2000s: Film success and established actress ===
In 2000, Gellar appeared as a film studio executive in the HBO series &quot;Sex and the City&quot; episode &quot;Escape from New York&quot;. Her next film, James Toback&#x27;s independent drama &quot;Harvard Man&quot; (2001), in which she starred as the &quot;sharp and shrewd&quot; daughter of a mobster, helped her shed her good girl image, along with &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;, according to Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 2002, Gellar portrayed Daphne Blake in the live action–comedy &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot;. For the production, she trained with a Hong Kong wire team, and commuted between Queensland and California every two weeks due to her simultaneous commitment to &quot;Buffy&quot;. Despite negative reviews, A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that her performance added &quot;a snarl of &quot;Powerpuff&quot; feminism to her character&#x27;s ditzy stereotype&quot;, and with a global gross of US$275million, &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; emerged as Gellar&#x27;s most widely seen film to date. Her role earned her the Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress – Comedy. With Jack Black, she hosted the 2002 MTV Movie Awards, which attracted 7.1million viewers on its June 6 broadcast, achieving the show&#x27;s highest rating ever at the time.

During her growing film career, Gellar continued to work on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, but she decided to leave the series after the seventh season. When asked why, she explained, &quot;This isn&#x27;t about leaving for a career in movies, or in theater –it&#x27;s more of a personal decision. I need a rest.&quot; In her feature in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, Gellar expressed her pride for her work on &quot;Buffy&quot;, &quot;I truly believe that it is one of the greatest shows of all time and it will go down in history as that. And I don&#x27;t feel that that is a cocky statement. We changed the way that people looked at television.&quot;
After the end of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, Gellar reprised the role of Daphne in &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot; (2004). Like the first film, &quot;Scooby-Doo 2&quot; was a commercial success despite a negative critical response. In Takashi Shimizu&#x27;s &quot;The Grudge&quot; (2004), she portrayed Karen Davis, an exchange student in Tokyo who becomes exposed to a supernatural curse. The film received mixed reviews from critics, but was a major box office hit, grossing more than US$110million in North America and US$187million globally. She received a MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Frightened Performance as well as a Teen Choice Award nomination for Choice Movie Actress – Thriller. Gellar provided her voice for the character Gina Vendetti in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Wandering Juvie&quot;, which aired in March 2004, and went on to voice several recurring characters of the animated television series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, starting in 2005. Gellar starred in Richard Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Southland Tales&quot; (2006) as a psychic adult film star who creates a reality television series based on prophetic visions. Drawn to the &quot;batshit ambitious&quot; ideas for the film, she accepted the role before she even read the script. &quot;Southland Tales&quot; polarised critics upon its debut at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and found a limited audience in theaters. However, J. Hoberman for &quot;Village Voice&quot; remarked that the director contrived a &quot;memorable&quot; comic performance from Gellar, while the film gathered a cult following in subsequent years. In 2006, Gellar briefly reprised the role of Karen in the sequel &quot;The Grudge 2&quot;, and starred in Asif Kapadia&#x27;s psychological thriller &quot;The Return&quot;, as a businesswoman haunted by memories of her childhood and the mysterious death of a young woman. &quot;The Return&quot; was a critical and commercial failure, grossing only US$11million. Jeannette Catsoulis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;career stagnation&quot;.

In 2007, Gellar voiced Ella and April O&#x27;Neil in &quot;Happily N&#x27;Ever After&quot; and &quot;TMNT&quot;, respectively. She starred in the romantic comedy &quot;Suburban Girl&quot; and the drama &quot;The Air I Breathe&quot;, both of which were screened at the 2007 Tribeca Film Festival and released in January 2008. In &quot;Suburban Girl&quot;, she took on the role of a New York City editor and the love interest of a much older businessman (Alec Baldwin). In &quot;The Air I Breathe&quot;, Gellar portrayed an up-and-coming pop singer. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the latter as a &quot;gangster movie with delusions of grandeur&quot;, while &quot;DVD Talk&quot; noted that &quot;her character here has the deepest emotional arc, and she hits all the right notes.&quot;

===2010s: Continued work and breaks===
The psychological thriller &quot;Possession&quot;, in which Gellar starred as a lawyer whose life is thrown into chaos after a car accident sends her husband and brother-in-law into comas, had a range of release dates in the United States between 2008 and 2009, due to financial problems at Yari Film Group. The film ultimately went to DVD in March 2010. 

Gellar took a two-year hiatus from acting following the birth of her daughter in 2009, and in 2011, she signed to star and work as executive producer for The CW&#x27;s &quot;Ringer&quot;, in which she played the dual role of twin sisters, one of whom is on the run and manages to hide by assuming the wealthy life of the other. Gellar has stated that part of her decision to return to television was because it allowed her to both work and raise her family. Despite a large fan base, the series received mixed reviews, and was canceled after the first season. For her portrayal, she received several award nominations, including one for the Teen Choice Award for Choice Television Actress – Drama.

In September 2011, Gellar returned as a guest star on &quot;All My Children&quot; before the show&#x27;s ending but not as Kendall Hart; she portrayed a patient at Pine Valley Hospital who tells Maria Santos that she is &quot;Erica Kane&#x27;s daughter&quot;, and states that she saw vampires before they became trendy—a reference to &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. She voiced different characters in the &quot;American Dad!&quot; episodes &quot;Virtual In-Stanity&quot; and &quot;Adventures in Hayleysitting&quot;, which aired in November 2011 and December 2012, respectively. On September 30, 2012, she reprised her role of Gina Vendetti in the premiere episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; season 24.

A fan of Robin Williams for years, once Gellar learned that he was making the CBS single-camera sitcom &quot;The Crazy Ones&quot; (2013–2014), she contacted her friend Sarah de Sa Rego, the wife of Williams&#x27; best friend, Bobcat Goldthwait, in order to lobby for a co-starring role. She obtained the part of an advertising director who runs an agency with her father. &quot;Digital Spy&quot; felt that Williams &quot;shares a warm, genuine chemistry with his on-screen offspring Gellar,&quot; as part of a mixed critical response. The series was canceled after one season, but earned Gellar the People&#x27;s Choice Award for Favorite Actress in a New Television Series.

In &quot;Veronika Decides to Die&quot;, Gellar starred as a young depressed woman who rediscovers the joy in life when she finds out that she only has days to live following a suicide attempt. Following theatrical runs abroad, the film was released domestically through VOD in January 2015. Frank Scheck of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; found the actress to be &quot;reasonably compelling&quot; in what he called a &quot;ponderous and silly misfire&quot;.

Following the conclusion of &quot;The Crazy Ones&quot; and the death of Williams, Gellar took another sabbatical from screen acting, stating that she had &quot;been working [her] entire life&quot; and &quot;needed that break&quot; to focus on raising her children. During that period, she made an appearance as Cinderella in a March 2015 episode of Whitney Avalon&#x27;s YouTube channel series &quot;Princess Rap Battle&quot;, voiced a recurring character known as the Seventh Sister in the second season of the animated science fiction series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; (2015–2016), and guest starred as herself in the series finale of &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, which aired on May 16, 2019. Gellar was also attached to several television projects that ultimately were not picked up for production. These included a 2016 pilot for a series based on &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot;, in which she reprised her role of Kathryn Merteuil.

===2020s: Film comeback and television focus===
In 2021, Gellar voiced Teela in Kevin Smith&#x27;s &quot;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&quot;, an animated series for Netflix. In 2022, she made her first film appearances in 13 years with brief roles in &quot;Clerks III&quot; and &quot;Do Revenge&quot;, released in theaters and on Netflix respectively, in the same week. Mark Donaldson of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; described them as &quot;low-key return movies&quot; for Gellar, noting &quot;Clerks 3&quot; as &quot;a nod&quot; to having previously worked with Smith, and &quot;Do Revenge&quot; as a reassessment of &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; for &quot;modern audiences&quot;. At the 2022 San Diego Comic-Con, it was announced that Gellar would star in and act as an executive producer of the Paramount+ supernatural drama series &quot;Wolf Pack&quot;, which premiered on January 26, 2023. In June 2024, Gellar was cast in a recurring role as Tanya Martin, the CSI chief and Dexter Morgan&#x27;s boss in the upcoming drama series &quot;&quot;.

==Other ventures==
===Activism and philanthropy===
Gellar has been an active advocate for various charities, including breast cancer research, Project Angel Food, Habitat for Humanity and CARE. Of her charitable pursuits, she said: &quot;I started because my mother taught me a long time ago that even when you have nothing, there&#x27;s ways to give back. And what you get in return for that is tenfold. But it was always hard because I couldn&#x27;t do a lot. I couldn&#x27;t do much more than just donate money when I was on [&quot;Buffy&quot;] because there wasn&#x27;t time. And now that I have the time, it&#x27;s amazing.&quot;

In 1999, Gellar helped Habitat for Humanity&#x27;s project of building homes in Dominican Republic. With Project Angel Food, she delivered healthy meals to people infected with AIDS, and through the Make-A-Wish Foundation, she granted sick children&#x27;s wishes of meeting her while working on &quot;Buffy&quot;. In 2007, Gellar was featured in Vaseline&#x27;s &quot;Skin Is Amazing&quot; campaign, in which she agreed to auction nude-posed photos of herself on eBay to raise money for the Coalition of Skin Diseases, an organization which supports clinical research, fosters physician and patient education.

In 2011, Gellar joined &quot;The Nestlé Share the Joy of Reading Program&quot;, which promotes reading to young children to encourage them to read during the summer break. The following year, she was presented with the Tom Mankiewicz Leadership Award during the Beastly Ball at the Los Angeles Zoo. In 2014 and 2015, Gellar hosted two fundraisers for Mattel Children&#x27;s Hospital UCLA.

===Business and media===
Gellar has graced the covers of numerous magazines throughout her career. After her February 1998 appearance on &quot;Seventeen&quot;, the list went on to include &quot;Nylon&quot;, &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Allure&quot;, &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, &quot;FHM&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;Elle&quot;, among others. She was featured on the cover of &quot;Gotham&quot; and their main story in the March 2008 issue, in which she spoke about how her style has evolved since she passed 30. She said: &quot;It sounds clichéd, but when women turn 30, they find themselves. You become more comfortable in your own skin. Last night on &quot;Letterman&quot;, I wore this skintight Herve Leger dress. Two years ago, three years ago? I would never have worn it.&quot; She has appeared in &quot;Got Milk?&quot; ads as well as in the Stone Temple Pilots music video &quot;Sour Girl&quot; and Marcy Playground&#x27;s &quot;Comin&#x27; Up From Behind&quot;.

In October 2015, Gellar, along with entrepreneurs Galit Laibow and Greg Fleishman, co-founded Foodstirs, a startup food crafting brand selling via e-commerce and retail easy-to-make organic baking mixes and kits for families. By 2018, the brand&#x27;s products were sold at 7,500 retailers nationwide, including Starbucks, Whole Foods, Walmart, WW and Amazon.

Gellar released a cookbook titled &quot;Stirring up Fun with Food&quot; on April 18, 2017. The book was co-authored by Gia Russo, and features numerous food crafting ideas.

==Artistry and reception==

Known for often playing characters with &quot;strength, sensitivity and snark&quot; in the horror genre, Gellar has been viewed as a &quot;scream queen&quot; throughout the majority of her career. She has stated that horror offers actresses &quot;the best roles&quot; through which they &quot;can really shine&quot;, and that it is in television where &quot;women are the stars, but in films we&#x27;re still struggling to play the leads&quot;. Thus, she feels that she &quot;couldn&#x27;t just be the girlfriend or the wife in a film&quot;. She has said: &quot;So I&#x27;ll be wherever the good female roles are. I like horror.&quot; Writing for &quot;Bloody Disgusting&quot;, Alex DiVincenzo asserted that &quot;&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; alone should be enough to cement her horror icon status&quot;, and highlighting some of her roles in the genre, observed: &quot;Regardless of whether they made it to the end credits, her characters were intelligent, resourceful, and empowering.&quot; She has ranked 6th among &quot;The All Time Greatest Horror Scream Queens&quot; by &quot;CinemaBlend&quot;, 4th among the &quot;9 Greatest Scream Queens in All of Horror&quot; by &quot;Syfy&quot;, and 8th among the &quot;10 Best Scream Queens of the &#x27;90s&quot; by &quot;Screen Rant&quot;.

By the late 1990s, Gellar had become a household name, as well as one of Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;It Girls&quot;. In 1998, she appeared on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Top 12 Entertainers of the Year and the &quot;Most Beautiful&quot; list by &quot;People&quot; magazine. In 1999, she signed on to be the face of Maybelline —becoming the company&#x27;s first celebrity spokeswoman since Lynda Carter in the late 1970s— and was voted number one in &quot;FHM&quot;″s &quot;100 Sexiest Women&quot; of the year. She was featured in the magazine&#x27;s German, Dutch, South African, Danish and Romanian editions of the list since 1998. Topsocialite.com listed her as the 8th Sexiest woman of the 1990s.

In 2002, Gellar was honored with a Woman of the Year Award by &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine, and her wax figure by Madame Tussauds, was unveiled as part of the &quot;Trail of Vampires&quot; exhibition. Between 2002 and 2008, she was featured on the annual &quot;Maxim&quot; &quot;Hot 100&quot; list. Wearing a black lace bra, she was on the cover of the December 2007 issue of &quot;Maxim&quot; and was named the 2009 Woman of the Year by the magazine. She was also featured in Google&#x27;s Top 10 Women Searches of 2002 and 2003, coming in at No. 8, and was included in UK Channel 4&#x27;s 100 Greatest Sex Symbols in 2007, ranking at No. 16. Other appearances and listings include &quot;Glamour&quot;″s 50 Best Dressed Women in the World in 2004 and 2005, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Top 100 TV Icons in 2007, and BuddyTV&#x27;s 100 Sexiest Women of 2011.

==Personal life==

Gellar met her future husband, Freddie Prinze Jr., while they were filming the 1997 teen horror film &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, but the two did not begin dating until 2000. She and Prinze have worked together several times, including when they played each other&#x27;s respective love interests as Fred and Daphne in &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; and &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot;. They were engaged in April 2001 and married in Mexico on September 1, 2002, in a ceremony officiated by Adam Shankman, a director and choreographer with whom Gellar had worked on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. In 2007, in honor of their fifth year of marriage, Gellar legally changed her name to Sarah Michelle Prinze. Together, she and Prinze have two children, a daughter born in 2009 and a son born in 2012. The family lives in Los Angeles.

On February 10, 2021, Gellar expressed support for her &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; co-star Charisma Carpenter after Carpenter made allegations of abuse against series creator Joss Whedon. She also stated, &quot;While I am proud to have my name associated with Buffy Summers, I don&#x27;t want to be forever associated with the name Joss Whedon.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; published January 18, 2023, Gellar is quoted as saying, &quot;I&#x27;ll never tell my full story because I don&#x27;t get anything out of it.&quot;

<text>The sonic screwdriver is a fictional multifunctional tool in the British science fiction television programme &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and its spin-offs, used by the Doctor. Like the TARDIS, it has become one of the icons of the programme, and spin-off media such as &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot; and &quot;Torchwood&quot; have replicated its functions in devices such as the sonic lipstick, sonic blaster, sonic probe, sonic modulator and sonic cane.

The sonic screwdriver was introduced in 1968 in the story &quot;Fury from the Deep&quot;, and used twice more (&quot;The Dominators&quot; and &quot;The War Games&quot;) during the Second Doctor&#x27;s tenure. It became a popular tool for the Third Doctor and Fourth Doctor. It was written out of the series in 1982 due to the limitations it caused when writing for the show. It then featured briefly in the 1996 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television movie, before making a full return in the 2005 continuation of the series.

Throughout the programme, there have been many different versions of the sonic screwdriver, as with subsequent Doctors the design of it was changed. It has also been destroyed on a number of occasions, thus leading to the introduction of the next model. Not all iterations of the Doctor have used the sonic screwdriver on screen; the Fifth Doctor in fact opted not to replace his after it was destroyed in &quot;The Visitation&quot;.

The Twelfth Doctor loses his sonic screwdriver to the creator of the Daleks, Davros, after lending it to him when he was a child. In the last episode of Series 9, the Doctor received a new sonic screwdriver from the TARDIS in place of the sonic sunglasses he had been using temporarily in the meantime.

Despite the Doctor&#x27;s claim not to entrust his screwdriver to anyone, he lends one to his own doppelgänger in &quot;The Rebel Flesh,&quot; and again supplies Rory Williams for its third job in his care in &quot;The Girl Who Waited,&quot; after having given or loaning Rory one in &quot;A Good Man Goes to War&quot; and slipping him one in &quot;The Big Bang&quot;. He also gifts one to River Song in &quot;The Husbands of River Song,&quot; which is then used by the Tenth Doctor to &quot;save&quot; her life in a previous TV story, &quot;Forest of the Dead.&quot;

== Functions ==

The functions of a sonic screwdriver are based on its power over sound waves, radiation, wavelengths, frequencies, signals, and electromagnetism. It is shown to hack, disable, activate, and otherwise control technology from almost everything, allowing it to remotely control almost any machinery, mechanisms, and computers it is applied to, allowing it to open locks, detonate explosives, remotely activate electronics, override most systems, activate computers, and cause some energy weapons to burst into flames or sparks. There is technology the sonic is unable to interface with, such as wood, or the isomorphic controls seen in &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;. It also is capable of causing chemical reactions that allow the Doctor to turn eyeglass lenses black like sunglasses and causing cut barbed wire to regenerate (setting 2428B). It is also capable of detecting, amplifying and controlling certain energies, sound, signals, frequencies, and waves, allowing the Doctor to intercept a teleporting individual and send them where he chooses, scan and identify matter, send out communications, enhance sounds, signals, and frequencies, and acting as a catalyst or conduit for energies. Sonics are also capable of calculations, such as &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013), when the War Doctor used calculations to allow the sonic to work on wood, the calculations of which appeared partly done on the Tenth Doctor&#x27;s sonic and completed in the Eleventh&#x27;s. The War Doctor also used his sonic in tandem with the Tenth and Eleventh&#x27;s to create a force field wave to repel a Dalek.

These are more specific functions of the sonic screwdriver:
* Unlocking or locking a door
* Burning or cutting certain substances
* Remotely detonating specific machines or explosives
* Amplifying sound waves and the power of an X-ray machine beyond its normal capacities
* Disarming weapons and electronics
* Flashlight
* Intercepting and conducting teleportation
* Hacking an ATM
* Regenerating barbed wire on a fence
* Darkening eyeglass lenses to transform them into sunglasses
* Microphone (when connected to an audio amplifier)
* Detecting and interpreting signals
* Conducting medical scans
* Fixing
* Locking the coordinates of the TARDIS
* Tracking alien life
* Using red setting or dampers
* Controlling the properties of atoms and molecules on a small scale
* Operating computers, whether their origin is alien or human
* Providing geolocation
* Lighting candles
* Creating a force field wave with two (or possibly more) other sonics to physically repel a Dalek (it may have to be the same sonic device at different points in its own time stream)
* Modifying a mobile phone
* Disclosing and deactivating camouflage
* Disarming robotics
* Scanning and classifying matter
* Shattering glass
* Creating an &quot;acoustic corridor&quot; for speaking with someone far away
* Shocking neural centers of living organisms
* Downloading a person&#x27;s consciousness and transferring it into a computer hard drive (only seen in a special model created by The Doctor as a gift to River Song)
* Triggering particular protocols of the TARDIS
* Tightening and loosening screws
* Resonating concrete
* Creating glass-like walls (&quot;Force Field&quot;)
* Creating holographic screens
* Reconstructing the TARDIS 
* Hijacking traffic lights
* Creating a field that silences all noise

Aside from being a tool, the sonic screwdriver can be used and considered as a defensive weapon, which is effective for a few types of assault weapons, but not designed to kill or injure living things as the only way it can really hurt or incapacitate an organism is by emitting painful bursts of sound, or, as of &quot;Day of the Moon&quot; (2011) by blasting a green wave of energy to incapacitate a target, though only the Eleventh and Twelfth&#x27;s sonic has been shown to do the latter.

== History ==
=== 1968–1982 and 1996 ===

The sonic screwdriver made its first appearance in the serial &quot;Fury from the Deep&quot; (1968), written by Victor Pemberton. It was used thereafter by the Second Doctor as a multi-purpose tool, with occasional variations in appearance over the course of the series.

Its abilities and overall appearance varied greatly during the classic series. The name implies that it operates through the use of sound waves to exert physical forces on objects remotely. During the Second Doctor&#x27;s tenure, it functioned much as its name implied—using sonic waves to dismantle equipment or to bypass locks. In addition, it was used as a welding torch in Episode Five of &quot;The Dominators&quot; (1968). In the audio commentary for &quot;The Sea Devils&quot; (1972), Michael Briant claims to have suggested it as a one-off gadget in 1968.

During the Third Doctor&#x27;s tenure, producer Barry Letts was adamant that the device should not become a cure-all for the series and limited its use to avoid writers becoming over-reliant on it. During this time, the device underwent significant design changes. In &quot;The Sea Devils&quot;, the Doctor used it to detonate landmines; Michael E. Briant explains that this was feasible, stating that the sonic waves shook the mines. In &quot;The Three Doctors&quot; (1972–73), the sonic screwdriver is almost unrecognisable, being a unique, one-use prop with a plastic red spherical head. In the DVD commentary, Letts himself remarks on the thickness of the prop and the fact that it belies the idea that it was the regular one, prompting Katy Manning to question whether it was indeed a sonic screwdriver. This was due to the serial being produced out of transmission order: the original sonic screwdriver prop went missing during the recording of &quot;Carnival of Monsters&quot; (1973), requiring a new prop to be built for the rest of the season; &quot;The Three Doctors&quot; was recorded after &quot;Carnival&quot;, but set before it, so the screwdriver could be seen to revert to its previous appearance for one story after &quot;The Three Doctors&quot; before receiving a more permanent redesign thereafter.

During the first three years of the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s tenure, producer Philip Hinchcliffe further reduced the use of the sonic screwdriver. Exceptions include &quot;Robot&quot; (which was the last story to be produced by Barry Letts), where it was again used to detonate mines, and as a &quot;miniature sonic lance&quot; to cut out a lock. Aside from unlocking doors, the device was greatly downplayed during the Fourth Doctor&#x27;s second and third seasons. It saw a resurgence once Graham Williams took over as producer in 1977. In the final story of season 15, &quot;The Invasion of Time&quot;, the Fourth Doctor conceded, &quot;Not even the sonic screwdriver can get me out of this one.&quot;

It featured regularly in season 16 during the Key to Time saga. The Doctor&#x27;s Time Lady companion Romana constructed a sonic screwdriver of her own similar to the Doctor&#x27;s. It is depicted as being smaller and sleeker than the Doctor&#x27;s, and he was sufficiently impressed with her design that he attempted to swap screwdrivers with her in &quot;The Horns of Nimon&quot; (1979–80). By season 18, both script editor Christopher H Bidmead and producer John Nathan-Turner were eager to downplay the device as much as possible.

The sonic screwdriver was written out of the series late in season 19, in the Fifth Doctor serial &quot;The Visitation&quot; (1982). It is destroyed by a Terileptil to prevent the Doctor from escaping a holding cell; in response, the Doctor sorrowfully remarked, &quot;I feel as if you&#x27;ve just killed an old friend.&quot; Eric Saward later explained in a 2005 DVD interview that this was done on the instructions of producer John Nathan-Turner. Saward had written out the sonic screwdriver, believing that the Doctor had &quot;a cupboard full of them&quot; in the TARDIS. On the basis that a device that could help in any situation was very limiting for the script, Nathan-Turner decided that it would not return. The Tenth Doctor joked about the Fifth Doctor&#x27;s lack of sonic screwdriver in the mini-episode &quot;Time Crash&quot; (2007), commenting that he &quot;went hands-free&quot; and could &quot;save the universe using a kettle and some string.&quot; The device did not appear again for the remainder of the original series.

In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV Movie (1996) and &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot; (2013), the Seventh (TVM), Eighth (both), &amp; the War Doctor (&quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot;) were seen to have a new sonic screwdriver with a telescopic mechanism: similar to its predecessors but with subtle differences such as a gold/brass band on the handle, a flat base and a red emitter tip.

=== 2005–2010 ===

A redesigned sonic screwdriver appears in the new series, with a blue light in addition to the sound effect. In its first incarnation, the prop used in the new series was fragile and prone to breakage. Over the course of the next two years, the props were continually repaired and modified, with some additions being a new thumb slider design and different colours of wires used in the clear channel when extended.

For series 4 (2008), a new design of Screwdriver was commissioned by the BBC. Nick Robatto was hired to make two new props. These featured the final slider design, and redesigned body ridges, among other smaller changes. This design debuted in 2008&#x27;s &quot;Partners in Crime&quot; and continued to be used until the Screwdriver&#x27;s ultimate destruction in 2010&#x27;s &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;. This later design has gained the nickname &quot;Series 3–4 Sonic&quot; (relating to the fact that at the start of Series 3, in &quot;Smith and Jones&quot;, the first Sonic Screwdriver was supposedly destroyed), even though strictly speaking it first appeared in Series 4.

In contrast with Nathan-Turner&#x27;s attitude that the sonic screwdriver should not be used as a cure-all, the new production team gave it even more functionality than previous versions. Some of the uses in the new series include: repairing electronic equipment; re-attaching materials such as barbed wire; detecting, intercepting and sending signals; remotely operating the TARDIS; burning, cutting, or igniting substances; fusing metal; scanning and identifying substances; amplifying or augmenting sound; modifying mobile phones to enable &quot;universal roaming&quot;; disabling alien disguises; resonating concrete; reversing teleportation of another entity. It is sometimes used to disassemble robotic enemies or turn other objects into weapons; healing cuts and wounds. In &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot; (2005) and &quot;Utopia&quot; (2007), it is used to operate the TARDIS controls remotely; when the Doctor attempts to counteract the Master&#x27;s theft of the TARDIS, it is used to limit the TARDIS&#x27; destination. In &quot;Doomsday&quot; (2006), the Doctor states that the sonic screwdriver does not kill, wound or maim; however, it is sometimes brandished in a threatening manner, such as in &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; (2005), &quot;The Impossible Planet&quot; (2006), &quot;The Runaway Bride&quot; (2006), &quot;The Lazarus Experiment&quot; (2007), &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013), and &quot;The Infinite Quest&quot; (2007). In &quot;World War Three&quot; (2005), when confronted by a group of Slitheen, the Doctor threatens to &quot;triplicate the flammability&quot; of a bottle of port wine with the sonic screwdriver, though one of the Slitheen realises he is bluffing. In &quot;Closing Time&quot; (2011), ringed energy beams are seen emitted from the device, giving it a more weapon-like appearance, particularly when used to disable a weakened Cyberman at a distance.

In &quot;Smith and Jones&quot;, the sonic screwdriver burns out after the Doctor uses it to amplify the radiation output of a hospital X-ray machine. In the &quot;Series Three concept Artwork Gallery&quot;, when referring to the burnt out sonic screwdriver, Peter McKinstry says &quot;the green crystal structure visible under the shattered dome refers back to the TARDIS console crystal. It&#x27;s the same technology – the TARDIS&#x27;s little brother.&quot; Though initially saddened at the loss of the screwdriver, the Doctor obtains a new one at the conclusion of the episode.

The sonic screwdriver is unable to open a &quot;deadlock seal&quot;, used as a plot device to prevent an easy solution. Russell T Davies once mentioned that he would never make the sonic screwdriver the solution to an episode. In &quot;Silence in the Library&quot; (2008), while trying to open a wooden door, the Doctor tells Donna that the sonic screwdriver will not work because the door is made of wood, a fact later restated in &quot;The Hungry Earth&quot; (2010); when Rory complains about this, the Doctor counters to not &quot;diss the sonic.&quot; The sonic screwdriver&#x27;s inability to work on wood is clarified in &quot;In the Forest of the Night&quot; (2014), when the Doctor states that the sonic screwdriver works by manipulating the moving parts in various machinery: since plant tissue lacks said moving parts, it is unaffected by the sonic screwdriver. In &quot;The Parting of the Ways&quot; (2005), the Doctor mentions that when Emergency Program One was activated, the sonic screwdriver would receive a signal from the TARDIS. In &quot;Forest of the Dead&quot; (2008), he claims that a few hair-dryers can interfere with the device, though he states that he is &quot;working on that&quot;.

=== 2010–2015 ===
In &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; (2010), the malfunctioning sonic screwdriver is destroyed when the Doctor tries to signal the Atraxi ships. The Doctor later receives a new one, which emerges from the newly regenerated TARDIS console. The Eleventh Doctor&#x27;s sonic screwdriver is larger than its predecessor; it has a green light and metal claws that extend with a flick of the wrist. It is shown to have been created by the TARDIS as part of its automatic regeneration.

In &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (2010), the Doctor advises a young Kazran Sardick to pursue romance while implying that in a similar situation in his own past he had instead gone to his room to &quot;design a new kind of screwdriver.&quot;
Also in that episode, the sonic screwdriver gets split into two pieces, one of which ends up inside a flying shark. The remaining piece is said to be signalling its other half in an effort to repair itself. The Doctor uses this to send a signal through the half inside the sky shark to open up the clouds. Afterwards, the half not in the shark is left with Kazran Sardick. The Doctor tells Kazran that he can call him for help using the Sonic; though Kazran declines to do so. The Doctor had duplicates of this screwdriver, which he continued to use throughout his travels.

In &quot;Let&#x27;s Kill Hitler&quot; (2011), it is explained that instead of having settings, this version operates through a psychic interface, basically doing whatever the user thinks of while pointing and holding down the button. This version of the screwdriver also appears, although never officially announced, to have a flashlight setting, as the Doctor is seen to have it emitting a continuous glow while not uttering the classic sonic noise. Also in the episode, the Doctor uses another modified version of his sonic, which he calls a &quot;Sonic Cane&quot;. It is similar to a Tuxedo cane, except the top replaced with the upper portion of his screwdriver, with a metal ball cut in fourths attached to the claws.

Ahead of the 50th anniversary special, a mini-episode entitled &quot;The Night of the Doctor&quot; (2013) was produced in which the Eighth Doctor uses the sonic screwdriver twice. The Doctor uses his telescopic screwdriver previously seen in the TV movie, rather than his updated steampunk version which had been used in numerous Big Finish audio dramas.

For the 50th anniversary special, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot; (2013), another version was seen in the hands of John Hurt&#x27;s War Doctor. The design was similar to the one used by Tom Baker&#x27;s Fourth Doctor. This time the halo and bullet tip had been removed, replaced by a red light as well as a large red dial added to the base. Character Options released a version of this sonic screwdriver on 23 November 2013 at London&#x27;s ExCel labelling it &quot;The Other Doctor&#x27;s Sonic&quot;. It was established as a plot point in that episode that the sonic screwdrivers employed by various Doctor incarnations all use the same software, something the War Doctor exploited by running a calculation over a course of several centuries with the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors seeing the calculation completed through their models. It is also directly implied after the fact that the sonic screwdriver has actually been a part of every doctor&#x27;s retinue, despite its disappearance for doctors six &amp; seven; the Tenth Doctor says to the Gallifreyan high command, as all thirteen doctors are about to change history by saving the planet, that the calculations for doing what&#x27;s about to be done have been &quot;running all my lives.&quot; In addition, when combined, the screwdrivers of the War, Tenth, and Eleventh Doctor could create a sonic force field blast to repel and destroy a Dalek.

&quot;The Magician&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; (2015) shows that the sonic screwdriver can create &quot;an acoustic corridor&quot; so that the Twelfth Doctor can communicate with a boy trapped in an extraterrestrial mine field. However, when the Doctor discovers that the boy is actually a young Davros, he abandons the boy, leaving the screwdriver behind, though it is revealed that he did save young Davros after all. Davros is shown to have kept the screwdriver in his possession ever since, and the Doctor tells Clara that he no longer has a screwdriver. By that time, the screwdriver had been withered and damaged by time and was seemingly useless.

==== Sonic sunglasses ====
In his first appearance at the beginning of series nine of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, the Doctor is seen wearing black Ray-Ban sunglasses (&quot;The Magician&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;), and he says that he no longer has his sonic screwdriver. Later, in &quot;The Witch&#x27;s Familiar&quot;, he unveils that the sunglasses are actually a wearable version of the screwdriver, claiming that he is &quot;over&quot; screwdrivers: &quot;They spoil the line of your jacket.&quot; The glasses are used by the Doctor, and Clara on occasion, throughout the ninth series.

The sonic sunglasses appears to have the same basic functions as the traditional sonic screwdriver, such as scanning objects, while having features not seen before:

* Allowing the Doctor to hear people talking, even if they are several yards away and surrounded by loud noises (&quot;The Magician&#x27;s Apprentice&quot;).
* Reassembling the TARDIS after it has used its Hostile Action Dispersal System to avoid destruction by the Daleks (&quot;The Witch&#x27;s Familiar&quot;).
* Creating and controlling a sophisticated hologram of the Doctor through a WiFi system (&quot;Before the Flood&quot;).
* Erasing alien encoding inside people&#x27;s brains by having them don the glasses for a few minutes (&quot;Before the Flood&quot;).
* Reading Internet pages and e-mail (&quot;The Zygon Inversion&quot; and &quot;Extremis&quot;).
* Communicating with Gallifreyan battle cruisers (&quot;Hell Bent&quot;).

The glasses appear to be more susceptible to damage than the screwdriver; in &quot;The Girl Who Died&quot;, a Viking warrior takes the glasses off the Doctor&#x27;s face and easily breaks them in half. Nevertheless, the glasses continue to appear via replacement or repair until the end of the season. They return the following season during the Doctor&#x27;s temporary period of blindness, showing the ability to scan his surroundings and transmit the information to his brain, as well as transmit any data recorded to them. However, while he is able to tell things about a person such as height, weight, gender, age, and even heart rate, he does not get enough detail to know faces, clothing, etc. (&quot;Extremis&quot;) He was once able to tell that a person was holding a computer tablet, but not what was written on it, as well as &#x27;see&#x27; a combination lock but not the numbers. (&quot;The Pyramid at the End of the World&quot;) In his final adventure, the Doctor uses the glasses briefly to examine the Testimony interface, much to the confusion and irritation of the First Doctor (&quot;Twice Upon a Time&quot;).

=== 2015–2017 ===
In &quot;Hell Bent&quot;, the TARDIS gives the Doctor a brand new sonic screwdriver. The new screwdriver has a TARDIS-blue shaft with gold and silver highlights. The upper half is a rectangular light grid that, when switched on, has four different functions: green light with low-pitched sound, blue light with high-pitched sound, green lights that pulse with a pulsing sound, and a blue light chasing pattern with a pulsing sound. The new sonic screwdriver is meant to represent the TARDIS. The Doctor first uses it in &quot;The Husbands of River Song&quot; (although he also employs the sonic sunglasses earlier in the episode). The new screwdriver has seen use in the spin-off show &quot;Class&quot;, where the Doctor increases the voltage of flood lights to expel the Shadow Kin and partially close a rift in space-time. He is shown to have working copies of every version of the Sonic Screwdriver ever seen before in a cup on his desk in &quot;The Pilot.&quot; Nardole uses the Fifth Doctor&#x27;s version when sealing bulkhead doors to keep out Daleks later in the episode.

=== 2018–2022 ===
In &quot;The Woman Who Fell to Earth&quot;, the Thirteenth Doctor is depicted constructing a new sonic screwdriver out of scrap metal and an orange glowing device from an alien travel capsule. She proudly proclaims that the new screwdriver is forged out of &quot;Sheffield steel&quot;. This iteration of the sonic screwdriver glows throughout its body with an orange light when activated. It was destroyed by a Dalek in part seven of the Doctor Who Magazine comic strip &quot;Liberation of the Daleks&quot; while in the Fourteenth Doctor&#x27;s possession.

=== 2023 (60th Anniversary Specials) ===
A redesigned sonic screwdriver, made of steel and brass with a long metal protrusion made its debut at San Diego Comic-Con on July 19, 2023. The screwdriver appears to be an amalgamation of different elements from the show such as the TARDIS Roundels, the Daleks&#x27; guns and the Master&#x27;s Laser Screwdriver and was used by the Fourteenth Doctor in the 60th Anniversary Specials.

In the first of the specials &quot;The Star Beast&quot;, this screwdriver is shown to have upgraded functionality, such as being able to draw out maps and graphs, and also being able to create energy shields to block a corridor.

The screwdriver plays no part in the second special &quot;Wild Blue Yonder&quot;, as the Doctor leaves it plugged into the TARDIS to help the machine repair; the TARDIS takes off by itself, with the screwdriver, shortly into the story.

=== 2023–present ===
In December 2023, a reinvention of the sonic screwdriver was introduced for the Fifteenth Doctor. The design is radically different from previous versions, with the shape now resembling a remote control rather than a screwdriver. Gatwa revealed a Gallifreyan script on the sonic, which translates to &quot;the sharpness of the tongue defeats the sharpness of the warrior&quot;, a Rwandan proverb. The sonic also contains a crystal power source and a &quot;USB&quot;-style port which allows it to be connected to other technologies.

According to Phil Sims, production designer, Davies initially expected that the Fifteenth Doctor would continue to use the previous Fourteenth Doctor sonic screwdriver, &quot;the same way he&#x27;d inherit the TARDIS&quot;. Davies later changed his mind, believing it was important for &quot;the new Doctor to have a new sonic&quot;. Michael van Kesteren, prop art director, said that he struggled to come up with a concept; adding that the team had been &quot;quietly hoping not to have to do another one for a while&quot;, as the creation of the previous sonic was &quot;such a complicated, time-consuming process&quot;. Sims opened it up as a &quot;competition&quot; to the art department, with the brief asking for it to be &quot;funky&quot;, &quot;something different&quot; and not limited to &quot;a stick that we point at people&quot;. Davies was interested in changing the shape of the sonic as he worried that it looked too much like a gun:

He also wanted it to be &quot;something every kid would want for Christmas&quot;. Jason Davies-Redgrave, art department co-ordinator, wanted to think &quot;as far out of the box&quot; as he could, and sketched ideas based on a flip phone, a pebble, and an &quot;alien croissant&quot;. The sketches were divisive at first, with Joel Collins, executive producer, elaborating that &quot;if you&#x27;d got out of bed on the wrong side, you might have looked at what Jason had drawn, gone &#x27;what is that?&#x27;, and thrown it in the corner&quot;. Davies strongly supported the sketches, specifically the sketch labelled &#x27;Organic Pebble Teddy Bear version&#x27;. The art department&#x27;s challenge was to translate the chosen sketch into a 3D-printed physical prop. The sonic was designed to be &quot;fully-functioning&quot; with touch controls. Initially, an &quot;all-metal version&quot; was considered, but deemed too expensive. The prop required around 50 component parts, a rechargeable battery, and elastic band technology.

==== BBC Books ====
*The Past Doctor Adventures novel &quot;The Murder Game&quot;, set after &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot;, has the Second Doctor escaping from a locked room with a box-shaped sonic device, in which he muses on the advantages of building a smaller model. The novel &quot;Dreams of Empire&quot; by Justin Richards, set after &quot;The Ice Warriors&quot; and before &quot;Fury from the Deep&quot;, features the Second Doctor using the device to break through a concrete wall. Stories with the device used by the Second Doctor before the screwdriver&#x27;s first on-screen appearance are plausible as the Doctor in that story indicates that the machine &quot;never fails&quot;, implying its successful use before that adventure.
*The &quot;More Short Trips&quot; short story &quot;Special Weapons&quot;, set late in season 24, indicates that the Seventh Doctor has a sonic screwdriver.
*The Eighth Doctor Adventures novel, &quot;Father Time&quot;, features an amnesiac Doctor attempting to recreate the sonic screwdriver with 1980s technology, eventually producing a bulky device nicknamed the &quot;sonic suitcase&quot;.
*In the Ninth Doctor Adventures novel &quot;The Clockwise Man&quot; the sonic screwdriver is used to cauterise wounds, as a soldering iron, and to stop a clockwork mechanism. In &quot;The Monsters Inside&quot; it is used to provide light, but runs out of power in the process. In &quot;Winner Takes All&quot; the Doctor fails to open a lock with it and concludes that it &quot;hints at alien involvement&quot;. It is used to examine electronic standing stones in &quot;The Deviant Strain&quot;. In &quot;Only Human&quot; it is used to restrain someone by welding wires to a chair; in the same novel the Doctor informs Quelly that the device contains 29 computers.
*In the Tenth Doctor Adventures novel &quot;The Stone Rose&quot;, the sonic screwdriver is used to sedate animals. In &quot;The Nightmare of Black Island&quot; it is used to provide light. In &quot;The Last Dodo&quot; it is used to distract animals, and to liquefy and re-solidify tarmac. In &quot;Peacemaker&quot;, it is used to stop bullets and to dismantle guns.

====Big Finish audio dramas====
*In the Big Finish audio drama &quot;Pier Pressure&quot;, Evelyn Smythe mentions that although the Sixth Doctor did not possess a sonic screwdriver, he fondly remembered it as his &quot;door key&quot;. The Sixth Doctor uses his fingernails as a stand-in for the screwdriver as an escape method in &quot;The Nowhere Place&quot;.
*The Seventh Doctor uses the device in &quot;The Harvest&quot; and &quot;Dreamtime&quot;. His companions Ace and Hex use the device in the Doctorless audio drama, &quot;The Veiled Leopard&quot;.
*In &quot;Sword of Orion,&quot; the Eighth Doctor reveals that his sonic screwdriver has a torch built into the handle. In &quot;The Dying Days&quot; he uses the device to reflect the sonic cannon of an Ice Warrior back at his attacker. In &quot;Blood of the Daleks&quot; he uses it to trace a transmission beam.

====&quot;Doctor Who&quot; comics====
*In an untitled story by Gary Russell featured in the first issue of IDW Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comic book (published February 2008), the Tenth Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to destroy a sword and later sacrifices it in order to defeat a Sycorax hunter. Later, he indicates that he needs time to &quot;grow&quot; a new sonic screwdriver.

====Virgin Adventures====
*The Seventh Doctor regained his sonic screwdriver in the Virgin New Adventures novels, with its first reappearance in &quot;The Pit&quot;.
*The Virgin Missing Adventures novel &quot;Venusian Lullaby&quot; established that the First Doctor had a sonic screwdriver.

===Red Nose Day===
*In the Red Nose Day special, &quot;The Curse of Fatal Death&quot;, the final regeneration of the Doctor, played by Joanna Lumley, enthusiastically remarks that the sonic screwdriver &quot;has &quot;three&quot; settings&quot; when it starts vibrating.
*In a comic &quot;The Catherine Tate Show&quot; sketch, Catherine Tate&#x27;s teenage character Lauren Cooper accuses her English teacher (played by David Tennant) of being &quot;the Doctor&quot;. After much provocation, the teacher uses the sonic screwdriver to transform Lauren into a Rose Tyler action figure.

===Unlicensed media===
*The unlicensed fan fiction novel &quot;Time&#x27;s Champion&quot; speculates that the Sixth Doctor has re-built the sonic screwdriver. He used a similar device in &quot;The Nightmare Fair&quot;, a script which was never produced for television but has been adapted twice.
*In the video game &quot;Daleks&quot; (published for operating systems of the early 1980s), the Doctor can use the sonic screwdriver to teleport and to defend himself against the Daleks.

===Public appearances===
*Matt Smith used the Eleventh Doctor&#x27;s sonic screwdriver to turn on the Christmas Lights in Cardiff in November 2010. Its appearance was cheered by the crowd. During the Doctor Who panel at San Diego Comic-Con in 2018, Jodie Whittaker produced the new sonic screwdriver, prompting applause from the audience.

==Related devices==
===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
*The Doctor has used other sonic devices similar to the sonic screwdriver, including the &quot;door handle&quot; of &quot;Inferno&quot; (Liz Shaw having one of her own) and a pen-sized white noise generator in &quot;Four to Doomsday&quot;.
*In the 1965 episode &quot;Trap of Steel&quot;, the Doctor uses an apparently &quot;ordinary&quot; screwdriver to examine the metal of the Drahvin spaceship and other tasks.
*In the 1979 serial &quot;City of Death&quot;, Count Scarlioni&#x27;s henchmen use a &quot;sonic knife&quot; to cut the glass in front of the Mona Lisa.
*In the 1985 serial &quot;Attack of the Cybermen&quot;, the Sixth Doctor uses a &quot;sonic lance&quot;.
*In the 2005 episodes &quot;The Empty Child&quot; and &quot;The Doctor Dances&quot;, Jack Harkness uses a &quot;sonic blaster&quot;, referred to by Rose Tyler as a &quot;squareness gun&quot;, capable of &quot;digitising&quot; structures by disintegrating them and then reversing the process, among other functions. The device resurfaces in &quot;Silence in the Library&quot; and &quot;Forest of the Dead&quot;, now wielded by River Song. Steven Moffat confirmed in an episode of &quot;Doctor Who Confidential&quot; that the device was the same one.
*In &quot;Smith and Jones&quot;, Martha Jones sarcastically asks if he&#x27;s got a &quot;laser spanner&quot; as well as a sonic screwdriver, which he apparently did until it was stolen by Emmeline Pankhurst, described by the Doctor as a &quot;cheeky woman&quot;.
*In &quot;The Sound of Drums&quot;, the Master reveals his laser screwdriver. Unlike the sonic screwdriver, it is used as a weapon that can kill as well as artificially age its target, using technology developed by Lazarus Laboratories originally seen in &quot;The Lazarus Experiment&quot;. It includes isomorphic controls, allowing only the Master to use the device. The design of the prop was meant to imply that the Master constructed it on Earth, and it was deliberately made larger than the Doctor&#x27;s sonic screwdriver. Like the Doctor&#x27;s screwdriver and Sarah Jane&#x27;s lipstick, the Master&#x27;s laser screwdriver was also created as a children&#x27;s toy with sound effects. The laser screwdriver reappears in The Doctor Falls when the Master encounters his later female incarnation, Missy. Again, his screwdriver acts as a weapon, the Master using it to destroy a Cyberman and to kill Missy, shooting her in the back after she stabbed him in the back.
*In the series 4 episode &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;, the antagonist Miss Foster is shown using a sonic device identified as a sonic pen, which the Doctor describes as having identical functionality to his screwdriver. It could, however, open deadlocked windows and compartments in the Adipose building that the sonic screwdriver could not. After confiscating and briefly using it, the Doctor throws the sonic pen into a bin. The sonic pen took the form of a sleek, black and silver fountain pen with a blue light at the top and was made into a toy version which was paired with the sonic screwdriver.
*In &quot;Silence in the Library&quot;, Professor River Song possesses a slightly bulkier sonic screwdriver, which she claims the Doctor gave to her in his future. The Doctor mentioned that he does not give his screwdriver to anyone. In the following episode, Professor Song mentions that her screwdriver is augmented with a &quot;red setting&quot; and &quot;dampers&quot;. It also contains a hidden neural relay linked to River Song, saving her at the episode&#x27;s conclusion—the purpose for which the future Doctor gave Professor Song the device. A toy version is available. It was revealed in &quot;The Husbands of River Song&quot; that it was the Twelfth Doctor who gave it to River.
*In &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot;, Sarah Jane Smith is seen using her own sonic screwdriver, or &quot;sonic lipstick&quot; to open a door on the Dalek Crucible.
*In the Christmas special &quot;The Next Doctor&quot;, Jackson Lake, who believes himself to be the Doctor, carries a regular screwdriver which he claims to be sonic. When the Doctor asks &quot;How is it sonic?&quot;, Lake replies, &quot;It makes a noise,&quot; which he demonstrates by tapping it against a door frame.
*In the series 6 episode &quot;Let&#x27;s Kill Hitler&quot;, the Doctor has a sonic cane which appears to have the same functions as the sonic screwdriver.
*In the series 6 episode &quot;The Girl Who Waited&quot;, future Amy Pond has a &quot;Sonic Probe&quot; that she made herself. She claims she calls it a probe and not a screwdriver because that&#x27;s what it is, and to signify that she has come to hate the Doctor. Later after she has forgiven him, she calls it a sonic screwdriver.
*Blue Peter announced that there will be three Sonic devices that will feature in Series 8 of Doctor Who, designed by Blue Peter watchers. The first device is a Sonic Gauntlet for Jenny Flint that will feature making locks fall apart, radioactivity counter and receiver dish, that will allow you to watch shows. The Second device is a Sonic Lorgnette for Commander Strax that has medical applications, such as X-ray, diagnostic lens (check for illness), and thermal lens. The third device is Sonic Hat Pin for Madame Vastra that can be used as a remote control for her carriage and it can also be turned into a Sonic Sword with the flick of a switch.

===&quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;===
In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off series, &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, Sarah Jane Smith uses a &quot;sonic lipstick&quot;, which is a gift the Tenth Doctor gave her alongside a new model of K9 and her scanner watch. It functions much like the sonic screwdriver, used primarily for opening and closing locked doors, and for disabling and re-enabling machines; like the sonic screwdriver, it remains ineffective against deadlock seals and wooden objects. A toy version is available.
*In &quot;Enemy of the Bane&quot;, Mrs Wormwood (Samantha Bond) possesses a sonic device disguised as a ring called the &quot;Phonic disruptor&quot;.

=== &quot;Torchwood&quot; ===
*In the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off series &quot;Torchwood&quot; episode &quot;Fragments&quot;, genius Toshiko Sato&#x27;s backstory reveals that she stole faulty designs from the Ministry of Defence and UNIT, which she used to construct a sonic device, referred to as a &quot;sonic modulator&quot;, to trade to a terrorist organisation in exchange for her mother. The device is confiscated by UNIT, which imprisons Sato until she is pardoned and recruited into Torchwood by Jack Harkness.
*In the episodes &quot;Day One&quot; and &quot;End of Days&quot;, Captain Jack Harkness uses a green device somewhat similar to a sonic screwdriver. Its origins and function are unknown.
* Toshiko uses a &quot;lockpick&quot; device in a number of episodes which replicates the door-opening function of the screwdriver.
*In &quot;&quot;, Gwen Cooper uses a similar device, which she refers to as a Gizmo, to deactivate CCTV cameras.

=== BBC books ===
*In the Eighth Doctor Adventures novel &quot;Alien Bodies&quot;, the Time Lord Homunculette has a sonic monkey wrench.

== Commercial product ==
Ownership of the sonic screwdriver was retained by the BBC. Victor Pemberton told an interviewer for &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m very cross that the sonic screwdriver—which I invented—has been marketed with no credit to myself. … It&#x27;s one thing not to receive any payment, but another not to receive any credit.&quot;

The toy version of the new series design (made by Character Options Ltd.) was slightly larger than the on screen version to accommodate a working sound chip. It also includes an ultraviolet light and changeable invisible ink nib for viewing messages written in the ultraviolet ink.

A metal version of the sonic screwdriver produced by Wow Stuff mounts a functional set of changeable flat and Phillips heads under a removable cover as well as providing light and sound effects.

QMx were given the licence to produce accurate replicas of this prop. In 2012, QMx released an &quot;Artisan Master Series&quot; replica of this sonic screwdriver, in a strictly limited run of 25, priced at nearly $5,000. These replicas were handmade by original prop-maker Nick Robatto, and have now sold out permanently. QMx later released an Artisan Master Series replica of River Song&#x27;s sonic screwdriver, limited to a run of 15, also made by original prop maker Nick Robatto, which has also sold out.

The Wand Company released a universal remote control styled on the Eleventh Doctor&#x27;s sonic screwdriver on 3 August 2012. Due to consumer demand, a Tenth Doctor version was released on 31 October 2013. An updated, extending version of the Eleventh Doctor&#x27;s Sonic Screwdriver, named the Twelfth Doctor&#x27;s Sonic Screwdriver Universal Remote Control, was released on 8 July 2015, to replace the older version, which is no longer produced.

Underground Toys have released the War Doctor&#x27;s sonic screwdriver; titled &quot;The Other Doctor&#x27;s Sonic Screwdriver&quot;, it was released in the UK in November/December 2013 and in the US January 2014.

Character Options have also released toy versions of the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Doctors&#x27; Sonic Screwdrivers.

<doc id="27614" wikidata="Q428152" url="?curid=27614" title="Slide guitar">
<text>Slide guitar is a technique for playing the guitar that is often used in blues music. It involves playing a guitar while holding a hard object (a [[Steel bar|slide]]) against the strings, creating the opportunity for glissando effects and deep vibratos that reflect characteristics of the human singing voice. It typically involves playing the guitar in the traditional position (flat against the body) with the use of a slide fitted on one of the guitarist&#x27;s fingers. The slide may be a metal or glass tube, such as the neck of a bottle, giving rise to the term bottleneck guitar to describe this type of playing. The strings are typically plucked (not strummed) while the slide is moved over the strings to change the pitch. The guitar may also be placed on the player&#x27;s lap and played with a hand-held bar (lap steel guitar).

Creating music with a slide of some type has been traced back to African stringed instruments and also to the origin of the steel guitar in Hawaii. Near the beginning of the twentieth century, blues musicians in the Mississippi Delta popularized the bottleneck slide guitar style, and the first recording of slide guitar was by Sylvester Weaver in 1923. Since the 1930s, performers including Robert Johnson, Robert Nighthawk, Earl Hooker, Elmore James, and Muddy Waters popularized slide guitar in electric blues and influenced later slide guitarists in rock music, including the Rolling Stones, George Harrison, Duane Allman, and Ry Cooder. Lap slide guitar pioneers include Oscar &quot;Buddy&quot; Woods, &quot;Black Ace&quot; Turner, and Freddie Roulette.

== History ==

The technique of using a hard object against a plucked string goes back to the diddley bow derived from a one-stringed African instrument. The diddley bow is believed to be one of the ancestors of the bottleneck style. When sailors from Europe introduced the Spanish guitar to Hawaii in the latter nineteenth century, the Hawaiians slackened some of the strings from the standard guitar tuning to make a chordthis became known as &quot;slack-key&quot; guitar, today referred to as an open tuning. With the &quot;slack-key&quot; the Hawaiians found it easy to play a three-chord song by moving a piece of metal along the fretboard and began to play the instrument across the lap. Near the end of the nineteenth century, a Hawaiian named Joseph Kekuku became proficient in playing this way using a steel bar against the guitar strings. The bar was called the &quot;steel&quot; and was the source of the name &quot;steel guitar&quot;. Kekuku popularized the method and some sources claim he originated the technique. In the first half of the twentieth century, this so-called &quot;Hawaiian guitar&quot; style of playing spread to the US. Sol Hoʻopiʻi was an influential Hawaiian guitarist who in 1919, at age 17, came to the US mainland from Hawaii as a stow-away on a ship heading for San Francisco. Hoʻopiʻi&#x27;s playing became popular in the late 1920s and he recorded songs like &quot;Hula Blues&quot; and &quot;Farewell Blues&quot;. According to author Pete Madsen, &quot;[Hoʻopiʻi&#x27;s playing] would influence a legion of players from rural Mississippi.&quot;

Most players of blues slide guitar were from the southern US, particularly the Mississippi Delta, and their music was likely from an African origin handed down to African-American sharecroppers who sang as they toiled in the fields. The earliest Delta blues musicians were largely solo singer-guitarists. W. C. Handy commented on the first time he heard slide guitar in 1903, when a blues player performed in a local train station: &quot;As he played, he pressed a knife on the strings of the guitar in a manner popularised by Hawaiian guitarists who used steel bars. The effect was unforgettable.&quot;
Blues historian Gérard Herzhaft notes that Tampa Red was one of the first black musicians inspired by the Hawaiian guitarists of the beginning of the century, and he managed to adapt their sound to the blues. Tampa Red, as well as Kokomo Arnold, Casey Bill Weldon, and Oscar Woods adopted the Hawaiian mode of playing longer melodies with the slide instead of playing short riffs as they had done previously.

In the early twentieth century, steel guitar playing was divided into two streams: bottleneck-style, performed on a traditional Spanish guitar held flat against the body; and lap-style, performed on an instrument specifically designed or modified for the purpose of being played on the performer&#x27;s lap. The bottleneck-style was typically associated with blues music and was popularized by African-American blues artists. The Mississippi Delta was the home of Robert Johnson, Son House, Charlie Patton, and other blues pioneers who prominently used the slide. The first known recording of the bottleneck style was in 1923 by Sylvester Weaver who recorded two instrumentals, &quot;Guitar Blues&quot; and &quot;Guitar Rag&quot;. Guitarist and author Woody Mann identifies Tampa Red and Blind Willie Johnson as &quot;developing the most distinctive styles in the recorded idom&quot; of the time. He adds:
== Influential early electric slide guitarists ==
When the guitar was electrified in the 1930s, it allowed solos on the instrument to be more audible, and thus more prominently featured. In the 1940s, players like Robert Nighthawk and Earl Hooker popularized electric slide guitar; but, unlike their predecessors, they used standard tuning. This allowed them to switch between slide and fretted guitar playing readily, which was an advantage in rhythm accompaniment.

=== Robert Nighthawk ===
Robert Nighthawk (born Robert Lee McCollum) recorded extensively in the 1930s as &quot;Robert Lee McCoy&quot; with bluesmen such as John Lee &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; Williamson (also known as Sonny Boy Williamson I). He performed on acoustic guitar in a style influenced by Tampa Red. Sometime around World War II, after changing his last name to &quot;Nighthawk&quot; (from the title of one of his songs), he became an early proponent of electric slide guitar and adopted a metal slide. Nighthawk&#x27;s sound was extremely clean and smooth, with a very light touch of the slide against the strings. He helped popularize Tampa Red&#x27;s &quot;Black Angel Blues&quot; (later called &quot;Sweet Little Angel&quot;), &quot;Crying Won&#x27;t Help You&quot;, and &quot;Anna Lou Blues&quot; (as &quot;Anna Lee&quot;) in his electric slide style-songs which later became part of the repertoire of Earl Hooker, B.B. King, and others. His style influenced both Muddy Waters and Hooker. Nighthawk is credited as one who helped bring music from Mississippi into the Chicago blues style of electric blues.

=== Earl Hooker ===
As a teenager, Earl Hooker (a cousin of John Lee Hooker) sought out Nighthawk as his teacher and in the late 1940s the two toured the South extensively. Nighthawk had a lasting impact on Hooker&#x27;s playing; however, by the time of his 1953 recording of &quot;Sweet Angel&quot; (a tribute of sorts to Nighthawk&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Little Angel&quot;), Hooker had developed an advanced style of his own. His solos had a resemblance to the human singing voice and music writer Andy Grigg commented: &quot;He had the uncanny ability to make his guitar weep, moan and talk just like a person... his slide playing was peerless, even exceeding his mentor, Robert Nighthawk.&quot; The vocal approach is heard in Hooker&#x27;s instrumental, &quot;Blue Guitar&quot;, which was later overdubbed with a unison vocal by Muddy Waters and became &quot;You Shook Me&quot;. Unusual for a blues player, Hooker explored using a wah-wah pedal in the 1960s to further emulate the human voice.

=== Elmore James ===

Possibly the most influential electric blues slide guitarist of his era was Elmore James, who gained prominence with his 1951 song &quot;Dust My Broom&quot;, a remake of Robert Johnson&#x27;s 1936 song, &quot;I Believe I&#x27;ll Dust My Broom&quot;. It features James playing a series of triplets throughout the song which &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine called &quot;one immortal lick&quot; and is heard in many blues songs to this day. Although Johnson had used the figure on several songs, James&#x27; overdriven electric sound made it &quot;more insistent, firing out a machine-gun triplet beat that would become a defining sound of the early rockers&quot;, writes historian Ted Gioia. Unlike Nighthawk and Hooker, James used a full-chord glissando effect with an open E tuning and a bottleneck. Other popular songs by James, such as &quot;It Hurts Me Too&quot; (first recorded by Tampa Red), &quot;The Sky Is Crying&quot;, &quot;Shake Your Moneymaker&quot;, feature his slide playing.

=== Muddy Waters ===
Although Muddy Waters, born McKinley Morganfield, made his earliest recordings using an acoustic slide guitar, as a guitarist, he was best known for his electric slide playing. Muddy Waters helped bring the Delta blues to Chicago and was instrumental in defining the city&#x27;s electric blues style. He was also one of the pioneers of electric slide guitar. Beginning with &quot;I Can&#x27;t Be Satisfied&quot; (1948), many of his hit songs featured slide, including &quot;Rollin&#x27; and Tumblin&#x27;&quot;, &quot;Rollin&#x27; Stone&quot; (whose name was adopted by the well-known rock band and the magazine), &quot;Louisiana Blues&quot;, and &quot;Still a Fool&quot;. Waters used an open G tuning for several of his earlier songs, but later switched to a standard tuning and often used a capo to change keys. He usually played single notes with a small metal slide on his little finger and dampened the strings combined with varying the volume to control the amount of distortion. According to writer Ted Drozdowski, &quot;One last factor to consider is slide vibrato that is achieved by shaking a slide back and forth. Muddy’s slide vibrato was insane, both manic and controlled. That added to the excitement of his playing.&quot;

== Early developments in rock music ==
Rock musicians began exploring electric slide guitar in the early 1960s. In the UK, groups such as the Rolling Stones, who were fans of Chicago blues and Chess Records artists in particular, began recording songs by Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x27; Wolf, and others. The Stones&#x27; second single, &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot; (1963), featured a slide guitar break by Brian Jones, which may be the first appearance of a slide on a rock record. Critic Richie Unterberger commented, &quot;Particularly outstanding was Brian Jones&#x27;s slide guitar, whose wailing howl gave the tune a raunchy bluesiness missing in the Beatles&#x27; more straightforward rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll arrangement.&quot; Jones also played slide on their 1964 single &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot;, which reached number one on the British charts. One of his last contributions to a Stones recording was his acoustic guitar slide playing on &quot;No Expectations&quot;, which biographer Paul Trynka describes as &quot;subtle, totally without bombast or overemphasis... the perfect embodiment of the journey he&#x27;d embarked on in 1961.&quot;

In Chicago, Mike Bloomfield frequented blues clubs as early as the late 1950sby the early 1960s Muddy Waters and harmonica virtuoso Little Walter encouraged him and occasionally allowed him to sit in on jam sessions. Waters recalled: &quot;Mike was a great guitar player. He learned a lot of slide from me. Plus I guess he picked up a little lick or two from me, but he learned how to play a lot of slide and pick a lot of guitar.&quot; Bloomfield&#x27;s slide playing attracted Paul Butterfield and, together with guitarist Elvin Bishop, they formed the classic lineup of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band. Their first album, &quot;The Paul Butterfield Blues Band&quot; (1965), features Bloomfield&#x27;s slide guitar work on the band&#x27;s adaptations of two Elmore James songs. &quot;Shake Your Moneymaker&quot; shows his well-developed slide style and &quot;Look Over Yonders Wall&quot; is ranked at number 27 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot;. Around the same time, he recorded with Bob Dylan for the &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; album and contributed the distinctive slide guitar to the title track. On the second Butterfield album, &quot;East-West&quot; (1966), songs such as &quot;Walkin&#x27; Blues&quot; and &quot;Two Trains Running&quot; include slide playing that brought him to the audience&#x27;s attention.
Ry Cooder was a child music prodigy and at age 15 began working on bottleneck guitar techniques and learned Robert Johnson songs. In 1964, Cooder, along with Taj Mahal, formed the Rising Sons, one of the earliest blues rock bands. His early guitar work appears on Captain Beefheart&#x27;s debut &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; album (1967) and several songs on Taj Mahal&#x27;s self-titled 1968 debut album. Also in 1968, he collaborated with the Rolling Stones on recording sessions, which resulted in Cooder playing slide on &quot;Memo from Turner&quot;. The Jagger/Richards song was later included on the soundtrack to the 1970 film &quot;Performance&quot;; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it at number 92 on its &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot; list. In 1970, he recorded his own self titled debut album, which included the Blind Willie Johnson classic slide instrumental &quot;Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground&quot; (re-recorded in 1984 for the soundtrack to &quot;Paris, Texas&quot;). Recognized as a master of slide guitar by 1967, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked him at number eight on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; in 2003.

Duane Allman’s slide-playing with the Allman Brothers Band was one of the formative influences in the creation of Southern rock. He also added memorable slide guitar to Derek and the Dominos’ &quot;Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs&quot; album, notably its title track, which was ranked at number 13 on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s&quot; &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs&quot;. Allman, who died in a motorcycle accident at age 24, was hailed by NPR&#x27;s Nick Morrison as &quot;the most inventive slide guitarist of his era&quot;. He extended the role of the slide guitar by mimicking the harmonica effects of Sonny Boy Williamson II, most clearly in the Allman Brothers&#x27; rendition of Williamson&#x27;s &quot;One Way Out&quot;, recorded live at the Fillmore East and heard on their album &quot;Eat a Peach&quot;.

== Technique ==
The slide guitar, according to music educator Keith Wyatt, can be thought of as a &quot;one-finger fretless guitar&quot;. The placement of a slide on a string determines the pitch, functioning in the manner of a steel guitar. The slide is pressed lightly against the treble strings to avoid hitting against the frets. The frets are used here only as a visual reference, and playing without their pitch-constraint enables the smooth expressive glissandos that typify blues music. This playing technique creates a hybrid of the attributes of a steel guitar and a traditional guitar in that the player&#x27;s remaining (non-slide) fingers and thumb still have access to the frets, and may be used for playing rhythmic accompaniment or reaching additional notes. The guitar itself may be tuned in the traditional tuning or an open tuning. Most early blues players used open tunings, but most modern slide players use both. The major limitation of open tuning is that usually only one chord or voicing is easily available and is dictated by how the guitar is originally tuned. Two-note intervals can be played by slanting the slide on certain notes.

In the sixteenth century, the notes of A–D–G–B–E were adopted as a tuning for guitar-like instruments, and the low E was added later to make E–A–D–G–B–E as the standard guitar tuning. In open tuning the strings are tuned to sound a chord when not fretted, and is most often major. Open tunings commonly used with slide guitar include open D or Vestapol tuning: D–A–D–F–A–D; and open G or Spanish tuning: D–G–D–G–B–D. Open E and open A, formed by raising each of those tunings a whole tone, are also common. Other tunings are also used, in particular the drop D tuning (low E string tuned down to D) is used by many slide players. This tuning allows for power chords, which contain root, fifth and eighth (octave) notes in the bass strings and conventional tuning for the rest of the strings. Robert Johnson, whose playing has been cited by Eric Clapton, Keith Richards, Jimi Hendrix, and Johnny Winter as being a powerful influence on them, used tunings of standard, open G, open D, and drop D.

== Resonator guitars ==
The National String Instrument Corporation produced the first metal-body resonator guitars in the late 1920s (&quot;see image at beginning of article&quot;). Popular with early slide players, these featured a large aluminum cone, resembling an inverted loudspeaker, attached under the instrument&#x27;s bridge to increase its volume. It was patented in the late 1920s by the Dopyera brothers and became widely used on many types of guitars, and was adapted to the mandolin and ukulele.

Tampa Red played a gold-plated National Tricone style 4, and was one of the first black musicians to record with it. Delta blues pioneer, Son House, played this type of guitar on many songs including the classic, &quot;Death Letter&quot;. A resonator guitar with a metal body was played by Bukka White (&quot;Parchman Farm Blues&quot; and &quot;Fixin&#x27; to Die Blues&quot;).

== Lap slide guitar ==
&quot;Lap slide guitar&quot; does not refer to a specific instrument, rather a style of playing blues or rock music with the guitar placed horizontally, a position historically known as Hawaiian style. This is a lap-steel guitar, but musicians in these genres prefer the term slide instead of steel; they sometimes play the style with a flat pick or with fingers instead of finger picks. There are various instruments specifically made (or adapted) to play in the horizontal position, including the following:
* a traditional guitar that has been adapted for lap slide playing by raising the bridge and/or the nut to make the strings higher off the fretboard;
* steel guitars, (electrified) including lap steel, console steel, and pedal steel, in which a solid metal bar, typically referred to as a &quot;steel&quot;, is pressed against the strings and is the source of the name steel guitar;
* a National or Dobro-type guitar. These are typically acoustic steel guitars with a resonator. Each manufacturer made wood and steel-bodied versions, but National is most associated with the latter. The types do not sound the same — the Nationals are brassier and are usually preferred by blues players. Nationals can be played either in the traditional position or horizontally.
* a Hawaiian-style guitar modified by adding drone and sympathetic strings used in Indian classical music known as a mohan veena.

== Lap slide guitar pioneers ==

Buddy Woods was a Louisiana street performer who recorded in the 1930s. He was called &quot;The Lone Wolf&quot; after the title of his most successful song, &quot;Lone Wolf Blues&quot;. Between 1936 and 1938, he recorded ten songs that are today considered classics, including &quot;Don&#x27;t Sell It, Don&#x27;t Give It Away&quot;. Woods recorded five songs for the US Library of Congress in 1940 in Shreveport, Louisiana, including &quot;Boll Weevil Blues&quot; and &quot;Sometimes I Get a Thinkin&#x27;&quot;.

&quot;Black Ace&quot; Turner (born Babe Karo Turner), a blues artist from Texas, was befriended and mentored by Buddy Woods. Historian Gérard Herzhaft said, &quot;Black Ace is one of the few blues guitarists to have played in the purest Hawaiian style, that is, with the guitar flat on the knees.&quot; Turner played a square-neck National &quot;style 2&quot; Tri-cone metal body guitar and used a glass medicine bottle as a slide. Turner was also a good storyteller, which enabled him to host a radio program in Fort Worth called &quot;The Black Ace&quot;. His career effectively ended when he entered military service in 1943. His album, &quot;I Am the Boss Card in Your Hand&quot;, contained Turner&#x27;s original 1930s recordings as well as new songs recorded in 1960. Turner was featured in a 1962 documentary film entitled &quot;The Blues&quot;.

Freddie Roulette (born Frederick Martin Roulette) is a San Francisco-based lap steel blues artist who became interested in the lap steel guitar at an early age and became proficient enough to play in Chicago blues clubs with prominent players. He played an A7 tuning with a slant-bar style and never used finger picks. He earned a spot in Earl Hooker&#x27;s band and recorded with Hooker in the 1960s. Roulette had played lap steel in other genres before focusing on blueshe stated this helped him add more complex chords to the basic blues played by Hooker and said, &quot;it worked&quot;. Roulette was recruited to San Francisco in the mid-1970s by Charlie Musselwhite. In 1997, he recorded a solo album, &quot;Back in Chicago: Jammin&#x27; with Willie Kent and the Gents&quot;, which won Best Blues Album of 1997 by &quot;Living Blues Magazine&quot;. Roulette&#x27;s contribution to the lap slide guitar was to prove that a lap-played instrument was capable of holding its own in Chicago blues style.

== Slides and steels ==

A slide used around a player&#x27;s finger can be made with any type of smooth hard material that allows tones to resonate. Different materials cause subtle differences in sustain, timbre, and loudness; glass or metal are the most common choices. Longer slides are used to bridge across all six guitar strings at once, but take away the fretting ability of that finger entirely. A shorter slide allows the fingertip to protrude from the slide and allow that finger to be used to fret.

Improvised slides are common, including pipes, rings, knives, spoons, and glass bottlenecks. Early blues players sometimes used a knife, such as Blind Willie Johnson (pocket- or penknife) and CeDell Davis (butterknife). Duane Allman used a glass Coricidin medicine bottle. Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett was fond of using a Zippo lighter as a slide, but this was largely for special effects. Jimi Hendrix also used a cigarette lighter for part of his solo on &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot;. It is one of the few recordings with Hendrix on slide, and biographer Harry Shapiro notes he performed it with the guitar on his lap.

For guitars designed to be played on the lap, the performer uses a solid piece of steel rather than a hollow tube. The choice of shape and size is a matter of personal preference. The most common steel is a solid metal cylinder with one end rounded into a dome shape. Some lap slide guitar players choose a steel with a deep indentation or groove on each side so it can be held firmly, and may have squared-off ends. The better grip may facilitate playing the rapid vibratos in blues music. This design facilitates hammer-on and pull-off notes.

<text>A steel guitar () is any guitar played while moving a steel bar or similar hard object against plucked strings. The bar itself is called a &quot;steel&quot; and is the source of the name &quot;steel guitar&quot;. The instrument differs from a conventional guitar in that it is played without using frets; conceptually, it is somewhat akin to playing a guitar with one finger (the bar). Known for its portamento capabilities, gliding smoothly over every pitch between notes, the instrument can produce a sinuous crying sound and deep vibrato emulating the human singing voice. Typically, the strings are plucked (not strummed) by the fingers of the dominant hand, while the steel tone bar is pressed lightly against the strings and moved by the opposite hand.

The idea of creating music with a slide of some type has been traced back to early African instruments, but the modern steel guitar was conceived and popularized in the Hawaiian Islands. The Hawaiians began playing a conventional guitar in a horizontal position across the knees instead of flat against the body, using the bar instead of fingers. Joseph Kekuku developed this manner of playing a guitar, known as &quot;Hawaiian style&quot;, about 1890 and the technique spread internationally.

The sound of Hawaiian music featuring steel guitar became an enduring musical fad in the United States in the first half of the twentieth century and in 1916 recordings of indigenous Hawaiian music outsold all other U.S. musical genres. This popularity spawned the manufacture of guitars designed specifically to be played horizontally. The archetypal instrument is the Hawaiian guitar, also called a lap steel. These early acoustic instruments were not loud enough relative to other instruments, but that changed in 1934 when a steel guitarist named George Beauchamp invented the electric guitar pickup. Electrification allowed these instruments to be heard, and it also meant their resonant chambers were no longer essential. Now steel guitars could be manufactured in any design, even a rectangular block bearing little or no resemblance to the traditional guitar shape. The result were table-like instruments in a metal frame on legs called &quot;console steels&quot;, which were technologically improved about 1950 to become the more versatile pedal steel guitar.

In the United States, the steel guitar influenced popular music in the early twentieth century, combining with jazz, swing and country music to be prominently heard in Western swing, honky-tonk, gospel and bluegrass. The instrument influenced Blues artists in the Mississippi Delta who embraced the steel guitar sound but continued holding their guitar in the traditional way; they used a tubular object (the neck of a bottle) called a &quot;slide&quot; around a finger. This technique, historically called &quot;bottleneck&quot; guitar, is now known as &quot;slide guitar&quot; and is commonly associated with blues and rock music. Bluegrass artists adapted the Hawaiian style of playing in a resonator guitar known as a &quot;Dobro&quot;, a type of steel guitar with either a round or square neck, sometimes played with the musician standing and the guitar facing upward held horizontally by a shoulder strap.

==History==
In the late 19th century, European sailors and Portuguese vaqueros, hired by Hawaii&#x27;s king to work cattle ranches, introduced Spanish guitars in the Hawaiian Islands. For whatever reason, Hawaiians did not embrace standard guitar tuning that had been in use for centuries. They re-tuned their guitars to make them sound a major chord when all six strings were strummed, now known as an &quot;open tuning&quot;. The term for this is &quot;slack-key&quot; because certain strings were &quot;slackened&quot; to achieve it. Steel guitar strings, then a novelty, offered new possibilities to the islanders. To change chords, they used some smooth object, usually a piece of pipe or metal, sliding it over the strings to the fourth or fifth position, easily playing a three-chord song. It is physically difficult to hold a steel bar against the strings while holding the guitar against the body (hand supinated) so the Hawaiians placed the guitar across the lap and played it with the hand pronated. Playing this way became popular throughout Hawai&#x27;i and spread internationally.

Oahu-born Joseph Kekuku became proficient in this style of playing around the end of the 19th century and popularized it—some sources say he invented the steel guitar. He moved to the U.S. and became a vaudeville performer and also toured Europe performing Hawaiian music. The Hawaiian style of playing spread to America and became popular during the first half of the 20th century; noted players of the era were Frank Ferera, Sam Ku West, &quot;King&quot; Bennie Nawahi and Sol Hoʻopiʻi. Hoʻopiʻi ( ) was perhaps the most famous of the Hawaiians who spread the sound of instrumental lap steel worldwide. This music became popular to the degree that it was called the &quot;Hawaiian craze&quot; and was ignited by a number of events.

The annexation of Hawai&#x27;i as a U.S. territory in 1900 stimulated Americans&#x27; interest in Hawaiian music and customs. In 1912, a Broadway musical show called &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot; premiered; it featured Hawaiian music and elaborate costumes. The show became quite successful and, to ride this wave of success, it toured the U.S. and Europe, eventually spawning the 1932 film &quot;Bird of Paradise&quot;. Joseph Kekuku was a member of the show&#x27;s original cast and toured with the show for eight years. In 1918, &quot;The Washington Herald&quot; stated, &quot;So great is the popularity of Hawaiian music in this country that &#x27;The Bird of Paradise&#x27; will go on record as having created the greatest musical fad this country has ever known&quot;.
In 1915, a world&#x27;s fair called the Panama–Pacific International Exposition was held in San Francisco to celebrate the opening of the Panama Canal and over a nine-month period introduced the Hawaiian style of guitar playing to millions of visitors. In 1916, recordings of indigenous Hawaiian instruments outsold every other genre of music in the U.S.

Radio broadcasts played a role in fueling the popularity of Hawaiian music. &quot;Hawaii Calls&quot; was a program originating in Hawai&#x27;i and broadcast to the U.S. mainland west coast. It featured the steel guitar, ukulele, and Hawaiian songs sung in English. Subsequently, the program was heard worldwide on over 750 stations. Sol Hoʻopiʻi began broadcasting live from KHJ radio in Los Angeles in 1923. By the 1920s, Hawaiian music instruction for children was becoming common in the U.S. One of the steel guitar&#x27;s foremost virtuosos, Buddy Emmons, studied at the Hawaiian Conservatory of Music in South Bend, Indiana, at age 11 in 1948.

The acceptance of the sound of the steel guitar, then referred to as &quot;Hawaiian guitars&quot; or &quot;lap steels&quot;, spurred instrument makers to produce them in quantity and create innovations in the design to accommodate this style of playing.
In the early twentieth century, steel guitar playing branched off into two streams: lap-style, performed on an instrument specifically designed or modified to be played on the performer&#x27;s lap; and bottleneck-style, performed on a traditional Spanish guitar held flat against the body. The bottleneck-style became associated with blues and rock music, and the horizontal style became associated with several musical genres, including Hawaiian music, country music, Western swing, honky-tonk, bluegrass and gospel.

==Use in musical genres==
===Blues music===
Solo African-American blues artists popularized the bottleneck-style (slide guitar) near the beginning of the twentieth century. One of the first southern blues musicians to adapt the Hawaiian sound to the blues was Tampa Red, whose playing, says historian Gérard Herzhaft, &quot;created a style that has unquestionably influenced all modern blues&quot;. The Mississippi Delta was the home of Robert Johnson, Son House, Charlie Patton and other blues pioneers, who used a prominent tubular slide on a finger. The first known recording of the bottleneck style was in 1923 by Sylvester Weaver, who recorded two instrumentals, &quot;Guitar Blues&quot; and &quot;Guitar Rag&quot;. Western swing pioneers Bob Wills and Leon McAuliffe adapted his song, &quot;Guitar Rag&quot;, in 1935 for the influential instrumental &quot;Steel Guitar Rag&quot;. Blues musicians played a conventional Spanish guitar as a hybrid between the two types of guitars, using one finger inserted into a tubular slide or a bottleneck with one finger while using frets with the remaining fingers (usually for rhythm accompaniment). This technique allows the player to finger the frets on some strings and use the slide on others. Slide players may use open tunings or traditional tunings as a matter of personal preference. Lap slide guitar is not a specific instrument but a style of playing a lap steel guitar usually referring to blues or rock music.

===Country music===
The earliest record of a Hawaiian guitar used in country music is believed to be in the early 1920s when cowboy movie star Hoot Gibson brought Sol Hoʻopiʻi to Los Angeles to perform in his band. In 1927, the acoustic duo of Darby and Tarleton expanded the audience for acoustic steel guitar with their Columbia recording of &quot;Birmingham Jail&quot; and &quot;Columbus Stockade Blues&quot;. Jimmie Rodgers featured an acoustic steel guitar on his song &quot;Tuck Away My Lonesome Blues&quot; released on January 3, 1930. In the early 1930s, acoustic lap steel guitars were not loud enough to compete with other instruments, a problem that many inventors were trying to remedy.

====Resonator guitars====
In 1927, the Dopyera brothers patented the resonator guitar, a non-electric device resembling a large inverted loudspeaker cone attached under the bridge of a guitar to make it louder. The name &quot;Dobro&quot;, a portmanteau of DOpyera and BROthers, became a generic term for this type of guitar, popularized by Pete Kirby (&quot;Bashful Brother Oswald&quot;) on Nashville&#x27;s Grand Ole Opry for 30 years with Roy Acuff&#x27;s band. He played the instrument while standing with the guitar facing upward held horizontally by a shoulder strap. Oswald&#x27;s Dobro attracted interest and fascination; he said, &quot;People couldn&#x27;t understand how I played it and what it was, and they&#x27;d always want to come around and look at it.&quot; Josh Graves (Uncle Josh) further popularized the resonator steel guitar into Bluegrass music with Flatt and Scruggs to the extent that this type of lap steel became an established and familiar fixture in this genre. The dobro fell out of favor in mainstream country music until a bluegrass revival in the 1970s brought it back with younger virtuoso players like Jerry Douglas whose Dobro skills became widely known and emulated.

====Electrification====
In 1934, a steel guitarist named George Beauchamp invented the electric guitar pickup. He found that a vibrating metal string in a magnetic field generates a small current that can be amplified and sent to a loudspeaker; his steel guitar was the world&#x27;s first electric guitar. According to music writer Michael Ross, the first electrified stringed instrument on a commercial recording was a steel guitar played by Bob Dunn on a Western swing tune in 1935. Dunn recorded with Milton Brown and his Musical Brownies.

====Western swing====
In the early 1930s, the newly-electrified lap steel guitar was adopted by musicians type of dance music known as &quot;Western swing&quot;, a sub-genre of country music combined with jazz swing. The design of this instrument and the way it was played underwent continual change as the music of the genre evolved. In the 1930s, Leon McAuliffe advanced steel guitar technique while playing in the western swing band Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys. In October, 1936, McAuliffe recorded &quot;Steel Guitar Rag&quot; with Wills&#x27; band on a Rickenbacker B–6 lap steel with phenomenal record sales. Steel guitarists felt a need to change tunings for different voicings, so leading players added additional necks with different tunings on the same instrument. The added bulk meant that the instrument could no longer be managed on the player&#x27;s lap and required placement in a frame with legs and marketed as a &quot;console&quot; steel guitar. Prominent layers of that era, including Herb Remington and Noel Boggs, added more necks and eventually played instruments with up to four different necks.

====Honky-tonk====
By the late 1940s, the steel guitar featured prominently in &quot;honky-tonk&quot; style of country music. Honky-tonk singers who used a lap steel guitar in their musical arrangements included Hank Williams, Lefty Frizzell and Webb Pierce. Most recordings of that era were made on a C6 neck (guitar tuned in a C6 chord), sometimes called a &quot;Texas tuning&quot;. Using tunings with sixths and ninths became common and identifiable with the steel guitar sound.

====Modern country music and pedal steel====
The original idea for adding pedals to a console guitar was simply to push a pedal and change the tuning of all the strings into a different tuning and thus obviate the need for an additional neck, but these early efforts were unsuccessful. Around 1948, Paul Bigsby, a motorcycle shop foreman, designed a pedal system. He put pedals on a rack between the two front legs of a console steel guitar to create the pedal steel guitar. The pedals operated a mechanical linkage to apply tension to raise the pitch of certain strings. In 1953, musician Bud Isaacs used Bigsby&#x27;s invention to change the pitch of only two of the strings, and was the first to push the pedal while notes were still sounding. When Isaacs first used the setup on the 1954 recording of Webb Pierce&#x27;s song called &quot;Slowly&quot;, he pushed the pedal while playing a chord, so certain notes could be heard bending up from below into the existing chord to harmonize with the other strings, creating a stunning effect which had not been possible with on a lap steel. It was the birth of a new sound that was particularly embraced by fans of country and western music, and it caused a virtual revolution among steel players who wanted to duplicate it. Almost simultaneously, an entire musical subculture took a radical stylistic tack. Even though pedal steel guitars had been available for over a decade before this recording, the instrument emerged as a crucial element in country music after the success of this song. When the lap steel was thus superseded by the pedal steel, the inherent Hawaiian influence was brought into the new sound of country music emerging in Nashville in the 1950s. This sound became associated with American country music for the ensuing several decades.

===Gospel music===
In the United States in the 1930s, the steel guitar was introduced into religious music, a tradition called &quot;Sacred Steel&quot;. The congregation of the House of God, a branch of an African-American Pentecostal denomination, based primarily in Nashville and Indianapolis, embraced the lap steel guitar. The steel guitar often took the place of an organ and its sound bore no resemblance to typical American country music.

Darick Campbell (1966–2020) was a lap steel player for the gospel band, the Campbell Brothers, who took the musical tradition from the church to international fame. Campbell played an electric Hawaiian lap steel: a Fender Stringmaster 8-string (Fender Deluxe-8). Campbell was skilled at mimicking the human singing voice with his guitar. The idea of Campbell&#x27;s recordings with the Allman Brothers and other Blues and Rock artists was not well-received by church leaders.

In the 1980s, a minister&#x27;s son named Robert Randolph took up the pedal steel as a teenager, popularized it in this genre and received critical acclaim as a musician. Neil Strauss, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, called Randolph &quot;one of the most original and talented pedal steel guitarists of his generation&quot;.

===Other world music===
====Indian music====
The steel guitar&#x27;s popularity in India began with a Hawaiian immigrant who settled in Calcutta in the 1940s named Tau Moe (pronounced mo-ay). Moe taught Hawaiian guitar style and made steel guitars, and helped popularize the instrument in India. By the 1960s, the steel had become a common instrument in Indian popular music—later included in film soundtracks. Indian musicians typically play the lap steel while sitting on the floor and have modified the instrument by using, for example, three melody strings (played with steel bar and finger picks), four plucked drone strings, and 12 sympathetic strings to buzz like a sitar. Performing in this manner, the Indian musician Brij Bhushan Kabra adapted the steel guitar to play &quot;ragas&quot;, traditional Indian compositions and is called the father of the genre of Hindustani Slide Guitar.

====Māori music====
The Māori in the 1920s readily adopted the instrument following their fascination with musicians like Ernest Kaʻai and David Luela Kaili travelling across New Zealand, fascinated of their informed similar ancestry while also receiving very positively of their performances. Eruera Hita (or stagename &quot;Mati Hita&quot;) was the pioneer of the instrument among New Zealanders.

==Lap steel guitars==
Early lap steel guitars were traditional guitars tuned to a chord and modified by raising the strings away from the frets. After the electric pickup was invented, lap steels no longer needed any resonant chamber, thus newer designs began to resemble the traditional guitar shape less and less. These instruments were played resting across musicians&#x27; knees. George Beauchamp&#x27;s invention, which he nicknamed the &quot;Frying Pan&quot;, was officially called the &quot;Rickenbacker Electro A–22&quot;, an electric lap steel guitar produced from 1931 to 1939. It was the first electric stringed instrument of any kind and was the first electric stringed instrument to be heard on a commercial recording. Steel players, including Noel Boggs and Alvino Rey, immediately embraced the new instrument.

The Dobro is a type of acoustic lap steel with a resonator; the word is commonly used as a generic term to describe bluegrass resonator lap steels of any brand. Bluegrass dobro players often use a &quot;Stevens bar&quot; which has a deep groove in it to allow the steel to be grasped more firmly so it can be lifted and angled vertically downward slightly for playing single notes. The technique also allows for hammer-on or pull-off notes when there is an adjacent open string. Dobro players often slant the bar horizontally when playing to change an interval between two or more notes played simultaneously on different strings.

==Console steel guitars==
The console steel is any type electric steel guitar that rests on legs in a frame and is designed to be played in a seated position. The console steel usually has multiple necks—up to a maximum of four—each tuned differently. In the evolution of the steel guitar, the console steel is intermediate between the lap steel and the pedal steel.

==Pedal steel guitars==

The pedal steel guitar is an electric console instrument with one or two necks, each typically with ten strings. The neck tuned to C6 (Texas tuning) is closer to the player and the E9 (Nashville tuning) neck is further from the player. It may have up to ten pedals and a separate volume pedal, and up to eight knee levers are used to alter the tuning of various strings, allowing more varied and complex music than any other steel guitar. As an example, use of the pedals and knee levers in various combinations allows the player to play a major scale without moving the bar. The invention of the instrument was set in motion by the need to play more interesting and varied music that was not possible on previous steel guitars and to obviate the need for additional necks on console steels.

==Steels and slides==
A &quot;steel&quot; is a hard, smooth object pressed against guitar strings and is the reason for the name &quot;steel guitar&quot;. It may go by many names, including &quot;steel&quot;, &quot;tone bar&quot;, &quot;slide&quot;, &quot;bottleneck&quot; and others. A cylindrical-shaped steel with a bullet-shape on one end is typical in console steel and pedal steel playing. Lap steel and Dobro players often use a steel bar with squared-off ends and a deep groove for firmer grip. It has a cross section that resembles a railroad track. Another type of steel is a tubular object around a finger then referred to as a &quot;slide&quot;; that style of playing is called &quot;slide guitar&quot;.

<doc id="27616" wikidata="Q6582994" url="?curid=27616" title="Sunspot">
<text>Sunspots are temporary spots on the Sun&#x27;s surface that are darker than the surrounding area. They are one of the most recognizable Solar phenomena and despite the fact that they are mostly visible in the solar photosphere they usually affect the entire solar atmosphere. They are regions of reduced surface temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic flux that inhibit convection. Sunspots appear within active regions, usually in pairs of opposite magnetic polarity. Their number varies according to the approximately 11-year solar cycle.

Individual sunspots or groups of sunspots may last anywhere from a few days to a few months, but eventually decay. Sunspots expand and contract as they move across the surface of the Sun, with diameters ranging from to . Larger sunspots can be visible from Earth without the aid of a telescope. They may travel at relative speeds, or proper motions, of a few hundred meters per second when they first emerge.

Indicating intense magnetic activity, sunspots accompany other active region phenomena such as coronal loops, prominences, and reconnection events. Most solar flares and coronal mass ejections originate in these magnetically active regions around visible sunspot groupings. Similar phenomena indirectly observed on stars other than the Sun are commonly called starspots, and both light and dark spots have been measured.

== History ==

The earliest record of sunspots is found in the Chinese &quot;I Ching&quot;, completed before 800 BC. The text describes that a &quot;dou&quot; and &quot;mei&quot; were observed in the sun, where both words refer to a small obscuration. The earliest record of a deliberate sunspot observation also comes from China, and dates to 364 BC, based on comments by astronomer Gan De (甘德) in a star catalogue. By 28 BC, Chinese astronomers were regularly recording sunspot observations in official imperial records.

The first clear mention of a sunspot in Western literature is circa 300 BC, by ancient Greek scholar Theophrastus, student of Plato and Aristotle and successor to the latter.

The earliest known drawings of sunspots were made by English monk John of Worcester in December 1128.

Sunspots were first observed telescopically in December 1610 by English astronomer Thomas Harriot. His observations were recorded in his notebooks and were followed in March 1611 by observations and reports by Frisian astronomers Johannes and David Fabricius. After Johannes Fabricius&#x27; death at the age of 29, his reports remained obscure and were overshadowed by the independent discoveries of and publications about sunspots by Christoph Scheiner and Galileo Galilei. Galileo likely began telescopic sunspot observations around the same time as Harriot; however, Galileo&#x27;s records did not start until 1612. During the next decades numerous astronomers of that era participated in the pursuit of sunspots. One of these was the famous astronomer Johannes Hevelius who recorded 19 sunspot groups during the period of the early Maunder Minimum (1653-1679) in the book Machina Coelestis.

In the early 19th Century, William Herschel was one of the first to hypothesize a connection of sunspots with temperatures on Earth and believed that certain features of sunspots would indicate increased heating on Earth. During his recognition of solar behavior and hypothesized solar structure, he inadvertently picked up the relative absence of sunspots from July 1795 to January 1800 and was perhaps the first to construct a past record of observed or missing sunspots. From this he found that the absence of sunspots coincided with high wheat prices in England. The president of the Royal Society commented that the upward trend in wheat prices was due to monetary inflation. Years later scientists such as Richard Carrington in 1865 and John Henry Poynting in 1884 tried and failed to find a connection between wheat prices and sunspots, and modern analysis finds that there is no statistically significant correlation between wheat prices and sunspot numbers.

== Physics ==
=== Morphology ===

Sunspots have two main structures: a central and a surrounding . The umbra is the darkest region of a sunspot and is where the magnetic field is strongest and approximately vertical, or normal, to the Sun&#x27;s surface, or photosphere. The umbra may be surrounded completely or only partially by a brighter region known as the penumbra. The penumbra is composed of radially elongated structures known as penumbral filaments and has a more inclined magnetic field than the umbra. Within sunspot groups, multiple umbrae may be surrounded by a single, continuous penumbra.

The temperature of the umbra is roughly 3000–4500 K, in contrast to the surrounding material at about 5780 K, leaving sunspots clearly visible as dark spots. This is because the luminance of a heated black body (closely approximated by the photosphere) at these temperatures varies greatly with temperature. Isolated from the surrounding photosphere, a single sunspot would shine brighter than the full moon, with a crimson-orange color.

In some forming and decaying sunspots, relatively narrow regions of bright material appear penetrating into or completely dividing an umbra. These formations, referred to as light bridges, have been found to have a weaker, more tilted magnetic field compared to the umbra at the same height in the photosphere. Higher in the photosphere, the light bridge magnetic field merges and becomes comparable to that of the umbra. Gas pressure in light bridges has also been found to dominate over magnetic pressure, and convective motions have been detected.

The Wilson effect implies that sunspots are depressions on the Sun&#x27;s surface.

The appearance of an individual sunspot may last anywhere from a few days to a few months, though groups of sunspots and their associated active regions tend to last weeks or months. Sunspots expand and contract as they move across the surface of the Sun, with diameters ranging from to .

==== Formation ====
Although the details of sunspot formation are still a matter of ongoing research, it is widely understood that they are the visible manifestations of magnetic flux tubes in the Sun&#x27;s convective zone projecting through the photosphere within active regions. Their characteristic darkening occurs due to this strong magnetic field inhibiting convection in the photosphere. As a result, the energy flux from the Sun&#x27;s interior decreases, and with it, surface temperature, causing the surface area through which the magnetic field passes to look dark against the bright background of photospheric granules.

Sunspots initially appear in the photosphere as small darkened spots lacking a penumbra. These structures are known as solar pores. Over time, these pores increase in size and move towards one another. When a pore gets large enough, typically around in diameter, a penumbra will begin to form.

==== Decay ====
Magnetic pressure should tend to remove field concentrations, causing the sunspots to disperse, but sunspot lifetimes are measured in days to weeks. In 2001, observations from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) using sound waves traveling below the photosphere (local helioseismology) were used to develop a three-dimensional image of the internal structure below sunspots; these observations show that a powerful downdraft lies beneath each sunspot, forms a rotating vortex that sustains the concentrated magnetic field.

=== Solar cycle ===


Solar cycles last typically about eleven years, varying from just under 10 to just over 12 years. Over the solar cycle, sunspot populations increase quickly and then decrease more slowly. The point of highest sunspot activity during a cycle is known as solar maximum, and the point of lowest activity as solar minimum. This period is also observed in most other solar activity and is linked to a variation in the solar magnetic field that changes polarity with this period.

Early in the cycle, sunspots appear at higher latitudes and then move towards the equator as the cycle approaches maximum, following Spörer&#x27;s law. Spots from two sequential cycles co-exist for several years during the years near solar minimum. Spots from sequential cycles can be distinguished by direction of their magnetic field and their latitude.

The Wolf number sunspot index counts the average number of sunspots and groups of sunspots during specific intervals. The 11-year solar cycles are numbered sequentially, starting with the observations made in the 1750s.

George Ellery Hale first linked magnetic fields and sunspots in 1908.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1086/141602&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hale suggested that the sunspot cycle period is 22 years, covering two periods of increased and decreased sunspot numbers, accompanied by polar reversals of the solar magnetic dipole field. Horace W. Babcock later proposed a qualitative model for the dynamics of the solar outer layers. The Babcock Model explains that magnetic fields cause the behavior described by Spörer&#x27;s law, as well as other effects, which are twisted by the Sun&#x27;s rotation.

=== Longer-period trends ===
Sunspot numbers also change over long periods. For example, during the period known as the modern maximum from 1900 to 1958 the solar maxima trend of sunspot count was upwards; for the following 60 years the trend was mostly downwards. Overall, the Sun was last as active as the modern maximum over 8,000 years ago.

Sunspot number is correlated with the intensity of solar radiation over the period since 1979, when satellite measurements became available. The variation caused by the sunspot cycle to solar output is on the order of 0.1% of the solar constant (a peak-to-trough range of 1.3 W·m−2 compared with 1366 W·m−2 for the average solar constant).


== Modern observation ==

Sunspots are observed with land-based and Earth-orbiting solar telescopes. These telescopes use filtration and projection techniques for direct observation, in addition to various types of filtered cameras. Specialized tools such as spectroscopes and spectrohelioscopes are used to examine sunspots and sunspot areas. Artificial eclipses allow viewing of the circumference of the Sun as sunspots rotate through the horizon.

Since looking directly at the Sun with the naked eye permanently damages human vision, amateur observation of sunspots is generally conducted using projected images, or directly through protective filters. Small sections of very dark filter glass, such as a #14 welder&#x27;s glass, are effective. A telescope eyepiece can project the image, without filtration, onto a white screen where it can be viewed indirectly, and even traced, to follow sunspot evolution. Special purpose hydrogen-alpha narrow bandpass filters and aluminum-coated glass attenuation filters (which have the appearance of mirrors due to their extremely high optical density) on the front of a telescope provide safe observation through the eyepiece.

== Application ==
Due to their correlation with other kinds of solar activity, sunspots can be used to help predict space weather, the state of the ionosphere, and conditions relevant to short-wave radio propagation or satellite communications. High sunspot activity is celebrated by members of the amateur radio community as a harbinger of excellent ionospheric propagation conditions that greatly increase radio range in the HF bands. During peaks in sunspot activity, worldwide radio communication can be achieved on frequencies as high as the 6-meter VHF band.

Solar activity (and the solar cycle) have been implicated as a factor in global warming. The first possible example of this is the Maunder Minimum period of low sunspot activity which occurred during the Little Ice Age in Europe. However, detailed studies from multiple paleoclimate indicators show that the lower northern hemisphere temperatures in the Little Ice Age began while sunspot numbers were still high before the start of the Maunder Minimum, and persisted until after the Maunder Minimum had ceased. Numerical climate modelling indicates that volcanic activity was the main driver of the Little Ice Age.

Sunspots themselves, in terms of the magnitude of their radiant-energy deficit, have a weak effect on solar flux. The total effect of sunspots and other magnetic processes in the solar photosphere is an increase of roughly 0.1% in brightness of the Sun in comparison with its brightness at the solar-minimum level. This is a difference in total solar irradiance at Earth over the sunspot cycle of close to formula_1. Other magnetic phenomena which correlate with sunspot activity include faculae and the chromospheric network. The combination of these magnetic factors mean that the relationship of sunspot numbers to Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) over the decadal-scale solar cycle, and their relationship for century timescales, need not be the same. The main problem with quantifying the longer-term trends in TSI lies in the stability of the absolute radiometry measurements made from space, which has improved in recent decades but remains a problem. Analysis shows that it is possible that TSI was actually higher in the Maunder Minimum compared to present-day levels, but uncertainties are high, with best estimates in the range formula_2 with a formula_3 uncertainty range of formula_4.

Sunspots, with their intense magnetic field concentrations, facilitate the complex transfer of energy and momentum to the upper solar atmosphere. This transfer occurs through a variety of mechanisms, including generated waves in the lower solar atmosphere and magnetic reconnection events.

== Starspot ==

In 1947, G. E. Kron proposed that starspots were the reason for periodic changes in brightness on red dwarfs. Since the mid-1990s, starspot observations have been made using increasingly powerful techniques yielding more and more detail: photometry showed starspot growth and decay and showed cyclic behavior similar to the Sun&#x27;s; spectroscopy examined the structure of starspot regions by analyzing variations in spectral line splitting due to the Zeeman effect; Doppler imaging showed differential rotation of spots for several stars and distributions different from the Sun&#x27;s; spectral line analysis measured the temperature range of spots and the stellar surfaces. For example, in 1999, Strassmeier reported the largest cool starspot ever seen rotating the giant K0 star XX Trianguli (HD 12545) with a temperature of , together with a warm spot of .

<doc id="27619" wikidata="Q1460" url="?curid=27619" title="Sicily">
<text>Sicily (, ; , ), officially the Sicilian Region (), is an island in the central Mediterranean Sea, south of the Italian Peninsula in continental Europe and is one of the 20 regions of Italy. With 4.8 million inhabitants, including 1.3 million in and around the capital city of Palermo, it is both the largest and most populous island in the Mediterranean Sea. Sicily is named after the Sicels, who inhabited the eastern part of the island during the Iron Age. Sicily has a rich and unique culture in arts, music, literature, cuisine, and architecture. Its most prominent landmark is Mount Etna, the tallest active volcano in Europe, and one of the most active in the world, currently high. The island has a typical Mediterranean climate. It is separated from Calabria by the Strait of Messina. It is one of the five Italian autonomous regions and is generally considered part of Southern Italy.

The earliest archaeological record of human activity on the island is from around 14,000 BC. By around 750 BC, Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies along its coasts, becoming one of the centers of Magna Graecia. The Sicilian Wars of 580–265 BC were fought between the Carthaginians and Greeks, and the Punic Wars of 264–146 BC were fought between Rome and Carthage. The Roman province of Sicilia ended with the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. Sicily was ruled during the Early Middle Ages by the Vandals, the Ostrogoths, the Byzantine Empire, and the Emirate of Sicily.

The Norman conquest of southern Italy led to the creation of the County of Sicily in 1071, that was succeeded by Kingdom of Sicily, a state that existed from 1130 until 1816 under various dynasties, and in 1816 it was unified with the Kingdom of Naples into the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. From the 1282 Sicilian Vespers until the 1860 Expedition of the Thousand, Sicily was ruled by Aragon and then Spain, either in personal union with the crown or by a cadet branch, with the exception of a period of Savoy and then Habsburg rule in 1713–1735.

The island became part of the newly unified Italy in 1860 following the Expedition of the Thousand, an invasion led by Giuseppe Garibaldi, and a plebiscite. Sicily was given special status as an autonomous administrative division on 15 May 1946, 18 days before the 1946 Italian institutional referendum.

==Geography==

Sicily has a roughly triangular shape, earning it the name &quot;Trinacria&quot;.

To the north-east, it is separated from Calabria and the rest of the Italian mainland by the Strait of Messina, about wide in the north, and about wide in the southern part. The northern and southern coasts are each about long measured as a straight line, while the eastern coast measures around ; total coast length is estimated at . The total area of the island is , while the Autonomous Region of Sicily (which includes the smaller surrounding islands of Lipari, Egadi, Ustica, and Pantelleria) has an area of .

The terrain of inland Sicily is mostly hilly and is intensively cultivated wherever possible. Along the northern coast, the mountain ranges of Madonie, , Nebrodi, , and Peloritani, , are an extension of the mainland Apennines. The cone of Mount Etna dominates the eastern coast. In the southeast lie the lower Hyblaean Mountains, . The mines of the Enna and Caltanissetta districts were part of a leading sulphur-producing area throughout the 19th century, but have declined since the 1950s.

Sicily and its surrounding small islands have some highly active volcanoes. This is due to Sicily being geographically on the northern edge of the African Plate. Mount Etna is the largest active volcano in Europe and casts black ash over the island with its recurrent eruptions. It stands high as of September 2024. It is the highest mountain in Italy south of the Alps. Etna covers an area of with a basal circumference of . This makes it the largest of the three active volcanoes in Italy, being about two and a half times the height of the next largest, Mount Vesuvius. In Greek mythology, the deadly monster Typhon was trapped under the mountain by Zeus, the god of the sky. Mount Etna is widely regarded as a cultural symbol and icon of Sicily.

The Aeolian Islands in the Tyrrhenian Sea, to the northeast of mainland Sicily form a volcanic complex.

The three volcanoes of Vulcano, Stromboli and Lipari are also active, although the last is usually dormant. Off the southern coast of Sicily, the underwater volcano of Ferdinandea, which is part of the larger Empedocles volcano, last erupted in 1831. It is located between the coast of Agrigento and the island of Pantelleria (which itself is a dormant volcano).

From a geographical perspective, also forming a part of Sicily is the Maltese Archipelago, the islands home to the republic of Malta.

The autonomous region also includes several neighbouring islands: the Aegadian Islands, the Aeolian Islands, Pantelleria and Lampedusa.

=== Mountains ===

The mountains of Sicily form a significant part of the island&#x27;s diverse landscape, with Mount Etna, one of the world&#x27;s most active volcanoes, being the highest and most notable peak. Other important mountain ranges include the Nebrodi, Madonie and Peloritani mountains ranges.

===Rivers===
Several rivers drain the island, most of which flow through the central area and enter the sea at the south of the island. The Salso flows through parts of Enna and Caltanissetta before entering the Mediterranean Sea at the port of Licata. To the east, the Alcantara flows through the province of Messina and enters the sea at Giardini Naxos, and the Simeto, which flows into the Ionian Sea south of Catania. Other important rivers on the island are the Belice and Platani in the southwest.

===Climate===
Sicily has for the most part a typical Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;) with mild and wet winters and hot, dry summers with changeable intermediate seasons. On the coasts, especially in the southwest, the climate is affected by the African currents and summers can be hot.

Snow falls above 900 metres, but it can fall in the hills. The interior mountains, especially Nebrodi, Madonie, and Etna, enjoy a mountain climate, with heavy snowfalls during winter. The summit of Mount Etna is usually snow-capped from October to May.

In the summer, the sirocco – the wind from the Sahara – can be felt. Rainfall is scarce, and in some provinces a water crisis can occur.

According to the Regional Agency for Waste and Water, on 10 August 1999, the weather station of Catenanuova (EN) recorded an unofficial maximum temperature of . On 11 August 2021, a new highest temperature record for Europe with a reading of was set near the city of Syracuse. Total precipitation is highly variable, generally increasing with elevation. In general, the southern and southeast coast receives the least rainfall (less than ), and the northern and northeastern highlands the most (over ).

===Flora and fauna===

Sicily is an often-quoted example of man-made deforestation, which has occurred since Roman times when the island was turned into an agricultural region. This gradually dried the climate, leading to a decline in rainfall and the drying of rivers. The central and southwest provinces are practically devoid of forest. In Northern Sicily, there are three important forests; near Mount Etna, in the Nebrodi Mountains and in the Bosco della Ficuzza Natural Reserve near Palermo. The Nebrodi Mountains Regional Park, established on 4 August 1993 and covering , is the largest protected natural area of Sicily; it contains the largest forest in Sicily, the Caronia. The Hundred Horse Chestnut (), in Sant&#x27;Alfio, on the eastern slopes of Mount Etna, is the largest and oldest known chestnut tree in the world at 2,000–4,000 years old.

Sicily has a wide variety of fauna. Species include the European wildcat, red fox, least weasel, pine marten, fallow deer, wild boar, crested porcupine, European hedgehog, common toad, &quot;Vipera aspis&quot;, golden eagle, peregrine falcon, Eurasian hoopoe and black-winged stilt. Roe deer were driven to extinction on the island. The Sicilian wolf (&quot;Canis lupus cristaldii&quot;) was an endemic wolf subspecies that was driven to extinction in the 20th century. During the Late Pleistocene, a species of dwarf elephant, Palaeoloxodon mnaidriensis inhabited the island, with its latest records on Sicily dating to around 20,000 years ago.

The Riserva naturale dello Zingaro (Zingaro Natural Reserve) is one of the best examples of unspoiled coastal wilderness in Sicily.

Marine Life of the Straits of Messina includes varieties of birds and marine life, including larger species such as greater flamingo and fin whale.

== History ==
The name &quot;Sicilia&quot; was given to the Roman province in 241 BC. It is named after the Sicels, who inhabited the eastern part of the island during the Iron Age. The ancient name of the island is &quot;Trinacria&quot; (Greek Τρινακρία &quot;having three headlands&quot;) for its triangular shape, likely a re-interpretation of earlier (Homeric) &quot;Thrinacia&quot;. The Greek name was rendered as &quot;Trīnācrĭa&quot; in classical Latin (Virgil, Ovid).

===Prehistory===
Humans first colonized Sicily towards the end of the Late Pleistocene, around 16,000 years ago, by people associated with the Epigravettian culture.

Discoveries of dolmens on the island (dating to the second half of the third millennium BC) seem to offer new insights into the culture of primitive Sicily. The impact of at least two influences is clear: the European one coming from the Northwest, and the Mediterranean influence of an eastern heritage.

===Antiquity===

 

The original classical-era inhabitants of Sicily comprised three defined groups of the ancient peoples of Italy: the Sicani, the Elymians and the Sicels. The most prominent and by far the earliest of these were the Sicani, who (Thucydides writes) arrived from the Iberian Peninsula (perhaps Catalonia). Some modern scholars, however, suggest classifying the Sicani as possibly an Illyrian tribe. Important historical evidence has been discovered in the form of cave drawings by the Sicani, dated from the end of the Pleistocene epoch around 8000 BC. The Elymians, thought to have come from the area of the Aegean Sea, became the next tribe to join the Sicanians on Sicily.

No evidence survives of warring between tribes, but the Sicanians moved eastwards when the Elymians settled in the northwest corner of the island. The Sicels are thought to have originated in Liguria; they arrived from mainland Italy in 1200 BC and forced the Sicanians to move back across Sicily and to settle in the middle of the island. Other minor Italic groups who settled in Sicily included the Ausones (Aeolian Islands, Milazzo) and the Morgetes of Morgantina.

The Phoenician settlements in the western part of the island predate the arrival of Greek colonists. From about 750 BC, the Greeks began to live in Sicily ( – &quot;Sikelia&quot;), establishing many significant settlements. The most important colony was in Syracuse; others grew up at Akragas, Selinunte, Gela, Himera and Zancle. The native Sicani and Sicel peoples became absorbed into the Hellenic culture with relative ease, and the area became part of Magna Graecia along with the coasts of the south of the Italian peninsula, which the Greeks had also colonised. Sicily had fertile soils, and the successful introduction of olives and grape vines fostered profitable trading. Greek culture significantly centered around Greek religion, and the settlers built many temples throughout Sicily, including several in the &quot;Valley of the Temples&quot; at Agrigento.

Politics on the island became intertwined with those of Greece; Syracuse became desired by the Athenians who set out on the Sicilian Expedition (415–413 BC) during the Peloponnesian War. Syracuse gained Sparta and Corinth as allies and, as a result, defeated the Athenian expedition. The victors destroyed the Athenian army and their ships, selling most of the survivors into slavery.

The Greek kingdom of Syracuse controlled most of eastern Sicily while Carthage controlled the western side. The two cultures began to clash, leading to the Greek-Punic wars (between 580 and 265 BC). The Greek states had begun to make peace with the Roman Republic in 262 BC, before the Romans sought to annex Sicily as their republic&#x27;s first province. Rome attacked Carthage&#x27;s holdings in Sicily in the First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) and won, making Sicily–with the exception of Syracuse–the first Roman province outside of the Italian Peninsula by 242 BC.

In the Second Punic War (218 to 201 BC), the Carthaginians attempted to recapture Sicily. Some of the Greek cities on the island who were loyal to Rome switched sides to help the Carthaginians, prompting a Roman military response. Archimedes, who lived in Syracuse, helped defend his city from Roman invasion; Roman troops killed him after they captured Syracuse in 212 BC. The Carthaginian attempt failed, and Rome became more unrelenting in its annihilation of the invaders; Roman consul M. Valerian told the Roman Senate in 210 BC that &quot;no Carthaginian remains in Sicily&quot;.

As the Roman Republic&#x27;s granary, Sicily ranked as an important province, divided into two quaestorships: Syracuse to the east and Lilybaeum to the west. Roman rule introduced the Latin language to the island, which underwent a slow process of latinisation but Sicilian culture remained largely Greek and the Greek language did not become extinct on the island, facilitating its re-hellenisation much later under the Byzantines. The prosperity of the island went into sharp decline during the governorship of Verres (73 to 71 BC). In 70 BC, the noted statesman Cicero condemned the misgovernment of Verres in his oration &quot;In Verrem&quot;.

Various groups used the island as a power base at different times: slave insurgents occupied it during the First (135−132 BC) and Second (104−100 BC) Servile Wars. Sextus Pompey had his headquarters there during the Sicilian revolt of 44 to 36 BC. Christianity first appeared in Sicily during the years following AD 200; between this time and AD 313, when Emperor Constantine the Great lifted the prohibition on Christianity, a significant number of Sicilians had become martyrs, including Agatha, Christina, Lucy, and Euplius. Christianity grew rapidly in Sicily over the next two centuries. Sicily remained a Roman province for around 700 years.

=== Germanic rule (469–535) ===
The Western Roman Empire began falling apart after the invasion of Vandals, Alans, and Sueves across the Rhine on the last day of 406. Eventually the Vandals, after roaming about western and southern Hispania (present-day Iberia) for 20 years, moved to North Africa in 429 and occupied Carthage in 439. The Franks moved south from present-day Belgium. The Visigoths moved west and eventually settled in Aquitaine in 418; the Burgundians settled in present-day Savoy in 443.

The Vandals found themselves in a position to threaten Sicily – only 100 miles away from their North African bases. After taking Carthage, the Vandals, personally led by King Gaiseric, laid siege to Palermo in 440 as the opening act in an attempt to wrest the island from Roman rule. The Vandals made another attempt to take the island one year after the 455 sack of Rome, at Agrigento, but were defeated decisively by Ricimir in a naval victory off Corsica in 456. The island remained under Roman rule until 469. The Vandals lost possession of the island 8 years later in 477 to the East Germanic tribe of the Ostrogoths, who then controlled Italy and Dalmatia. The island was returned to the Ostrogoths by payment of tribute to their king Odoacer. He ruled Italy from 476 to 488 in the name of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Emperor. The Vandals kept a toehold in Lilybaeum, a port on the west coast. They lost this in 491 after making one last attempt to conquer the island from this port. The Ostrogothic conquest of Sicily (and of Italy as a whole) under Theodoric the Great began in 488. The Byzantine Emperor Zeno had appointed Theodoric as a military commander in Italy. The Goths were Germanic, but Theodoric fostered Roman culture and government and allowed freedom of religion. In 461 from the age of seven or eight until 17 or 18 Theodoric had become a Byzantine hostage; he resided in the great palace of Constantinople, was favored by Emperor Leo I () and learned to read, write and do arithmetic.

===Byzantine period (535–827)===


After taking areas occupied by the Vandals in North Africa, Justinian I retook Italy as an ambitious attempt to recover the lost provinces in the West. The re-conquests marked an end to over 150 years of accommodating policies with tribal invaders. His first target was Sicily, leading to the Gothic War (535–554) between the Ostrogoths and the Eastern Roman Empire, also known as the Byzantine Empire. Justinian&#x27;s general Belisarius was assigned to the military task. Sicily was used as a base for the Byzantines to conquer the rest of Italy, including Naples, Rome, and Milan. It took five years before the Ostrogoth capital Ravenna fell in 540. However, the new Ostrogoth king Totila counterattacked, moving down the Italian peninsula, plundering and conquering Sicily in 550. Totila was defeated and killed in the Battle of Taginae by Byzantine general Narses in 552 but Italy was in ruins.

At the time of the reconquest Greek was still the predominant language spoken on the island. Sicily was invaded by the Arab forces of Caliph Uthman in 652, but the Arabs failed to make permanent gains. They returned to Syria with their booty. Raids seeking loot continued until the mid-8th century.

The Eastern Roman Emperor Constans II moved from Constantinople to Syracuse in 660. The following year he launched an assault from Sicily against the Lombard Duchy of Benevento, which occupied most of southern Italy. Rumors that the capital of the empire was to be moved to Syracuse probably cost Constans his life, as he was assassinated in 668. His son Constantine IV succeeded him. A brief usurpation in Sicily by Mezezius was quickly suppressed by this emperor. Contemporary accounts report that the Greek language was widely spoken on the island during this period. In 740 Emperor Leo III the Isaurian transferred Sicily from the jurisdiction of the church of Rome to that of Constantinople, placing the island within the eastern branch of the Church.

In 826 Euphemius, the Byzantine commander in Sicily, having apparently killed his wife, forced a nun to marry him. Emperor Michael II caught wind of the matter and ordered general Constantine to end the marriage and cut off Euphemius&#x27; head. Euphemius rose up, killed Constantine, and then occupied Syracuse; he, in turn, was defeated and driven out to North Africa. He offered the rule of Sicily to Ziyadat Allah, the Aghlabid Emir of Tunisia, in return for a position as a general and a place of safety. A Muslim army was then sent to the island consisting of Arabs, Berbers, Cretans, and Persians.

The Muslim conquest of Sicily was a see-saw affair and met with fierce resistance. It took over a century for Byzantine Sicily to be conquered; the largest city, Syracuse, held out until 878 and the Greek city of Taormina fell in 962. It was not until 965 that all of Sicily was conquered by the Arabs. In the 11th-century Byzantine armies carried out a partial reconquest of the island under George Maniakes, but it was their Norman mercenaries who would eventually complete the island&#x27;s reconquest at the end of the century.

===Arab period (827–1091)===

The language spoken in Sicily under Arab rule was Siculo-Arabic and Arabic influence is present in some Sicilian words today. Although long extinct in Sicily, the language has developed into what is now the Maltese language on the islands of Malta today.

A description of Palermo was given by Ibn Hawqal, an Arab merchant who visited Sicily in 950. A walled suburb, called the Al-Kasr (the palace), is the centre of Palermo to this day, with the great Friday mosque on the site of the later Roman cathedral. The suburb of al-Khalisa (modern Kalsa) contained the Sultan&#x27;s palace, baths, a mosque, government offices, and a private prison. Ibn Hawqal estimated there were 7,000 butchers trading in 150 shops. The Muslim rule introduced lemons, oranges and sugar cane, as well as cotton and mulberries for sericulture, and introduced the Qanat to improve irrigation systems for agriculture. Around 1050, the western half of Sicily was ethnically and culturally distinct from central and eastern Sicily. During this time, there was also a small Jewish presence in Sicily, evidence seen in the catacombs discovered on the island.

Palermo was initially ruled by the Aghlabids; later it was the centre of the Emirate of Sicily, which was under the nominal suzerainty of the Fatimid Caliphate. During the reign of this dynasty revolts by Byzantine Sicilians continuously occurred especially in the east where Greek-speaking Christians predominated. Parts of the island were re-occupied before revolts were quashed. Under the Arab rule the island was divided in three administrative regions, or &quot;vals&quot;, roughly corresponding to the three &quot;points&quot; of Sicily: Val di Mazara in the west; Val Demone in the northeast; and Val di Noto in the southeast. As dhimmis, that is as members of a protected class of approved monotheists, the Eastern Orthodox Christians were allowed freedom of religion, but had to pay a tax, the jizya (in lieu of the obligatory alms tax, the zakat, paid by Muslims), and were restricted from active participation in public affairs. By the 11th century, the Emirate of Sicily began to fragment as intra-dynastic quarreling fractured the Muslim government.

===Norman Sicily (1038–1198)===

In 1038, seventy years after losing their last cities in Sicily, the Byzantines under the Greek general George Maniakes invaded the island together with their Varangian and Norman mercenaries. Maniakes was killed in a Byzantine civil war in 1043 before completing a reconquest and the Byzantines withdrew. Later the Normans invaded in 1061 and after taking Apulia and Calabria, Roger I occupied Messina with an army of 700 knights. In 1068, Roger I was victorious at Misilmeri. Most crucial was the siege of Palermo, whose fall in 1071 eventually resulted in all Sicily coming under Norman control. The conquest was completed in 1091 when they captured Noto the last Arab stronghold. Palermo continued to be the capital under the Normans. The Normans formed a small but violent ruling class. They destroyed many of the Arab towns in Sicily, and very few physical remains survive from the Arab era.

The Norman Hauteville family appreciated and admired the rich and layered culture in which they now found themselves. They also introduced into Sicily their own culture, customs, and politics from Normandy. Many Normans in Sicily adopted the habits and comportment of Muslim rulers and their Byzantine subjects in dress, language, literature, even to the extent of having palace eunuchs and, according to some accounts, a harem.

While Roger I died in 1101, his wife Adelaide ruled until 1112 when their son Roger II of Sicily came of age. Having succeeded his brother Simon as Count of Sicily, Roger II was ultimately able to raise the status of the island to a kingdom in 1130, along with his other holdings, which included the Maltese Islands and the Duchies of Apulia and Calabria.

Roger II appointed the powerful Greek George of Antioch to be his &quot;emir of emirs&quot; and continued the syncretism of his father. During this period, the Kingdom of Sicily was prosperous and politically powerful, becoming one of the wealthiest states in all of Europe—even wealthier than the Kingdom of England.

The court of Roger II became the most luminous centre of culture in the Mediterranean, both from Europe and the Middle East, like the multi-ethnic Caliphate of Córdoba, then only just eclipsed. This attracted scholars, scientists, poets, artists, and artisans of all kinds. Laws were issued in the language of the community to whom they were addressed in Norman Sicily, at the time when the culture was still heavily Arab and Greek. Governance was by rule of law which promoted justice. Muslims, Jews, Byzantine Greeks, Lombards, and Normans worked together fairly amicably. During this time many extraordinary buildings were constructed.

However this situation changed as the Normans imported immigrants from Normandy, England, Lombardy, Piedmont, Provence and Campania to secure the island. Linguistically, the island shifted from being one-third Greek- and two-thirds Arabic-speaking at the time of the Norman conquest to becoming fully Latinised. In terms of religion the island became completely Roman Catholic (bearing in mind that until 1054 the Churches owing allegiance to the Pope and the Patriarch of Constantinople belonged to one Church); Sicily before the Norman conquest was under the Eastern Orthodox Patriarch. After Pope Innocent III made him Papal Legate in 1098, Roger I created several Catholic bishoprics while still allowing the construction of 12 Greek-speaking monasteries (the Greek language, monasteries, and 1500 parishes continued to exist until the adherents of the Greek Rite were forced in 1585 to convert to Catholicism or leave; a small pocket of Greek-speakers still live in Messina).

===Kingdom of Sicily (1198–1860)===


After a century, the Norman Hauteville dynasty died out; the last direct descendant and heir of Roger II, Constance, married Emperor Henry VI. This eventually led to the crown of Sicily being passed to the Hohenstaufen dynasty, who were Germans from Swabia. The last of the Hohenstaufens, Frederick II, the only son of Constance, was one of the greatest and most cultured men of the Middle Ages. His mother&#x27;s will had asked Pope Innocent III to undertake the guardianship of her son. Frederick was four when at Palermo, he was crowned King of Sicily in 1198. Frederick received no systematic education and was allowed to run free in the streets of Palermo. There he picked up the many languages he heard spoken, such as Arabic and Greek, and learned some of the lore of the Jewish community. At age twelve, he dismissed Innocent&#x27;s deputy regent and took over the government; at fifteen he married Constance of Aragon, and began his reclamation of the imperial crown. Subsequently, due to Muslim rebellions, Frederick II destroyed the remaining Muslim presence in Sicily, estimated at 60,000 people, moving all to the city of Lucera in Apulia between 1221 and 1226.

Conflict between the Hohenstaufen house and the Papacy led, in 1266, to Pope Innocent IV crowning the French prince Charles, count of Anjou and Provence, as the king of both Sicily and Naples.

Strong opposition to French officialdom due to mistreatment and taxation saw the local peoples of Sicily rise up, leading in 1282 to an insurrection known as the War of the Sicilian Vespers, which eventually saw almost the entire French population on the island killed. During the war, the Sicilians turned to Peter III of Aragon, son-in-law of the last Hohenstaufen king, for support after being rejected by the Pope. Peter gained control of Sicily from the French, who, however, retained control of the Kingdom of Naples. A crusade was launched in August 1283 against Peter III and the Crown of Aragon by Pope Martin IV (a pope from Île-de-France), but it failed. The wars continued until the peace of Caltabellotta in 1302, which saw Peter&#x27;s son Frederick III recognized as the king of the Isle of Sicily, while Charles II was recognized as the king of Naples by Pope Boniface VIII. Sicily was ruled as an independent kingdom by relatives of the kings of Aragon until 1409 and then as part of the Crown of Aragon.

In October 1347, in Messina, Sicily, the Black Death first arrived in Europe.

Between the 15th and 18th centuries, waves of Greeks from the Peloponnese (such as the Maniots) and Arvanites migrated to Sicily in large numbers to escape persecution after the Ottoman conquest of the Peloponnese. They brought with them Eastern Orthodoxy as well as the Greek and Arvanitika languages, once again adding onto the extensive Byzantine/Greek influence.

The onset of the Spanish Inquisition in 1492 led to Ferdinand II decreeing the expulsion of all Jews from Sicily. The eastern part of the island was hit by destructive earthquakes in 1542 and 1693. Just a few years before the latter earthquake, the island was struck by a plague. The earthquake in 1693 took an estimated 60,000 lives. There were revolts during the 17th century, but these were quelled with force, especially the revolts of Palermo and Messina. North African slave raids discouraged settlement along the coast until the 19th century. The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 saw Sicily assigned to the House of Savoy; however, this period of rule lasted only seven years, as it was exchanged for the island of Sardinia with Emperor Charles VI of the Austrian Habsburg Dynasty.

While the Austrians were concerned with the War of the Polish Succession, a Bourbon prince, Charles from Spain was able to conquer Sicily and Naples. At first Sicily was able to remain as an independent kingdom under personal union, while the Bourbons ruled over both from Naples. However, the advent of Napoleon&#x27;s First French Empire saw Naples taken at the Battle of Campo Tenese and Bonapartist King of Naples was installed. Ferdinand III, the Bourbon, was forced to retreat to Sicily which he was still in control of with the help of British naval protection.

Following this, Sicily joined the Napoleonic Wars, and subsequently the British under Lord William Bentinck established a military and diplomatic presence on the island to protect against a French invasion. Sicilian volunteers joined the British military to form the Royal Sicilian Regiment, which saw action at the Battle of Maida and then transferred to Iberia. After the wars were won, Sicily and Naples formally merged as the Two Sicilies under the Bourbons. Major revolutionary movements occurred in 1820 and 1848 against the Bourbon government with Sicily seeking independence; the second of which, the 1848 revolution resulted in a short period of independence for Sicily. However, in 1849 the Bourbons retook control of the island and dominated it until 1860.

===Italian unification===
The Expedition of the Thousand led by Giuseppe Garibaldi captured Sicily in 1860, as part of the . The conquest started at Marsala, and native Sicilians joined him in the capture of the southern Italian peninsula. Garibaldi&#x27;s march was completed with the siege of Gaeta, where the final Bourbons were expelled and Garibaldi announced his dictatorship in the name of Victor Emmanuel II of Kingdom of Sardinia. Sicily became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia after a referendum in which more than 75% of Sicily voted in favour of the annexation on 21 October 1860 (although not everyone was allowed to vote). As a result of the proclamation of the Kingdom of Italy, Sicily became part of the kingdom on 17 March 1861.

The Sicilian economy (and the wider &quot;mezzogiorno&quot; economy) remained relatively underdeveloped after the Italian unification, in spite of the strong investments made by the Kingdom of Italy in terms of modern infrastructure, and this caused an unprecedented wave of emigration. In 1894, organisations of workers and peasants known as the &quot;Fasci Siciliani&quot; protested against the bad social and economic conditions of the island, but they were suppressed in a few days.

This period was also characterized by the first contact between the Sicilian Mafia (the crime syndicate also known as Cosa Nostra) and the Italian government. The Mafia&#x27;s origins are still uncertain, but it is generally accepted that it emerged in the 18th century initially in the role of private enforcers hired to protect the property of landowners and merchants from the groups of &quot;briganti&quot; who frequently pillaged the countryside and towns. The battle against the Mafia made by the Kingdom of Italy was controversial and ambiguous. The Carabinieri (the military police of Italy) and sometimes the Royal Italian Army were often involved in fights against the mafia members, but their efforts were frequently useless because of the weakness of the Italian judicial system and cooperation between the mafia and local governments.

===20th and 21st centuries===
The Messina earthquake of 28 December 1908 killed more than 80,000 people.

In the 1920s, the Fascist regime began taking stronger military action, led by Cesare Mori (nicknamed the &quot;Iron Prefect&quot; for his iron-fisted campaigns), against the Sicilian Mafia, the first that ended with considerable success. There was an Allied invasion of Sicily during World War II starting on 10 July 1943. In preparation for the invasion, the Allies revitalised the Mafia to aid them. The invasion of Sicily contributed to the 25 July crisis; in general, the Allied victors were warmly embraced by Sicily.

In the aftermath of World War II, Italy became a Republic in 1946. Under the Constitution of Italy, Sicily is one of five regions with autonomy. Both the partial Italian land reform and special funding from the Italian government&#x27;s &quot;Cassa per il Mezzogiorno&quot; (Fund for the South) from 1950 to 1984 helped the Sicilian economy. During this period, the economic and social condition of the island was generally improved due to investments in infrastructure (such as motorways and airports) and the creation of industrial and commercial areas. In the 1980s, the Mafia was weakened by another campaign led by magistrates Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino. Between 1990 and 2005, the unemployment rate fell from about 23% to 11%.

The Cosa Nostra has traditionally been the most powerful group in Sicily, especially around Palermo. A police investigation in summer 2019 also confirmed strong links between the Palermo area Sicilian Mafia and American organized crime, particularly the Gambino crime family. According to &quot;La Repubblica&quot;, &quot;Off they go, through the streets of Passo di Rigano, Boccadifalco, Torretta and at the same time, Brooklyn, Staten Island, [and] New Jersey. Because from Sicily to the US, the old mafia has returned.&quot;

==Demographics==


As of 2024, 4.75 million people live in Sicily, making it the fourth most populated region in Italy. In the first century after the Italian unification, Sicily had one of the most negative net migration rates among the regions of Italy because of the emigration of millions of people to Northern Italy, other European countries, North America, South America and Australia. Like the South of Italy and Sardinia, immigration to the island is very low compared to other regions of Italy because workers tend to head to Northern Italy instead, due to better employment and industrial opportunities. According to ISTAT figures from 2017, show around 175,000 immigrants out of the total 5,029,615 population; Romanians with more than 50,000 make up the most immigrants, followed by Tunisians, Moroccans, Sri Lankans, Albanians, and others mostly from Eastern Europe. As of 31 December 2020, there were 186,195 foreigners resident in the region.
As in the rest of Italy, the official language is Italian and the primary religion is Roman Catholicism.

===Emigration===

Sicilian emigration started shortly after the Italian unification and has not stopped ever since.

The aforementioned factors, along with a failed land reform, resulted in a never-before-seen wave of Sicilians emigrating, first to the United States between the 1880s and the 1920s, later to Northern Italy, and from the 1960s onwards also to Belgium, France, Germany, Switzerland, as well as Australia and South America.

Today, Sicily is the Italian region with the highest number of expatriates: as of 2017, 750,000 Sicilians, 14.4% of the island&#x27;s population, lived abroad. The trend of young Sicilians leaving the island in search of employment elsewhere in Italy and abroad continues in early 21st century. Today, an estimated 10 million people of Sicilian origin live around the world.

=== Largest cities ===
These are the ten largest cities of Sicily:
=== Religion ===
As in most Italian regions, Roman Catholicism is the predominant religious denomination in Sicily, and the church still plays an important role in the lives of most people. There is also a notable small minority of Eastern-rite Byzantine Catholics which has a mixed congregation of ethnic Albanians; it is operated by the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church. Most people still attend church weekly or at least for religious festivals, and many people get married in churches. There was a wide presence of Jews in Sicily for at least 1,400 years and possibly for more than 2,000 years. Some scholars believe that the Sicilian Jewry are partial ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews. However, much of the Jewish community faded away when they were expelled from the island in 1492. Islam was present during the Emirate of Sicily, although Muslims were also expelled. Today, mostly due to immigration to the island, there are also several religious minorities, such as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, and Sikhism. There are also a some Evangelical Christians who live on the island. As of 2020, there are approximately 4,989,921 Roman Catholics in Sicily constituting about 99.2% of the island&#x27;s population. Additionally there are also about 23,120 members of the Italo-Albanian Catholic Church also living in Sicily constituting roughly 0.5% of the population.

==Politics==

The politics of Sicily takes place in a framework of a presidential representative democracy, whereby the President of Regional Government is the head of government, and of a pluriform multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the Regional Government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the Sicilian Regional Assembly. The capital of Sicily is Palermo.

Traditionally, Sicily votes for centre-right parties during elections. From 1943 to 1951, there was also a separatist political party called Sicilian Independence Movement (&quot;Movimento Indipendentista Siciliano&quot;, MIS). Their most successful result was at the 1946 general election, when MIS obtained 0.7% of national votes (8.8% of votes in Sicily), and four seats. However, the movement lost all their seats following the 1948 general election and the 1951 regional election. Even though it has never been formally disbanded, today the movement is no longer part of the politics of Sicily. After World War II, Sicily became a stronghold of the Christian Democracy. Sicily is now governed by a centre-right coalition. Renato Schifani is the current President and has served since 2022.

===Administrative divisions===

Administratively, Sicily is divided into nine provinces, each with a capital city of the same name as the province. Small surrounding islands are also part of various Sicilian provinces: the Aeolian Islands (Messina), isle of Ustica (Palermo), Aegadian Islands (Trapani), isle of Pantelleria (Trapani) and Pelagian Islands (Agrigento).
==Economy==
Thanks to regular growth in recent years, Sicily is the eighth largest regional economy of Italy in terms of total GDP (see List of Italian regions by GDP). A series of reforms and investments in agriculture, such as the introduction of modern irrigation systems, has made this important industry competitive. In the 1970s, some factories were opened, resulting in growth in the industrial sector. In recent years the service industry has become more important due to the opening of several shopping malls and some modest growth in financial and telecommunication activities. Tourism is an important source of income for the island, which attracts visitors due to its rich natural and historical heritage. Today Sicily is investing a large amount of money into the development of its hospitality industry, to attract even more tourism. However, Sicily continues to have a GDP per capita below the Italian average, and higher unemployment than the rest of Italy.

===Agriculture===

Sicily has long been noted for its fertile soil, which is the result of past volcanic eruptions. The local agriculture is also helped by the pleasant climate of the island. The main agricultural products are wheat, citrons, oranges &quot;(Arancia Rossa di Sicilia IGP)&quot;, lemons, tomatoes &quot;(Pomodoro di Pachino IGP)&quot;, olives, olive oil, artichokes, prickly pear &quot;(Fico d&#x27;India dell&#x27;Etna DOP)&quot;, almonds, grapes, pistachios &quot;(Pistacchio di Bronte DOP)&quot; and wine. Cattle and sheep are raised. The production of cheese is particularly important thanks to the Ragusano DOP and the Pecorino Siciliano DOP. Ragusa is noted for its honey (&quot;Miele Ibleo&quot;) and chocolate (&quot;Cioccolato di Modica IGP&quot;) products.

Sicily is the third largest wine producer in Italy, after Veneto and Emilia Romagna (and Italy is the world&#x27;s largest wine producer). The region is known mainly for fortified Marsala wines. In recent decades the wine industry has improved, new winemakers are experimenting with less-well-known native varieties, and Sicilian wines have become better known. The best known local variety is Nero d&#x27;Avola named after Avola, a town not far from Syracuse. Other important native varieties are: Nerello Mascalese, used to make the Etna Rosso DOC wine; Frappato, a component of the Cerasuolo di Vittoria DOCG wine; Moscato di Pantelleria (also known as &quot;Zibibbo&quot;), which is used to make different Pantelleria wines; Malvasia di Lipari, used for the Malvasia di Lipari DOC wine; and Catarratto, mostly used to make a white wine, Alcamo DOC. Furthermore, in Sicily, high-quality wines are also produced using non-native varieties like Syrah, Chardonnay and Merlot.

Sicily is also known for its liqueurs, such as Amaro Averna, produced in Caltanissetta, and the local limoncello.

Fishing is another fundamental resource for Sicily. It has important tuna, sardine, swordfish and European anchovy fisheries. Mazara del Vallo is the largest fishing centre in Sicily and one of the most important in Italy.

===Industry and manufacturing===
Improvements in Sicily&#x27;s road system have helped to promote industrial development. The region has three important industrial districts:
* &quot;Catania Industrial District&quot;, where there are several food industries and one of the best European electronics industry centres called &quot;Etna Valley&quot; (in honour of the best known Silicon Valley) which contains offices and factories of international companies such as STMicroelectronics and Numonyx;
* &quot;Syracuse Petrochemical District&quot; with chemical industries, oil refineries and important power stations (as the innovative Archimede combined cycle power plant);
* the latest &quot;Enna Industrial District&quot; in which there are food industries.
In Palermo there are important shipyards (such as Fincantieri), mechanical factories of famous Italian companies as Ansaldo Breda, publishing and textile industries. Chemical industries are also in the Province of Messina (Milazzo) and in the Province of Caltanissetta (Gela).
There are petroleum, natural gas and asphalt fields in the Southeast (mostly near Ragusa) and massive deposits of halite in Central Sicily. The Province of Trapani is one of the largest sea salt producers in Italy.

===Statistics===
====GDP growth====
Sicily&#x27;s GDP (nominal and per capita) growth between 2000 and 2008 was as follows:
====Economic sectors====
Sectors of the Sicilian economy in 2006:
==== Unemployment rate ====
The unemployment rate was 21.5% in 2018 and was one of the highest in Italy and Europe.
==Transport==
===Roads===
Highways have been built and expanded in the last four decades. The most prominent Sicilian roads are the motorways (known as ) in the north of the island. Much of the motorway network is elevated on pillars due to the island&#x27;s mountainous terrain. Other main roads in Sicily are the &quot;Strade Statali&quot;, such as the SS.113 that connects Trapani to Messina (via Palermo), the SS.114 Messina-Syracuse (via Catania) and the SS.115 Syracuse-Trapani (via Ragusa, Gela and Agrigento).
===Railways===

The first railway in Sicily was opened in 1863 (Palermo-Bagheria) and today all of the Sicilian provinces are served by a network of railway services, linking to most major cities and towns; this service is operated by Trenitalia. Of the of railway tracks in use, over 60% has been electrified whilst the remaining are serviced by diesel engines. 88% of the lines (1.209 km) are single-track and only are double-track serving the two main routes, Messina-Palermo (Tyrrhenian) and Messina-Catania-Syracuse (Ionian), which are the main lines of this region. Of the narrow-gauge railways the Ferrovia Circumetnea is the only one that still operates, going round Mount Etna. From the major cities of Sicily, there are services to Naples, Rome and Milan; this is achieved by the trains being loaded onto ferries which cross the Strait.

In Catania there is an underground railway service (metropolitana di Catania); in Palermo the national railway operator Trenitalia operates a commuter rail (Palermo metropolitan railway service), the Sicilian Capital is also served by 4 AMAT (Comunal Public Transport Operator) tramlines; Messina is served by a tramline.

===Airports===
Sicily has several airports that serve numerous Italian and European destinations and some extra-European.
* Catania-Fontanarossa Airport, located on the east coast, is the busiest on the island (and one of the busiest in all of Italy).
* Palermo International Airport, which is also a substantially large airport with many national and international flights.
* Trapani-Birgi Airport, a military-civil joint-use airport (third for traffic on the island). Recently the airport has seen an increase in traffic thanks to the low-cost carrier Ryanair.
* Comiso-Ragusa Airport, has recently been refurbished and re-converted from military use to a civil airport. It was opened to commercial traffic and general aviation on 30 May 2013.
* Palermo-Boccadifalco Airport is the old airport of Palermo and is currently used for general aviation and as a base for the Guardia di Finanza and police helicopters.
* NAS Sigonella Airport, it is an Italian Air Force and US Navy installation.
* Lampedusa Airport.
* Pantelleria Airport.

===Ports===

By sea, Sicily is served by several ferry routes and cargo ports, and in all major cities, cruise ships dock on a regular basis.
* Mainland Italy: Ports connecting to the mainland are Messina (route to Villa San Giovanni and Salerno), the busiest passenger port in Italy, Palermo (routes to Genoa, Civitavecchia and Naples) and Catania (route to Naples).
* Sicily&#x27;s small surrounding islands: The port of Milazzo serves the Aeolian Islands, the ports of Trapani and Marsala the Aegadian Islands and the port of Porto Empedocle the Pelagie Islands. From Palermo there is a service to the island of Ustica and to Sardinia.
* International connections: From Palermo and Trapani there are weekly services to Tunisia and there is also a daily service between Malta and Pozzallo.
* Commercial and cargo ports: The port of Augusta is the fifth-largest cargo port in Italy and handles tonnes of goods. Other major cargo ports are Palermo, Catania, Trapani, Pozzallo and Termini Imerese.
* Touristic ports: Several ports along the Sicilian coast are in the service of private boats that need to moor on the island. The main ports for this traffic are in Marina di Ragusa, Riposto, Portorosa, Syracuse, Cefalù and Sciacca. In Sicily, Palermo is also a major centre for boat rental, with or without crew, in the Mediterranean.
* Fishing ports: Like all islands, Sicily also has many fishing ports. The most important is in Mazara del Vallo followed by Castellamare del Golfo, Licata, Scoglitti and Portopalo di Capo Passero.

===Planned bridge===

Plans for a bridge linking Sicily to the mainland have been discussed since 1865. Throughout the last decade, plans were developed for a road and rail link to the mainland via what would be the world&#x27;s longest suspension bridge, the Strait of Messina Bridge. Planning for the project has experienced several false starts over the past few decades. On 6 March 2009, Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s government declared that the construction works for the Messina Bridge would begin on 23 December 2009, and announced a pledge of €1.3 billion as a contribution to the bridge&#x27;s total cost, estimated at €6.1 billion. The plan has been criticized by environmental associations and some local Sicilians and Calabrians, concerned with its environmental impact, economic sustainability and even possible infiltrations by organized crime.

==Tourism==
Sicily&#x27;s sunny, dry climate, scenery, cuisine, history, and architecture attract many tourists from the rest of Italy and abroad. The tourist season peaks in the summer months, although people visit the island all year round. Mount Etna, the beaches, the archaeological sites, and major cities such as Palermo, Catania, Syracuse and Ragusa are the favourite tourist destinations, but the old town of Taormina and the neighbouring seaside resort of Giardini Naxos draw visitors from all over the world, as do the Aeolian Islands, Erice, Terrasini, Castellammare del Golfo, Cefalù, Agrigento, the Pelagie Islands and Capo d&#x27;Orlando. The last features some of the best-preserved temples of the ancient Greek period. Many Mediterranean cruise ships stop in Sicily, and many wine tourists also visit the island.

Some scenes of several Hollywood and Cinecittà films were shot in Sicily. This increased the attraction of Sicily as a tourist destination.

===UNESCO World Heritage Sites===

There are seven UNESCO World Heritage Sites on Sicily. By the order of inscription:
* Valle dei Templi (1997) is one of the most outstanding examples of Magna Graecia art and architecture, and is one of the main attractions of Sicily as well as a national monument of Italy. The site is located in Agrigento.
* Villa Romana del Casale (1997) is a Roman villa built in the first quarter of the 4th century and located about outside the town of Piazza Armerina. It contains the richest, largest and most complex collection of Roman mosaics in the world.
* Aeolian Islands (2000) are a volcanic archipelago in the Tyrrhenian Sea, named after the demigod of the winds Aeolus. The Aeolian Islands are a tourist destination in the summer, and attract up to 200,000 visitors annually.
* Late Baroque Towns of the Val di Noto (2002) &quot;represent the culmination and final flowering of Baroque art in Europe&quot;. It includes several towns: Caltagirone, Militello in Val di Catania, Catania, Modica, Noto, Palazzolo Acreide, Ragusa and Scicli.
* Necropolis of Pantalica (2005) is a large Necropolis in Sicily with over 5,000 tombs dating from the 13th to the 7th centuries BC. Syracuse is notable for its rich Greek history, culture, amphitheatres and architecture. They are situated in south-eastern Sicily.
* Mount Etna (2013) is one of the most active volcanoes in the world and is in an almost constant state of activity and generated myths, legends and naturalistic observation from Greek, Celts and Roman classic and medieval times.
* Arab-Norman Palermo and the cathedral churches of Cefalù and Monreale; includes a series of nine civil and religious structures dating from the era of the Norman kingdom of Sicily (1130–1194)
====Tentative UNESCO World Heritage sites====

* Taormina and Isola Bella;
* Motya and Libeo Island: The Phoenician-Punic Civilisation in Italy;
* Scala dei Turchi;
* Strait of Messina.

===Archaeological sites===
Because many different cultures settled, dominated or invaded the island, Sicily has a huge variety of archaeological sites. Also, some of the most notable and best preserved temples and other structures of the Greek world are located in Sicily. Here is a short list of the major archaeological sites:
* Sicels/Sicans/Elymians/Greeks: Segesta, Eryx, Cava Ispica, Thapsos, Pantalica;
* Greeks: Syracuse, Agrigento, Segesta, Selinunte, Gela, Kamarina, Himera, Megara Hyblaea, Naxos, Heraclea Minoa;
* Phoenicians: Motya, Soluntum, Marsala, Palermo;
* Romans: Piazza Armerina, Centuripe, Taormina, Palermo;
The excavation and restoration of one of Sicily&#x27;s best known archaeological sites, the Valley of the Temples in Agrigento, was at the direction of the archaeologist Domenico Antonio Lo Faso Pietrasanta, Fifth Duke of Serradifalco, known in archaeological circles simply as &quot;Serradifalco&quot;. He also oversaw the restoration of ancient sites at Segesta, Selinunte, Siracusa and Taormina.

===Castles===
In Sicily there are hundreds of castles, the most relevant are:


===Coastal towers===
The Coastal towers in Sicily (&quot;Torri costiere della Sicilia&quot;) are 218 old watchtowers along the coast. In Sicily, the first coastal towers date back to the late Norman period. From 1360 the threat came from the south, from North Africa to Maghreb, mainly to Barbary pirates and corsairs of Barbary Coast. In 1516, the Turks settled in Algiers, and from 1520, the corsair Hayreddin Barbarossa under the command of Ottoman Empire, operated from that harbour.

Most existing towers were built on architectural designs of the Florentine architect Camillo Camilliani from [1583] to 1584 and involved the coastal periple of Sicily. The typology changed completely in &#x27;800, because of the new higher fire volumes of cannon vessels, the towers were built on the type of Martello towers that the British built in the UK and elsewhere in the British Empire. The decline of Mediterranean piracy caused by the Second Barbary War led to a smaller number of coastal towers built during the 19th century.

===Historical villages===
Sicily has many small and picturesque villages; 24 of them have been selected by (), a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest, that was founded on the initiative of the Tourism Council of the National Association of Italian Municipalities.

==Culture==


Sicily has long been associated with the arts; many poets, writers, philosophers, intellectuals, architects and painters have roots on the island. Among the earliest illuminaries there are Gorgias and Empedocles, two highly noted Sicilian-Greek philosophers, while the Syracusan-Greek Epicharmus is held to be the inventor of comedy. One of the most famous intellectuals in Greek antiquity was Archimedes, a Syracuse native who is recognized as one of the greatest mathematicians of all time. 

===Art and architecture===
Baglio are traditional living structures in Western Sicily.

==== Ceramics ====
Terracotta ceramics from the island are well known, the art of ceramics on Sicily goes back to the original ancient peoples named the Sicanians, it was then perfected during the period of Greek colonisation and is still prominent and distinct to this day. Nowadays, Caltagirone is one of the most important centres in Sicily for the artistic production of ceramics and terra-cotta sculptures. Famous painters include Renaissance artist Antonello da Messina, Pietro Novelli, Bruno Caruso, Renato Guttuso and Greek born Giorgio de Chirico who is commonly dubbed the &quot;father of Surrealist art&quot; and founder of the metaphysical art movement. The most noted architects are Filippo Juvarra (one of the most important figures of the Italian Baroque) and Ernesto Basile.

====Sicilian Baroque====
The Sicilian Baroque has a unique architectural identity. Noto, Caltagirone, Catania, Ragusa, Modica, Scicli and particularly Acireale contain some of Italy&#x27;s best examples of Baroque architecture, carved in the local red sandstone. Noto provides one of the best examples of the Baroque architecture brought to Sicily. The Baroque style in Sicily was largely confined to buildings erected by the church, and palazzi built as private residences for the Sicilian aristocracy. The earliest examples of this style in Sicily lacked individuality and were typically heavy-handed pastiches of buildings seen by Sicilian visitors to Rome, Florence, and Naples. However, even at this early stage, provincial architects had begun to incorporate certain vernacular features of Sicily&#x27;s older architecture. By the middle of the 18th century, when Sicily&#x27;s Baroque architecture was noticeably different from that of the mainland, it has a unique freedom of design that is difficult to characterize in words.

===Music and film===

Palermo hosts the Teatro Massimo which is the largest opera house in Italy and the third largest in all of Europe. In Catania there is another important opera house, the Teatro Massimo Bellini with 1,200 seats, which is considered one of the best European opera houses for its acoustics. Sicily&#x27;s composers vary from Vincenzo Bellini, Sigismondo d&#x27;India, Giovanni Pacini and Alessandro Scarlatti, to contemporary composers such as Salvatore Sciarrino and Silvio Amato.

Many films of Italian cinema have been filmed in Sicily, amongst the most noted of which are: Visconti&#x27;s &quot;La Terra Trema&quot; and &quot;Il Gattopardo&quot;, Pietro Germi&#x27;s &quot;Divorzio all&#x27;Italiana&quot; and &quot;Sedotta e Abbandonata&quot;, Tornatore&#x27;s &quot;Cinema Paradiso&quot;.

The annual Taormina Film Fest takes places in Taormina.

===Literature===
The golden age of Sicilian poetry began in the early 13th century with the Sicilian School of Giacomo da Lentini, which was highly influential on Italian literature. Some of the most noted figures among writers and poets are Luigi Pirandello (Nobel laureate, 1934), Salvatore Quasimodo (Nobel laureate, 1959), Giovanni Verga (the father of the &quot;Italian Verismo&quot;), Domenico Tempio, Giovanni Meli, Luigi Capuana, Mario Rapisardi, Federico de Roberto, Leonardo Sciascia, Vitaliano Brancati, Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, Elio Vittorini, Vincenzo Consolo and Andrea Camilleri (noted for his novels and short stories with the fictional character Inspector Salvo Montalbano as protagonist). On the political side notable philosophers include Gaetano Mosca and Giovanni Gentile who wrote &quot;The Doctrine of Fascism&quot;.

===Languages===
Today, in Sicily, most people are bilingual and speak both Italian and Sicilian, a Romance language distinct from Italian. Some Sicilian words are loanwords from Greek, Catalan, Norman, French, Arabic, Spanish and other languages. Varieties related to Sicilian are also spoken in Calabria and Salento. Nowadays, the use of Sicilian is limited to informal contexts (mostly in family) and in a majority of cases it is replaced by the so-called &quot;regional Italian of Sicily&quot;, a variety of Italian that is influenced by Sicilian. Sicilian had a significant influence on the Maltese language.

Sicilian was an early influence in the development of the first Italian standard, although its use remained confined to an intellectual elite. This was a literary language in Sicily created under the auspices of Frederick II and his court of notaries, or &quot;Magna Curia&quot;, which, headed by Giacomo da Lentini, also gave birth to the Sicilian School, widely inspired by troubadour literature. Its linguistic and poetic heritage was later assimilated into the literary Florentine dialect use by Dante Alighieri, the father of modern Italian. Dante, in his , claims that &quot;In effect, this vernacular seems to deserve higher praise than the others since all the poetry written by Italians can be called Sicilian&quot;. It is in this language that appeared the first sonnet, whose invention is attributed to Giacomo da Lentini himself.

Other languages are spoken in Sicily. Within the province of Palermo, four towns are home to speakers of Arbëresh varieties. Arbëresh is the name given to varieties of Albanian spoken in Italy. In the eastern part of the island, there are Gallo-Italic varieties known as Gallo-Italic of Sicily, which are related to the other Gallo-Italic languages spoken in most of northern Italy and in other isolated pockets of southern Italy.

===Science===

Catania has one of the four laboratories of the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (National Institute for Nuclear Physics) in which there is a cyclotron that uses protons both for nuclear physics experiments and for particle therapy to treat cancer (proton therapy). Noto has one of the largest radio telescopes in Italy that performs geodetic and astronomical observations. There are observatories in Palermo and Catania, managed by the (National Institute for Astrophysics). In the &quot;Observatory of Palermo&quot; the astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered the first and the largest asteroid to be identified Ceres (today considered a dwarf planet) on 1 January 1801; Catania has two observatories, one of which is situated on Mount Etna at .

Syracuse is also an experimental centre for solar technologies through the creation of the project Archimede solar power plant that is the first concentrated solar power plant to use molten salt for heat transfer and storage which is integrated with a combined-cycle gas facility. All the plant is owned and operated by Enel. The touristic town of Erice is also an important science place thanks to the Ettore Majorana Foundation and Centre for Scientific Culture which
embraces 123 schools from all over the world, covering all branches of science, offering courses, seminars, workshops, and annual meetings. It was founded by the physicist Antonino Zichichi in honour of another scientist of the island, Ettore Majorana known for the Majorana equation and Majorana fermions. Sicily&#x27;s famous scientists also include Stanislao Cannizzaro (chemist), Giovanni Battista Hodierna and Niccolò Cacciatore (astronomers).
===Education===
Sicily has four universities:
* The University of Catania dates back to 1434 and it is the oldest university in Sicily. It currently hosts 12 faculties and over 62,000 students and it offers undergraduate and postgraduate programs. Catania hosts also the &quot;Scuola Superiore&quot;, an academic institution linked to the University of Catania, aiming for excellence in education.
* The University of Palermo is the island&#x27;s second-oldest university. It was officially founded in 1806, although historical records indicate that medicine and law have been taught there since the late 15th century. The Orto botanico di Palermo (Palermo botanical gardens) is home to the university&#x27;s Department of Botany and is also open to visitors.
* The University of Messina, founded in 1548 by Ignatius of Loyola. It is organized in 11 Faculties.
* The Kore University of Enna founded in 1995, is the latest Sicilian university and the first university founded in Sicily after the Italian Unification.

===Cuisine===


The island has a long history of producing a variety of noted cuisines and wines, to the extent that Sicily is sometimes nicknamed &quot;God&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; because of this. Every part of Sicily has its speciality (e.g. Cassata is typical of Palermo although available everywhere in Sicily, as is Granita). The ingredients are typically rich in taste while remaining affordable to the general public. The savoury dishes of Sicily are viewed to be healthy, using fresh vegetables and fruits, such as tomatoes, artichokes, olives (including olive oil), citrus, apricots, aubergines, onions, beans, raisins commonly coupled with seafood, freshly caught from the surrounding coastlines, including tuna, sea bream, sea bass, cuttlefish, swordfish, sardines, and others.

The most well-known part of Sicilian cuisine is the rich sweet dishes including ice creams and pastries. Cannoli (singular: &quot;cannolo&quot;), a tube-shaped shell of fried pastry dough filled with a sweet filling usually containing ricotta, is strongly associated with Sicily worldwide. Biancomangiare, biscotti ennesi (cookies native to Enna), braccilatte (a Sicilian version of doughnuts), buccellato, ciarduna, pignoli, Biscotti Regina, giurgiulena, frutta martorana, cassata, pignolata, granita, cuccidati (a variety of fig cookie; also known as buccellati) and cuccìa are some notable sweet dishes.

Like the cuisine of the rest of southern Italy, pasta plays an important part in Sicilian cuisine, as does rice; for example with arancini. As well as using some other cheeses, Sicily has spawned some of its own, using both cow&#x27;s and sheep&#x27;s milk, such as pecorino and caciocavallo. Spices used include saffron, nutmeg, clove, pepper, and cinnamon, which were introduced by the Arabs. Parsley is used abundantly in many dishes. Although Sicilian cuisine is commonly associated with sea food, meat dishes, including goose, lamb, goat, rabbit, and turkey, are also found in Sicily. It was the Normans and Swabians who first introduced a fondness for meat dishes to the island. Some varieties of wine are produced from vines that are relatively unique to the island, such as the Nero d&#x27;Avola made near the baroque town of Noto.

===Sports===

The most popular sport in Sicily is football, which came to the fore in the late 19th century under the influence of the English. Some of the oldest football clubs in Italy are from Sicily: the three most successful are Palermo, Catania, and Messina, which have played 29, 17 and 5 seasons in the Serie A respectively. No club from Sicily has ever won Serie A, but football is still deeply embedded in local culture and all over Sicily most towns have a representative team.

Palermo and Catania have a heated rivalry and compete in the Sicilian derby together. Palermo is the only team in Sicily to have played on the European stage, in the UEFA Cup. In the island, the most noted footballer is Salvatore Schillaci, who won the Golden Boot at the 1990 FIFA World Cup with Italy. Other noted players include Giuseppe Furino, Pietro Anastasi, Francesco Coco, Christian Riganò, and Roberto Galia. There have also been some noted managers from the island, such as Carmelo Di Bella and Franco Scoglio.

Although football is the most popular sport in Sicily, the island also has participants in other fields. Amatori Catania have competed in the top Italian national rugby union league called National Championship of Excellence. They have even participated at the European level in the European Challenge Cup. Competing in the basketball variation of Serie A is Orlandina Basket from Capo d&#x27;Orlando in the province of Messina, where the sport has a reasonable following. Various other sports that are played to some extent include volleyball, handball, and water polo. Previously, in motorsport, Sicily held the prominent Targa Florio sports car race that took place in the Madonie Mountains, with the start-finish line in Cerda. The event was started in 1906 by Sicilian industrialist and automobile enthusiast Vincenzo Florio, and ran until it was canceled due to safety concerns in 1977.

From 28 September to 9 October 2005 Trapani was the location of Acts 8 and 9 of the Louis Vuitton Cup. This sailing race featured, among other entrants, all boats that took part in the 2007 America&#x27;s Cup.

===Popular culture===
Each town and city has its own patron saint, and the feast days are marked by colourful processions through the streets with marching bands and displays of fireworks.

Sicilian religious festivals also include the &quot;presepe vivente&quot; (living nativity scene), which takes place at Christmas time. Deftly combining religion and folklore, it is a constructed mock 19th-century Sicilian village, complete with a nativity scene, and has people of all ages dressed in the costumes of the period, some impersonating the Holy Family, and others working as artisans of their particular assigned trade. It is normally concluded on Epiphany, often highlighted by the arrival of the magi on horseback.

Oral tradition plays a large role in Sicilian folklore. Many stories passed down from generation to generation involve a character named &quot;Giufà&quot;. Anecdotes from this character&#x27;s life preserve Sicilian culture as well as convey moral messages.

Sicilians also enjoy outdoor festivals, held in the local square or &quot;piazza&quot; where live music and dancing are performed on stage, and food fairs or &quot;sagre&quot; are set up in booths lining the square. These offer various local specialties, as well as typical Sicilian food. Normally these events are concluded with fireworks. A noted &quot;sagra&quot; is the &quot;Sagra del Carciofo&quot; or &quot;Artichoke Festival&quot;, which is held annually in Ramacca in April. The most important traditional event in Sicily is the carnival. Famous carnivals are in Acireale, Misterbianco, Regalbuto, Paternò, Sciacca, Termini Imerese.

The Opera dei Pupi (Opera of the Puppets; Sicilian: Òpira dî pupi) is a marionette theatrical representation of Frankish romantic poems such as the Song of Roland or &quot;Orlando furioso&quot; that is one of the characteristic cultural traditions of Sicily. The sides of donkey carts are decorated with intricate, painted scenes; these same tales are enacted in traditional puppet theatres featuring hand-made marionettes of wood. The opera of the puppets and the Sicilian tradition of &quot;cantastorî&quot; (singers of tales) are rooted in the Provençal troubadour tradition in Sicily during the reign of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, in the first half of the 13th century. A great place to see this marionette art is the puppet theatres of Palermo. The Sicilian marionette theatre Opera dei Pupi was proclaimed in 2001 and inscribed in 2008 in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

Today, there are only a few troupes that maintain the tradition. They often perform for tourists. However, there are no longer the great historical families of marionettists, such as the Greco of Palermo; the Canino of Partinico and Alcamo; Crimi, Trombetta and Napoli of Catania, Pennisi and Macri of Acireale, Profeta of Licata, Gargano and Grasso of Agrigento. One can, however, admire the richest collection of marionettes at the Museo Internazionale delle Marionette Antonio Pasqualino and at the Museo Etnografico Siciliano Giuseppe Pitrè in Palermo. Other elaborate marionettes are on display at the Museo Civico Vagliasindi in Randazzo.

===Traditional items===
The Sicilian cart is an ornate, colourful style of a horse- or donkey-drawn cart native to Sicily. Sicilian woodcarver George Petralia states that horses were mostly used in the city and flat plains, while donkeys or mules were more often used in rough terrain for hauling heavy loads. The cart has two wheels and is primarily handmade out of wood with iron components.

The Sicilian coppola is a traditional kind of flat cap typically worn by men in Sicily. First used by English nobles during the late 18th century, the &quot;tascu&quot; began being used in Sicily in the early 20th century as a driving cap, usually worn by car drivers. The &quot;coppola&quot; is usually made in tweed. Today it is widely regarded as a definitive symbol of Sicilian heritage.

=== Flag and emblem===
The Flag of Sicily, regarded as a regional icon, was first adopted in 1282, after the Sicilian Vespers of Palermo. It is characterised by the presence of the triskeles in the middle, depicting the head of Medusa and three wheat ears representing the extreme fertility of the land of Sicily. In early mythology, when Medusa was slain and beheaded by Perseus, the Medusa head was placed in the centre of Athena&#x27;s shield.

Palermo and Corleone were the first two cities to found a confederation against the Angevin rule. The triskeles symbol came to be on the Sicilian flag in 1943 during World War II when Andrea Finocchiaro Aprile led an independence movement, in collaboration with the allies. Their plan was to help Sicily become independent and form a free republic. The colours, likewise introduced in the 1940s, respectively represent the cities of Palermo and Corleone. The separatist behind the movement used a yellow and red flag with the Trinacria in the centre of it. When World War II ended, Sicily was recognized as an autonomous region in the Italian Republic.

The flag became the official public flag of the &quot;Regione Siciliana&quot; in January 2000, after the passing of an apposite regional law which advocates its use on public buildings, schools and city halls along with the national Italian flag and the European one.

Familiar as an ancient symbol of the region, the Triskelion is also featured on Greek coins of Syracuse, such as coins of Agathocles (317–289 BC).The symbol dates back to when Sicily was part of Magna Graecia, the colonial extension of Greece beyond the Aegean. The triskelion was revived, as a neoclassic – and non-Bourbon – emblem for the new Napoleonic Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, by Joachim Murat in 1808. In the case of Sicily, the triskelion symbol is said to represent the three capes (headlands or promontories of the island of Sicily, namely: Pelorus (Peloro, Tip of Faro, Messina: North-East); Pachynus (Passero, Syracuse: South); and Lilybæum (Lilibeo, Cape Boeo, Marsala: West), which form three points of a triangle.

<doc id="27628" wikidata="Q208236" url="?curid=27628" title="Stanley Milgram">
<text>Stanley Milgram (August 15, 1933 – December 20, 1984) was an American social psychologist known for his controversial experiments on obedience conducted in the 1960s during his professorship at Yale.

Milgram was influenced by the events of the Holocaust, especially the trial of Adolf Eichmann, in developing the experiment. After earning a PhD in social psychology from Harvard University, he taught at Yale, Harvard, and then for most of his career as a professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center, until his death in 1984.

Milgram gained notoriety for his obedience experiment conducted in the basement of Linsly-Chittenden Hall at Yale University in 1961, three months after the start of the trial of German Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem. The experiment found, unexpectedly, that a very high proportion of subjects would fully obey the instructions, albeit reluctantly. Milgram first described his research in a 1963 article in the &quot;Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology&quot; and later discussed his findings in greater depth in his 1974 book, &quot;Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View.&quot;

His other small-world experiment, while at Harvard, led researchers to analyze the degree of connectedness, including the six degrees of separation concept. Later in his career, Milgram developed a technique for creating interactive hybrid social agents (called cyranoids), which has since been used to explore aspects of social- and self-perception.

He is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the history of social psychology. A &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; survey, published in 2002, ranked Milgram as the 46th-most-cited psychologist of the 20th century.

== Biography==

=== Early life, education, and family ===
Milgram was born in 1933 in New York City (the Bronx) to Jewish parents. His parents were Adele (née Israel) and Samuel Milgram (1898–1953), who had immigrated to the United States from Romania and Hungary respectively during World War I. He was the second of three children. Milgram&#x27;s immediate and extended family were both affected by the Holocaust. After the war, relatives of his who had survived Nazi concentration camps and bore concentration camp tattoos stayed with the Milgram family in New York for a time.

His Bar Mitzvah speech in 1946 was on the subject of the plight of the European Jews and the impact that the events of World War II would have on Jewish people around the world. He said, upon becoming a man under Jewish law: &quot;As I ... find happiness in joining the ranks of Israel, the knowledge of the tragic suffering of my fellow Jews ... makes this ... an occasion to reflect upon the heritage of my people—which now becomes mine. ... I shall try to understand my people and do my best to share the responsibilities which history has placed upon all of us.&quot; He later wrote to a friend from childhood: &quot;I should have been born into the German-speaking Jewish community of Prague in 1922 and died in a gas chamber some 20 years later. How I came to be born in the Bronx Hospital, I&#x27;ll never quite understand.&quot;

Milgram&#x27;s interest in the Holocaust had its basis in what his biographer, Professor Thomas Blass, referred to as Milgram&#x27;s &quot;lifelong identification with the Jewish people&quot;. Author Kirsten Fermaglich wrote that Milgram as an adult had &quot;a personal conflict as a Jewish man who perceived himself both as an outsider, a victim of the Nazi destruction, and as an insider, as scientist.&quot; Alexandra stated that Milgram&#x27;s Jewish identity led to his focus on the Holocaust and his obedience-to-authority research. He shared this as well with Herbert Winer, one of his obedience study subjects, who noted after speaking to Milgram about the experiment that &quot;Milgram was very Jewish. I was Jewish. We talked about this. There was obviously a motive behind neutral research.&quot;

Milgram married his wife, Alexandra, in a ceremony at the Brotherhood Synagogue in Greenwich Village in Manhattan on December 10, 1961, and they had two children, Michele and Marc. At the time of his death, Milgram lived in New Rochelle, New York.

Milgram&#x27;s father worked as a baker, providing a modest income for his family until his death in 1953 (upon which Stanley&#x27;s mother took over the bakery). Milgram attended public elementary school and James Monroe High School in the Bronx (which he graduated from in three years), and excelled academically and was a great leader among his peers. One of Milgram&#x27;s classmates at James Monroe High School was Philip Zimbardo, the architect of the Stanford prison experiment. Milgram and Zimbardo also shared an affinity for the popular television program &quot;Candid Camera&quot; and an admiration for its creator, Allen Funt.

By the time he was college age, his family had moved to nearby Queens. In 1954, Milgram received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science from Queens College in New York, which he attended tuition-free. He also studied at Brooklyn College, where he received A-grades in &quot;Psychology of Personality&quot; and &quot;An Eclectic Approach to Social Psychology&quot;. He applied to a PhD program in social psychology at Harvard University, and was initially rejected due to an insufficient background in psychology (he had not taken any undergraduate courses in psychology at Queens College). He was eventually accepted to Harvard in 1954 after first enrolling as a student in Harvard&#x27;s Office of Special Students.

=== Academic career ===
In 1961, Milgram received a PhD in social psychology from Harvard. He became an assistant professor at Yale in the fall of 1960. He served as an assistant professor in the Department of Social Relations at Harvard from 1963 to 1966 on a three-year contract. The contract was then extended for one additional year, but with the lower rank of a lecturer.

In 1967 he accepted an offer to become a tenured full professor at the City University of New York Graduate Center, and he taught at City University until he died in 1984. Milgram had a number of significant influences, including psychologists Solomon Asch and Gordon Allport.

=== Death ===
Milgram died on December 20, 1984, aged 51, of a heart attack in New York City. It was his fifth heart attack. He left behind a widow, Alexandra &quot;Sasha&quot; Milgram, a daughter, Michele Sara, and a son, Marc Daniel.

==Obedience to authority==
In 1963, Milgram submitted the results of his obedience experiments in the article &quot;Behavioral Study of Obedience&quot;. In the ensuing controversy, the American Psychological Association held up his application for membership for a year because of questions about the ethics of his work, but eventually did grant him full membership. Ten years later, in 1974, Milgram published &quot;Obedience to Authority&quot;. He won the AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research in 1964, mostly for his work on the social aspects of obedience. Inspired in part by the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann, his models were later also used to explain the 1968 My Lai Massacre (including authority training in the military, depersonalizing the &quot;enemy&quot; through racial and cultural differences, etc.). He produced a film depicting his experiments, which are considered classics of social psychology.

An article in &quot;American Psychologist&quot; sums up Milgram&#x27;s obedience experiments: More recent tests of the experiment have found that it only works under certain conditions; in particular, when participants believe the results are necessary for the &quot;good of science&quot;.

According to Milgram, &quot;the essence of obedience consists in the fact that a person comes to view himself as the instrument for carrying out another person&#x27;s wishes, and he therefore no longer sees himself as responsible for his actions. Once this critical shift of viewpoint has occurred in the person, all of the essential features of obedience follow.&quot; Thus, &quot;the major problem for the subject is to recapture control of his own regnant processes once he has committed them to the purposes of the experimenter.&quot; Besides this hypothetical agentic state, Milgram proposed the existence of other factors accounting for the subject&#x27;s obedience: politeness, awkwardness of withdrawal, absorption in the technical aspects of the task, the tendency to attribute impersonal quality to forces that are essentially human, a belief that the experiment served a desirable end, the sequential nature of the action, and anxiety.

A competing explanation of Milgram&#x27;s results invokes belief perseverance as the underlying factor. What &quot;people cannot be counted on is to realize that a seemingly benevolent authority is in fact malevolent, even when they are faced with overwhelming evidence which suggests that this authority is indeed malevolent. Hence, the underlying cause for the subjects&#x27; striking conduct could well be conceptual, and not the alleged &#x27;capacity of man to abandon his humanity . . . as he merges his unique personality into larger institutional structures.&#x27;&quot;

Inspired by the horrific events of Nazi Germany, Milgram&#x27;s obedience experiments have been used to explain a range of social influences on the individual—including how police interrogators can get innocent people to confess to crimes they did not commit. At the same time, these experiments have come under attack. Some critics questioned whether subjects sensed the unreality of the situation. Others questioned the relevance of the laboratory setting to the real world.

The most devastating criticisms involved the ethics of the basic experimental design. Professor Milgram, for his part, felt that such misgivings were traceable to the unsavory nature of his results: &quot;Underlying the criticism of the experiment,&quot; Milgram wrote, &quot;is an alternative model of human nature, one holding that when confronted with a choice between hurting others and complying with authority, normal people reject authority.&quot;

Daniel Raver looks back:

==Small-world phenomenon==

The six degrees of separation concept was examined in Milgram&#x27;s 1967 &quot;small-world experiment&quot;, which tracked chains of acquaintances in the United States. In the experiment, Milgram sent several packages to 160 random people living in Omaha, Nebraska, asking them to forward the package to a friend or acquaintance who they thought would bring the package closer to a set final individual, a stockbroker from Boston, Massachusetts. Each &quot;starter&quot; received instructions to mail a folder via the U.S. Post Office to a recipient, but with some rules. Starters could only mail the folder to someone they actually knew personally on a first-name basis. When doing so, each starter instructed their recipient to mail the folder ahead to one of the latter&#x27;s first-name acquaintances with the same instructions, with the hope that their acquaintance might by some chance know the target recipient.

Given that starters knew only the target recipient&#x27;s name and address, they had a seemingly impossible task. Milgram monitored the progress of each chain via returned &quot;tracer&quot; postcards, which allowed him to track the progression of each letter. Surprisingly, he found that the very first folder reached the target in just four days and took only two intermediate acquaintances. Overall, Milgram reported that chains varied in length from two to ten intermediate acquaintances, with a median of five intermediate acquaintances (i.e. six degrees of separation) between the original sender and the destination recipient.

Milgram&#x27;s &quot;six degrees&quot; theory has been severely criticized. He did not follow up on many of the sent packages, and as a result, scientists are unconvinced that there are merely &quot;six degrees&quot; of separation. Elizabeth DeVita–Raebu has discussed potential problems with Milgram&#x27;s experiment.

In 2008, a study by Microsoft showed that the average chain of contacts between users of its &#x27;.NET Messenger Service&#x27; (later called Microsoft Messenger service) was 6.6 people.

Milgram developed a technique, called the &quot;lost letter&quot; experiment, for measuring how helpful people are to strangers who are not present, and their attitudes toward various groups. Several sealed and stamped letters were planted in public places, addressed to various entities, such as individuals, favorable organizations like medical research institutes, and stigmatized organizations such as &quot;Friends of the Nazi Party&quot;. Milgram found most of the letters addressed to individuals and favorable organizations were mailed, while most of those addressed to stigmatized organizations were not.

==Anti-social behavior experiment==
In 1970–71, Milgram conducted experiments which attempted to find a correlation between media consumption (in this case, watching television) and anti-social behavior. The experiment presented the opportunity to steal money, donate to charity, or neither, and tested whether the rate of each choice was influenced by watching similar actions in the ending of a specially crafted episode of the popular series &quot;Medical Center&quot;.

==Cyranoids==

In 1977 Milgram began piloting an experimental procedure that aimed to operationalize the mind-body fusion fantasy explored in the Edmond Rostand play &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;. In the story, Cyrano supplies Christian with amorous prose so that they may jointly woo Roxane (each being incapable, given their respective physical and linguistic limitations, of doing so on their own).

Milgram trained speech shadowers to replicate in real-time spontaneous prose supplied by a remote &quot;source&quot; by-way-of discreet radio transmission during face-to-face dialogue with naïve &quot;interactants&quot;. In homage to Cyrano, he referred to the hybrid agent formed by combining the words of one individual with the body of another as a &quot;cyranoid&quot;. In his studies, interactants repeatedly failed to detect that their interlocutors were merely speech shadowing for third parties, implicitly and explicitly attributing to them communicative autonomy. Milgram referred to this phenomenon as the &quot;cyranic illusion&quot;. This illusion held even in circumstances involving high disparity between shadower and source, such as when he sourced for child shadowers while being interviewed by panels of teachers (naïve to the deception) tasked with assessing each child&#x27;s intellectual abilities.

Milgram hoped that the cyranoid method could evolve into a useful means of interactively exploring phenomena related to social behavior and self-perception (e.g., racial, gender, and age-based stereotyping and behavioral confirmation). Though he continued to develop the methodology through 1984 (the year of his death), he never prepared a formal publication detailing his cyranoid experiments.

In 2014, social psychologists at the London School of Economics published the first replications of Milgram&#x27;s original pilots. Robb Mitchell has explored cyranoids as an experiential learning tool within the classroom (having children shadow for teachers during teaching exercises). Cyranoids have also been used in installation art to explore social experiences whereby people encounter those familiar to them through the bodies of strangers.

==References in media==
In 1975, CBS presented a made-for-television movie about obedience experiments, &quot;The Tenth Level&quot;, with William Shatner as Stephen Hunter, a Milgram-like scientist. Milgram was a consultant for the film, though the accuracy of the film has been contested by Milgram himself.

In 1980, musician Peter Gabriel wrote a song called &quot;We Do What We&#x27;re Told (Milgram&#x27;s 37)&quot;, referring to the number of subjects who administered the maximum shock in another one of the experiments - 37 out of 40. While it was played live on his 1980 tour, Gabriel did not release a studio version of the song until 1986, on his 5th album &quot;So&quot;.

Milgram 18 was reproduced to test the participants in a 2008 television special &quot;The Heist&quot;. Created by Derren Brown and Andy Nyman for British station Channel 4, the Milgram experiment helped determine which would be given the opportunity to rob a (fake) armoured bank van.

Milgram is a character in Chip Kidd&#x27;s novel &quot;The Learners&quot; (2008), overseeing his experiments at Yale.

In March 2010, French television channel France 2 broadcast &quot;Jusqu&#x27;où va la télé&quot;, describing the results of a fake game show that they had run 80 times (each time independently, and with a new contestant and audience). The contestants received instructions to administer what they thought would be near fatal electric shocks to another &quot;contestant&quot; (really an actor) when they erred on memorized word-associations. The vast majority followed instructions even as the &quot;victim&quot; screamed.

In 2015, an experimental biopic about Milgram called &quot;Experimenter&quot; was released, directed by Michael Almereyda. Peter Sarsgaard stars as Stanley Milgram.

In 2020, an online project known as the MILGRAM project portrays how a human would act if faced with the decision of being a prison guard to 10 different murderers. The project is still ongoing and has yet to be confirmed on its roots.

The OMVS have looked at the feasibility of creating a navigable channel in width between the small town of Ambidédi in Mali and Saint-Louis, a distance of . It would give landlocked Mali a direct route to the Atlantic Ocean.

The aquatic fauna in the Senegal River basin is closely associated with that of the Gambia River basin, and the two are usually combined under a single ecoregion known as the Senegal-Gambia Catchments. Only three species of frogs and one fish are endemic to this ecoregion.

The river has two large dams along its course, the Manantali Dam in Mali and the Maka-Diama Dam downstream on the Mauritania-Senegal border. In between is the Félou Hydroelectric Plant, built in 1927, but replaced in 2014. The construction of the Gouina Hydroelectric Plant upstream of Felou at Gouina Falls began in 2013.

== Geography ==

The Senegal&#x27;s headwaters are the Semefé (Bakoye) and Bafing rivers which both originate in Guinea; they form a small part of the Guinea–Mali border before coming together at Bafoulabé in Mali. From there, the Senegal river flows west and then north through Talari Gorges near Galougo and over the Gouina Falls, then flows more gently past Kayes, where it receives the Kolimbiné. After flowing together with the Karakoro, it prolongs the former&#x27;s course along the Mali–Mauritania border for some tens of kilometers till Bakel where it flows together with the Falémé River, which also has its source in Guinea, subsequently runs along a small part of the Guinea-Mali frontier to then trace most of the Senegal-Mali border up to Bakel. The Senegal further flows through semi-arid land in the north of Senegal, forming the border with Mauritania and into the Atlantic. In Kaedi it accepts the Gorgol from Mauritania. Flowing through Boghé it reaches Richard Toll where it is joined by the Ferlo coming from inland Senegal&#x27;s Lac de Guiers. It passes through Rosso and, approaching its mouth, around the Senegalese island on which the city of Saint-Louis is located, to then turn south. It is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a thin strip of sand called the Langue de Barbarie before it pours into the ocean itself.

The river has two large dams along its course, the multi-purpose Manantali Dam in Mali and the Maka-Diama Dam downstream on the Mauritania-Senegal border, near the outlet to the sea, preventing access of salt water upstream. In between Manantali and Maka-Diama is the Félou Hydroelectric Plant which was originally completed in 1927 and uses a weir. The power station was replaced in 2014. In 2013, construction of the Gouina Hydroelectric Plant upstream of Felou at Gouina Falls began.

The Senegal River has a drainage basin of , a mean flow of , and an annual discharge of . Important tributaries are the Falémé River, Karakoro River, and the Gorgol River.

Downstream of Kaédi the river divides into two branches. The left branch called the Doué runs parallel to the main river to the north. After the two branches rejoin a few kilometres downstream of Pondor. The long strip of land between the two branches is called the Île á Morfil.

In 1972 Mali, Mauritania and Senegal founded the Organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve Sénégal (OMVS) to manage the river basin. Guinea joined in 2005.

At the present time, only very limited use is made of the river for the transport of goods and passengers. The OMVS have looked at the feasibility of creating a navigable channel in width between the small town of Ambidédi in Mali and Saint-Louis, a distance of . It would give landlocked Mali a direct route to the Atlantic Ocean.

The aquatic fauna in the Senegal River basin is closely associated with that of the Gambia River basin, and the two are usually combined under a single ecoregion known as the Senegal-Gambia Catchments. Although the species richness is moderately high, only three species of frogs and one fish are endemic to this ecoregion.

== History ==
The area was previously occupied by the Serer people, who following their religious and ethnic persecution by Islamic forces in the 11th century, resulted in the Serer exodus to the south. 

The existence of the Senegal River was known to the early Mediterranean civilizations. It or some other river was called &quot;Bambotus&quot; by Pliny the Elder (possibly from Phoenician &quot;behemoth&quot; for hippopotamus) and &quot;Nias&quot; by Claudius Ptolemy. It was visited by Hanno the Carthaginian around 450 BCE at his navigation from Carthage through the pillars of Herakles to Theon Ochema (Mount Cameroon) in the Gulf of Guinea. There was trade from here to the Mediterranean World, until the destruction of Carthage and its west African trade net in 146 BCE.

=== Arab sources ===
In the Early Middle Ages (c. 800 CE), the Senegal River restored contact with the Mediterranean world with the establishment of the Trans-Saharan trade route between Morocco and the Ghana Empire. Arab geographers, like al-Masudi of Baghdad (957), al-Bakri of Spain (1068) and al-Idrisi of Sicily (1154), provided some of the earliest descriptions of the Senegal River. Early Arab geographers believed the upper Senegal River and the upper Niger River were connected to each other, and formed a single river flowing from east to west, which they called the &quot;Western Nile&quot;. (In fact, some of the headwaters of the Senegal River are near the Niger River in Mali and Guinea.) It was believed to be either a western branch of the Egyptian Nile River or drawn from the same source (variously conjectured to some great internal lakes of the Mountains of the Moon, or Ptolemy&#x27;s Gir (Γειρ) or the Biblical Gihon stream).
Arab geographers Abd al-Hassan Ali ibn Omar (1230), Ibn Said al-Maghribi (1274) and Abulfeda (1331), label the Senegal as the &quot;Nile of Ghana&quot; (Nil Gana or Nili Ganah).

As the Senegal River reached into the heart of the gold-producing Ghana Empire and later the Mali Empire, Trans-Saharan traders gave the Senegal its famous nickname as the &quot;River of Gold&quot;. The Trans-Saharan stories about the &quot;River of Gold&quot; reached the ears of Sub-Alpine European merchants that frequented the ports of Morocco and the lure proved irresistible. Arab historians report at least three separate Arab maritime expeditions - the last one organized by a group of eight &quot;mughrarin&quot; (&quot;wanderers&quot;) of Lisbon (before 1147) - that tried to sail down the Atlantic coast, possibly in an effort find the mouth of the Senegal.

=== Cartographic representation ===
Drawing from Classical legend and Arab sources, the &quot;River of Gold&quot; found its way into European maps in the 14th century. In the Hereford Mappa Mundi (c. 1300), there is a river labelled &quot;Nilus Fluvius&quot; drawn &quot;parallel&quot; to the coast of Africa, albeit without communication with Atlantic (it ends in a lake). It depicts some giant ants digging up gold dust from its sands, with the note &quot;Hic grandes formice auream serican [or servant] arenas&quot; (&quot;Here great ants guard gold sands&quot;). In the mappa mundi made by Pietro Vesconte for the c. 1320 atlas of Marino Sanuto, there is an unnamed river stemming from the African interior and opening in the Atlantic ocean. The 1351 Medici-Laurentian Atlas shows both the Egyptian Nile and the western Nile stemming from the same internal mountain range, with the note that &quot;Ilic coligitur aureaum&quot;. The portolan chart of Giovanni da Carignano (1310s-20s) has the river with the label, &quot;iste fluuis exit de nilo ubi multum aurum repperitur&quot;.

In the more accurately-drawn portolan charts, starting with the 1367 chart of Domenico and Francesco Pizzigano and carried on in the 1375 Catalan Atlas, the 1413 chart of the Catalan &quot;converso&quot; Mecia de Viladestes, etc. the &quot;River of Gold&quot; is depicted (if only speculatively), draining into the Atlantic Ocean somewhere just south of Cape Bojador. The legend of Cape Bojador as a terrifying obstacle, the &#x27;cape of no return&#x27; to European sailors, emerged around the same time (possibly encouraged by Trans-Saharan traders who did not want to see their land route sidestepped by sea).

The river is frequently depicted with a great river island midway, the &quot;Island of Gold&quot;, first mentioned by al-Masudi, and famously called &quot;&quot;Wangara&quot; by al-Idrisi and &quot;Palolus&quot;&quot; in the 1367 Pizzigani brothers chart. It is conjectured that this riverine &quot;island&quot; is in fact just the Bambuk-Buré goldfield district, which is practically surrounded on all sides by rivers - the Senegal river to the north, the Falémé River to the west, the Bakhoy to the east and the Niger and Tinkisso to the south.

The 1413 portolan chart of Mecia de Viladestes gives perhaps the most detailed depiction of the early state of European knowledge about the Senegal River prior to the 1440s. Viladestes labels it &quot;River of Gold&quot; (&quot;&quot;riu del or&quot;) and locates it a considerable distance south of Cape Bojador (&quot;buyeter&quot;) - indeed, south of a mysterious &quot;cap de abach&quot; (possibly Cape Timris). There are extensive notes about the plentifulness of ivory and gold in the area, including a note that reads


The galley of Jaume Ferrer is depicted off the coast on the left, with a quick note about his 1346 voyage. The golden round island at the mouth of the Senegal River is the indication (customary on portolan charts) of river mouth bars or islands - in this case, probably a reference to the Langue de Barbarie or the island of Saint-Louis). The first town, by the mouth of the Senegal, is called &quot;isingan&quot;&quot; (arguably the etymological source of the term &quot;Senegal&quot;). East of that, the Senegal forms a riverine island called &quot;&quot;insula de bronch&quot; (Île à Morfil). By its shores lies the city of &quot;tocoror&quot; (Takrur). Above it is a depiction of the Almoravid general Abu Bakr ibn Umar (&quot;Rex Bubecar&quot;) on a camel. Further east, along the river, is the seated emperor (mansa) of Mali (&quot;Rex Musa Meli&quot;, prob. Mansa Musa), holding a gold nugget. His capital, &quot;civitat musa meli&quot;&quot; is shown on the shores of the river, and the range of the Emperor of Mali&#x27;s sway is suggested by all the black banners (an inscription notes &quot;This lord of the blacks is called Musa Melli, Lord of Guinea, the greatest noble lord of these parts for the abundance of the gold which is collected in his lands&quot;. Curiously, there is a defiant gold-bannered town south of the river, labelled &quot;&quot;tegezeut&quot;&quot; (probably the Ta&#x27;adjast of al-Idrisi), and might be an ichoate reference to Djenné.

East of Mali, the river forms a lake or &quot;Island of Gold&quot; shown here studded with river-washed gold nuggets (this is what the Pizzigani brothers called the island of &quot;Palolus&quot;, and most commentators take to indicate the Bambuk-Buré goldfields). It is connected by many streams to the southerly &quot;mountains of gold&quot; (labelled &quot;&quot;montanies del lor&quot;, the Futa Djallon/Bambouk Mountains and Loma Mountains of Sierra Leone). It is evident the Senegal river morphs east, unbroken, into the Niger River - the cities of &quot;tenbuch&quot; (Timbuktu), &quot;geugeu&quot; (Gao) and &quot;mayna&quot;&quot; (Niamey? or a misplaced Niani?) are denoted along the same single river. South of them (barely visible) are what seem like the towns of Kukiya (on the eastern shore of the Island of Gold), and east of that, probably Sokoto (called &quot;Zogde&quot; in the Catalan Atlas) and much further southeast, probably Kano.
North of the Senegal-Niger are the various oases and stations of the trans-Saharan route (&quot;&quot;Tutega&quot; = Tijigja, &quot;Anzica&quot; = In-Zize, &quot;Tegaza&quot; = Taghaza, etc.) towards the Mediterranean coast. There is an unlabeled depiction of a black African man on a camel traveling from &quot;Uuegar&quot;&quot; (prob. Hoggar) to the town of &quot;Organa&quot; (&quot;&quot;ciutat organa&quot;, variously identified as Kanem or Ouargla or possibly even a misplaced depiction of Ghana - long defunct, but, on the other hand, contemporaneous with the depicted Abu Bakr). Nearby sits its Arab-looking king (&quot;Rex Organa&quot;&quot;) holding a scimitar. The River of Gold is sourced at a circular island, what seem like the Mountains of the Moon (albeit unlabeled here). From this same source also flows north the White Nile towards Egypt, which forms the frontier between the Muslim &quot;king of Nubia&quot; (&quot;&quot;Rex Onubia&quot;, his range depicted by crescent-on-gold banners) and the Christian Prester John (&quot;Preste Joha&quot;), i.e. the emperor of Ethiopia in the garb of a Christian bishop (coincidentally, this is the first visual depiction of Prester John on a portolan chart).

Uniquely, the Viladestes map shows another river, south of the Senegal, which it labels the &quot;flumen gelica&quot; (poss. &quot;angelica&quot;), which some have taken to depict the Gambia River. In the 1459 mappa mundi of Fra Mauro, drawn a half-century later, after the Portuguese had already visited the Senegal (albeit still trying to respect Classical sources), shows &quot;two&quot; parallel rivers running east to west, both of them sourced from the same great internal lake (which, Fra Mauro asserts, is also the same source as the Egyptian Nile). Mauro names the two parallel rivers differently,calling one &quot;flumen Mas&quot; (&quot;Mas River&quot;), the other the &quot;canal dal oro&quot; (&quot;Channel of Gold&quot;), and makes the note that &quot;Inne larena de questi do fiume se trova oro de paiola&quot; (&quot;In the sands of both these rivers gold of &#x27;palola&#x27; may be found&quot;), and nearer to the sea, &quot;Qui se racoce oro&quot; (&quot;Here gold is collected&quot;), and finally, on the coast, &quot;Terra de Palmear&quot; (&quot;Land of Palms&quot;). It is notable that Fra Mauro knew of the error of Henry the Navigator&#x27;s captains about the Daklha inlet, which Mauro carefully labels &quot;&quot;Reodor&quot;&quot; (&quot;Rio do Ouro&quot;, Western Sahara), distinctly from the &quot;Canal del Oro&quot; (Senegal River).

=== European contact ===
Christian Europeans soon began attempting to find the sea route to the mouth of the Senegal. The first known effort may have been by the Genoese brothers Vandino and Ugolino Vivaldi, who set out down the coast in 1291 in a pair of ships (nothing more is heard of them). In 1346, the Majorcan sailor, Jaume Ferrer set out on a galley with the explicit objective of finding the &quot;River of Gold&quot; (&quot;Riu de l&#x27;Or&quot;), where he heard that most people along its shores were engaged in the collection of gold and that the river was wide and deep enough for the largest ships. Nothing more is heard of him either. In 1402, after establishing the first European colony on the Canary Islands, the French Norman adventurers Jean de Béthencourt and Gadifer de la Salle set about immediately probing the African coast, looking for directions to the mouth of Senegal.
The project of finding the Senegal was taken up in the 1420s by the Portuguese Prince Henry the Navigator, who invested heavily to reach it. In 1434, one of Henry&#x27;s captains, Gil Eanes, finally surpassed Cape Bojador and returned to tell about it. Henry immediately dispatched a follow-up mission in 1435, under Gil Eanes and Afonso Gonçalves Baldaia. Going down the coast, they turned around the al-Dakhla peninsula in the Western Sahara and emerged into an inlet, which they excitedly believed to be the mouth of the Senegal River. The name they mistakenly bestowed upon the inlet - &quot;Rio do Ouro&quot; - is a name it would remain stuck with down to the 20th century.

Realizing the mistake, Henry kept pressing his captains further down the coast, and in 1445, the Portuguese captain Nuno Tristão finally reached the Langue de Barbarie, where he noticed the desert end and the treeline begin, and the population change from &#x27;tawny&#x27; Sanhaja Berbers to &#x27;black&#x27; Wolof people. Bad weather or lack of supplies prevented Tristão from actually reaching the mouth of the Senegal River, but he rushed back to Portugal to report he had finally found the &quot;Land of the Blacks&quot; (&quot;Terra dos Negros&quot;), and that the &quot;Nile&quot; was surely nearby. Shortly after (possibly still within that same year) another captain, Dinis Dias (sometimes given as Dinis Fernandes) was the first known European since antiquity to finally reach the mouth of the Senegal River. However, Dias did not sail upriver, but instead kept sailing down the Grande Côte to the bay of Dakar.

The very next year, in 1446, the Portuguese slave-raiding fleet of Lançarote de Freitas arrived at the mouth of the Senegal. One of its captains, Estêvão Afonso, volunteered to take a launch to explore upriver for settlements, thus becoming the first European to actually enter the Senegal river. He didn&#x27;t get very far. Venturing ashore at one point along the river bank, Afonso tried to kidnap two Wolof children from a woodsman&#x27;s hut. But he ran into their father, who proceeded to chase the Portuguese back to their launch and gave them such a beating that the explorers gave up on going any further, and turned back to the waiting caravels.
Sometime between 1448 and 1455, the Portuguese captain Lourenço Dias opened regular trade contact on the Senegal River, with the Wolof statelets of Waalo (near the mouth of the Senegal River) and Cayor (a little below that), drumming up a profitable business exchanging Mediterranean goods (notably, horses) for gold and slaves. Chronicler Gomes Eanes de Zurara, writing in 1453, still called it the &quot;Nile River&quot;, but Alvise Cadamosto, writing in the 1460s, was already calling it the &quot;Senega&quot; , and it is denoted as &quot;Rio do Çanagà&quot; on most subsequent Portuguese maps of the age. Cadamosto relates the legend that both the Senegal and the Egyptian Nile were branches of the Biblical Gihon River that stems from the Garden of Eden and flows through Ethiopia. He also notes that the Senegal was called &quot;the Niger&quot; by the ancients - probably a reference to Ptolemy&#x27;s legendary &#x27;Nigir&#x27; (Νιγειρ) (below the Gir), which would be later identified by Leo Africanus with the modern Niger River. Much the same story is repeated by Marmol in 1573, with the additional note that both the Senegal River and Gambia River were tributaries of the Niger River. However, the contemporary African atlas of Venetian cartographer Livio Sanuto, published in 1588, sketches the Senegal, the Niger and the Gambia as three separate, parallel rivers.
Portuguese chronicler João de Barros (writing in 1552) says the river&#x27;s original local Wolof name was &quot;Ovedech&quot; (which according to one source, comes from &quot;vi-dekh&quot;, Wolof for &quot;this river&quot;). His contemporary, Damião de Góis (1567) records it as &quot;Sonedech&quot; (from &quot;sunu dekh&quot;, Wolof for &quot;our river&quot;). Writing in 1573, the Spanish geographer Luis del Marmol Carvajal asserts that the Portuguese called it &quot;Zenega&quot;, the &#x27;Zeneges&#x27; (Berber Zenaga) called it the &quot;Zenedec&quot;, the &#x27;Gelofes&#x27; (Wolofs) call it &quot;Dengueh&quot;, the &#x27;Tucorones&#x27; (Fula Toucouleur) called it &quot;Mayo&quot;, the &#x27;Çaragoles&#x27; (Soninke Sarakole of Ngalam) called it &quot;Colle&quot; and further along (again, Marmol assuming Senegal was connected to the Niger), the people of Bagamo&#x27; (Bambara of Bamako?) called it &quot;Zimbala&quot; (Jimbala?) and the people of Timbuktu called it the &quot;Yça&quot;.

== Etymology ==
The 16th-century chronicler João de Barros asserts the Portuguese renamed it &quot;Senegal&quot; because that was the personal name of a local Wolof chieftain who frequently conducted business with the Portuguese traders. But this etymology is doubtful (e.g. the ruler of Senegalese river state of Waalo bears the title &#x27;Brak&#x27;, and Cadamosto gives the personal name of the Senegal river chieftain as &quot;Zucholin&quot;). The confusion may have arisen because Cadamosto says the Portuguese interacted frequently with a certain Wolof chieftain south of the river, somewhere on the Grande Côte, which he refers to as &quot;Budomel&quot;. &quot;Budomel&quot; is almost certainly a reference to the ruler of Cayor, a combination of his formal title (&quot;Damel&quot;), prefixed by the generic Wolof term &quot;bor&quot; (&quot;lord&quot;). Curiously, Budomel is reminiscent of &quot;Vedamel&quot; already used by the Genoese back in the 14th century as an alternative name of the Senegal River. It is almost certain that the Genoese &quot;Vedamel&quot; are corruptions from the Arabic, either &quot;Wad al-mal&quot; (&quot;River of Treasure&quot;, i.e. Gold) or, alternatively, &quot;Wad al-Melli&quot; (&quot;River of Mali&quot;) or even, by transcription error, &quot;Wad al-Nill&quot; (&quot;River of Nile&quot;).
Other etymological theories for &quot;Senegal&quot; abound. A popular one, first proposed by Fr. David Boilat (1853), was that &quot;Senegal&quot; comes from the Wolof phrase &quot;sunu gaal&quot;, meaning &quot;our canoe&quot; (more precisely, &quot;our pirogue&quot;). Bailot speculates the name probably arose as a misunderstanding, that when a Portuguese captain came across some Wolof fishermen and asked them what the name of the river was, they believed he was asking who their fishing boat belonged to, and replied simply &quot;it is our canoe&quot; (&quot;sunu gaal&quot;). The &quot;our canoe&quot; theory has been popularly embraced in modern Senegal for its charm and appeal to national solidarity (&quot;we&#x27;re all in one canoe&quot;, etc.).

More recent historians suggest the name &quot;Senegal&quot; is probably a derivation of &quot;Azenegue&quot;, the Portuguese term for the Saharan Berber Zenaga people that lived north of it.

A strong challenge to this theory is that &quot;Senegal&quot; is much older, and might derive from &quot;Sanghana&quot; (also given as Isenghan, Asengan, Singhanah), a city described by the Arab historian al-Bakri in 1068 as located by the mouth of the Senegal River (straddling both banks) and the capital of a local kingdom. The location &quot;Senegany&quot; is depicted in 1351 Genoese map known as the Medici Atlas (Laurentian Gaddiano portolan). This town (&quot;Isingan&quot;) is fantastically depicted in the 1413 portolan map of Majorcan cartographer Mecia de Viladestes . The name itself might be of Berber Zenaga origin, speculatively related to &#x27;Ismegh&#x27; (&#x27;black slave&#x27;, analogous to the Arabic &#x27;abd) or &#x27;sagui nughal&#x27; (&#x27;border&#x27;). Some sources claim &#x27;Isinghan&#x27; remained the usual Berber term to refer to the Wolof kingdom of Cayor.

Some Serer people from the south have advanced the claim that the river&#x27;s name is originally derived from the compound of the Serer term &quot;Sene&quot; (from Rog Sene, Supreme Deity in Serer religion) and &quot;O Gal&quot; (meaning &quot;body of water&quot;).
